tL4McUzXfFI,Hooo Jojo Mukatee Kuru.... Mudaa...Mudaa.... Mudaa....Mudaaa......Muuuudaaaa....
tL4McUzXfFI,"You must understand. The leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians. They hated Russians. They hated Christians. Driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse. The October Revolution was not what you call in America the ‘Russian Revolution.’ It was an invasion and conquest over the Russian people. More of my countrymen suffered horrific crimes at their bloodstained hands than any people or nation ever suffered in the entirety of human history. It cannot be understated. Bolshevism was the greatest human slaughter of all time. The fact that most of the world is ignorant of this reality is proof that the global media itself is in the hands of the perpetrators."" Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn"
tL4McUzXfFI,"just finish watching it. WOW it’s funny and very sad.
Taika Waititi done it again 👏👏👏👏"
tL4McUzXfFI,Next up: a boy from Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden as imaginary friend
tL4McUzXfFI,I saw this last night with my family and laughed from beginning to end. Of course there were sad parts but that was expected and the movie ended perfectly 😍I can’t wait to watch it online when it’s released
tL4McUzXfFI,Only Taika Waititi can make a movie where Hitler is a likable character and still be employed by Disney.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah yes let's leave the anti tank launcher to the kids, what could go wrong?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hey remember when Count Dankula made a harmless Nazi joke and was fined £800 and made to go through the courts longer than the war trials at the hauge...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Omg, a battle tendency's life action"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the best movie I’ve seen in years
tL4McUzXfFI,This is just a movie for kids to learn about the nazis at a early age
tL4McUzXfFI,A croatian boy whos imaginary friend is ante pavelić?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler, black widow and shrek finally united"
tL4McUzXfFI,The best movie ever!
tL4McUzXfFI,When you get rejected by an art school so hard that Disney decided to make a movie about you
tL4McUzXfFI,His the main jojo of pt9
tL4McUzXfFI,🍞🙏🏻
tL4McUzXfFI,"saw it yesterday, hands down, tbe best movie of the year. I laughed and cries both sad and happy tears, defintly a must see"
tL4McUzXfFI,what's the song at 1:08 ?
tL4McUzXfFI,When I saw the title I thought of jojo bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,"Von Stroheim should get a cameo







BRRRRAAAKA MONO GA! DOITSUNO WA KAGA SEGAI ICHI!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This was was beautiful, touching and hilarious. My fave taika waititi movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid with glasses is like a kid version of Nick Frost
tL4McUzXfFI,Where is Stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,This makes wwll seem not as horrible
tL4McUzXfFI,What’s the name of the second song in the trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,Von stroheim backstory looking lit 🔥🔥👌👌
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler's his stand
tL4McUzXfFI,"I saw this movie on Friday, and thought it was genius! Amazing movie that the world needed, I will definitely see it again, and buy the Blu Ray"
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's satire, people. Comical satire at its best... with one serious, historically accurate and awful moment. An excellent movie for those of us who get satire and understand symbolism. This has become my favorite movie of 2019. See it first before you criticize it."
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh wow. Little snowflake left-wing nut jobs are gonna go ballistic about this one. Probably all go cry in their safe spaces and blame Trump for this whole movie too. That dag gone political correctness and all
tL4McUzXfFI,Bloody hell
tL4McUzXfFI,Why doesnt appears von and joseph
tL4McUzXfFI,Rebel Wilson stinks... she makes everything not funny...
tL4McUzXfFI,Next up a French movie with an imaginary nepolian
tL4McUzXfFI,This would make an interesting addition to the fosters home for imaginary friends
tL4McUzXfFI,Lol
tL4McUzXfFI,mandatory film for all the Catalan Nazis...and above all their kids
tL4McUzXfFI,Just one word. Auschwitz. Been there and will not give this film the time of day. Just another 2 words  'bad tast'. People seem to forget what the nazi's did today. I worry for future generations.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jojo part nein, and Hitler is the MC's stand."
tL4McUzXfFI,I was very much enjoying the movie until the moment at the very end when I saw US army in Berlin. Shame on the screenwriters! it was Soviet army (Ukrainian and Belorussian fronts in particular) who entered Berlin. It is a major disappointment that good  movies like that are used to re-write the history and hide some facts about World War Two that used to be well-known.For God’s sake is it possible to at least Google it before making a script?! How does screenwriter sleeps at night?!
tL4McUzXfFI,Just part of the 👃 👃 👃 agenda
tL4McUzXfFI,And this is supposed to be funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,"""It's definitely not a good time to be a nazi"" 😂👌




Vat zo yu min? All de time is a gud time to be a nazi!!! *Erika starts playing*"
tL4McUzXfFI,ITS A MODERFUCKING JOJO'S BIZARRE ANDVENTURE???!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"That movie deserves a Best Picture Oscar. We all know it won't get it, but TOTALLY deserves. 'Jojo Rabbit' is the movie we need in these difficult times."
tL4McUzXfFI,This was such a good movie. Much sadder than I thought it would be from the beginning. The acting was amazing and the plot was unforgettable
tL4McUzXfFI,Is there -possibly- Harry Potter showing up in the movie. If true I ain't gonna watch it...
tL4McUzXfFI,"When Jojo (the kid) says ""a jew?"" To that girl in the bedroom what did she say in response?"
tL4McUzXfFI,They had mevat 2:00 👌😅
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo has imaginary friend who called star platinum.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is bizarre.
You should’ve call it jojo bizarre adventure"
tL4McUzXfFI,They were so disgusted of Jews blood but at the very end the captain declared that jojo is a jew so he could keep his life.
tL4McUzXfFI,The first real anti- fascist movie of the 2020’s. Remember: “They did what they  could!”
tL4McUzXfFI,Has anyone watched this film? I would love to know how it is! It’s giving me Wed Anderson feels.
tL4McUzXfFI,plagio de cuarta categoría de wes anderson con una chorrada de argumento. Basura.

tL4McUzXfFI,This us black widow alternate universe
tL4McUzXfFI,"okay so this movie was AMAZING. I just saw it at the theatres and i want to see it again right away:,)"

tL4McUzXfFI,Pretty soon there will be one about a young Russian boy who's imaginary friend is Joseph Stalin
tL4McUzXfFI,is that a jojo reference? ora ora
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's bizzare adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,One of the best anti-war movies ever made. Somehow a comedy. Somehow a drama. And about love. I'm touched.
tL4McUzXfFI,So Romanov she's a spy since WW2 Ja?
tL4McUzXfFI,"D8

tL4McUzXfFI,Sekai Ichii!!

tL4McUzXfFI,As a jew I am not offended
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler: ""I will burn down the house and blame winston churchil"
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought it was sponge bob song
tL4McUzXfFI,Great movie

tL4McUzXfFI,"In here, young boys with an imaginary Escobar friend"
tL4McUzXfFI,this makes me look like friendly man.Ill sue fegelein for this.
tL4McUzXfFI,hitlers bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,He even looks just like the kid from The Tin Drum 🥁
tL4McUzXfFI,Disbursing to see Hitler depicted in such a family friendly manner.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie was so good, so many sad scenes as well."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is my favorite movie of the year
tL4McUzXfFI,Que Nazi Shrek
tL4McUzXfFI,"I clicked because of ""JOJO,"" and stayed because of Scarlett Johansson."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is pure genius. It had me in tears of laughter in the first 5 minutes. It pulled out every emotion throughout the film.
tL4McUzXfFI,Rubbish
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally I'll have a peek at Germany's science, aka the greatest science in The World."
tL4McUzXfFI,"My favorite Nazi in this film is Rudol Von Stroheim... Wait, what do you mean wrong Jojo?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just watched it, great movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,BRRRRRAAKAMONOGAAAA DOITSU NO KAGAKU WA SEIKAI ICHIII
tL4McUzXfFI,cringefest
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks so unbelievably shit,   seems to get the idea of nazi humour 180 degrees wrong.   Everyone in it looks like a tosser.   

There is going to be completely tame and unbearably sacharine everyone-a-racist message in there"
tL4McUzXfFI,nice !!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Rather the kids watched The greatest story never told.  But then again you cant watch a truthful documentary
tL4McUzXfFI,What's the name of the second song?

tL4McUzXfFI,Wheatley sure chose a dark career path.
tL4McUzXfFI,It's the german Shrek song... this has me mixed
tL4McUzXfFI,If he had mustard this movie would be 10 minutes long
tL4McUzXfFI,This film is a masterpiece.
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s just a shame to make a comedy out of this!
tL4McUzXfFI,if it's not a moonlight kingdom ripoff i don't even know
tL4McUzXfFI,This could be fantastic or leave a very bad taste in your mouth. No inbetween

tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo Part 9: Crazy Noisy Gassy Camp
tL4McUzXfFI,This is gonna sink faster than a heavy turd 💩
tL4McUzXfFI,"Is this a side story about Von Strohiem's son?

Theory: After Jojo was presumed dead by Strohiem, he named his newborn son Jojo to honor him. The reason why Jojo doesn't have a father is because Strohiem died in Stalingrad"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks fantastic. Hopefully this film will get the credit I hear it deserves, but feel a lot of people will jump onto the fact that we shouldn’t make such a horrific theme become the subject of a film. Comedy can always be found in awful places as long as it can be with the best intent. Lack of understanding of irony is usually where people get angry...  

Can’t wait to see this :)"
tL4McUzXfFI,Let's be honest you just seen Jojo you click
tL4McUzXfFI,In India we’ve had an adult with his imaginary friend Gandhi ! Lage raho Munna bhai
tL4McUzXfFI,The guy with the eye was a real gangster. Took one for the homie several times.
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is hilarious.
tL4McUzXfFI,Can Fox do a movie about an orphaned Cambodian child playing with Pol Pot? Maybe they can build play forts with the bones of the child's family? That would be ace! A real side splitter.
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler has happienes
tL4McUzXfFI,"""yeah it's definitely not a good time to be a nazi"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait jojo, nazis
This is just battle tendancy"
tL4McUzXfFI,definatly going to se this fil also I find it hilarious that a film about a Nazi is more popular than both the rise of skywalker and captain marvel
tL4McUzXfFI,0:42 1/10 no 2 s's
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf are my the only one who thinks this is kind of disrespectful
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie's death sentence was written before it even came out.
tL4McUzXfFI,Juden Film.
tL4McUzXfFI,This isn't JOJO
tL4McUzXfFI,He found Anne Frank
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika is the best director of his generation.

tL4McUzXfFI,i wonder how he got the scars
tL4McUzXfFI,Yeah nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,Is Hitler his stand?
tL4McUzXfFI,That little fat kid looks just like Piggy from the original movie Lord of the flies.
tL4McUzXfFI,Although I HATE Hitler and Nazi’s I wanna watch this movie cause it seems funny
tL4McUzXfFI,That's a useless stand
tL4McUzXfFI,Time to burn some books! YAAY

tL4McUzXfFI,LOL this looks right up my alley :D
tL4McUzXfFI,"The ultimate insult to the Nazis, Hitler being played by a half Jew half Māori person in a anti racism comedy movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,Not sure how I feel about this...
tL4McUzXfFI,Ahh....What a Nazi Friendly Movie...
tL4McUzXfFI,🤨✋🏻😂
tL4McUzXfFI,what is his stand?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I swear the casual way Merchant says ""Hail Hitler"" was soo funny."
tL4McUzXfFI,*NAZI's BIZARRE ADVENTURE!*
tL4McUzXfFI,I’ve watched this trailer and I just don’t get it. Surely something’s are off limits.

Me: jesus watch it

Realises what I said*

Me:2:06"
tL4McUzXfFI,Isn't this just boy in the stripped pyjamas?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Fun fact: Germans during the 3rd Reich never referred to themselves as ""Nazi"", it was a derogatory term for backward peasants used long before the rise of NSPD and Hitler and then later propagandised by Judea and the allies.
Hitler actually despised the word."
tL4McUzXfFI,Awfull movie only mocking
tL4McUzXfFI,Trump's Christmas movie

In JoJo part 2, part of the protagonists were Nazis. Hm"
tL4McUzXfFI,I really hope to see Stroenheim in this bizarre movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Moonrise Kingdom meets Nazi's
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie has a lot of heart and portrays the Nazis as the idiots they were!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Came because I thought I looked great. 
Stated because of David Bowie

Imma see this"
tL4McUzXfFI,"When you have seen ""The dictator"" by/with Chaplin.. this low quality parody is a real bullshit. A movie showing Hitler as a ""funny guy"" makes me to throw up"
tL4McUzXfFI,tell me a NAZI movie that is not a hit.
tL4McUzXfFI,This film looks shit
tL4McUzXfFI,Truly Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,"0:40 a warm, calm and friendly greeting from the Das Land der Dichter und Denker"

I’ve seen people laugh at this but I don’t know why"
tL4McUzXfFI,Sorry i tougjt literal jojo.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nothing holly left in Hollywood,not even genecide and death of millions of people will stop them to grab few coins 😡"
tL4McUzXfFI,"When do we get the Texas boy who loves guns and wants to be a Republican, with a Trump-like figure as his imaginary friend?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks great. But comedy as old as it can be about Nazis? Here: https://youtu.be/-HA8kSdsf_M
tL4McUzXfFI,Greta thunberg looks different here
tL4McUzXfFI,why though?
tL4McUzXfFI,this film looks like a wes anderson film but it's not
tL4McUzXfFI,a nazi family friendly movie.. okok cool cool
tL4McUzXfFI,Saw the movie. I can confirm that it is nothing short of spectacular.
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh but they won't do one about the Soviet union right?
tL4McUzXfFI,When the nazis lost the war... I don’t know if you knew... that the nazis lost that war...?
tL4McUzXfFI,"....superb film all round - I was born in the U.K. just after WW2, and the German marbling in me can’t help feeling for poor Joseph Bien (“The gas washed and fleece farmer!” - whatever the hell that is) after the boys (portraying their roles brilliantly) inadvertently launch, what to me looks like a Raketenpanzerbuchse anti-tank rocket at Joseph’s establishment – cracked me up all the same, just as it did everyone else watching."
tL4McUzXfFI,What is the age rating I'm 14 and really want to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,Yo wtf is this like actually wtf is this allowed?
tL4McUzXfFI,Fox? Ironic...
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is film has a much higher chance of winning Oscar for ""Best Picture "" in 2020 than Joker and others.  The film is not as it looks in the trailer...there is going to be something very dark in it at a latter stage, I am sure of it. This film will have something positive in it,  will make the people laugh and cry, will teach  the people something."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wonder how hard permission to make a film like this was
tL4McUzXfFI,So I just got recommended the Japanese trailer for the movie. For those interested: https://youtu.be/L4rFW69Ypk0
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, I did NAZI that coming"
tL4McUzXfFI,i bet there will be a movie of a muslim boy whos friend is alahu akbar
tL4McUzXfFI,YOU UTTER FOOL! GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE WORLD FINEST!
tL4McUzXfFI,If this is done well I'll eat my words but I feel like there is a risk that this kids movie may fail at approaching the subject matter. I hope I'm wrong. I'd hate for them to have accidentally made a film that Nazis love and show their kids. Like I know the premise and intent. I'd just be amazed if they stick the landing.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is Jurj Clooners in this movie or...?
tL4McUzXfFI,"You're not Nazi, Jojo. You're a stand user.
STAND NAME: Hitler had only one big ball
STAND MASTER: Jojo Rabbit"

tL4McUzXfFI,Did they get permission from Atlus to use the likeness of the final boss from Persona 2: Innocent Sin in this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,"As much as it's innocent I still think this is disrespectful. Because it's playing on a very serious and real history. Watch ww2 in colour, it's gruesome... we might of not been alive at the time but it's still our ancestors. And still, just... in living memory. I don't rate it at all, it's not funny, it's not respectful, and it won't make the history any easier to watch or learn. And it's made by a director who grew up out in blissful NZ where little effected the population. Not nothing though. About a Europe which was in it from day one. Which saw one of the worst acts in modern history. And suddenly this is okay to joke about so light heartedly. Personally I don't think it's a good idea. But it's done and some people would like it."
tL4McUzXfFI,I've just watched this trailer before I watched the thing I wanted to watch it's says it's one of the best films of the year then says it's in cinemas new years day so how the fuck can you say this is one of the best films of the year when it looks like complete bollox and isn't even out yet great production
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a comedy about hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t know what to think of this
tL4McUzXfFI,very fitting when you're learning about the Hitler Youth
tL4McUzXfFI,02:07 that is literly me haha
tL4McUzXfFI,Ohh so this is JJBA Part 9
tL4McUzXfFI,𝙠𝙤𝙣𝙤 𝙖𝙙𝙤𝙡𝙛 𝙝𝙞𝙩𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙣𝙞𝙬𝙖 𝙮𝙪𝙢𝙚 𝙜𝙖 𝙖𝙧𝙪....
tL4McUzXfFI,"I think Adam Driver is the front runner. His performance is so reminiscent of Dustin Hoffman for ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" as well as the scene of the gate closing in the film is such an homage to the ending of Best Picture 1979 ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" its insane. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar and the film won Best Picture. I could also see the Academy putting Ana de Armas as a Best Supporting Actress, just like Alicia Vikander in ""The Danish Girl"" and therefore winning."
tL4McUzXfFI,A weak attempt to make the nazis look silly??? What is this propaganda???
tL4McUzXfFI,Congratulations Pewdiepie for his first major role in a movie!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Spoiler alert

tL4McUzXfFI,Why would you need history books when you have this

tL4McUzXfFI,"This is *BIZZARE*

*HITLER THEME STARTS PLAYING*"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler: Official bogeyman since 1939. 

Forget Mao, Stalin, Polpot, Pinochet. There's only one you'll ever be persistently reminded of. Hitler is top dog of bad guys."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh look, another nazi film..... 

Here, a theme persists where concern is made towards a boy bring too young to be concerned with politics. I agree with that point entirely. 

Of course, I also note the hypocrisy. It seems there is an apparent acceptable exception when it comes the the 'right' politics. Like climate change for example...."
tL4McUzXfFI,Whats the music/ song that starts around 1:12?? Please helpp
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm Sick of Nazi & Hitler Movies, Even if Funny."
tL4McUzXfFI,I do nazi why this is offensive to some people.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Most of JoJo fans are already aware that not every nazi was a bad person since we know and love a certain Nazi that wasn't that bad and we actually mourned his death in the hands of the red army.
R.I.P My favorite cyborg Nazi, you died being the greatest cyborg nazi in the world."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Explanation of tragedy through the comedy, keep it up."

tL4McUzXfFI,ID HIS FATHER IS HITLER ?
tL4McUzXfFI,I never watch movie trailers until after the movie and am so glad I did not. It would have ruined the movie. Makes no sense at all.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a kids movie I'm confused and Is it out and if not wen is it If any of u know
tL4McUzXfFI,BRRRKA MONOGA DOITSU NO KAGAKU WA SEKAI ICHI

tL4McUzXfFI,Is the song near the end Under Pressure by Queen or someone else?
tL4McUzXfFI,Best movie of all time!🤯
tL4McUzXfFI,"''dressing up in funny uniforms, wanting to be a part of the club''. Is she talking of antifa and self-proclaimed liberals who never question what mainstream media tells, ignoring facts because they want to be a part of the club?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Anybody knows second song? :)
tL4McUzXfFI,Ay wey
tL4McUzXfFI,So we’re gonna ignore the fact that Hitler is in this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,They are not teaching the truth about that happened to the Jews in school. I don’t think this will help either. We need to remember the truth about WW Il !
tL4McUzXfFI,Best movie of the year
tL4McUzXfFI,Watch them pull a boy in the stripped Pajamas on us
tL4McUzXfFI,"I laughed, Taika is one of my fAv directors but this is by far, his worst film.  It seems like “making it big” means selling your craft to the studios.  Scarlet is a babe but what a terrible actor.. and that fake accent? She plays the same role in every movie,  hottie next door girl + role (super hero/German mother/hottie next door girl)"
tL4McUzXfFI,For which People is that movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,this is honestly my favorite movie I've ever seen. Its powerful in so many ways I just wanna watch it over and over and over. Can't wait to get it on DVD.

tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone realize the song is from regular show ending
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait so his mother harbours Jews but let’s u son idolise hitler and train to become a nazi?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Honestly Hitler does have a point, the Buddhists are the worst race."
tL4McUzXfFI,I seriously don’t know how this can be turned into a comedy. Very bad taste. I will be skipping this one.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, the USA has always helped Nazism develop. Yesterday in Germany, and today in Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine."
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid with the glasses is like a younger version of Nick Frost.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh look GCSE English, it’s Piggy"
tL4McUzXfFI,I like how they showed the Swastika. Oh... wait...
tL4McUzXfFI,It could have a sequel with JOseph Stalin as an imaginary friend
tL4McUzXfFI,So Hitler is his imaginary friend?
tL4McUzXfFI,Ridicules
tL4McUzXfFI,"I've watched this movie only 3 times so far, and I've got to say, This is probably one of my favorite movies Ever, and not just in 2019. It's Funny, sad and is just a Great movie over all. I definitely Think You should watch it if you haven't already. You will honestly be surprised. I laughed and Cried, Which is surprising. I don't really Ever get this Moved by a Movie. Anyways that's just my honest review and opinion. 👍"
tL4McUzXfFI,You've got to love the fact that David Bowie's song 'heroes' about the Berlin wall is being played in German in the background.
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to meet a Jew so I can use that joke.
tL4McUzXfFI,"David Bowie:we could be hero"" the German version,love it🤣🤣🤣"
tL4McUzXfFI,Making jokes about such a black period in human history is not everyones taste.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Huge congratulations to Roman on getting a Golden Globe nomination! (Oh, and also the film itself!)"

tL4McUzXfFI,Great movie for РОССИИ
tL4McUzXfFI,"Normally they would run a disclaimer that no animal or person was harmed in the making of this film but at the start of this they should put that 11 million Jew's, those of the lgbtq+ and people of colour died to bring you this film"
tL4McUzXfFI,"what the actual fuck, im not trying to be anoyying but its really hard for me to watch this comedy about ww2, when my family back then had to flee and saw their loved ones die in front of their eyes and they had to live in a destroyed world in extreme poverty. this is one of those things you don't joke about"

 V





Just watch the movie today and I can say that I really enjoyed it, I came in expecting a lot and when you do that with movies your normally don’t like it that much cause you were expecting something crazy, so it’s best to go in with a bad mind set, but I went in thinking high about this movie and this beat my expectations! One of the best comedies I’ve seen to date. The movie starts off very comedic but slowly tryna into a serious but incredibly heartwarming movie. The chapters are so lovable and fun to watch. Would definitely recommend watching if you haven’t already!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a movie about Stronheim childhood
tL4McUzXfFI,"All the folks who wrote negative comments have read the book and seen the movie, I guess? 🤷‍♂️"
tL4McUzXfFI,1:12 I think you mean Bomber Harris.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ok so I just saw this movie today. Parents, this IS DEFINITELY NOT A MOVIE YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO BE WATCHING. It’s so inappropriate. This kid is literally 10 and saying curse words 😑🤦‍♀️"
tL4McUzXfFI,Name of the song??
tL4McUzXfFI,*BRRRAAKA MONOGA !! GERMANYS SIENCE IS THE FINEST IN THE WORLD*
tL4McUzXfFI,Best ads method: add Jojo References
tL4McUzXfFI,Am i the only one who thinks that the fat kid is going to steal every scene he is in?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just saw it last night, such a great movie !!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this part 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,Just saw this movie. Absolutely bloody amazing.
tL4McUzXfFI,A movie about Nazi Germany that speaks English. Are we sure the British and Americans didn't already win?
tL4McUzXfFI,If I get in trouble I will burn down the evidence and blame trump
tL4McUzXfFI,Fun fact the director is Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,looks good!
tL4McUzXfFI,Smash mouth is cannon now.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't think I want to go see this, because it appears to be too lighthearted and disrespectful for such a serious subject as the Holocaust, eventhough I kinda see it's intentions. It seems done in poor taste. I've got friends and loved ones that are Jewish and I don't want to see anything that offends them.  I feel this way about all the other similar films before it. Remember the movie ""Life is Beautiful""?? That's a film that respected the Holocaust victims with a perfect and adequate sense of humor"
tL4McUzXfFI,This film has been the biggest load of bollocks.
tL4McUzXfFI,"When JoJo and his mom found people hung in the streets, and his mom told him sternly not to look away, I feel that sums this entire film up.

Yes, JoJo Rabbit WILL make you uncomfortable. Yes, you WILL instinctively look down or cover your eyes for a second like I did. But slowly open your eyes again. You need to be shown this.


Don’t look away."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Me to the writer of this travesty of a film: HOW ARE YOU ALLOWED TO WALK THE STREETS, MORON!!!?? - Trevor Phillips."
tL4McUzXfFI,this movie AND  comment section is a fucking diamond xD
tL4McUzXfFI,Some people reich this kind of stuff. Get back Jo Jo.
tL4McUzXfFI,What's the bowie song in the second half of the trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this movie on Netflix
tL4McUzXfFI,a dude i met on minecraft thought it was funny that my name starts with jo and now he calls me jojo rabbit .. bruh
tL4McUzXfFI,"I thought it was JJBA 
But its about hitler 
So ok"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Waititi!
Johansson!!
Rockwell!!!
Bowie!!!!

sadly... Wilson.

nonetheless, sign me up!"
tL4McUzXfFI,I bet the liberals will call this movie “alt right nazi propaganda”
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the stupidest feed sorry for the poor little Jew propaganda movie I've ever seen
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought they were going to close the comments. Wo!
tL4McUzXfFI,we've reached levels of judaism we did not think possible.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I think Taika Waititi is Jewish.

So that makes it okay right guys. Guys?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitlers gonna end up being my favorite character isnt he....
tL4McUzXfFI,The main character is named JOJO and can see someone that can move stuff around whilst nobody can see them. This movie is officially a JOJO spin off.
tL4McUzXfFI,Garbage
tL4McUzXfFI,an out come all the oversensitive triggered clowns protesting because this movie hurted thier wittle feelings 😆😄😅
tL4McUzXfFI,This is horrible
tL4McUzXfFI,"Another Nazi movie great. Can we do the same for say Africans, Red Indian tribes whose home were stolen etc?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"1:40 Nazis are not aliens, they were mostly Germans and Austrians..."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really stupid which is why I am not going to watch it.
tL4McUzXfFI,I was high af watching this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Are they singing "" heroes"" in dss german? Awesome trailer"
tL4McUzXfFI,Stephen Merchant looks like Herr Flick from Allo Allo!
tL4McUzXfFI,"*I REJECT MY JUDAISM, JOJO!*"
tL4McUzXfFI,I did nazi this coming.
tL4McUzXfFI,One of the strangest movies I've seen this year.
tL4McUzXfFI,What happen to mine Furher?
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Is that a jojo reference!?"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"I just saw this film. It was excellent! I was worried it'd be a tad too preachy, but it didn't put it's message before the story and characters. Very solid dramadey!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"1:23
Wut"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Next up, a movie about a Japanese boy who's imaginary friend is Hideki Tojo"
tL4McUzXfFI,Personally my fav movie of the whole year! PLEASE support this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,wes anderson
tL4McUzXfFI,One of the better movies I've seen in the past few years.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This trailer ruined Jojo Rabbit for me. It's basically the whole movie condensed into 2 and 1/2 minutes. 
It's no Lighthouse."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie seems to be a fucking JoJo's reference :v
tL4McUzXfFI,Korg in the multiverse looking hella weird
tL4McUzXfFI,I watched this movie it’s soooo good
tL4McUzXfFI,"""You're a 10 yo kid that likes dressing up in a funny uniform and be part of a club"" - excellent description of all skinheads"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler wasn’t Jojo’s imaginary friend, he was simply a projection of one side of Jojo’s thoughts."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is amazing! I loved it!
tL4McUzXfFI,Watched it today it’s very funny then it gets serious. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend anyone who likes to laugh
tL4McUzXfFI,Sara Jonasen ....are you Jojo s mom?
tL4McUzXfFI,His imaginary friend is hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,I know why because Hitler is dead
tL4McUzXfFI,Those are Americans at 1:43
tL4McUzXfFI,0:57
tL4McUzXfFI,I saw this. It should win best of everything= A+ but it won't alas.
tL4McUzXfFI,I saw this and like it how ever I would not call this a comment
tL4McUzXfFI,"Smash Mouth, Jojo, and Nazis. Now that's a movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder how Modern Day Germany will react to this...
tL4McUzXfFI,Better than the actual hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I like it I love it 0:40
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is Netflix adaptation of lost Jojo's bizarre adventure movie
tL4McUzXfFI,should be called my friend hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,Saw this movie today and it was hilarious. Then I realized towards the end that people(mostly the kids towards the end) actually went through some of the things jojo goes through and still do to this day and I had to take a sec to push back the tears. 10/10 will watch again.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I searched up ""propaganda jojo"" but I then found a movie I didn't know about. I am proud of the amount of Jojo comments though."
tL4McUzXfFI,This trailer song... wtf is it? It was in another movie and got stuck in my head awhile ago....
tL4McUzXfFI,Oy Vey
tL4McUzXfFI,Esau's silly ass at it again.
tL4McUzXfFI,So you know how the minions in the Minions movie were trying to serve the baddest villain throughout history. In the movie they skipped over who the minions served in WWII. 🤔
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie was fucking awesome.    My favorite but was the two gay characters and to be real they were the best queer side characters I've seen in a movie or TV show in a while. And the reason is that they actually followed the rule of ""show don't tell"". That made the characters that much more iconic."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie blew me away! Loved it!
tL4McUzXfFI,A movie about Trump Youth Camp.
tL4McUzXfFI,me and the boys: the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,How is this popular?!
tL4McUzXfFI,We burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill
tL4McUzXfFI,Dieser Film über das Kaninchen ist brillant! vor allem die szene mit der gestapo! Urkomisch!
tL4McUzXfFI,"В Рашке не выйдет,можешь не надеяться.)"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just watched this last night. The trailer makes it look like only a comedy (Though there is a lot of comedy), but there's a lot of heart towards the end. Go see it!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Are you sure this is not a Wes Anderson movie, music, lighting and colors."
tL4McUzXfFI,I wish that is my school
tL4McUzXfFI,That 6th part of JoJo is realistic as heck
tL4McUzXfFI,i thought this is jojo movies form anime but it a...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand Master:USSR
Stand name:communism"
tL4McUzXfFI,"YouTube algorithm:let’s put something with JoJo in that dude’s recommendations since he likes JJBA so he might click on it
Me:*clicks on the video*
YouTube algorithm:ha fool you fell for it thunder cross split attack !"
tL4McUzXfFI,WHY?
tL4McUzXfFI,"They should do a film about a Christian boy in the Soviet Union being kept safe in the attic.  I would watch that one.  This ""Nazi's are evil"" crap has been a dead horse theme for a long time.  It's time to change things up."
tL4McUzXfFI,The main actor is best child actor I’ve ever seen
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the wildest movie ever 😅😅
tL4McUzXfFI,This Jojo movie looks good hope it stats true to the manga
tL4McUzXfFI,"After all, German science is the greatest in the world."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jojo ? 
Yare yare daze"
tL4McUzXfFI,yyyyyyeeeeeessssssss
tL4McUzXfFI,I just saw this movie. It was pretty good.
tL4McUzXfFI,"If only so many of my grandfather's generation hadn't lost their lives, so the producers of this cack could live."
tL4McUzXfFI,"What's the second song in the trailer called, the one after I'm a believer"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,"Looks awesome, this will piss off some Jews."
tL4McUzXfFI,The trailer doesn't do the movie justice. I just watched this tonight and it was honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen. If that kid doesn't get an Oscar or at least some award I'm going to be pissed.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo bizarre aventure nazi edition
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is fucked up, if any of you actually find humour in the racism of the Jewish people then you should be disgraced of yourself.                Wether if it’s a kid movie or not this should be banned"
tL4McUzXfFI,YOU UTTER FOOL! GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE FINEST IN THE WORLD!
tL4McUzXfFI,Halter kicking the table lol
tL4McUzXfFI,0:35 holy crap.
tL4McUzXfFI,"“It’s definitely not a good time to be a Nazi”
Was there really EVER a good time"
tL4McUzXfFI,Where is the scene when Jojo Giovanna pierces his stand with the arrow?
tL4McUzXfFI,Very good movie
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THAT A JOJOS REFERENCE?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie was so good I couldn’t stop laughing. At times it seemed like a decent budget movie and at others people doing a skit. Seemed like the actors involved just had fun with it and really liked it. To bad in today’s age this has been seen as to controversial so it probably won’t get the money and praise it deserves. Really well done to all the actors, writers, and everyone involved."
tL4McUzXfFI,near the ending was so sad.. the guy in the great uniform and i think his buddy died..
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 looks weird. I can’t believe there’s a Deutschlandlied stand
tL4McUzXfFI,"Honestly, this makes me think of the day i finally realized adults could be awful and wrong. 
Tht is the day youre no longer a child."
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to watch this so badly
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waikiki as Hitler looks like Freddy Armisen in Portlandia
tL4McUzXfFI,How about a Satire on why the Germans disliked the Jews i?   It would only be fair...why not ?  After all the old saw of hiding behind  anti semitism  has worn out its teeth ... people realize its a farce. So why not finally see the other side of the story in SATIRE on the big screen... again WHY NOT?
tL4McUzXfFI,2:01 XD
tL4McUzXfFI,Really missed an opportunity to play Neutral Milk Hotel in the trailer....
tL4McUzXfFI,I have to watch this movie for no reason 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"😂 😂 😂 
WHAT IS THIS MOVIE?!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Am I stupid or did their German accents disappear halfway through the trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Memes aside, I saw this film opening night in my city, and left the theater not only imbued with a sense of hope and goodness, but left with many questions and plenty of answers. It's a film that not only has an important message, but respects it fully, never going off the rails. It blends comedy and drama perfectly, and contains a scene towards the end so powerful, I got chills. In my opinion, it's really close in my top running for the best film of the year. Well done to Mr. Waititi, I'm positive you've made a masterpiece."
tL4McUzXfFI,An absolutely beautiful film! Loved every single hilarious & emotional moment of it.
tL4McUzXfFI,What's it called?
tL4McUzXfFI,Every historian out there: *I WATCH IT!!!*
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm afraid that this movie wont be dubed in Germany :(
tL4McUzXfFI,"Child and Hilter:I got it
Child: *Babbles*
Hilter:Burn the house and blame it on winston Churchill
Winston Churchill:Tf?"

tL4McUzXfFI,jojo bizzare adventure part 6 trailer is great :)
tL4McUzXfFI,doitsu no kagaku wa sekai ichi!
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie won't be making millions on merch I assume
tL4McUzXfFI,"10% Comments: Oh, nazi film
90% Comments: IS THIS JOJO REFERENCE??"
tL4McUzXfFI,Guys I have an idea. Let’s not make anime references.
tL4McUzXfFI,He one with the joestar family.!!!!!!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Never forget the wartime misstreatment of a handfull Polish buisness owners.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand User: JoJo
Stand: [ZA FUHRER]"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I didn't even know this film was a thing until a company criticized it, and I'm liking it, it's hilarious"
tL4McUzXfFI,Didnt know that a movie about Nazi germany could look so fun and lively
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this okay?
tL4McUzXfFI,This was not the Jojo I was looking for
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just watched this night before last. It is a GREAT, GREAT, GREAT movie!! I strongly recommend watching this if you have the opportunity."
tL4McUzXfFI,What utter rubbish
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie was made as propaganda to poke fun at the NSDAP and to make morons who don't study actual history (not one sided history written by the victors and communists) the story is not one sided, I recommend you look at history through the prospective of both sides. 

For the true story of the 3rd Reich and what really happened, watch this documentary... Ww2 revisionism exists for a reason, and that is because there is more to the story than what our liberal history books tells us, and evidence that supports a different narrative.. Don't dismiss an opportunity to understand the truth.

Fox: excuse me what the fu—?

_Screen goes sepiatone with “Yes” by Roundabout playing. A black arrow saying _*_“TO BE CONTINUED...”_*_ appears in the bottom right corner_"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was so good.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks cool, yeah, 

BUT WHERE IS STROHEIM?!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,What a focken great movie

tL4McUzXfFI,Great movie.  Very funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks... weird
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks good! Excited for this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone here for the German version of Heroes?
tL4McUzXfFI,Was some of the best writting iv seen in a long time GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Phooo, this is such a good movie but for all that humor it's still about as intense as you'd expect a story about Nazi Germany to be. Man what a lot of feels."
tL4McUzXfFI,That stielhandgranate would have shredded him to pieces at that distance
tL4McUzXfFI,"*""Were The Basterds""*"

tL4McUzXfFI,Holy jesus we just need kim jong un in a family movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm a real history nerd when it comes to ww2!! And this movie really tickled my fancy.
Seeing all that equipment and vehicles, to seeing how they potraid the Hitler youth and the state of Germany in 1945, and somehow mixing in comedy! Dark humor, making fun of nazis while seeing germany in a authentic manner."
tL4McUzXfFI,Goty
tL4McUzXfFI,"""It's definitely not a good time to be a Nazi"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Trailers ruin movie plots...
tL4McUzXfFI,U people r missing the point. This is about the innocence of childhood. There’s people who don’t want to teach about the holocaust because it’s traumatizing to mental health. So what do u want? The dark truths or this? U cant get rid of the past so choose one!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Comments ought to be disabled for every video regardless. I like reading them, but this way no one gets offensive or bent out of shape by a comment!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,A comedy movie about the hitler youth *now this something that i want to see*
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THIS A MADAFUCKING JOJO REFERENCE? NO WAY
tL4McUzXfFI,"great movie, spoiler germany loses the war"

tL4McUzXfFI,JOJO'S VS HITLER
tL4McUzXfFI,Just got back from watching this movie - what a hilarious and heartwarming movie :) highly recommend!
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 looks bizarre
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler oh I don't think so
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was a piece of dog schnitzel
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks fantastic, definitely looking forward to this."
tL4McUzXfFI,Pucci what the hell have you done
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok does anyone know what that tune is toward the end of the trailer....I am racking my brain out trying to figure it out.
tL4McUzXfFI,This was actually really good. I had my reservations going in but left the theater impressed and emotionally touched. Kudos to all involved with this film.
tL4McUzXfFI,Kabalist bankers funded Hitler via Wehrmacht ( https://www.henrymakow.com/001936.html ).
tL4McUzXfFI,"George Soros, Hungarian born Jew and globalist Zionist, said that the Nazi occupation was one of the happiest times of his life. He also said he had no  regrets about being a collaborator. (Source: 60 Minutes - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWizajL7tA )"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Why did you and the film director make fun of something so deadly, and serious?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ich bekomme ein Like von jedem, der diesen Kommentar übersetzt. Ich werde diesen Film auf jeden Fall sehen."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Don't be a dummy, be a smarty..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I can see this will be a very controversial movie
tL4McUzXfFI,The officer and mom are the best characters tbh
tL4McUzXfFI,"I read the title as Jojo siwa 
“Jojo siwa | official trailer | “"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting such a wholesome story in a movie about a little nazi boy and his best friend Adolph Hitler. 
Nor was I expecting references to Jojo part 8, but hey, the movie was pretty based."
tL4McUzXfFI,Joseph Joestar
tL4McUzXfFI,R u kidding??!? Wtf..... 🤦‍♀️
tL4McUzXfFI,Johansson looks to much like a jew to play a german.
tL4McUzXfFI,Woah! Is that literally Hitler!?
tL4McUzXfFI,Jooooooojo - Dio 1889
tL4McUzXfFI,Just saw this and it is amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,"Making a comedy about fascism,is like making a comedy about pedophilia,some things are not funny."
tL4McUzXfFI,Second song?
tL4McUzXfFI,I just nowrealized the translation of ”I'm a Believer”
tL4McUzXfFI,My dead grandparents will love this show
tL4McUzXfFI,when the mom dies tho..... sorry spoiler alert
tL4McUzXfFI,I just wanted to see Hitler jump over his soliders
tL4McUzXfFI,"Saw it earlier today. Some of the scenes were so dark, and they weren’t from the DC Universe."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is more of a drama than a comedy. Still funny and great though.
I just was super high expecting a hilarious movie but got slapped with some serious sad moments."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I guess nobody finds it interesting/ironic that all of the liberal Hollywood ""comedians"" who espouse the existence of white supremacy in America are in fact the ones contributing to the ongoing narrative of white supremacy existing in America. A ""comedy"" wrapped in liberal propaganda to convince you that a problem exists which doesn't exist. Trash."
tL4McUzXfFI,The saddest part was when Jojo saw his mom hanged 😭
tL4McUzXfFI,tf
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or does the kid with glasses look like piggy from Lord Of The Flies
tL4McUzXfFI,"Bro, so this is the reboot of Battle Tendency on the SBR universe?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"""she treats me like a person""

I feel sorry for all the Jews during this era"
tL4McUzXfFI,What a beautiful evil
tL4McUzXfFI,I loved this movie I would go see it again.
tL4McUzXfFI,Ohh his imaginary friend is hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,This ENTIRE movie is a JoJo reference.
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does he look like the little girl from The Grinch who stole Christmas?
tL4McUzXfFI,I came here looking for a Jojo reference and found gold
tL4McUzXfFI,A movie about Germans: *has british and American actors*
tL4McUzXfFI,"My sister & I saw this last night & we both thought it was really funny, very sweet, had great commentary on the stupidity of racism, fanaticism, war mongering, & the importance of celebrating life through all of the ups & downs we experience. ❤️"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Scarlett Johansson,  Strong Aryan.   Great mother.  Encourages son's sexual independence, is happy that he is playing with Hitler Youth, is proud of her son.


Joy Behar, Insufferable Jew.  Horrible mother.  Makes son feel guilty about sex, is repulsed that he is playing with Hitler Youth, and let's him know he is a dissapointment."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was so funny and sad
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hope all the kids die in the end, just to make it the saddest satire"
tL4McUzXfFI,"damn, this trailer gives a bunch away. But still, such a great movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Teacher: Time to burn some books!
Kids: Yay!!!!!!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Describes the morons who follow antifa
tL4McUzXfFI,"Cant watch it
Dont watch anime"
tL4McUzXfFI,Just watch the movie yesterday. Very good.
tL4McUzXfFI,I can already feel the hate going towards this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope this will bring back the downfall memes
tL4McUzXfFI,It is absolutely not ok for a movie to make fun of something like this. Who ever came up with this should be ashamed of themselfs
tL4McUzXfFI,"We need these two kids to play in a movie along with Nick Frost and Simon Pegg playing their older versions, directed by Edgar Wright and Taika Waititi, with a joke somewhere in there about trying to leap over fences."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I saw this movie and I want to say that if you are thinking about seeing this movie, SEE IT!! It is utterly phenomenal and even though its less of a comedy than it says, its really a marvelous movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I've tried to put myself inside the mind of a democrat. Now I completely understand them , the lunacy , fantasies and their insanity."
tL4McUzXfFI,Hope the movie has a happy ending where the jew gets caught
tL4McUzXfFI,Came to dislike cause this movie looks fhking retarded
tL4McUzXfFI,there should be a part in wolfenstein where you get ahold of a minigun and shred down a crowd of nazi soldiers where the song that plays in this trailer plays calmly
tL4McUzXfFI,*why would you say something so brave yet controversial*
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I feel this sudden feeling of cringe
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm pretty sure this whole movie is a jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t why but I feel like this going to be something like the interview
tL4McUzXfFI,Can someone tell me how old the Jewish girl is supposed to be. Cuz sometimes she looks like she could be like 13 and others it looks like she could be 20. Just the way she stand next to Jojo and is like 5 inches taller has me confused.
tL4McUzXfFI,The alternate universe version of JoJo Part 2.
tL4McUzXfFI,This kid deserves every award for Best Actor. Phenomenal.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I thinking of GT, another child brainwashed by the government and ""science""."
tL4McUzXfFI,Fascist propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,okay prepare for angry parents saying “tHerE oS AloT oF bAd iMageS ans SIGneZ”
tL4McUzXfFI,This was an awesome movie 👏  . I cringed then got slapped in the face.   laughed I cried and laughed some more and cried some more .A movie to own
tL4McUzXfFI,"To make a comedy out of this subject is very disgraceful!!! I can’t believe it. They should ban this. And Scarlet Johansson should be ashamed! I thought she was Jewish, but either way, she’s made a mockery out of her acting career."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie fuckin gave me whip lash. It was beautifully shot, funny, and sad. Amazing movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,Who keeps getting ads for this movie after watching JJBA videos?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Great, now we need one about Stalin."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ths is so cringe, so not spontaneous. Eventually will watch on streaming, like 30 min during a week until finally finish, but 2hs in a roll it is a bit too much."
tL4McUzXfFI,"1:04
Imagine if he hot raped on the spot"
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo part 9 looks great!
tL4McUzXfFI,NEIN
tL4McUzXfFI,when a nazi movie actually looks lighthearted
tL4McUzXfFI,This seems like a story in the eyes of a young kid and then he will probably see how f up reality is really in.
tL4McUzXfFI,I can smell the triggered boomers miles away
tL4McUzXfFI,"Watches JoJo Rabbit trailer
Gets JoJo Rabbit ad"

tL4McUzXfFI,About to see this with my gamer girl this is epic guys
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hate everything about it. Everything. Listening to ""Heroes"" in that context annoys me."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Pause and click 0:27.      Hitler's face just says "" I'm not supposed to die till 1945, I can't go early!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"So they're delaying Stone Ocean to have this OVA, eh?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to go well
tL4McUzXfFI,"i saw this last night and it was hilarious
10/10 would recommend"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Awww I really wanna watch it, but danish cinemas don't show it 😥"
tL4McUzXfFI,I think the man that looks like adolf hitler is actually his stand
tL4McUzXfFI,If Hitler wasn't as anti-semitic.
tL4McUzXfFI,Where is Stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,2:00 🤣🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,Everyone already knows a Nazi made this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo’s bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a Jojo reference?!
tL4McUzXfFI,STROHEIM WOULD BE SO PROUD.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait! Is that Hitler? 🤦🏻‍♀️
tL4McUzXfFI,Me will kome
tL4McUzXfFI,I Did Natzee that Coming
tL4McUzXfFI,2:10 Hitler's soliers at the end of WWII be like
tL4McUzXfFI,BRAAAAKAAA MONOGAAAA!!
tL4McUzXfFI,No just no
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie is a disgrace, how could you make fun of such a serious time in history"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is very good. I recommend it
tL4McUzXfFI,The nuremberg rallies look awfully similar to the hillbilly rallies.. history repeats itself
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks bomb, how did I not see this?!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Fuck outta here
tL4McUzXfFI,"I just went and saw ""Midway"". I noticed I was among the youngest in the audience. I'm 62. The real reason history can be rewritten today, making the NAZI's funny. harmless, boobs rather than the vicious evil characters that there was nothing funny about is because most of the ""Greatest generation"" are now elderly or dead."
tL4McUzXfFI,oh yea legend has it my dad killed hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,That’s terrible 😂 it’s literally starring hitter
tL4McUzXfFI,Where's Strohiem?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie doesnt come out until January 2020 for my country, why do I have to wait so long!?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing.... I smell a masterpiece...
tL4McUzXfFI,New Simon Pegg and Nick Frost?
tL4McUzXfFI,I really have mixed feelings about this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,THEY ADDED THE REGULAR SHOW FINALE MUSIC IM WATCHING IT
tL4McUzXfFI,Watch this get canceled 😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Jewish Jesse Owens jack the ripper
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks like a gas. . . .



Oh wait.."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was awesome.
tL4McUzXfFI,"The last time a nazi was with a jojo, they summoned the ultimate life form and sent it to space"
tL4McUzXfFI,"*YouTube* : no nazis in videos!

*this*"
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone know where I can find a clip of 1:53?
tL4McUzXfFI,I would say this is a cool movie but the way they portray Hitler... I mean he's fricken HITLER and they're portraying him as a quirky Dopey character yet he killed millions of people. I just think it's a horrible decision on the director's part.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I just got back from watching this movie, I don’t normally cry during movies, especially near random people.
But this movie fucking destroyed me."
tL4McUzXfFI,"The Disneyification of Nazis. A really horrible story of making Hitler a Disney Character. Tries to make Gestapo look like cute bumblers instead of sadistic assholes. If you liked Mel Brook's ""Springtime For Hitler"", you'll like this crap."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is very racist against Germans. The war ended a long time ago. Disney can just knock off their race baiting bullshit
tL4McUzXfFI,OH SO THIS IS WHAT IS YOUTUBE TOLERATES
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's Bizarre Adventure! His stand? Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a good movie to watch with the family during Hanukkah
tL4McUzXfFI,Ho!y schise
tL4McUzXfFI,I loved this film♥️♥️♥️
tL4McUzXfFI,Literally jewish propaganda hahahahahahahaha
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was hilarious
tL4McUzXfFI,Can’t wait to see what kind of bs is coming out of this
tL4McUzXfFI,"Lol I don’t know why but I laughed at the part where the dude says ""And blowing stuff up"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Bo Burnham was right:”All tragedy will be joked about”
tL4McUzXfFI,can't wait for the Marvel Third Reich cinematic universe
tL4McUzXfFI,I hate nazis so just why
tL4McUzXfFI,"What is this
Why is this"
tL4McUzXfFI,"How did fox get qway with this, being ruled by the mouse now."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow part 9 looks awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,The Live action spin off how how Strohiem Convinced Joseph to become a Nazi.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wes Anderson wants his style back
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just saw it.. No spoilers. 

Great movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ok, I'm going to rant for a minute. Does anyone else find that its BS can do just about anything involving Nazis and no one bats an eye? Games are literally forced to change history in order to accommodate for people who are so frail that they cant handle literal history but movies can glorify Nazis by adding zany characters and crappy comedy. ""Haha look at Hanz, he shoved a jew into a room he farted in. Gives a whole new meaning to 'gas the jews' am I right?"" God forbid we portray history how it actually happened in an Interactive way just because ""bad things make me sad"". Its not like it was a very happy place in the first place. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Captain K was the best character,  change my mind"
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo more like JewJew
tL4McUzXfFI,Vou prosesar

tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is giving life to nazis!?!? That's horrible this is not a good movie at all I'm never going to even consider watching another clip of this
tL4McUzXfFI,Not a good place or time for this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,The predominant theme in this movie is that Epstein did not kill himself.
tL4McUzXfFI,Do you recommend this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,Bad day
tL4McUzXfFI,Shit's gonna be lit!
tL4McUzXfFI,Now this just puts a whole new meaning to *THEY'RE IN THE ATTIC*
tL4McUzXfFI,THIS TRAILER IS THE FINEST THING IS THE WORLD! (Tell me yall got that)
tL4McUzXfFI,is this seriously a comedy about the Holocaust
tL4McUzXfFI,I'M A BELIEVER IN GERMAN I'M SCREAMING

tL4McUzXfFI,"""It's time to burn some books!!""
Kids: *happiness noises*"
tL4McUzXfFI,That song brings me back to the finale of regular show
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow the sequel to The Greatest Story Never Told really took a strange turn
tL4McUzXfFI,I wanna watch this I don’t like hitler but the concept is funny and it is like a family friendly movie so many people will judge it just because of hitler but they need to understand that it is just a funny movie not a full one massacre movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Director: You got the part! Guy: Really? Which one?"" Director: ""Hitler"""
tL4McUzXfFI,This move is offensive as a Jewish family surviving WWII. More of a mockery than a movie.  WOW STOOPED LOW Like Donald Trump
tL4McUzXfFI,The edgy 15 year olds are going crazy for this
tL4McUzXfFI,THE FUCKIN INTRO OWHH GAWD
tL4McUzXfFI,FOOL  THE GERMAN MOVIES ARE THE BEST ON THE WORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,Best movie of the year for me. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Some really dark jokes in there lmao
tL4McUzXfFI,idk i love dark humor but maybe we shouldn’t be making light of the holocaust... hot take ik

tL4McUzXfFI,I'm President Trump of the United States that I just have to say what what the hell is this I thought this was supposed to be a Disney movie what the heck is this you have JoJo over here burning down the house or should I say Hitler Burning Down the House can blame it on Hulu who the hell that was forgot his name this is.

tL4McUzXfFI,I need to split explained this to you but it is crack that if you so don't the rabbit you cray cray OK Google you could go to jail I mean kid Google
tL4McUzXfFI,All I know is that this trailer keeps popping up as in ad on YouTube. Please go away.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Okay everybody, welcome to your new class today we're going to learn about War War 2 what happened in Germany in World War II a kid says he kids oh I got an idea of what about JoJo rabbit how dumb are you"
tL4McUzXfFI,That german version of heros though...

tL4McUzXfFI,undercover nazi lover. may Hitler continue to burn in hell
tL4McUzXfFI,"Smh, they leaked Part 9"
tL4McUzXfFI,I probably feels disrespectful for vets their trying to making humor out a terrible war that many people died in
tL4McUzXfFI,1:32  when you spot the beans
tL4McUzXfFI,What's the original of the song at the end of the trailer? Please someone answer
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to see this movie.  I don't say that about the majority that come out.
tL4McUzXfFI,Are we the baddies?
tL4McUzXfFI,the JoJo jokes in the comments suck so hard.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm sorry but I don't understand what the message of the story or movie is💀 people find this funny but I don't find a man who killed millions of innocent adults and children entertaining. Even if the movie is not meant to be that way, why did they chose a man who brought fear, sadness, and pain to a lot of people? Yes I get it you guys are running out of ideas but why couldn't you guys make him into Leonard da vanci or Vincent van goh but this is just💀 what will we have next? Anne frank in Hollywood"
tL4McUzXfFI,"A comedy involving Stalin ✅
A comedy involving Hitler ✅








What's next, a comedy involving Mao???????"
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Definitely not a good time to be a nazi"" lol"
tL4McUzXfFI,"We should go back to this movie in a Nazi symbol so that waititi falls over, it would be so funny"
tL4McUzXfFI,"A very good movie.
It explores the human spirit through a child with humor.

Mel Brooks would be very happy with this movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't know how much the movie company paid YouTube for commercials but Im seeing its commercials every 5-10 minutes. It is getting very very very annoying to watch this trailer over and over again. Plus, I did not think it was interesting at all. I just felt like this film tried too hard to advertise itself. I don't know about the quality of the movie, but I hope it is not disappointing. 👎🏻"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I see Hitler I click

tL4McUzXfFI,I hear the libtards crying over this already😂🇺🇸
tL4McUzXfFI,"Okay so now Hollywood is normalizing Nazi’s and genocide, White people are going to love this smdh I hate the people in America sometimes"
tL4McUzXfFI,is it me or they want us to sympathize with hitler??? It’s a big no from me
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THAT A JOJO REFERANCE?!

tL4McUzXfFI,"A movie about nazis coming out from FOX...

tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m surprised hitler hasn’t killed her yet, I’m mean back then it was shoot to kill"
tL4McUzXfFI,"My mom just says “any movie with Hitler disgusts me”
I murmured under my breath *ok boomer*"
tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t be the only one who’s deeply confused on why this keeps showing on my Snapchat as an ad

tL4McUzXfFI,*looks in part Jewish*
tL4McUzXfFI,"I live in white trash shithole and this movie along with other non pro American ones didn’t play at my theater and really wished they did, I literally have to make a 4 hour drive back and fourth to see this and another but just didn’t want to and now I regret it"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I got this as an ad just today from Youtube. Tbh, I'm really surprised there isn't controversy over Youtube showing this as an ad on their platform. Like wth."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks dumb
tL4McUzXfFI,So is this a nazi movie
tL4McUzXfFI,A satire in 2019? Thanos: impossible
tL4McUzXfFI,Way to make youth think Hitler is quirky and fun... jesus wtf?
tL4McUzXfFI,1:07 regular show
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks funny and Hitler being used very well.

Might want to see this."
tL4McUzXfFI,So... No one's gonna call this movie racist for not including black people 😎
tL4McUzXfFI,Leave it f'ed Hollywood to make Hilter/Nazis/wwII/etc etc something cute.  Hope this movie falls flat on its face.  Sick bastards ALL.

tL4McUzXfFI,Lmao
tL4McUzXfFI,"Any Jews are ok with THIS??? I'm not going to lie, I'll be a little ticked off if I was a Jew!"
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder when they are going to do a satirical comedy about 9/11
tL4McUzXfFI,"Alright, this trailer has me divided."
tL4McUzXfFI,I kind of understand what this movies about it shows what hitler youth kids thought what they were getting into but then realized what it actually was that is just my theory
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that th girl from avengers
tL4McUzXfFI,"Man things must be great back then
You get to be a soldier when your 11"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Dear God
This made me laugh so much but I just have one question
WHY?
XD"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is quite a bizarre movie cause we are all used to antagonizing hitler because his goal was to enslave the earth but seeing him as an imaginary friend? This is wild
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo. JoJo everywhere I see
tL4McUzXfFI,"Auf der Heide blüht ein kleines Blümelein

Zarter Duft entströmt dem Blütenkleid
Auf der Heide blü ein kleines Blümelein
Und das heißt:
Erika.

In mein'm Kämmerlein blüht auch ein Blümelein
Und das heißt:
Erika. 
Schon beim Morgengrau'n sowie beim Dammerschein
Schaut's mich an,

tL4McUzXfFI,I’m very pissed. The fact that they make jokes about jewish people makes me mad 😡🤬
tL4McUzXfFI,Director of Bore Ragnarok huh?
tL4McUzXfFI,Mon the Brits
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks funny af lol.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Get it? He’s cute, but a Nazi! Nazis aren’t cute! HAHAHAHA"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is extremely distasteful. Glorifying nazis and what they did during the Holocaust? This is propaganda. Hitter or ANY NAZI or ANYONE who puts on the uniform shouldn’t  be shown in a positive light at all.
tL4McUzXfFI,I like it because it’s putting comedy on a bad situation
tL4McUzXfFI,"I wonder how many people are gonna be so offended after finding out there is a Nazi camp movie comedy.

6 million people at total??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
tL4McUzXfFI,What have we become??????

film and it's satire."

My sis: WAIT A JOJO SIWA MOVIE!?!?!?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"So why are we playing down the roles of nazis and turning them into adorned movie characters? Comedies reflect positive emotion, there should be no positive emotion towards nazis nor Hitler.. just a 20 year old speaking his piece.. continue"

tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo’s bizarre adventure: Part 9

tL4McUzXfFI,German science is the best in the world!
tL4McUzXfFI,I would go see it but I can't since it's not in any theaters near me I wish I would stop getting ads for it since I can't see it anyway I want to support Taika Waititi's work because I know it's golden but I can't please release this to a broader range of theaters
tL4McUzXfFI,"Watched it, liked it. It's actually more about a kid growing up and face the real life.WWII and Hitler are merely elements in it.If you are looking for a ""epic, tear jerking WWII movie"" then this is definitely not the one."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I just watched this movie worth the 50 min drive to go see it. Great story, great acting, looks beautiful while watching which was a goal the director had, and the music fit perfectly. 10/10"

Producer: ok
Writer: but it’s from the nazis side
Producer: ok?
Writer: and the main character is a kid and hitler is painted as an idiot
Producer: are you ok?
Writer:"
tL4McUzXfFI,I DID NAZI DIS CUMMING!! OOOOOOoooo. Tee hee   (ﾉ≧ڡ≦)
tL4McUzXfFI,There's a miniature Nick Frost in the movie at the 2:07 mark. Could not stop seeing it that way.
tL4McUzXfFI,Pleasant surprise. Added to must see list of interesting films.
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a Stroheim backstory
tL4McUzXfFI,No fair it comes out January 10th in my country☹️☹️
tL4McUzXfFI,I prefer propaganda to be a little more subtle than this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Who the hell at Fox thought this was a good idea? Nazis are not funny. They can never be funny. They are terrifying monsters. This movie should never have been conceived. I hope whomever thought of it got fired, because they clearly have some Nazi affiliations of their own. Anyone who understood the history would not have green-lighted this."
tL4McUzXfFI,You utter fool!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,2:01
tL4McUzXfFI,I feel like it's form over substance with this director's work. Hope this one changes my mind.
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi's can be nice too
tL4McUzXfFI,This piece of crap should never had happened.  A bunch of kids following an imaginary psychopath killer. Why #fox is making it acceptable. There's nothing good or funny involving nazis and communists. Is completely disgusting and disrespectful towards billions of people who suffered because of hitlers commands.
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THAT A FUCKING JOJO REFERENCE?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Cant you see people? Its directed by Wes Anderson!, orange color palette, kids rule, kid camp, war history, men are less dominant, kids romance.."
tL4McUzXfFI,Trash...more of the same.
tL4McUzXfFI,A funny yet poignant satirical take on a horrible chapter in history. All through the eyes of a ten year old boy who has been taught to hate. Hands down one of my favorite movies this year. Cried three times!
tL4McUzXfFI,"So this is Boy in the Striped Pyjamas if it were directed by Wes Anderson...




*I love it*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Such a clever way to use humour to explain the absurdity of racism. Definitely watching this. 
Edit:Woop! Thanks for the likes lol."
tL4McUzXfFI,PG family friendly movie is actually going in with a nazi symbols than a video game. (CoD ww2 and BFV)
tL4McUzXfFI,"The fact that hes no longer against the jude is quite sad man, not based 0/10"

tL4McUzXfFI,So where are the stands?
tL4McUzXfFI,Moonrise Kingdom: Hitler Jugend Edition
tL4McUzXfFI,"Saw it at the theater in Minneapolis with the Marque proudly announcing ""Directed by Korg."" - Fantastic film. It may be  comedy, but it pulls no punches. Surprised it managed a PG-13 though."
tL4McUzXfFI,The producers  made something so brave yet so controversial
tL4McUzXfFI,This caused what happened on the news about a school
tL4McUzXfFI,Aw. This actually helps me to deal with the thought of that war.

tL4McUzXfFI,0% of the audience for this movie will be Jewish.

tL4McUzXfFI,What is the second song?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Not funny 
People are becoming brainwashed"
tL4McUzXfFI,I just saw it.  Most over-rated movie of the year.  Audience prize at TIFF?  Everyone must have been stoned.  Just an overly long Monty Python skit.  How about a back story?  When did JoJo start having his Hitler hallucinations?  How did his sister die?  How about consistent German accents?  Underwhelmed by Taika's over the top acting.  Why does my computer think JoJo and Taika are misspellings?  Sleep easy Quentin.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just change the title to YouTube, Google, Facebook, and Twitter make a movie... And then it's no longer satire"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Taika i'm sorry but this is going to destroy your career. These PC idiots are the real nazis and can't tell satire from a panzerschreck. They're just gonna rip it apart as ""anti-cultural"" garbage and send you to the proverbial gulag. I'm sorry but calling it right now."

tL4McUzXfFI,"Just saw the movie today, (finally), it's a slow roll out and I understand it will be in all theaters next weekend. LOVED IT! I've also read the book ""Caging Skies"". LOVED IT! Make sure you do both as well, it doesn't matter which you do first, one doesn't spoil the other, each stands on it's owns merits."
tL4McUzXfFI,Imagine being friends with literally hitler i wonder how many people are offended by this
tL4McUzXfFI,Some people are just to much of a sheep to understand the message of love that comedy can deliver. Well done Taika Waititi !
tL4McUzXfFI,Just saw it today. Best movie I have seen in a really long time.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Who exactly is the audience here?

tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo's mom is so beautiful. I have a crush on her
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the Alternate Universe where Stroheim is a Joestar.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, looks like this kid has gone through a really bizarre adventure"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Is it making fun of Nazis 
Or embracing them??"

tL4McUzXfFI,There aren't enough parentheses in the world for this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"A Dio and Jojo rabbit team up would make then unstoppable, i mean you got a literal time stopping vampire, and hitler. What more could you ask for?"
tL4McUzXfFI,And at the end of the movie we figure out Hitler was following him around the whole time actually talking to him
tL4McUzXfFI,"It’s right there in plain view. I don’t know why this guy wants to make this movie, but it is not good for any children to watch. Examples: it’s time to burn some books and then all the children cheer. Then the lady gives the child affirmation, you are our best something. Not good for a child wanting affirmation to see serving nazi people he will get it. Then children are seen throwing petrol bombs, launching weapons at building, all these things are not good for children to take in their minds. No matter what they say about a happy ending, their is some evil purpose for this movie. An eleven year old salutes for service. Not good for children seeking to belong. A white woman recently reported she needs to watch her white sons use of Instagram because nazi influences were affecting the young boy. You think it’s innocent, it can’t be. That’s what they want you to think and then they create this trash that we are better off without. Parents, pray for your children. And parents if you don’t believe in God, ask Him to prove he is in your life trying to help you."

Lost her entire family and and watcher her father  get shot to death at the age of 5 would not think this is funny?!?!?
Imagine if this was a satire about slavery? No one would stand for it... this is actually not okay. Watch schindlers list and then tell me if this movie is funny to you.... 
I cannot believe how prominent anti-semitism is.
Hitler and the holocaust is not funny and will never be funny..."

tL4McUzXfFI,Story aside (which is great) the performances from all the actors/actresses are phenomenal. I wish Alfie Allen had a bigger role in the movie but him and Sam Rockwell did a fantastic job. Definitely a movie everyone should see and have their own opinions instead of resorting to audience and critic responses to paint the story.
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was god awful. Seriously I want my money back.

tL4McUzXfFI,"With the political left -- given its current temperature -- who are trying to ever-so-covertly turn America into a giant communist state, if but by one socialist-lite step at a time, you have to ask yourself if want them exposing your children to the ""goofy"" side of nazism? And while the role for Hitler was cast as open, not one actor in all the industry wanted it -- not even renowned racist Mel Gibson! So Producer/Writer/Actor/Comedian Taika David Waititi-Cohen, even though he professes to hating Hitler, had to do it himself. He's talented, you have to give him that. But that's no excuse. Some subjects should forever be taboo, and making light of what Hitler did to the Jews should forever be one of them. There's nothing funny about mass murder, even if only satirical. Or are you getting your chuckle on, as Syrians die by the thousands? No one I know ever tried to make funny about Eva Braun and Adolph Hitler having sex on a a sofa made of the faces they killed, as lit by lampshades made from the backs of human skin as purposely tattooed to enhance their beauty: no one. I thank you in advance for all the thumbs down, because at least that let's me know I'm on the right track. The rest of you bitches only like it for its truth. Now that's, satirical."

tL4McUzXfFI,Now that's the successor to Bruno Ganz.
tL4McUzXfFI,I imagine that's how many americans actually see german history

tL4McUzXfFI,"Son: Mother can I watch a movie about a kid who has a imaginary friend called hetler.

Mother: Ummm....."
tL4McUzXfFI,AND I SAW HER FACE IM A BELEIVER
tL4McUzXfFI,I freaked out when I heard David Bowie’s Heros/Helden
tL4McUzXfFI,jojo's bizzare adventure looks a little different than i remember
tL4McUzXfFI,"it was about recovering from the travesty of a the great war 
antisemitism was mostly fueled by fools and California TOOL$, climate change 2_|_oo ENVIRONmENTALLY screwed ,Plymouth rock jaded Bowie"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie was good on so many levels.  It was a comedy with some serious heart.  It’s not on wide release in my area so I had to seek it out.  Everyone else should do the same.
tL4McUzXfFI,"”It's definitely not a good time to be a Nazi”
*Laughs in Nuremberg Trials”"
tL4McUzXfFI,*based on a true story*
tL4McUzXfFI,Germany in a nutshell
tL4McUzXfFI,It looks spectacular
tL4McUzXfFI,Promoting socialism to the youth kids are easily manipulated.cant beive they even allowed this shit total disrepect to the men and women who died fighting them murderous fks....wowwwww
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to see this but no one is playing it 😭
tL4McUzXfFI,"this movie should just be called ""boy who is casual friends with hitler develops a crush on a jewish girl"""
tL4McUzXfFI,German engineering truly is the best!
tL4McUzXfFI,What is this movie suppose to be about
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler"" My sides, they are gone."
tL4McUzXfFI,". .
— wut"
tL4McUzXfFI,😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"never thought i'd see hitler, romanoff, and a stand user all in one movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I fear that this comment section is filled with ""JoJoke Ora Nuts""."
tL4McUzXfFI,Course fox made this who else would lol
tL4McUzXfFI,“I’ve got it! Burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill! I mean negotiate!”
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I actually want to watch this?
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m absolutely confused
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally Stroheim's backstory.
tL4McUzXfFI,"“So how about we make a comedy movie, now wait get this, about one of the largest genocides in history!” 

“.. Dude that’s terrible. I know we are a huge company but we can’t just do anything we want bro.”

“No, it’ll be fine I promise! We can get Scarlett Johansson on board?”

“oh shit why didn’t you say so what’s up then”"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hollywood stands bravely against the long dead Nazi regime but is silent about what China is CURRENTLY doing. $$$$
tL4McUzXfFI,"Insert whiney. woke bullshit, twitter nerd comment"
tL4McUzXfFI,This already looks iconic
tL4McUzXfFI,HOI4 Scraping the barrel be like
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m just in the comments to ask what the name of the songs are. What are the names of the songs?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm sorry but, I wont watch a movie where Hitler becomes your family friend."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I have a very elderly Dutch friend who watched the Luftwaffe bomb Rotterdam, and told me what the Germans did afterwards. I won't be sending the link to this film trailer."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie... I can't even.....You have got to see this. Thank you Takia Waititi.
tL4McUzXfFI,"So having seen the movie now, I can say with certainty it is the best ""anti-Nazi"" movie I've seen in some time. Nothing like what you're expecting. Went with my Jewish neighbor who went a second time and took her husband. Funny, moving, thought provoking, unexpected."
tL4McUzXfFI,Jo Jo Rabbit
tL4McUzXfFI,"Honey, there's jews in the attic again!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Nice movie
tL4McUzXfFI,So is Von Stroheim in this?

tL4McUzXfFI,"STAND NAME:  「ADOLF HITLER」
STAND MASTER: JoJo"
tL4McUzXfFI,"What a bad idea for a movie. These wounds drive deeper than a lot understand and many do. To make a movie like this is the worse idea in the world. Lakes make a comedy about geniside.. I am sure there is some spin on this movie were someone decides Jewish people are not bad and that is the moral of the story. That is what school is for, like history class. BAD TASTE. I feel sorry for the younger children playing parts in this movies who don't know at all what they are playing or what it represents. The adults actors, directors anyone who made this movies possible, should never work in motion pictures again.. Sure they make movies about past war but mainly not comedy and not by children."
tL4McUzXfFI,I never thought this would be possible. Im not creative enough
tL4McUzXfFI,"""a jew?"" “gesundheit  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)”"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Outstanding, highly recommend it, you will never forget this movie.  I love reading about war and studying it, but it certainly ruins many lives."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Of course, the standard yearly Holocaustianity film"
tL4McUzXfFI,Amazing movie..just saw it 10/10
tL4McUzXfFI,The fact a half Jew/half aborigine is playing Hitler does bring a smile to my face
tL4McUzXfFI,"The real question is


Why did the directors make a kid apart of a nazi movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,I like this. I'm need to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,"What a great time to be alive, when you can laugh about Nazis and Fuhrer in the 21st century. A movie for the entire European family."
tL4McUzXfFI,"""I searched for Jojo on Google and I saw this""


I did Nazi that coming 

Credits to the guy who made the first part of this joke"
tL4McUzXfFI,"no body 
not a single soul 
not even a single creature
taika watiti lets make the weirdest movie of hitler"
tL4McUzXfFI,Making Mel Brooks proud! 😊
tL4McUzXfFI,I heard the bit where they turn jews into soap and put the boys through masturbation machines is based on reality. Can anybody whose seen the movie verify this as i'm planning on taking my jewish nephew to the cinemas but I will not stand for flagrant anti-semitism.
tL4McUzXfFI,2019 is a surprisingly good year for movies
tL4McUzXfFI,"You know, it's nice that people can watch this movie and think that Nazis and Hitler weren't so bad."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a comedy with hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I did Nazi this coming.
tL4McUzXfFI,Does anyone else think this is glorifying the Holocaust
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is funny and enjoyable but has a larger picture behind each scenes
tL4McUzXfFI,Good grief
tL4McUzXfFI,It's definitely not a good time to make this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Showed this to my Grandpa and he was like: 

«Ahh, the nostalgia»"
tL4McUzXfFI,When your stand has a mind of its own
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m so confused.
tL4McUzXfFI,Think of all the poor girls looking for Jojo Siwa videos that end up watching this beautiful trailer instead.
tL4McUzXfFI,There was the regular show ending song :C
tL4McUzXfFI,They somehow made a movie set in Nazi Germany look lighthearted
tL4McUzXfFI,"Not gonna lie but as a German speaker, I hate this kind of films not because of Hitler or world war 2 but because of the accent. I cringe every time."
tL4McUzXfFI,HAIL HYDRA!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,SHREK
tL4McUzXfFI,Guys is this a JoJo's reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,So the boy was talking to the wall this whole time.
tL4McUzXfFI,💓💞
tL4McUzXfFI,You expected a JoJo reference but it’s me! Adolf Hitler!
tL4McUzXfFI,"People thinking disney hates this
But Walt Disney hated jews lmao"
tL4McUzXfFI,Can’t wait to see this.
tL4McUzXfFI,Meh it would be better movie without the Hitler youth kid falling in love with little jewish girl.
tL4McUzXfFI,I have to say these jojokes are fuckin awesome considering I dont really care about jojos bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,I gotta watch this holy shit
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don’t know what to think, say or write right now........"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I really don’t like this movie idea. Not because it’s nazis, I don’t care about that at all. The thing that bothers me is the fact that the movie makes it seem like the children were actually children in Germany. The kids were sent to camps to become emotionless soldiers. A group of the children were captured later in the war by US troops and they reported that the kids had no fear nor emotion. The country completely brainwashed its youth and I really don’t like the lightening up of the subject. I think that everything that happened in world war 2 should never be taken lightest or take comedically because it makes us forget what really happened. This is a step to forgetting and I really don’t like it."
tL4McUzXfFI,Now every in history class when learning about ww2 be like - JuSt liKE j0JO RabBiT!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,what is the name of the second song
tL4McUzXfFI,Let’s whole no one is Jewish
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm waiting for Taika Waititi & Quentin Tarantino to seriously collaborate on a movie together.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a spin off of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency?!
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo rabbit in france is brer rabbit.
tL4McUzXfFI,OMG I need to see that clip where he is jumping over the logs LOL!!
tL4McUzXfFI,What was going on through the producers minds???
tL4McUzXfFI,The Black Widow movie has turned into something I didn't expect.
tL4McUzXfFI,...is it bad if I want to watch it? Is it bad???
tL4McUzXfFI,As a jew i don’t like this
tL4McUzXfFI,plot twist that kid is actualy the main jojo of part 9
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oct 25 2019

tL4McUzXfFI,What?!  Does Fox have any shame?!
tL4McUzXfFI,"8 k hate the movie cus its jojo , and miss leading"
tL4McUzXfFI,"WTF, this movie was made for me!"

tL4McUzXfFI,"The kid in this movie must be like: ""are we the baddies?"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Yeah let's romanticize Facism. What's the worst that could happen
tL4McUzXfFI,"Brilliant cinema.  Finally a movie that makes you laugh, cry and think.  Saw it last night and loved it."
tL4McUzXfFI,oh my god this is so cute

tL4McUzXfFI,This is definitely NOT the 2004 pop sensation JoJo I was looking for...
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it still kind of bad to say that i actually kinda love the Adolf Hitler of this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Didn’t see Mel Brooks cameo ....
tL4McUzXfFI,looks good.
tL4McUzXfFI,Why did Hitler commit suicide? Because he saw the gas bill.
tL4McUzXfFI,Since when is Wes Anderson a Nazi
tL4McUzXfFI,Darn good film. Made me laugh and ... other stuff.
tL4McUzXfFI,this feels like a Mel Brooks movie.

Many died in both and in United States Hollywood make movies about slavery and the poor people who died in that era on the hands of whites. No one says anything about that. JoJo Rabbit is just History and satire/dark humor movie. People so sensitive now days. Learn to forgive, but not forget!. I can't wait to watch this movie. 4 tickets for me please."

tL4McUzXfFI,I was in the movie theater with my friends when the trailer for this popped up and we started laughing at just how ridiculous and funny it was and I found it more due to actually knowing history about WWII myself. Upon looking this up the idea seems pretty decent and wouldn't mind to go see it. Lets just hope the media doesn't take down the movie.

tL4McUzXfFI,"One word




*Wolfenstein*"
tL4McUzXfFI,WHERE IS STROHEIM
tL4McUzXfFI,The way they changed Hitler into a satirical character expresses the problem with current society. This movie is ridiculous. I can’t believe people think this is okay. 🤦🏽‍♀️
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow I wonder who this got on my recommendations eather the Germans are trying to recruit us or the fact this thing is PG 13
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait for Scarlett Johanson to play a tree...

Read into that exactly what is obvious about it"
tL4McUzXfFI,My stand name: hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I love movies about hitlar
tL4McUzXfFI,This is in extremely bad taste. Making humor out of a devastating historical event. While they're at it why dont they make a 9/11 comedy as well. Sick. Dumbasses
tL4McUzXfFI,There aren’t any black actors Ik this is in nazi Germany but it’s a movie y not included any?
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone watched it yet? I did :D
tL4McUzXfFI,"Me: *sees this trailer*

tL4McUzXfFI,Man part 9 looks sick!
tL4McUzXfFI,"I look forward to how irate this film will make those white supremacists and Nazi groups, especially having Waititi as their beloved Hitler😂😂😂. There was another comedy about Hitler returning to this time period and seeing how everything is in Germany and interviews random German citizens."

tL4McUzXfFI,Nice movie trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,as a historically buffed person. i found this movie a hilariously very slapstick ww2 satire.
tL4McUzXfFI,When Von Strohheim writes fanfiction
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn, I wish boy scouts was like that to an extent"
tL4McUzXfFI,Where is the giant angry mob? All I see in the comments are jokes 'n stuff...

tL4McUzXfFI,"Me:watches video

Me after the the video ends:Wth did I just watch"
tL4McUzXfFI,The twisted ending the girls ann frank. I dont know if she is but that would be one hell of a twisted ending
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm guessing that this and Hogan's Heroes are a shared universe … hey, a movie that shows the zanier side of Nazi Germany"
tL4McUzXfFI,Ждём русскоязычную версию.
tL4McUzXfFI,This isn't a real movie right?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Producer; Pairing up ten years old boy with older teen girl is TIGHT.
Writer; Sir, that sounds really wrong
Producer; Yeah, that came out really wrong
Writer; Whoops
Producer; Whoopsie."
tL4McUzXfFI,*When theres Bowie singing Heroes in German you know its gonna be good*

tL4McUzXfFI,Where's Stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t wait to come back here in 10 years to see a bunch of smooth brains comment “couldn’t make a movie like this now a days”
tL4McUzXfFI,What a great way for Disney to indoctrinate Nazism to kids these days! The Nazi's were the greatest exterminators of human life on the planet! Nothing funny about that!
tL4McUzXfFI,I would  definitely  watch  this  dark comedy
tL4McUzXfFI,A must see movie...
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika's movies have all been great and this one looks no different
tL4McUzXfFI,"Confirmed, the stand of stroheim is hitler"
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok black people. This film here is a personal challenge to us. Let's see who can be more un-offended lol. Let's commission Spike Lee to satirize the Jim Crow era.
tL4McUzXfFI,looks like a jew director 've smoked some bohd
tL4McUzXfFI,I think the boy with the thick rimmed glasses would make a good Russel if they made an up movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Another side to the minority ruling it's majority..Brilliant.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I wanted to read the ""Caging Skies"" before I watched the movie, I did, I just finished it today. Now I'm not sure if I can watch the movie. Christine Leunens just wrenched my soul like a wet dirty rag and threw it out on the counter to fend for itself. Now I wish I'd done the reverse, watched the movie first then read the book."
tL4McUzXfFI,Why didnt the producers use real child Nazis in the making of this film? Boycott!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"wait did Imaginary Hitler say ,""Burn down the house and blame Churchill.""?"
tL4McUzXfFI,It makes me cringe to even watch it...awful scenario when so many people suffered through these dire years!
tL4McUzXfFI,My favorite anime is now Live Action.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Why is the history so drunk at night 

Now their including anime in their documentary"

tL4McUzXfFI,Ugh I wanted to see this movie for so long but it’s not even playing In my town AHHH
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder what would have happened if WW2 never happened
tL4McUzXfFI,"OMG!  It's just like Nazi Fox to make a ""comedy"" about Nazis!  This is horrifying!  Destroy this piece of crap!  There is ""NOTHING"" funny about them or that time period!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks pretty dumb.
tL4McUzXfFI,Sam Rockwell's in? I'm watching it.
tL4McUzXfFI,The actors and ppl involved with the movie are telling you what they support without actually saying it
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo mama
tL4McUzXfFI,"Noisy, slickly edited trailers, the purpose of which is to lure me into a theater full of ignorant, social media-addled morons, always has the opposite result on me. If it isn't an improvement on what Mel Brooks did 52 years ago, I'll save my money."
tL4McUzXfFI,Stando power! Iron Erika!
tL4McUzXfFI,"I can't wait for a movie about Communism and I really hope it glorifies the 820 millions dead citizens they starved to death and slaughtered like animals, see how the left sticks to their Bolshevik agenda!"
tL4McUzXfFI,You are now entering...the BONE ZONE!
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't know why this reminds me of Inglorious Basterds.

tL4McUzXfFI,Seriously they are making light of this horrible tragedy..and having Hitler as comedic relief? Wth haha
tL4McUzXfFI,I cant believe Stroheim named his child after JoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,"Read Tanya Savicheva Diary. 
That pupil died during 4 years of Leningrad siege in 1944 . All her family died and she wrote it in her diary all those horror events with last efforts to survive a hunger and cold. That mass-maniac ordered to erase the city of Leningrad . If people surrender , they would have taken to concentration camps. Future generation should know the truth instead of such degradation movies.

tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a movie that isn’t politically correct and makes fun of Nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,"The Jews who own and run Hollywood certainly have a Nazi fetish.  Nazis are the focus of at least 4-5 major films, every year, along with countless references in other films and television programming.  I get-it that the victor writes history and all, but this is getting a little bit cringe."
tL4McUzXfFI,I love how this showed up after a holocaust video

tL4McUzXfFI,When did jojos stand become purple haze
tL4McUzXfFI,Didn't expect Part 9 to go in this direction.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is trash.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jew makes comedy abot nazi, hm"
tL4McUzXfFI,"the dumbest thing I've ever seen, and no wonder because Hollywood is not only bereft of ideas, they bereft of making intelligent choices. Waititi is not funny, Ragnarok was sophomoric."
tL4McUzXfFI,"**drops panzershrek**
Storm troopers: ** frightened screaming**"
tL4McUzXfFI,From the guy who brought us What we do in the sshadows. This is going to be hilarious AF.
tL4McUzXfFI,"See's Jojo in the title
𝙔𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙔𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝘿𝙖𝙯𝙚"
tL4McUzXfFI,So can we expect this movie to be just as shitty as Thor Ragnarok?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Basically rebooted Anne Frank with people making JoJo's Bizarre Adventures references.




Chane my mind."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Movie about Hitler:  No outcry from media.  

Movie about Joker: ""This movie is for Trump supporters who are LITERALLY NAZIS?!"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ahhh. Remember these are the same Nazi the Americans bombed by day, the British by night. And then The Soviet Bolshevik J---, (ahem) unlease hoards of Asiatic Mongoloids men to kill and Rape the remaining German population. Ah the good old days."
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,The origin of Rudol Von Stroheim
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN ZAWORLDO!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, not a Nazi but German film for the whole German family and their feeling that nothing happened, have fun descendants of thieves and murderers"
tL4McUzXfFI,"They said this is a bizzare adventure.


This is beyond bizzare!"
tL4McUzXfFI,What is the song
tL4McUzXfFI,"I really think overall this movie will not do well. Personally I do not think WW2 movies should try to be funny, maybe a few were able to pull it off (the great escape etc.) but really such a deadly moment in history shouldn’t be portrayed as anything but what it was- horrific."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Did you know that famous book burning was all literature from the last twenty years of Satanic garbage that was projected into the minds of Germans by Occultists? Berlin was the most Satanic city in the world for over 20 years which lead to Hitler who was almost as Satanic as the puppets before him.


Its all Qlippothic Kabbalists in control of Rome, Mecca, and Jerusalem which in turn controls, New York, London, and Tokyo"
tL4McUzXfFI,Does anyone know the name of the last song they play in the trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, its about time! A film about the good guys..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't remember this in battle tendency.
tL4McUzXfFI,*Excellent*
tL4McUzXfFI,"iS tHiS a jOjO rEfEReNcE?¿





-no harm no foul btw just jokes"
tL4McUzXfFI,"The sensonlisation of the villan, they use humor or glamour to make the worst people throughout history seem acceptable. Reminds me of that show Lucifer where they make Satan seem appealing. The sad thing is that society has become so wicked that people are actually proud of filth like this. I'm thankful that God has given us Jesus, and the ability to see this for what it is"
tL4McUzXfFI,Dude there is a juwish living inside the walls of your house... You gonna need to use gaz.
tL4McUzXfFI,German science is ze finest in ze vorld!
tL4McUzXfFI,Next they will make a movie about ICE
tL4McUzXfFI,"What

Another 
Kid"
tL4McUzXfFI,"What if instead of going back in time and killing Hitler, we swapped the Jews with jojo fans?"
tL4McUzXfFI,I can't tell if I either want to go see this or if I should be offended... How ever I'm not a German or a liberal so I'll probably go watch it
tL4McUzXfFI,JOJO and Hitler's bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,I really hope his mom doesn’t die. I have this bad feeling that she’s going to die and he’ll have to come to the conclusion of right and wrong on his own.
tL4McUzXfFI,That kid with galsses is cuter than kitten videos on YouTube !
tL4McUzXfFI,"Excuse me, what the actual fuck? I need to watch this."
tL4McUzXfFI,these new jojo parts keep getting crazier and crazier.
tL4McUzXfFI,not the JoJo Dancer sequel I was expecting
tL4McUzXfFI,This is kinda wholesome
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah from Shrek to the Nazi's, Smash Mouth are very international!"
tL4McUzXfFI,I spit out my Pepsi when I saw this as an add- I wanna watch it
tL4McUzXfFI,"""I wish more of our boys had your blind fanaticism."" If you're a Trump supporter, if you voted for Trump, if you wear a MAGA HAT, this is NOT something you'll find fun. For the rest of us seeking a coping mechanism in the madness...

L'Chaim!

#JoJoRabbit"
tL4McUzXfFI,Definitely not a good time to be an American
tL4McUzXfFI,This has to be the all time weirdest most bizarre movie ever made.
tL4McUzXfFI,What A Devil.
tL4McUzXfFI,"In this multiverse, Scarlett Johansson is with the Hydra."
tL4McUzXfFI,The nazis are coming!
tL4McUzXfFI,"*""sees name Jojo""*


Me: ZA WARDOOOOOO"
tL4McUzXfFI,I swear if von stroheim isn’t in this movie I will start the fourth reich
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a good 1945 JoJo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,wohooo scarlet
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope no one tries to say this movie is pro-Nazi. It's pretty clearly   made in complete mockery of them.
tL4McUzXfFI,I guess sacrilige is is now funny in hollywood.
tL4McUzXfFI,Don’t think FOX is going to be selling any merch for this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm waiting for the one person who thinks this is normalizing nazism and anti semitism.


I'm waiting dammit."
tL4McUzXfFI,So what hitler’s stand name?
tL4McUzXfFI,Came here for Jojo's bizarre adventure. Found Hitler screwing around.
tL4McUzXfFI,Pretty cool
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitlers stand shall b: Supreme Chamber!
tL4McUzXfFI,😂😂hitler said burn down the house and blame winston churchill
tL4McUzXfFI,It will hopefully be funny and make of the third rake.
tL4McUzXfFI,spin-off movie: Stroheim’s Bizarre Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, Disney approving Walt Disney Nazi propaganda."
tL4McUzXfFI,"hitler and his son, some of stroheim’s friends"
tL4McUzXfFI,this was a terribly out of touch and sincerely insulting film
tL4McUzXfFI,Uh......what?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hope that thia movie will bring about the day that I can hear somebody say, completely seriously
""I couldn't stop laughing when Hitler said, ........."""
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that scarlet johansen
tL4McUzXfFI,I like to believe there's an imaginary Hitler in all of us.
tL4McUzXfFI,I’ve been asking for a Nazi movie for years now!!
tL4McUzXfFI,I feel the West Anderson vibes
tL4McUzXfFI,This trailer is amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,"Is it me, or does the chubby kid with glasses look like a young Nick Frost?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"😞 I think you walk a dangerous line when you introduce Nazi culture in comedy...think of how many kids will be exposed to Nazi propaganda for the first time, and who might not be old enough to understand the depths of satire. 
I get what they’re trying to do here. 
But as someone who lost a whole chunk of their family tree thanks to the Nazis I say...NOT FUNNY."
tL4McUzXfFI,cool
tL4McUzXfFI,😠😠😠😠😠😠Who the. Hell. Made. This. Film.
tL4McUzXfFI,One of the selling points is the director of Thor?  I'll pass then.
tL4McUzXfFI,Cant wait for the SJW anger lol very amusing
tL4McUzXfFI,Yasssss more Nazi movies! *eye rolls
tL4McUzXfFI,........i ain't got the words😕😕😕
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi and Scarlett Johansson . looks good
tL4McUzXfFI,This is what Schindlers List originally was before all the rewrites.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stop with the NATASHA #AVENGER  afterlife comments already, She's doing something new, let's appreciate that first."
tL4McUzXfFI,So this Jojo has a stand called Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I feel like this will make me cry
I want to watch it"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yes but someone has to be triggered tough, im confused."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wheres van stroheim tough
tL4McUzXfFI,Who thought it would be a good idea to romanticize nazis?
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler is also my imaginary friend lol
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler: Hey, hey. Sit down.

Hitler: Now, listen. Can't have you talking to her about me.

Jojo: Why would I talk to her..

Hitler: You say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or to anybody, we're done.

Hitler: Now promise me.

Jojo: Okay.

Hitler: You Promise? 

Jojo: Yeah, I promise.

Hitler: Promise

Jojo: I just said I promise 

Hitler: That's  Drei times you promised."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is too close to offense to become comfortably funny. Not everything needs to made into a joke. Sure there is a foundation of some originality of character when it comes to ""jo jo"" references, but do we need to desentitize the horrors that happened. For example,  someone putting on ""black face"" and singing to kids ain't funny. But that's me. I won't watch it because what happened to the millions of jews shouldn't be presented to children ""maybe"" the first  in humor. (That's my overall point)."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow the new JoJo series looks GREAT!
tL4McUzXfFI,Was zum Heck 😂😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Ummmm I’m watching this
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is just another jojo bizare adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,great now every time i watch the actual jojo I think of this jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMANY HAS ZE GREATEST TECHNOLOGY IN ZEE WORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,Jews making comedy about natzis. Funny times we have right now.
tL4McUzXfFI,Banned in germany in 3...2...1...
tL4McUzXfFI,how many people did die to get the punch line
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a bullshit movie wtf is happening to this world this is a crime against young people
tL4McUzXfFI,im not sure if we are crossing a  point right now
tL4McUzXfFI,"To know the truth watch the greatest story never told, Europa the last battle, British historian David irving books and you tube videos, search on google,atrocities done on Germany after ww2 by red army, Dresden and other German cities bombed by allies. You can try billion times by writing fake history books hollywood movies to malign fuhrer we don't give a damn. Salute to truest patriot ever born martyr who lived each breath for his country died for his fatherland."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, they had to make a comedy with a kid's imaginary friend being Hitler? I'm sure they could found many other POSITIVE influences in history to depict as this kids imaginary friend. So unacceptable and im surprised to see it categorized as black comedy. Hollywood writing / creativity must be really hurting I gue$$ 👎💩"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Man, that is hilarious 1:32-1:38 when the kid says ""she doesn't seem like a bad person"" & imaginary Hitler kicks the chair. Legendary. Lmao. 👍 Hitlarious."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks about Reich
tL4McUzXfFI,this idea was taken from the haunting mause?
tL4McUzXfFI,*blows up a building accidentally* oh god...
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or is the german version of heroes from david Bowie the shit
tL4McUzXfFI,When you realize this is a relationship between Joeseph and Strohiem
tL4McUzXfFI,Gave me a laugh and one needs one with all these Socialist/Fascists  running around .Mel Brooks would approve !
tL4McUzXfFI,"It has that Wes Anderson feel to it, but without Wes Anderson."
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone  know  what's the second  song in the second  half  of  the  trailer ?
tL4McUzXfFI,The part 9 preview looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,Fantasy history?  People are no longer interested in real history.  Alternate history is good enough.  Real history is too complicated and unsettling.  It is too difficult to pick out the good guys from the bad guys.  Fantasy history is so much nicer.  It's clear and simple.
tL4McUzXfFI,Błowęn shtäf ap
tL4McUzXfFI,Mel Brooks approved
tL4McUzXfFI,ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA
tL4McUzXfFI,"This should not have been made, this is very disrespectful"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is wonderful. I can finally see a movie without being surrounded by resistor man children on dates with feminists who are paying for the date.
tL4McUzXfFI,Yo is this the new jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm living in bizarro world. I'm a longtime jojo fan but WTF is this movie and WTF IS THIS NORMAL TO ALL THE OTHER JOJO FANS???
tL4McUzXfFI,Thank God the jew that run The Hollywood  will give all the oscars to this movie about nazi.
tL4McUzXfFI,"100,335 Jewish people felt offended by the end of this trailer"
tL4McUzXfFI,YES! OH MY GOD YES! LMAFO! I hope the Jew girl kills hitler.

tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm debating on watching this or frozen 2, I could watch both but I wanna do it with friends"
tL4McUzXfFI,boring...
tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m not the only one getting moonrise kingdom vibes,right?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jestem ciekawy, czy będzie mozna obejrzeć to w Polsce?"
tL4McUzXfFI,BBBRAAAAKA MONOGAAAAA!!! DOITSU NO KAGAKUWA SEKAI ICHIIIIIIIIII!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Silly kids. That's not how you fire a Panzerschreck
tL4McUzXfFI,How much do y’all wanna bet that the snowflakes are gonna get pissed at this movie for making a serious part of history a movie comedy 😂 I’ll put $50 in the pot
tL4McUzXfFI,Didn't Mel Brooks also make a comic movie about Nazis?
tL4McUzXfFI,What the fuck is this? America really knows how to stoop so low!
tL4McUzXfFI,Yo jojo part 9 looks insane!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Does nazi speak english?
tL4McUzXfFI,So how exactly did this blundering buffoon named Hitler establish an efficient yet far too brutal empire? Just look at this clown!
tL4McUzXfFI,oh the hitler is his imaginary friend
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nice

Now do a same movie but with Communism"
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s not everyday you see Hitler eating a unicorn
tL4McUzXfFI,"Anyone else looking forward to all the complaints of having an all white cast? 

Me neither."
tL4McUzXfFI,A comedy about genocide... Good job losers
tL4McUzXfFI,wtf is this? Inglorious Basterds for children? looks awful
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok I'm done. A movie with Nazi theme.. and the name is basically.. JOJO
tL4McUzXfFI,I would lose my shit in the theater if Deacon from What We Do in the Shadows shows up in this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a nazi terminator the jewinator
tL4McUzXfFI,0:41 isn’t that the annoying dude from the tooth fairy
tL4McUzXfFI,"Before the trailer: WTF is dis
After the Trailer: Lol 😂 What now?"
tL4McUzXfFI,I wanna see it
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone worried that this trivializes Nazis and the horrible things they did?
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to top joker at the awards.
tL4McUzXfFI,Interesting!
tL4McUzXfFI,Never thought I'd see a fun loving Nazi flick lol
tL4McUzXfFI,"So let get this straight, this kind of comedy is alright when it’s written and directed by Taika but other comedies like Dave Chappell are banned, WTF?"
tL4McUzXfFI,The sequel is a family comedy about bin Laden
tL4McUzXfFI,"Part 7 dimension 
Jojo bizarre adventure part 2"

tL4McUzXfFI,Sono chido sadame!
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't know I needed a German version of heroes this much until now.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hate Nazis; but like the Producers, ill go watch this movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Your next line is; ""Hitler is JoJo's stand"", right?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn, this is one weird Jojo spin off"
tL4McUzXfFI,Being a nazi is fun!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Ya I like Wes Anderson also haha
tL4McUzXfFI,"THE MAKERS OF THIS  SH*T MOVIE  DON'T HAVE  A 
MORAL COMPASS"
tL4McUzXfFI,so much charm in this trailer.  hope it is not a lie when it  comes to the actual movie
tL4McUzXfFI,ha blow up the house and blame Winston Churchill. we'll negotiate
tL4McUzXfFI,Does anyone know what category it should fall to when flag for reporting?
tL4McUzXfFI,"“Awww that Adolf Hitler, what a character that guy was” Me when the film comes out."
tL4McUzXfFI,Nice propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi humor is the best humor.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Extra credits sees jojo trailer

tL4McUzXfFI,Aryan instinct
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim's origins
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,What the fudge did I just watch
tL4McUzXfFI,That fat lady teaching books reminds me so much about the fat lady from wolfenstein 2 💀
tL4McUzXfFI,"Poor people, they died just because one fat kid dropped a Panzerschreck!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Yo wtf is this racist shit why they trying to make nazis funny?
tL4McUzXfFI,Seems Legit...
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,Based on the book “Caging Skies” by Christine Leunens. It seems I must find this book immediately.
tL4McUzXfFI,I like the song
tL4McUzXfFI,The little boy with the glasses reminds me so much of Nick Frost.
tL4McUzXfFI,I love that they used the German version of Heroes
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim where are you?
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does hitler look like jim carrey ?
tL4McUzXfFI,The good old days
tL4McUzXfFI,This is interesting
tL4McUzXfFI,"Lol this looks really funny, I especially like how they portrayed Hitler is a funny, cute and loveable guy. Almost makes all the stuff he did seem like a just a big joke, and who’s to say? For all I know, it may well have been"
tL4McUzXfFI,I need to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,Very edgy
tL4McUzXfFI,Who came up with this shit?😂😂😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m going to NAZI this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,When you realize believer from smash mouth is in german
tL4McUzXfFI,Strohaim liked this movie as a kid
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is the type of satire that 2019 America would get pissed off about. Me, Saved is my favorite satire film of all time. This would looks hilarious! Can't wait"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yep they burned books!
It was jewish pornography !!"
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't understand this. Why are they making a natzi comedy movie? Seems like they are making fun of it all.
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie should be took down
tL4McUzXfFI,gay
tL4McUzXfFI,"“Because war, war never changes.”"
tL4McUzXfFI,"what a stupid movie, made by hollywood , they fantasize about nazis all the time. Projecting much? Typical hollywood"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I am a German and we are famous for two things: 1. We were Nazis and started WW2 and 2. We have no sense of humor.
And I have to say: I laughed hard... I mean I watched this trailer now more than a dozen times and I still laugh every time.
So yea I still feel guilty about our past, even though I also still use the excuse nearly all Germany use nowadays, that I haven't even been born back then, but we Germans share our generational guilt.
That means I should dislike this kind of movies on principle and this is reinforced by our genetically implanted absence of humor.
But this is just so well made that I can only feel guilty about liking this. And I really like it! I surely gonna watch it when it opens in Germany!"
tL4McUzXfFI,This film is sure to stir up a fuckton of controversy. I don't believe it's good idea to release a film satirizing nazism and war these days with all the white supremacists marching in the streets.
tL4McUzXfFI,Since when is there a German version of heros
tL4McUzXfFI,Eh... why do I have a feeling that imaginary Hitler isn't walking around in Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends?
tL4McUzXfFI,MAN! The 18th can't come fast enough!

tL4McUzXfFI,"“I wish more of our young boys, had your blind fanaticism”"
tL4McUzXfFI,TRASH
tL4McUzXfFI,Where's Hans Landa?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Now ""Stalins Death"" and now ""Jojo Rabbit"" and for some random reason They used British Actors in the both movies"
tL4McUzXfFI,There is nothing funny about hitler or the 85 million people who died during world war 2.
tL4McUzXfFI,"never once in ma life a trailer make me laugh this much. i'm hype to see this movie, even hyper than rick and morty"
tL4McUzXfFI,The strongest Joestar
tL4McUzXfFI,Yesss more bullshit propaganda!! Feed us more please!
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m not racist. I do love satire. I know this is satire. Is it wrong that I would want to see this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow this actually looks really good and super cute lol
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's 2019 and there's a badass comedy involving the 3rd Reich.

tL4McUzXfFI,The kid with glasses looks like the smaller version of nick frost
tL4McUzXfFI,This is one of the most bizarre trailers I've seen in a theater yet.
tL4McUzXfFI,"rated pg-13 
Me: makes sense"
tL4McUzXfFI,i am surprised have have not seen a comment where a Jewish person is offended
tL4McUzXfFI,von Stroheim Backstory         nice
tL4McUzXfFI,Love how many years ago we hated the nazis but now we are making movies with them as the main characters.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Idk why but I think the girl kinda ruins the comedy part, I wish it was just jojo and the imaginary hitler."
tL4McUzXfFI,nothing about the left wing Hitler who killed more people than right wing Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I lowkey feel bad for dis version of hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,Hold up I don't see von stroheim
tL4McUzXfFI,Dear Zionists we had it enough with these hitler movies. Please stop
tL4McUzXfFI,Where the fück is Von Stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,hitler's kinda cute in this one ngl 😉😉
tL4McUzXfFI,CGI looks very good. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost look like kids here.

tL4McUzXfFI,Scarlett’s Johansson is literally 5’3”. Goddamn
tL4McUzXfFI,"finally, a live action movie for jojo bizzare adventure"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Its not accurate.  Nazis didnt care about german/white jews.  They needed to have a semitic girl play the hidden jew, at least look like ann frank."
tL4McUzXfFI,"....wait, this isnt JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow this is too funny
tL4McUzXfFI,This kid looks like the kid from a Bronx tale

tL4McUzXfFI,"WW2 and Nazis are literally two of my favourite topics of all time.
This is the only movie I have ever wanted to watch. :)"
tL4McUzXfFI,What's the plot of the story. Hitler as imaginary friend?

Modern liberal arts students cheer..."
tL4McUzXfFI,the music is giving me a strangely powerful and nostalgic feeling im already excited for this film
tL4McUzXfFI,"Knowing nothing about the entirety of this film, but what it appears to me is this;  I wouldn't expect someone walking into Forrest Gump suspecting it to be Like Dumb and Dumber like this film anticipating a continual ""knee slapper"".  It already looks very professional but taking a circumstance of love and how it conquers all in a satirical approach to hate. I think a central point would be when the young woman responds to his "" a-jew"" with a ""gesundheit""(used to wish good health to a person who has just sneezed.)[perhaps in a slight way like a ""shalom"" if he would know loosely].  Not a pleading response but ""learning his language""  to show a human approach.  To be quite honest i believe this will be a self-encapsulated story with a moral as most stories ought to be to be taken for what it is.  Unless there is candid references to be made a mention to otherwise within the story I'd just enjoy it for what it is.  Love conquers all.  If that is the case that is good story-telling."
tL4McUzXfFI,"“It’s not a swastika, it’s a Jo Jo reference”"

""Now's not a good time to be a Nazi."" Such a well delivered line."
tL4McUzXfFI,_In an alternate reality where the nazis won the war and they decided to make family fun movies_
tL4McUzXfFI,I found the concept of this movie 100% offensive. But given the rise of racism in this country lately I'm not at all surprised.
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE GREATEST SCIENCE IN ZA WARUDO
tL4McUzXfFI,More Globalist propaganda to brainwash children about the approved official history. Poison
tL4McUzXfFI,cant wait to see Scarlett Johansson Have Not Seen Her Since Avenger's Endgame
tL4McUzXfFI,"Great concept for a film. Sam Rockwell is a wonderful actor, last time I saw him was a very sweet and nice scene with Julia Roberts."
tL4McUzXfFI,"thought this would have to with JOJO's bizarre adventures, looks fucking funny and tragic."
tL4McUzXfFI,I like how they’re not censoring Nazi imagery
tL4McUzXfFI,0:58 the finger movements like a monster in a horror movies
tL4McUzXfFI,"JoJo and Nazis
Stroheim?
IS GERMAN MEDICINE THE BEST?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Thanks for the wholesome Natzi movie Foxsearch
tL4McUzXfFI,im watching this movie with my friend this month.
tL4McUzXfFI,Music sounds like regular show
tL4McUzXfFI,"People used to be afraid of the old Hitler, but now, when we see this ""new"" Hitler, we'll just be like: *""LOL THIS GUY IS SO FUNNY""*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"BUT IT VAS ME DIO !!! ICH REJEKT MEINE HÜMANITY , JOJO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I fricking hope we will see Stroheim somewhere)"

tL4McUzXfFI,History teachers about to show this on class
tL4McUzXfFI,The song is Heroes but german version

tL4McUzXfFI,I hope this movie keeps the good elements of the book without the creepy parts that come later.
tL4McUzXfFI,All fun in games till the U.S joins the chat
tL4McUzXfFI,"LOVE IT! Perfect family entertainment! Now, time to blow the crap out of crap...great fun!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Great excuse for filling audience minds with nazi symbols. Nazi anything should never be depicted as funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,"“Looks good.”
-me 2019"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Осталось снять фильм про то как весело обазываться фикалиями! Есть личности, о которых должно быть упоминание только в учебниках истории! Однозначно - больше не смотрю фильмы этого режиссёра."
tL4McUzXfFI,This reminds me of Huckleberry Finn and Jim.
tL4McUzXfFI,Can we get a communist movie I'm tired of Jewish Hollywood showing ww2 hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,What's the second song called?
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone know what that 2nd song is?
tL4McUzXfFI,Znd blowing shtuf up
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika waititi as hitler 🤔......may be the first sing of the APOCALIX🤔
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does this look so good
tL4McUzXfFI,New season of jojos bizarre adventure looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,"“Woke and PC culture is ruining comedy.”

tL4McUzXfFI,"Yeah, no. Just no."

tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf! We should never EVER do this.
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks poop
tL4McUzXfFI,Dead 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a family friendly nazi movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Unpopular opinion: This movie reminds me a little bit of Life is Beautiful.
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought jojo already had a Nazi adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Phase 4 of the MCU is shaping up to be something...different.
tL4McUzXfFI,He says “you boys” but there is a group of girls doin squats at 0:13
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah, fun."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Movie character: it is definitely not a good time to become a nazi.

Me: when is there a good time?"
tL4McUzXfFI,heil jojo!
tL4McUzXfFI,Coming back to this trailer again to remind myself of how goddamn AMAZING this movie is. One of the best things I've ever seen.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo’s new stand is adolf hotler
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is the UK getting it released 4 months later than anywhere else?
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Burn the house down and blame it on Winston Churchill""

I WEAK"
tL4McUzXfFI,"_You thought it is the infamous cyborg _*_Stroheim, but it was I, JoJo Rabbit!_*"
tL4McUzXfFI,Adaptation of jojo bizarre adventure is werid
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo Von Stroheim
tL4McUzXfFI,"Another inaccurate movie about nazis to maks them look more evil than they already are, whats the problem with these people? Why won't they make a film about communism and their almost 60 million dead people that died of famine or execution."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is probally Stroheim's past no doubt about it..
tL4McUzXfFI,"Knowing Taika Waititi, I bet Jojo references would naturally work themselves into it."
tL4McUzXfFI,JoooooJooo
tL4McUzXfFI,Yes
tL4McUzXfFI,2:12 I dont know why but I hear dancing wilhelm
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm calling it now!
CNN: Jojo Rabbit will make it's watchers Nazi sympathizers."
tL4McUzXfFI,Black widow trailer? Someone did mention its a prequel
tL4McUzXfFI,"So an honest question, why do white people love movies like this? Does it help relieve guilt, is it because it's relatable, does it help take away the power from monsters, I really would like to know. 

- A black dude🤷🏾‍♂️"
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow that is going on here 🤨
tL4McUzXfFI,This is trash lol .
tL4McUzXfFI,Wonder why Charlie Chaplin is a 10 year old boys imaginary friend

tL4McUzXfFI,This is gonna be wonderful
tL4McUzXfFI,German science is the best in the world.
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if Taika is was paid an ungodly amount of money to play Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,*me just reading the comments and remembering Godwin’s Law* 😖
tL4McUzXfFI,Whats up with all the Nazi movies lately? Oh I forgot they wanna please the EU
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't like this movie.  It could be a bunch of wokeness. But it doesn't look right.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow I need to see this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Holy shit this is amazing. 

Teaching people about political brainwashing in a family friendly manner and on a light tone. And what better example to choose to represent this than the nazi indoctrination programs made to get people to support an agressive war machine? 

This has the potential to be a very educative piece of cinematography open to a large audience trough a thick layer of commedy. 

I am very much in support of this idea."
tL4McUzXfFI,Bowie is killer in every language.
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like a younger Natalie Dormer
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m going be totally honest here.. I did nazi that coming :/
tL4McUzXfFI,I was expecting a joestar
tL4McUzXfFI,Im very surprised that about 80% of today's society (y'know what I mean) hasn't had an uproar about this
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or is the Jewish girls actor super pretty...
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do these German people sound like they are chewing food on the side of their mouth
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi as Hitler looks A LOT like Fred Armisen.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf
tL4McUzXfFI,"Sorry Taika, this is just Moonrise Kingdom for Nazis."
tL4McUzXfFI,Just the trailer is a masterpiece.
tL4McUzXfFI,Blind fanaticism? Like modern liberals
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a jojo rabbit refrence?
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a movie those boomers!
tL4McUzXfFI,the joestars really did have a good relation with the nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,Better watch out the wall street journal might say you're a nazi sympathizer

tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler & me

In theatres this Christmas"
tL4McUzXfFI,So comedy ISNT Dead
tL4McUzXfFI,"There is going to be controversy, I know it."
tL4McUzXfFI,Why? Why does this movie exist?
tL4McUzXfFI,Whats the 2nd song of the trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,This could of been good if they didn’t make it so stupid. You can make it humorous with a good story and good actors without the silliness. What a waste.
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait to see what kinda lies journos will say about this movie after they get bored of crying about Joker.
tL4McUzXfFI,A JOJO that's a Nazi...I wonder what his stand is

tL4McUzXfFI,Disney finally tracking back to its roots
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Comments are not disabled""
Well color me surprised."
tL4McUzXfFI,I never thought Disney would make something like this  again
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait they getting mad at Chrissy teigan for her tattoo that looks like the tats from the holocaust, but people ain’t losing there shit over a movie about nazi camp ?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh, so Stroheim named his son after Joseph."
tL4McUzXfFI,Huh... battle tendency looks different than I remember
tL4McUzXfFI,OMG Is that a freaking unicorn for hilters dinner
tL4McUzXfFI,YOU UTTER FOOL! GERMAN MOVIES ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"For fucks sake... We have enough WW2 video games and movies for 100 lifetimes. All the current writers and directors at Hollywood are useless, and need to be replaced asap!"

tL4McUzXfFI,was that a JoJo's reference
tL4McUzXfFI,The songs are German covers of “I’m A Believer” and “Heroes”
tL4McUzXfFI,*Produced by Walt Disney Studios*
tL4McUzXfFI,Yay more nonsensical propaganda from Jewish Hollywood mongrols :D
tL4McUzXfFI,"I will watch this and hope for an appearance by my favorite German Soldier, Von Stroheim"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh, I'm so watching this just for the lols"
tL4McUzXfFI,This can be offensive to Jews if they see the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Walt disney got his lungs fixed just to spit out his last line: ""damn it they did it first"""
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks like trash....
tL4McUzXfFI,this is the most random plot ive ever seen
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks so good but I'm worried this will be one of those movies where they used every funny clip in the trailer...
tL4McUzXfFI,Thanks for all the support! Is my acting good?
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's Bizarre World War 2 Adventures.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jesus I love JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure but y’all are annoying as hell

tL4McUzXfFI,*_BBBBRRRAAAAAKAA   MMMOONNNOOOOGAAAAAAAA_*
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if this has gotten the Mel Brooks seal of approval yet?
tL4McUzXfFI,new zealand director.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Your next words are ""Is this a jojo reference?"""
tL4McUzXfFI,This... gives me a completely different perspective on the nazis.
tL4McUzXfFI,Hollywood mocks but they’re low key terrified.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is not JoJo I was looking for, but this is theird Reich JoJo that I needed"
tL4McUzXfFI,Shit. This will blow up like a panzerschreck through that windowsill.
tL4McUzXfFI,"2:02 This part has made my mind, I’m seeing this movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks kinda stupid
tL4McUzXfFI,ok...so it's not JoJo but JoJo rabbit...and I think this one will be funnnnnnnnn
tL4McUzXfFI,"I didn’t think we would see a George Soros biopic this soon but hey, it looks pretty good!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Грязная хуцпа!
tL4McUzXfFI,The style looks a lot like one of those Wes Anderson movies. It could be Oscar material!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Based on a true story of Trump supporters.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Can't wait for the sequel, JoJo Rabbits adventures in Auschwitz"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hate how they speak broken english. Like either let them talk in german and have them with subtitles or just speak normal english. But having them speak weird english in a ""german"" accebt is just dumb. And this shit happens all the time"
tL4McUzXfFI,At the end his friend just does a complete English accent 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"Somewhere in the background, you can see Stroheim leading his troops lol"
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope this doesn't get censored in Germany
tL4McUzXfFI,How von stroheims childhood was like
tL4McUzXfFI,There better be a character called Stroheim in Mexico.

tL4McUzXfFI,Everyone hyped for Joker and I'm hyped for this.
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm intrigued.
tL4McUzXfFI,Yup this is what socialism did. Vote republican
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Children, it's time to burn some books!"" Magic words for just about every school kid, ever..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I will not lie. I was laughing my ass off the entire time
tL4McUzXfFI,Should we romanticize a group who dreamed of genocide?
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow the Jews who own Hollywood made another nazi propaganda brainwash flick 80 years later. Who would've thought
tL4McUzXfFI,"When I searched for a Jojo movie this isn't what I had in mind.








But I'm satisfied none the less."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nazi version of Stranger Things







I like it"
tL4McUzXfFI,"You thought that this was a JoJo reference...




YOU FELL FOR IT, FOOL! THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,You know most people wouldn’t want “Imaginary Hitler” on their CV but Taika isn’t most people

tL4McUzXfFI,"Now let’s make a comedy about George w Bush and dick cheyne the chicken hawks waging war on iraqi women, children, and babies for being Islamic terrorist."
tL4McUzXfFI,Pojebało kurwa ??!
tL4McUzXfFI,So Hitler is a figment of jojo imagination to make up for the father figure he either lost or never had
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nazi Germany: ""Ten year olds shouldn't be discussing war and politics!""

Modern Day: ""HEY KIDS, YOU WANNA KNOW HOW TO DANCE IN A STRIP CLUB???"""
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder how much the wealthy Jewish donors who helped make this movie will be getting besides the aid the US already gives them each year.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I have a feeling, Mr. Taika is playing an imaginary friend of the boy."
tL4McUzXfFI,Man the Liberals are going to devour this
tL4McUzXfFI,Only propaganda. Nothing new.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, when I get to the pearly gates and get sent to the flaming pit of damnation, I'll know how I got there...

tL4McUzXfFI,Watching this would teach me a lot more shit then history class ever did
tL4McUzXfFI,Blind nationalism.....nothing the nazis did was nationalist. The Jews were more German Nationalistic then them but still pretty good trailer.

tL4McUzXfFI,German Science is best science
tL4McUzXfFI,"I mean, uh, alright. Cool. Sure."

tL4McUzXfFI,If the guy who made this didn't hate his home country so badly this might have done well down there! Karma I guess
tL4McUzXfFI,I love how jojo’s fans have infected the comment section
tL4McUzXfFI,"All the diskikes are jewish... I meant ""dislikes"". Damn auto-korrekt....."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, part 9 of JoJo looks goood!"

tL4McUzXfFI,MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA
tL4McUzXfFI,This is genuis!! A satirical WW2 film!!
tL4McUzXfFI,You ever see something so surreal that you're not sure it's real even though you're looking at it?
tL4McUzXfFI,I think I'm going to spend the movie to see this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"JOJO, CHAMBER WIND"
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm sorry but I really want to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,Ima love those shit so much
tL4McUzXfFI,the jew kinda looks like Michael Cera
tL4McUzXfFI,"When the girl came out of hiding her fingers hit the door frame almost like a horror movie, probably symbolizing how jojo sees the Jewish people at the time  and he will  gradually realize their humanity and the lies of the propaganda. 

Taika waitit is a genius"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Idk. A ""funny"" movie about a very terrible chaotic time where ppl were brainwashed to believe in Nazism? 😏"
tL4McUzXfFI,Shrek supports the third reich

tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo Nazi Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Can’t wait to see this movie. What’s the song at the end of the trailer. It’s says “Dancing with heaven”
tL4McUzXfFI,Hang on how is black widow still alive
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally
tL4McUzXfFI,How did they find a young Simon Pegg and Nick Frost to play the two boys? Time travel? I'm thinking time travel.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is not the JoJo's reference I was thinking about.
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s a Monty python sketch with a bigger budget I’m sold
tL4McUzXfFI,"You thought it was jojos bizarre adventure but it was me, HITLER"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Fun fact: Hitler took heroin and other similar drugs daily becuase he had chronic pain. His doctor(I've forgotten his name) would also give Hitler and  his wife Eva aphrodisiacs, and there were many counts of them going at it like animals, and Hitlers back being covered in scratch marks."
tL4McUzXfFI,Jews instigated the Russian revolution and were trying to inact a similar violent overthrow in Germany. Thats why they were put in camps. Not because they read the Torah.
tL4McUzXfFI,jojo’s bizzare abenteuer
tL4McUzXfFI,"I thought the german music where just for the german trailer but that's really the music XD omg, Waititi is a comedy genius xD"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Besides its funny..







... IS THIS A WORK OF AN ENEMY STAND ?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Never saw a movie with Nazis that looked so exciting! By the way, let me remind you that according to the research of British professor Antony C. Sutton, Hitler and the Bolsheviks were both financed by Wall Street. Crazy world, isn't it?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Disappointed. Where's the homosexual Nazi saying: ''SpeEeEedWaaaaaGOonnnnnn?''
tL4McUzXfFI,Von Stroheim's childhood I see.
tL4McUzXfFI,"anyone else noticed the ""heroes"" German version playing in the background?"
tL4McUzXfFI,And that same jewish girl will grow up to kill Palestinians and steal their land...

Who needs to burn books when you can ghost ban.... We will will brainwash the younger generation with our rain dancing primitive nature worshiping voodoo to accept privilege and burn rights.  People having rights is what put a hole in the ozone and killed the dodo and now these horrible rights are melting the ice caps.  We must end rights and voting and representation.  It is the only way to save the world.  Just put your faith in our big tech and their kinder gentler euthanization robots.

I am working on a short film that I am developing and I thought it would be great to leave it here and hope that someone sees and and possibly makes a tiny donation. Every little thing helps, even the 1$ ones as it helps us get traction with Indiegogo and then more people see it. The story is about three people who are being forced into a life of forensic cleaning. Have a look at the page and see if there's anything you like! Thank you everyone!"

tL4McUzXfFI,"This is just despicable, rude and altogether without respect for one of the most dreadful moments in human history. 

Millions lost their lives in this conflict, children were brainwashed and used as cannon fodder and now some ignorant fool is making a movie out of it.
This is not a subject to make a light-hearted movie about."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally a Nazi movie with Genre "" Comedy"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hey, this live action spin-off of Jojo looks good, is it Stroheim's Bizarre Adventure?"

tL4McUzXfFI,"What a 'Bizarre Adventure'.

tL4McUzXfFI,"How can Hitler be an imaginary friend when he is our real friend? All you have to do is reach out to him, and his spirit will enter into your heart if you let him."

tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler: oh, you're approaching me, instead of running away you're coming right to me?

Hitlers assassin: well i cannot beat the sheisse out of you without getting any closer."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Chads be like: ""OMG BRO, BECAUSE THIS MOVIE IS OWNED BY FOX AND FOX AND DISNEY MERGED. DISNEY IS SUPPORTING NAZISM!!!"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"Heh heh heh.... Okay, who's bright idea was it to make a movie about a German boy idolizing Hitler *just* to piss off the SJWs?! Because, if they *R E A L L Y* want to piss them off, make an animated movie of Adolf Hitler adopting an autistic, blind two-legged puppy and protects it from a fatal bullet laced with measles and he dies because his mom is an anti-vaxxer that loves to dye her skin neon orange and bleaching and cutting her hair until it looks like a flaxen version of this:

tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah, so the ""Soul Stone"" Black Widow was actually just a time looping clone of herself. The real Black Widow used the Time Stone before Thanos destroyed them unnoticeably, and got sent to 1941. Eureka! She is alive."
tL4McUzXfFI,If you liked Taika's Thor Ragnarok and this looks good to you check out his last film Hunt for the Wilderpeople. It's hilarious and really well done and currently on Hulu.
tL4McUzXfFI,Replace the NAZIs with ANTIFA and its a modern setting for the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Count Dankula almost went to jail for something like this and these guys are getting paid?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Disney now owns Fox, which means this is a Disney film. Epic"
tL4McUzXfFI,"there's only one jew
*accurate100*"
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF
tL4McUzXfFI,Very educational i must say.
tL4McUzXfFI,"remember that the ideal aryan must be handsome like Goebbels, athletic like Goering and blond like Hitler."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm not gonna lie, I clicked the video expecting a JoJo joke reference in the comment, haven't found any so far :/
Edit:

tL4McUzXfFI,If you guy's are trying to find I'm believer look up Jack whites.
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks funny. Antifascist and saying this
tL4McUzXfFI,Only problem with this is the lack of brown eyes on hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,"""You know what I am?"" - ""A Jew"" - ""Gesundheit"" - The best and worst pun I have heard for a long time."
tL4McUzXfFI,A bit like Die Blechtrommel movie
tL4McUzXfFI,So an antifa training video. Not interested.
tL4McUzXfFI,Music?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Anyone else Muselk’s Minecraft playlist

tL4McUzXfFI,I can already Hitler rolling in his grave over being played for comedy by a Polynesian Jew- hell yeah! This movie looks great and Taika is the first person I would trust to pull it off
tL4McUzXfFI,"I... I feel kind of sick after watching this. Like, Life Is Beautiful walked a really thin line. And Thor Ragnarok just felt unpleasant to me with all the goofy humor completely erasing the gravity of the serious events happening in the plot. I don't know what the hell point this film will try to make, but I don't want to see it to find out."
tL4McUzXfFI,This... Quiet offend my right-wing views
tL4McUzXfFI,What we really do in the shadows.
tL4McUzXfFI,why his stand looks like hitler ?

tL4McUzXfFI,JoJos bizarre adventure.
tL4McUzXfFI,"What is a ""stand"" people keep saying in comments?"
tL4McUzXfFI,by looking at this it seems the world is changing
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t expect this to do well in the box office.
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m very much looking forward to this.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a time travelling young nick frost?
tL4McUzXfFI,Why the German accent?
tL4McUzXfFI,Did we happen to mention it's a SATIRE?
tL4McUzXfFI,There is only one generation of jojos
tL4McUzXfFI,Not much has changed
tL4McUzXfFI,When you get sacrificed for the soul stone so you raise a child who’s imaginary friend is hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,Hail Taika!
tL4McUzXfFI,"So uh, what r they odds the SJW and Feminazi coming together and fighting against each other for this film?"
tL4McUzXfFI,a meme is born

tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi doesn't need to punch down! Offensive!

tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder who is behind this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Too soon?
tL4McUzXfFI,meanwhile in Wolfenstain universe
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi is one crazy MOFO and I love him for it.

tL4McUzXfFI,I hope this turns into some Tarantino type shit
tL4McUzXfFI,korg became a soldier now?
tL4McUzXfFI,So.... wheres the buff aztec god of fitness?
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Inglourious Basterds"" meets (or, rather, violently collides with) ""The Diary of Anne Frank"". Hard pass."
tL4McUzXfFI,Im going to watch this with stroheim
tL4McUzXfFI,"If the film is one-tenth as good as this trailer, it's a winner..."
tL4McUzXfFI,The only nazi I wanna see is a dead one
tL4McUzXfFI,"Black widow: *dies in endgame and gets reborn a Nazi*
Me: Reddit’s about to have some fun"
tL4McUzXfFI,"At first I was like 'Nazis in a movie, in 2019?' then I watched the trailer and realised making this movie was the Reich call."
tL4McUzXfFI,OY VEY!
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is like 3 diffrent ideas for movies in one but they seem seprated like you have the nazi comedy the comeing of age ""your growing up too fast"" tale and the romio and Juliet ""nazi befriends a jew"" story and NONE of them intermingle"
tL4McUzXfFI,Worst part about this are the insufferable weebs in the comments
tL4McUzXfFI,The darkest jostar
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this Von Stroheim's origin story?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I wonder how there going to add the Americans ...hmm

tL4McUzXfFI,Well this looks delightful!
tL4McUzXfFI,"It’s so weird how this is a Fox Searchlight Picture because before I saw this trailer, I saw the trailer of 28 Days later which was also a Fox Searchlight picture...

Man, what a coincidence..."
tL4McUzXfFI,It's nice  to see a movie with only white people and 1 white passing brownie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Ngl this looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,How the fuck did this kid learn of the Joestar secret technique
tL4McUzXfFI,It's Von Stroheim
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nazis: kills a bunch of people/world takeover (fail)
Show biz: makes people laugh about the true humanity of people (success)"
tL4McUzXfFI,Great. Another movie pushing a false narrative about hitler and Nazi germany.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand Name - 「ADOLF HITLER」
Power: A
Speed: B
Range: B
Durability: C

Development Potential: C

Stand User - 「JOJO RABBIT」"
tL4McUzXfFI,"That's funny, I don't remember taking acid today.."
tL4McUzXfFI,Maybe the funniest movie I will ever see...ahahhaha
tL4McUzXfFI,A Maori person playing Hitler

tL4McUzXfFI,Is nobody gonna talk about the German Smash Mouth cover at the beginning?
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh thats why that the Nazi loosing the war so quickly !
tL4McUzXfFI,I only liked the beginning then they ruined it. It's like Marley and me.
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t like it.
tL4McUzXfFI,Anne Frank headin out
tL4McUzXfFI,"Gotta love that german version of ""Heroes"""
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
tL4McUzXfFI,It's good seeing children get  to blow stuff up
tL4McUzXfFI,Seems like the Nazi version of Drop Dead Fred.
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF is this ? Lol
tL4McUzXfFI,How is this acceptable?
tL4McUzXfFI,A satirical movie of Nazi Germany and the Hitler Youth. Not sure it's something to joke about.
tL4McUzXfFI,I dont know what this is. I don't know why I clicked on it. I dont know why I want to watch it...
tL4McUzXfFI,Imagine real Hitler watching this from hell.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's German Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Heil Jojo...
tL4McUzXfFI,I swear there better be a Grammar Nazi in it. Wolfenstein didn't miss the opportunity and neither should Taika
tL4McUzXfFI,Dafuq......haahahahahaa
tL4McUzXfFI,Has Hitler himself been revived for this movie to be made?! Can't wait!
tL4McUzXfFI,How to end your acting career you ask? Just star in a movie about fun nazi...
tL4McUzXfFI,............. Another Nazi based movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,What is this infatuation with Nazism. Want to know what Nazis did watch Schindler's list or a WW2 documentary. At least with films like the producers or Indiana Jones Nazis are the subject of ridicule or the villians...I know this is a satire but portraits of Hitler as imaginary friend etc...make light of a very very dark period of humanity  not even 100 years ago. What next? Jojo Rabbit 2: My Best Friend Stalin? Followed by a series of films dedicated to every fascist or dictatorship regime. Fascist Fun for the whole family.
tL4McUzXfFI,"How many of us were expecting  
Anime?"
tL4McUzXfFI,That looks brilhant
tL4McUzXfFI,the left isn't going ape shit over this....somethings not right.
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's made me feel good, now I will return working because that's free here... or was that it makes free? Whatever soon our dept will be paied of and another war will start."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is the humor that made Disney reject Pewdiepie. Now they do it them self but on steroids.
LOL! 😂👌😂👌😂👌"
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope you the movie ends before the soviets get to them
tL4McUzXfFI,The best movi of nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,Other Jewish Movie...???
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this movie a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Thanks Obama
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nice. A movie that will explain you utter fools, why German science is the world's finest."
tL4McUzXfFI,Who tf asked for this . Like at all ..
tL4McUzXfFI,The Panzershrek got me. I destroyed that word didn’t I?
tL4McUzXfFI,SO NO CHI NI SADAME DEEEEERR FÜHREEEEE~~~~
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is this in muselks play list for minecraft
tL4McUzXfFI,O wow look another propaganda movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh, so a film wher a Na- german soldier is a main character and Hitler too. And it's a wierd comedy. I LOVE IT"
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo and Der Fuehrer adventure !
tL4McUzXfFI,The actor playing Hitler looks so much like an inocent guy i cant even think he is Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope Stroheim makes an appearance.
tL4McUzXfFI,You utter fool! German science is the best in the world!
tL4McUzXfFI,Honestly brilliant movie idea
tL4McUzXfFI,the is gonna cause some trouble i just know it. still looks funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,Coincided with the Blenheim Palace Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,What is it with America? Does it have a Nazi fetish or something? I think these movies have more to do with collective consciousness of America than Nazis...this and inglourious bastards ...deep down I think it's disappointment in themselves... couldn't reach a Nazi level...and had to borrow a lot of stuff from them. Trying really hard to re-live those times in grandeur and illusion. When bad guy is more awesome than hero...every war become a Pyrrhic war...it was very difficult for self conscious America I think... May be batman felt the same after the dark knight movie...joker didn't exactly lose there.
tL4McUzXfFI,Dan sind wir helden!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,JOJO rabbits bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,He looks like the kid from Meet the Robinson's
tL4McUzXfFI,finally some fucking good movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Man, part 9 of Jojo’s bizarre adventure looks pretty good. Can’t believe they brought back stroheim from the dead just for it, too"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing!
tL4McUzXfFI,"In the future, we will have a movie like this but it'll be about North Korea."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wtf is this, r people tryna make fun of the war or something?? This is messed up."
tL4McUzXfFI,"SMRT FAŠIZMU, SLOBODA NARODU!"
tL4McUzXfFI,What the hell happened to Korg and Natasha
tL4McUzXfFI,I would watch this
tL4McUzXfFI,*Jojo : Bizarre The Führer*
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Blazing Saddles"" was a satire that ridiculed racism in America.  It was viewed in it's time as an all-time great movie.  Couldn't possibly be made today.


JoJo Rabbit is a satire that ridiculed National Socialism in Germany.  It is viewed now as an all-time great movie.  The shine will wear off as the stick-up-the-arse crowd tells us why this is actually a very, very, very bad movie!!  [le sigh]"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is stupid, can we give up on the whole nazi everything? Seems theres always something being made that has to do with them"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wonder how many times communist hollywood will try to sneak in trump or conservative comparisons in to ruin the entire movie.  Since everything since 2016 coming from the movie and gaming industry ""has"" to have some kind of underlying propaganda narative......"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks so good
tL4McUzXfFI,"Now, make a film where Jews are the Nazis and Palestinians are Nazis. See how ""funny"" and ""popular"" that becomes!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"1:52 That guy on the right of the truck looks just like a grown up Peter Kranz, the Hitler Youth boy from Downfall (Der Untergang)!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Moro na Alemanha e posso garantir que a maioria das pessoas ainda tem mentalidade nazista. Eles nao gostam de estrangeiros. As pessoas raramente sentam perto de mim no trem ou VLT. Eles dizem que mudaram, mas a maioria nao gosta de estrangeiros. Tá no sangue dos alemaes."
tL4McUzXfFI,The only thing that bothers me is the fake German accent. Just have them speak plain old English
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks great, funny and the first film since Mel Brooks The producers to really take the piss out of the nazis.
Mind you, I bet there's going to be complaints from miserable, po faced muppets that it's in bad taste, insults the memory of the holocaust etc blah blah blah. It's a film.
It looks good.

tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone else think Hitler looks like Jacob Rees-Mogg?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This should be from the directors of ""What we do in the shadows"""
tL4McUzXfFI,That unicorn was from a cave in North Korea.
tL4McUzXfFI,"...and the little girl got gassed in Auschwitz at the end. Oh yes, a great fun theme and even better ending!  Some things are not to be joked with, people. WW2 and Nazis and ""a final solution"" tops that list. Respect millions and millions of victims. This is the most inconsiderate movie ever."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ooo, I lost a bit of za weight in this film"
tL4McUzXfFI,Fun fact: That German version of Heroes was sung by Bowie himself. The whole album was recorded in Germany and he decided to make a German version.
tL4McUzXfFI,Love from Germany this movie is super nice

tL4McUzXfFI,"""Burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill... Or negotiate."""

tL4McUzXfFI,"The entire duration of WWll 

Nazis: 2:08"
tL4McUzXfFI,“Burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill” hahahahah
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait for the scene which the nazi kid finds Santana and starts to hear Aztec Dubstep.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow! what a trailer! The world can do a lot better with more Wes Anderson-esque movies...
tL4McUzXfFI,FIGHTIIIING GOOOOOLD!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone else notice how the trailer pretty much told us the entire plot of the movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,Critics suck it. Wins TIFF and ready for oscar now
tL4McUzXfFI,"I expect in the sequel is gonna have an time skip to 1987 where JoJo goes to Egypt to fight David Bowie but he's a 120 year old  vampire and his army of weirdos.. and jojo has some weird Japanese nephew because his daughter married a Japanese man in the 60s  (i hope you get the reference, wrrryyyyy!!!!)"

tL4McUzXfFI,Good lifestyle for white peoples
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow... Nazi murdered so many... Not that long ago. Here we are tho making a Hitler Family Movie for all ages lol! WTF world!
tL4McUzXfFI,"85 million people were killed during world war 2. it's beyond heretical to treat a moment like this of history as comedy for profit. 

Screw you all, I am a going home."
tL4McUzXfFI,I want a nazi zombie unicorn
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn’t see a panzerkampfwagen

tL4McUzXfFI,Alot of people are saying why is there a new movie about the Joker? And i am like jesus fucking Christ no another movie about nazis and jews!
tL4McUzXfFI,Well this is one odd and unique movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Stfu
tL4McUzXfFI,So how long is it going to take for them to blame Trump for this
tL4McUzXfFI,Not scared of political correctness finally
tL4McUzXfFI,Ryan George has to make a pitch meeting on this when it comes out
tL4McUzXfFI,Will this movie be shown in Germany? Just curious
tL4McUzXfFI,Inglorious Parody
tL4McUzXfFI,"nazis on history books written by jews is fake news , hiedler saved germany from the private banks by making it's own value. like a country now days would exit from euro money. BCE on euro which means european central bank."

tL4McUzXfFI,I am a nazi cyborg that kills vampiers and i must Say that this is good
tL4McUzXfFI,What do you think Hitler Requiem's ability would be?
tL4McUzXfFI,This actually looks like it might be pretty good
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't feel comfortable with my children watching this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Does anyone else think between Adolf Hitler as a fun-loving character kind of wrong?
tL4McUzXfFI,that moment when hitler is your friend
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm confused





THOUGH I LIKE IT"
tL4McUzXfFI,Does anyone know if these songs are on Spotify? Loving these takes on I'm A Believer and Heroes.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Idk, but I'm obsessed with ScarJo's wink at the beginning."
tL4McUzXfFI,I really hope this movie is as good  as it looks :)
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if David Bowie was alive if he would have given the go on the release of Hero's for this movie. Either way.... A funny Nazi flick is a kicker and about time for originality sake. Looking forward to seeing this one on the BIG SCREEN!
tL4McUzXfFI,"It’s funny that Democrats call Trump a Nazi but they’re just like them, censorship and propaganda."
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim's son is a JoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,What a gay looking movie
tL4McUzXfFI,*JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJO!!!!!!!!!!!!*

tL4McUzXfFI,"""I will burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill"" Let's be honest we all thought of that excuse once or twice he he"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Why have so many countries other than Germany kicked out jews for their actions? Follow the money, don't believe everything your told."
tL4McUzXfFI,This film is wrong! Shouldn't glorify the hatred the Nazis created!
tL4McUzXfFI,David Bowie probably worked with Nazis and satanists! He was a satanists him self!
tL4McUzXfFI,Man JoJo chapter 10 looks great.
tL4McUzXfFI,I can already imagine people showing up during the movie release wearing all the Jojo cosplay.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow is 70 years enough time to now create a comedy on the worst war in the world!
tL4McUzXfFI,If this is legal in the uk is count dankula gunna get his case overturned and appropriately compensated?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Meanwhile, in Russia:
Stalingrado
Meanwhile, in Spain:
Civil war.
Meanwhile, in Japan:
Hiroshima, Nagasaki
*In Germany*
Hmmmm, unicorns... yummy yummy"
tL4McUzXfFI,The ending is probably he Mets the real hitler and then he forgets about his imaginary hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone know what the name is of the last song?

tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim: GERMAN MOVIE IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,Watch “Schindler’s List” first and then tell me a comedy with a touch of heart about Nazi’s and WW2 is good for a laugh.  This is a very confused idea for a movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,I wanna see it right now!
tL4McUzXfFI,Not only does this look insanely funny it also seems clear that it will be adorably charming
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy crap the kid with glasses looks like a young Nick frost
tL4McUzXfFI,This  guy creates some of the only child characters that I can enjoy watching. In
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim gets a stand
tL4McUzXfFI,Whoever is managing this channel should give me back my comment since it literally has nothing wrong with it
tL4McUzXfFI,0:00 song?
tL4McUzXfFI,In all honesty this looks like a great film with a lot of heart in it despite the bleak and contrivirsial setting
tL4McUzXfFI,"So... this film a motherfucking jojoke, and the great plot is that his father is Major Stroheim, and that's why he don't appear on the clips, and the boy name is Jojo, as a tribute to Joseph, and Hitler is his stand (just like everyone already said)?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Watched this yesterday at TIFF, it's really good and hilarious!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"OOOHHHH, Adolf Hitler is his imaginary friend"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Woah how did they record this in the past, they didn’t even have video cameras"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Song:
Jack White mit all deiner liebe

tL4McUzXfFI,The cutest Nazi movie ever!
tL4McUzXfFI,This is gonna be a beautiful movie!
tL4McUzXfFI,That's... not what I was expecting...
tL4McUzXfFI,Hopefully they didn't mess up and make Wehrmacht troops Nazis/ SS.
tL4McUzXfFI,"So,  jojo part 9 ""jojorabbit"" will be a movie instead of a comic.... Interesting, Araki....."
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is this in muselks play list for minecraft

tL4McUzXfFI,SHE’S IN ZI ATTIC!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Gayyyyyyyyy
tL4McUzXfFI,so many fricking weebs thought that this was a jojo's live action adaptation
tL4McUzXfFI,This better not have some twisted sad ending that will make me cry
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks like absolute trash.
tL4McUzXfFI,So no stroheim? Aw
tL4McUzXfFI,Also a film that deals with the children of Germany drawn into the war and sent to fight in the dying days of the regime is well overdue.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I was not expecting to get so emotional to the point of tears watching this trailer, but, welp, here we are. Taika, you've done it again with your heartbreaking odd-ball coming of age stories."
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally. Some awesome Nazi Swastikas.
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if there’s a type of boy who’s stand is *BeNIto MuSSolInI?*
tL4McUzXfFI,"I dunno...I'm not sure this one's going to work. Usually when films do Nazis, they either do them completely serious or complete jokes. Trying to do both at the same time is a bit risky..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I think i will love this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"From the trailer you can see this film also shows its dark side in the form of a comedy, which I find a comedy film sometimes needs that to bring a story together in my opinion"
tL4McUzXfFI,10/10 Movie of The Year
tL4McUzXfFI,I am curious. Will there be merchandizing? Like Star War's action figuers.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is Taika wearing whiteface?
tL4McUzXfFI,Strolheim
tL4McUzXfFI,I love how this went from a comedy to an actual drama in the span of 5 seconds
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh sweet Jesus I wanna see this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is totally a Wes Anderson movie rip-off. Deadpan, Same framing, similar color palette, similar soundtracks, camera framings..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope this doesn’t get censored.
tL4McUzXfFI,i know about world war 2 and watching this is so funny!
tL4McUzXfFI,what is the song in the trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,Shouldn’t it be called JewJew Rabbit?
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF YES!
tL4McUzXfFI,Life of a Hitlerjugend in the Second World War and a horrifying Anne Frank in the Secret Annex?
tL4McUzXfFI,I guess a New Zealand Jew(ish person) can get by with this
tL4McUzXfFI,"Because of the questions: David Bowie sang a German version of ""Heroes"" named ""Helden"". That's the song in the trailer."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks so good
tL4McUzXfFI,Only a New Zealander can get away with making a movie like this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"walks in




*HNN HNNNNN*"
tL4McUzXfFI,Im so glad we finally have a movie with no Coverser.....
tL4McUzXfFI,"when that bazooka fires I'm in stitches that's my kind of English humour. yes, I know Taika Waititi is a kiwi."
tL4McUzXfFI,oh boy i cant wait to hear the stand cry
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just remember...


*This movie is owned by Disney*"
tL4McUzXfFI,This needs to be watched
tL4McUzXfFI,JOJOOOOOOOOOO!!
tL4McUzXfFI,You're going to get caught by the very children you are deceiving.
tL4McUzXfFI,What's the name of the song at the begining? PLEASE :c
tL4McUzXfFI,Welcome to Germany
tL4McUzXfFI,Look like Von Strohiem's origin story.
tL4McUzXfFI,Loki? Jojo! (Booooooooooom!) oh god! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,"Title: *has jojo in it*
Jojo fans: allow us to introduce ourselves..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I'd laugh if this got best selling this year. Definitely made me laugh just watching the trailer. Looks like this will be a good movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Im scared of liking it incase someone looks at it and thinks im a n**i [cuz im british] and we hate germans apparently but not all of us
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ahhh, the Live Action Adaptation of An Education for Death that we never knew was possible."
tL4McUzXfFI,Song names English?
tL4McUzXfFI,So The Part 9 Jojo is rabbit
tL4McUzXfFI,"I love how all the soundrack is actually sung in German... :)
I'm so gona watch this"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Instead of making movies about Nazi owner and over, Hollywood. Why don’t you make some film about what you do in Palestine??"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitlerjunge Quex: Ein Film vom Opfergeist der deutschen Jugend 1933, the best film."
tL4McUzXfFI,I've always wondered why they keep making movies of such a terrible human being. Comedy or not. Than again we live in an idiotic   society.
tL4McUzXfFI,"If it's a comedy, fine. A drama, fine. But a mutated combination of both? No, not for me. Millions didn't suffer torture and death so we could have JoJo Rabbit."
tL4McUzXfFI,imagine the same thing with a runaway slave girl and european boy in America
tL4McUzXfFI,Thats not kosher
tL4McUzXfFI,the side story of jojo Battle Tendency
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't fucking wait for this
tL4McUzXfFI,I hate Taika with passion. I dont think i've ever wanted to punch someone in the face like him
tL4McUzXfFI,Jooooooooojo
tL4McUzXfFI,"""it's definitely not a good time to be a Nazi who speaks english and has a British accent"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"How fun, a movie starring Hitler!






Not really.
It's the most retarded idea I've ever heard"
tL4McUzXfFI,"they love me now, how intriguing"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ist dies eine Jojo-Referenz?




(Translate it to english)"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks so good. I giggled like a kid watching this trailer. Cant wait
tL4McUzXfFI,is this suppost to be funny? cuz it annoys me a bit
tL4McUzXfFI,get back to your roots
tL4McUzXfFI,"So this boy has a friend who cannot be seen by normal people around him and his name is jojo

You guys know where this is going right?"
tL4McUzXfFI,So I guess Stroheim will be in this film then?
tL4McUzXfFI,I'll watch anything Taika makes
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm curious how this movie was green lit lol.
tL4McUzXfFI,*ZA WARU-* wait wrong jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,"Reminds me of "" boy "" but a nazi version . I'm guessing some hard and sad truths behind the humour."
tL4McUzXfFI,"See? Black Widow survived, she was just sent back to 1942."
tL4McUzXfFI,Which song is this
tL4McUzXfFI,joooooooooooooooooooooojooooooooooooooooooo
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, a Nazi film for a whole family!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Imagine Sacha Cohen playing Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This shouldn't be funny, but it is and we're all going to tell for laughing at it...
Anyone wanna carpool?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is EXACTLY what is missing from Hollywood. Creativity with no limits.
tL4McUzXfFI,I believe that this kid was Rudol Von Strohiem's son 🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,0/10 SpeedWagon is not in this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Stand name: der fuhrer
tL4McUzXfFI,DOITSU NO KAGAKU WA SEKAI ICHI
tL4McUzXfFI,Evil Charlie Chaplin is so much fun😅
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is what Part 9 looks like
tL4McUzXfFI,"German boy from the Hitler Youth discovers his mother has been hiding a Jewish girl in the attack and falls in love with her?

This is blatant #Plagiarism of the book Caging Skies by Christine Leunens ... which is about the level of integrity I would expect from an outspoken racist who HATES White people, like Taika Waititi."
tL4McUzXfFI,laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangweilig... als gäbe es in der us geschichte nicht genug BS den man mal verfilmen könnte....
tL4McUzXfFI,All the Jews are hating on this movie so much
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't tink I an handle this if this has one of those bitter sweet ending.
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does Scarlett Johansson keep taking Asian people’s parts?
tL4McUzXfFI,Moonrise Kingdom vibes
tL4McUzXfFI,Any germans know if they'll be able to watch this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Best movie in 20 years !!!! A genius who seems even bigger than Mel brooks at mixing Drama & comedy,,,,"
tL4McUzXfFI,I always love a movie that isn’t afraid to show Uncle Addie’s Peace Windmill
tL4McUzXfFI,This Joestar comes from a hidden affair between Jorge Joestar and Stronhiem.
tL4McUzXfFI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOF8RUbbUo0 heres one of the songs ^^
tL4McUzXfFI,Could use subtitles...? Closed captions?
tL4McUzXfFI,Why was this on muselks Minecraft playlist?
tL4McUzXfFI,Sounds like antifa
tL4McUzXfFI,I did nazi this coming.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I mean, all the worlds a stage and historys major players merely actors on it, but this looks like a super fun movie all the same. Blockheads."
tL4McUzXfFI,is this a speedwagon reference
tL4McUzXfFI,"Im not sure how accurate this movie is but it looks good 


also please tell me if there was a nazi unit that dressed like that 1:23"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is like it could be a fun and interesting dark comedy. Listen kid it's never a good time to be a Nazi.
tL4McUzXfFI,Alternative ending: This just in Winston Churchill burns down German boys house
tL4McUzXfFI,Live action Jojo bizarre adventure looks good but witch Jojo is it
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait for this
tL4McUzXfFI,"I thought the concept was silly but after seeing the trailer, it looks amazing."
tL4McUzXfFI,Count Dankula: the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"The question is, would Bowie want his song 'heroes' in a Nazi movie?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"“It’s definitely not a good time to be a Nazi”
Bruh, we gotchu, just come to 2019

...

:("
tL4McUzXfFI,"You though it was Hitler... But it's ME! DIO!!!!!
JoJo - Hitler's Bizarre Adventure"
tL4McUzXfFI,I think we should be Protesting that Scarlet Johansson is playing a role that could have been played by a German Mother ? I mean if they want to protest that she was playing a Trans man shouldn't we protest this too ? I'm certain there are plenty of Actors who are mothers and are German that could have played this role. Shame On you Hollywood !
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,מי ישראלי?
tL4McUzXfFI,Where is JOJO?
tL4McUzXfFI,Does anyone else get oddly emotional from this???
tL4McUzXfFI,is that a jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,And the whining on Twitter from some purple haired chicks starts about........now.
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally I can watch jojos bizzare adventure with a nazi new zealander and a black widow who died for a stone in one movie ThIs Is My TyPe Of MoViE
tL4McUzXfFI,Erwin Rommel's son
tL4McUzXfFI,You thought it was jojo no it was me HITLER
tL4McUzXfFI,Those Israel are so desperate that they have to bring children to their propaganda. No we don't hate Jews. Yes we hate Israel whose murdered Palestines more than Nazi. NEEEEXXT!
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks fucking amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler before
The most hated insane dictator in the world
Hitler now
The most loved friendly and hilariously funny dictator"
tL4McUzXfFI,Joseph Joestar : OH MY GOD!!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,I just like how this song reminds me of regular show
tL4McUzXfFI,Okay
tL4McUzXfFI,This is awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,LOL it was made by a Nz dude i love him now

tL4McUzXfFI,cant wait
tL4McUzXfFI,"One problem I have with this is that they can't decide if they want to do a fake German accent or not. Some do, some don't and SJ just seems to keep switching it."
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
tL4McUzXfFI,"germany: why do i hear piano music
ussr:  I, comrade Ivan, have a dream"
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo's Bizarre Adventure part 9 is looking wild.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow this is triggering to both nazis and  liberals, never thought I’d see the day where those idiots agree on something."
tL4McUzXfFI,What if hitler is the side of jojo that is sully devoted the nazi cause
tL4McUzXfFI,What is that second song
tL4McUzXfFI,冷知识：切勿低估昆虫的力量，小小的蚂蚁能搬动相当于自身重量50倍重的东西。当把一只强健的蜜蜂栓到带有轮子的物体上时，它可以拉动相当于自身重量300倍的东西。
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh god, think of all the meme formats that will come from this"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,Now this is a movie worth seeing.
tL4McUzXfFI,was this movie renamed? I really do think it had a def name a few weeks back.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Видели бы Деды которые воевали против нацизма,  что щас творится. Я отношусь к разному юмору спокойно но когда из ""Нацистов"" делают милых и добрых пони.. Это уже перебор. Это убийцы которые погубили миллионы ничем не повинных  людей !"
tL4McUzXfFI,Stalin must be in this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Do you know what I am? Say it! A Jew. Gesuntheit.
That is lmfao!
Is it time to say its ok to laugh at the idiocy of Hitler despite the evil within? You cant even mention him in Germany without being prosecuted, read Mein Kamf so you can understand how evil he was.....but i digress.

If you don't know about Taika, please check out these films....what we do in the shadows, Boy, hunt for the wilder people, eagle vs shark,Thor ragnoron. 
Too much cringe fun with kiwi accents 😆"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this Stroheim's origin story?
tL4McUzXfFI,Hahahahaha this is so funnnyyy🤣🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,I feel like the setting is kinda sensitive but tbh this movie looks really funny
tL4McUzXfFI,*Huh Neat*
tL4McUzXfFI,The depiction of my führer is spot on good job fox
tL4McUzXfFI,Jewish propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,No and no
tL4McUzXfFI,Fun fact: That German version of Heroes was sung by Bowie himself. The whole album was recorded in Germany and he decided to make a German version.
tL4McUzXfFI,"lol, looks great. Reminds me of 'The Death of Stalin'."
tL4McUzXfFI,When are we getting a Japanese jojo rabbit
tL4McUzXfFI,Best nazi movie since Springtime With Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,"Those Nazi’s and their desire to preserve German genetics! 

Jews: absolutely shocking and totally immoral, but let’s create our own state with permanent citizenship only granted to those that have a pure Jewish genetic line 😏"
tL4McUzXfFI,Maybe all those silly little kids in AntiFa should sit and watch this film..Its message couldn't be better timed seeing what's happening today..
tL4McUzXfFI,This is awkwardly uncomfortable for many reasons.
tL4McUzXfFI,Appears to be springtime for Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,CRAZY HORSES!
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or does the little boy who drops the rocket launcher look just like Nick Frost?
tL4McUzXfFI,Villager noise
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't care how cute you make the devil look he's still the devil. Nice try liberals.
tL4McUzXfFI,DOITSU NO KAGAKU WA SEKAI ICHI!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,wow this movie looks brilliant already.  Taika is looking more and more like the next Quinten Tarantino.  Its liek Inglorious Bastards for kids.

“The past is never dead. It's not even past.” “I define my journey, I enjoy it too.” “One of the most difficult things to think about in life is one's regrets. Something will happen to you, and you will do the wrong thing, and for years afterward you will wish you had done something different.” “Don't you love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies. I would send you a bouquet of newly sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address.” “Love the trees"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Scarlett Johansson Windsor is a nazi and not the ethnicities she says. Those families and their kind lie. When she takes off her suit it is not a normal human. It is similar to who is in the Inglourious Basterds film. All of them are nazi descendants and active members. This is common in Hollywood and they call themselves Jewish, but they were not even Germanic Jews or from anywhere else.

Black Widow was cancelled before in 2008-2011 because Scarlett Johansson Windsor was making crush videos and you can clearly see her face in a few. She and Angelina Jolie Windsor also made '2 girls one cup' videos (do not watch those) with each other, Tom Cruise Windsor Rothschild and children. It is disgusting. The investors kind of gave her discipline but now they are rewarding her since nazis own Disney and all of the other companies. Law enforcement, lawyers and the judicial system know about this stuff and nothing has been done. A few people were blocked.

When Scarlett Johansson Windsor or Demi Lovato have child pornography on their devices and are taking pictures of children it does not matter what those children are or why the kids are there. Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. have been smiling and laughing with blood around their mouths and boys penises missing. They apparently have to use a catheter for the rest of their lives. People, law enforcement, lawyers, the investors, the scientologists, etc know about and nothing has been done. A few wanted to do something but were blocked. Drake Aubrey Windsor Rothschild has also been involved and got copies of many pictures and videos. It makes no sense that anybody wants these pieces of garbage around. This was at Comet Ping Pong and Besta Pizza with the tunnels underneath the businesses and the torture chambers. People were seen eating in those pictures on the other side of the glass during the day and during parties.

Scarlett Johansson Windsor is #pizzagate, #hotdoggate, #pedogate, #rapegate, #crushvideogate, #bestialitygate, #nazigate and #aidsgate. She pretends she represents the gay community but has given people aids and their families made it or modified it with the injections."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I've always said, Nazi's = Hilarity."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is Gona be big protest it s not appropriate too many people died in WWII!
tL4McUzXfFI,What a good little Nazi.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Fuck you the rest of the world I'm Jewish, I'm living in Israel and i really want to see this movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF
tL4McUzXfFI,is that abigail breslin's little sister or what
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yes finally a movie about nazi and not about American beating nazi that just too old now.


Edit: oh yes before I watch the movie I must make sure I’m not in a Jewish theaters"
tL4McUzXfFI,A Nazi film MAKING FUN OF NAZIS! YEAH THATS SOME REAL SATIRE.
tL4McUzXfFI,This actually makes Hitler funny
tL4McUzXfFI,Propaganda at its finest  And yet they never made a movie about the communist I wonder why
tL4McUzXfFI,Boomers really out here calling this 'sjw Jew propaganda' lmao
tL4McUzXfFI,A nice video on today's youtube skeptic community and their alt-right friendies.
tL4McUzXfFI,This isn't JoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks fun asf
tL4McUzXfFI,"*Taika* : im telling you!!!! its based on a book that based on a film that based on a video game from the 17th century! 
*disney* : so its not a an original work? fine we will give you budget. 
*Taika* : haha suckers!!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,I swear this director can make any crazy idea work.
tL4McUzXfFI,"6,845 movies about nazis but 0 on the holodomor. I wonder why..."
tL4McUzXfFI,The music are ‘I am a believer’ from the Monkees and ‘Heroes’ from David Bowie. Both German version.
tL4McUzXfFI,I think this will be the first time my grandparents will not allow me to watch a family friendly movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally I can watch jojos bizzare adventure with a nazi new zealander and a black widow who died for a stone in one movie


ThIs Is My TyPe Of MoViE"
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is the fabled part 9 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I have to say that Araki made a weird choice with making this part's JoJo have a Stand based on Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,I really hope they do Adolf justice in this one
tL4McUzXfFI,So what the point of calling him jojo rabbit?
tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t watch this trailer without thinking of regular show
tL4McUzXfFI,Most comments have something to do with jjba
tL4McUzXfFI,"Protagonist’s name is jojo, he has an “imaginary friend”. This is a jojo reference"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yes Hollywood, lecture me on history and morals under the disguise of humor and muh moral compass"

tL4McUzXfFI,*So Hitler didn't Die he just become his Imaginary Friend*
tL4McUzXfFI,Brings out piano. Time for GORINO'S THEME BOYS
tL4McUzXfFI,"For a film with Jojo in its name and this dude having Hitler as a stand, I mean..."
tL4McUzXfFI,Now I like Nazis even more
tL4McUzXfFI,Hmmmmmmmmmmm maybe....maybe
tL4McUzXfFI,"Can we talk about the fact that DISNEY is making this movie happen? It's like when they made that one Nazi propaganda cartoon. You'd think in an age where we're pretty much not fighting Nazis anymore, we'd have moved past this kind of thing.



But I low key want to see it because I know it'll be a total train wreck."
tL4McUzXfFI,B
tL4McUzXfFI,Tookie Waitata outdoing himself yet again.
tL4McUzXfFI,The times we are living in right now are exactly why we need movies like this. It makes you realize how childishly absurd and unfounded the hate from the extreme right is and why also you must take it seriously. I can’t wait to see this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,prequel : Before Joseph & Jotaro Timeline
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this another desperate attempt to dirty conservatism? 🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,German science is the world's finest!
tL4McUzXfFI,Gay
tL4McUzXfFI,What’s the name of the song that plays after he finds the Jewish girl
tL4McUzXfFI,So when pewdiepie made a hitler joke box did multiple articles but when Fox does it a a great movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"First few seconds I thought it was a boy scout movie, then hitler arrived"
tL4McUzXfFI,What they said ⏬
tL4McUzXfFI,They better have a jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t wait to see it
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler????
tL4McUzXfFI,"After 70 years they cant stop bashin dead christian men. After 70 years its still the same old evil nazi this, evil nazi that. If you talk ugly about something long enough, people will start to question why so much ugly talk, and then poof, the matrix disappears..."
tL4McUzXfFI,"So this movie is the boy in the striped supreme                                 

das ist schön"
tL4McUzXfFI,"You really gotta appreciate the details. Smash Mouth's ""I'm a Believer"" and Bowie's ""Heroes"" in German"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it bad that I want to see this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,THIS MOVIE IS A NAZI MOVIE I HOPE IT FLOPS IN THE BOX OFFICE THEY SHOULD BOYCOTT IT
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks absolutely hilarious.
tL4McUzXfFI,Rudol von Stroheim’s past
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like Wes Anderson suggested Color pallets for this
tL4McUzXfFI,jewish propaganda at its finest
tL4McUzXfFI,Where's Stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,Im getting Moonrise Kingdom vibes and I LOVE IT
tL4McUzXfFI,"Another Jew movie made by Jews starring Jews during WW2 so therefore going to be entirely inaccurate!! I wonder though if they’re going to put the wooden doors in this film??
🔥🛶🔥"
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika as an imaginary Hitler... This is going to be hilarious!
tL4McUzXfFI,Mad Lads: the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Every downvote is a badge of distinction. I will see this in theaters to support true comedy, like this."

tL4McUzXfFI,Ironic considering Pewdiepie wouldve gotten murdered for this 2 years ago
tL4McUzXfFI,2:09 Is Hitler eating that unicorn? He was a vegetarian but I guess this one's different because this Hitler JoJo's imaginary friend.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is gonna be good movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika and Bowie... omg im doneeeeeeeeeeee
tL4McUzXfFI,"I can't wait for this. the ""what? Of course you can"" gets me every time😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,Bruh when Hitler leaned down and said “What? Of course you can!” It went from semi interesting to unreal :0
tL4McUzXfFI,Did Mel Brooks have anything to do with this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Taika Waititi, the Mel Brooks of modern cinema."
tL4McUzXfFI,"ITS THAT, A MOTHERFUCKING.... nazi reference?"

tL4McUzXfFI,Burn the house down and blame Winston
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks entertaining
tL4McUzXfFI,I haven't seen it. I wonder if it's as good as the death of Stalin.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Is this a







You fell for it fool
Thunder cross split attack"
tL4McUzXfFI,What a bizarre adventure.
tL4McUzXfFI,Really hope this brings that mustache back in style. Chaplin would love this guy.
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does this exist.
tL4McUzXfFI,ITS JOJO
tL4McUzXfFI,Why are they making Hitler out to be goofy and adorable? 🤔
tL4McUzXfFI,"*Protagonist is called Jojo*
*Has an imaginary friend always beside him*


Ok, it's seriously impossible to say that the show creator didn't want to reference Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. I mean, what German boy is even called Jojo?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is this in muselks Minecraft playlist
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Got it! We will burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill!..... Or Negotiate.""

This movie is comedy gold from just the trailer alone."
tL4McUzXfFI,And I thought the sonic movie was bad. WTF
tL4McUzXfFI,"Guarantee some fucked up commie is gonna shoot up a theatre when this comes out, just wait and see"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does the kid at the end have the most British accent 🇬🇧
tL4McUzXfFI,ФУ
tL4McUzXfFI,oi josuke
tL4McUzXfFI,"With  imaginary friends like that , who needs enemies?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Still this movie is made to ridicule and guilt-trip Germans and white people. What would be real edgy and woke would be a movie of zionist Israel.
tL4McUzXfFI,"So let me get this straight, a comedy about Nazis and World War 11...wow...we have digressed so far as a  society. I don't see anything remotely amusing or funny about this. The sad thing is, the younger generations will never have the slightest understanding of what happened in world war two. Not amused."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Joker, Chappelle, and Jo Jo. Seeing a pattern here..."

tL4McUzXfFI,SHAME ON YOU !!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh this movie’s gonna one hell of a rollercoaster

It’s only made better by the German version of I’m A Believer in the background"
tL4McUzXfFI,Stalin was funniest and dumber.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Those Nazis were such a fun loving group as we all know. 
Whoever approved this is utterly tone deaf ......"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Y'all are making idiotic comments here like this isn't a Taika Waititi movie making fun of Nazis. Let us repeat it together:
""IT'S A TAIKA WAITITI MOVIE MAKING FUN OF NAZIS""

And yes, Disney supports anything Taika does, get over it. He's worked with them since Moana."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait is this a real movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,"im gonna see this over Cuck the movie, especially since its just the soy version of american history x"
tL4McUzXfFI,So why do we keep making movies about the Jewish genocide but not one movie on the Armenian genocide?
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok what kind of mushrooms did they ate to come up with this?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nobody: 
Fox: let’s make a controversial movie that will probably piss a lot of people off."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really funny and that's saying something because I'm Jewish
tL4McUzXfFI,LOL to the triggered far-left and far-right nutjobs on the comments section
tL4McUzXfFI,Why are comments from 1 day ago getting over 1k likes? And replies to those comments saying the simplest things getting over 100 likes?

tL4McUzXfFI,A film where a rabid female Jew manipulates a European kid to hate his country and his own kind? Fantasy film or reality.

tL4McUzXfFI,“They look just like us” lol
tL4McUzXfFI,What wolfenstein youngblood should've been...
tL4McUzXfFI,You thought it was Stalin but it was me Dio the whole time!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Now there's ""very fine people on both sides!"", but remember before Trump got elected when saying ""Nazis are bad"" wasn't controversial?  I miss those days.."
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is no one talking about how good this movie looks
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yeah I’m not going to see this.   


Also, does rebel Wilson have some leverage on movie directors, some way to blackmail them, and that’s why she keeps getting roles? 

She ruined pitch perfect three.   And she isn’t funny!"
tL4McUzXfFI,can we get this song just by its self

tL4McUzXfFI,The accents suck
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika waititi is a meme lord that makes memes in a movie format.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so stupid. Just stop turning Hitler into a comedy. His crimes & platforms were never funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,"i tought it was a movie the jojo the rabbit, an adaptation from the children books"
tL4McUzXfFI,Yay. Make Nazis funny
tL4McUzXfFI,This is how you make a shit post movie
tL4McUzXfFI,lol the simulation broken
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is a comedy rite?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Waiting for the backlash and the ""You're a nazi you dont agree with me"" drama."
tL4McUzXfFI,I expected: SONO CHINO SADAME JOOOOOOOOOOOOOJOOOO!!!!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF is this shit. Total trash
tL4McUzXfFI,"The folks making this movie have some serious balls, props to them 👍"
tL4McUzXfFI,"We don't say Gesündheit.... It's a simple u, guys."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wo is the song?
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow. Kinda feeding yourselves the Nazi narrative. So I guess this now proves Nazis are everywhere OR this is just a way to divide people as usual.
tL4McUzXfFI,Mother fuhrer lol
tL4McUzXfFI,Je veux les videos
tL4McUzXfFI,This is exactly what we needed.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is exactly what we needed.
tL4McUzXfFI,I guarantee either the Director or the cast has ties to white nationalists trashy movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh dear. This movie shouldn’t be touched with a ten foot pole. Give it a couple more days and everyone and their grandparents are going to find something offensive about it. Which there is, some things should never be made light of. Even if that’s the idea, that’ll just make it worse."
tL4McUzXfFI,But will Thor make a cameo?
tL4McUzXfFI,5.7k Nazis dislike this trailer.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Everyone in the comments making Jojo's Bizzare Adventure References, and I'm just here jamming to that German ""Heroes"" cover. Hearing Bowie's German period sung in German is pretty surreal."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks freakin'n insane XD
tL4McUzXfFI,Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as child
tL4McUzXfFI,It looks like a Wes Anderson movie  ….. only is funny and worth watching.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Welp, this looks AMAZING!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,FOR STROHEIM!
tL4McUzXfFI,"It looks entertaining, but WTF?"
tL4McUzXfFI,I still hear korg 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Так блэт что это за джоджо?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler: that was intense

Me: I feel you don't see the irony in that statement"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks hilarious. Also seems to highlight how everyday normal people can be pulled down such a path to support something like Nazism or Communism
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a Jewish trick
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is this in Muselk’s minecraft playlist?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Honestly you guys gotta calm down. It's a comedy. 

It's making fun of the Nazis and how they systematically manipulated the youth with propaganda and the Hitler Youth.

Edit: I'm Jewish"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do predict Scar Jo being the only one to get any hate for this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,*GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD*

tL4McUzXfFI,This is not a jojo reference!
tL4McUzXfFI,The most offensive thing is david bowie in german
tL4McUzXfFI,Apparently Disney is even giving Ededucation For Death a live action remake.
tL4McUzXfFI,People are probably gonna be angry at this film just for depicting nazism even if it doesn't promote it.

tL4McUzXfFI,I can smell Disney's fear from here.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'll be surprised if this isn't controversial.  I am admittedly kind of over directors using the ww2 setting. Like there have been two wars since, maybe with more boring characters, but I think we should let Hitler's name and image burn into forgotten history.  Looks great from a film perspective though."
tL4McUzXfFI,Were the jews the good guys in WW2?

tL4McUzXfFI,This is offensive to Nazis😡😡🤬🤬
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally! A movie that trivialises the atrocities of Nazism by wrapping it up in a family friendly style.

Millions of people died at their hands. There’s nothing funny about that. 

What’s next, a ‘parody’ of the Witchfinder Generals? There’s already been one about Josef Stalin which trivialised his brutal regime that killed millions of Soviet citizens."

tL4McUzXfFI,Standmaster: Jojo  [Stand] Adolf Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,i think this will be banned in germany
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don’t know why but for me it seems like between 1:39 to about 1:43 shit gets dark for a minute. You have the Germans clearly under attack, Jojo saying he’s a bad guy, the US Army boutta fucking role up on someone and the Girl tipping him saying he’s not like the others. Seems like by the end of the film we could definitely be seeing things turn south for Jojo’s side of the war."

tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like the most heartwarming and funny movie of 2019 is going to be about the Hitlerjugend... Yay
tL4McUzXfFI,See history is always half true from one side they killed and tried to destroy the world but from their side it was happy times🤦🏾‍♂️

tL4McUzXfFI,Von Stroheim's Back story
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is the most fucked up stupid thing I’ve ever seen. It’s hard to fathom how this is a real movie. Who would pay to see this shit? My God, what the hell are you doing  Scarlet Johansson? These kinds of role choices end careers."
tL4McUzXfFI,What is the song?

tL4McUzXfFI,"Question: Will this even be allowed to be released in Germany
If not
I'm so sorry that you guys gotta miss out"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Notice no ""SJW outrage"" on this one? That's because it's a smart satire, not empty pandering for shock value."

im out of jojo jokes"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie kills me everytime i see the trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure’s
tL4McUzXfFI,"I love history. My shelves are filled with European history books from 1900-1950, specifically Russian/Soviet history. And even within that very brief period there’s sooooo much material to focus on. The Hitler/Nazi movies and documentaries are beyond uninteresting at this point. It’s like mowing the same same 4 x 4 patch of grass in a 100 acre field over, and over, and over, and over, and over... at the expense of the rest of the land. We all GET IT. Now let’s explore the hundreds of other interesting, moving, and consequential periods in history."
tL4McUzXfFI,whats the outro song
tL4McUzXfFI,So it's basically a parody based on today's clueless liberal fascists. Hollywood is going to love it!
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s all fun and games until the gestapo bust down the door
tL4McUzXfFI,Me: The perfect movie doesn't exis.......
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm probably gonna pirate this. BUT I'LL BE GOOD FOR ONCE AND ACTUALLY TRY TO FIND AN ORIGINAL COPY! (sorry, I live in a 3rd world country where people sometimes think Germans and Jews are the same people...)"
tL4McUzXfFI,I can already tell this is going to an insane movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Republicans and Democrats remember Hitler was able to brainwash everyday Germans to turn a blind eye to mass murder without the power of the internet or big business propaganda platforms like cnn and Fox News. Live above the influence republicans and democrats we need more free thinkers not brainwashed propaganda puppets like yourselves!
tL4McUzXfFI,"“Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Adolf. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm little antisemitic. But don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid, unless you have a bad juju. Just a little holocaust joke for you."""

tL4McUzXfFI,"When it comes to movies about historical events, I expect and them to be as accurate as possible. 

But thumbnail tells me that it's a satirical comedy that should not be taken seriously. I so hope it pisses sjws off for added humor"
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika is so weird and annoying.  And I hated Thor Ragnarok too!!  The trailer was amazing but the actual movie was lame with very bad comedy.  And he is going to write and direct the next Thor movie!!!  God help us all!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Ban?
tL4McUzXfFI,This is why Pucci reseted the universe
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ok we got a JOJO, now whats his stand and where is Dio?"

Worker: ""Hey, guys, lets make a movie about a kid nazi who's imaginary friend is Hitler and he's at a camp or something""

Boss: ""Marvin you are a genius"""
tL4McUzXfFI,A german actor should play hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,If Stalin is in this movie it will be the best movie ever
tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m a Jew, we can indeed read each other’s minds"

tL4McUzXfFI,Watch out for furries guys!..
tL4McUzXfFI,Normalizing empathy for the Nazis and Facism thanks America
tL4McUzXfFI,Hope the media doesn't get offended by this
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to be amazing. As a man with German ancestry. I endorse this movie. Too bad that it will probably piss off a lot of people in Germany and more than likely will not be played in Germany because they just... yeah. If it does get shown in theaters in Germany. I will commend them and that will be a big step forward in how they address that time period. Thank you Rammstein for not being so blind.
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone else waiting for the Jews to freak the fuk out? I mean they are perpetually offended after all.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Looks like this boy is gonna go through a bizarre adevnture...





This comment's user has been fatally shot 38 times, shortly after typing the previous sentence. If you have any whereabouts/information of why and who killed this man do not hesitate to notify the Detroit Police. Thank you."
tL4McUzXfFI,i think this movie might be anti-semitic
tL4McUzXfFI,Love the bowie!
tL4McUzXfFI,This seems like a pretty alright movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"A movie for the nazi’s



Me hate nazi’s so I say get noobed to them"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Meanwhile

tL4McUzXfFI,I'm jealous for the history classes of the future who will watch this in school in

tL4McUzXfFI,This is not jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,Please...  PLEASE let this be an amazing movie!!
tL4McUzXfFI,That looks like it would be a lot of fun lmao.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just so you all know, Hitler was very very very far from the worst dictator in mankind. He killed 6 Million Jews, Stalin killed 30 Million people about a third was Jewish so about 10 million killed by Stalin. And Mao Zedong killed between 35-70 million people. But we hear everyone calling each other Nazi's like they were the worst. Communism and Socialism killed more people than hitler ever did. Ok? Ok.

Feel free to blast me with your Politically Correct BS but that is straight facts can't argue with that"
tL4McUzXfFI,I kinda wish this was rated R
tL4McUzXfFI,This actually seems like a good movie holy shit
tL4McUzXfFI,So does the Imperial Japanese version have Jotaro?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Going to theorize that Black widow was time traveled back to the 40's and the red skull is part o her imagination. However Red skull is able to interact wih Jojo's imaginary hitler, Red Skull telling him how he destroyed everything  only for Hitler to be oblivious as the bombs rain down."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Liberals are gonna rant and scream about this one, gomna be good."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stil not a good time to be a Nazi, but communism is on the rise."
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s funny how his imaginary hitler/friend  is a happy and young looking man
tL4McUzXfFI,Im from poland and i am not angry so i think that i have distanse to myself and i think hitler will be one of my favourite movie charakteres.yea im from poland
tL4McUzXfFI,So it’s The Book Thief plus Boy In Striped Pajamas... plus Calvin and Hobbes... but it’s a comedy? Alrighty then
tL4McUzXfFI,if I could get 0:16-0:22 made into a gif that be great
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this pg pg13 or rated r
tL4McUzXfFI,This is cancer. The director is call (((Cohen))). 🔯🔜⛽
tL4McUzXfFI,Now is hitler in his head or is he actually with him? If its the latter then it cant be hitler as theres no pineapple.
tL4McUzXfFI,I did Nazi this coming.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nothing funny about Nazis in time of Trump, very scary. Churchill said ""Keep England white"" and ""Bolshevik were Jewish"" . Churchill is another Trump.
Impeach Trump"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks funny as fuck I cannot lie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Omg this looks fucking great!!
tL4McUzXfFI,I wanna watch this movie so bad
tL4McUzXfFI,"Okay, I'm watching this with my dad."
tL4McUzXfFI,I’ve never seen a person suit the role of a SS Officer more than Steven Merchant
tL4McUzXfFI,*Burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill*

tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Woketitis
tL4McUzXfFI,20thFOX'SS
tL4McUzXfFI,Was that a Jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Imagine having an original idea for a movie with a child named Jojo and the most powerful stand wielding community of the entire internet invades your comment section.
BRRRRRRAAAAAKA MONOGA"
tL4McUzXfFI,I was not expecting this.
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo has Hitler as a Stand.
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie looks SO GOOD! Count me in!
tL4McUzXfFI,"🤢this is making me uncomfortable, i couldn't even finish it. Can Hollywood stop making ""parodies"" about Hitler and making people view him as funny guy?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I love this moive so much
tL4McUzXfFI,"An American should make a movie like this but replace Hitler with a bloated, loud-mouthed, orange-faced man with weird hair"
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s ironic how Scarlett Johansson’s mom is Jewish and she is playing a nazi in a movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Achoo""
""Gesundheit"" 😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks so good I can't wait to go see it. From the looks of it, the Imaginary Hitler is going to represent the Nazi in JoJo, in a way. One side of him si the 10-year-old boy, while the other wants to be a Nazi and fit in with the crowd, which is why his imaginary Hitler gets angry about his opinion on the Jewish girl. He's conflicted about what he wants to do and what he thinks is right. I absolutely cannot wait for this film!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Has Better Love Story than Twilight
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or does hitler look wholesome in this
tL4McUzXfFI,"This trailer is so ""Wes Anderson"" that I just assumed it was his next movie.  Hope it is a good movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Я думал найти здесь жожо, но не фашистов. Где мой жожо? Это все проклятый дио"
tL4McUzXfFI,Just wow. God dam jews.
tL4McUzXfFI,I can't believe how good this movie looks. This might be the first movie I see in the theatre the day it comes out.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jajaja genial
tL4McUzXfFI,Bullshit begins in Bollywood
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it bad if I want to see this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Bagus s
tL4McUzXfFI,The Stroheim back story
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy crap! A movie in 2019 with ACTUAL swastikas?! TAKE MY MONEY
tL4McUzXfFI,"so basically a nazi moonrise kingdom? ok, i'll watch it"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hmm...something tells me this won’t be a blockbuster....
tL4McUzXfFI,Now fans of this movie can say hail hitler in public
tL4McUzXfFI,"Fox: hey, you know how Germany established such an oppressive military state that they indoctrinated hundreds of innocent children into turning in their own parents for speaking against the national socialism party and led to the deep divide in trust among the people?

Me: yeah?


Fox: let’s make it into a comedy, it’ll be funny."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a ballsy movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,What is the song in the background?
tL4McUzXfFI,Heavy Cringe...
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm here just for JOJO in the title
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nazis were bad but the British empire was the absolute worst. The Nazis just cannot hold a candle to the British when it comes to racism, slavery and genocides. More Russians were killed in world war 2 than Americans and Brits but I don't see Russians making anti-Nazi films. The Brits and the Americans showcase themselves to be the real heroes of the war when the truth is it was the Russians who actually won the war and ended Nazi Germany's expansionism."
tL4McUzXfFI,"The Germans made Nazism and they make it a joke , millions of victims fall down in graves.
Jews always screaming when someone show swastika where are they now ????? 
Where is Holocaust Factory of Abraham Foxman now ????
This make me sick."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I gatta tell you guys, I fucking laughed my ass off when I theought about how the Soviets would be in this universe, they would be the fucking best😂"

what a hypocrisy this is pure Woke movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,"*Sees this in recommended*


Didn't expect the Third Reich to show up."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks a little like a Wes Anderson movie
tL4McUzXfFI,I want this
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't know how I should feel about this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"My brain can’t process this. The trailer finished 5 mins ago and I’m still staring at my screen, I think I need medical attention."
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought this was a reference to Lucky Star
tL4McUzXfFI,grand budapest hotel style
tL4McUzXfFI,I was hoping for the first Jostar family movie
tL4McUzXfFI,All those thumbs down are from the Jews that didn't get a penny off the film
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't expect the third reich to show up...
tL4McUzXfFI,"So I guess it's finally no longer ""too soon""? 😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this legitimately a JoJo Nazi movies!?!?!
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF? Normalizing our enemies? Hollywood is a bunch of traitors!
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a softboy movie

tL4McUzXfFI,This is fucking amazing the music is bloody funny
tL4McUzXfFI,i regret seeing the second half of this trailer. i think that spoils the movie. regardless i will try to see the movei

tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo's bizzare adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,I must have watched this trailer 6 million times!
tL4McUzXfFI,"So, uh, did your focus groups find that nazis and the word JOJO are massively appealing to 13 year olds on the internet? Or is this actually a title someone came up with by themselves?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't like what the Government did...oops Illuminati...oops the Nazis did, I feel like this movie is making fun of them sorta. Looks funny, not sure if I'll watch it"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do white people love Nazis? Out of all the people in history I don’t get it.

tL4McUzXfFI,Cant be slower than the Pianist
tL4McUzXfFI,"Fox: We need something original. People are complaining about all the sequels.
Taika: Hold my Bier"
tL4McUzXfFI,Making lite of this makes me sick. You have cheapened all the life's that were lost.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, a Nazi JoJo. I wonder what his stand would be..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I was so confused if this was a comedy or based off of real life until I read the description.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm sorry but,
I'm actually freaking excited for this movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,Thats an bizare adventure that JoJo kid is on

tL4McUzXfFI,"I hope imaginary friend Hitler yells ""Fegeline!"" when he's pissed."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I think I want to see it, because it's so goddamn original. Not keen on the 2 hrs of indoctrination I'm sure the film has. But the trailer makes it look like a fun movie, from the perspective of the enemy. That seems oddly fun."
tL4McUzXfFI,And now this is happening......😮🤭😑🇨🇦

tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo and nazis?? IS THAT A MOTHERFOOKIN JOJO REFERENCE??? @#!&!?
tL4McUzXfFI,A movie that finally shows why George Soros became a Nazi collaborator.
tL4McUzXfFI,So the new jojo is some nazi...pucci should have never reset the universe
tL4McUzXfFI,Oi vey.
tL4McUzXfFI,Making fun of nazi's... nice

tL4McUzXfFI,Ahh this is amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,Im getting a strong wallflower theme here
tL4McUzXfFI,Wut.
tL4McUzXfFI,Why not just make this film a spin-off of Mel Brooks' To Be or Not to Be?
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh no.
tL4McUzXfFI,Actors love being politically correct unless there is a large sum of money to be made
tL4McUzXfFI,"Carvaleeoo,,, alguem me explica? Como que um filme pode mostrar essa história com algum humor???💆🏻‍♂️"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I love that the movie has the ability to turn something so dark in history/controversial subject that's taken seriously  
   Turned into the point of a child's perspective 
    A whole nother viewpoint 
Never thought I'd see movie like this but after inglorious basterds 
And the wolfenstein series 
  Anything is possible 



I'm more of a southerner 
   If they could do a antebellum/civil war era movie
 And involve the evils of slavery and the south's planter aristocracy 
 And make it light through the eyes of a child, I'd love to see that
  Maybe the child could make friends with a quadroon in New Orleans."

JoJo Fans:


I would like to reveal my curiosity towards the subject of a popularized Japanese animated television series that resembles the same name as this new cinematic experience and put to question if this is in any way referring to said popular Japanese television series of men that go on odd and quite bizarre adventures and such?"

Fun movie for the family 😁"
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought the director was wes anderson...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Strange how Hollywood keeps making films about Jews being discriminated against and killed in 40s Germany, they literally make at least one movie a year about this topic but they never talk about Palestinian kids being shot in the head and tormented daily while living in the world’s largest open air prison. Anyone else find this strange? Sort of hypocritical? They also haven’t made a film about the 700,000 Muslim women who were raped in Burma by soldiers using guns sold to them by Israel, mainly because every other country on earth refused to sell Burma weapons because they didn’t want to help this genocide. Funny how Hollywood is so selective in who they choose to humanize. Good news is that history has shown that what goes around, comes back around. God willing we will be around to witness the back around part."
tL4McUzXfFI,jojo rabbit is the better of the 3 jojos
tL4McUzXfFI,"Americans making fun of Nazis

tL4McUzXfFI,When will this come out in Germany?
tL4McUzXfFI,Burn it down and blame winstons churchill
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm sure german engineers are rolling in their graves at that panzershreck going off just by being dropped

tL4McUzXfFI,This ain't jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,I can't wait for this movie😂
tL4McUzXfFI,You should make a sequel that's the same thing pretty much but with Muslims. Their equally matched hatred of the Jews should allow for a seamless transition.
tL4McUzXfFI,Meanwhile  another JoJo is training with his mom and best friend in magical breathing to fight rock people with a cyborg nazi
tL4McUzXfFI,Your next line is “is that a Jojo reference “
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t know what it is about this trailer but I desperately want to watch this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Hey don't hate
tL4McUzXfFI,His stand is literally just Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,what songs plays in 1:17
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is garbage
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazis finally being portrayed as the happy golucky guys they really were.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Of course you'd need some populist shill like Johansson playing the objective and disillusioned ""lawful good"" character. Almost as if she wouldn't sacrifice her principles for comedic purposes, why her acting is so stiff and dreadful, and why she's an emotionless personality vacuum. Can't wait to yawn whenever she's on screen. 
Don't want to be the guy to bring historical accuracy into a satirical comedy, but nazification was so severe, that a kid wouldn't dare question if it was a good time to be a Nazi or not; because it always was. Or at least, that's what the ministry of propaganda was feeding them. If you want people to understand the actual seriousness of the tone you're setting underneath all that comedy and for the political climate Germans lived in at the time; because I'd assume sending that message was your intention given the circumstances; you need to believe that your main character is also subjected to that propaganda. The mothers character would be willingly sending her son off to Hitler youth, putting up pictures of Nazi propaganda all over the house, and painting Hitler as the ideal husband in her own head. Infact, it's a wonder she would be single at all in Nazi Germany without a man keeping her secure. As sexist as it sounds, and I assume feminism and strong independent women is their intention, she should be on the street or desperately trying to find a husband. Not making her own way in the upper echelons of Nazi society. Giving a woman so much power without earning it actually downplays the sacrifices they made to get there, and only hides the real challenges women faced not just in Germany, but other places around the world too. With something for the character to face and accept or challenge, it becomes their redemption story; rather than a one dimensional ""I'm a good guy now"" plot. Or maybe I'm looking too much into it and it really is just a movie for kids, which sends very mixed messages. 

Hold on a minute... I wonder how many parents will take their kids to see a comedy movie plastered in Nazi iconography? ""Mommy mommy, i wanna see that Nazi movie!"" 🤔"
tL4McUzXfFI,Was that heroes in german?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Cotton Hill has down voted this trailer 5,000 times"

tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait for the Fox Searchlight film where a very right wing young boy has Donald Trump as his imaginary friend.
tL4McUzXfFI,Just the fact that they played I’m a Believer in German made we watch this preview. It actually looks interesting. Something about the Nazis interests me for some reason.
tL4McUzXfFI,And Hitlerity ensues...
tL4McUzXfFI,The costume designer for this movie is on the FBIs and CIAs radar
tL4McUzXfFI,"1:14 Lol, does he have Hitler as an imaginary friend😂😂"

tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi kids blowing the door with a panzershrek rocket propelled launcher... count me in!
tL4McUzXfFI,"If i remember right Nazi youth camps would actually encourage the kids to have sex in an effort to further bolster Germanys population Hitler-Jugend and Bund Deutscher Mädel were youth programs in Germany. Both programs were heavily involved in outdoors activities,  HJ and BDM leaders coordinated campsite placement to be close to each other, to encourage their members to sneak off and have sex, in an effort to artificially raise the rate of births and create new family units birth control ads were banned, tax incentives were introduced for marriage and childbirth, and medals were commissioned for mothers of multiple children. At a rally at Nurenburg in 1936 the League of German Girls attended and 900 of the girls came back pregnant.
Richard Grunberger's book, The 12-Year Reich, also shows that ""a group of parents complained to the court that the leaders of the League were openly telling their daughters to have illegitimate children"". Nazis even went so far as to kidnap kids they deemed 'aryan' from Poland and ship them back to Germany to be raised there."

Taika Waititi makes a dark comedy (which looks AMAZING) about a Hitler youth with an imaginary adolf

I don’t want Taika arrested at all, but the UK has a weird way of policing humour. I’m still gonna see this movie, though."
tL4McUzXfFI,What the hell did I just watch...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh fuck another ""Jews are good guys"" movie"

tL4McUzXfFI,You tubers get their channels struck down and demonized for referencing these themes but this is ok for YouTube? I guess corporations are only allowed to be “edgy”
tL4McUzXfFI,I kinda like the second song anybody know what it's called?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah, das ist heiß, das ist heiß!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh I can't wait for the people comments who gets triggered (whine. hate, and complain) about this trailer/movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,2nd/3rd best movie of 2019 calling it right now you heard it from me
tL4McUzXfFI,What the fuck is going on here
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf did I just see?
tL4McUzXfFI,"A Nazi movie with pop music and comedy




I love it"
tL4McUzXfFI,Whoever is producing this has balls the size of Jupiter. Godspeed!
tL4McUzXfFI,"people from Soviet Russia, they disliked this video."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I always dreaded the consistant move to using war period for movies as it’s a reminder of such sadness and violence-even Inglorious Basterds. This however, I am really excited to watch!"
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is the fabled part 9 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.  I have to say that Araki made a weird choice with making this part's JoJo have a Stand based on Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Lmao, 2:01 had me dying"
tL4McUzXfFI,They could’ve casted me but I’m at the bottom of the Atlantic right now so......
tL4McUzXfFI,"I/you realized the first song playing on this trailer is a German version of “ I’m A Believer “
by Smash Mouth"
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder how that actor feels about playing Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,"100 times more likes than dislikes.
Success."
tL4McUzXfFI,BBBBRRRROOOOKOMONOGA!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks really cool. I was a little on the fence about before, but I'm definitely gonna see this now"
tL4McUzXfFI,Man JoJo part 6 is really fucking weird
tL4McUzXfFI,JOOOOOJOOOOO!
tL4McUzXfFI,Im bracing myself
tL4McUzXfFI,Those German covers of American and English bands give me serious Wolfenstein: New Order flashbacks 😆
tL4McUzXfFI,Delightfully distasteful. I love it.
tL4McUzXfFI,Whoever had the balls to get this greenlit needs to be knighted
tL4McUzXfFI,"Moonrise Kingdom meets Inglorious Bastards, now that’s a recipe for a good movie!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I want to see it, it seems funny. But the whole concept I just have mixed feelings about."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is fuckn hilarious
tL4McUzXfFI,Didn't know part9 was getting animated
tL4McUzXfFI,This isn’t the jojo movie I wanted
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, Wolfenstein: Youngblood looks great."
tL4McUzXfFI,So  Pete's Dragon but Elliot has a Nazi band and a tiny mustache
tL4McUzXfFI,Du beest eine FAruke!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yay more anti white propaganda about a war that ended 70+ years ago. My wife, her boyfriend and I cant wait to see this and CUCK the movie. Thanks jews"
tL4McUzXfFI,When i dressed up as a nazi they threw me out of disneyland. These guys get awards. Its one rule for them and dam the rest of us.
tL4McUzXfFI,They did good on the uniforms especially the HJ ones. But not at 1:24. I’m not exactly sure what you think about this movie either. Making a comedy on a edgy topic. Hmm
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika has to have some balls to make a nazi movie
tL4McUzXfFI,... I'm speechless I don't know what to say
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yeah no, I would prefer not to have a comedy as well as action movie on Nazi Germany. Especially not with hitler being a wAcKy side character."
tL4McUzXfFI,JJBA part 9 took an unexpected turn
tL4McUzXfFI,"This concept is bad enough but the fact that it's rated PG-13 which we all know much younger kids get taken to often makes it worse. I don't like the idea of depicting Hitler as a funny, benign, harmless doofus as a child's imaginary friend. Even if they weave in anti-Nazi humor the undertones & subtext is still there. It gives the children in the audience that can't process the ironic humor the impression that Hitler was this relatable goofy 'friend' caricature & not the real-life human being who was an actual harbinger of genocide, torture, and death that he was. Seriously, what do they plan on using as the marketing toys/niche items, Hitler action figures & Funko Pop!'s?? NO THANKS."
tL4McUzXfFI,Pixie!
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is it called Jojo rabbit?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m kind of a demirep, I really hope this triggers the SJWs"
tL4McUzXfFI,"So, October 18... are we getting Jojo costumes this year? Are they going to be acceptable?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Song?
tL4McUzXfFI,We need a WW II sitcom
tL4McUzXfFI,I dont get it.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I bet you when getting the actors for this movie, the staff asked waititi who should play Hitler, and Taika was like,” I would like to play Hitler “ XD"
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JO... oh wait no
tL4McUzXfFI,"This
Is
Hilarious."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Now let’s see if he can get away with making a movie about a Muslim with a imaginary Muhammad friend...
I would say Christian with an imaginary Jesus but sadly that plays out every day..."
tL4McUzXfFI,*its not a good time to be a nazi*
tL4McUzXfFI,This isn’t jojos bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,So this kid is a scout during ww2 and hitler is his imaginary friend and he is hiding a jew and has to keep it a secret or am i wrong
tL4McUzXfFI,"Korg : hey every one i am korg , this is jojo , and were gonna blow up some nazis , wanna come ?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"The funny thing is, this is a Disney movie since it was acquired by Fox who Disney owns"
tL4McUzXfFI,*_So This is why Scarlett Johansson is blonde in Infinity War_*
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a stupid way to represent the atrocities of war. Show this to the war vets
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Imagine being in the Hitler Youth and you hear you've got a ""special guest"" from the Party coming over.
And you've got your fingers crossed going ""please let it be Hitler please let it be Hitler""


And then he pops in halfway through the door, ""HI KIDS! Who wants to fire a howitzer!""


Best summer camp ever."
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok now this is a movie I will enjoy
tL4McUzXfFI,"In Scotland, mocking Nazis is a crime."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ever since ""The perks of being a wallflower"" Evey movie has been using David Bowie ""heroes""."
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo?
tL4McUzXfFI,Watch it while it last...... the ban wagon is comming........
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, I did Nazi this movie coming."
tL4McUzXfFI,did youtube recommend me this because of all the shameful jojo's bizarre adventure videos i have watched
tL4McUzXfFI,Omg 😍
tL4McUzXfFI,"Somebody please recut this with the Inglorious Bastards trailer, make into something crazy/funny/dark."
tL4McUzXfFI,This feels like a Wes Anderson movie without the Wes Andersoniness
tL4McUzXfFI,Why didn’t he kill the Jew girl on sight
tL4McUzXfFI,No! This is very wrong on so many levels. This should have never been made. Everybody boycott this movie. It's a reminder of somthing that needs to be forgotten for all time.8 million Jews died under the natzi regime and it's nothing to poke fun about. Fuck you all who think this is funny!🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
tL4McUzXfFI,"Instant first thought...director , is a fan of Wes Anderson and has probably seen Moonrise Kingdom 300 times. :P"
tL4McUzXfFI,Theon?!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,This will be either brilliant or terrible. I don't see it taking a middle road.
tL4McUzXfFI,Springtime for JoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,0:41 these dudes remind me of one of the guys from indiana jones raiders of the lost ark
tL4McUzXfFI,"Don’t get me wrong I love to laugh at nazis, however the double standard where count dankula can get fines and threat of imprisonment for teach a dog to raise its paw at “Gas the Jews” the comedy just becomes offensive as it relates to our current culture. Please at least pay homage to count dankula by putting a pug in the film please."
tL4McUzXfFI,This live action Jojo’s bizzare adventures movie is really tapping it down
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ugh this movie looks awful


Jojo doesn’t use a stand even once"
tL4McUzXfFI,The liberals are going to have heart attacks when they see this
tL4McUzXfFI,whos tf came up with this shit
tL4McUzXfFI,This is disgusting.
tL4McUzXfFI,100% gonna see this
tL4McUzXfFI,Beautiful
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t know if I should feel bad laughing at this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh look, Germans and Nazis are stupid clowns! This so edgy! Making fun of Germans and Nazis (but not Jews, hmm) has never been done before, ever! Not even by Jews like Mel Brooks...oh wait."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hirohiko Araki:*sees trailer*
Also Hirohiko Araki: * starts writing fanatically*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"*JoJo* Rabbit.


Hitler isn't his imaginary friend, he's his Stand."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hope this takes a nose dive at the box office, but seeing how fucked up the world is it won’t."
tL4McUzXfFI,So is Scarlett just the new Dwayne Johnson or something? She seems to be in EVERYTHING now.
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like a movie that will offend many people. I like it.
tL4McUzXfFI,"“You know what I am? Say it.”
“A Jew.”
“Gesundheit”
The writing is amazing."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a lovely wholesome family nazi movie
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks awful and to top it off it's got Rebel fucking Wilson in it.
tL4McUzXfFI,Let’s make Nazis loveable and stupid say no more
tL4McUzXfFI,amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,The balls of the director
tL4McUzXfFI,What is the age rating?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Honestly, when I first saw this I thought Hitler was Jojo's dad rather than an imaginary friend. Not sure which version I like more tbh."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it weird that I want to see this?
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this supposed to make Hitler child friendly ?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand master: Jojo
Stand name: Hitler"
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a Movie I can show my Whole BSA Troop.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait this isn't a JoJo reference.
tL4McUzXfFI,A movie about the rise of the Left.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow.  Could not even make it thru the whole trailer.  Cringeworthy.   Those wackey Nazi's but hey we can all learn a lesson that Jews and Nazi's are all people?!  What's with the modern soundtrack?  More ""Aren't we wackey-ness!""?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I heard ""your a f*ckman"
tL4McUzXfFI,"""STUPIDEST, MOVIE, EVER!"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Sono chi no sadame...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just wondering, what do you call it when a White actor puts on makeup to look Black and portray them as stupid?  BTW, when will the film be made about Israelis, played by non-Jews, portraying Jews as bad and stupid and for them to be really wise they need to give their land back to the Palestinians?"
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s like Moonrise Kingdom meets The Book Thief
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder how controversial this is going to be in Germany.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I absolutely am PSYCHED for this movie. As a jewish girl, i was super nervous fron the idea that theyre making nazis seem ""funny"" but the small love between jew and nazi? Im fucking excited"
tL4McUzXfFI,Kiwis for the win!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,And the triggering begins just watch the Left start freaking out 😗👌
tL4McUzXfFI,I see nothing wrong with this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"When he says “a jew” it comes out like “achoo” so the girls days “gesundheit”, which means “bless you”. Only thing I remembered from my German class lol"
tL4McUzXfFI,Thank you so much
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojoooooooooooo!!!!  But it isn't a JoJo's refference...
tL4McUzXfFI,You utter fool! German science is the greatest in the world!
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie better end with a special version of Hey Jude
tL4McUzXfFI,",,,,,,this isn’t part 2 is it"
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m confused
tL4McUzXfFI,Heroes by David Bowie in German
tL4McUzXfFI,Brilliant soundtrack
tL4McUzXfFI,This is propaganda. To ze chamber
tL4McUzXfFI,Scarlett Johansson turned the Nazis into Hotzis.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I cannot wait for the Nick Fury post credit scene, where he tells Jojo he's become part of something greater."
tL4McUzXfFI,i wonder if this has a happy ending
tL4McUzXfFI,"What is Hitler trying to conquer?
*ZA WARUDOOOO*"
tL4McUzXfFI,1:40 Sounds like the modern Leftist party.
tL4McUzXfFI,The best feel-good Hitler comedy you'' see all year!
tL4McUzXfFI,try to make a joke about nazi in UK... but because its main stream company please take your kids to cinema and learn more about nazi.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Тайка, что ты, бл_ть, придумал?! Ё-маё"
tL4McUzXfFI,Got choked up when they started playing Heroes.  RIP Starman
tL4McUzXfFI,What?
tL4McUzXfFI,r/unexpectedJoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,Cant stand this muppet he not a real kiwi
tL4McUzXfFI,Huffington Post is gonna be too shocked to give this a bad review
tL4McUzXfFI,"Important message about the fragility of our minds and how easy we are influenced...

A lesson on the lines we cross (that we entirely overlook) and why we cross them...

A boy is literally willing to become a Nazi (a member of a murderous, hateful group) because he wants to be accepted, wants to be respected, and wants the positive reinforcement of his peers...even if his peers are Nazis

Just think about what societal standards and values that you adopt because it makes you look better in the eyes of others...

For example: Men want to be tough and cool and smart and want to be recognized as such so we adapt ourself to the image of what society tells us this kind of person is and how they would act

(I.e eat meat, belittle others, abuse women, support gun violence)

Most (if not all) ideas and beliefs we hold on to...are actually not our own....they are just our fathers or our coach’s....societies beliefs that we adapted because it made us look better to our peers, but all I see is a sheep conforming to fit in with the other sheep who can’t think for themselves and make their own decisions, who are cowards who decide who they are based on the criteria of others. You are the Nazi who didn’t have the balls to stand up to the Nazis so you became one (it’s worse actually because you so quickly adopted the beliefs of others that you don’t even get a chance to be anyone before you became a Nazi)

Think long and hard about who you really are and who you want to be and why, not just based on what society has told you is cool that you blindly gobbled up like a serving of shit"
tL4McUzXfFI,Honestly wanna see this movie now.
tL4McUzXfFI,jews will potentially kill someone if they expose their lies about history.
tL4McUzXfFI,No
tL4McUzXfFI,My Dads old boss was not able to ever move his right arm. He was 10 years old in Germany when he actually met Hitler. It was at the end of the war.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Black Widow And Korg huh?
Mmmmmm........"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is outright disgusting, millions of innocent people died and you're making a joke out of it"
tL4McUzXfFI,When Jews watch this......
tL4McUzXfFI,IM THROWING AWAY MY HUMANITY
tL4McUzXfFI,So is this a comedy? WTF?!
tL4McUzXfFI,I MUST SEE THIS!
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I want to watch this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,"ゴ ゴ ゴ

tL4McUzXfFI,Hugo Boss!
tL4McUzXfFI,I AM HERE FOR SCAR JO
tL4McUzXfFI,This ain't Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,"What, just what did I watch!!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is his imaginary freind hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,What the hell did I just watch?
tL4McUzXfFI,"1:41 Damn, they made part 9 Dio a female. Cant wait for the big fight at the end"
tL4McUzXfFI,*Braka monoga! Doitsu no kagaku wa sekai ichi!*
tL4McUzXfFI,Fox Searchlight ... this is technically a Disney movie now
tL4McUzXfFI,"What type of *SOCIOPATH* writes, produces, directs and stars in a KIDS film about HITLER?
The most embarrassing self obsessed dogshit since 'The day the clown cried'"
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m going to ask what the actual fuck maybe something more war following not like... this is to much for me to handle ITS A KID AS A NAZI
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm attracted to this marvelously quirky movie.  In an odd, far-reaching way (and from a deep, psychological perspective), it harkens Dr Jordan Peterson's warnings/admonitions about man's capacity for malevolence (and from that, how to fortify yourself to possibly resist it).  Specifically, Peterson talks about how any one of us - including himself - would have most likely ""fallen-in with the crowd"" of being a Nazi or BrownShirt in Germany circa 1930s.  It's easy to try and see ourselves as a social and spiritual hero of the day - say, an Anne Frank, or Dietrich Bonhoeffer, or Oskar Schindler - but only the rarest of us would have such stout, brave constitution.  Most of us would have succumbed to the omnipotent psychological phenomenon and brainwashing.  Taika Waititi tackles this deep, personal struggle in his own quirky, humorous style through the eyes of the young protagonist, Jojo.  It's fascinating, really.  (And just for the record, I, too, fear that I would have fallen in with the crowd back then.  Groupthink can be a very powerful setting; it's a mental state that can only be truly and honestly assessed after-the-fact.)"
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm so confused right now... Could be good or completely trash. We will see
tL4McUzXfFI,"wow...wtf is this? Making Nazis cute, what a  great idea. gtfo with this."
tL4McUzXfFI,Too bad it’s a Disney film :/
tL4McUzXfFI,thank you hollywood i love jewish people
tL4McUzXfFI,German David Bowie in the background ? Heh
tL4McUzXfFI,Too soon.

tL4McUzXfFI,david bowie in gErman i’m sold
tL4McUzXfFI,wow I did nazi this move coming but now I can't wait to see it
tL4McUzXfFI,"When I saw ""Jojo"" in the title, I,  sincerely, didn't expect the Third Reich to show up"
tL4McUzXfFI,What is this garbage??
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy shit this looks hilarious
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks highly controversial. will i see it? yes. :D
tL4McUzXfFI,How can anyone dislike this i fucking loved every second of this trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,I have Jewish heritage and I think this is funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,"okay, this is epic"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nobody: 

Me: The perfect opportunity to call it “Boys in the Brown Pajamas” was wasted."
tL4McUzXfFI,The girl ruined it I just wanted too see some kick ass Nazi movie
tL4McUzXfFI,What’s with the dislikes?
tL4McUzXfFI,WHAT DA FAWK 😂💀
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hope this movie also includes an Italian man with bubbles, 3 muscular Aztac men, and a handsome man with a cool hat 🎩"
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok so if I add 2 and 2 this is basically just Battle Tendency
tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m not sure how to feel, but I did laugh...."

tL4McUzXfFI,"Russian government will not show this movie in our cinema





*BUT WILL MAKE ANOTHER LUSTFUL FILM ABOUT FARTING NAZI*"
tL4McUzXfFI,German music was a great addition to the trailer.

tL4McUzXfFI,The sequel I want Hitler with an imaginary friend telling him what to do
tL4McUzXfFI,calvin and heil hobbes!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks weirdly interesting. Also that fat kid reminds me a lot of David Mitchell... I can already picture him saying ""are we the baddies?"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Too soon
tL4McUzXfFI,They so cute😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just wanted to watch il vento d'oro golden wind, but i got part 2"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks a hilarious movie. One that actually piqued my interests in the longest while.
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like new summer Hit!(ler)
tL4McUzXfFI,"The thing I hate about this movies is that it’s not directed, written, created by Wes Anderson"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jojo Rabbit's Bizarre adventure looks fun.


Obligatory Jojokes aside, this really does look like a good movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,How ironic that Warner(AT&T) distributes JoJo to the west.
tL4McUzXfFI,What the fuck did I just watch.. ?
tL4McUzXfFI,Anybody catch that twilight reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,"My brain goes ""jesus christ watch this movie"" but my heart goes ""what in the actual fuck"" well played taika.. well played"
tL4McUzXfFI,Id love to watch this

tL4McUzXfFI,Looks great!
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok I laughed real hard
tL4McUzXfFI,That Shrek song in the background. Nostalgia
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m gonna like seeing Scarlett Johansson as a nazi
tL4McUzXfFI,Do people really think this is fucking funny? Why would i want to watch a movie about the people who killed my grandparents. You think people wanna laugh about this?? Its not funny its a terrible thing that happend. I do not wanna see a funny joking hitler. Not at all.
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm curious to see how this movie will be censored in Germany
tL4McUzXfFI,"Sheeeeit.....
Can you fucking imagine how much ""reeeee!!!"" this will generate? I can hear it now. SJWs will probably firebomb the theaters. Finally, someone has the balls to make a daring movie in this crumbling society of hyper-sensitive, lispy half-fags, offended by the wind itself."
tL4McUzXfFI,Recommend movie for antifa
tL4McUzXfFI,The new JOJO is weird but hey it's JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE
tL4McUzXfFI,Sabaton eagerly awaits for this time come out so they can make a song about it
tL4McUzXfFI,As someone who not only volunteers at the local holocaust museum but is of Germanic descent I'm not sure how to feel about this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm actually like... absurdly happy to see this movie, and I don't know why. Definitely gonna watch it when it comes out."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie might actually be good I’m not completely sure but I’ll give it a shot
tL4McUzXfFI,Germany release date?
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow an original looking movie that I actually feel like I want to watch
tL4McUzXfFI,You had me at Sam Rockwell
tL4McUzXfFI,Odd to see a movie about humanizing Jewish people while Hollywood elites are dehumanizing them.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Scarlet Johansson is Jewish in real life, this is going to be interesting."
tL4McUzXfFI,Someone owes Count Dankula an apology.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks like one of those movies that are funny at first, but then it gets depressingly dark & it leaves the audience saying ""Wow! I did Nazi that coming."""
tL4McUzXfFI,"2:09 When is it ever, really?  Also: this looks amazing!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh sweet, just like my armband."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference

tL4McUzXfFI,When will it come in germany?
tL4McUzXfFI,A Nazi movie without Von Strohime? 0/10
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like like a Disney movie lol

tL4McUzXfFI,Darn no jojo movie. This still looks good though.
tL4McUzXfFI,cant wait
tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m excited for this movie for 2 reasons:
1. Comedy hitler movie, that’s just a great topic with a lot to work with and I hope it’s good
2. The director because they directed Thor ragnarok and a really good movie that wasn’t easy to see outside AUS and NZ called hun for the wilderpeople. The 2nd movie is great because of its believable characters, great humour, simply amazing editing and a highlight is the music. This trailer alone makes me excited as the music and characters seem really good as well as the story. This seems a bit more directed towards being grounded in reality rather than comedy for some bits, which is respectable yet I would enjoy it as well as a comedy centred movie. Although hunt for the wilder people had a nice mix of comedy, action and story so I think the same will apply here"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this the next protagonist for part 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,Basically Anne Frank
tL4McUzXfFI,"Not only is he called JoJo, it's also part 2 era and they used a King Crimson song in the trailer. Coincidence? No."
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is offensive on so many levels.

tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo part 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Obviously, Hitler was evil. But why doesn’t Hollywood make a film about Stalin? He was even more evil. Slaughtering even more people than Hitler. Maybe cause Hollywood’s beliefs are more in line with Stalin? 🤷🏾‍♂️"
tL4McUzXfFI,We asked for a black widow movie...this is okay to i guess

tL4McUzXfFI,i cannot wait to watch this
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAN ENGINEERING IS ZE GREATEST IN ZE WORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s a shame they’ll all probably die from the countless allied terror strikes from American and British bombers that were intended to level entire cities while the civilian population was still present.
tL4McUzXfFI,Kiwi accent from the little kid at the end 👍🏻
tL4McUzXfFI,They should make one just like this but instead of hitler . Its mr trump!!!! That would be epic.
tL4McUzXfFI,Its amazing that there is a movie in 2019 where the cast is all white lol Just that alone makes this movie racist without any context.  The left will be foaming at the mouth
tL4McUzXfFI,Hahahahaha 😂👍🏻
tL4McUzXfFI,You know what this actually looks interesting.
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Moonrise Kingdom"" 
         + 
""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" 
         =
""Jojo Rabbit""



The cinematography of this trailer is just so beautiful to look at. Love to see what colors should really look like in a movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,Yes please
tL4McUzXfFI,I knew taika waititi was crazy but it takes a special type of crazy to play the role of an off brand imaginary friend version of Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks unrealistic, ridiculous, and pretty terrible."
tL4McUzXfFI,Yep this place is overrun with JoJo memes.
tL4McUzXfFI,"HOLY SHEEEEEEIIIITTT, this actually looks good."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm from Germany, this looks...interesting."
tL4McUzXfFI,Based
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this guy gonna win an Oscar for playing Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do these two little guys look like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost
tL4McUzXfFI,I hate how they don’t say that Waititi didn’t direct what we do in the shadows which is easily one of the best comedies of the past 20 years
tL4McUzXfFI,"Anyone: *says the word ""jojo"" or ""stand"" in literally any context*
Jojo fans: _Allow us to introduce ourselves_"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh mein gott it's me when I was in kamp




Just not _that_ kind of kamp"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I can imagine the adult versions of JoJo and the  big kid with glasses
Simon Pegg and .......( Forgot his name...)
His best friend in Shaun of the dead"
tL4McUzXfFI,"So Disney's fine with this film, but they cut ties with Pewdiepie for making the same point?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Aww, David Bowie's ""Heroes"" in German"
tL4McUzXfFI,You thought it was jojo but it was me DIO
tL4McUzXfFI,"Considering the fourth Reich is the novus ordo seclorum, yeah, I wanna see this + my name is the Spanish derivative of the middle German radulf, the root of Adolf.  It means Noble Wolf 🤫"
tL4McUzXfFI,When you're cast as imaginary Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,BLACK WIDOW LIVES!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,What the fuck is this....I'm intrigued but wtf
tL4McUzXfFI,"I cannot begin to tell you how deeply disturbed and disgusted I am to see this movie ad playing before other videos I watch on YouTube. I grew up in a Jewish household and the idea of making the Nazi Party into some kind of comedy is the most abhorrent thing I have seen in decades. This is only going to embolden White Nationalists in America and give tribute to Donald Trump and his racist remarks. I am going to strongly protest against this movie and anyone who thinks they are covering their sins by adding a little bit of drama to it has no clue to the greater harm they are creating. Shame on the creators, the actors involved and anyone else who wants to make light of the most recent gruesome and tremendously evil force that this world has experienced. It's sick."
tL4McUzXfFI,Does it say the rating anywhere in the trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,Yikes.
tL4McUzXfFI,Im so confused yet excited. I wonder they will show this movie at my cinema.
tL4McUzXfFI,You utter foooooools!!!!!! German technology is the best in the world!!!!!!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"JoJo, getting you into great music and the variations. Except for Siwa. 

Seriously, I looked up the German version of Heroes for this"
tL4McUzXfFI,Mit all deiner Liebe by Jack White german version of im a believer
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to be a brilliant film.
tL4McUzXfFI,When the movie is one big nazi joke #gen z 👌👌👌
tL4McUzXfFI,"I think the character Scarlett Johansson will die in this movie, just a theory."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a von stroheim origin story?
tL4McUzXfFI,When I first saw this I throught I was having a stroke
tL4McUzXfFI,0:46 can save life.
tL4McUzXfFI,*I don't know whats going on but i like it*
tL4McUzXfFI,You I am going to cry if Hitler dies
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie actually looks pretty funny like “good boys” 1944 edition
tL4McUzXfFI,Everybody in the comment section talking about a Jojo anime thing but I'm here still waiting to see when Jojo Siwa is gonna make an appearance
tL4McUzXfFI,Absolutely in love with thomasin McKenzie she is the epitome of gorgeous!!!!! I can't wait to see this movie...
tL4McUzXfFI,iS  ThaT A joJO ReFErenCE
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't know if I should be scared for this film as Hitler is a sore subject to many or embrace the weird film from the weirdo that is TaIka Waititi.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the wrong JoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,1:23 The new Rammstein Deutschland music video
tL4McUzXfFI,this is definitely gonna be a sad movie
tL4McUzXfFI,1:55 I love this shot
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I feel bad for the guy playing hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,Hmmm I wonder y I haven't seen a single black person in this trailer yet
tL4McUzXfFI,"The whole book burning thing is very misunderstood, the Nazis never hated books, quite the opposite they loved books, espically if it was books they thought supported their cause, the book burning thing was a fan wet dream supported by the Nazi party: it was basically a censor move by the party members, no different than Christians burning LGBT books or the Qur'an."
tL4McUzXfFI,I doubt this film will get many complaints..most new age liberals knowledge of history is extremely limited..because anyone who disagrees is a Nazi..well continue to take your hormone therapy and let's watch some Nazi fun.
tL4McUzXfFI,Someone please tell me who does the German Monkees cover
tL4McUzXfFI,I already know the fat glasses kid is going to be my favorite character from that Panzershrek scene.
tL4McUzXfFI,This kinda seems like it will be dumb
tL4McUzXfFI,How many nazi movies are they gonna make 🙄
tL4McUzXfFI,"Name’s a reference to something really obscure, no one really knows what"
tL4McUzXfFI,He should turn her in to the Gestapo. He'd get promoted
tL4McUzXfFI,"I was a little scared that people would be upset about this movie,, but I'm really glad I'm not really seeing any hate on it mostly :)"
tL4McUzXfFI,Fuhrer Crimson no nouriyoku
tL4McUzXfFI,"When I heard the German version of Bowie's '""Heroes""' ('""Helden""') I fangirled so harrrrrrd xD"
tL4McUzXfFI,ANOTHER STUPID BRIT FLIX.  We won the war for you-------now let it go!
tL4McUzXfFI,I will Nazi this
tL4McUzXfFI,Well let's see what the true hate is while I read the comments
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really good
tL4McUzXfFI,To think this movie was about the book my brother secret
tL4McUzXfFI,SUTANDO TSUKAI!
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,The Judel are at it again 🙄🙄
tL4McUzXfFI,I will see this
tL4McUzXfFI,So we have a guy playing as Hitler....I knew this was going to happen someday.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Another piece of filth from jewish Hollywood, should do a film pertaining to the manifest pedophiles that exist in Hollywood. By any means I would assume to bring shame to the German people."
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy hell this movie looks good
tL4McUzXfFI,What a bunch of brain washing shit. Every liberal in the country will think their is a nazi bebind every bush and young white boys are being trained to kill F this movie bunch of cattle n ship being herded around by Hollywood 😁
tL4McUzXfFI,"I absolutely love the trailer, this movie looks amazing."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,Racist
tL4McUzXfFI,"To all the 'Hitler is vewy bad man people.' We know he is bad you can shut the fuck up now. Hitler would have no influence today except for in history lessons if you lummox didn't wine every time he appeared. He is very bad man, he killed people, I can get that. But every God damn time something looks remotely enjoyable you have to try and ruin it. 'We must remove his influence by opening are buttholes to him and getting butthurt leaving voyeurs to watch us and get ideas to put more Hitler cock up there.' Best thing you can do is just not watch it and go on with your life!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's Bizarre Adventure part 9 is looking promising
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh hayl yah!
tL4McUzXfFI,is this springtime for hitler but for realsies.
tL4McUzXfFI,Von Strohiem better make a cameo
tL4McUzXfFI,COME ALLREADY I WANT THIS TO COME OUT
tL4McUzXfFI,0:19
tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t believe this exists and I’m glad it does.
tL4McUzXfFI,Reading the comments and seeing all the jojo references makes me so happy to be alive. Faith in humanity is restored.
tL4McUzXfFI,"JoJo and his stand ""I'm a believer""
Comment the stand stats and powers and go to town."
tL4McUzXfFI,This type of camera work reminds me of Edgar Wright
tL4McUzXfFI,this is secretly a disney movie
tL4McUzXfFI,German David Bowie is funny
tL4McUzXfFI,How did tv from wolfenstien universe get through to ours?
tL4McUzXfFI,Russell from Up
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid at the end is mini Nick Frost
tL4McUzXfFI,"I, Jojo Rabbit, have a dream."
tL4McUzXfFI,Such fabrications de
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait till the liberals get word of this lol
tL4McUzXfFI,Thought this was anime ngl
tL4McUzXfFI,jojo!!
tL4McUzXfFI,dont know if this movie is gonna be for me....
tL4McUzXfFI,"The title has the word ""Jojo"", you should know what to expect from these comments."
tL4McUzXfFI,If Wes Anderson was Jesus Christ this would be the equivalent of a terrible Christian movie.  This is a Moonrise Kingdom wanna be.
tL4McUzXfFI,Should've known there'd be more heart in this movie. Taika always delivers.
tL4McUzXfFI,*Giorno's piano starts playing*
tL4McUzXfFI,Any Jews planning on watching this?
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo reference? Stroheim easter egg?
tL4McUzXfFI,They need to release the background song on a separate trailer.
tL4McUzXfFI,Haha the panzershrek
tL4McUzXfFI,"Idk wtf I just watched, but it looks amazing"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Goes to comment section expecting to see a bunch of political bullshit.

Instead finds nothing but anime memes cause of the word jojo"
tL4McUzXfFI,Boy in the striped pajamas but a comedy
tL4McUzXfFI,i loved hunt for the wilder people im sure im going to love this
tL4McUzXfFI,jojo? Jojo Joestar?
tL4McUzXfFI,Reminds me of Wes Anderson in a strange way
tL4McUzXfFI,I was expecting a different kind of JOJO.
tL4McUzXfFI,🤣🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,"Taika Waititi: This is what you get when you mess with spiderman Disney!
Disney: NO PLEASE, IM SORRY
Taika Waititi: THIS IS WHAT YOU GET!!!
*Disney begins screaming as the sound of SJW Screeching was heard in the distance*"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is pretty cool.
tL4McUzXfFI,"That one kid looks EXACTLY like a young Nick Frost from Shaun of the Dead, wtf??"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Don’t listen little jojo....
She’s trying to get in those little boy panties, have your kid... then make you pay child support.
Jews will do anything to get some coin."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Never have i been so confused in 2:18

Edit: this is going to be absolutely crucified by sjws"
tL4McUzXfFI,Best movie of 2019 already 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Third time watching it it’s still good
tL4McUzXfFI,Wheres his Stand?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This can't be real, right?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Only in taika’s mind is something like this created
God bless this man"
tL4McUzXfFI,Don’t let pc culture ruin this.
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler is his stand instead of ora ora ora nie nie nie
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare yare daze
tL4McUzXfFI,"So it's the story of how a boy raised to be a Nazi, ends up liking a Jew, and then defends her from death? I suppose it says humans should live by the no harm principle unless defending themselves.... Not sure if it's the right context in which to present that message tho. It's lying about historical context."
tL4McUzXfFI,So Black Widow the wife of Stroheim ?
tL4McUzXfFI,why did they name this JoJo lo
tL4McUzXfFI,They should sell merch
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks fucking amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,"Movie name: JoJo Rabbit

Anime fans: is this a JoJo Reference?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"So it's about Hitler's youth.
Cool.




Oh wait they're hiding a jew from the natzis. Interesting."
tL4McUzXfFI,Helden is a great song
tL4McUzXfFI,*Stroheim’s Bizarre Adventure*
tL4McUzXfFI,If dio doesn’t show up in this I’m gonna be pissed
tL4McUzXfFI,oy vey i wonder who made this
tL4McUzXfFI,Weird
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF IS THIS! Making light of the atrocities of world war 2 and the nazi regime! The bodies of 11 million peoples have  just literally just gone cold and this is how we respond...
tL4McUzXfFI,*This actually looks like a really good film!*
tL4McUzXfFI,The first half reminds me of Marxist professors and Antifi these days. Looks like a funny\dramatic movie. You've got my curiosity.
tL4McUzXfFI,Okay this looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,*Hitler can never be so cute and deadly at the same time.*
tL4McUzXfFI,Cant wait for this to come out
tL4McUzXfFI,"lmaoo, this is interesting"
tL4McUzXfFI,I like hitler I'm so watching this
tL4McUzXfFI,What the hell is this?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie: exists
JoJo fans: nice place narren"
tL4McUzXfFI,hopefully this doesnt turn into the pajama situation i cant handle it
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a Jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Well at least we know what Scarlett was doing after she was done filming for Endgame
tL4McUzXfFI,I audition for that movie like a year ago no joke
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy shit is this a Jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Something with the word *Jojo*

JoJo fans: *AYAYAY*"
tL4McUzXfFI,My jaw just hit the floor
tL4McUzXfFI,"That Panther tank has american paintings and signs. 
Ardennes offensive?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Calvin and Hobbes: hi.
Fox: grab the best director ever, make Hobbes Hitler, and make it near the end of world war 2."
tL4McUzXfFI,Woah this is pretty edgy
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope that chubby kid is in most of the movie! he seems to be the best part of the comedy..Lol
tL4McUzXfFI,"Antifa will you go? Come on , unmask , grab some popcorn ! It’ll be a gas!"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks freaking crazy!
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't know why this movie is called Jojo rabbit.. its a little boy named Jojo.. but where does the rabbit come in? I don't see any rabbits in the movie. 

Also the more I see trailers of this movie I kind of want to see it.."
tL4McUzXfFI,BBBRRRRRRRRAAAAKAAA MONOGAAAAA
tL4McUzXfFI,"It’s 2019 
Everyone is getting offended by everything
Release a family friendly movie with Hitler in it....
I did Nazi that coming."
tL4McUzXfFI,Adolf hitler! ZA WARUDO! ORAORAORAORA
tL4McUzXfFI,What song is that
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAN SCIENCE IS ZE BEST
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks to be the best nazi film ever
tL4McUzXfFI,This seems like something taika watiti would make
tL4McUzXfFI,"“Got it! We’ll burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill!”
“Got it! I’ll negotiate!”
“...”
“...”
“I mean negotiate-“"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I want to watch this
tL4McUzXfFI,Those damn nazis burning invaluable books of science!
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone know the music in the second half of this?
tL4McUzXfFI,I did Nazi that coming. Frankly Anne did Nazi that coming either. This seems wrong on so many levels.
tL4McUzXfFI,"""This film is funded by Fegelein! Fegelein!! Fegelein!!!! Neinnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!"" -- Poor old man in bunker"
tL4McUzXfFI,You know I know this is going to turn maybe pretty sjw but I actually kind of want to watch this
tL4McUzXfFI,It has Nazi imagery in it so it must be praising the Nazis someone call the FBI pls
tL4McUzXfFI,People need to chill out this movie looks funny as hell since when is it a bad thing to make fun of the Nazis God damn it we beat them on for this what you do
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't expect to like this so much.
tL4McUzXfFI,is i just me or Hitler is just his imaginary friend because. in 0:22 - 0:27 it says “when i was a kid i had a imaginary friend that got me in trouble”. That’s why hitler doesn’t talk to no one
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought this was directed by Wes Anderson.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Leave it to the left and Hollywood to create a sympathetic and feel good movie surrounding Nazis, then turn around and lie about Trump supporting Nazis, when in reality he condemned them and white supremacists in the same breath. It's funny how the only people really bringing up the word ""Nazi"", or waiving or drawing the swastika as graffiti, are AntiFa and other idiots on the left. The left is anti-Israel and pro-Hamas/Palestine. The left supports ""ex"" KKK members like Robert Byrd. The left supports the Negro Project (Google it) a.k.a. Planned Parenthood to continue their racist genocide on the black community. The left supports the mass incarceration of black men in this country. The left opposed abolishing slavery, were for Jim Crow laws, and were against the Civil Rights Act. AntiFa are our modern day Brown Shirts, but much more sloppy, fat, and smelly. What's the next racist thing the left and Hollywood will be for or support?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"We can be heros david bowie but its in german, awsome"
tL4McUzXfFI,So this was before Jojolion but after Steel ball run?
tL4McUzXfFI,Up until about 0:50 this looked really good than it just looked ok
tL4McUzXfFI,The Monkee’s I’m a Believer (German Version) and David Bowie Heroes
tL4McUzXfFI,"What would Captain America think after seeing Black Widow raise a nazi family.

*hail hydra*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I swear, the first time I watched this, I was like, “WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THISSS!!!???? IT’S A HITLER COMEDYYYY!!!! WTF?!” But then as I was doing more research on it, I was like “oops... my bad”"
tL4McUzXfFI,What is that second songs name?
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing! I dont like watching a lot of movies but this one is a yes.
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally another comedic nazi movie😂
tL4McUzXfFI,I HAVE to see this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,My mom and her whole family are Jewish and me and my mom found this hilarious. I can hear the snowflakes screeching about this film already.
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is where the soul stone took black widow to💀💀
tL4McUzXfFI,"USA : Lol a funny nazi comedy. Who’s gonna get angry about this?
Germany : Ahh Shit, Here we go again"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wtf is everyone talking about 'part 5, 6, 7, ect' and people saying references? Wtf???"
tL4McUzXfFI,German technology IS SEKAI ICHHIIIIIIIIII
tL4McUzXfFI,God I love the nazi's. Such an awesome sense of humor.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this film supposed to be a story about Stroheim childhood or what?
tL4McUzXfFI,Stop using runes to represent hatred. Sowilo (the runs commonly associated with the SS that we see most commonly in this trailer) represents the sun and the power of the sun. It is not a hate symbol I know it was used as one but I think it’s important people recognize that it was turned into a hate symbol just like the swastika.
tL4McUzXfFI,Burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill 😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"Lol this is to stir racial tensions, same with slavery movies... What’s the other reason?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"i showed my jewish mother this she said


ew thats disgusting"
tL4McUzXfFI,I love this already.
tL4McUzXfFI,I really like how Disney is showing us the funnier and cuddlier side of Hitler. So many people never really get to see that these days.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Cant believe Stroheim is getting his OWN MOVIE!
tL4McUzXfFI,You fools you thought this was a JOJO movie this ha this is a me Dio movie
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks much better than that bad boys trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,wow i can't believe were getting a theatrical release of a Jojo spinoff of Stroheim the most beloved anime nazi ever. though i was not expecting it to be live action take it or leave it. also i had no idea Stroheim was the great great great grand father of jimmy b rabbit
tL4McUzXfFI,I think the twist is that Hitler is actually Jo Jo’s figment of his imagination
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf is this
tL4McUzXfFI,I could tell that everyone is gonna get triggered by this I say wait to watch it then you all could get but hurt
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie makes me feel so confusion
tL4McUzXfFI,0:18 That guy looks very handsome
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo!!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,0:30 Tom Holland really let himself go
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks funny as hell
tL4McUzXfFI,LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!   u got me at LMAO........ i'm in : )
tL4McUzXfFI,"If I believe I'm correct, the song in the background is ""I'm an Believer"" but it's in German instead. Also, it's the first song when the video first starts."
tL4McUzXfFI,Yes
tL4McUzXfFI,LET THE LEFTIST OUTRAGE COMMENCE!
tL4McUzXfFI,"If this movie had mostly British actors, no one would have even tried to use a German accent."
tL4McUzXfFI,What
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh boy the critics and media are about to have the field day of field days when this comes out
tL4McUzXfFI,the sudden contrast + the music made me cry lmfao
tL4McUzXfFI,There should be more movies like these to deter mad dogs from taking over.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,2:10 this is so true at this moment in society
tL4McUzXfFI,I love how they made famous English songs in German for this series.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks good I might see 

Triggered libtard:😡"
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't know stroheim had a kid. His stand hitler might be the first one to have manifested which will make part 9 dope af

tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a JoJo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi sympathy? Am I the only one made generally uncomfortable by this film in our current political climate or...

tL4McUzXfFI,whats the song at the end?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler, everybody's favorite wing-man!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi only makes cult movies. One of best directors we have. Reminds of Wes Anderson in a way
tL4McUzXfFI,This Jojo stand is Hitler xd
tL4McUzXfFI,lmao wacky funny Hitler Guy
tL4McUzXfFI,I've never been this excited about something so Caucasian 🤦🏿‍♂️
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this fucked up?

tL4McUzXfFI,"I have daydreams, where in Taika Waititi has an alter ego who is a real tough nut ruffian pleb who hails from Luton and his name is Taiko White Titties.... he's a mega football hooligan who hides a dark secret.... at night, when no one is watching or around, he performs BALLET!!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh great her comes the shitty JoJo memes..😒

tL4McUzXfFI,I can't wait for the people who think this movie is bad to called rascist..

tL4McUzXfFI,"Hollywood definitely has a nazi fetish, which doesn't make any sense but whatever"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hmmm i am german shuld i watch thr german dub or thr English version🤔

tL4McUzXfFI,"Yeah, this is the only thing I’m looking forward to."
tL4McUzXfFI,Spoiler: hitler dies
tL4McUzXfFI,I wasn’t sure at first but I really want to see it now hahaa
tL4McUzXfFI,Future Cult classic
tL4McUzXfFI,I am equally excited for the soundtrack as I am for the film itself
tL4McUzXfFI,This shit looks good
tL4McUzXfFI,"Salut to my jobros in the comments,keep up the good work but these German song covers are so godamn good"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Season 9 is looking wierd, where is Stroheim ?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looked like all of Wes Anderson's films except it doesn't have Bill Murray.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah yes, a movie to enjoy with Hans and flamethrower."
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh...

tL4McUzXfFI,Wait this isn’t a jojo bizarre adventure related movie? Shame
tL4McUzXfFI,"PART 9 JOJO CONFIRMED 

""WITNESS MY STAND, _MEIN KAMPF_ """
tL4McUzXfFI,W-w-w-wait did Strohiem get his own movie
tL4McUzXfFI,a jewish man playing hitler in a movie making fun of him? is such a power move
tL4McUzXfFI,I think the film is based on the perspective of the kid(s) in the film... How they were brainwashed into believe that what they were doing was the right thing and that Jews were evil...
tL4McUzXfFI,IS NO ONE GONNA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE GESUNDHEIT THING
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hear the words ""Speed Wagon"" durring this movie and I'm gunna plotz! :P"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This look Cringe...
But I look forward to Jo Jokes!"
tL4McUzXfFI,I love  how this is about  the  holocaust  but it's  funny
tL4McUzXfFI,"So, Part 9's Jojo is an alternate timeline son of Stroheim with a Stand called 「Mein Fuhrer」  Nice."
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm not sure whether the young boy and his chubby friend are real child actors or Simon Pegg and Nick Frost with some top quality facial prostetics and CGI.
tL4McUzXfFI,"If you make jokes about Nazis as a Hollywood elite they’ll give you applause and status

If you’re a Scottish youtuber they’ll try and throw you in a cell"
tL4McUzXfFI,The perfect crossover right here
tL4McUzXfFI,Where is Dio?
tL4McUzXfFI,Ayy scarlet Johansson said she wanted a solo movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Go to wacth
tL4McUzXfFI,Rofl what the hell is this ... looked like a fun nazi comedy then they introduced the Juden...
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this disney nazi stuff again
tL4McUzXfFI,Merchant really living up to his name of Das Freaken Goggle-eye and Das lanken pissenstreak.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Are we going to get a funny ww2 comedy about the soviet rape of eastern europe next? Or maybe a funny comedy about a japanese person in  hiroshima whos flash fried and suffering, man isnt hollywood so in touch with modern culture"
tL4McUzXfFI,Who else have no idea what the comment people are talking about?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait, so count dankula is raked over the coals, goes to trial for 2 years and gets fined for a Nazi pug video but this shit is being shown around the world? What the fuck is wrong with this planet"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I wouldn't have minded the satire comedy with an exaggerated interpretation of the Hitler youth/child soldiers, but then going the Anne frank route to make it an after school special to further make Nazi's seem like the worst humanity can produce is pretty unoriginal, not too mention is borderline sexualizing kids even if it's pitched as a romantic comedy, at that age what does anyone know about love?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh boy, the media's gonna hit this movie HARD. Hope it lives through it."
tL4McUzXfFI,*GOD BLESS THE JOJO COMMUNITY FOR ALL THESE JOKES*
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought it was a Wes Anderson film.
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really fucking good
tL4McUzXfFI,I am not defending German technical superiority I AM STATING THE OBVIOUS
tL4McUzXfFI,"""it's definitely not a good time to be a nazi"" jesus christ, the actors might as well be winking at the fucking camera. what a garbage script"
tL4McUzXfFI,Duuuumb
tL4McUzXfFI,"I think I get it. Jojo bizzare adventure is a manga that happens to have the same name of this movie, but they are not related at all. Uff that took me some time but I think I got it :) I'm happy"
tL4McUzXfFI,I can hear the feminist's screaming
tL4McUzXfFI,omg i KNEW jews were the real victims! i knew it! thank god for this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,So basically Scarlett is a traitor and should be shot.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Consistent wartime vilification propaganda for 75 years. We get it jews, the Nazis were everything from cartoonish evil imbeciles to just plan comicbook evil villains."
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to see Hitler dance in a forest
tL4McUzXfFI,Michel bay would approve 2:11
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh look, its Jesus"
tL4McUzXfFI,This gonna be controversial
tL4McUzXfFI,HIS NAME IS JOJO
tL4McUzXfFI,WHY CANT THIS COME OUT IN UK SAME AS AMERICA THEN I CAN WATCH IT ON MY BIRTHDAY
tL4McUzXfFI,Cant wait to see this at Disney world
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm glad Disney is allowing Fox Searchlight to keep making movies!
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks SO GOOD!
tL4McUzXfFI,"The scariest thing is how the kid doesn't have the face scar in some clips but does in others. Probably going to be played off as a comedic scene even though its horrific, like the premise of this movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,What a bunch of shit. I'm really starting to believe Hollywood is run by a bunch of P3D0's
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, who in the fuck thought this would be a good idea?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks hilarious! They should do a spin off movie about the soviet unions version of the Hitler youth.
tL4McUzXfFI,NSFW!
tL4McUzXfFI,That was amazing ?????
tL4McUzXfFI,"I WILL USE MY STAND  WHITE HITLAAAAAA 
JEWDAN JEWDAN JEWDAN  JEEEWDAAAAAAAN 
(stand ability gas and burn able to create noxious gases that come out of shower head shoulder pads)
defeated by America using its stand SILVER PATRIOT by using Nuke"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't like this at all. Comedy is a great thing don't get me wrong but know your boundaries. Making a comedy out of WW2 shouldn't be done. It was a brutal, devastating, awful war and should not be taken light-hearty."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks like a pretty Bizarre Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy shit is that a JOJO reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I am Jewish.
I find this hilarious."
tL4McUzXfFI,There is no better way of marketing your product than randomly throwing jojo in
tL4McUzXfFI,Civil war in South Africa and the jews did it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7lYFgPPmCE
tL4McUzXfFI,"And then the main character died in Berlin when Soviet came.
I am not kidding, many Hitler's Youth children were pressed into service during Battle of Berlin. Like the kids from Downfall movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,I REJECT MY IDEOLOGY JOJO
tL4McUzXfFI,Seeing Scarlett Johansson as a mom warms my heart!
tL4McUzXfFI,imagine the actor when he was asked to be hitlwr
tL4McUzXfFI,Somebody forgot history.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Why are Hitler's eyes so pretty?
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi owes the uk government £800 for this film.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is no one going to mention the Twilight reference???
tL4McUzXfFI,This is definitely inspired by Moonrise Kingdom.
tL4McUzXfFI,0:26 Hitler's face when a little kid puts 75 years of time travelers out of a job.
tL4McUzXfFI,"i see so when josuke and Stroheim ate the rokakaka fruit they became one , jojo rabbit"
tL4McUzXfFI,So basically Inglorious Basterds and Moonrise Kingdom had a baby.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a real movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok this makes a lot more sense to me now.
tL4McUzXfFI,*ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!!*
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim better show up
tL4McUzXfFI,Project 1065
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow....holy shit.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn’t care about anything in this trailer except I saw *_the mother flipping Americans._*
tL4McUzXfFI,i physically cannot wait to see this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait what
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler looks kinda different in the movie including his voice line as well.
tL4McUzXfFI,omg im so hyped
tL4McUzXfFI,"2 things: one can i get some of that shit you smoking? 2: so many JoJo fans making comments, ""turn back! its not what you think!"""
tL4McUzXfFI,I can't believe that Taika is Hitler!
tL4McUzXfFI,Trump supporters are confused at why it's a comedy
tL4McUzXfFI,I love to think that now a kid somewhere in the world can have “Child Nazi with Hitler as his imaginary friend” in a resume
tL4McUzXfFI,This seems like a rip off of a Wes Anderson movie
tL4McUzXfFI,S-o this is the new Disney movie nice
tL4McUzXfFI,How the left guy on 0:30 looks so much like Tom Holland yet looks nothing like him?!
tL4McUzXfFI,"The Art of Zhen Shan Ren ( Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance) International Exhibition was held in Toronto City Hall from August 26 to September 1, 2019.

The exhibition consisted of 22 works inspired from true events. The artworks display the beauty of Falun Dafa’s guiding principles, Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance and call attention to the persecution of practitioners in China. Many government officials came to speak during the opening ceremony or sent greeting letters."
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm getting some serious Mel Brooks vibes.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the second time I've encountered Jojo bazaar fans in a comment section first time was kc and Jojo music video.lulz
tL4McUzXfFI,This is gonna be one of the years best
tL4McUzXfFI,0:40 is that Jacob Rees-Mogg?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Feels like a Wes Anderson film.

Edit: The cinematography, not the Nazi characters"
tL4McUzXfFI,Can’t wait for this to come out
tL4McUzXfFI,Ending song?
tL4McUzXfFI,"""You're a 10 year old kid who likes dressing up in a uniform and wants to be part of a club.""

Honestly how I view nazis, tho."
tL4McUzXfFI,Best Picture Nominee???
tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t wait for this to come out!
tL4McUzXfFI,More jewish hollywood propaganda. Whites must never be proud of who they are and eternally atone for the horrible sin of being awesome.
tL4McUzXfFI,Alright... Nazis should not be this funny... god damn it 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo bizarre adventure part 9 weird war 2

tL4McUzXfFI,I love how the songs are all in German. Including David Bowie
tL4McUzXfFI,People are too sensitive.
tL4McUzXfFI,10 year olds shouldn't be involved with politics...but they should decide if they get life changing hormone therapy.
tL4McUzXfFI,and your next line is: Heiru Hitureruu
tL4McUzXfFI,Yoyoyoyoyoyyoyooyo whats the name of the song playing at the end
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought the movie title was about jojo so disappointed 😔
tL4McUzXfFI,"People say you can't made films like Blazing saddles again. This proves you can, just be sure to be smart and execute it properly."

tL4McUzXfFI,Finally another movie that has balls. This looks way better than bad boys
tL4McUzXfFI,Ah another one
tL4McUzXfFI,Why not an actual nice informative movie about the hitler youth with a decent plot
tL4McUzXfFI,I cannot wait for the sequel my neighbour Tojo
tL4McUzXfFI,Who thought this was a good idea again?
tL4McUzXfFI,So he has an imaginary hitler friend???
tL4McUzXfFI,i know waititi’s humor but let’s not humanize nazis even to prove a point... bad timing
tL4McUzXfFI,2:00 Who let those children carry a loaded bazooka? This is what happens when you let children carry a loaded bazooka.
tL4McUzXfFI,The cringe is real.
tL4McUzXfFI,THIS MOVIE SHOULD NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BE ALOUD TO EVEN SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT THE NAZIS  THEY ARE SCUM AND IT IS NEVER FUNNY WHEN MOVIES LIKE THIS GIVE THE THOUGHT THAT THIS  IS OK MY GRANDFATHER SERVED IN WORLD WAR 2 AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD BE ANGRY BY THIS THIS STUFF IS WHY THE WORLD IS SO MESSED UP LETTING THIS STUFF OUT LIKE IT's A JOKE BUT IT IS NOT I FOR 1 WILL NEVER WATCH THIS  AND TO ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS MOVIE YOU ARE NO FRIEND OR FAMILY OF MINE.
tL4McUzXfFI,but if Dankula makes a nazi jokes everyone shits themselves.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to be great
tL4McUzXfFI,I learned about this movie 3 minutes ago and I am so excited to see it that I'm not even sure how to end this comment.

tL4McUzXfFI,"""Definitely a bad time to be a nazi"" lmao this shizen is guten mien dude"
tL4McUzXfFI,song name?
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF are they trying to make a comedy about the worst group in history
tL4McUzXfFI,"Тайка Вайтити, ты ходишь по охеренно тонкому льду)))"
tL4McUzXfFI,I swear if they don't a scene with Hitler doing hardcore Meth I'll be very disappointed that they missed a perfect chance for a joke.
tL4McUzXfFI,Asa Butterfield 2?
tL4McUzXfFI,I love it
tL4McUzXfFI,THIS LOOKS LIKE ITS GONNA BE FUCKING HILARIOUS!
tL4McUzXfFI,Dont you just love how instead of remembering the atrocities the nazi's committed we make a comedy out of it? I'm sure all the holocaust survivors are lining up to see this film. How about instead of pulling some bullshit how about you make a movie showing how people were affected by the war or a movie from the German's side where they aren't eating a meat unicorns and Hitler wasn't used for comedic relief.
tL4McUzXfFI,Any reason a 19 year old Christian Kiwi is playing a Jewish love interest for a 10 year old boy?
tL4McUzXfFI,ya ya yeet
tL4McUzXfFI,"YEHSLAIQGWVEEYAYHAOAPEH

IT’S STEVE MERCHANT

IN A MOVIE ABOUT A KID GROWING UP IN NAZI GERMANY

DIRECTED BY TAIKA WAITITI

I. NEED. TO. SEE. THIS. MOVIE. RIGHT. NOW"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Burning books, dressing up in goofy outfits to be part of the club, is this the Antifa movie?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Just surprised that this movies has a Nazi main character and isn't being slammed  guess it is because he is a kid
tL4McUzXfFI,Yall really made a nazi comedy 🤣 fucking wow 🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,WHAT THE HELL???????????
tL4McUzXfFI,"Alternative title: ""The boy and his nazi 「STAND」"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Maybe Hitler had an imaginary friend: Micheal the rabid fanatical jew/slav hater/killer....
tL4McUzXfFI,2:01-nél a bal oldali gyerek úgy néz ki mint Dikk Eszmen
tL4McUzXfFI,This is cringe
tL4McUzXfFI,i wanna watch this
tL4McUzXfFI,"If Archie Yates doesn’t get at least an Oscar nod, there is no god."
tL4McUzXfFI,"When I was watching this trailer I kept thinking of, & quoting, Mel Brooks and his movies The Producers (the orginal) & To Be Or Not To Be."
tL4McUzXfFI,Sht i though it was Jotaro
tL4McUzXfFI,"Every seems to forget that many jews served in the nazi parties various armies. Including hitlers personal body guard.




Face it, the bad guys won ww2.
-me, a jew."
tL4McUzXfFI,I do not even know how to react to this . lol
tL4McUzXfFI,"Where's deacon, vlad and Peter?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is pog
tL4McUzXfFI,so... will Stroheim be in the film?
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm so glad they gave this film humor. If it was all serious I couldn't watch it. The imaginary Hitler is brilliant due to the kid having an overactive imagination. He doesn't fully understand how serious the world is. This looks like a brilliant unique film with a lot of charm.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hilarious choices/use of background music for this trailer. Monkeys' 'Believer' and Bowie's 'Heroes/Helfen' ..in German.
Movie itself looks very funny, ..with some edge. Mocking the truly mockable elements of groupthink/ideology and stateism/totalitarianism. ✌"
tL4McUzXfFI,I was about to get mad but then near the end I was pleasantly surprised. Hopefully it's an okay movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Brilliant.... brilliant.... f*cking brilliant. Jo Jo ist der MANNNNNNNNNN!
tL4McUzXfFI,Stephen Merchant always said he would make a great Nazi... he finally got his wish 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,IGN: Too Much Jojo and not enough Bizzare Adventures
tL4McUzXfFI,"Is this a prequel to the 1984 movie ""Cloak & Dagger"" starring Dabney Coleman?
I mean, first of all, that's a joke (I mean really, as if), but think about it: A young boy with an adult imaginary friend who nobody can see or interact with besides him who leads him on crazy adventures and gets him into trouble, but ultimately helps him to grow and mature as he realizes how much his belief in the guy is holding him back."
tL4McUzXfFI,@u
tL4McUzXfFI,No stands I am very disappointed
tL4McUzXfFI,"Um, hello, the first comedic movie about nazis was The Producers."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a motherfucking jojo reference??!
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo lol
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m watching this!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Dr. William Pierce had something to say about the moral of this story.
tL4McUzXfFI,I have no words
tL4McUzXfFI,Hey guys do you remember when Pewdiepie tried to make a nazi joke and his show got canceled? No problem though Disney is allowed to literally show hitler as a comedic harmless imaginary friend. Absolutely hypocritical and disgusting.
tL4McUzXfFI,heha this looks pretty funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, a movie I might actually see in theaters"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Omfg hahhahah 
This movie looks wild, wtf with David Bowie’s “Heroes”? Ahha"
tL4McUzXfFI,Stronheim better make an appearance in this
tL4McUzXfFI,Scarlet Johansson the Nazi's wet dream in more ways than one
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a movie with some ballsy directors
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie isn’t a good idea
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t even watch jojo but these comments got me loling
tL4McUzXfFI,10 years ago this movie would've had a huge backlash to the extent of being shut down. Luckily today we're living in times where nazis and racism is being normalized.
tL4McUzXfFI,So that’s how Natasha Romanov went after she died in Endgame
tL4McUzXfFI,"Me:”Hey this was a great trailer. Ima go to the comments and see what people think...”


Comments:KONO DIO DA!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Are we gonna see Deacon as a nazi vampire in this?
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if he'll teach JoJo Kung Fu.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I can’t wait for everyone to complain about this, they seriously can’t take a joke"
tL4McUzXfFI,"At first, I wanted to be outraged about a lighthearted movie about Nazis.....then I kept watching."
tL4McUzXfFI,This Movie is Genius! Can't wait to see it! #FUShitler
tL4McUzXfFI,"Taika just said ""Fuckit! This is gonna piss people off, and I don't care. It's funny!"""

tL4McUzXfFI,"Fox: We're making a comedy about Hitler and the director is the same as thor ragnarok

tL4McUzXfFI,Bro I so want to see this!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler was just a fun juvenile It's easy? What idiocy is this
tL4McUzXfFI,The only thing that would not make me want to see this movie is Rebel Wilson.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait So Hitlers Tyler Durden now?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nobody:
Stroheim: GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Waititi?, no thanks"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like a Wes Anderson movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Rebel Wilson!!!

tL4McUzXfFI,"I can already imagine how a real Nazi would react if they saw a Jew... and it's beautiful...

tL4McUzXfFI,I damn near cried when the script got serious
tL4McUzXfFI,"I just realised the anne frank reference, the jew in the attic XD"
tL4McUzXfFI,To be honest I really don't care looks like a funny movie tho. But I think it might offend German people of course anybody too but more German
tL4McUzXfFI,I just want to watch hittler
tL4McUzXfFI,I love the cover song selection! Black humour at its best!
tL4McUzXfFI,I feel like I am watching a young Nick Frost and Simon Pegg movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,First song is Mit all deiner liebe - Jack White
tL4McUzXfFI,"If any of the kid's loved ones die, I'm resurrecting Hitler."

tL4McUzXfFI,This........should be interesting
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow! what a bizarre adventure!
tL4McUzXfFI,Is no one going to talk about the fact that they made im a beliver and heros but in german for the trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,"Не понял, где русские комментарии? Или любые другие не на английском языке."
tL4McUzXfFI,Ready for your daily dose of jewish propaganda?
tL4McUzXfFI,"😈""Do you know what I am? Say it.""
🥺""A Jew.""
😇""Gesundheit.""

That exchange together with German ""Heroes"" was weirdly adorable! 😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,"*sigh*

Alright Alright

""German Technology is the finest in the world"""
tL4McUzXfFI,So that's what Black Widow used to do before thing the S.H.I.E.L.D!
tL4McUzXfFI,purple stroheim feedback? I'm down
tL4McUzXfFI,When a Jewish man directs a German movie uk it’s gonna be gd
tL4McUzXfFI,"And this, is how strohiem was born."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I really enjoyed German ""Heroes"" cover 😀"
tL4McUzXfFI,Cool story but I’m not seeing it 🤷🏾‍♂️
tL4McUzXfFI,That German version of “I’m a believer” is just the icing on the cake XD
tL4McUzXfFI,Lets hope for a tired anti-trump message....
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just wanted to watch il vento d'oro golden wind, but i got part 2"
tL4McUzXfFI,part 9 leak confirmed
tL4McUzXfFI,How did you make ww2 a comady
tL4McUzXfFI,You made a nazi movie a movie that would make SJWs scream but you did you made it...hiw else am I suppose to make them scream
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm surprised Fox greenlight this movie. Dont they know they're going to insult all their white Christians?
tL4McUzXfFI,"*YOU UTTER FOOL*
*GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE FINEST IN THE WORLD*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nazis are adorable! What sort of crap is this? Oh, and why are they all speaking Brit English? Because that is the default ""other"" voice for stupid American viewers who refuse to read subtitles."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand Name: Hail Erika
Ability: Able to spontaneously combust any enemy the user deems inferior to them"
tL4McUzXfFI,Esta de nazi xd
tL4McUzXfFI,"I want this movie removed or have Fox cut the deal with Disney, it's not funny and making a comdey out of a tragedy is unacceptable"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Okay its going to be funny but I dont know why makes jokes from the nazi Germany?!
Yeah, I am a “horrible” man who likes that era."
tL4McUzXfFI,I can smell the social engineering from here. No thanks.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m confused about the whole premise of the movie. Like someone full on pulled up and was like; “guys. You know what’s funny? Hitler. Now, why don’t we make Hitler into a Movie, and label it a comedy. Or better yet, why don’t we make it really awkward for the audience by making them feel apologetic to their Jewish friend who ‘insisted’ on going.”"
tL4McUzXfFI,I am confused...but in a good way...I think
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m guessing there is gonna be tons of controversy on this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,*IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE*
tL4McUzXfFI,So isn’t this gonna be banned in Germany???
tL4McUzXfFI,This isn't JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
tL4McUzXfFI,I legit wonder how Germany will React to this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This feels like X-mas story meets the loser club, meets Terry Gullim."
tL4McUzXfFI,Reported.  בס״ד
tL4McUzXfFI,Brace yourselves for the reviews my friends 😬
tL4McUzXfFI,I did Nazi this coming.....

tL4McUzXfFI,Check out the greatest story never told. It's way better than this garbage.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Alright, Jojo memes aside this movie actually looks touching in a weird, WWII  sense....I’m down to watch it"
tL4McUzXfFI,The dumbest shit I've ever seen. Also there were no fat kids in Germany in this time 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo bizarre adventure part 9 the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks better than the new Star Wars movie. I hope the good guys win WW II this time.
tL4McUzXfFI,Za Warudo! Hahaha oh shit sorry wrong jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,You can tell the media is going to HATE this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm not trying to be that guy.. but maybe we shouldn't turn the largest war in history that also had a mass genocide into a satirical comedy? A lot of people died.. on all sides..
tL4McUzXfFI,Sono chi no sadame...
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,Wer ist alles Deutsch ? 😅
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is both a JoJo and Marvel reference... nice
tL4McUzXfFI,"You thought this was a jojos reference






Fool you fell for it, thunder cross split attack"
tL4McUzXfFI,😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
tL4McUzXfFI,How disrespectful we are to the jews
tL4McUzXfFI,Za Warudo
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought this was a JoJo Bizzare Adventure trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nobody: 

Skinheads: I felt that"
tL4McUzXfFI,I can't believe Stroheim is in this movie!
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim In in an alternate universe.
tL4McUzXfFI,"As a german, i’m excited to watch this movie because of how different it is from most movies about this era."
tL4McUzXfFI,Guys he found the true Walt Disney
tL4McUzXfFI,After a few weeks you won't find a comment that's not about JJBA
tL4McUzXfFI,"A comedy movie about the horrific events of WWII in the eyes of a boy in Germany, where his imaginary friend is hitler and he finds a Jewish girl in his closet. A very fun and creative way to represent these events throughout history. Will definitely give it a watch."
tL4McUzXfFI,Interesting idea very intriguing
tL4McUzXfFI,"Omg I remember that little Jew girl on here, she used to do acting on Shortland Street as that little Ruby girl who died of cancer."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, Hitler as the jerk bad guy, amazingly brave. Drugs are m,kay."
tL4McUzXfFI,Can’t wait for the new jojo siwa movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Bro wtf Netflix adapted Part 2?

tL4McUzXfFI,Fucking brilliant
tL4McUzXfFI,Bizarre Adventures.
tL4McUzXfFI,Here we go again американцы со своим тупым юмором
tL4McUzXfFI,As terrible as this looks I'm just impressed you bastards are using actual swastikas instead of a cross
tL4McUzXfFI,Is the girl supposed to be Anne Frank ?
tL4McUzXfFI,"SCARLETT, TAIKA"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Is that just me who thinks that it's fucked up to think that this is funny? Can we not make comedys out of tragedies please. The second worldwide war wasn't a joke. If you tell a story in a ""funny"" way, people will think it wasn't even that big of a deal."
tL4McUzXfFI,Best Birthday gift EVER
tL4McUzXfFI,Ah shit here we go again!
tL4McUzXfFI,Isnt this the same music from the last episode of regular show?
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF is JoJo and why is the comment section obsessed? Is it an Australia thing?

tL4McUzXfFI,CEASER
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi  does Wes Anderson?
tL4McUzXfFI,The amount of JOJO memes that are going to come....
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh boy here comes the Stando users
tL4McUzXfFI,The Fox channel is all types of f@#$ed up.
tL4McUzXfFI,I like how Disney put the nazi movie under the Fox label. 👍
tL4McUzXfFI,Man this live action adaptation of jojo is going to be lit
tL4McUzXfFI,"If you guys didn't know, the director is Korg off Thor: Ragnarok"
tL4McUzXfFI,"They used the German version of ""Heroes"" 😍😍😍 and even the isolated guitar riff by Robert Fripp I LOVE IT"
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh? So you’re approaching me?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler and friends to through a fun adventure to train to save their amazing country the movie 




I'm joking please don't kill me"
tL4McUzXfFI,1939 First Nazi comedy from Berlin *colorized and HD*
tL4McUzXfFI,the opening should be so no chi no sadame
tL4McUzXfFI,BRRRAKAMONOGA
tL4McUzXfFI,This is either going to establish Taika as one of Hollywood's greatest directors today or completely bury his career. Either way the world is too sensitive for this type of humour today.
tL4McUzXfFI,What part in WW2 is it set
tL4McUzXfFI,Aren’t the Germans offended by this tho? 🤔
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope this is good.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Taika is good actor/director , i hate zionist jews for what they are doing with Palestinian. but i can watch this movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"christ I don't even know how to feel, all I feel is OUCH"
tL4McUzXfFI,Yes Taika!!! I can't wait to watch it.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this jojo bizzare adventure part 9 ?
tL4McUzXfFI,who else thinks taika waititi 's hitler is his imaginary friend
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo: Führers bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,loving the German rendition of smash-mouths Believer at the beginning.
tL4McUzXfFI,wouldve been better if it wasnt the guy from good boys
tL4McUzXfFI,sher gut
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm impressed that I knew it was I'm a believer but in German :)
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a Jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Thats not even hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,When will this anime show?
tL4McUzXfFI,Black Widow is NoobMaster69 confirmed
tL4McUzXfFI,Must be watched!
tL4McUzXfFI,"-Normal people: What the fuck? I don’t understand why the is a lot of people comenting weird things...

tL4McUzXfFI,"If I see a girl like that in my basement, I'll fap"
tL4McUzXfFI,👍🏿
tL4McUzXfFI,You da man taika
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm waiting for that Isekai where a heavily armed SS Patrol on the Eastern Front encounter a mist and drive into the Dungeons & Dragons universe where they fight dragons, wizards, trolls, and establish their own little humans-only Dictatorship."
tL4McUzXfFI,"STAND USER: JOJO RABBIT
STAND NAME: NAZI PLATINUM"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Movie industry ""we are mak...""
Rebel ""yes!!!"""
tL4McUzXfFI,This video has changed my whole perspective on nazis.
tL4McUzXfFI,Every god-damn Indy film will always have Heroes by David Bowie playing in it and it will always be good.
tL4McUzXfFI,I really don't know if the death of 22 million to 30 million people is funny it could be as high as 50 million definitely 50 million wounded so I just don't know if a movie about Hitler and world war 11 is funny
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF was that??
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,80% of Jojo comments are about the fact that 90% of the comments are Jojo comments
tL4McUzXfFI,This video is trending for the wrong reason
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so relevant seeing as nazi's are as much a fictional joke in this movie as they are in liberals' minds.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Love how people are talking about Disney worrying about Taika making this film, yet gloss over the fact that Scarlett Johansson is in the film too. Oh No! Not Black Widow right?"
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo Part 9 looks pretty weird
tL4McUzXfFI,Good to  see some bravery in film making
tL4McUzXfFI,I love this trailer. The most unrealistic thing in it however was the squad of Germans retreating in a truck that actually had fuel in it.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh my god, finally a movie about the hitler youth"
tL4McUzXfFI,Haha get it because jojo's bizarre adventure had nazis too and this movie is called jojo so time to reference it non stop ecksdee. Movie looks alright.
tL4McUzXfFI,this feels extremely weird
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo part 9 confirmed
tL4McUzXfFI,This actually looks pretty good
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie is horrible and should be banned, complete disrespect to history and how Nazi party actually operated"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Satire at it's best! I can't wait, I love Taika Waititi's humor"
tL4McUzXfFI,So we skipped parts 6-8 and went to 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Where can I find those German song covers?
They're awesome! :D"
tL4McUzXfFI,JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJOOOOO
tL4McUzXfFI,Been done to death...
tL4McUzXfFI,That kid with the glasses has to be Nick Frost's child. Looks so much like him.
tL4McUzXfFI,"*「Stand User」: JoJo Rabbit*

tL4McUzXfFI,I want to watch!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Joseph joestar Secret techniques activated: RUN
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,"So cool to see directors like Waititi  trying something so risky, I think it open doors for other directors who may want to try things just as risky but are afraid to."
tL4McUzXfFI,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChDQOStGrO2kG6rx7ehMd4g/videos
tL4McUzXfFI,should have casted Fred Armisen as hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,*JoJo Rabbit's bizarre Adventure*
tL4McUzXfFI,My  Rabbi wants to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,How the fuck are they getting away with making this?
tL4McUzXfFI,Where is DIO......?!
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo Part 9 teaser
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to make JOJO joke.....
tL4McUzXfFI,Poooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooey!
tL4McUzXfFI,Well that looks awful
tL4McUzXfFI,Hans landa need to check that house real quick
tL4McUzXfFI,Man the next JoJo live action movie looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare yare
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t get it are all the people the natsis and the girl is a Jew? (Sos couldn’t spell it right).
tL4McUzXfFI,"Like there is nothing to make a movie on...
I'm not gonna watch it. That's for sure."
tL4McUzXfFI,SHIZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
tL4McUzXfFI,So what i learned is that you should embrace the hitler inside you ?
tL4McUzXfFI,This like the anime Jojo bizarre adventures
tL4McUzXfFI,I like Taika and his perspective on things. Looks pretty cool. 🤗🤗😘😘
tL4McUzXfFI,PREPARE ZE UV LIUGHTSSS ZIEZ WULL BE SSURRE TO STOP UM
tL4McUzXfFI,I AM SO CONFUSED TO WHY IS HITLER GIVING ADVICE TO THIS 9 yrs old
tL4McUzXfFI,Another shit again
tL4McUzXfFI,Only on the third watch did I realise these songs are being sung in German.
tL4McUzXfFI,Maybe the third act will reveal the nazis are horrible monsters. I mean I don’t think this film tries to redeem or glamorise nazis. I mean obviously the kid will be shown what the nazis have actually done to Jews and he’ll realise the nazis are the bad guys.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is not the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Marvel crossover I expected
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika is a f@#$#n genius.
tL4McUzXfFI,Director = (((Taika Waititi)))
tL4McUzXfFI,I honestly cannot imagine where the fuck did this movie idea come from.
tL4McUzXfFI,Waititi knows how to make some great films for sure
tL4McUzXfFI,Idk how to feel like a comedy about holocaust
tL4McUzXfFI,With everyone being called a Nazi these days this is quite appropriate time to desensitize some folks that are to sensitive I have a Jewish friend who can't wait to see this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"In the ending he snitches to nazis his mom is saving a jew in thier house and they execute both of them. 




That was the reality back then."
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy shit this is real I thought my friend was just good at photoshopping
tL4McUzXfFI,what is Jojo bizzare journey and why is everyone talking about it
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow they really are desperate to get all white people to own this national socialist crap, more propoganda hidden as feel good nonesense!"
tL4McUzXfFI,the kid in the glasses looks like he is Nick Frost's kid
tL4McUzXfFI,Ho? Are you approaching me?
tL4McUzXfFI,I have watched this trailer “NEIN” times already
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a fking good one.
tL4McUzXfFI,"*Bizarre, yes! JOJO, YES!* Needs more Ayayaya"
tL4McUzXfFI,The German version of believer is from Jack White - All deiner Liebe...
tL4McUzXfFI,Holy shit they’re deleting comments like crazy
tL4McUzXfFI,Uhhhh....ok
tL4McUzXfFI,"Comedy with Hitler *laughter*




Media ""are you alive so was Hitler"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh shit this is gonna be depressingly sad I can feel it
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid in the glasses looks a bit like a young Nick Frost.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hey Disney! Stephen Miller called, he wants his Führer fan fiction back. Also, he's not happy with the Jewish girl and how she's portrayed."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks cute... but, not to get all butthurt about this, but aren't there still living survivors of the holocaust? When did that become a fun, cute little setting for a movie? Idk, I guess I just can't forget all that, even for an off-brand Wes Anderson flick."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't like to get political... 
But... What the fuck is a Bird?"
tL4McUzXfFI,We are genuinely blessed to be alive at the same time as Taika Watiti
tL4McUzXfFI,I can't believe they made a film about PewDiePie!
tL4McUzXfFI,When giornio activated golden experience requiem diavolo was in the shop blown up by the kid in glasses
tL4McUzXfFI,"""it's definately not a good time to be a nazi"" equally good advice in 1945 and 2019"
tL4McUzXfFI,I was kinda expecting to find some triggered libtards but What I find instead are a bunch of damn weeaboos
tL4McUzXfFI,I think this proves that Waititi can make the Black Widow movie into a comedy actually work
tL4McUzXfFI,What's up guy's ?
tL4McUzXfFI,"The cinematography reminded me of Swiss Army Man, but I don’t see any relation crew-wise."
tL4McUzXfFI,No stands I am very disappointed
tL4McUzXfFI,Was I the only one looking for jojo the anime and stumbled across this instead it’s bizarre 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m so confused but I wanna watch this
tL4McUzXfFI,"Getting Nacho Libre vibes, but not in a good way..."
tL4McUzXfFI,All im thinking is flammmen waithfer
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf... The only good Nazi is a dead Nazi.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Why do I get Wes Anderson vibes from almost everything in this trailer? The colours, costumes, writing, song choice, humour. This looks almost exactly like Moonrise Kingdom but the Nazi version. Guess we’ll see though"
tL4McUzXfFI,I was waiting for JOJO performance.
tL4McUzXfFI,1:23 first tought was it's Georgiy Deliev
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a pretty bizarre adventure.
tL4McUzXfFI,#noty
tL4McUzXfFI,2:00 I laughed so hard
tL4McUzXfFI,"We shouldn’t be making fun of stuff like this. WW2 shouldn’t be known as a child’s movie. People really died, and many people suffered at this time."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jojo: I better check behind the walls for Jews.

Jewish Girl: Oh?  You're approaching me?"
tL4McUzXfFI,The part that confused me is if Hitler's is his imagination then who is leading the Germans
tL4McUzXfFI,I wish somebody made a movie about the book German Boy that would make my year
tL4McUzXfFI,KONO DIO DA....
tL4McUzXfFI,"As a Jew, if people get offended I will be pissed"
tL4McUzXfFI,How TF did this get on trending?
tL4McUzXfFI,How am I just hearing of this

tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo's control the media
tL4McUzXfFI,"Please vote in 2020, or else we'll keep gettin' bullshit."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is bad jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,What a giant ball of shit 😂 who green lighted this mess? And the cast? 🤮
tL4McUzXfFI,It should be definitely blocked to watch in 248 countries. There are a lot of better movies.
tL4McUzXfFI,So Taika is trying to emulate Wes Anderson?  Looks good.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is my least favorite joestar
tL4McUzXfFI,well Max and Leo are at it again.
tL4McUzXfFI,If David Bowie was a German pop star
tL4McUzXfFI,"-a movie about nazi: ow cool thats rare these days

tL4McUzXfFI,"Omg, this looks so good. 😂I can’t wait!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"As a descendant of Jews who died in Auschwitz and as a JJBA fan, *AND* as a Waititi fan...it is genuinely sad to see people feel so offended by a *SATIRE* because I'm hyped for this now."

tL4McUzXfFI,This movie *L I T E R A L L Y* has Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I did nazi it coming!
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I have the feeling this project started as a screenplay for a Calvin and Hobbes film.
tL4McUzXfFI,Most of the comments are full of jojo refrences
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie seems way too political to be taken seriously
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally Black Widow talks with her comic accurate accent!
tL4McUzXfFI,"3% Comments About  Movie

tL4McUzXfFI,"They misspelled, miscast, and missed out on the best Nazi. STROHEIM."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Taika, I love you."
tL4McUzXfFI,The biggest plot twist is when they showed Hitler was his imaginary friend
tL4McUzXfFI,If I can’t make you laugh block me if I can subscribe 🤟🤪🤪
tL4McUzXfFI,"damn, a lot of these comments are getting repetitive.. i see the same type of comments on every video."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Me: “Mom can we see this movie?”

Mom: “What’s it about?”

Me: “It’s a comedy about Adolf Hitler.”

Mom: “What?”"
tL4McUzXfFI,So Hitler is the little boys imaginary friend?
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm giving it three days. This trailer is going to piss off AAAAAÀAAAAAALLLLL the sjws
tL4McUzXfFI,(-_-)
tL4McUzXfFI,OMFG We’re finally going to see Stroheim’s backstory!!!!! I guess he had a Stand after all
tL4McUzXfFI,"Bowie, nice"
tL4McUzXfFI,I've seen more Nazi sympathizers get mad at this movie than SJW's
tL4McUzXfFI,I feel like this could become my favorite movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Song is believer by smash mouth btw
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow so many JoJo comments now this does put a smile on my face. Also brings a tear to my eye.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Uh,oh: n*zis. YouTube better demonetize this video."
tL4McUzXfFI,They kinda look like germans
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this the new season for jojo?
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh i get it his names jojo haha
tL4McUzXfFI,Reminds me of a Wes Anderson movie.  Can't wait!
tL4McUzXfFI,Why was this movie made??? Who in their right mind thought this was a good idea???
tL4McUzXfFI,"It’s 2019 and a satirical movie based on nazi’s is currently #6 on trending... totally advertising friendly compared to the rest of YouTube. This is perfect irony, and I LOVE IT."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh boy they are going to be in big trouble for this... hurry everyone, plug your ears... they are coming."
tL4McUzXfFI,в россии наверно запретят к показу ?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Funny movie about funny nazzi.  Oh, yeah.. It's very funny"
tL4McUzXfFI,Congratulations.  I no longer need to see the movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Didn’t expect Calvin and Hobbes to go Nazi, but ok!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"The Springtime for Hitler we've always needed.

I'm proud of my culture, my people, and my country . . . I don't believe it should become a morass of cultures and languages, and values. I don't care if other countries do it and I don't think my culture is superior; I don't want to hurt anyone and I don't condone violence at all;  I just prefer to participate in the continuity of my own culture. You know what happens if I say this out loud anywhere?  I end up doing this:
 
  ""What are you people looking at? You're all a bunch of jerks--you know why? You don't have the guts to admit who you are. You need me. 
   You need me so you can point at me and say 'that's the bad guy'. What does that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide and lie. 
    Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth . . . say good-bye to the 'bad guy'; go back to your enclaves to your own people and tell everyone you saw 
    the bad guy--the Caucasian nationalist blabbering about his country again""."

tL4McUzXfFI,"They wanted to see if you would throw your money at a literal ""Springtime for Hitler"" that sanitizes the holocaust and the nazi youth corps, and portrays the german people and soldiers as well meaning victims. Considering you're all just mindlessly parroting Jojo's Bizarre Adventure memes because the word ""Jojo"" is in the title, it's clear that your brains are close enough to applesauce for this to work."

I LOVE IT"
tL4McUzXfFI,Calvin and Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,Since when did jojos bizarre adventures become irl
tL4McUzXfFI,Twat
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this jojo's last bloodline?
tL4McUzXfFI,This has potential. And Waititi has not disappointed yet
tL4McUzXfFI,“We didn’t expect the third ritch to show up”
tL4McUzXfFI,"I find this extremely offensive!!!!!!!  Taika Waititi is part of our elitist neo-liberal controlled movie industry/media in New Zealand.   Our government is corrupt and drives children and abuse victims to suicide ON PURPOSE - we are No 1 in the western world for driving children to suicide, women self-harming, eating disorders, domestic/flatmate violence and of course homelessness.  

Waititi participates in govt neo-liberal based suicide prevention propaganda, where they actually incite more suicide than they ever prevent AND LOTS OF SELF-RIGHTEOUS IGNORANT PEOPLE MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT.   And lots more are in charities and mentally ill people thinking they are going to fix people who want to commit suicide.

Most mentally ill people who think they are going to fix all suicides are actually dysfunctional people who have no friends - for good reason - they latch on to suicidal people (who are normal and suffering because of poverty, homelessness and unemployment caused by 30 yrs of neo-liberal economic reforms that were in fact ILLEGAL UNDER NZ AND INTERNATIONAL LAW).  Check out my youtube channel about the reality of living in this neo-liberal hell hole country.

You will also find a post I did outside Peter Jackson's house and I've just worked out where that American cultural vampire James Cameron lives and intend to do a protest outside his house as well and outside the business of his spoilt brat rich kids.  A news story about how people don't like Cameron because he is growing organic veges rather than meat was the biggest load of BS PROPAGANDA I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.   They found some stupid hick to be in the story BUT VAST MAJORITY OF NEW ZEALAND LOCALS DESPISE CAMERON FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.

Firstly he came to NZ and drove local people off the land so he could buy it - only foreigners can afford land here now after our govt impoverished 80% of the local population.  

2nd he is a cultural vampire - which means artists/playwrights/writers like myself will never be able to make any money from our creativity.   We won't be able to convince anybody our ideas are what people actually want to (and need to) watch, so we won't get funding also we will never have the audience.   People spend their money going to see THE BIG MOVIES about BS.  Its a cultural genocide run by greedy globalists - trying to destroy individual cultures in countries like New Zealand.

Taika Waititi is an embarrassment to most New Zealanders, its only marketing and publicity to naïve people that gets him any recognition.   He's part of the suicide promotion industry, once he hears what I know about what's happening I'm sure he'll expose it - many of the people who are committing suicide are 'sensitive' artists who can't get work.   Many rich powerful people just dont' understand or want to understand what is happening.  IF they knew what I knew they would help me stop what is going on.   I want my own culture back, I want to hear and see the art of local people, born here (whatever colour they are) I AM SICK TO DEATH OF THE AMERICAN AND GLOBAL BS EVERYBODY IS GETTING SHOVED DOWN THEIR THROAT.   IT IS SOOOOOO BORING and does not reflect what is happening in our country."

tL4McUzXfFI,I'm amazed that YouTube allowed this to show alot of that flag
tL4McUzXfFI,"So is this a comedy, a drama, a romantic, or a very weird combo of all 3"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going the be amazing!
tL4McUzXfFI,am i the only one who thinks this looks bad? like the comedy isn’t that good and it’s a rip off of wes anderson
tL4McUzXfFI,German science is the best in the world!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,This is racist. Clearly a colored man in white face. I demand an apology and reparations for all white people.

tL4McUzXfFI,"What does this have to do with ""JoJo"" I'm so confused"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Now this is a ""Jojo bizzare adventure"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm so disappointed, I thought it was Jim Carrey Playing Hitler when I watched this."
tL4McUzXfFI,Nein
tL4McUzXfFI,Im so dead rn😂🔫
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA......!!!!

tL4McUzXfFI,"Natasha Romanoff died and was reincarnated into a Nazi during World War II.

The biggest disrespect to her character"
tL4McUzXfFI,"*Ah, this movie will be very welcome in Germany.*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"2:09 ""Definitely not a good time to be a Nazi""
Willkommen 2019."
tL4McUzXfFI,"2:01

Now we need him to scream DIO"
tL4McUzXfFI,Yeah I'm sure Jews look just like us.
tL4McUzXfFI,D4C?
tL4McUzXfFI,Ihave no idea what I just watched but I need to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,New jojo seson is pretty fucking weird
tL4McUzXfFI,Ridiculous
tL4McUzXfFI,"“You can’t show swaztikas nowadays”
“Everyone is so soft nowadays”

Bruh just stop bitching about people bitching"
tL4McUzXfFI,i like the kraut version of Heroes they had in the trailer tbh
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh my god the kids with the panzershreck part absolutely obliterated me!😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,"“Nothing makes sense anymore”
“Nothing here makes sense except that nothing makes sense”"
tL4McUzXfFI,I think Hitler in this movie is an imaginative friend
tL4McUzXfFI,Lol
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m a Jew and I approve of this message
tL4McUzXfFI,Think I'll hop on this JoJo bandwagon by letting u all know that I've been rewatching battle tendency with my friend who's just now getting into JoJo and it's been fantastic so this is great timing
tL4McUzXfFI,You Fool!! German Movies are the best in the world.
tL4McUzXfFI,"JOJO'S BIZZARE ADVENTURES!

BRAKKA MONOGA!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Due to Cats, a Nazi uniform is still only the second scariest costume Rebel Wilson will be wearing in a movie this fall."
tL4McUzXfFI,i did nazi this coming
tL4McUzXfFI,You can't make a movie about nazis with a protagonist named JoJo and not expect all these mf Jojo references.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a jojo referense?
tL4McUzXfFI,What the... did I just watch?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I completely forgot Disney bought Fox.

Are you happy now everyone? Is this what you guys wanted?
A movie that is “original” and not “remakes” 

Jesus you can’t satisfy everyone. Just demand and demand and never THANK the ones who grant you your entertainment. 
Just another typical American self centered ego"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Needs some work on the jokes, but I can definitely see potential."
tL4McUzXfFI,I have a feeling I’m going to like this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,*_3WORDS: SEAL🇺🇸TEAM🇺🇸SIX._*
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ahh yes.. Lets keep pushing the ""White"" propaganda agenda..Amazing how easy it is to manipulate and control the population..."
tL4McUzXfFI,Hunt for the Wilderpeople is amazing as well.  A lot of humor and heart.
tL4McUzXfFI,jojos bizzare adventure part 9!
tL4McUzXfFI,I like it
tL4McUzXfFI,OMG this looks absolutely insane!
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 2 in a nutshell
tL4McUzXfFI,"muda muda muda

Guys laugh it’s from Jojo"
tL4McUzXfFI,What did I just watch????
tL4McUzXfFI,Moonrise Reichdom?
tL4McUzXfFI,Pedowood is keeping nazism alive
tL4McUzXfFI,That fat kid remind me of Nick Frost
tL4McUzXfFI,3.4 thousand people are Nazis...
tL4McUzXfFI,Plot twist: The opening credits is gonna be bloody stream and the secret antagonist are the piller men
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait!
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,"You expected a Jojo reference but it was me, Imaginary Adolf Hitler!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"So if Hitler is his imaginary friend, does that make Hitler his stand?"
tL4McUzXfFI,what does jojo rabbit have to do with this ?!?!
tL4McUzXfFI,"I saw the thumbnail and thought ""Oh wow haha I almost thought that was Hitler Youth jumping around with Hitler, looking closer that's probably just a boy scouts movie or something""

So glad I was wrong."
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi took a break form Akria to film this. So magical.
tL4McUzXfFI,when is Stroheim supposed to appear?
tL4McUzXfFI,AWAKEN MY MASTERS
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a movie I really want to see this year!
tL4McUzXfFI,the kid is one of my best friends hehe
tL4McUzXfFI,Lame
tL4McUzXfFI,"Can't wait for the ""wokes"" to bash this movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,Freaking jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,Making a movie with hitler are you crazy
tL4McUzXfFI,and his stand is ::: HITLER!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,BORING!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,This still doesnt look good to me.  Looks like hes trying to be Wes Anderson.
tL4McUzXfFI,Great....more trash
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do the main boys at the end remind me of Ralph and Piggy from Lord of the Flies?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Who here is offended by this film's premise? And if so, why?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm a simple man.. I see Taika Waititi, I like."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Y’all jojo fans are gay as hell ruining everyone’s life with your “jojokes” Christ that has to be the most pathetic anime fan group, maybe one piece is more pathetic but that’s it"
tL4McUzXfFI,how horrible things can be presented as good =Taika Waititi AVE
tL4McUzXfFI,As a Jew I’m like wth
tL4McUzXfFI,"Being the history nerd I am, I am so hyped for this movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jojo fans try to insert themselves into everything so I am going to start saying, “is that a JoJo reference” in reference to this movie. Fuck you JJBA fans"
tL4McUzXfFI,What is it with people referring to themselves as 'JoJo'? There's like 3 different people and one TV show that use the name but it apparently isn't copyright yet.
tL4McUzXfFI,Anne frank hide and seek champion
tL4McUzXfFI,Where in ZA WARUDO is ma boi Dio???
tL4McUzXfFI,"""This movie is gonna make Nazis out of people and make people think Nazis are people!""
Well, 1 - Nazis are people, and 2 - I doubt watching a satirical film will suddenly destory human common sense."
tL4McUzXfFI,dirty deeds done dirt cheap
tL4McUzXfFI,Song name?
tL4McUzXfFI,Is the trailer music I'm a believer?
tL4McUzXfFI,in the movie is it hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,Probs gonna get cancelled
tL4McUzXfFI,"Man, for supposed genociders, jewish hollywood has such a hard on for hitler and the national socialists."
tL4McUzXfFI,How isn’t this Wes Anderson?
tL4McUzXfFI,PART 9 IS FINALLY HERE
tL4McUzXfFI,When you watch nacho libre in German subtitles..
tL4McUzXfFI,As a bunny should I be a Nazi???
tL4McUzXfFI,If somebody gets offended—
tL4McUzXfFI,I really need to watch this
tL4McUzXfFI,THIS IS SO GREAT LMAO
tL4McUzXfFI,So JoJo is like the modern left...he sees Hitler everywhere.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Dude, I'm fucking hyped for this movie ngl"
tL4McUzXfFI,probably more misinformation about the National Socialists
tL4McUzXfFI,David Bowie - heroes but maybe some German version but still COOL!
tL4McUzXfFI,Does anyone know the second song they use? I really want to listen to to outside of the trailer.
tL4McUzXfFI,A funny nazi movie. finaly
tL4McUzXfFI,I always wanted to know more about Stroheim's background
tL4McUzXfFI,I really got some questions.
tL4McUzXfFI,Who else clicked on this for the jojo’s bizzare adventure comments?
tL4McUzXfFI,This will be awesome. The trailer looks hysterical
tL4McUzXfFI,"Right when Disney buys out Fox they come our with this, huh"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I feel like Hollywood is beating a dead horse at this point. I mean come on, it's been three quarters of a century, we get it, let it go."
tL4McUzXfFI,Ugh im dissapointed in being apart of the Jojo's community
tL4McUzXfFI,His Stand is Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks fantastic. I love that even this long after ww2 we still making propoganda films lol.
tL4McUzXfFI,Disappointingly shit looking
tL4McUzXfFI,Germans be like 😶
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn I hope its as anti PC as I hope it would be , pls let it be pls"
tL4McUzXfFI,Song name is Mit All Deiner Liebe for all those searching. You're welcome.
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone else watch this thinking there was a chance this would be about Jojo’s Bizzare Adventure?
tL4McUzXfFI,If no one will say it then I will. This is all Trumps fault for normalizing nazi intentions and racism. The influence is so strong that even I am going to watch the movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Petition to make this movie canon for Stroheim’s backstory
tL4McUzXfFI,Not a fan sorry this is sugar coating what Germans have done
tL4McUzXfFI,I've said it once and I'll say it again: this is just Moone Boy with Nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,"2:02 

GERMAN ENGINEERING IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is bad!!!! It’s making me like hitler and I don’t want to like him!!!☹️🤯🥺😭😭
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like the Jewish half of Taika Waititi's personality is finally getting to make a film
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks like if moonrise kingdom was set in the 1940’s and the kid from up wasn’t a boyscout, but hitlerjugend 😂 that kid with glasses really looks like him 😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,I can already see the gov. Banning this
tL4McUzXfFI,love it. gonna be boring during the preachy parts
tL4McUzXfFI,"Kids! It's time to burn some books!

Kids: Yaaaaay!


Favorite quote."
tL4McUzXfFI,"1:23
SHIIZAA??"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Those two kids are mini versions of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the dead) its almost uncanny"
tL4McUzXfFI,WWII isn't funny and never will be. The makers should be ashamed of themselves.
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is going to be a good one hahaha.
tL4McUzXfFI,Glad that the white mass is as strong.
tL4McUzXfFI,On my list.....
tL4McUzXfFI,"Agent: Hi good news I got your kid a part in a movie.
Parent: Oh that's great what's his role?
Agent:well... He'll be a Nazi boyscout during WWll and have Hitler as an imaginary friend.
Parent: oh my....a boyscout how cute."
tL4McUzXfFI,"You thought it was hitler, BUT IT WAS ME DIO"
tL4McUzXfFI,"""its definitely not a good time being a nazi""
- 2017 - 2019 quote"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I really do like Taika Waititi, and I appreciate the fact that he is taking on the image of Hitler in a silly way to really emphasize what this story is about. I have a feeling that despite this movie being adorable, I will be bawling by the end."
tL4McUzXfFI,I really wanna watch this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m trying to understand what new are they trying to show from the nazis this time
tL4McUzXfFI,So this acceptable but heil honey im home isnt
tL4McUzXfFI,Un du hast Erika
tL4McUzXfFI,Its moonrise kingdom but in WW2

tL4McUzXfFI,Dude this movie looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh look, it`s the Führer under my Bett!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Really they couldn't hire actual German actors?!! 🙄🙄
tL4McUzXfFI,Brought tears in my eyes not because of trailer its because Natasha  Black widow
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a JoJo refrence
tL4McUzXfFI,Is ThIs a jOjO reFeRenCe
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't understand the jojo and Disney references. I never watched Disney so can someone explain?
tL4McUzXfFI,Please don’t make hitler adorable
tL4McUzXfFI,Thought that was hitler ngl until I realized it was 🤦🏾‍♂️
tL4McUzXfFI,Im sensing CONTROVERSY !
tL4McUzXfFI,Pucci what did you do?!?!?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I didn't expect the third reich to show up.
-Ceasar"
tL4McUzXfFI,ZA WARUDO!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Got Wes Anderson vibes
tL4McUzXfFI,Im confused what is the jo jo community and what does it have to do with this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,This is fucked up.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Jew Ocean
tL4McUzXfFI,"When you make a movie like this you’ve gotta do it carefully, otherwise you end up with a garbage fire on your hands."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Lmao, what's up with Anne Frank?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"😂This should be funny and entertaining.

TERRANCE OUT"
tL4McUzXfFI,She dies at the end
tL4McUzXfFI,"At first, i thought this was a JOJO bizarre adventure movie 🤔🤔"
tL4McUzXfFI,The chubby kid would be a great Piggy from Lord of The Flies
tL4McUzXfFI,So does this take place in Part 2?
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf is this legal ??
tL4McUzXfFI,"1990’s: in the future i bet it’ll be better than the past 
2019: *hitler movie but less sad* 
Me: wtf"

tL4McUzXfFI,Hot garbage.
tL4McUzXfFI,BRRRRAAAAKAMOROGAAAAA
tL4McUzXfFI,Shrek music
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,It looks so damn good
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf is this crap!?😆😆😆😆😆
tL4McUzXfFI,The Whole movie is JOJO references
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I get the feeling I will be crying at the end of this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nobody:
JoJo fantards: OMg pARt 9 iZ co0l"
tL4McUzXfFI,2:02 Jojo fans in the comment section
tL4McUzXfFI,VON STROHEIM!
tL4McUzXfFI,This is some Bizarre adventures
tL4McUzXfFI,seems this kid's imaginary friend won't be accepted in Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh dawn this is a kiwi movie
tL4McUzXfFI,ooh little Billy Bunter is a nazi
tL4McUzXfFI,Joey Jo-Jo Junior Shabadoo certainly had an odd childhood
tL4McUzXfFI,Just one thing. I don't understand why they have British accents. Did they even try a german one?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is like the Good Boys, but in WW2"
tL4McUzXfFI,"95% of comments: JoJo references

tL4McUzXfFI,Bruh Moment ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally David productions decide to make a back story for stroheim!




But I would have preferred a dugout back story tbh"

tL4McUzXfFI,Оооо пропутинских прорвало
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare Yare Daze ......
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jojo, and his stand, HITLER!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"At first I thought this was going to just be a comedy, but it also looks like it’s going to be serious. I mean, some scenes make it look like it’s going to end in the battle of Berlin, but then again we do see an American M10"
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo:reference !?
tL4McUzXfFI,This high key looks really good
tL4McUzXfFI,*yare yare*
tL4McUzXfFI,"You are not a Nazi, Jojo. You are a *JOESTAR*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Funny, another Jewish made movie making Nazis seem silly and the Jews innocent...when you control to propoghanda but still can't convince the populous your narrative...maybe because stupid movies like this only work for the low IQ."
tL4McUzXfFI,Someone needs to edit this and out the Disney+ logo at the end
tL4McUzXfFI,This is just so wierd. I dont know if I should laugh or cringe. It's like getting a bunch of kids to dress up like ISIS and make a joke about chopping peoples heads off. It's just wrong as fuck. Maybe if it were adults as the protagonist you could play it off as an artsy fartsy movie and it probably wouldve got massive recognition but an outright family movie is wierd as hell
tL4McUzXfFI,Shnaiza
tL4McUzXfFI,"This premise is crazy, but if there's anyone that can make it work it's Waititi."
tL4McUzXfFI,"YES PLEASE KEEP MAKING JJBA JOKES WOW SO FUNNY GUYS I DIDNT GET IT AT FIRST AND THEN I WAS LIKE “OH YEAH, THE KIDS NAME IS JOJO” AND THEN I LAUGHED AND CLAPPED BECAUSE I GOT THE REFERENCE HAHA"

😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,whats the matter with you motherless bitches nowadays?
tL4McUzXfFI,Just more dancing Stormtroopers in an archaic form. Not funny. Never forget.
tL4McUzXfFI,"wow, this is a family-friendly nazi movie i never knew i wanted"
tL4McUzXfFI,Love the Bowie in German. I would guess that’s what it is
tL4McUzXfFI,I think it’s safe to say Taika Waititi is taking up Mel Brook’s torch and is doing great at it!
tL4McUzXfFI,Any dislikes are from snowflake liberals
tL4McUzXfFI,Una historia real increíble https://youtu.be/OkRggNqcAmk
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't understand what I just saw....
tL4McUzXfFI,am I the only one who fears the right will enjoy this?
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid in the glasses is possible going to be a the greatest comic role of all time
tL4McUzXfFI,0:54 I did NAZI that coming
tL4McUzXfFI,Release date?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah so its the book thief, but a comedic take"
tL4McUzXfFI,"You didn’t ask for this, you didn’t choose this. But there it is..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I never laughed harder at a trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,Awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is the Black Widow origin story huh? Interesting!
tL4McUzXfFI,cant wait
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE GREATEST!
tL4McUzXfFI,interesting story \m/
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Jews look just like us"" LMAOOOO"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Came here looking for Jojo, and stayed for the plot."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Too soon
Smh"
tL4McUzXfFI,1:38 “Our grip tightens around the black heart of Berlin. The Führer demands all to shed their last drop of blood in it's defense. The old... the young... the weak. If they stand for Germany... They die for Germany. Building by building... Room by room... One rat at a time.” - Victor Reznov
tL4McUzXfFI,the kids are so cuteeee😍😍😍
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it right to do this?  Wouldn't it be respectful for the actual victims..
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hollywood can do this...
*Yet teaching a dog to do funny Hitler things to troll your girlfriend should be prosecuted.*"
tL4McUzXfFI,I'll literally watch anything if it's directed by   Taika Watiti

tL4McUzXfFI,Moral of the story ...Nazis are fun
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi probably isnt going to reference jojos bizarre adventure in this nazi parody comedy but it would be hilarious if he did
tL4McUzXfFI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHn0Eq0D0x8
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THE BEST DAY EVER!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,2:11 is about when it occurred to me that this kid could either play Harry Potter or young Nick Frost
tL4McUzXfFI,More propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,So how long before this is considered offensive and people are demanding it be taken down?
tL4McUzXfFI,This is not jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this part 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,This is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure right?
tL4McUzXfFI,“It’s definitely not a good time to be a Nazi” 😂😂😂 when is it a good time exactly?
tL4McUzXfFI,Everyone who sees this film will be put on a white supremacist watch list.
tL4McUzXfFI,When you realize that being friend with a Nazi is a Jojo reference...
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait this is non-canon
tL4McUzXfFI,"HAHAHA, JOTARO"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, a movie that will get me off my ass to see it in theaters!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Time to make tons of JoJo references in the comments!
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo’s Bizarre Ad—. Wait a minute....
tL4McUzXfFI,"Me: Well, this looks weird I wonder what the comments say

Jojo Community: This is our comment section now *Awaken my masters*"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Everyone claiming this is racist 
You're wrong it's actually showing 
that we are all the same."
tL4McUzXfFI,"If anyone is interested in this movie's themes I urge you to check out *Life Is Beautiful* by Roberto Benigni as well. 

It has a similar surreal humourous take on Nazis and the Holocaust, and guarunteed will leave you laughing with tears at the end."
tL4McUzXfFI,0:11 - JoJo gets hit with the Stand Arrow.
tL4McUzXfFI,YOU FOOL! GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Im a believer"" but in German?? Lol"
tL4McUzXfFI,People hate Hitler but not me because I know he never want to be what he became he just want to be like Charlie Chaplin but  fate and situation make him  Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,"How is America doing 70+ years after the defeat of the Nazi machine? 

Radical white supremacist terrorist walking the streets of America with Nazi flags, some shooting innocent people and Hollywood feeding more Americans into thinking this was all a joke.. Portraying hitler in a comedic manner.. Sick f***s..

 Did any of the cast or production team have any shame or dignity or is the money just too important ? 😂😂 idk! for a second I liked the orange mutant today - thought he would be great if he really gave it to both houses... 

Its all rather disturbing."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don’t care about anything, I’m going to watch it at any costs.
Even though I’m not German, but I live in Germany.
Down with the racism and this cruel world.
I mean it."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks like the craziest movie ever made😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"just a mockery of the story. cruelly, not funny, stupidly, mockingly, disrespectfully. dislike and complaint. I hope it doesn’t work out, it's awful. laugh at a story in which millions of people died ... horror"
tL4McUzXfFI,I REALLY want to see this movie .
tL4McUzXfFI,"Is this going to be like American History X, where I only like the first half?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is going to be awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,literally what.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Svastika Türkün ""OZ"" damgasıdır."

Yeah sounds good"
tL4McUzXfFI,*I've been waiting for a live action Stroheim movie*
tL4McUzXfFI,"You all thought this was a JoJo reference, but it was I DIO!"
tL4McUzXfFI,So History channel get yelled at for Nazi imagery but JoJo heres okay? What is the demographic for this movie. Like the target audience has to be small. Does Disney know this or are they going on another anti jew crusade again. I just feel like we should be past this kind of movie. I mean i get it. Boy meets Girl. Boy likes Girl but their band or kept from one another but Nazi really. I mean i get that it happened probably but come on.
tL4McUzXfFI,Sooo...this isnt a trailer for Part 7 then?
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare Yare Daze
tL4McUzXfFI,"This reminds me of the movie bamboozle by spike lee. It usurps conventional ideas and shows you WHY you should be angry about the Nazi party. But if the director had been white..this wouldn’t be MADE, just saying!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Its obviously satire you idiots lmao. Millennials are so stupid.
-Gen Z"
tL4McUzXfFI,Desensitization: they should make a comedy about concentration camps too huh? Bet that'd be just fkn hilarious!  😑😑😑
tL4McUzXfFI,what?
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks incredibly good
tL4McUzXfFI,so scarlet can do a german voice but couldn't even try a russian voice as black widow smh.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Watching trailer without audio: ""Well this looks... interesting.""
Watching with audio: ""Actually, this looks RELLY interesting! I think I'll check this o-""
And starring Rebel Wilson: ""I'll wait for the video."""
tL4McUzXfFI,"Somehow I'm both intrigued and repulsed by the very idea of this film, so of course I will watch it. Chaplin made a comedy about (S)hitler DURING WWII, so to me it kinda looks like ""The Great Dictator"" meets ""Drop Dead Fred""."
tL4McUzXfFI,MUDA MUDA MUDA MUD MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA WHY UR MOVIE NAME JOJO MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
tL4McUzXfFI,What a f*ck is that?
tL4McUzXfFI,What is Hollywood's obsession with Nazis... enough... it's just distasteful.
tL4McUzXfFI,Why this move remember my on lazy town?
tL4McUzXfFI,It's a no from me
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika just having fun as usual
tL4McUzXfFI,"0:34 when my classmates are excited to go home

tL4McUzXfFI,Awesome. Let’s cutify Nazis. Just the thing we need right now.
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's frightening because its so , so true."
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo Bizzare Adventure with Nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,German science *is* the best in the world
tL4McUzXfFI,Now this is some Nazi Wholesome content you can get behind.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this movie based off antifa discovering that they are the bad guy? I'd say yes.
tL4McUzXfFI,Steve merchant 😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,how does that kid look exactly like a mini nick frost
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a stand?
tL4McUzXfFI,There's a problem with empathizing with nazis.
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally something fresh
tL4McUzXfFI,"I wish Chris Hemsworth do a cameo in this movie .





That would be so good"
tL4McUzXfFI,"HA, you thought it was going to be a relevant comment but it was me DIO"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Music: ""Jack White - Mit all deiner Liebe"" and ""David Bowie - Helden"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it bad if I say this movie looks good?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is my Cover version
of a very cool and under-known song by Garth Brooks called ""The Devil
Can't Write No Love Song."" Check it out and let me know what you think. https://youtu.be/bsJz6xwysLo"
tL4McUzXfFI,They got some nerve setting a movie in Germany with a main character whose name Germans can’t pronounce.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is gonna end like the Boy in the Striped Pajamas isn't it
Don't do that to me again please"
tL4McUzXfFI,This sounds so bad and unfunny already
tL4McUzXfFI,Song name?
tL4McUzXfFI,NANI?!?
tL4McUzXfFI,Must...refrain from...making...a ....JoJo's Bizarre Adventure...reference!
tL4McUzXfFI,Weird
tL4McUzXfFI,"Looking forward to the commie comedy version after we have watched the nazi version:)

tL4McUzXfFI,Bruh we didn’t die for this to exist
tL4McUzXfFI,"""A jew.""
""Gesundheit.""

Ah... I see what you did there. Clever.

tL4McUzXfFI,Didn’t even know that David Bowie was singing in German until the end 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"IS THIS A GODDAM-
oh wait, not that JoJo"
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks so bad
tL4McUzXfFI,"10% of comments are about the acttual movie
90% of comments are Jojo refrences"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hollywood is obsessed with Nazis.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I came to the comments to figure this movie out, I learned I’m not even part of the humans anymore."
tL4McUzXfFI,https://youtu.be/XlVOJg23QZ0

tL4McUzXfFI,Wes Anderson
tL4McUzXfFI,"Lovely to see that even in complete darkness, there is a light that never goes out. May we all get out of here laughing (and possibly crying) our asses off. 💖💖"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is Hitler a figment of his imagination??
tL4McUzXfFI,Kono Adolf Hitler niwa yumega aru
tL4McUzXfFI,"So the ss runes are offensive but not a swastika, even though this film takes place in history and it’s not glorifying nazis in anyway yet they feel the need to warp the ss runes. Shouldn’t we be able to associate that symbol with evil yet what they are doing is taking away the chance to recognize a popular nazi symbol, I just don’t get it"
tL4McUzXfFI,*JOJO -- please react to the new season of the NETFLIX SHE-RA cartoon and new Target exclusive SHE-RA dolls.*
tL4McUzXfFI,"You know, I like that they present her coming out of the hole in the wall like it's a horror movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,show too much content in a trailer why
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is going to be fucking fantastic, I can’t wait"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jesus, no one gives a sh!t... why are we always focusing on the jews and ww2? Every fn movies has some agenda, and people seem to be so blind to it."
tL4McUzXfFI,As a jew. I think this movie is a piece of shit trying to make Nazi's seem like people. They are not.
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't get the JoJo reference? help me understand
tL4McUzXfFI,I keep thinking that Scarlett Johansson is going to start backflipping and throwing punches 😂💀
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks good
tL4McUzXfFI,"My interest in this movie started because ""HAHA, IT'S A JOJO AND HIS 「STAND」IS HITLER,"" but this movie is actually shaping up to be really interesting."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Any ""did Nazi see that coming"" comments yet?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyother German/English people out there who find the song hilarious
tL4McUzXfFI,👏
tL4McUzXfFI,"90%: JoJo fans, 10%: the rest of viewers."
tL4McUzXfFI,Black Widow is alive
tL4McUzXfFI,"The question is, will Disney ban this movie because Hitler is in it and Jews didnt like Hitler? I suddenly remembered the adpocalipse and Scare Pewdiepie 2 after the Fiverr incident..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m glad Disney didn’t cancel this
tL4McUzXfFI,Why
tL4McUzXfFI,I was ready for some crazy fights in the comments but there are only Jojo fans trolling.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm afraid this will be another ""Life is beautiful""... and by afraid I mean I'm not sure I can take another blow like that, but I shall have to try."
tL4McUzXfFI,It looks Interesting if I do say so myself !!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,*He found Anne Frank XD*
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ok so kinda like death of Stalin... an adult horrible history’s thing... 

I think that’s a good idea???"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Knew this was going to be comedy gold when taika watiti showed up. I thought this was going to be a weird Wes Anderson film, but I now know I'm going to love it!"
tL4McUzXfFI,BBBBBBBBBBBRRRAKKAAMOONNOO GAAAAAA
tL4McUzXfFI,Hollywood really running out of ideas it seems
tL4McUzXfFI,If Moonrise Kingdom and Inglorious Bastards had a lovechild
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika.......alright I'm in
tL4McUzXfFI,A feel good movie about Nazis wtf. What’s next a feel good movie about slave owners
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf?!
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh look more propaganda. They’re getting desperate. 😏
tL4McUzXfFI,Best wishes Team “ JOJO RABBIT “
tL4McUzXfFI,STAND POWER: [ I r o n  F u h r e r ]
tL4McUzXfFI,"Looks like a hodgepodge of like a thousand different ideas and tones without any meaning, foundations, or structure. Well, i wouldn't expect more from Taika Waititi after the disaster of Thor: Ragnarok. It also feels like the movie is made based on religious liberal ideas...
All in all, it looks like this is gonna be pure garbage"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Geez I thought JoJo fans weren't insufferable enough, this comment section takes it to a new level. You aren't clever or funny for making a JoJo reference"
tL4McUzXfFI,What is this? Im Jewish c:

Absolutely adore the guy and it's cool to see that people who play in major movies like in the MCU team up in smaller movies as well (Korg, Black Widow and Justin Hammer(tho that's a bit surprising and weird))"

tL4McUzXfFI,I'm getting the interview flash black
tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t wait for this movie.

tL4McUzXfFI,Rudol Von Stroheim’s backstory
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF this isn't the next chapter of Jojolion.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yawn, When are we going to get some movies about the Commies?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is like one of those movies that wouldn’t actually release but you do want it to release but you don’t want it to release
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is trying to soften people response to fascism, as they force it upon us. Cant believe this"

tL4McUzXfFI,*SONO CHI NO SADAME*
tL4McUzXfFI,"Im a bit torn.
On one hand i believe in free speech for all and that nothing is sacred.
But in this case it seems to be a piece of entertainment which does very little to honor its source material. That one being NAZI germany.
I am certain that the nazi's will be portrayed as goof balls and that the boy will learn valuable lessons about how jews are just people.
I will watch it because i hope to see something interesting.
I will also criticize the ever living fuck out of it should it fail to perform to the level required. And dont blame me. Blame Mr Watiti for dancing a very dangerous dance. Should he fail to respect the memory of the holocaust it would be the last movie he ever makes. The jews of Hollywood will eat him alive."
tL4McUzXfFI,LMFAO OMFG 😂😂😂

tL4McUzXfFI,"Siguen gastando millones para hacer películas, y ridiculizar a los nazis... se nota que tienen la constante necesidad de seguir con estos temas, porque aún les duele la masacre que hicieron a pesar de que perdieron.
Los que hacen esta propaganda con fines sionistas me dan mas asco, que los mismos fanaticos nazis!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Almost thought it would be an Anakin and Padme love story for a second there.

tL4McUzXfFI,"Two things came to mind. First, for whom is this film intended for? Two, how are German cinemas going to censor this? I look forward to both answers!"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, I want to see this"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this part 9 tho?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm an Inglorious Bastards kinda guy. Other then that I got nuthin against Hitler. Without him in the 30s Germany would've been doomed to poverty. The man brought a dying economy back to life, that's a fact.

Then him and a few friends went on French holiday in 1939 😂😂😂 We all know how that went lululul"
tL4McUzXfFI,"this is so bizarre
if you get what I said


#speedwagonbestwaifu"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the second time that Jojo is getting involved with Nazis and I never thought that is a sentance I would ever end up saying

tL4McUzXfFI,"Remember that kid in downfall?




This is him before videogames were a thing"
tL4McUzXfFI,omg hitler is actually nice😊
tL4McUzXfFI,"I understand that many people don't really understand what war is about. They don't understand what cruelty means and with time they even start to put important tragic events in doubt... Ignorance is a very bad shit which people are fed with nowadays. But turning such a horrible period into a comedy? Presenting hitlerjugend like it was some God damn boyscout camp??? Its disgusting... Hitlerjugend was an organisation of evil, turning innocent children into bloodthirsty indoctrinated animals."
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim would be proud.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf is this ? This is like giving Nazis a good look 🤷🏻‍♂️ when they must’ve been one the most evil people that walk the earth
tL4McUzXfFI,Nani!!!!???
tL4McUzXfFI,All these jojo comments on a nazi movie ad and no Stroheim jokes? No dignity.
tL4McUzXfFI,Mr. Waititi is a God
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this by any chance canon in the Jojo anime?

tL4McUzXfFI,Wat is dis
tL4McUzXfFI,Lmfao satire at its finest.
tL4McUzXfFI,Bruh how did this movie get approved in 2019?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I think PEDOWOOD has fucked history and our children for long enought. The day of reckoning is coming. When the truth comes out about you demons, the people are gonna wanna stone you."
tL4McUzXfFI,Does this JoJo also take place in the SBR universe or ??
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow this new jojo part looks weird
tL4McUzXfFI,This is an interesting placement for a WW2 nazi germany satire. Not many stories are told about the children in germany during that time. Looks fun. Can't wait for the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"When i see such Nazi movie, it seem anti migration sentiment is rouse and i think it need keep out for alien people."
tL4McUzXfFI,As a german I'm excited as fuckkkkkkkkkk

tL4McUzXfFI,While this movie  does  look like it would  be hilarious. I don't  it will make it to theaters.  I'll  give it a day before  the humorless fascist left see this  and loose their shit over it demanding  that it be pulled because  it Nazi propaganda  or something along those line.  I'll  also give it a day before they star calling  Scarlett Johansson a Nazi sympathizer and go off on her again like they did in the movie  where she played a transgender person and in Ghost in the Shell. God why can we have  nice things?
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 looks good

tL4McUzXfFI,"The irony...
Pewdiepie: *makes Nazi jokes*

Media: *makes a nazi humor film*
Also Media: I approve of this"
tL4McUzXfFI,Somebody is living in the third walls
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo fans are real predictable just saying
tL4McUzXfFI,The quirky indie holocaust comedy you didn’t know you wanted!

Churchill: I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer."

tL4McUzXfFI,"awww goshhh, this makes me happy!! :'))"
tL4McUzXfFI,😂 😂 😂 👌
tL4McUzXfFI,This seems very distasteful. Not something to make a movie out of considering millions of people lost their lives to this pos.
tL4McUzXfFI,I hate jews so much
tL4McUzXfFI,By Hollywood's own standards they are all Nazis and should be fired immediately becaise leftists dont believe in context. Bunch of hypocrites.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this anime?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Why the fuck would you make a movie like this? I'm polish and find this extremely offensive. You better not let this movie go to Theaters or you will see Poland, or any other country affected by Germanys terror during Hitler's time, want to start a war just like that dumb fucking movie The Interview did to Kim. You people should truly be ashamed. Fucking cannot believe what the media and movie industry is allowing to pass these days. Absolutely GARBAGE. Fuck you for making this movie and fuck the actors involved! Never going to waste my money on them again."
tL4McUzXfFI,I actually like it seems funny and more open minded to different views and struggles of others not like you
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie's trailers keep making me laugh.
tL4McUzXfFI,I like how Hitler acts so normal and not like the psychological maniac we know him for.
tL4McUzXfFI,Son of Shtrohaim ?
tL4McUzXfFI,Netflix needs to take notes on how to make trailers from these guys
tL4McUzXfFI,“its definitely not a good time to be a nazi” 🤣🤣Wtf
tL4McUzXfFI,"Loved it, Hope this brings happiness to everyone involved..."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is very controversial for many, but this is fictional comedy and no one’s denying the evilness of what happened by the Nazi. I would like to see how the story will turn out"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, sure as hell all the producers are jewish"
tL4McUzXfFI,It will be a humorous and emotional journey
tL4McUzXfFI,My nickname is jojo so this is weird
tL4McUzXfFI,Hollywood strikes again.  Good to know what LA thinks of American citizens
tL4McUzXfFI,"Thats how you make NAZI so awsome again, good work Amerika!...
So whats about al Qaida, ISIS, Slavery, Racism, you know the usual stuff 
To soon... to soon..."

tL4McUzXfFI,JOJO RABBIT BETTER THAN GOOD BOYS 🤓👍
tL4McUzXfFI,"-A Jew
-Gesundheit
Oscar nominated"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yes, Hollywood is right. The Germans followed Hitler because “they wanted to be part of a club”, not because they and their children were being forced into prostitution by the Jewish Oligarchs that bought up Berlin and large parts of Germany, after they betrayed the German people for the Balfour Declaration and the promise of Israel during WWI.

Also, the Germans started WWII in 1939, not the self Proclaimed International Jewry, who met and published a front page article in the New York Times in 1933, titled “International Jewry Declares War on Germany”. It was definitely the Germans who were the Warmongers though, not the victims of the US Federal Reserve and Zionist Elites.

Gotta love how these Hollywood Jews frame history in their Monthly Anti-German propaganda videos lol 😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope that they show that the bucks they are burning is actually hard core pornography and communist propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,God I hate this fandom

tL4McUzXfFI,Warum sehe ich hier englischsprechende Nationalsozialisten?!
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm not sure about this, making a children's movie with Nazi overtones, turning it into a comedy.
My problem is there's nothing funny at all about Nazis or Hitler! Not so sure they should be presented in a 'comical light'. There are those that believe Hitler should be totally off-limits in art and culture, and they are probably right."
tL4McUzXfFI,F

tL4McUzXfFI,"This was great, until Rebel Wilson appeared. Now I'm sad."
tL4McUzXfFI,Zis mutsi be very interesting
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jojo part 9 leaked footage
He has the joestar blood in him
I can sense his stand"
tL4McUzXfFI,Wes Anderson has entered the chat
tL4McUzXfFI,"Id be interested were it not for Hollywood types continuously trying correlate Nazis and Fascism with conservatives and right wing ideologies which is frankly asinine. 

Otherwise it looks funny, but Im betting on anti right wing rhetoric showing up rather than just good ol making fun of bastard Nazis. 
Its all I have come to expect from the deranged lunatics in Hollywood"
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF???
tL4McUzXfFI,This one looks like 12 years old Tarantino's movie :)
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Don't get into the Nazi shit"" Taika Waititi  2010. Nine years later..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm sure all the Americans who lost their lives to this world war would find this amusing. That's sarcasm. Fuck this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,the kid with the glasses is probably going to be my favourite character lol
tL4McUzXfFI,Has Wes Anderson vibe to it
tL4McUzXfFI,Van stroheim the movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"I’m happy with this comment section, like if agree make a JoJo reference if you really agree"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hey it actually seems fun even whit or whitout polítics envolved
tL4McUzXfFI,"I just love, Taika Waititi movies, so much. 'What We Do in the Shadows' is absolutely one of my favorite movies ever made. I could watch that movie every single day and never get bored of the film. And this trailer for his new movie looked hilarious to me. So, I am very excited to check this out when it releases. Plus, it's so great in my opinion to see original movies like this that aren't another stupid remake or reboot, coming out. 

Also, that scene where the kid's friend dropped the rocket 🚀, ahahaha 🤣. I thought that was extremely funny. I think I'll go watch What We Do in the Shadows now for umpteenth time."
tL4McUzXfFI,DIE WELT!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,The boy basiclly has a stand😂
tL4McUzXfFI,This garbage give rabbits a bad name. 😫 #bunnyhood 4life 🐇
tL4McUzXfFI,"Definitely a must see movie

tL4McUzXfFI,I think I remember Jojos Bizarre Adventure part 6 quite different
tL4McUzXfFI,Bro... imagine watching this as a Wehrmacht soldier in 1940...
tL4McUzXfFI,Rudol Von Broheim origin story??
tL4McUzXfFI,Funny seeing them trying to speak German
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's like Cards Again Humanity wrote a movie:  The touching story of a young boy who  (Really likes being a Nazi) that discovers (People that live inside the walls). Aided by his imaginary friend (Adolf Hitler) he tries to survive the most difficult part of childhood, (incompetent Hitler Youth)."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks like the oddest JoJo's live action movie yet.  But it looks like they are doing one of the better arcs.  Getting to see Hitler become a vampire and still be alive in present day, use a stand arrow on his secret son President Trump unlocking his stand called ""Kid Rock"" as father and son attempt to obtain the powerful corpse parts from the powerful Ronald Reagan so they can own the world.  It ends up being all up to JoJo to save the world before they use the corpse parts to power up their stand ""Kid Rock"" to it's ultimate level ""Bawitdaba Requiem""."
tL4McUzXfFI,I so thought this was going to be a  Wes Anderson movie when I clicked.
tL4McUzXfFI,Weird
tL4McUzXfFI,Nein nein nein
tL4McUzXfFI,How does the kid look german with his mom being asian
tL4McUzXfFI,"I've been on the edge of my seat waiting, for yet, another WW2 film."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well since this was written based on a book...
On a side note, that is how imaginary friends work out until you get to the rabbit hole."
tL4McUzXfFI,From the creators of Thor🤣🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,"So it’s essentially just Calvin and Hobbes, but instead of a stuffed tiger, we get the literal incarnation of evil? FUCKING SOLD!"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so good! Can’t wait to watch it.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait a Nazi movie that's upbeat and positive where the Germans aren't being killed in the most brutal and bloodthirsty way possible?

This must be the work of an enemy Stand"
tL4McUzXfFI,Now this looks like a good movie! Hopefully it becomes #1 for this year.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Right now, there are three groups main groups reacting to this trailer. One is posting memes, another unironically enjoyed what they saw, and the third is screaming at the top of their lungs instead of posting something in the comment section."
tL4McUzXfFI,We can be heroes
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so freaking messed up and funny at the same time.
tL4McUzXfFI,If only there was a certain gentleman with an abdominal machine-gun cameo in this movie... That would be amazing.
tL4McUzXfFI,Okay.....now let's see how the Jewish community receives this attempt to make light of the Nazis and this era. Astonished this film even got made.  Stay tuned.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, time to bust out the Orange Fanta."
tL4McUzXfFI,From a Canadian North American Native _ Sorry to the Jewish People for this Bullshitt Movie.

tL4McUzXfFI,Omg stop normalizing fascism
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm guessing the Jewish girl is also imaginary.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hay why dose the title look so familiar? Is it a reference to something? I can't put my finger on it yet it's right on the tip of my tongue,🤔 Joe Swanson from family guy no, Joe Rogen maybe ... nah, Joe Pecie when he was a kid? Now that's just stupid; anyways if it ever comes to me I'll edit this comment with the answer in all caps. Ok bye a beautiful time👋👮"

tL4McUzXfFI,Dafuq...did i just see HITLER prancing about like a giddy school chap???😂
tL4McUzXfFI,More depraved Hollywood degeneracy about an 70 year old enemy. Where are the films inspiring humanity to go to the stars and beyond?
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 2 live action be like
tL4McUzXfFI,Yess! Overton window is opening^_^ Few more years and nazism would be hailed as a good deeds and Hitler would rise as a new world hero.

tL4McUzXfFI,"So is this who killed my dad.

tL4McUzXfFI,Funny how people don’t care about rewriting history for the sake of diversity when it comes to Nazis.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm glad Taika's adaption of 'Akira' is on hold indefinitely. Really not his style.

This is most like it."

tL4McUzXfFI,Why isn't there a cyborg nazi named Stroheim that says SpeEEEedWagggoOooOnnn
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't know part 2 was getting a live action remake
tL4McUzXfFI,Trump supporters mad as hell right now

tL4McUzXfFI,"Came expecting JoJokes 
Was not disappointed"
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi is awesome. This looks like the love child of Mel Brooks and Wes Anderson but with Taika’s own unique spin.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wonder what the Germans think
tL4McUzXfFI,that guy with the mustache is a very cool dude
tL4McUzXfFI,Here’s a comment that doesn’t make an anime reference. Do what you will
tL4McUzXfFI,"They can try and rewrite history time and time again , movie after movie, but Jews are still THE fuckin problem.  And you’ll never outrun that. ;)"

tL4McUzXfFI,Yup make being a nazi good again
tL4McUzXfFI,A young nazi falling in love with a Jew during 1940s seems accurate and a friend of hitler totally accurate.
tL4McUzXfFI,If this movie is coming out..... ANTHING can become a movie
tL4McUzXfFI,This doesn't look bad. I might go see it
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo siwa

tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait, a Nazi satire that is ACTUALLY a satire. In 2019? Holy shit who would have guessed. And it doesn't seem like it's ham fisted and going to make some alt-right issues.

tL4McUzXfFI,"I don’t watch anime, I’m so fucking lost in these comments"

tL4McUzXfFI,What in the himmel?
tL4McUzXfFI,what in the fuck did i just watch
tL4McUzXfFI,"What abysmal garbage. The filmmakers hope to make some “powerful points” by dressing them into silly humor?  The Nazis were not buffoons, unfortunately. They were a well organized cult of psychopaths who nearly took over the world. Millions of people died in WWII, including 6 million Jews. And here they give it a Disney movie feel. There are talented filmmakers out there struggling to raise money for good projects. But execs give money for this drek. Sad."
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's?
tL4McUzXfFI,Humanizing Nazis. Cool. We gonna humanize the KKK next?

tL4McUzXfFI,So The hunt gets canceled but kids can dress up as nazis?
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that Jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 looks amazing!
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is nonsense. Can’t believe Hollywood would make this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hope this movie doesn't get backlash from the media cause I would actually want to watch this, just cause it looks like a good movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo part 9 is looking crazy
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks so great.
tL4McUzXfFI,Nah yo
tL4McUzXfFI,If the camp scene of this movie doesn’t have them saying “German science is the greatest in the world!!!.” The this movie doesn’t deserve to have Jojo in it.

tL4McUzXfFI,"Obvious JoJokes aside, this film seems like its going to be a weird cross between The Boy In Stripe Pajamas and Moonrise Kingdom with a couple of the usually Waititi humor used in shit like What We Are in the Shadows and Thor Ragnarok."
tL4McUzXfFI,I laughed way too hard when they showed the Jewish girl with horror film references

Critics: But sir. “THE Community”.

The Producer: Just do it."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really funny. I like stuff that makes fun of Nazis. They deserve to be made fun of. *nazi pug salutes*
tL4McUzXfFI,"Revisionists ignore the fact the Nazis were Fascist-Socialists.... like Bernie, Warren & AOC."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I still disagree with making WWII, especially Nazi themes, comedic"
tL4McUzXfFI,Can we retire Nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,Should have been called Jojos Bizarre Adventure (wait is that taken?)
tL4McUzXfFI,Ohhhhhhh shhhhiet! Smells like a controversy coming up. xP

tL4McUzXfFI,WHO THOUGHT THIS WAS OKAY
tL4McUzXfFI,All I could think of during this was *what the hell kind of drugs is Taika Waititi on?*
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks funny af

Looks ok."
tL4McUzXfFI,I am so sick of Nazis. Get over it.
tL4McUzXfFI,So this JoJo's stand name is [ *Hitler* ]?
tL4McUzXfFI,"While this is satire, it is in effect normalizing WWII and the Nazis. Also great timing... right after the 80th anniversary of the start of WWII. Shame on you Disney!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler""
Honestly, knowing this, i need to see it."
tL4McUzXfFI,the unicorn part killed me.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just what every little kid wants, a Nazi as an imaginary friend!"
tL4McUzXfFI,My type of movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand User: Jojo Rabbit 
Stand Name: 99 Red Balloon"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, a movie that dares to mock Nazis. I wonder how a movie like this got made in Hollywood, and I applaud the filmmakers for their bravery in challenging conventions and delivering an urgent message that has not yet been heard.

Oh, sorry, I was thinking of _The Great Dictator._ Since Nazism ceased to be politically relevant about 75 years ago, this movie either doesn't have a political message or it's a stupid and immoral message conflating modern-day non-violent conservatives and nationalists with National Socialist fanatic mass murderers. _The Great Dictator_ was a tremendous moral stand, _The Producers_ was a brave successful approach of a taboo subject, this is just satirizing the easiest possible target, one that is historical and no longer extant in any meaningful, influential sense.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy making fun of Nazis and pointing out their tremendous evil, but with the current political climate I'm expecting this movie will at least be promoted as relevant to contemporary politics, which is to say it will portray center-right politicians like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson as somehow modern-day Nazis. Obviously not relevant since they're not starting wars, mass murdering millions of people, launching genocidal campaigns, are not totalitarians or authoritarians, are opposed to socialism, and are in charge of liberal democracies with fair and free elections and rule of law.

That said, with politics aside, I like Taika Waititi and the cinematography is very pretty to look at (nice and colorful with no obvious horrible color grading), so I'll probably enjoy this film as I did _Hunt for the Wilderpeople._ I don't mind Waikiki casting himself in whiteface as Adolf Hitler. He'll almost certainly be good in the role. Looks like fun. If I was a comedian, I'd relish playing a Nazi in a movie like this."
tL4McUzXfFI,😂😂😂😂😂😂 i must watch this....
tL4McUzXfFI,“Moonrise Kingdom: the Third Reich”
tL4McUzXfFI,"A family friendly nazi movie!

tL4McUzXfFI,If stroheim isn’t in this movie we riot.
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is so fucked up. Making nazis seem like they werent evil is a disgrace to all the troops who died fighting nazis.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Since this happened I bet there will be a comedy about 9/11,I’d watch it"
tL4McUzXfFI,OMFG!! I need this!
tL4McUzXfFI,Lmao
tL4McUzXfFI,Kid dropping the panzerschreck was hilarious
tL4McUzXfFI,"There’s a special place in hell for the executives who approved this.

Also what about other atrocities that happened world wide during British rule? Boer concentration camps, what about the claims that Irish Famine was a genocide? What about Amritsar massacre? Bengal famine?"
tL4McUzXfFI,German technology is the greatest

tL4McUzXfFI,"""Oh my God!"""
tL4McUzXfFI,We need more movies that make fun of Nazis. Nazism needs the illusion of strength to thrive. Satire tears down that illusion of strength. Satire points out the absurdity of it all. That is why The Producers works
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that a jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Seems great.
tL4McUzXfFI,So a kids film has the balls to show the swastika but battlefield V doesn’t ok I’m done with EA and battlefield officially.

tL4McUzXfFI,So why is Hollywood trying to humanize Nazis I get war movies but this seems to be going a bit far
tL4McUzXfFI,I have the most fucked up sense of humor so this movie feels like it was made for me.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I never knew I wanted to listen to ""I'm a believer""  and ""under presser""? in German"
tL4McUzXfFI,So there is a jojo in the nazi era other than Joseph
tL4McUzXfFI,"Woman in the army, makes sense"
tL4McUzXfFI,banned in germany
tL4McUzXfFI,Give your entire stock
tL4McUzXfFI,All my pointless ww2 facts will come in handy
tL4McUzXfFI,People are going to be so disappointed there aren't any Nazi cyborgs or half naked Aztec vampire Male strippers in this. You expect this with JoJo in the title.
tL4McUzXfFI,"""They're using comedy to normalize Nazism!!!"" - stupid people, probably"
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally my type of movie
tL4McUzXfFI,In an alternate universe where Stroheim had a son and named him after the savior of the world.
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare Yare....
tL4McUzXfFI,Why am I not hearing Aztec dubstep?
tL4McUzXfFI,Zero Chill Taika Watiti
tL4McUzXfFI,I can picture all the republicans all lining up at the cinemas first to see this movie. Waititi is going to be a rich man
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie is channeling Wes Anderson.
tL4McUzXfFI,I love how they are making a comedy out of a horrible event.
tL4McUzXfFI,《 *ToBeContinued* N/
tL4McUzXfFI,So what's his stand
tL4McUzXfFI,"This wack.

tL4McUzXfFI,I have never wanted to see something so badly than this.
tL4McUzXfFI,BRAAKA MONOGA!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,So JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Korg is Hitler. This means Korg helped Thanos
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks great. Taika's quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. I cant wait for we're wolves too!
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 of JoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,I've always wondered WHO and WHY clicks on dislike
tL4McUzXfFI,"「Stand User」Jojo Rabbit
「Stand Name」Springtime for Hitler"
tL4McUzXfFI,"HOLY SHITAKE, IS THAT A MOTHER FLIPPING JOJO REFERENCE!?!"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie's gonna be controversial
tL4McUzXfFI,OY VEY SHUT IT DOWN ITS LIKE ANOTHA SHOA
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a awful movie
tL4McUzXfFI,The Boys of Brazil...
tL4McUzXfFI,"You thought I was a Jew, but it was me, Dio!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"A family friendly movie about Nazis?

Thanos: *IMPOSSIBLE*"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks like The Fault in our Stars meets Der Untergang and I'm ok with that.
tL4McUzXfFI,"All Jojo memes aside, this actually looks like a really good movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,When I was 10 I couldn't decide whether to choose Law or Paul in Tekken 3
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Nothing makes sense anymore""
- Nazis when they realize Jews are just people"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why can’t you hire someone else other than scarlet johnasson. There is alot of white actresses.
tL4McUzXfFI,disney owns this film XD
tL4McUzXfFI,Jah moment
tL4McUzXfFI,"History channels get taken off YouTube for talking about the holocaust, youtubers get demonetized for even mentioning nazis, and count dankula gets arrested and fined for making a joke about nazis but this gets a pass eh? I thought context didn’t matter? Basically certain people get permission? Ok 👌 just checking."
tL4McUzXfFI,Who’s up to see it day one in cosplay? Seriously. The whole premiere of this movie. Everyone. Hitler. Cosplay.
tL4McUzXfFI,BRAKA MONOGA
tL4McUzXfFI,This is fucking amazing lmao.
tL4McUzXfFI,NOOOOO GOD NOOOOOO
tL4McUzXfFI,BRRRRRAKA-MONOGA!
tL4McUzXfFI,LOL
tL4McUzXfFI,"The purpose of a joke is to create tolerance.. The corporations are trying to create a new tolerance for the Holocaust.

The CIA Capitalist Elite are trying to create a new tolerance for the Holocaust in preparation for Donald Trump's second term where he will eliminate the homeless population through genocides to hide the fact that the economy is collapsing."
tL4McUzXfFI,this story seems bizarre to me
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or does the boy with the glasses in the very last seen look a bit like Nick Frost???
tL4McUzXfFI,I wanna watch this really bad
tL4McUzXfFI,Could they have gotten one! actor with a german accent?..
tL4McUzXfFI,Can y'all actually shut up about JoJo
tL4McUzXfFI,Was...was that a JoJo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, they made Nazism into a comedy? Wtf 😂💀. Are they going to show concentration camps too?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Well... this one will definitely ruffle some feathers... time to break out the popcorn!
tL4McUzXfFI,Has a very Wes Anderson vibe
tL4McUzXfFI,やれやれだぜ。。。
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid with glasses is like Mini Me Nick Frost!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait, so Hitler is JoJos stand? Cause no one can see his stand 🤔"
tL4McUzXfFI,"thought this'd be about jojo siwa, not gonna lie lol. was gona shit myself."
tL4McUzXfFI,The only thing named Jojo I can actually tolerate
tL4McUzXfFI,This i fuckedup buti love it
tL4McUzXfFI,Awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,The origin story of Doofensmirtz
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Definitely not a good time to be a Nazi""
Is what Stroheim or his friend thought"
tL4McUzXfFI,What's his STANDO?!
tL4McUzXfFI,"So hitler in this film is a imaginary friend? That the boy summons? And the main boy's name is JoJo?

Hoo boi what an bizarre adventure awaits us"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is okay, but pewdiepie's joke wasn't okay even until now. Shame."
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope Von Stroheim is in this movie!
tL4McUzXfFI,"You utter fools!

Do you know what you've done? Do you know who's coming? !"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks like it's going to be one *BIZARRE ADVENTURE*






😂😂😂 I would show myself out"
tL4McUzXfFI,Joseph Joestar's lost son
tL4McUzXfFI,JOJO did nazis and now nazis do JOJO
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks great!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Seriously, I’m oddly charmed and viscerally disturbed at the same time."
tL4McUzXfFI,"It reminds me of Moonrise Kingdom and the Hulu show, Moone Boy, except the boy's imaginary friend is Hitler."
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder how they will approach the controversial topic of German technology because as we all know GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE GREATEST IN ZE WORLD!!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,RAKAMONOGAAA
tL4McUzXfFI,J 0 J 0
tL4McUzXfFI,A.... Wholesome Nazi movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks promising
tL4McUzXfFI,Of course liberal Hollywood makes this
tL4McUzXfFI,Of course they had to make it about jews
tL4McUzXfFI,"White Nationalism is on the rise (actually all kinds of Neo-nationalism throughout the world right now). 
Let's make a movie from a softer point of view... 
""There are good people on both sides....""   -  gradually desensitized to the horrors.  
(Are these beloved characters going to be ripped out, and shot in the street in gut-wrenching horror?
or is it a feel-good movie where everything works out in the end?)"
tL4McUzXfFI,Brrraka monoga
tL4McUzXfFI,Von Stroheim's young life
tL4McUzXfFI,"the usage of ""helden"" moved me until that part of the building blowing up by accident which made me laugh."

tL4McUzXfFI,"So Nazis are funny again? 😬 

Just kidding. I’m certain someone w/no sense of humor will be offended by this."
tL4McUzXfFI,I have a nagging suspicion that whilst watching this motion picture I will cry from both laughter and severe heart crushing sadness.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wadda fun this movie will be lololololol
tL4McUzXfFI,How long until some soy boy beta cuck starts complaining about the movie and crying about how offended they are.
tL4McUzXfFI,-.-
tL4McUzXfFI,Whats worse than being a Natzi at the time. A Natzi Vampire. Lol. Go watch 'What we do In the shadows' If you haven't already.
tL4McUzXfFI,See sjw.... see what you've done.  Nazi's are cool now.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ignoring the ""haha guys jojo LOL!!!"" this looks like a super offensive movie that isnt offensive but funny movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is strange, I don't know what to think."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I get Mel Brooks, Blazing Saddles type vibes from this, but with more of an actual story lmao"
tL4McUzXfFI,Leftist Nazis.  Art really does imitate life.
tL4McUzXfFI,Black widow wtf
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm completely lost. Can something explain what JoJo is and why it's summoning JoJo fans?
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks hilarious!
tL4McUzXfFI,"I just finished the book. Honestly, the movie looks better."
tL4McUzXfFI,this is why i learned german
tL4McUzXfFI,"Also you done fucked up now, the jojo’s community has arrived and they are bringing superior German engineering with them"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I was waiting for vasovitch to appear and start killing some nazis...
(Wolfinstein)"

tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if Jojo plays mein kraft.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Movie has JoJo in the title...

tL4McUzXfFI,BRAKA MONOGA!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,So did Jews produce this movie again
tL4McUzXfFI,"Gotta admit, I did not expect some German David Bowie blasting over a goofy Hitler"
tL4McUzXfFI,that wink to Chaplin at 1:37
tL4McUzXfFI,besides the nazis that camp would be fuckin awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler STANDO
tL4McUzXfFI,I can already smell the controversy and backlash
tL4McUzXfFI,Like Good Boys if they were all fascists

tL4McUzXfFI,Very Moonrise Kingdom
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh great, they used Heroes by David Bowie and now I have the feels from Regular Show finale."
tL4McUzXfFI,Kind of reminds me of swiss army man
tL4McUzXfFI,I expected Jojo comments and am not disappointed.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JOJO reference? 😳😳😳
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo fans when their autism acts up and starts yelling shitty jojo jokes
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Burn down the house and blame it on Winston Churchill""
Well then"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Y'all of Taika sees all of our jojo comments he could watch it and make a live action version, and honestly he would be the perfect director for it."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Authentic German accents, where have you been for the past few years?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Lol the weirdest thing about this movie is that it is literally already banned in germany. It is a parody and satire of the entire nazi way of thinking and indoctrination, probably super pro-western, and the germans will ban it because it has swastikas and SS lightning bolts and hitlers face. They lump in anti-nazi movies alongside nazi movies. This seems like a great way to forget history and then repeat it."
tL4McUzXfFI,*SEKAI ICHI*
tL4McUzXfFI,Bwahahahahaha.  Democrats have been crying like little bitches that Republicans are literally Hitler.   Hitler seems ok in this movie.  Lmfao.
tL4McUzXfFI,Designed to create a new tolerance for the Nazis.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is what we’ve come to. This is it. The event that killed 60 million people worldwide, The man who’s killing of “undesirables” is now a comedy figure. If there was a, god he’s abandoned us now."
tL4McUzXfFI,So that little boys stand is Adolf Hitler?

tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't expect the third Reich to show up
tL4McUzXfFI,I’d love to see this but I’ll be the cancel culture  will prevent this from being released.
tL4McUzXfFI,All I can say is that Fegelein better be in this movie or I'm not watching it
tL4McUzXfFI,The Jojo fandom: IS THAT A  FREAKING JOJO REFERENCE
tL4McUzXfFI,Damn I didn't know Anne Frank didn't die
tL4McUzXfFI,"Honestly Hollywood is intent on completely destroying real history... this subject matter has no room to be humorous. Far to many people died over this part of our real history.
Apparently NOTHING is without it’s opportunity to be made a joke of."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a Jojo reference?!
tL4McUzXfFI,"10% of comments : movie

tL4McUzXfFI,Hopefully it’s still got that cheerful charm like wilderpeople had.  I’m always worried they’ll push too much in because of )money( but taika did really good even when they put a ton of nonsense in like Thor
tL4McUzXfFI,SHHIIIIIIIIZZZZAAAAAAA!

tL4McUzXfFI,I can’t wait for this👍
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi shrek music. Cool
tL4McUzXfFI,I like trailer. I want to see the movie. But I don't like the public comments that the director made about marvel fans
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is dark humor at it’s finest...a lot of people won’t see it bc of the subject matter and it’s been bleak this year and we all need a good laugh. And who better to laugh about than Nazis. This will be a cult classic, for sure"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks interesting but I’m confused a little bit

tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t know what’s going one
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m gonna watch this so hard

And secondly why are we trying to make Hitler seem like a sane happy go lucky man.
Hitler is and was one of the most Evil men to ever lived. Why are we accepting a romcom about a Nazi and his Father.
If you the reader is reading this don't buy or rent a movie if you think Hitler was a Evil man. Please don't support this flim it's disgusting."

tL4McUzXfFI,Is this movie based off of something? Characters or...?
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this movie going to take it’s self seriously or no?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is going to be the best movie of the year, I love Taika so much, this could be his best one yet!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, another nazi film. Yawn."
tL4McUzXfFI,Mmm this actually looks really good

tL4McUzXfFI,I just entered expecting a Jojo reference :/
tL4McUzXfFI,"Looking like dumb liberal bias is going to ruin this movie. Why do they always have to be politically correct whenever  a jew pops up on scene...christ. The very idea that a movie that's a comedy can't have him sellout the jewish girl .....is pretty much a movie where you forcibly are read the entire plot before even watching it. I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS MOVIE, WHY DO I HAVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler had brown eyes not blue
tL4McUzXfFI,I love this...
tL4McUzXfFI,CAN THIS PLEASE COME OUT NOW OKAY THANKS.
tL4McUzXfFI,Adolf is that you?

tL4McUzXfFI,".....We have a British Jojo, A Japanese Jojo, a Italian( part japenese Jojo ) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnd now a German Jojo, what's this kid's stand?"
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't remember this in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Where are my JoJo fans at?
tL4McUzXfFI,Thomasin McKenzie :)
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yay, The Butcher Boy: German Edition, but seriously though, this movie looks so freaking good, the tone, the setting and even messages it showcases, I'm really looking forward to it, and you're all saying Taika Waititi will tank Thor 4, bullshit"
tL4McUzXfFI,Maybe the real riech was the friends we made along the way
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMAIN SCIENCE IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,Man part 9 looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,I don't know what I just whatced but 10/10 film already. Fuck Romeo and Juliet.
tL4McUzXfFI,This made so sad. I still don’t understand how the world the let this happen.
tL4McUzXfFI,"JoJo's bizarre adventure : battle tendency 2 
Also since he is known as ""rabbit"" he also knows the secret Joestar technique"
tL4McUzXfFI,"""you are not a nazi, you are a ten year old kid who likes dressing up and wants to be part of a club."" I suppose that's why nazis are back. We stopped offering boys a way to be part of a club just for them."
tL4McUzXfFI,*THIS IS AMERICA*
tL4McUzXfFI,So is half the film gonna be that they're distracted by Aztec Gods Of Fitness and need to send their cyborgs at them?
tL4McUzXfFI,🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
tL4McUzXfFI,Disney Buys Fox then makes a Hitler movie....
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf did i just watch?!
tL4McUzXfFI,Can I do a movie about Pol Pot or even Stalin as a spoof with 60s music?
tL4McUzXfFI,This kid looks like he gets drafted in the volksturm so I'm pretty sure this is gonna end really dark
tL4McUzXfFI,"Okay, I have absolutely no idea who or what Jojo is and what the hell this film is about... weird trailer, weird looking film. Looks good though."
tL4McUzXfFI,"That Twilight reference

""You know what I am? Say it""

""A Jew"" 

LOL"
tL4McUzXfFI,I fucking love all the JoJo refrences in the comments
tL4McUzXfFI,I swear if that girl die at the end ... I don’t know what I’m gonna do just don’t
tL4McUzXfFI,"I knew this movie was going to be good, but this is fantastic. A great parody of history."
tL4McUzXfFI,This should have been the first trailer. This one makes the movie look a lot more appealing to general audiences.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo’s part 6 looking good
tL4McUzXfFI,this is joseph and stroheim’s son
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait where's Joseph.
tL4McUzXfFI,Movie where hitler become a stand
tL4McUzXfFI,Was this movie targeted to jojo fans?
tL4McUzXfFI,I mean..... I’m down 🤷‍♂️😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"Anyone getting kind of bored of nazis on film, in games, in documentaries and everything else. It's like the world began in 1933"
tL4McUzXfFI,omg
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait, thats not a jojo reference"
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo’s Bizarres Abenteuer

tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a fucking jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks so good!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, a comedic WW2 movie. Haven't seen a good one since Inglorious Bastards!"

tL4McUzXfFI,Is this the story of Stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,MENACING.
tL4McUzXfFI,Soooooo..... I'm guessing I won't see it in Israel?
tL4McUzXfFI,Seems like jojo is going to go on a really bizarre adventure in this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Is the kid also gay or the name with the anime is just a coincidence?
tL4McUzXfFI,Lol
tL4McUzXfFI,What is the song from the second half of the trailer it’s great if anyone knows it would be appreciated
tL4McUzXfFI,The JoJo reboot looking weird
tL4McUzXfFI,This reminded the book All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo part 6 looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,What the Hell?
tL4McUzXfFI,SEKAI ICHIIIII
tL4McUzXfFI,This is Le Epic Gamer Meme Movie!! xD 🤣🤣😅😂
tL4McUzXfFI,does something like this really need to be made based on a horrible period of our history.  nothing funny about this art nonsense.
tL4McUzXfFI,this HAS to be a JOJO REFERENCE
tL4McUzXfFI,Man SJWs are gonna have a tough time
tL4McUzXfFI,"0:48

Straight from the devil's mouth.

You look the same because those fake Jews are just converts. Jew is not an ethnicity. Just pale skin people who follow a religion."
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m extremely offended and triggered right now! I will boycott this movie! 😡
tL4McUzXfFI,wow
tL4McUzXfFI,""" *_Nazis the movie_* ""
Plus how we get black Widow 2 the movie trailer before Black Widow the movie get released"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this movie or series?
tL4McUzXfFI,Aaaaand here we go 😒
tL4McUzXfFI,"holy shit, this looks amazing"
tL4McUzXfFI,This kid stando is Hitler?!
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s like if Wes Anderson tried to make “Come and see”
tL4McUzXfFI,*NANI*
tL4McUzXfFI,Jesus christ JJBA fans are the WORST
tL4McUzXfFI,Because everything has to be about nazis
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojos Nazi adventures
tL4McUzXfFI,Real Jews don’t look like that
tL4McUzXfFI,"Why is this funny?
Why do people think Hitler is funny? Like didnt he kill millions of people"
tL4McUzXfFI,Lol how did this movie get made?
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim’s origin story is pretty wild
tL4McUzXfFI,hitler is on his mind or it's actually his friend?
tL4McUzXfFI,1:00 was that a Twilight reference or am I crazy?
tL4McUzXfFI,"To the people who are making jojokes here, you guys are super original and funny, like honestly you guys are not annoying at all"
tL4McUzXfFI,I think I'm gonna enjoy this one!
tL4McUzXfFI,"What in the world is this?

And when can I see it"
tL4McUzXfFI,You bet your sweet nazi ass I'm watching this
tL4McUzXfFI,"If this shows Jewish camps I’d be scarred, because I’m Jewish myself and I’ve stopped myself from watching nazi movies."
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika is the master at finding young kids for his movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Good bye jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,"I am guessing this is supposed to make fun of people who are pro American, or pro nationalist in any country?   It looks funny and seems good humored.  If it ends up being a political statement.. I would say they can shove it up their ass.   Keeping illegal immigrants out is not the same thing as rounding up Jews and exterminating them.  It would be like if Jews were sneaking into germany during WWII and then complaining when they got deported.   But, they like to call Trump and his supporters Nazi's and fascists.  Though, none of that is true.  If I had to guess.. That is what I think this is going to be about."
tL4McUzXfFI,Dio’s grandson is gonna grow up to be a fine Nazi stand user
tL4McUzXfFI,Uhhhhhhh.....................?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hmm. Not quite Good Boys, but I'll see it."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this Part 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,THAT KID LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE NICK FROST LOL
tL4McUzXfFI,"Because it's From Talka woke titties, probably won't be a very good movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,And the award for best movie goes to Jojo rabbit can’t wait for this 😊
tL4McUzXfFI,This is amazing and just the movie that I need
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this even appropriate?
tL4McUzXfFI,I dont mind movies like this and Inglorious Basterds. I just hate that it becomes the narrative people end up believing about what happened in WWII.
tL4McUzXfFI,SONO CHI NO SADAME!!! JOOOOOJO!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,What strange song choices 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Just give this kid an arrow he'll be fine
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought this was a Jojo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,I can't wait too see this
tL4McUzXfFI,Garbage.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ive only got two questions...

1. Is Hitler his stand?
2.Does it take part during part 2?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Another degenerate Shittywood movie bashing Hitler. What else is new? They cant think of anything else in thier uncreative simplistic pea brains to make...so why not another turd film of (drum roll) BASHING Hitler! Yay us! We are cool and creative!
tL4McUzXfFI,I hate this trend of youngifying actors. Nick Frost looks ridiculous!
tL4McUzXfFI,Wonder how the alt-right are gonna react to this movie when it comes out
tL4McUzXfFI,I find this film incredibly offensive and unnecessary.
tL4McUzXfFI,Speeedwagooooooon
tL4McUzXfFI,I only watched it because of JOJO
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie looks fantastic
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nazis, holocausts, etc.   over saturated and banal.  I watch movies for escapism.  I don't watch movies to be magically whisked away to Twitter or reddit."
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm super confused
tL4McUzXfFI,tfw jojo's stand is adolf hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,idk looks boring af

tL4McUzXfFI,Das freaken Goggleeye
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo fans learn basic human decency and how to respect films challenge.
tL4McUzXfFI,Can someone exsplain what i just watched?
tL4McUzXfFI,"On one hand this looks genuinely hilarious but on the other, this is Nazi Germany we're talking about and it hasn't even been a full century."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so Lubitsch!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ok....
Now films with nazi is ok.
Fuck my life.
The end is near man...i told ya '--'"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks hilarious! Can't wait to see it.

tL4McUzXfFI,This is........uhhhhhhhhhhhhh.........a thing?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hey look, a movie about 4chan"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I am curious, I wanna watch this."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I wonder if the UK will try to ban this for being “grossly offensive”.
10 points if you get the reference."
tL4McUzXfFI,Fail.
tL4McUzXfFI,Sooo Hitler is his stand?? Man these keep getting real Bizarre..
tL4McUzXfFI,"Das ist sowas von akkurat, großartig!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Jo~~~~ jo!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"If you squint really hard, this is Danger 5 the movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,They made Stone Ocean live action
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler seems like a really odd stand
tL4McUzXfFI,This shit ain't funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,"So... not allowed Nazis in wolfenstein or other games...

But this? This is where it's fine? 

I don't understand-"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I am german and i have to say, that this is the most stupid movie I have ever seen. This is why Americans think, it's cool to wear a nazi uniform and call ss troops 'heroes'. In Germany no one would even dare to play down our history like that, you can even get to jail for doing this."
tL4McUzXfFI,Ummm nope
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheim's Bizarre Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,2:04 that'd be a good time to use the secret technique Jojo..

tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks really good. 10/10 will see in theaters ☺️

tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie's a satire of WWII, yet it looks more like WWII than Battlefield V does."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ngl, this is pretty disgusting.This film could easily be accused of ""Normalizing"" Nazis. Not something we need right now in the fascist USA"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Demonetisation, nazi propaganda reeeee"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so cool!! Would love to see this!
tL4McUzXfFI,\o
tL4McUzXfFI,Was that a jojo reference?

tL4McUzXfFI,wtf is this?
tL4McUzXfFI,"""You're not a nazi, you're a kid who likes dressing up in a costume and wants to be part of a club"". Way more members of the alt-right and MRA's need to hear this."

tL4McUzXfFI,"Hey maybe making naziism look fun is a shitty idea, especially with white nationalism and race-based terrorism on the rise in America. This movie is a horrible idea, and just the trailer could have been the deciding factor into someone's delve into fascism and alt-right terrorism."
tL4McUzXfFI,I can see the Joseph Joestar resemblance in this kid.
tL4McUzXfFI,"""You're not a Nazi Jojo. You're a stand user."""

tL4McUzXfFI,It's not funny sorry..to much opsesssions with nazis come up with something original. It got really boring 30 years ago.
tL4McUzXfFI,OMG......
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m so tired of JoJo memes ima be honest
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is gonna start some controversy 
And if I’m being honest I hope the directors keep making the movie how it’s presented here"
tL4McUzXfFI,Whoever came up with this concept was crazy BUT definitely smart
tL4McUzXfFI,The world nazi must be trending time to make money off it.
tL4McUzXfFI,Whoever decided to make light of nazi Germany is an idiot. Anyone who thinks that anything about nazi Germany was funny is also an  idiot
tL4McUzXfFI,Already in love with this❤️
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to gas JoJo fans
tL4McUzXfFI,Another Taika comedy that's gonna slap us in the face and kick us in the feels...can't wait!
tL4McUzXfFI,WHAT IS THIS RECOMMENDED LMAOOOOO
tL4McUzXfFI,Tbh definitely not a good time to be a nazi 🤪
tL4McUzXfFI,Sorry if I offend anyone but this looks like one of the funniest movies in years!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"man jojos bizarre adventure part 9 looks lit 

i wonder if we will see joseph or the piller men"
tL4McUzXfFI,What is up with this guy!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Scarlet‘s and Sam’s accent: not German at all..?! I don‘t even understand them sometimes. Scarlet‘s „t“s are way too hard and Sam, I don‘t know what he does.
Stephen Merchant: mh still sounds very english, at least he is not butchering anything
Rebel: awesome! Really! Simple and very accurate.
Taika: fine. His „was?“ is perfect, the rest he kinda sounds like a German that speaks pretty well rounded English. His German accent in What we do in the shadows was perfect though and he even spoke awesome German in it, so I am pretty confident he will do a good job here too.
Sincerely, your friendly neighbourhood Kraut
(apart from some accents, nothing is accurate, but well it doesn‘t have to)"
tL4McUzXfFI,BRRRRRRRAKA MONOGA!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hollywood: ""Alright, Taika. You made Thor: Ragnarok and it was amazing! For your next movie, what do you want to do?""

TW: ""I want to make a Nazi movie where I play Hitler.""

Hollywood: ...

TW: ...

Hollywood: ...

TW: ...

Hollywood: Sold"
tL4McUzXfFI,Idk if a rom com is the best genre to make a movie about nazi Germany in but go off scarlet
tL4McUzXfFI,I both intrigued and kind of terrified. This could end up being a great comedy with heartful moments or a complete clusterfuck that disrepects the memory of the holocaust.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Is nobody going to mention the fact that ""I'm a Believer"" and ""We Can be Heroes"" are in this trailer in German?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This was going very good until it became a fucking childhood love story
tL4McUzXfFI,WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
tL4McUzXfFI,Mmm new chapter JoJo bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,Was that a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Уже так гитлера пиарите? Мракобесы
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi-rise kingdom?
tL4McUzXfFI,This trailer caught me woefully off guard.
tL4McUzXfFI,I really have no idea what I've just watched...
tL4McUzXfFI,"U thaugh its Duo, but its I, HITLEEER"
tL4McUzXfFI,Not interested.
tL4McUzXfFI,"""You're a 10 year old who likes to dress up and be in a club.""

They shouldn't name  the movie that way XD"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks great!
tL4McUzXfFI,Can make fun of germans : totally fine. make fun of Jews: anti semitic.
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like its going to be a bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand Name:「 Adolf Hitler 」

Stand Ability: 「 To Be or Not to Be 」"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does this already feel like a Wes Anderson film I'm going to skip entirely?
tL4McUzXfFI,If Moonrise Kingdom and Inglorious Bastards had a baby...
tL4McUzXfFI,Imagine getting molested by scarlett Johansson why would you even complain
tL4McUzXfFI,Will we get to see a young Stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,is that a *JoJo* reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Thought it was a jojo real life action film or something lol
tL4McUzXfFI,This is an abomination. A genocide of millions of human beings in one of the world's darkest times shouldn't be made light of. How absolutely tawdry and inappropriate.
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is awesome 😂 
Now make another one about the Japanese imperial army and their subjugation of China and Korea."
tL4McUzXfFI,Solely clicked on this because I was expecting JJBA comments and I was not disappointed.
tL4McUzXfFI,Stroheneim origin story looks fabulous
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the safest movie ever made... making fun of nazis ... never seen that before...
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oi, Josuke! We seem to be nazis."
tL4McUzXfFI,One of them is gonna die guaranteed
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a movie or show
tL4McUzXfFI,I heard they got 13 year olds pregnant/ laid
tL4McUzXfFI,What a fucking surprise. Hollyweird puts out YET another Nazi movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,"SONO CHI NO SADAME!
JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOJO!"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks incredible!
tL4McUzXfFI,So let me get this straight this little kids name is Jojo and his stand is Adolf Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks so good!!! I really wanna see it :D
tL4McUzXfFI,"""well...""






(that was a jojos reference)"
tL4McUzXfFI,1:23 Battlefield V reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Gee part 9 looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,Comedy and Nazis/Holocaust seem like words that would never make sense together ... then this trailer came out
tL4McUzXfFI,BAKAMONO GA DOITSU NO KAGAKU WA SEKAI ICHI
tL4McUzXfFI,You people raise me to hate Hitler and love little rascals what the duck do I feel about this!?!?!
tL4McUzXfFI,"They left out ""What we do in the Shadows"" from Waititi. One of the best comedies out there and probably the movie that put him on the map."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow. I'm . . really not sure how I feel about this.
tL4McUzXfFI,Fucking JoJo fans
tL4McUzXfFI,I refuse to belive this exists
tL4McUzXfFI,Lol
tL4McUzXfFI,Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant in a satirical Nazi Germany? Don't mind if I do
tL4McUzXfFI,BABY NAZIS
tL4McUzXfFI,Excited for the alt right reaction to this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JOJO reference
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hold on, a kid with an invisible figure that only he can see and his name is Jojo? That could only mean...

Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: 1939. With his stand ""Mein Kampf"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Writer director Taika Waititi. This will be a classic 😎🤩
tL4McUzXfFI,"I had NO idea there would be anime jokes in this section,and I like it!!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn’t expect the Third Reich to show up.
tL4McUzXfFI,"sono chino sadame...
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIITLER!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Rudol von Stroheim better be in this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,so hitler is a german boy's  stand...interesting
tL4McUzXfFI,Awww how cute another Jew sponsored movie against the ideals of Adolf Hilter. Seriously how many more WW2 movies the Jews need to make so we can sympathize with them? 🤣 Fucking Jews cant even say that in public without been arrested.
tL4McUzXfFI,Prequel to JOJO BA I see🧐
tL4McUzXfFI,I came here to make a joke about JoJo’s Bizarre adventure and left genuinely excited for this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,LOL
tL4McUzXfFI,This is absolutely DISGUSTING. Humanizing Nazis. And making a joke of GENOCIDE...... You evil people.... And queen Victoria married her first cousin Albert. They had inbred children..... These glorifies hillbillies caused the world wars...... THERE IS NOTHING FUN OR CUTE ABOUT IT
tL4McUzXfFI,"Meanwhile, His father Strolheim is battling the Pillar Men with Joseph..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I need to see this with some germans
tL4McUzXfFI,"This is so weird. Looks like a Wes Anderson movie on acid, lol. Gotta see this. Taika Waititi rules!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Not at all what I expected. Loving it.
tL4McUzXfFI,Interesting
tL4McUzXfFI,*BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAKAAAAAA MONOGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA* !!!!!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Lol joos
tL4McUzXfFI,I'd imagine Wes Anderson to direct this kind of movies
tL4McUzXfFI,Has similar personality like the death of Stalin. I'm gonna be excited to watch it
tL4McUzXfFI,And of course the director/writer is jewish.
tL4McUzXfFI,Didn't know they were doing a live action remake of JoJo Part 2.
tL4McUzXfFI,"It has a essence of moonrise Kingdom and hunt for wilderness ,looks really good"
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika Waititi is the next Wes Anderson
tL4McUzXfFI,I wanna see this!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yare yare daze, I never thought we'd see them pull out the Hitler stand"
tL4McUzXfFI,w8 it isnt a jojo. .......
tL4McUzXfFI,"probably the only movie trailer I've seen this year that makes me think ""I'm gonna watch the shit out of this"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks fun given that their making a comedy out of what kids were put through but eh could be funny
tL4McUzXfFI,The fat kid looks like a tiny Nick Frost (the fat guy from Shaun of the Dead)
tL4McUzXfFI,So Taika Waititi makes Wes Anderson movies now?
tL4McUzXfFI,_This film truly a Golden experience_
tL4McUzXfFI,Trivialising WW2 .. sad. There is nothing funny about mass murder.
tL4McUzXfFI,Nice to see scarlett isnt doing yellowface for a change
tL4McUzXfFI,Wes Anderson?
tL4McUzXfFI,"It’s based on a book, and Bowie makes everything better!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Trash
tL4McUzXfFI,"Meme culture is what we get for saying ""Are you horny, baby?"" in the 90's. We deserve all the gut-wrenching cringe we see and read."

tL4McUzXfFI,"""Must confront his blind nationalism"" 
Wow, movies are really cool now huh..."
tL4McUzXfFI,<3
tL4McUzXfFI,"What an unfortunate name to give a movie in 2019.
It would be different if the Jos weren't capitalized but as is the movie might as well be named Naruto Rabbit."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Nice...so, how long until the SJW cry about this one and is never gets released because “Boo-hoo!  The Natzis on the screen hurt my feel-feels!” Ah?

Hope it makes release, looks like a silly fun comedy."
tL4McUzXfFI,wtf
tL4McUzXfFI,The casting in this movie is so on point lmao
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie will be a hit in Germany!
tL4McUzXfFI,Moral of the fable: Pretty girls can overcome all your previous believes just with their persuasion.  Which is true.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hope they use ""get back"" in the sountrack"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Boy, this sure is a weird looking Spy Kids prequel."
tL4McUzXfFI,The girl in the closet in Anna frank right?
tL4McUzXfFI,What is up with these movies trying to humanize nazis????????
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't know how I feel about this film as it is not an accurate representation of WWII. WWII should not humored or made humorous like this movie. WWII was not fun and games, it was hell and I believe this is very disrespectful to the people who died there. This is the only thing I'll stand by like a Democrat standing behind gun control but my reason makes sense."
tL4McUzXfFI,So this movie is going to be about a nazi summer camp lol
tL4McUzXfFI,ohh wow
tL4McUzXfFI,The de-aging tech they used for nick frost is incredible!
tL4McUzXfFI,Damn and I thought The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas was a better movie...
tL4McUzXfFI,Alternate musics in nazi germany ?  What kind of Jojo's Wolfenstein adventure is this ?
tL4McUzXfFI,I can only imagine the amount of outrage this movie will have...oh boy

tL4McUzXfFI,Romanoff reborn in german?? Thank God! You brought her again in this world
tL4McUzXfFI,It's definitely not a good time to be a nazi lmao
tL4McUzXfFI,"Loved hearing Bowies's ""Heroes/Helden"" on this."
tL4McUzXfFI,2:01 THAT'S NOT A GOOD TIME TO BE A NAZY... WHEN U HAVE A BRITISH ACCENT AND HOLD A MISSILE LAUNCHER. WAHAHHAAHAHAHAH BETTER THAN MARVEL ENDGAME.
tL4McUzXfFI,*Leaked Part 9 Fottage with Stroheims Son*
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m curious what the thoughts are of the people disliking this video..
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks fucking awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,DIOOOOOO
tL4McUzXfFI,"Can we get an accurate movie of Nazi Germany from the German perspective. This film is satirical propaganda, again against white people."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Me: What did I just watch!? 
Me again: I WANT TO SEE MORE!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie is gonna spawn so many new memes, I can feel it."
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie: *exists*

Jojo fans: Allow us to introduce ourselves..."
tL4McUzXfFI,Hiel Mickey! This will be a good movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo part 9
tL4McUzXfFI,Nazi Camp Day Care!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,I came here expecting a mix of Watership Down and Stardust Crusaders
tL4McUzXfFI,The amount of JoJo references in the comments
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Burn the house down and blame Winston Churchill"" underrated line"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like fox is finally using that Hitler speech rights they own
tL4McUzXfFI,Anybody else notice Heroes was sung in German? 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,8/10 no stand users but there’s hitler then it’s ok
tL4McUzXfFI,"I, for one, am a fan of Taika Waititi and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure so this comment section is cool with me"
tL4McUzXfFI,What's the song is the second half
tL4McUzXfFI,"Ironic, seeing as it's produced and acted by J3ws. The same one's who push for divershitty and open borders in the states, but have open concentration camps in Israel; a city surrounded by a 30ft wall to keep out people with different beliefs and ethnic origins."
tL4McUzXfFI,I’m getting so many Kung fury vibes from this.
tL4McUzXfFI,So I guess Antifa will be protesting this movie and burning down theaters because there are Nazis in it
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks to be shaping up to be another Taika Waititi classic.😁👌
tL4McUzXfFI,can’t wait for stroheim to show up
tL4McUzXfFI,789 alt-right humorless shitheads didn't like this.
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing.
tL4McUzXfFI,SJW community didnt get involve yet?
tL4McUzXfFI,OI JOSUKE! i saw your dad in this movie next to some nazi saying something about german science! aint that zany?
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks great.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Christ, this fat kid is a walking catastrophe. When he's not bombing shops he's lodging knives into other kids, sheesh!"
tL4McUzXfFI,disgusting....
tL4McUzXfFI,the awkward moment when you realize half the people in the comments didn't realize the name Jojo existed until they saw a cartoon made in Japan.
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh cool we are getting a Stroheim movie
tL4McUzXfFI,wait a second... this isn't a Jojo reference at all!!
tL4McUzXfFI,this is gonna be EPIC
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, the lighter side of being a NAZI."
tL4McUzXfFI,2:11 Is that an 8 year old Nick Frost?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Spoilers!!








JoJo several years later he became a loyal half cyborg nazi soldier, helping an american ‘friend’, to eliminate the powerful “Pillar Men”."
tL4McUzXfFI,"is this gonna be another anti-nazi , jewish propaganda?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Omg yeah this will be great for race relations - everyone is white nazi these days - Jesus
tL4McUzXfFI,"It looks hella entertaining and I will watch it in the theaters but because I am now socialized to see a gendercolored world, all I see is a movie where all the adult men are Hitler and Nazi soldiers and all women are kind-hearted antifascists."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Taika is an absolute genius.
On another note if you haven't seen What We Do in the Shadows (original film not FX show) exit out of YT this moment and watch it"
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 looks dope
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm not the only who thinks this movie is a tad more fucked up than a fucked up movie should be, am I?"
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought it was Hitler  from the TV show preacher. On the photo
tL4McUzXfFI,Oy vey...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Eventually, he stopped thinking"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Fox releases JOJO RABBIT Official Trailer
Looper , WatchMojo , IGN : *_TOP 10 Easter Eggs you've missed._*"

tL4McUzXfFI,"10% this looks like a cool movie

90%. AYAYYAYAA"

tL4McUzXfFI,Finally something lighthearted to bring the family to.
tL4McUzXfFI,a comedy with children in SS uniforms.......what the hell did i just watch
tL4McUzXfFI,I am surprised how they managed to get Scarjo for something like this. Looks like one of those really bad german comedies.
tL4McUzXfFI,"You are expecting Jojo

But it was me DIO !!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Waiting for the libtards to come and complain
tL4McUzXfFI,When Germany makes a movie to add humor to the time they actively slaughtered millions of innocents. I guess there's worse things to do. Lol.
tL4McUzXfFI,Just imagine if German people made this movie 🎦
tL4McUzXfFI,"Just like araki to throw a curve ball for season 9

tL4McUzXfFI,Why do the Nazis speak English?
tL4McUzXfFI,So basically khazar milkers over the 3rd reich ?
tL4McUzXfFI,is this part 9
tL4McUzXfFI,This is clearly a comedy making fun of nazis but the sjws are going to lose their minds over this.
tL4McUzXfFI,this is like a wes anderson movie without the symmetry
tL4McUzXfFI,SJWs are gonna have a problem with this.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I like how they mix comedy with something as serious as this, definitely gonna watch it."
tL4McUzXfFI,It looks good but....leave some stuff out the trailer ffs .....that felt like the whole movie
tL4McUzXfFI,It’s like they want me to like Hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,"BAKAMONOGA,DOITSU NO KAKAGU WA SEKAI ICHI!"

tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really good
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's like Taika Watiti saw Jojo and was like, ""you know what would be even better? Having hitler as a stand"". I'm glad this got recommended to me because Jojo. Otherwise i probably would have completely missed it in theatres"

tL4McUzXfFI,guys not everything has to be jojo related
tL4McUzXfFI,"Came here because of Jojo's bizarre adventure, stayed cuz movie actually has interesting premise."
tL4McUzXfFI,I wanted to make a jojo reference but jesus fuck this already seems like a bad movie and not because of the whole nazi thing but because they dont have stroheim
tL4McUzXfFI,"Please put ""speedWAGONNN!"" scene in the movie"

Что за хуйню вы опять сняли?"
tL4McUzXfFI,BRRRRAKA MONOGA
tL4McUzXfFI,...
tL4McUzXfFI,Ok ok 👍👍😁
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJoLion > JoJoRabbit
tL4McUzXfFI,"David Bowie

that's cheating - that's just pulling at my heart strings ..."
tL4McUzXfFI,What the hell 😆 this is going to be interesting 🤔
tL4McUzXfFI,ZA WARDO!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Huh. Only watched this seven times. I ought to queue up an eighth viewing.
tL4McUzXfFI,I really enjoy all of these JoJo references here.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojos Stroheim Adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hollywood, continuing the narrative along with the media."
tL4McUzXfFI,"bold move, netflix"
tL4McUzXfFI,I expected JoJokes and i got a movie with Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,Yasss Scarlett! Get it girl 😍
tL4McUzXfFI,"One would think that this movie wouldn't do well for the fact that Nazi's are kind of an iffy subject, but it actually looks like a semi funny, semi wholesome movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's about nazis, but i feel all warm and nice inside..."
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this what the antifa youth looks like?
tL4McUzXfFI,I saw the video: hmmm... This say jojo.... *looking through the comments* yep im not the only one
tL4McUzXfFI,*German Science is the Greatest in the World!*
tL4McUzXfFI,So now they are doing jokes and a comedy about the horrible atrocities the Nazis committed? I mean I am Austrian but not offended but think of all the people that lost someone to this regime. You are also kind of making hitler look goofy and stuff when really he was a murderer and a methhead rage induced psychopathic psociopathic liar.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Please don't let this movie promote more mentally ill shooters, imma watch it though"
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do they have to inject politics into my movies? I remember when movies were just for fun.
tL4McUzXfFI,Very topical. We do need more movies to deal with blind nationalism. Especially with brexit and the US election.
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie proves that 'Hitler did nothing wrong'
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a Stroheim prequel ?Sekai ichi!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,Inglorious Youngsters
tL4McUzXfFI,How could I “Nazi” this movie?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hahaha,fox search light or torch light?..next"
tL4McUzXfFI,this must be the work of an enemy stand
tL4McUzXfFI,"Finally, a movie Republicans can relate to"
tL4McUzXfFI,OY VEY!
tL4McUzXfFI,"A bunch of Jews playing Nazis in a Hollywood film. ""How original"".
Can we please get some stories that are more... uhmm idk... THIS CENTURY?
This is all so tiresome."
tL4McUzXfFI,The manga was better
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 looks different.
tL4McUzXfFI,Well this is wow
tL4McUzXfFI,Uh oh...This will definitely piss off some SJW's....👍👍
tL4McUzXfFI,i’m a jojo fan as much as the next guy but leave the movie alone man
tL4McUzXfFI,This is lovably awful
tL4McUzXfFI,Anime was a mistake
tL4McUzXfFI,if the Jewish girl doesn't give her last Hamon before being crushed by a rock I'm out.
tL4McUzXfFI,looks like the biggest ripoff of moonlight kingdom (visually)
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the kind of movie perfect for Taika. A comedy or  a satira. NOT A COMIC MOVIE
tL4McUzXfFI,"Will this be a good movie about the dillema of an indoctrinated child that will actually be good ? Or will it be more leftist propaganda of ""men bad , wahmen opressed"" ? Hopefully it's  the former , not the later."
tL4McUzXfFI,Tiny hat rubbish
tL4McUzXfFI,The camp was where Rudol von Stroheim trained at
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or does anyone else see a little Nick Frost in the kid with the glasses
tL4McUzXfFI,Strange to see zad as a real German Nazi. Aber die Musik ist klasse.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait a minute is Hitler a STANDO of JOJOO!?
tL4McUzXfFI,I genuinely tough there was something related to Jojo Bizarre Adventures...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Trigger Alert, kids are turning into NAZI’s!!! Run into your safe space!!! All hide! Take additional pharmaceuticals!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣."
tL4McUzXfFI,1:03 this pun is not going to work in many other languages ....
tL4McUzXfFI,"Can't wait to see live action adventures of Stroheim, the Jobro we never thought we wanted, but definitely needed
GERMAN MEDICINE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD"
tL4McUzXfFI,I came here for Jojo reference comments.
tL4McUzXfFI,It's gonno be great
tL4McUzXfFI,"*""VON STROHEIM!!!!""*"
tL4McUzXfFI,So is this what happened after Battle Tendency?

tL4McUzXfFI,Remember the time an American-British divebombed a God into a volcano with the help of a Nazi?
tL4McUzXfFI,I really didn't know what to think at first but the more I watched the more I really wanted to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks funny hopefully my friends don't cancel me for going to see it
tL4McUzXfFI,GERMANY HAS THE BEST SCIENCE IN THE WOOOORLD
tL4McUzXfFI,Rip SJW’s who are about to tear their anuses all over this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,i don't know they'll be making strontheim origin story in the alternate universe as a prequel
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really good! I just hope lots of theatres show it because this is the type of film we need more people to support. Most people only go see Blockbusters and not small indie films like this
tL4McUzXfFI,idk about this ... yes they have alot of popular actors but it's about nazi's... we dont fuck with nazi's
tL4McUzXfFI,"Expected Jojo, got ANOTHER nazi movie."
tL4McUzXfFI,"this looks like garbage, I could see it going straight to vod"
tL4McUzXfFI,How to train a hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,so this is satire but in a depiction of the Hitler Youth? Also was that supposed to be Himmler & Anne Frank?
tL4McUzXfFI,All the JoJo comments... good God so happy to see my people so widespread.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Man, if you don't know anime you walk out of these comments wondering when Ozzy became the less popular lead singer of Black Sabbath..."
tL4McUzXfFI,I loved it!
tL4McUzXfFI,Moonreich Kingdom
tL4McUzXfFI,Moonrise Kingdom vibes
tL4McUzXfFI,I am so excited for this.
tL4McUzXfFI,Book burning... i think they meant waste disposal... considering  the books were all communist propaganda.
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo? Get their family name off of this 😂 Stroheim was the only German they were cool with.
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,German David Bowie is the best thing I’ve heard
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm so watching this
tL4McUzXfFI,"Its time to start a revolution a ""Nazi Revolution"""
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks ass
tL4McUzXfFI,Was? Of cause you can.. lol
tL4McUzXfFI,Yes! This looks like it's going to be quite funny.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Conquer the Sun, Hitler."
tL4McUzXfFI,1:23 Is that Stroheim with is canon ?
tL4McUzXfFI,0/10 not the real jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,When you turn Hitler jn a comedy
tL4McUzXfFI,Yoshikage Kira singing in this one.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I LOVE this , looks amazing"
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow. This actually looks Interesting and probably took lots of convincing to make. I can’t wait
tL4McUzXfFI,is this a mf jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Nice propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,KONO DIO DA!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Current year
Someone not paying attention to current events: I think we should make a movie about Hitler"
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks oddly charming...it has Stephen Merchant so I'm in.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is it just me or the kid with the round glasses really looks like a mini nick frost?
tL4McUzXfFI,How long will it take for them for them to end this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,They make a movie mocking nazis but a YouTuber has to go to court because his dog was doing  the nazi greeting and he was mockingly saying gas the jews. Fucking love this world.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Part 9 looks awesome! And not gonna lie,JoJo's stand looks alot like Hitler."
tL4McUzXfFI,Not a single  ORA ORA ORA in this trailer??? This movie title is a lie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Its 2019... you know what would be refreshing... another movie about jews in ww2... theres only 5000.
tL4McUzXfFI,and the kid grows up to be brad pitt
tL4McUzXfFI,"I want to make a jojoke but the best ones are already taken in less then 2 hours. Just scroll pas this... 
Yare yare daze..."
tL4McUzXfFI,Saw the name and the comments did not disappoint.
tL4McUzXfFI,The twist is that Jojo is the imaginary friend 😅
tL4McUzXfFI,What the fuck was fox thinking 😂😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,I smell cancel culture a mile away from this film
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie has some balls showing nazi imagary in 2019

tL4McUzXfFI,YOU UTTER FOOL
tL4McUzXfFI,Here come the sjw’s
tL4McUzXfFI,I am not confident with the depiction of my Führer and the best Reich.
tL4McUzXfFI,I love the German version of the song heroes. It's actually song by David Bowie. He loved the German language.
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare yare daze
tL4McUzXfFI,What is this cancer
tL4McUzXfFI,*za warudo*
tL4McUzXfFI,SHUT UP AND GIVE TAKE MY MONEY
tL4McUzXfFI,Thought I was coming to the comments to see discord about the trailer. Perhaps it’s messages or even some conspiracy talk about subversion. But now I’m intrigued. What is this Jojo and what’s his circus.
tL4McUzXfFI,Where’s the black representation
tL4McUzXfFI,"i like that no one taking this as a historical movie, but a JOJO’s memes everywhere"
tL4McUzXfFI,"A parody of life. Don't forget to learn the truth for yourself, nobody will do it for you. You will only end up living someone else's life and never your own."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait this isn't Jojo part six trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,1:22 wait did I just saw Rammstein .. can't wait to see this Movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo's bizarre adventure; the Nazi chapter. Starring JoJo the kid and Adiolf Hitler as the bad guy.
tL4McUzXfFI,Those trees are stealing valuable roles from Scarlett 💀
tL4McUzXfFI,Saw a trailer in the theater and knew what it was immediately and started laughing as everyone stared at me like I was crazy.
tL4McUzXfFI,I heard Disney (yeah that Disney) were skeptical of Taika Waititi directing Thor Love and Thunder because of this movie and how it would hurt its brand for being a bit “edgy”. it’s a satire for god’s sake chill lol.
tL4McUzXfFI,"uh oh... I'm going to cry a lot in this movie. Like the ugly kind, uncontrollably. All my years of bottled up emotion are going to rage out of me like niagara falls. I just know it."
tL4McUzXfFI,OH IT'S... Jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Sono chino sadame hittleeer
tL4McUzXfFI,"German versions of “I’m a Believer” and “Heroes”?

Yall:JOJO HEE HEE"
tL4McUzXfFI,I watch the trailer and I think “ I’ll give this a chance it looks funny” next I look at the comments “CONFOUND IT ALL BE THERE NO ESCAPE FROM THE JOJO REFERENCES.” Saying that this show looks good and I shall enjoy it hoping for a cameo from von stronheim
tL4McUzXfFI,"Imagine this on Disney+, it would be greate!"
tL4McUzXfFI,omg this was a wild ride
tL4McUzXfFI,"I feel like near the end of this movie, it’s going to get dark real quick

Edit: Damn, didn’t expect this comment to get liked that much. Thanks"
tL4McUzXfFI,There is nothing wrong with this movie! Waiting for it!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Little does everyone know, they weren’t burning any and all books. Just things like pornography and unfortunately Jewish texts. Just a little bit of skewed history from Hollywood"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a German version of I'm a believer
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'm gonna cry watching this, aren't I?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"My oh my, who else came here because we all thought, ""JOJO?!"""
tL4McUzXfFI,The sjw are going to hate this movie
tL4McUzXfFI,Why does this give me Calvin and Hobbes vibes
tL4McUzXfFI,WTF?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh boy!!!! Words can't express how much I look forward to seeing this! I was already stoked before the trailer but now that I see how hard they're lampooning that Nazi bastard, I'm even more excited than I was before."
tL4McUzXfFI,The Jew was hot
tL4McUzXfFI,Why is no one talking about how “I’m a Believer” from Shrek was translated into German and sounds amazing
tL4McUzXfFI,"Don't mind me, I'm just here looking for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure comments."
tL4McUzXfFI,Hopefully no-one dies in this one
tL4McUzXfFI,This will truly be a bizarre adventure 😃
tL4McUzXfFI,Literally every single Jojo’s fan that gets recommended this trailer: “GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN ZE VORLD!”
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Come forth! 「MEIN KAMPF」!

tL4McUzXfFI,"Ah, the next joestar"
tL4McUzXfFI,This movie looks like it has heart and love and brilliant characters. I’m so excited about this movie. Taika looks like he’s gonna deliver a great performance.
tL4McUzXfFI,The German version's of the songs tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,"So the movie is a comedy about nazis and hittler 



My friend is sad after he watched a Jew execute in a nazi movie where a nazi kid pretends to be a Jew"
tL4McUzXfFI,Scarlett Johanson is actually a jew
tL4McUzXfFI,you wanna know what books they burned?
tL4McUzXfFI,"23% of the comments : Omg is that Taika Waititi?


77% of the comments : SONO CHI NO SADAME"
tL4McUzXfFI,This will flop like all movies nowadays.    Hollyweird at it again.  Wont get my money ever again.
tL4McUzXfFI,Which arc should I watch first?
tL4McUzXfFI,Trash propaganda
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this the new face of the alt-right?
tL4McUzXfFI,At first I was like wow they are making a movie about white kids who were boy scouts and grew up to be great men and help build America into the greatest country and like 20 sec in I was like ahhhh there it is.
tL4McUzXfFI,For 20 seconds this feels like a Wes Anderson trailer.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Any movie credit which has the name of taika waititi, I will definitely going to watch it. He's hilarious."
tL4McUzXfFI,More well-rounded than I expected.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Where is his stand?             



( sorry for that joke)"
tL4McUzXfFI,And then in 1945 he is made to fight the allied forces and die because he is 10
tL4McUzXfFI,Why he look like goob
tL4McUzXfFI,ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yay, part VI is finally on the way! The difference in animation style is rather extreme... Gotta trust Araki-san. He usually doesn’t disappoint."

tL4McUzXfFI,WTF
tL4McUzXfFI,"Great Stroy. And a message to all the German Nazis: In einer Pressemitteilung um den Drehbeginn herum sagte der Regisseur: „Ich bin ganz heiß, mit dem Dreh meiner Anti-Kriegs-Satire zu beginnen. Wir haben einen unglaublichen Cast versammelt und ich könnte nicht aufgeregter sein, die Nazis und ihre Überzeugungen zu veralbern. Dieser Film wird eine Menge Rassisten anpissen und das macht mich sehr glücklich"
tL4McUzXfFI,Stephen Merchant ! My man !
tL4McUzXfFI,"I hear the german Version of David Bowie, i press like"
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait to see a Cyborg Nazi fighting the ultimate life form
tL4McUzXfFI,Didnt know Stroheim had a kid
tL4McUzXfFI,Who would have thought stroheim admired joseph so much he named his son after him
tL4McUzXfFI,"So basically,Black Widow's Son is mentored by Korg who is playing Hitler well in a Nazi childen's camp headed by Justin Hammer with Caliban as secret agent or what , not being allergic to light."
tL4McUzXfFI,Another Hitler Movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow,where are Jonathan,jotaro,Joseph etc.? Wtf"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is that supposed to be Anne Frank?
tL4McUzXfFI,Всем 88! пацаны!

tL4McUzXfFI,Disney is worried this movie might upset the Alt-Right and Conservatives? What year it is? What country do we live in?
tL4McUzXfFI,Just checking the comments for JoJo memes
tL4McUzXfFI,My mind just got blown. Hard.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is Scarlet Johanson transgender? She looks it. Timber.

tL4McUzXfFI,I can feel the bias critic reviews for this movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,I'd rather go to a specific camp than see this movie......🧐

tL4McUzXfFI,Drop Dead Adolf Hitler Fred. I can already hear the SJW's Weeping for The NAZI's.

tL4McUzXfFI,"A  boy named JoJo with an imaginary friend on an adventure of love and friendship, sounds alot like the barebones JoJo bizarre adventure plot I hope Taika Waititi knew what JoJo's was and put in a little easter egg. IE when Imaginary Hitler appears a certain songs starts playing or something else subtle."
tL4McUzXfFI,"If that girl's name is Ann Frank,......."
tL4McUzXfFI,Stephen Merchant was born to play a Nazi or the child catcher in a remake of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

tL4McUzXfFI,"What the hell on a God's flat green earth I just watched? I guess weed is no longer cool in Hollywood, they moved on to mushrooms."
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 is finally here.... back to Stroheim!
tL4McUzXfFI,🤦🏼‍♂️ Hollywood has officially lost it’s mind with shit like this.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow Araki didn't even finish part 9 and skipped right to part 10
tL4McUzXfFI,And I see movie makers are moving back into the “WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH!?” direction again.
tL4McUzXfFI,Rebel Wilson and like that you’ve lost me
tL4McUzXfFI,Why not simply say the month.... sick of seeing fall in every trailers
tL4McUzXfFI,"With all the PC, I'm kinda confused. Is this movie mocking Trump supporters?? I'm surprised this trailer was released."

tL4McUzXfFI,if you get offended at a satirical fictional film you most likely have paper-thin bitch skin.
tL4McUzXfFI,Ah taika <3
tL4McUzXfFI,"I dont know how I didnt expect there to be tons of JoJo memes in the comments, but I am glad that there are. Thanks for the laughs everyone :)"
tL4McUzXfFI,1:13 what does hitler say here?
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is after the universe reset huh?
tL4McUzXfFI,"everyone's a gangster until JoJo says: ""what the fuck did you just say about German Science?"""
tL4McUzXfFI,"I always knew that what Araki truly wanted to create was Von Stroheim's Bizzare Adventure, and here it is"
tL4McUzXfFI,Just came here to see JoJo shitposting
tL4McUzXfFI,"Excuse me, but the what the f*ck?"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait.. We can make fun of Hitler again? Hooray!


Just last year, even the mention of him just to mock him gets you fired from your job, your personal info doxxed, and your life ruined."
tL4McUzXfFI,"The comments be like
1% great film
99% jojo references"
tL4McUzXfFI,"this trailer should be called ""JOJO-RABBIT-HDVDRIP-FULL-MOVIE-4K-[HD]"" cuz Ive seen the whole movie now"
tL4McUzXfFI,I really want to unsee this shit
tL4McUzXfFI,Damn this looked bad
tL4McUzXfFI,Can we all appreciate how good the child actor performances are.
tL4McUzXfFI,SONO CHI NO SADAME
tL4McUzXfFI,Child actors. Good thing scarjos in it. No one will notice if the kids act shitty
tL4McUzXfFI,looks awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,"Disney: 'Taika you want to do Thor again?'
Taika: 'Sure, just have to play Hitler first.'

tL4McUzXfFI,TAIKAAAAAA ❤️❤️❤️❤️
tL4McUzXfFI,Enjoy it. Before it gets Cancelled or MeToo'd or smthn
tL4McUzXfFI,I was wondering how on earth Taika was going to pull off a Nazi themed movie with himself as Hitler... now I got it and I am pumped as heck to see this
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so cringe
tL4McUzXfFI,*GOODBYE JOJO!*
tL4McUzXfFI,Not funny
tL4McUzXfFI,"...I am severely disappointed... It’s exactly as I saw it to be, I cannot believe the utter stupidity and lack of horror in such things as WW2, Nazis should not be in a kids film period, and they were not calm creatures, they tried summoning demons, they created weapons of destruction, they murdered, pillaged, plundered, this is unacceptable, they tortured, they did not however hire ten year olds to hold explosive weapons.
But I have to say I am quite amused at the absurdity."
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare yare daze
tL4McUzXfFI,"Inglorious bastards, the prequel"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Before Thor Ragnarok I didn’t knew who Taika Waititi was but right there I fell in love with him , now I see him everywhere I even caught this weekend the Green Lantern movie, first ok it’s horrible but still it’s Ryan Reynolds and the guy is really entertaining to watch but then I even notice that Taika Waititi was playing a friends of Ryan and even then he said or did something funny that I never noticed before, man I wish I knew him for real I’m sure that every minutes with him must be entertaining as hell you never know what stupid thing’s gonna cross his minds or what’s he’s gonna say or disguised himself in 
We so need more pepoles like him that a big change from the horrible worlds we lives in today’s. 😍😍"
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow! This seems like a great movie. Finally I've been this excited to see a movie.
tL4McUzXfFI,Hope Kars doesn't show up...
tL4McUzXfFI,Filthy Acts At A Reasonable Price
tL4McUzXfFI,"228/5000
another propaganda movie demonizing the white man and the traditional values as Nazi, this time explicitly and hypocritically in a comedy ... know that their manipulation techniques are losing effectiveness"
tL4McUzXfFI,"A comedy about Nazi germany

tL4McUzXfFI,BBBBRRAKAAMONOGAAA
tL4McUzXfFI,Those poor innocent Jews who never did anything wrong always getting kicked out of countries for no reason. The Palestinians deserve what they get.
tL4McUzXfFI,Muda muda muda
tL4McUzXfFI,"I've been trying to get into the JOJO's Bizarre Adventure series, is this a place to start?"

tL4McUzXfFI,Finaly someone will make a banger movie about my boy hitler
tL4McUzXfFI,I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the movie of the year. When the actual movie comes out it can get it's own award like the Nobel peace prize or something
tL4McUzXfFI,1:03 only german will understand that joke 😅
tL4McUzXfFI,I can hear the SJWs crying from here!
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,Who needs a stone mask when you can be the first STAND user
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid in the specs is amazing. This could be some good fun.
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,putin youngarmy🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow and i thought a bogeyman in the closet was scary.
tL4McUzXfFI,Took brass balls to make a movie like this. Most audiences are too stupid to see the satire in anything these days
tL4McUzXfFI,nazis are so hot right now
tL4McUzXfFI,the german version of the song Heroes made my day
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the first time I heard the song Heroes in German
tL4McUzXfFI,SABAKUNO WA ORE NO STANDO DA... oh wait wrong series
tL4McUzXfFI,Where are the stands?
tL4McUzXfFI,"This movie looks very clever and funny I just really hope they don't ruin it by squeezing in some ""orange man bad"" shit."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Well, now you've summond the JoJo fandom"
tL4McUzXfFI,This trailer is a perfection!

-ДЖО!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Aww this looks sweet, also some STUNNING cinematography and I LOVE the use of colors in this."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I feel bad for the people making this movie. It's probably a decent comedy flick, but given all those recent right wing neonazi mass shootings in America... Yeah, people might not give it the chance it may deserve."
tL4McUzXfFI,"You think you was talking with great leader of Germany, but it was me, DIO!
 WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is a comedy in a ww2 universe
tL4McUzXfFI,Who's Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,This film looks so funny and yet so serious
tL4McUzXfFI,This is gonna be good
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo? JOJO?
tL4McUzXfFI,"It's fake,, it's not Jojo part 6"
tL4McUzXfFI,Spoiler: and then the Soviet soldiers came and finished the booth.
tL4McUzXfFI,Filmmakers still exist!
tL4McUzXfFI,Nani? Stando!?
tL4McUzXfFI,Fun fact I had a wet dream with Taika as Hitler. Don't ask
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is a version of Boy in the striped pyjamas
tL4McUzXfFI,So wait....we censor swastika's in zombies but not a live action film?
tL4McUzXfFI,I feel like my username can be misinterpreted now
tL4McUzXfFI,The Irony is whenever I see a Nazi symbol it reminds of Israel and their leaders .
tL4McUzXfFI,"Will they eat ""Ceasar"" salad? I think it is a good dish"
tL4McUzXfFI,Fox anime adaptation still throw the original out the window
tL4McUzXfFI,Where's the *「Stand」* at?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I think even Jewish people are going to see this movie. 





Like me"
tL4McUzXfFI,Take my goddamn wallet
tL4McUzXfFI,Just another movie that the jews made to make us feel bad for them 😂😂... I dont see any Hollywood movies showing what the jews did to Palestine or how they treated Moses
tL4McUzXfFI,Johan von joestar:iron eagle
tL4McUzXfFI,Fucking Rebel Wilson
tL4McUzXfFI,So you're telling me Stroheim of the SBR Universe was a JOJO??
tL4McUzXfFI,Yare yare
tL4McUzXfFI,this director is genius
tL4McUzXfFI,"Disney CEO: Guys scour social media for any criticism of this movie, we cannot have people thinking our polynesian jew director might me a nazi sympathizer."
tL4McUzXfFI,_BBBBAKA MONOGA! DOITSU NO KAGAKU HA SEKAI ICHI!!_
tL4McUzXfFI,I am gonna love this movie. I can already tell.
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this the Stroheim origin story we have all been waiting for?
tL4McUzXfFI,I was expecting to see a movie about an anthropomorphic rabbit. Disappointed.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo fans when they see unsucked cock
tL4McUzXfFI,This is obviously not JoJo!
tL4McUzXfFI,I REJECT YAWEH JOJO!
tL4McUzXfFI,The last time I heard the song in this trailer was when I watched the final episode of Regular Show.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a Jojo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,IM SO EXCITED
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wait, Taika Waititi is involved? SIGN ME UP"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Do you hear that?
It's the sound of a hoard of Jojo fans in the comment section."
tL4McUzXfFI,This is Discusting
tL4McUzXfFI,"Another Jojo with Hitler stand!!! 
Only jojo fans will understand."
tL4McUzXfFI,"That's how you fight the upcoming nationalist swell in the world. You let young people who feel disaffected and want to be part of a club see that it's the feeling of belonging to a group they want, not the hate towards others that the vultures of nationalism try to indoctrinate them with. I'm so looking forward to this. I know I'm idealizing here, but I'm guessing this movie pulls a few prime recruitment candidates for nationalism back from the brink before the hateful predators can fully lock them in. Hats off to Taika and co."
tL4McUzXfFI,"0:30
Looks like the fat blonde Nazi turned resistance fighter from Wolfenstein 2😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if the wooden doors make a cameo in this
tL4McUzXfFI,"Did they just play ""I'm a Believer"" in German?  This is gonna be good"
tL4McUzXfFI,"The Irony of this coming out at this time is priceless. *In the movie you got Socialist Nazi forcing people to be Socialist Nazi, in real life you got Left wing SJW forcing people to be Left wing SJW.* (Can it be same strategy? OH MY)"
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow great!  90 minutes of continuous rasism!
tL4McUzXfFI,And this wasn't made by Wes Anderson!
tL4McUzXfFI,Did they really make a Twilight reference? This is amazing.
tL4McUzXfFI,I better see a monument to stroheim somewhere
tL4McUzXfFI,Braaaaakamonokaaaaaaa!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a Stroheim spin-off?
tL4McUzXfFI,God I love Taika
tL4McUzXfFI,Dio!!
tL4McUzXfFI,2:11 did they shrink Nick Frost for this movie to play a kid?
tL4McUzXfFI,"""Jojo must confront his blind nationalism."" They can't even have a funny slapstick comedy film without some anti-white annefrank propaganda storyline. The premise of a wacky slapstick Hitler youth they showed at the start is great but they are just using that to sugar coat their poison their anti-white propaganda, and I'm not interested."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Opening Night, and again on Sunday."
tL4McUzXfFI,This Netflix adaptation of Battle Tendency looks promising
tL4McUzXfFI,Seems like Moonrise Kingdom. But with nazis. Weird idea for movie. After Rangerrok couldn’t he have picked a better project ?
tL4McUzXfFI,0:28 FTFY: From 👉VISIONARY👈 Director of Thor: Ragnarok and Hunt for the Wilderpeople 😂😂
tL4McUzXfFI,I want to firmly believe this is strongheilm illegitimate child that named him JoJo in honour of his friend.
tL4McUzXfFI,Jotaro...
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference
tL4McUzXfFI,Why did this movie steal Jojo Siwas first name?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow the new JJBA part looks how do you say, live action."
tL4McUzXfFI,What’re the songs for this trailer?
tL4McUzXfFI,I freaking love taika
tL4McUzXfFI,"When you spell JoJo like that, you know exactly what you're trying to attract."
tL4McUzXfFI,There are gonna be lots of baffled people reading the comments. Yare Yare
tL4McUzXfFI,Why do I have the sudden urge to fight a gay vampire and 3 pillar men?
tL4McUzXfFI,Yade yade daze..
tL4McUzXfFI,"I'll give Fox credit, they have some cojones releasing this in todays climate. No doubt, no matter how poignant an anti-fascist message this film presents, it will be controversial."
tL4McUzXfFI,"So the director of this movie will direct Akira live action? 😂
They seems like don't care about anime live action
Alita battle angel looks okay but the other is a nightmare cmon Hollywood you guys can do better than this
But there's one perfect solution just don't make anime live action!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like a wes anderson abortion
tL4McUzXfFI,"People are gonna be dumb and offended, but it seems hilarious and cute af."
tL4McUzXfFI,NIGERUN DA YO
tL4McUzXfFI,"Why are the speaking english with a German accent?

Really looking forward to this."
tL4McUzXfFI,Anyone agree it give you that inglorious bastards vibe?
tL4McUzXfFI,"8/10, no Stroheim."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Heh, I wonder if this is an actual movie... Oh wait... Its not because its 2019"
tL4McUzXfFI,A German and an American  got high and wrote a script together?
tL4McUzXfFI,Even speedwagon is afraid
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo fans are a fucking blight on humanity and this comment section proves it.
tL4McUzXfFI,not interesting
tL4McUzXfFI,Now we can see why araki didnt make PHF
tL4McUzXfFI,So his stand is litellar Hitler?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Hitler be like, *""I REJECT MY HUMANITY, JOJO!""*"
tL4McUzXfFI,Jojo reference?

tL4McUzXfFI,"Now Hollywood knows who to deal with, in case Wes Anderson's not available."
tL4McUzXfFI,"ok, you have my attention"
tL4McUzXfFI,1:43 Where is that? That city looks familiar to me.
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh ja
tL4McUzXfFI,So this is the Stroheim origin story we’ve been waiting for
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to be a bizarre adventure.
tL4McUzXfFI,*HOLY MOLY IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!*
tL4McUzXfFI,A story about Nazis that uses them more as a narrative tool than the subject? Sign me up.
tL4McUzXfFI,I have... several questions.
tL4McUzXfFI,Loml😩❤🔥
tL4McUzXfFI,I don’t remember this from part 2...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Among all the things to seemingly love about the movie, the fact that Stephen Merchant is playing a Nazi is amazing. Especially if you are farmiliar with his take on being the 'poster-boy' from the old Ricky Gervais show on XFM."
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm def seeing this
tL4McUzXfFI,"German science is the World’s greatest!!!!!
SEKAICHIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hello my name is jojo and my stands name is Hitler

tL4McUzXfFI,I’m expecting Stroheimn
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a movie with balls
tL4McUzXfFI,"""burn down the house and blame Winston Churchill!!""

tL4McUzXfFI,Scarlett Johansson is a Jew lmao
tL4McUzXfFI,Its.. a..?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jokes aside, this movie looks great"
tL4McUzXfFI,...its time to burn some books....then we'll build from there.
tL4McUzXfFI,Finally a movie I support!!
tL4McUzXfFI,2/10 not even one MUDA MUDA
tL4McUzXfFI,so this is part 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,"I dont know whats more funnier, taika waititi as hitler or the german version of Heroes of david bowie"
tL4McUzXfFI,The only thing that makes sense is nothing makes sense - Korg
tL4McUzXfFI,Damn Scarlett is having a killer year
tL4McUzXfFI,Does it involve stroheim?
tL4McUzXfFI,This is absolutely stupid. Which isnt surpirsing becauseThor Ragnarok was stupid and boring.
tL4McUzXfFI,*WE'RE GETTING A JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE MOVIE BASED AROUND STROHEIM?*
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait. Is Jojolion over?
tL4McUzXfFI,Damn Araki This looks like the weirdest part yet
tL4McUzXfFI,Is Diego Brando in the Movie???
tL4McUzXfFI,I only came here for the jojo reference comments
tL4McUzXfFI,You could say it's ... JoJo's bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm surprised today's society will let this be in theaters.
tL4McUzXfFI,JoJo JoJo JoJo Jojo!!!!!!! Kono Dio daaaa!!!!
tL4McUzXfFI,I thought I was the only kid whose imaginary friend was Hitler.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand Name: Hitler
Stand Master: JoJo"
tL4McUzXfFI,This...doesn't look bad actually
tL4McUzXfFI,"Yeah, the movie sounds awesome. But the thing is, sadly, I don't think they will let us have this here in Germany..."
tL4McUzXfFI,Only this trailer deserve an Oscar!
tL4McUzXfFI,Did Bowie record Heroes in German or did they get an impeccable impersonator?
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand user: Jojo
Stand name: Adolf Hitler"
tL4McUzXfFI,i love the version of david bowie’s “heroes” in bad german 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,Now I just want to know if I could share this on FB without getting zucc'd
tL4McUzXfFI,"I believe this movie will be a great comedy, but it will also fail horribly. The only reason being the nazis. I dont think this movie is bad for this, but I believe there will definitely be people who will wabt this movie banned. This movie looks wonderfully entertaining, too bad the media and culture of todays society will lable it and try to burn it to the ground. Thank god its not a video game, because then it would already be dead before the trailers hit youtube."
tL4McUzXfFI,This Will Red Pill More People than it Thinks it Will...
tL4McUzXfFI,Little Stroheim
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damm, feel like i watched the whole movie, the credits really sold it"
tL4McUzXfFI,And pewdiepie is an antisemi nazi...
tL4McUzXfFI,It's a perfect comedy movie from Fox Searchlight Pictures.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Stand user: JoJo
Stand name: [The Fürher]"
tL4McUzXfFI,JOJO!
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm guesing the hitler character is a figment of his imagination
tL4McUzXfFI,ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
tL4McUzXfFI,"*sees nazis*

They're just just gonna skip phantom blood?!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Aren't there more actors in Hollywood? Lol it's the same fucking people in all the movies.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn, what a cast, but why such a long trailer ?"
tL4McUzXfFI,How is this song called at the end of the trailer
tL4McUzXfFI,Pensé que era de west Anderson
tL4McUzXfFI,Pretty sure that’s not how one handles a loaded panzerschreck (or however it’s spelled)
tL4McUzXfFI,"Rudol von Stroheim looks great






wait this isn't JoJo"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Am I the only weirded out by the ""friendly"" portrayal of Hitler?"
tL4McUzXfFI,Inglourious Basterds should make a cameo at least in the and of the this film (like MARVEL used to do ;) ) !!
tL4McUzXfFI,Uhhhhhhhhhhh this is a weird idea.
tL4McUzXfFI,From the director of Thor Ragnorock more like Bore Ragnorock Zing!
tL4McUzXfFI,How this is NOT directed by Wes Anderson?
tL4McUzXfFI,At first I was like ehhh but as the trailer went on it seems like it could be good
tL4McUzXfFI,Wtf is this supposed to mean ? A kids show a adult show? Comedie cus i aint laughing .
tL4McUzXfFI,"so this is like after Jonathon, before Joseph...but maybe during Pillar Men...? I get that the kid's Stand is Hitler but like when does shit fit into the timeline"
tL4McUzXfFI,Prequel to Battle Tendency
tL4McUzXfFI,Not the JoJo I was expecting
tL4McUzXfFI,Oh look. Another movie making fun and dehumanizing Germans. How much longer is this going to go on?
tL4McUzXfFI,Speed-va-GON
tL4McUzXfFI,"40% here for the movie

tL4McUzXfFI,I'm really looking forward to this film. Taika Waititi is one brilliant bastard. I freaking love him. Full homo.

tL4McUzXfFI,😴😴😴😴😴😴😴 BORING TRASH NEXT
tL4McUzXfFI,Make this into a Trilogy!
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 6 looks extra bizarre. Weird how they are making it live action.
tL4McUzXfFI,I am going to predict that the media will loose its collective shit over this trailer

tL4McUzXfFI,2:01 LOL! This looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,Taika is a genius! Can’t wait for this film
tL4McUzXfFI,A I see a man of culture
tL4McUzXfFI,"There's literally nothing funny about the third reich,or kids in the Hitler youth, but once again, TV doesn't seem to care....
14year old kids were sent into battle and lots of them died!
I don't think the US would like to see a comedy series about slavery or mass shootings!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Your not a Nazi JoJo
Fine then, I REJECT MY HUMANITY!!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Wait so this isn't about the stone of Asa ?
tL4McUzXfFI,German techhnology is the best in the world!
tL4McUzXfFI,Johansson in a nazi jacket does strange things to me..
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks so good lol
tL4McUzXfFI,"Okay. I'm German and I didn't understand any German word they tried to speak. I had to listen to it 3 times to actually understand what the hell they were saying. This is so fckn wired. I mean I understood 100% of the English language but wtf did they do with the poor german phrases like ""Gesundheit""... ?!🤕🤦‍♀️😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,I was gonna post Jo joke but it seems over 70% of the comments beat me to it.
tL4McUzXfFI,"I already can see all the JoJo comments..
Edit: yup it's everywhere"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Oh my gosh this looks so good! Also, between this and Marriage Story, go get that Oscar Nom Scar Jo!!!"

tL4McUzXfFI,I am sure of that in the last this movie will make everyone cry
tL4McUzXfFI,"Wow, that boy looks like he could be ScarJo’s real kid. That’s some dead ass casting."
tL4McUzXfFI,1:00 lmao that twilight reference
tL4McUzXfFI,Fooking knew German science was zeee bessstt. Wonder if he's a spy for the Brits like his family line was.
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm pretty that this Movie is going to be Banned from playing in every single Movie Theater in Germany.

tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn, I´m so looking forward to this. I can´t remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie trailer."
tL4McUzXfFI,Why are they speaking English?

tL4McUzXfFI,Even Stroheim like that
tL4McUzXfFI,"Jews look like us.

LOL."
tL4McUzXfFI,Reminder: anyone who died in this film could be Diavolo.
tL4McUzXfFI,"New JOJO series looks great. I wish I could be surprised that they made his stand Hitler, but that seems normal for the series now."
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow i cant wait for movie #1354 about World War Two and the Holocaust!
tL4McUzXfFI,"Anyone come for ""Jojo""?"

tL4McUzXfFI,"Last line of the trailer : it's definitely not the right time to be a Nazi. 
What are you talking about kid. Go to America 😂😂😂"
tL4McUzXfFI,"If face value, in Monty Python irreverent fashion, looks like a funny film. 
If the entire movie is intended as a veiled anti-Trump political ad going into the 2020 election, pretty amazing the lengths Hollywood would go to in making Hitler, the death of 50 million people, extermination camps, etc. funny stuff and a good time for all."
tL4McUzXfFI,On the fence...but hey at least more stuff to make fun of hitler with
tL4McUzXfFI,Lol
tL4McUzXfFI,Liam Nelson gave this film two thumbs up 👍

tL4McUzXfFI,"This looks good, but I am a little nervous that Fox Searchlight is making a movie about Nazis."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks awesome
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to be one bizarre adventure.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Did DICE make this?
I thought only Battlefield could put woman in combat roles."
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler isn't an imaginary friend but a stand. That's the real reason nobody can see him
tL4McUzXfFI,ah yes the Black Widow prequel
tL4McUzXfFI,Uh... yeah..... looks like a straight  to dvd type of film 😂🤣
tL4McUzXfFI,Aw this movie looks cute
tL4McUzXfFI,The song sounds like we could be heroes just for one day
tL4McUzXfFI,This is going to be a bizarre adventure.
tL4McUzXfFI,Mel Brooks should be proud. Making fun of Nazis. Robbing them of their power through fear. That takes guts!
tL4McUzXfFI,this looks like more Hollywood attempts to push anti nationalism messages which is text book communism
tL4McUzXfFI,"I wish I had a Hitler Stand. And his special attack would be Blitzkrieg.
About the movie: I hope it's wont to be an only anti-nazi movie, I hope we get jew jokes too, then."

STAND RUSH: 99 Luftballons
STAND CRY: NEINEINEINEINEINEIN…"
tL4McUzXfFI,"Plot Twist, the girl's name is DIO"
tL4McUzXfFI,Ofcourse a japanese normalizing the german regine and making them feel like they were good guys. Fuck this movie and everything it stands for.
tL4McUzXfFI,Not fucking cool yeah let's make a movie about a guy who murdered thousands of innocent people
tL4McUzXfFI,Brown shirts = Antifa

tL4McUzXfFI,"Guys i can't understand what they're saying, Yo anyone here can translate to English?!"
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don’t follow too much Hollywood news or The Who’s-who in Hollywood these days, so hopefully I’m wrong, but I’m predicting this movie is nothing but a 2020 campaign ad for the democrat party, and Hitler character you can easily predict, the first 5 seconds of the film, is OBVIOUSLY metaphorically Trump, bunking their audience stupid, the makers of this film, then revealing their obvious attempt to make parallels more so candidly at the end of the film. I hope I’m wrong, because otherwise looks clever and funny."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn, Scarlett Johansson is so hot..."
tL4McUzXfFI,Cringe 👎
tL4McUzXfFI,What an absolute oscar bait
tL4McUzXfFI,A german joestar

tL4McUzXfFI,The Jojo fanbase is going to conquer this comment section.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Funny how a mere mention of the name JoJo is enough to send people crazy, no matter how out of context it is.
Oh, and Jew and Polynesian is such a rare mixture. No offense."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I am giorno giovanna and i have a dream

tL4McUzXfFI,Wow Part 9 really is looking Bizarre
tL4McUzXfFI,HO....SO YOU'RE APPROACHING ME?

tL4McUzXfFI,"Get ready people, the antisemites are going to be really salty"
tL4McUzXfFI,Hitler's bizarre adventure
tL4McUzXfFI,"Make a movie ridiculing the british of the 1900's and promoting nazi ideals, oh wait the victor writes the history"
tL4McUzXfFI,The new Wolfenstein looks really interesting!
tL4McUzXfFI,Great trailer!!!!! This film looks very good!
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks like it's going to be both hilarious and very preachy.
tL4McUzXfFI,"So were not gonna address the elephant in the room?...that this movie makes it look like its okay to be a Nazi... that they're ""not so bad"".... wtf :S"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is the movie we need right now.

tL4McUzXfFI,You tell this was most definitely not made in Germany that I’m sure of.
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this Stroheim's Backstory?
tL4McUzXfFI,Part 9 looks amazing. JoJo's stand 「DER KOMMISSAR」has a really cool design.
tL4McUzXfFI,Taiki watiti is an amazing good filmmaker and is such a chill person

tL4McUzXfFI,I wish it was a jojo bizzare adventures live action movie hopefully
tL4McUzXfFI,Can't wait to see how Disney fucks this movies.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Spoiler alert and my prescient prediction: You’ll see a funny and probably cleverly written and well acted movie for 117 minutes, then an awkward 3 minute ending-linking the charismatic-clownish Hitler as A Trump metaphor. They’ll self inflict what probably could be a great movie ,dropping the ball and fumbling on the one yard yard line, thinking their audience, stupid, making the entire movie a political point. You watch."
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn Part 2.5 looks great, I’ve always wanted Stroheim’s backstory"
tL4McUzXfFI,out of all of the words to put before rabbit they chose that one
tL4McUzXfFI,I didn't think a comedy about Hitler in one of the worst atrocities that ever committed was this funny
tL4McUzXfFI,Wes Anderson’s Inglourious Basterds
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this a JoJo reference?
tL4McUzXfFI,DIO: *_JOJO?!!_*
tL4McUzXfFI,IS THIS

tL4McUzXfFI,This is JOJO REFERENCE??¿??
tL4McUzXfFI,"I don't who is Jojo...
And at this point, I am too afraid to ask"
tL4McUzXfFI,looks good.
tL4McUzXfFI,A part of me LOVES this but another part of me CRINGE!   Anyone else feel the same!
tL4McUzXfFI,Anne Frank meets Hitler..seems to be a safe Oscar bet for this season..Joker seems to be too divisive choice..
tL4McUzXfFI,Wow. I'm certainly looking forward to this one.
tL4McUzXfFI,"My name is Ceasar Zeppelli,
You killed my Nazi friend,
Prepared to die!"
tL4McUzXfFI,Is this kids stand named HITLER?!
tL4McUzXfFI,See what a director can do when a studio doesn't shove their formula down his throat?
tL4McUzXfFI,I can see the riots already.
tL4McUzXfFI,"Instead of live-action Akira, Taika should just do live-action Jojo"
tL4McUzXfFI,Nvm i thought of some *Other* jojo
tL4McUzXfFI,"I came here to make a Jojo reference, but after watching the trailer... I'm wondering what in the nine Hells I just watched."
tL4McUzXfFI,BRAKKAAAAAA MONOGAAAAAA
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if we'll see Stroheim in this movie in the new Part 9 of Jojos Bizarre Adventures.
tL4McUzXfFI,Thank CHRIST they're not sticking 100% with the plot of the book. Caging Skies is depressing as shit.
tL4McUzXfFI,This is just part 2 all over again
tL4McUzXfFI,part 9 main jojo confirmed
tL4McUzXfFI,"We have wonderfull hits,  played in germans,  this is gonna be a wonderful movie"
tL4McUzXfFI,I'm already feeling the feels
tL4McUzXfFI,Take my money
tL4McUzXfFI,"The idea is a pretty radical one in 2019, that a person can be victim to hateful ideology and NOT be an inherently bad person undeserving of love and a second chance. This feels more like a movie that would have been made in the 70s than something you could expect the cancel culture media to tolerate in 2019."
tL4McUzXfFI,SO THEY FUCKING MAKING A COMEDY OUT OF NAZIS? Well we had a good run bois. I'm moving to venus
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks great and funny

tL4McUzXfFI,This must be a work of an enemy stand
tL4McUzXfFI,"Damn, Part 9 is Stroheim spinoff? count me in"
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope Disney releases it🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
tL4McUzXfFI,That movie is gonna end soo badly
tL4McUzXfFI,"There’s several factions at play in the theatre:
The casual movie goers who want to see a funny and risqué movie about nazis.
Nazis who claim to be sick of semite trickery.
SJWs who think this movie will highlight the absurdity of the third reich and finally
Weebs who think it’s a fucking jojo reference."
tL4McUzXfFI,wtf did I just watch
tL4McUzXfFI,This proves they were right tho https://youtu.be/88sYkSqkecI
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like Von stroheim backstory

tL4McUzXfFI,Hearing David bowies heroes on german is unsetteling

tL4McUzXfFI,Clicked on the Video to see JoJo comments but the movie seems interesting. Well i hope i can see the movie uncensored here in germany.
tL4McUzXfFI,Hollywood creativity is dead making trash like this
tL4McUzXfFI,*JJBA PART 9 LEAAKED!!!*

tL4McUzXfFI,"I hope this doesn't get canceled because of controversy, having a comedy in the times of Hitler sounds like an actually hilarious concept xD"
tL4McUzXfFI,Woah...so we are going to another universe for part 9?
tL4McUzXfFI,lol Disney are releasing a movie about Nazi Germany and the Hitler Youth
tL4McUzXfFI,*PART 9 BABY*

tL4McUzXfFI,"Love the new part, Araki is really pushing it"
tL4McUzXfFI,Again I can't see Jojo's Stand
tL4McUzXfFI,"So this is what Jojos part 9 will be like. Looks pretty good, but not enough pillar men or Speedwagon."
tL4McUzXfFI,This looks really bad.
tL4McUzXfFI,The kid with the glasses is so adorable OMG!!!😭😭😭

tL4McUzXfFI,This backstory of Stronheim looks great
tL4McUzXfFI,"This film is definite success just because the amount of Jojo fans who will watch this movie.

But the movie itself looks awesome tho"
tL4McUzXfFI,Seems like a good Wes Anderson movie that is not directed by Wes Anderson.
tL4McUzXfFI,I hope this gets its fair share at the box office. I’m tired seeing good non-superhero movies being bombed at the box office because people either love superhero movies or fucking trash.
tL4McUzXfFI,Looking forward to this one

tL4McUzXfFI,"I am a simple man. I see Taika Waititi, I click like."
tL4McUzXfFI,It's all so tiresome...
tL4McUzXfFI,"Once again, amazing cinematography, but bland humor. This type of thing only worked in Thor because it contradicted his character"
tL4McUzXfFI,"wait a minute, this isn't JoJo's Bizzare Adventure!?"
tL4McUzXfFI,This is so funny to watch as a german 😂
tL4McUzXfFI,This actually looks funny and I don't really like the ideologies that Hollywood is pushing
tL4McUzXfFI,This isn't the part 2 i know.

tL4McUzXfFI,"I am so confused. I wanna like this, I think I like this, but I feel like I SHOULDN'T like this."
tL4McUzXfFI,Bro dp really stepped up the budget this time. But no stands. Sad
tL4McUzXfFI,I wonder if Deacon and other Nazi Vampires will make an appearance in this?
tL4McUzXfFI,Hey black widow HAIL HYDRA

It's finally nice to know part 8 is ending."
tL4McUzXfFI,what a really weird stand that kid has got himself
tL4McUzXfFI,"Waittiti went full Anderson and you never go full Anderson.
Even Anderson never goes full Anderson because it's just too twee."
tL4McUzXfFI,"I thought this was gonna be about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
It's kind of close by how funny & ridiculous it is."

tL4McUzXfFI,"Never knew I needed  ""I'm a Believer"" in Germam"
tL4McUzXfFI,Y’know... Taika Waititi is probably the only director I would trust to film a actual live action adaption of JoJo Bizzare’s Adventure. Even better if he were to team up with Edgar Wright.
tL4McUzXfFI,Looks like a Wes Anderson movie
tL4McUzXfFI,"i see JOJO!!!

When you turn on the news, see crazy stuff and wonder who those people are, remember this line. It's very telling of the era we're living in. 

People who are lost, who are angry, who feel isolated, with no perceived purpose in life are the ones who are easiest to manipulate and are looking for a fight."

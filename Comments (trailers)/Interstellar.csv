zSWdZVtXT7E,hahaha...travelling to space is like taking a flight back n fro??? simpleton
zSWdZVtXT7E,STEP BY STEP - STEP#1
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Daily fantasy sports fan? Become fantasy sports royalty, only at statkings.com.﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"humanity already can survive any cataclysm...
we can borroow underground and live there (11000 meters unerground is more than enough to shild our kind for nearly any kin of threat)
termo and nuclear reactors + watter = nearly endless energy supply for a not that small community of 1-5 millions survivors (more than enough to save our kind)
energy can be used to grow crops even in total darkness, to create underground a normal ecosystem...
we alreay have enough knowledge to survive on earth, under earth and water, even to create a good spacestation for few thousands to live more than few generations...
our knowledge are far beyound our needs for survival of our kind...
but still we want more...not to be sure about our survivability but to spread our kind to new worlds...to have new beginings...to have new future...to have more diffirence...to study this world we all live in...to find something new...
most powerful force in humanity is Interest...love is only one of many kinds of it,,,

these films about space treveling are to grow interest in this direction to make it faster and cheaper for billioners and goverments

how many words of danger were said about ""need"" in this direction?
sun is dying, we need to look for a new home (nonsense! sun will be ""dying"" for next 5,000,000,000,000 years...its age total is like 4.500.000.000.000 years...when our kind's age by many ressearchers are less than 500.000 ...and known hisstory is less than 10.000 ....just few centuries ago we did't realize that our world isn't flat...)

we run out of food? i mean srsly? you must be joking cause ONLY GERMANY!!! DESTROYING EACH FUCKING YEAR 20.000.000 TONS!!! OF DAMN FOOD!!! which is nearly half of its own consumption!...and you talking about ""we runout of food""?????? O____o how damn stupid a common man is in their eyes?
or may be they are right...and we all that stupid so they don't need to ""waste"" their money to buy better scenarios? to make better movies?

only real point to leave this planet is to escape these govements to build better society...cause this one is sick as hell and there is no fucking way to change it..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Mixed reviews of this film, some critics say he came close to his masterpiece, others say you need to have swatted up on your quantum mechanics and that the plot is quite complex. In other words - it's going to be pure awesome, and possibly an epic adventure film meant for an intelligent audience for once. Hopefully."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm afraid this will be another disappointing sci-fi movie, like Gravity. It will probably be filled with all sorts of misconceptions about space, even though Kip Thorne has been the scientific consultant for it (and also executive producer). Remember the movie ""Sunshine"" from 2007? Brian Cox was the scientific consultant for that one, and yet the movie was filled with all sorts of misconceptions and inaccuracies that made me laugh.
And what about Gravity? That unknown force that pulled Clooney away from the ISS was a total joke, same for the orbital nonsense between the Hubble, the ISS and the Russian satellites, etc.

Just so you know, Interstellar tells the story of a group of astronauts who ""travel"" through a black hole...with hopes of going somewhere else and then return to Earth, that is. For all science knows, the laws of physics break down inside a black hole due to the tremendous gravitational pull, that means that we can't possibly know, through physics, what happens exactly to things that cross the ""event horizon"" (that's the edge of the black hole, so to speak). 
All science can tell for sure is that when something crosses the event horizon, there's no turning back, if you somehow managed to come out, it wouldn't be alive and in one piece. When Hawking talks about how it is possible for information to be preserved inside a black hole, it just means INFORMATION, in other words, the particles that form your body could still be ""preserved"" somehow but you would die nonetheless, all your atoms would be undone, and that isn't pretty.
Whoever tells you that you can travel through black holes (survive the journey and come back to the same universe as if nothing happened, that is), doesn't have the math/mechanism to support this claim and Kip Thorne knows it.
I bet all Kip has done is to help model the black hole, give direction to actors who will play scientist roles and perhaps a few more things, but I'm pretty sure this movie will still contain nonsense. Sci-fi directors usually claim they've made sure everything is scientifically accurate, showing us stuff like this>  Interstellar – Building A Black Hole – Official Warner Bros.
so people can say ""Oh! This time they've got it right!"" when, in reality, only some things are accurate, the rest is usually nonsense. Movies like Sunshine and Gravity are clear examples of this.
Curiously, there is a 1968 movie called ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (perhaps you've heard about it, LOL) that gets most things right, without the need of using unlikely black hole travel, without the need to sell it for its ""realism"" or scientific accuracy, without flashy special effects, absurd amounts of money and without being too pretentious.
The non-scientific parts of that movie are highly symbolic, which make it even better.

So Hollywood sci-fi movies nowadays have much larger budgets, a much higher availability of professionals from all branches, highly superior technology available, they generate much more money, etc. and yet they are worse every year... Why is that?
I think it's because the essential guidelines of the business are wrong. They go for flashiness (big names, high numbers, extreme and flashy plots, etc.) instead of quality, they try to conciliate science with nonsensical extreme plots that are completely incompatible and absurd (my point being> don't try to sell the movie for its realism and accuracy if, in the end, it won't be so).
This is the formula: big names + claims of scientific accuracy/realism + extreme plots filled with nonsense (the world is about to end, there's a critical accident/everything goes wrong, and the like) + stuff blowing up/getting destroyed + miraculous survivals + ultra hd cameras and all sorts of modern filters and effects + the hero saves the day (requiring his/her/their sacrifice, perhaps) = Next Hollywood sci-fi movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,like this trailer.......as always christospher nolan  the best
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like how he avoids using CGI whenever possible. Even the lighting here isnt bright/flashy.
It gives such realistic experience to his story telling. A lot of Hollywood films could learn from this kind of idea.
Cant wait to see this movie in theatres!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"soundtrack please
???????????????"
zSWdZVtXT7E,i feel like this movies is about how the illuminate plan to save themselves from the natural destruction that may come to earth in the future..
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Astronaut Farmer 2
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wanna thank Stanley kubrick behalf of all for his tremendous work in 2001:A Space Odyssey which leads to this creation .
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Song: Every Reborn - Dario Marianelli  -> Known from ""V for Vendetta"". "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Black holes don't exist
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The one thing I hate about moving to a small(er) town, there are NO IMAXes anywhere!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Interesting how this trailer uses music from V for Vendetta, Iv'e never heard of film using prior music scores at least for trailers. Can anyone shed light on this, or give other examples?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,much awaited movie for me
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait to go see this movie on 5th nov!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Stupid, stupid, stupid. The whole premise is stupid, the lines are stupid, the black hole/wormhole scene is stupid. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Heyy everyone. Check out my channel & my reaction the 3rd trailer of this movie. GOSH I am so excited.... Interstellar Trailer 3 Reaction
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So is this just ""fly into a black hole"" the movie essentially? Nolan sure knows how to make it seem a lot more interesting than that."
zSWdZVtXT7E,spoiler alert hes coming back
zSWdZVtXT7E,go further
zSWdZVtXT7E,"They used the soundtrack from V For Vendetta !!!!
Evey Reborn !!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Cant wait to watch this movie. Why you ask? Becuase ""JURASSIC WORLD"" trailer is being released in the preview of this movie!!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone recognise the music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan, McConnaughey and Zimmer.........really can't see how this one can fail :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The crew was killed, he never came back.  Well, that took 12 minutes to get to that point so this film will make more money per minute than any film before it.  Oh, the film is continuing?... it has them LIVE?!  WHAT!?  NO WAY!?  Oh look at all the pretty special effects.  Ok, let's have the IMPOSSIBLE happen because Kip Thorne wants to be known as an Imagineer like Einstein was, he wants his legacy to be that he imagined further than his knowledge should have allowed, he was a hero.  SO for that personal objective, we are now going to be fed a bag of worms about how people can survive going through a wormhole... oh great!  So first he tries to teach us that engineers are obsolete, then he tries to teach us that science built this thing!??  NOPE TO BOTH.  In the scenes they pull the power pack processing package from the Indian drone, as useful... oh wait, that's engineering.  Then they say we ran out of food, what... did engineering fail to come up with solutions?  NO WAY, engineers would have had people living where ever, with desalination wholesale, protected from radiation.  Listen, if engineering can build a star ship to go exploring to move MILLIONS of people off this planet, the same engineering would have built the systems to remake a new place to live on Earth, probably under the sea!  So this whole movie is based on... Kip Thorne playing around with his legacy.  So yeah, they all die and the movie ends after 12 minutes.  Let's all get refunds!!  hehe"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks really good. Glad that a big movie is coming out that has nothing to do with shooting at eachother
zSWdZVtXT7E,"God, this trailer made me tear a bit while watching it. And I blame it for Matthew McConaughey's brilliant acting. Can't wait to see it on IMAX screens."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Little Emma Stone is there 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like a gripping yet intelegent sci-fi movie, a rare thing these days. This is so on my to watch list. : )"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alfred!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Please don't be like the movie Red Planet.. hah
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sorry to say this but even as a Christopher nolan fan this film looks boring as hell
zSWdZVtXT7E,what a powerful film.
zSWdZVtXT7E,lame ..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Just as somebody commented, ""In Nolan we trust"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh Boy Oh Boy O Boy !!!!!!!! Can't wait.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Empire's coverage of Interstellar is incredible in itself. This movie is a definite must-see already.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan and Caine back together again <3
zSWdZVtXT7E,i hope they play this in the ending credits Planet Caravan - Black Sabbath
zSWdZVtXT7E,I saw the one movie not too long ago with astronauts in space trying to fix a satellite and all hell breaks loose. this seems like it goes beyond what the movie was trying to pull off. seeing imagination and creativity in space movies are always awesome. I would def watch this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want it in hungarian tooo!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer is a masterpiece in both music and dialog.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey was driving spacecrafts long before anybody paid him to drive one!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is overrated
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yeah I've watched a few of these trailers now and I fail to see what's so special about them. Or perhaps everyone else is on the Nolan bandwagon.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goosebumps! Can't wait!
zSWdZVtXT7E,INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL
zSWdZVtXT7E, #interesting  
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew deserve to be the next Bruce Wayne instead of Batfleck!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Daft Punk - Interstellar 5555
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan will never make a bad movie
That dude is really amazing
Memento and Inception are the two best movies I have ever watched
And do I need to say anything about the Batman movies"
zSWdZVtXT7E,well if its a nolan film and the score is from hans zimmer its definitely worth a movie ticket imo
zSWdZVtXT7E,please be friggin' awesome... PLEASE!! Nolan!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,so this is the mivie version of Civilisation Beyond Earth?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It takes a lot for me to express my ideas.  This move will be phenomenal, and the physicist/astro-physicist side of me takes hold.  This isn't just a movie.  It's about changing the way we think about the world as a whole.  It will take change - change in the way you think, feel, react, but it has to be done.  We won't survive unless we can adapt."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Simply the best trailer ever!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer gives me so many goosebumps. Soooo excited!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie can easily be a dream within a dream by talented, steadfast, in addition, reflective director, Christopher Nolan. He, Nolan, is a master, beyond time. We'll find a way as we always have to once again enter his world. Beyond time.﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can already see the Oscar nominations 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Of course...the NASA...and not ESA or any (!!!) other Space Agency...two American Crewmembers with a Hillbilly Pilot...bitch just killed my vibe
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dude i play the game its very cool we are creating our galaxy
zSWdZVtXT7E,George Clooney must be an astronaut!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Doesn't look very funny.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Movie looks breathtaking.  Can't wait to see it
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone know where I can get the music in this trailer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone know what the name of the music is ? I know it's from v for vendetta  
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Aaaaaaaaaaah, the girl from The Conjuring!!!!! She was amazing. So happy to see her in another hit movie :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The Prestige, Memento, Dark Knight, Inception, etc..
Nolan has never let me down, can't wait for this film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait to hear the full score!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love movies like this 💙 definitely a must see . I believe it's very possible for interstellar travel , just look at what us humans have already accomplished . It's amazing "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"let me get this straight

a movie about the world running out of food takes place in a lush, green field of corn

ooooookay "
zSWdZVtXT7E,what is the name of the soundtrack?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Deep
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can somebody please tell me the name of this piece of music? :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Great trailer but anyway people will some day be gone from earth because of our one faults of destoying the earth
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Every hour on this new planet is seven years on earth.  Bring an alien plant home, it grows at an excelerated rate on earth, now we eat.  Problem solved."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am so ready for this..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm looking forward to interstellar just as much as any film fan, but my only grip about the movie is that for a movie about "" saving the WORLD""  the people behind the mission who gives a damn is AMERICANS doing all the work with no help for other countries. which is a bit disturbing to see. A movie that solves this problem was Danny Boyle's Sunshine"
zSWdZVtXT7E,WHY ARE THEY USING MUSIC FROM V FOR VENDETTA?! WHYYYYYYYYYY
zSWdZVtXT7E,Trailer is very nicely done. Does anybody know the music used in this?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I havn't been this excited for a scifi movie in a long time. I've been waiting for another scifi that pushes the boundaries of fiction and introduces real science and philosophy. Looks fantastic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If space is infinite, there can be nothing that is unique. An infinite number of Earths, in an infinite number of variations. Only problem..they are each an infinite distance apart. Bummer!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,that music is v for vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,The trailer is already better than most recent sci-fi films.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why I think of Armageddon..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't understand the issue about ""mumbling"". I hear it perfectly clear. Maybe because I am a Finn, and used to people talking in strange ways to me.

But dubbing sucks. Nobody in his or her right mind would want to see a movie in any other language it is made. Unless we are talking of Disney or Dreamworks kiddie cartoons.

All that said, I expect this flick to kick major ass. Mine included."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Isnt the music ""Eve Reborn"" By Dario Marianelli, from V For Vendetta??"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I feel like Nolan asked Matthew McConaughey to do his best Christian Bale impression. I think it would have been more interesting had he asked Leonardo DiCaprio to do his best C. Bale impression. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spent the entire thing distracted by the use of the same music from Batman
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anybody else catch the V for Vendetta music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is anyone else peeved that they ripped off part of the soundtrack of V For Vendetta? You'd think that a *ahem* talented director like Nolan would be able to ""score"" some original music for the trailer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can someone please tell me the music for this specific trailer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murph is wearing his jacket @1:41#FEELS 

This film is gonna make me cry cause I have a feeling Murph will be an old woman by the time her dad comes back, and he will be YOUNGER than her..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"murfizlah: what ever can go wrong, will go south. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is That The stripper Cowboy from Magic Mike?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is weird that soundtrack isn't it from v for vendetta when evey is reborn?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is gonna be good
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Stephen Hawking believes humans need to leave this planet within the next 1000 years before all of its resources are used up due to overpopulation. That is being optimistic, 500 years is more likely. I don't see it happening considering the closest dwarf star that could possibly have a inhabitable planet in millions of light years away and we haven't even been to Mars yet. Personally I think it will be a pandemic that will wipe us out, especially how strong and resilient anti-biotic resistant bacteria has become."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Uk release date? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone know this music for this trailer? It's amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,I agree those words on the trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,big hero 6 it will be the winner of this weekend........................
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wants to see
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gud casting except annie hathaway
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is Neil deGrasse Tyson doing the black hole effects?
FYI Yes I know that it's technically a worm hole, but worm holes are theories formed from black holes, which are also theories, making worm holes... improbable.
Warp drive > worm hole"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't usually like Nolan, but this looks great. He seems to have stepped up his directing because this is top notch."
zSWdZVtXT7E,cant wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"
The music in the background is from V for Vendetta!﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,isn't that girl the one who played the role of Renesmee from Twilight Breaking Dawn?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Like others said I say : 'This is going to be great !' 
I wish we could travel in Space like that."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew is the next Tom hanks! I know it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I wish my self we could do this, travel to different worlds or to different galaxy. See clusters of stars, cluster of galaxies , and some nebula's parts. I love the beauty of just seeing the milky way, it is such beauty just to see it by the naked eye. But what make us think our Creator of this world would let us go out there? He would probably laugh us cause we can't even control our selves they right way on this world XD .... But FOR REAL .. Lord have mercy on us.. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,WALL-E
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks like its going to be sick as hell. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity (movie) X 2!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,that's more  like it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Someone help me, where have we heard this music before? It's been the soundtrack to another film but i can't quite place it. Meet Joe Black?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,BG is from Shawshank?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope movie ll hav best cosmic elements and contents....
zSWdZVtXT7E,"nah.... I already saw the movie ""Gravity"".. thats enough"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why have they ripped off the track from V for Vendetta???
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that the girl inprinted by the wolf?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Beyond earth.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,im confused please tell wat its about
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'll still watch it, even if people claim it sucks. I'm an astronomy junky that hopes to explore space someday"
zSWdZVtXT7E,What is the name of song in this trailer?? ~absolutely amazing~
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Loving that V for Vendetta music... ""God is in the rain."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cant tell if this is based on the mobile game lol or if the game is based on this. Even though the mobile game is already out. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Maybe the trailer does spoil some things since it shows that Matthew's children have become adults......
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ooooh, excited for this, loves me some space films.
Am curious about the music they used for this trailer, anyone know what it is? Sounds familiar."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Please do not disappoint..movies encompassing space travel normally end up being mediocre at best unless they are complete fantasy like star wars or star trek. since the groundwork of this movie is based on a derivation of reality, i am a bit cautious, nevertheless hopeful."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta \m/ (the music)
zSWdZVtXT7E,FINALLY A CHRISTOPHER NOLAN FILM AND NOT STUPID ASS MICHAEL BAY MOVIE!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love those kind of movies lol 
zSWdZVtXT7E,world doesnt need anymore engineers?! PFFT!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music from V for Vendetta.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"2nd Best CGI I've ever seen in a movie. 1st is Avatar, of course."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope they don't devote half the movie to his daughter's whining. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,pfff im so pumped up for this whole space sci fi epicness
zSWdZVtXT7E,Trailer looks  similar to works of inception and TDKR.Especially the stadium scene remainded me of TDKR stadium scene. Also will Nolan be able to meet huge expectation that the movie has been garnering????
zSWdZVtXT7E,Any one notice mackenzie from twighlight?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is a lazy writer who makes plot hole ridden scripts. And after the B movie style special effects from TDKR why be excited about this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What I if told you


You read the top line wrong"
zSWdZVtXT7E,AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""the world doesnt need anymore engineers""

words you will never hear any honest or serious professional say"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Super excited. Isnt the background score from V FOR VENDETTA? really sets the mood!
zSWdZVtXT7E,The trailer looked awful when I went to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm seeing this movie for the sake of The Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer being attached to it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,if i have to i will watch the cam print.......i cant wait for it to come to theaters that Looong....
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have strange feeling that this movie will be 90% drama and 10% (at very end) space travel which will be disapointment for all of you ""i cant wait this movie""..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,You know what makes this movie good???? 35MM FILM!!!!!! Suck on that digital lovers. 35mm film will always be superior to digital.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wouldn't the black hole rip apart the ship particle by particle? That's what I was tild in school anyway.
zSWdZVtXT7E,im crying
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Chris Nolan, Hans Zimmer, Michael Caine, Mathew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway............ I cannot wait.......This could not go without an Oscar......"
zSWdZVtXT7E,check out our parody on our page! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goddamn that soundtrack!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Elite : Dangerous
zSWdZVtXT7E,My science teacher is in this ??!!!!!! 0.41 secs in the dead centre hahaha
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vandetta music much xD
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music is feom v for vendetta ending
zSWdZVtXT7E,surely there has to be another michale caine somewhere. i'm getting tired of this one. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,As they were traveling there was 2 planets the first one looks like Jupiter and there was a second one that was black and there were stars rotating around it what planet is that or even if it is a planet ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow they hardly showed any Anne Hathaway. 
That's embarrassing "
zSWdZVtXT7E,So hyped for this
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh hai! Have you heard the talk about - TK Explosion Easy Website Builder (should be on google have a look)? Ive heard some interesting things about it and my cousin got amazing results with it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Greenhouse effect with rising carbon dioxide will spur on plant growth not diminish it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Greenhouse effect with rising carbon dioxide will spur on plant growth not diminish it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I already love it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,that's Oscar material
zSWdZVtXT7E,freaking great stuff!
zSWdZVtXT7E, Uhmmmm I don't know how to say this.....but I got the chills from that for some reason!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trip is the wing speed wing light or travel to other planets someone design me concerned
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I downloaded and played the phone game before I even knew it was a movie. Just today I saw the ""see interstellar blah blah blah"" and im watching the trailer now and I remember seeing it before but I didn't notice it was called this. And I have to say, the game is probably the best mobile movie game I've ever played. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,this movie will be remembered as the movie Christopher Nolan has become the best filmmaker in the world
zSWdZVtXT7E,This gonna be my favorite film
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really hope this is not a movie where 90 Minutes will show the problems on Earth (which I will find soon boring) and the last 10 Minutes is the exploring of another universe (which I crave for in a Sci-Fi Movie like this)... My advice for the film: 20 Minutes on Earth and the whole REST of the Movie askicking special effects...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Bet that even if it turns to be the best sci fi movie ever, its not going to win any oscar... "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow, this movie reminds me 2001 of Stanley Kubrick. Cool"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wonder if we could use wormholes as a travel alternative
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Very fictional flick....

Like most Nolan movies"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm coming back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hmmmmm. So engineers are no good at creating food supplies? I think the way modern society relies on modern techniques for cultivating and distributing food kind of suggests otherwise. Who wrote that twaddle? 
Wormhole is interesting. Just get off Earth asap and get to the bits we want to see in the film. I wonder what Spielbergs take on it would have been like?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,ALFRED! :')
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Now, What Just Happened ?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks boring
zSWdZVtXT7E,"E, V... Of course you are - Soundtrack Nerd"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So just like Inception with the whole was Cobb still dreaming cliff hanger, are we going to expect a did McConaughey make it back to Earth or was it just another Solar System with a planet that looked identical to Earth?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,world needs bad men
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks great.
zSWdZVtXT7E,watch the whole season of cosmos before you watch this :) we are not alone !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Someone please explain me the first 13-14 seconds of this trailer? Indian Survelliance Drone? Solar Powered Cells? Murphy's Law? What's the link between these and with a movie. I can soemehow draw connection to Murphy's Law but not with this drone part.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I wonder what the catch is to interstellar travel, time seems to be playing a major role.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,+Romit B. Movie is sick.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan's wife - You don't owe these people any more. You've given them everything.
Nolan - Not everything, not yet"
zSWdZVtXT7E,And you more thing Scottie hit light speed :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Same composer as V for Vendetta? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mackenzie Foy!!!<3
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan to me is beyond ""Hype"" i can't stand that word, Hype usually equites to a ""fad"" and Nolan's work isn't like that, He's very sincere with his work and his ambition as a storyteller, I truly think in my humble opinion that his best days are not over and this will be the biggest proof yet."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goosebumps. Every. Time.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The poor man's 2001 A Space Odyssey? Nah jk.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Amazing.   Is it legal to make something that dumb, that cliched, that badly written and witlessly scored.  Good lord. At least give us Bruce Willis. Not this dweeb."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music in the background is from V for Vendetta!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Could be very VERY good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this movie will be so serene and beautiful. like a painting ^^
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The great unknown . If you could really see how microscopic you are , then you would really feel fear in your soul ... And realize we are one ,( PEACE an LOVE ) No more violence 
Hate !"
zSWdZVtXT7E,One of the greatest trailers in movie history.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Without money and greed we can overcome anything. Why do we need a disaster to come together like brothers.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This world can be a better place if we just worked collectively. We need to get rid of money and greed. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,More Saturn Agenda hidden in plain sight!!!! 0_o
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone know the name of the soundtrack in this trailer? So good, I hope the OST is just as amazing as the OST for 2001 was "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks ridiculous
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan is definitely one of the best directors of this century. But he doesn't leave a powerful trademark or a sense of R-rated realism that movies by Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, David O Russell, David Fincher, Clint Eastwood, Wes Anderson and Spike Jonze do. 

I think this will be one of the best movies of this year. But I am more excited for Inherent Vice, Birdman and Winter Sleep."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity 2.0
zSWdZVtXT7E,People who say this is silly.. your wrong we might not ever travel interstellar but in days like this where war and money run the world hope is what keeps things alive and i love these movies they just make you think what if and strive for more.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Between this and Inception, I'm becoming more of a Christopher Nolan fan...every day."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie is going to be so powerful that it will rock the foundation of Science Fiction movies for many many years. Mark my word.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yeah, I really can't unhear 'Evey Reborn' playing in the background from the V for Vendetta OST. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"0:08 puts cup down, next clip, cup in hand?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,That Sound Track though
zSWdZVtXT7E,"There are some people watched it people the release, and said it's the best Nolan film so far. Not sure is it true, because woww, he has made a lot of great films, if you say best one so far... who knows what's on my mind after actually watching it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,so hyped!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Will be seeing this for sure!
zSWdZVtXT7E,please someone tell me is it possible for intersellar traveling?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool thing about this movie is that it will have to happen at some point in human history
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What did Mathew mcconaheigh say sorry I don't know how to spell his name say ""it's an Indian surveillance drone solar ?????"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""this is the mission you were trained for""
""I've got kids professor""
""get up there and save them""

nothing stops old professor :)

can't wait for this film"
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that a black hole at the end of the trailer or a worm hole? (forgive me if those things are the same)
zSWdZVtXT7E,one of the best trailers I've seen
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer literally makes me tear up. This whole movie is going to be absolutely beautiful and will win so many awards!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Comes out on my bday :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This actually doesn't look nearly as complex as Inception but still, it looks emotional and visually appealing"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Remember..remember, the fifth of November?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've watched this trailer over and over and over again - can't wait for this film to come out!
zSWdZVtXT7E,How do I get the music from this?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think this is either going to be really good or really bad
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm really looking forward to this movie, but I have to say as a German I'm glad that we dub movies. I can't understand a thing McConaughey says in this trailer. It's all mumbling. Even worse when he plays next to someone like Michael Caine who has this crystal clear pronunciation."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Excellent, kudos to christopher nolan. He s a real visionary
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan + Hanz Zimmer + Matthew McConaughey
I SURRENDER COMPLETELY."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Whats the name of the song?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Inception Meets Gravity .
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's the name of that song? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,The background music reminds me of V for Vendetta...rain sequence especially...wonder if its the same composer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm positive Hans Zimmer copied this music from Dario Marianelli's ""Evey Reborn"" (From V for Vendetta) or the two artists have extremely similar taste. This music is...exact. I don't see how this was created originally by Hans Zimmer. Don't just take my word for it, listen for yourself! You'll begin to hear it 45 seconds in. Compare these two scores and you'll understand.  V for Vendetta Soundtrack - Evey Reborn"
zSWdZVtXT7E,its weird that nolan invents some really futuristic invention that will be possible maybe in 100-500 years but yet the fashion of the world remains exactly the same.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music from V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it bad I want IMAX audio headphones I think music or movies you watch on your phone would sound way better with IMAX 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think this could be another milestone in movie history 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The level of entertainment and blockbusters are @ definitively low level this last years in the benelux and beyond, I wonder why,."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks good, but also kinda looks like a recycled armageddon: working class engineer from south usa gets sent into space to save humanity, and more importantly his kids? I get the feeling that out lead character here is going to have to make a big sacrifice at some point. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I thought Christian Bale would have been better but yeah McConaughey is best in his own way.
waiting....."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am not sure I want to watch a Michael Bay movie made by Christopher Nolan.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For all the idiots that are saying 'Intersteller will be the next 2001' - You're wrong.
This is just a guess but I have a strong feeling it's going to be more of a combination of a mainstream action blockbuster like 'Armageddon' & the scifi arthouse mindfuck 'Solaris'."
zSWdZVtXT7E,is this music from V for Vendetta? It's sounds very similar
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks like its going to be awsome.  btw that guy is the same actor that played bruce waynes dad.  if not it sure looks like him
zSWdZVtXT7E,my legs were shivering with goosebumps from this AWESOMENESS !!!!! im a science student at university and sci-fi / intellectual movies like this based on real theories are outstanding and do some good and justice to our dwindling culture
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone else recognize the song ""Evey Reborn"" from V for Vendetta playing in the background?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This song is from the V For Vendetta Soundtrack. Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli.
V For Vendetta Soundtrack - 08 - Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli
I dont understand why you would re-use the music from old soundtracks.. The godzilla trailer re-used a song from space odyssey, the monolyth song. it just sounds off when they clearly belong to another movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E, Christopher Nolan is brilliant. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow
zSWdZVtXT7E,Man I really really really hope this doesn't suck
zSWdZVtXT7E,This better not be in 3D
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks sooooo good I jus hope its totally different from gravity
zSWdZVtXT7E,"McConaughey's character leave earth and dies, children grow up to be Batman and Batgirl."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have seen all the movies made by Nolan.
Insomnia, Memento, Inception, Dark Knight, Prestige and others.
All his movies have these cerebral approach, either real or imaginative. He displays it in a very appreciative & convincing way.
I am a huge fan of his movies and I am waiting eagerly for this one, while wondering what is going to be the twist in the tale !!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,what is the name of the music backround?? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Kerbals say this is possible.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't remember the last time I looked this forward to a movie coming out!  Jessica Chastain plays the daughter (Murphy) as an older woman, and per IMd, there is a 3rd person cast who plays the daughter as an elderly woman.  So I'm thinking Matthew Mcconaughey's character (Coop) does come back, but will not have aged, but everyone on earth has, per Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  I like that John Lithgow is in it too.  He's the one who catches Murphy as she runs outside begging her Dad not to go.  November 7th can't get here fast enough!  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I thought that this trailer would ignite some good intellectual discussion, instead I see the typically banal gibberish that has become the standard fare of the 'YouTube intellect'. With that being said, I hope Nolan finds a way to introduce the concept of Wormholes in a way that is at least somewhat scientifically plausible. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,might be an interesthing movie :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,And here come the religious folks and how god is gonna blah blah blah. But I suppose everyone should be able to say what they want. Fuck it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,YAWN..chris nolan .inception? What a dull movie..batman? Not as dull but no great vision..makin the batman o so grown up and realistic give me bum ache..interstella trailer .crikey who do they make these films for? Themselves methinks cause it sure dosnt look intrestin scfi .more like crappy drawn out melodrama for men in suits who were never fans of scfi anyway..go away chris nolan
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alright alright alright
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is my idol till today and he never fails in making a good movie. Interstellar is gonna be a spectacular movie and probability of getting nominated for oscars is high. Can't wait for the movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks so good. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey is the hero earth deserves .. but not the one it needs right now ..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The concept of spirit comes from self preservation, because man wants to live forever, no one wants to accept reality that everything is mechanical and the things called spirit is nothing but energy, there is no such thing as personal soul, our bodies are form from multiple sources, the personality is patterns in our brains"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Am I crazy, or does Matthew McConaughey look like John Turturro in certain angles and lights? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"@manofknowledge1000 

You may stay here and die. I'm going to space. Get my own planet with hookers and blackjack. You know what ? Forget the blackjack, and the planet. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Mankind was born on earth.
It was never meant to die here."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan has been my second Best director next to Tarantino but as what i admire him most....this one doesn't look as interesting as his normally great films..used to be. Kinda feels like another "" Gravity "" movie coming this year : /"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Who wants to bet Jessica Chastain is his daughter from the future?
zSWdZVtXT7E,HANS ZIMMER BABY
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have a short poem relevant to this...

If every time is true
and life is of value
then surely it's our duty
to coat the universe in splooge"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Another blast from the master, Chris nolan 💃💃"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Please don't be PG13, please don't be PG13..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like a Saturn V...
zSWdZVtXT7E,evey reborn
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan 
One of the BEST directors of Hollywood"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why is he orange? They didn't explain that.
zSWdZVtXT7E,They needed Morgan freeman in this movie!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,that music was played in V for Vendetta when evey goes in the rain.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Chiils
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If it's from Christopher Nolan, I'm sure it will be great."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Interstellar travel is they key, the 1st world nations must increase the budget to their space programs, we must confront the reality of interstellar travel as the only way to secure the permanent existence of the human race, cant you understand ?, we have so much potential in our minds, we could conquer entire solar systems, and most important, we could colonize planets inside the habitable zones, of course the distances are mind-blowing, but that is just the beginning of our journey, we must reach far beyond !"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This music gives me chills!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan, Caine, and McConaughey...what a team."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"2:04
Warp Drive!!!
I am looking forward to see this movie. I hope it does not go off of total fiction and uses some laws of the universe.
I am also guessing that the main character will come back more than 1,000 years later, because space and time is weird like that.
Its like Gravity-hype all over again!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wonder what will happen to our world if we could do this. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,My Cocaine
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Evey Reborn""  Gave the chills in V for Vendetta"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie is gonna score so many Oscars. Best Picture , Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, Best Original Music, Best Sound Editing. and another nomination for Matthew McConaughey for Best leading actor."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The world shall always need an Engineer ;-)
zSWdZVtXT7E,mhhh all eyes will be on the lookout for it comes out! I'm interested to see how it works out!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is one of the few people in this industry that doesnt have his head stuck in his ass. Gotta watch this for sure!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks great. Really shows how far visual effects has evolved. Like the movie Gravity, the outer space has made a great turn back to the movies. I remember reading in the film-history books about the fascination with ""space"" in the 50-60s (I think .s). Also seeing all the, some great, movies about outer space.  
Looks like some of the big directors, like the Wachowskis, Curaón, Nolan and even Marvel gives in. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This gave me shivers, just the sort of movie I've been waiting for"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is a genius!  Also does anyone know the name of the song playing during the trailer?  I'm assuming it's hans zimmer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan We Trust  
zSWdZVtXT7E,Great trailer with a really nice score. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,ran out of food because the powerstructure the anglo american elite willed it that way...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Darude - Sandstorm
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If anyone is curious, the music used in this trailer was taken from the score of 'V for Vendetta'."
zSWdZVtXT7E,even if this movie is bad ( which is not ) i'm going to love it just because of christo the best director ever. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,trash.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Even though I really like the look of this upcoming movie and the idea, I still find it a bit odd.... it is a lot cheaper to replant trees and in 20-50 years the dust storms will be over, they occur because of deforestation, its a lot cheaper than migrating to another planet..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Im all for a space film, except Gravity that was pure crap."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Want to see. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for  Vendettas music! copy pasted!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Holy shit that trailer was Amazing Christopher Nolan is by far my favourite, this trailer was emotional building up to the end"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Doesn't murphy's law mean that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I feel bad for those in Hollywood with McConaughey taking all the good roles. This guy has truly evolved from someone whos just known for, ""alright, alright, alright..."" He's a great actor now, and I can't wait to see this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hello Warp Drive =]
zSWdZVtXT7E,as soon as i saw syncopy….i knew this was another christopher nolan movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,If You've Seen Inception Or Memento Boy You Are In For A Show With This Movie ..
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just heard this for the first time . So can anyone tell me the story plot 
zSWdZVtXT7E,The expansion of human race will beginn with a colonization of nearly planets in our solaire systeme. And than we can continue our expansion in far planets. There is enough energie in the space who waits only for exploitation. Humans can today engineering durable machines and essential products for life. We need just energy but the rest we find in the space. The colonization beginns now but she will not stop in 500.000 years. The beginn of this age is the end of our economic system because material properity is no more importend. We can recover a lot of plantes and animals before human have destroy this planet. It s a hard work but is possible. Nobody is under compulsion for this work the base called voluntary. We cannot continue our former life and perhaps we cannot live alltimes in exoplanets surface but we can live in orbits of planets.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I was like...NOOOOOLAAAAAAAAAN! i need a tissue.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So there is a shortage of food..!!! Grow your own folks...
zSWdZVtXT7E,cant wait!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Much anticipated movie for intergalactic fan like me!! Im really really watch this movie....
zSWdZVtXT7E,i hope the whole movies does not take place on the farm.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its like Apollo 13 meets Gattaca
zSWdZVtXT7E,Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli .... great
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks awesome, I hope batman shows up, then he wakes up and realizes he was just dreaming."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Man. This trailer is truly haunting. I got a chill up and down my spine when the music climaxed, all over my body I broke out in goosebumps, my eyes rolled back into my head and I slowly, without a sound, jizzed onto my printed out picture of Christopher Nolan, dick in hand. He is truly a God among mortals.﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So a movie about humanity going to die and then they need to find another planet to live on so they can ruin that one as well. Instead of focusing on the core issues they just focus on the quick solutions.

Oh God, that is hollywood for you, any more complicated movie would not sell well I guess"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want this! NOW!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"why does this have the soundtrack from ""V for Vendetta""?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like how they really worked on making the movie scientifically realistic.A wormhole bends time and space and on the last seconds of the trailer the spacecraft ""opens"" a wormhole and you can see how space bends around them as if they are inside a sphere.Really hope it turns out great!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don´t wanna close my eeeeeyes... I don´t wanna fall asleep ´coz I´d miss you, babe... and I don´t wanna miss a thiiiiiiiing..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hope, love, emptiness, forgiveness, memories, nightmares, hope, time, space, events, reunite.

A pack a tissues is required for this film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nice to see an actual sci-fi movie being made (ie one where the plot wouldn't work just as well shoved into another genre)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this not the music from V for Vendetta when she runs out into the rain?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Too early to judge but hope Nolan lives upto his name. As for the comments below
The following -  Not so good movie but good screenplay
Memento - Mindboggling. Credits to Nolan brothers.!!
The prestige - one of the hallmark films in Hollywood. Nolan brothers does it again
Batman Begins - the trendsetter showing the pain and personal life issues of Superheroes. U never saw that in any movie before. Lol
Dark knight - one word...JOKER..everyone loved it for the evil mind of a criminal designed by Nolan of course. Plus the plot.!!
Dark Knight rises - Good film as a whole. Didn't make an impact probably coz of the hype set by its predecessor
The Inception - In my opinion the second best movie by Nolan. And Leonardo ..Just wow.!!
Interstellar -  ????"
zSWdZVtXT7E,WOOOO awesome looking trailer! cant wait :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,It will be a new 2001: A space odyssey 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just mention 'India'.....nd the movie turns into a Blockbuster! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,All I can say is.. V for Vendetta.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,My sci-fi sense is tingling!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it November yet?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Se ve excelente
zSWdZVtXT7E,Really? Anne Hathaway as an astronaut?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"From the way the movie is made, I feel like Batman is gona show up."
zSWdZVtXT7E,to bad the that the intersteller beings living underground and working with our goverment do not step in even if the scenario would occur. We are in an ant farmj
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love space movies, this looks good."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Astronaut farmer 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Get out there and save them, start today."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Aliens man all i'm gonna say! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have so much hype for this movie, i just hope they can deliver it!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Booooooooooooo!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,LAME
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone know the name of the song that plays in the background of this trailer?? Thanks in advance!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Went to see Godzilla and this trailer played and the whole theater applauded to the trailer, I've never experienced such a thing "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow. Tears.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""we didnt run out of planes and televisonsets, we ran out of food"" + ""we must think not as individuals, but as a species"" + McConaugheys cryface = BEST TRAILER EVER! #wemustconfronttherealityofinterstellartravle"
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's like a day behind the camera is like a day at the office for Christopher Nolan; the only Nolan film I've seen that was in my opinion any good was Insomnia (the way I remember it at least) but this trailer of Interstellar seems promising.
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack!
zSWdZVtXT7E,SICK.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Never been hyped for a movie like this before
zSWdZVtXT7E,the third trailer is epic and just makes this one look like another teaser lol    
zSWdZVtXT7E,God damn you Nolan why don't you just take my wallet and be done with it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,That's the poem from matched
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Great cast, interesting concept, and Hans Zimmer...I'm sold. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Honestly i am just going to watch this movie because it was written and directed by Mr. Nolan and that is a garantee of a good great awesome fantastic master piece
zSWdZVtXT7E,Honestly i am just going to watch this movie because it was written and directed by Mr. Nolan and that is a garantee of a good great awesome fantastic master piece
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan is my favorite director, after seeing the dark knight, inception (both in my top five favorite movies) and the prestige (in my top 10 favorite), I can't wait to see this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Btw *SPOILER? Jessica Chastain is the Murphy kid all grown up. Her dad will probably do a time loop thingy (after he gets 'lost' in a black hole or something) and they'll be reunited. At least it looks sorta like that.
zSWdZVtXT7E,what an indian drone doing there
zSWdZVtXT7E,So does he come back? dosen't seem like it...
zSWdZVtXT7E,What music is this?
zSWdZVtXT7E,The trailer music is from the film V for Vendetta hahaha! But it makes the trailer so epicccc!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well it is Christopher Nolan, so it's either going to be really cool OR the most boring theater experience ever."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer is awesome! I am like watching a movie already. Haha..
zSWdZVtXT7E,so the plot twist is its about time travel
zSWdZVtXT7E,This one trailer is 100 times better than all 4 Transformers movies put together 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Seems a lot like the 2007's, Sunshine. Just an observation."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that Anne Hathaway!?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music in this trailer is from V for vendetta and I fucking love that film (one of my favourite comic book movies ever, its so powerful). Anyway this film look$ like its goanna be great I cant wate."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the trailer released for interstellar today has not let me down, I pray that this film will be as good as the trailers have been"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"1; it sounds really preachy, and 2; it looks an awful lot like Contact. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,They need more Agricultural  Engineers! Problem solved!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yes, i believe ill be watching this."
zSWdZVtXT7E,shivers multiple times
zSWdZVtXT7E,spoiler alert; they go though the black hole and find me and die.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Another dumb movie with mind blowing visual effects which forces fan boys to not use their minds.

Coz everybody will loses their minds. USE IT."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love the fact that all you real life Sheldon's. are engaging in a pointless & futile overblown argument. But I'm just here to gawp at Anne Hathaway :). 
zSWdZVtXT7E,we should already be conducting manned missions to mars and planning to do the same with asteroids. instead we have barely explored our own solar system. you can thank centuries of inquisitions and religious bloodletting for that
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yeah, a couple of hours of exposition so the transformers fans can understand it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm disappointed to know that the score in this trailer isn't the original music for the Interstellar movie. It's track from V for Vendetta. Too bad, I think this is actually perfect and fits to the movie. :("
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks overblown. And typically Hollywood. Why would a man leave his children behind. To go on a certain death mission. Even though his kids appear to have no mother?. Whatever, wonder if Hathaway gets her boobs out again :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,That music ^_^
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Seeing the trailer, I am now sure that it will win Oscar for sure.... ;)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"They still portray mankind as having dinosaur old coal powered space crap.. i mean space craft.The current technology that is NOT made public, is light years ahead of this mumbo jumbo.Only in the movies people."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan + Scifi + Heartbreaking Drama ... YES PLEASE! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I CAN NOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Masterpieces
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan and Matthew McConaughey.. yup, its gonna be good!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When a movie trailer shows the plot, people complain that it's ruined the movie.

When a movie trailer is ambiguous about the plot, people complain that it didn't show the plot.

WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU, INTERNET?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer has gotten me really excited for the movie.And for those who are already trying to convince us that we are about to watch a mediocre and shallow movie:Try to write a movie script or even come up with a movie idea.Imo,the job that these guys do is extremely unappreciated and I can see that here in the Utube comment section we have a lot of keyboard crusaders.Bash this movie trailer all you want,I am not tellin anyone to like or praise the movie,just don't hate it just by the movie trailer and don't just downgrade the guys job at WB. Good day y'all!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,to take  of the  milky way u need 1000's + light years 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well this looks good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"....Then he puts it on dash board, then it's in his hand again!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Why would you release a trailer where one second a mug is in his left hand then no mug and left hand on steering wheel, then a mug again! HA! Great editing!! Sure the film will be good however!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Micheal Caine has become a terrible actor, he picks the same boring roles over and over. Matthew Mcconaughey cant put a foot wrong at the minute though, establishing himself as world class."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Look crapply cheesy. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'll make sure it does die here...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Recycled music!!!! ""Evey Reborn"" from ""V for Vendetta"". Don't use it for any other scene :("
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack. Just waiting for V to scream with fire in the background!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Plot twist: He's not coming back
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Did he just say ""Murica, I love you""??? LOL this movie will be boss"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Hey Coop, here's your backstory and some plot exposition for the dumb audience: you're a pilot and a genius and our society is out of food. Ok GO!"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've never anticipated a movie so much
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm sure Nolan making another ""you decide the ending"" type of movie. All the weird and mind confusing scenes that lead to an ending where maybe it all was just a dream of these astronauts hibernating in the spaceship lost somewhere in outer space.  The End"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yeah! Let's get out there and destroy that planet too!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Tbh I'd rather the trailer not reveal what happens after they enter the wormhole, than reveal it. It makes it more intriguing, and leaves more to the mind. A lot of trailers seem to lay out the entire plot of a movie before people even see it, which results in predictable guesses of how it will end, which you don't want for a movie like this."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks amazing, can't wait!
PS: that music totally reminds me of V for Vendetta"
zSWdZVtXT7E,New trailers interstellar 3 http://www.interstellarmovie.com/index-intl.php password 7201969
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Let's hope Nolan doesn't end up accidentally breaking too many scientific laws. But then again, there's always sound effects in every outer space film..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So...they run out of food. Decision: Go to space!! Yeah, sorry, but you're not going to find a solution out there, unless this is some colonize another planet type thing. I really hope the plot of this movie is not that dumb. At least make it plausible to a degree."
zSWdZVtXT7E,sphere 2!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm pretty sure he's not coming back until at least the third or fourth movie.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,McConaughey will always be Rust to me
zSWdZVtXT7E,yessssssssssss
zSWdZVtXT7E,among all soundtracks...they use V for Vendetta's :(
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I want to see some aliens, other galaxies, other planets."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sci-Fi aren't my cup of tea but only because of Nolan, I will give this one a shot...
Nothing will top "" The Dark Knight "" though..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well this doesn't look good or anything.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks amazing. I'm expecting an emotional roller coaster and I expect to be crying. hit me with all the feels Mr. Nolan!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another boring family play masked as sci-fi. The indie movies coming out at the moment are so much better than this Hollywood crap.
zSWdZVtXT7E,WHERES THE BATMAN?!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alfred?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't believe i read comments of people actually insulting the idea of space travel or really any research into it. Science can overcome any challenge and explain anything, its simply a matter of time and like religion, it does require faith but instead of faith in god its faith in humanity."
zSWdZVtXT7E,That worm hole looks so creepy and un nerving
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its a space warp drive they are driving
zSWdZVtXT7E,pls pls bring it to me
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like this movie is gonna be....outta this world. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music is from V for Vendetta :D 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Do not look this movie up on Imdb. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks great, definetly will watch"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Finally a new movie that poses the fact that exploration into the unkown is both exhilerating and terrifying, and that true change requires sacrifice. This may scare some people to change their outlooks on having a future."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love space movies, many of them are enthralling; I ardently respect all those astronauts who go to space and carry out experiments aboard the ISS. But, as a resident of this planet, I would love it if humanity would be less cruel to nature, and help maintain the balance of our ecosystem, by reducing pollution, violence, killing of animals. I am sure that no one will ever migrate to any other planet(Mars being the only option), because our body does not suit their atmosphere-if anyone goes on interplanetary travel, I am sure it will be a 1 way trip, and the whole world's population will never go, except astronauts & crazy billionaires. The Earth has life for a reason, no other planet has that, and we should be grateful for that. Wormholes are still a theory, but, if it is found to exist, interstellar travel will be carried out by astronauts only; 7 billion(who knows, 14 billion in the future) will never go and colonize on Alpha Beta whatever new planet that's discovered; we shall perish anyway due to geological events, maybe a massive earthquake, too much pollution, poisonous radiation from space etc. So, my point is, space travel should only be in fiction, novels and movies, and whatever NASA is doing, at least for now. It would be much useful for Earth & humanity's survival, if we concentrate on eradicating diseases, inventing a cure for all incurable diseases, reducing pollution of air/water/sound/land/electronic waste/radioactive waste etc., finding alternate ways of harnessing pollution free energy, letting animals live, and reducing violence, and lastly, doing all the mentioned work on a major scale(not like, only 20 cars run on electricity and the rest use gas) because, if the Earth survives, we do too-and the longer we live, the longer we can experiment on space travel. But Earth is our home and foundation, and we must not forget that."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Capricorn conspiracies all over again
zSWdZVtXT7E,This film doesn't look good to me. I'll pass...
zSWdZVtXT7E,IF BATMAN IS ON A SPACESHIP WHERE IS THE JOKER???????
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For all of you who are wondering, the track used is evey reborn - dario marianelli. If you enjoy the track I highly recommend watching the actual move it was used in v for vendetta, the track was used so perfectly in it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music by Hans Zimmer. Holy hell the soundtrack is going to be immense! Even if the trailer music was ""Evey Reborn"" by Marianelli."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Do you think this film's story will be similar to that of Contact, Solaris, or 2001, suggesting what's out there is some spectrum of what our human mind/brain/spirit is already made up of? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Why does this remember me of Contact? Oh, right, there's a believer Matthew McConaughey in it ;)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks incredible. It may comment here and there about the use of non-reusable fuel sources (e.g. coal, gasoline, etc.), but seems like it'll be geared, mostly, towards space exploration. I think the trailer might be 90% plot exposition, 10% actual movie.

In other words, I think (and hope) that most of the trailer is only the beginning of the film, and when they go through the Wormhole is when everything really kicks off. 

Then again, who knows; I could be totally wrong. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its amazing how Christopher Nolan turns a sci-fi movie into a dark intense thrilling drama and with Matthew McCounaghey the acting becomes super awesome !! Best director of the 21st century !!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anne Hathaway...no thanks.
zSWdZVtXT7E,allright allright
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Its worth of the movie to be the most anticipated movie of 2014 as the special effect is outstanding and the plot is also well-created as well to warn every human to stop any activites that polluts our environment in order to prevent motherearth from being destroyed and prevent the greenhouse effect that will harm every single human, thats why you should watch interstellar. Other than that, the sound effect is extraordinarily amazing and theme song is also very suitable to the movie and have the mighty power to persuade peope to watch it"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"driver puts coffee cup to the dashboard with his right hand then it's on his left hand again on the next shot @ 0:11

zSWdZVtXT7E,"We can't even take care of our own planet to preserve its ecosphere, so pack up and move somewhere new and start the process over again.. Silly..Silly humans. ﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks like a great movie :)))
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well my brain exploded. But I will still go see the movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So he goes into space then she follows him when she grows up? She was in a suit but older 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Please let this be better than TDKR.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the comments left really annoy me. people complaining about not know what the plot is from the trailer ? no shit you fucking idiots, it's a fucking Nolan movie. he intentionally does that. We also have morons complaining about it being 'another' sci-fi movie, if this movie is too much for you to comprehend, go watch the Expendables."
zSWdZVtXT7E,He ain't coming back
zSWdZVtXT7E,that song from V from Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks to be good movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks to be good movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks TOO freaking good! Can't wait to see it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"From the the looks of the trailer I think the method of travel that is use in the film is not a worm hole but a Kerr Ring-- its basically stable rotating black hole.For technical physic explanation just google it,Okay?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks very awesome...gave me gooseys
zSWdZVtXT7E,I stop the porn to see this ... Great movie!
zSWdZVtXT7E,CN't WA'T 4 DIS
zSWdZVtXT7E,The most perfect trailer ever. It doesn't show too much but what you to see more.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dat music tho!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music V for Vendetta, release movie 5 november, coincidence."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Great... now humans can go poop on other planets.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"ok people i didnt like dkr that much either, but the prestige, memento, inception, bat 1 and 2, are all 8.5 to 10, thats a pretty impresive record for good movies, i believe he wants to do this, and a story about a black hole could be fucking incredible dont know why hasnt been done yet, its a cool potenially filled with human-existence-in-the-universe concept, in nolan i trust til the end of time, or is it space?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alcubierre drive
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's this song? And why is it sounding so familiar?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"that song, i could've sworn i heard it in another movie..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Something really tells me that this movie will end with them about to go through the wormhole, and then there will a sequel, and we'll have to wait another 2-3 or so."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Star Trek First Contact without the Enterprise from the future?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just take my money already. Take it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,did he just warp on a grav lens?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"THIS is how you do a trailer. This makes me wanna go into the theater and find out where the hell Mathew McConahickie is going, I wanna know what's gonna happen but see, I can only find that shit out by watching the movie. THIS is how a trailer should be done, giving us basically what seems to be tidbits of the first fourth of the movie rather than give us the whole plot right away along with 10,000 clips (looking at you Amazing Spider-man 2). Shit like this gets me pumped af."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't think that this looks any good, but Nolan has not failed yet."
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is why I love movies
zSWdZVtXT7E,"if you have read the script of 2008 version, this trailer only shows first 25 minutes of the film. This film offers much more, trust me guys. There is more than what meets the eye. Also, Matt Damon is in the film for short period of time. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn are all playing the same character over decades implying the crew will be gone for at least 50 years. 

Hope that they do return? However Christopher Nolan has implied there will be time travel of some form. Very curious to how it all plays out."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"who is the young guy at the 13 second mark, he looks familiar but can't place him"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i like all of nolan's films but idk about this one, it just doesn't seem like anything special "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks good. I hope 90% of the movie doesn't take place on earth.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Man I'm actually pretty stoked for this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is another movie I feel will be very special to me, it gives me goosebumps, exactly like the Christopher Nolan films before this one."
zSWdZVtXT7E,New trailer aired at COMIC-CON!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Holy shit, completely forgot this was dropping this year. Well, I know what I'm doing in November."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Its Evey Reborn, people!!! Its by Dario Marionelli! And its from V for Vendetta!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It took me a while to figure out why the background music sounded so familiar. It was composed by Hans Zimmer for the V for Vendetta soundtrack- ""Evey Reborn"". Didn't think Zimmer would use it twice..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Cannot wait for this, Nolan is one of the greatest of all time. Nothing he has ever put out disappointed."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"How about all those seeds of every plant and food , seed collected on this planet  in the Swiss alps locked up in the mountains 2 miles underground in an event of a catastrophic disaster. we can grow food again; well flying a spaceship into a wormhole is much more exiting than taking an united airlines trip to Switzerland an bringing it back to Nebraska. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Eve Reborn
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goosebumps every time.
zSWdZVtXT7E,resembles war of the worlds
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We are off to outer space
to save the human race...
Leaving all we known behind
for cure we hope to find..."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have some really high expectations for this film.....The trailer is mind blowing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love how Nolan only fits a little in this trailer. How all the food is gone and we have to search for new planets to settle on by traveling through a wormhole. The trailer never shows what happens after. I'm willing to bet theres gonna be some mind-blowing shit happening when they go through the wormhole. This Movie is going to be awesome!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Save us Russ!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"climate change is real, its natural. not man made like you are led to believe."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's the song? I've heard it on top gear before
zSWdZVtXT7E,Only one trailer and one teaser released about the film but I'm convinced it's going to be the best film this year
zSWdZVtXT7E,Contact 2 lol jk
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wonder if Jodie Foster makes a cameo in this film :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,A group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage. -- IMDb Plot: Interstellar (2014)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"please interstellar, don't suck like transcendance did."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone have a problem with Mcconaughey driving an old beat up chevy but the movie has wormhole/lightspeed technology :s
zSWdZVtXT7E,Eventually if the human race survives long enough we will run out of all other alternative solutions to the Earths problems and we'll be left with only two options....Interstellar travel or the end of our species. Humanity will have to confront this problem far sooner than anyone expects
zSWdZVtXT7E,A Christopher Nolan film is always fitting when Michael Caine is in it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Why would a father find it a compelling argument to leave his kids on trip that would most certainly stretch beyond their life time.  If the argument is humanity needs to leave earth, to where ?  A few guys popping through a hole will hardly alleviate population issues. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:53 Is that Ann Hathaway?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For some reason I have a feeling this is going to be Nolan's magnum opus. His masterpiece. His E.T, his A Clockwork Orange, his Star Wars, his Lord Of The Rings. Yes I know there is The Dark Knight but I have a feeling this movie will be groundbreaking."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I've been trying to make out what Coop says at the very start for months now. Does anyone else know? ""hehwheaddah-fly?"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really hope this film isn't in 3D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This feels like Nolan trying to claw his way back to the top of Hollywood's critically acclaimed. He takes a years break, during which McConaughey's career hits another stride and Gravity is a massive hit."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow dying to watch this movie something resembles to time machine and as it's CN it cant be non interesting 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm very excited for this movie, probably will be great, but I think it would be more believable if the setting was centered around the greenhouse effect with all the carbon we are releasing these days, making the earths atmosphere into a boiling pot... Unless we ban production of gas and diesel driven vehicles and power plants, the ""invisible death"" isn't too far away for our civilization =/
Hell, the first victims of our greed might already have been born =("
zSWdZVtXT7E,"and this, is the movie that we are waiting for"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The song used in this trailer is,""Evey Reborn"" from V for Vendetta. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Epic trailer, I expect an epic movie Mr. Nolan!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If you use basic common sense they send a ship out to an already earth like planet..but on that ship will be some kind of matter transmitter so that they can transport the rest of humanity off our resource stripped earth..obviously we can't all fit in one spaceship no matter how big..the only way to travel from earth to the nearest habitable planet would be through that old staple of SF the portal or jumpgate..I'm guessing all this...but in most movie trailers its pretty easy to fill in the gaps....that's not to say that Mr Nolan won't do a great job of it and maybe we'll even get a couple of twists in there too..at least he tries to imbue his movies with slightly more intelligence than the SF clones that pass themselves off as entertainment these days...it'll be interesting for example ..the time delay between leaving earth and landing on the new home..is everybody back home still alive or have they left it too late?..I'm relying on Mr Nolan not to go cute and bring that sense of dark cynicism to this movie...cheers Prof Hugo Nebula PhD.

"
zSWdZVtXT7E,you can't go wrong with Christopher Nolan
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't exactly know why this trailer makes me cry. I know I am saddened by war, world hunger, political corruption, and social injustice; our current social ills, hollow innovations, mindless celebrity worship, superficial ambitions, and social superiority. Perhaps this trailer makes me believe that humanity is still destined for things greater than those which so morbidly depress me. Perhaps it makes me believe that the age of discovery is not over, that the true spark of innovation still exists somewhere, that there's still a sense of wonder to relished in our efforts. Perhaps this why i cry, out of hope."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This could be the best film of the year. Got goosebumps just watching the trailer!
zSWdZVtXT7E,V For Vendetta soundtrack. I'm not mad at it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Been waiting for this movie a long time, I seriously hope Chris Nolan can blow my mind once again like he did in Inception and Memento "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wish a situation like this happen so that whoever watching justin beibar music videos should know what reality is.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Rust
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan is just a bad-ass contemporary film-maker! This film is mostly shot with a so-called 70 mm camera, or bigger than that. The fact that this director brings forth such great depictions within his movies are fun and exciting to watch, and better yet the stories make his films build up to what makes a movie almost come to life when you are watching it; Prestige, Inception, Memento, and Nolan's adventure through Detective Comics. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,y'all come back now y'hear?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Imaging him, coming back to earth where everything changed in 1000 years.. And he only aged a few months because oft the interstellar speed.. It could develop into a Drama minding relativation theorie and co..

zSWdZVtXT7E,My most anticipated film of 2014!!!! This has movie has a 99.9% chance being successful =D

zSWdZVtXT7E,hans zimmer is GODDD
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is a genius
zSWdZVtXT7E,Would'nt be suprised if this sweeps the oscars.

zSWdZVtXT7E,"The score is identical to the ""God is in the rain"" scene from V For Vendetta. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh. My. God.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So, Earth 'ran out of food'??  Well with the worthless toxic GMO's, and the destruction of the bee's, it's a very possible future. Because the global 'elite' (or idiots) think mankind should be reduced to a controlled 500,000 people. That only they should live forever, transferring their 'souls' into machines so they can eventually make those machines more 'human' looking but with endless life spans. People need to turn off the tv and look around, see the chemtrails they spray over head, that gives us all kinds of decease, the toxic GMO crops that sterilize men and women so by their third generation no one or 'other' life form will be able to reproduce. Then they will clone humans, shorten their lifespans and control them under a failed program of socialism, which doesn't work and the human race will disappear by the year 3000. This is the problem with those who think that because they are rich they should control everything. People just want to live in peace, raise a family and provide for them. We don't want endless stupid wars, or pushy governments telling us what we should buy, or do.. We just want to be free..  So, we all need to tell them..  F#$K OFF.. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,yeah...he totally ain't comin' back
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well its hard to guess since this movie is directed by Christopher Nolan, God knows whats inside his brain. Great director. Still infatuated with Inception and Dark Knight til now."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So gravity 2?
zSWdZVtXT7E,BIG like !!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't wait until November.
!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,yes please
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Allri',allri',allri' this will be a good movie XD"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The technology of the space shuttle their in does not correlates with the time period that I've perspective this movie to take place in.
zSWdZVtXT7E,He's not coming back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I lost complete interest in Nolan after dark knight rises. this doesn't look that great either. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,look crap at the moment
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't understand why I almost cried when I saw this trailer in the theater for the first time...
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm going to really hope that it's not too focused on the people on earth but rather the people on the mission and the mission itself
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oscars...Oscars everywhere
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am a genius. I love you all. You all are beautiful people.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like the idea that some filmmakers decide to not give too much plot away. Gives a sence of wonder to it all, rather than being a very easy plot and an ending that is not very original. People love to speculate on the plot, but i dont think people should get angry about it, provide your own opinion...best theing about being an individual is your opinion counts to yourself"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"hopefully this will end the nolan brothers pedantic movie career. i've have yet to see a single movie from them that i didn't figure out in the first 25 minutes. excessive, unnecessary dialogue, details that an imbecile  would get in half of the exposition, lazy stoy telling and piss poor writing and worse directing. if they ever do a Bond movie it will be the most horrific one ever made. i'v seen more talent in first year film students, maybe because nolan never attended a film school. a flash in the pan, flavor of the month type thats on the same level as michael bay and uwe boll."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Seems like a cross between Sunshine and 2001.
Without all the murder"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan is the sponge

zSWdZVtXT7E,goosebumps! Defo gonna watch this :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Eh, Mackenzie Foy is in this one!
Should be good.  She did amazing
work on RL Stein's Haunting Hour..
Johnny Depp, Michael J. Fox, they
both started out on TV too."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I feel like this movie might be a depiction of the events leading up to the launch, then it could simply cut to black when the ship enters the wormhole.
Either day, I'm really excited :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I always need a dictionary for Christopher Nolan's movies..xD
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dude Nolan never disappoints the day he decides to do a predator or star wars remake ill be first in line
zSWdZVtXT7E,Please tell me various scenes have been shot on the IMAX camera. Then much happiness will occur.
zSWdZVtXT7E,is this the soundtrack for V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the script is a good read, i would recommend it highly."
zSWdZVtXT7E,oh....my...............GOD
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So pumped for this one
I see oscars coming also"
zSWdZVtXT7E,You know its a christopher nolan film if it has Cain in it. lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,A Chrstopher Nolan movie with Michael Caine and Hans Zimmer? Who would have guessed.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"FILM OF THE YEAR, have i watched it... nope"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler: He doesn't come back
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ok, for the stupid people out their who don't know what this movie is about, I will tell you: ""When a wormhole is discovered, explorers and scientists unite to embark on a voyage through it, transcending the limits of human space travel."" The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan so it has to be good + I heard it will have similar effects from ""Gravity"" which is another ++. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,OMG. Awesome.
zSWdZVtXT7E,idk it looks boring. hopefully its good tho
zSWdZVtXT7E,i am the only one who gets the feel that this can end up being like 2001 space odyssey?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Now to build that spacecraft in KSP :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hello, Evey"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"finally a movie that takles important questions of humanity including all the challenges of our near future... cannot wait to see it, must be a masterpiece if executed well :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Just for the people like me who love soundtracks, the trailer music is ""Evey Reborn"" by Dario Marianelli from the V for Vendetta OST - obviously not Hans Zimmer, but looking forward to his score for this movie!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another Oscar nomination for McConaughey for sure!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Omg is that renesmee
zSWdZVtXT7E,Will be best of 2014. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just realised that at the end he passes through the event horizon of a black hole. :O
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone know the epic song in this?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Civilization:Beyond Earth trailer lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,08 . Evey Reborn...... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did they go into a black hole in the end? So confused.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It Was a OK trailer.....
but its nolan's movie so the movie's gotta b good
cant wait for it......"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I gotta watch this movie on IMAX, so I can really feel Christopher Nolan magic even more haha, awesome :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The scene of them reaching the edge of the Universe induced such overwhelming joyful emotions, I could hardly hold in the tears. This one is going to be on my mind until it's released."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It will be interesting to see how Nolan handles what appears to be a HUMAN story, being as humanity is arguably his weakness as a filmmaker in my opinion. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wait was that a black hole because if it was that spaceship was suppose to be ripped apart into tiny atoms
zSWdZVtXT7E,"At a guess, McConnaughty's character leaves his kids on doomed earth behind to set off and save the future of human race. When he returns, time has not passed for him as fast as it did on earth and his ginger daughter is grown up ( Chastain) , she somehow end up dying before him and he realises the whole thing was pointless we all die anyway and he should have spent time with his kids when he had the chance."
zSWdZVtXT7E,omg where can i get his jacket?!?! its fabulous!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For those of you who have not read the leaked script online, I'll say that this trailer shows only the start of the movie. The wormhole is only the beginning."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The most crazy part is, is that over population can lead to no food."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So if we cant fix our home, we send out a team to other places in order to work out a deal?

This is not progress. Desperation will lead to greed and then war. We are simply repeating the same mistakes (our history is proof) because it is human nature. Animals that think.

Yes I am excited and have high expectations to this story. The trailer gives this negative vibe though. Not like Star Trek where we just wanna get out and find friends."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Front row seats for this boyZ!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer + Christopher Nolan = perfection
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait until this movie comes out in November. I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's work.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie is just amazing and this one film makes mw pursue my dream of becoming astronaut and explore the universe. Im very intrigued by the Alcubierre Drive.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan + Hans Zimmer + Space = I CAAAAAAAAN'T WAAAAIIIITT !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone know the name of the song, or a link to it?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Remember, remember
To watch this movie on November"
zSWdZVtXT7E,If we can colonize the galaxy we will become invincible.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It takes a lot of energy to make a wormhole, just sayin."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"WOW Looks amazing, when will it be released?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Believe in the nolan brothers..they do a great job always
zSWdZVtXT7E,If matthew mcconaughey wins a award for this I really hope he doesn't thank his religious god..... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dont they have plans for a sky ark already?  2 miles in diameter and 15 miles long.  its supposedly able to handle around 200k people and basically relocate humanity.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm about to tell you all something, and if you see this film I am about to mention, you will not be disappointing. It too, is about wormholes and interstellar travel. 

The movie is 'Contact' (1997), the trailers don't do it justice. It is the best film ever made. It will forever be the best sci-fi film. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murph,  his daughter is both a kid and a grown woman. You see both in the trailer. She's wearing Coopers jacket. Perhaps her brother ( the one in the truck) is Casey Affleck's character all grown up. Cooper left and... did not return for a long time. Hmm....I'll check this out when it comes.out."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"good theme, boring realisation"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks really good. On another note NASA hurry up with Orion already!
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is gonna be so epic!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,compared to other Chris Nolan trailers  - this is kinda boring.. perhaps they're not giving anything away too soon
zSWdZVtXT7E,I cant wait to see this :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Soo it looks like he stays in space for most of his children's lifetimes. Jessica Chastain plays his daughter grown up and I believe there is another actress who plays an elderly version of her for when/if he returns. It will be interesting to see how they will have aged while on their journey compared to everyone else.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Love it..  as usual my undying faith on Chris Nolan continues n hopefully ds will not only help strengthen it, but also b a start of amazing line of new original stories dt don't rely on comic book characters"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait for this shit!
zSWdZVtXT7E,:25 Ben Afleck?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"get ready to have your mind blown ala Momento, Prestige, Inception. I think Time Dilation will play a huge role."
zSWdZVtXT7E,boring
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is good must epic movies i cant wait theater please don't hate this it!. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"All of you arguing about the plot...c'mon guys, it's Nolan and after all that he's done I can say that  #InNolanWeTrust  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"2010 - Inception
2014 - Interstellar
2018 - Incest ??? Incubation ??? Inamorata ???"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was expecting a more exciting trailer. IMHO, this is not as good as inception trailer or even dark knight rises trailer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I know they have casted different actors to portray the various ages of McConaughey's children. Makes me pretty sure that some kind of space-time travel will definitely be involved.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""I am coming back"" to his daughter... metaphor¿?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is this a prequel to Mass Effect? 
*joking...if you don't get it. 
*or if you were just being dumb.
*naw kidding i love you.
*ok fuck off"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why are all Christoffer Nolan trailers so good
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want to watch it right NOW!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Even our sun will one day make life on Earth impossible. Humanity must one day leave our solar system. There are some problems on Earth that will need to be resolved between now and then, but that is the final problem."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I've been waiting for a great space exploration movie to come out for quite some time now. DO NOT BREAK MY HEART, PLLLEAAASSSEEE!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan i´ve always trust!!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""but professor, I have kids"". ""get out-zere and zave them"". GRAB, ""no, professor, YOU get out there and save ALL of us, you hero, you"" ""wait, what are you zooing?""
[next shot of rocket lifting off, Cooper with his arm around young Murphy, watching the rocket lift off into space ""there goes a regular hero, that one - want dinner, sweetie ?"" ""sure, daddy"" camera zooms in on smirk on Cooper's face, movie ends, fades to black. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"just out of curiosity, there will be some Interstellar action right?  the trailor only seems to hint at them entering a wormhole. but nothing else, everything is showing on earth. there is more too it right? i hope there just doing a good job trying not to spoil the movie with the trailers. i'd like to see some awesome deep space adventure."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks like the most boring movie ever made! I went into a trailer induced coma after the first 30 seconds! This movie seriously needs a whole lot more boobs and explosions!!! I'll see how I like it after a couple of 25oz Clamato's.......
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:50 So it looks like the solution to interstellar travel was to bolt together a bunch of TARDISes.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this crap trailer was more annoying in the theater than here on youtube.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie is going to be amazing!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Manofknowledge100.....you're an idiot
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sounds like the plot from a stephen baxter novel.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Waiting for November
zSWdZVtXT7E,just come out now!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Saw this trailer in IMAX before Godzilla.  I'd say it was the highlight of the night.  
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anybody know where I can get this song?
zSWdZVtXT7E," Ok, this looks a bit cheesy, but I´m interested in how the plot develops around the wormhole."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yeah Fugayzee Fugahzee, it's a Whoozie it's a Whahzee..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We ran out of food"" --Maybe they should have stopped setting all of the corn fields on fire?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Intergalactic travel common when? Good music, fitting role for him after film Contact with him and Jodie Foster."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So this is Armageddon without the asteroid? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,You had me at Christopher Nolan.
zSWdZVtXT7E,":) Cool to see people so excited by this, but I don't get it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When I saw this I was like ""Ooooooh Ooooooh I wanna watch thaaaat."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that Casey Affleck in the trailer ?? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Did anyone else notice that the soundtrack in this trailer is also used in the movie ""V for vendetta""?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack used. Evey Reborn. Nice touch to the trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Epic!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like the concept of leaving earth and interstellartravel, but with these almost unimaginable vast distances our life span is just a blink of an eye. Finding a planet with the perfect conditions like; The right gravitational pull, amount of H2O, distance to a star/sun, right atoms, age, and so on.. is like finding a needle in the Victoria Lake. Our lives are just too short and there are too many factores that makes earth livable to, that this will ever be realistic. But i like the concept and popcorn :-)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"My god.. What a beautiful soundtrack...! Like Clint Mansell, touches the heart."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer, along with the Cloud Atlas trailer,...is the best I have ever seen. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christ almighty Nolan!! 30 seconds into the TRAILER and we've already got 4th wall breaking expository dialogue. I'm not that stupid that I need the plot explained to me. Enough already.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mankind is capable of greatness. We are an adaptable species. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Gamers who are interested in this movie should know about Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen, so if you don't, look it up!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't understand why people find it hard to believe the reasoning behind us being an interstellar traveling species.  During the existence of the Earth there have been over a handful of mass extinctions caused by different things.  We have the technology and the means to survive some things, but the odds are that we will eventually have to just leave the planet.  

Let's say we find a way to prevent all those things, the sun is not going to last forever.  Perfecting interstellar travel is the only way we can truly survive as a species.  The ability to pick up our things and move to a different location is our only true means of survival, and you wouldn't want it to be the last thing you do before something catastrophic occurs.  Chances are, by then it is too late."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Keep pumping out that good sci-fi stuff whoop whoop 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I got chills watching this. Anything Christopher Nolan does is pure gold. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,at 0:57 he sounds just like Bale's Batman lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks amazing. Contact meets Inception
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Let's face it, he's not coming back..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ran out of food? Probably because Coop is bulldozing them with his truck and they're burning the crops? Idk...just me. lol Can't wait to see this movie!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've lost count of how many times I've watched this trailer... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is a IMAX must, the director loves to shoot scenes with IMAX cameras"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yo that guy is always in Christopher Nolan's movies lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,god is in the rain
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love good sci-fi movies and this looks promising
zSWdZVtXT7E,amazing how a 2min trailer can be so powerful
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity unfortunately didn't win best picture. Fingers crossed Interstellar wins best picture this year. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gives me GoosePimples looks like it will be a great Movie interesting and thought provoking on Mankinds continued evolution.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"cripes, that's a damn good trailer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,One of the best movie trailers I've ever seen. Highly looking forward to this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The main ideal of this movie was rediculous, running out of food? hopeless Earth so just leaving for helping? Is this purpose of NASA for getting more fund to developing unncessary project? If earth really running out of food, it's China and India's problem."
zSWdZVtXT7E,cant wait
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music, it's from V for Vendetta! This is getting more awesome each time."
zSWdZVtXT7E,when can i buy this game and is it better than gta 5??
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan, thanks in advance"
zSWdZVtXT7E,does micheal caine play in every christopher nolan movie for gods sake?
zSWdZVtXT7E,someone has been playing a lot of eve online haaa
zSWdZVtXT7E,drew swift if you dont have any food how do you build anything on a empty stomach.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hard sci-fi lovers fear not! Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (worm holes, time travel)  wrote a script treatment that Jonathan Nolan adapted into a screenplay based on his scientific theories. Thorne, Chris Nolan, & Co. know what they're doing; we can barely put together a premise based on these trailers, which is a good thing imo. It's been a while since a movie has blown me away and I think this one might be swinging for the fences."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If you see the casting at IMDB, you can see that there is Young Murph (Mackenzie Foy), Murph at a midle age (Jessica Chastain) and old Murph (Ellen Burstyn), this last one prorbably will play Murph when she ´s more than 70 years old......same thing for Tom, played at a midle age by Casey Affleck and as an old man by William Devane.........This is going to be Epic.....In Nolan We Trust!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the idea behind this film is simple, the ability to use a wormhole to jump to another planet and find a livable environment is perfectly plausible, though highly unlikely, and depending on the development of technology and the plausibility of being able to colonize mars and sustain that would not be plausible at all, we have technology to make that work for some time, but not for the 50+years this film is seeming to aim at. Interstellar travel is a fact of live and will happen eventually assuming our race evolves enough and the parameters of physics happen, due to the high likelihood that the ability of earth to sustain us as lifeforms will end. and while we may not know exactly how wormholes work in every facet, they do seem to be the best option in terms of interstellar travel out there due to the distances between solar systems being to great. this movie isn't silly, nor is it illogical based on the parameters it gives, its just exploring a thought path that we will probably explore one day. also as far as the food problem, that could very easily happen based on solar emission spectra changing in the slightest manner due to the core composition of our sun changing, so no it is not stupid, please stop talking as if you know everything in the field of astrophysics and biology, life isnt that simple."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"what a lot of crap. Nolan ripped off anime Paprika when he made Inception, and now he does not even know where to begin."
zSWdZVtXT7E,once again it will be mind bending......and as usual  Hans zimmer at his best
zSWdZVtXT7E,The galactic plague must remain on earth. The last thing the universe needs is humans spreading their destruction and ignorance. Truth hurts!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"We one day do have to travel far beyond our solar system... I wish that ""Warp Drives"" or the ability to travel to other stars will not be possible in my lifetime..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So far, the trailer has revealed quite a bit information.  First off in you see an Indian drone or UAV, this means that America is no longer the top dog anymore which is more likely the case in the future with the East being more dominate Russia, China or India.  This movie seems to cater to the masses that believe in global warming which can hamper current food supply which is a possibility.  Last we see the space tech which has been recently revealed by Nasa using warp drive based on a proven theory by a Mexican astrophysists.  We don't see no wormholes in this trailer, but we do see a ship with a mass ring around it and we also see a bubble that pulls, expands and decontracts the space around it.  Most likely its warp drive.  Also in the beginning you see the boy grown man, and later on in the trailer you see the girl in a red hair also grown wearing Matthews jacket. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I haven't wanted to see a movie this bad ever. Can't wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The soundtrack of this trailer is a cover. The original piece by Dario Marianelli is called Evey Reborn and part of the score of V for Vendetta.
zSWdZVtXT7E,A civilization capable to interstellar travel cannot cope with crop issues? Hummm...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yeah a man's dream is to be capable of interstellar travel, to explore...
Sadly we'll probably never make it so far, we'll destroy ourselves and our planet in the decades to come, cause we can't cooperate as humanity in whole :("
zSWdZVtXT7E,If it was anyone but Nolan I would be saying that this could go either way but as its Nolan its gonna be awesome. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,when is this coming out
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well that was hateful. What's with the racial slur? Didn't see any need for that. But I'm plenty smart to understand analysis of film. I'm just saying if we broke down every film the way you all are, we'd never enjoy any of them."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This has probably been said before, but this is going to be Christopher Nolan's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Looks like a masterpiece."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Food is in desperately short supply. Better build the rocket in the middle of a cornfield so the exhaust can blowtorch all those crops.

It has the stink of Nolan all over it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have long believed that not only exploring the cosmos, but learning to survive and thrive in that environment needs to receive far, far more funding and attention than it does now.

Not for commerce, not for manifest destiny, not for the technological windfalls it may provide, not for national prestige but as a survival imperative for all of humanity........."
zSWdZVtXT7E,They're running out of food and they don't need engineers anymore yet they still play football. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer has done it again!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Keyword: I'm coming back
zSWdZVtXT7E,just tell me how chris nolan hasnt won an oscar
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That red-head actress, who we see just for one second, is JESSICA CHASTAIN, and she is one of the greatest living actresses. She did movies like ""The Tree of Life"", ""Zero Dark Thirty"", ""The Help"", ""Take Shelter"" and ""Wilde Salomé""... watch her movies if you didn't.... you won't regret it...


Sorry for my English!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan's cinematography is amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hopefully is better than Gravity.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have been waiting for half a year for this trailer.
I'm going to go jerk off brb.
Kidding.
Looks good though."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goosebumps..One of my most anticipated film's of 2014. Nolan + McConaughey = Epic Masterpiece.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is gonna be so f*cking awesome !!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Funny how many people want to explore the universe...
When we have universes inside each and every one of us..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you, I love you. With all my heart, I love you."" -VFV"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anna hatheway is travelling with  Matthew McConaughey at 1:53...Muggles...Watch again
zSWdZVtXT7E,CANNOT WAIT
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We don't need engineers on Earth"".  Seriously?  I totally want to see us go to space, but can we PLEASE stop this bull about the planet being a train wreck, and we have to get off the train?  Yes, I get that they want to have a 'compelling' reason to go to space, but what about doing it as a voyage of discovery?  Are we too cynical these days?  There are lots of good reasons to go to space that have nothing to do with the planet 'dying'.  Such as gathering resources (even in our own solar system); there are trillions of dollars worth of resources (various metals) in the form of asteroid mining, or Helium 3 extraction, etc.  That would create jobs, and do a hell of a lot for certain resource scarcities."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope this film guives us a satisfying result, unlike prometheus for instance..
I hope they're gonna find what they're looking for and settle there..
We are not far from this fictional reality, change is required ..
or
maybe
im a bit drunk"
zSWdZVtXT7E,christopher nolan my fav director..........fantastic trailer............waiting to watch the movie.......
zSWdZVtXT7E,Aliens? Im in
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Astronaut Farmer + Contact = Interstellar? Still REALLY looking forward to this movie....Looks amazing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"We as a species must use the feelings that this and other media make manifest in us, as our ancestors believed that it was our manifest destiny to control every part of this Earth sphere, so to must we call up that same bravery to take our place...amongst the stars."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well obviously Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain are Matthew McConaughey's character children when they are older.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looking so so awesome. Can't wait to see it. Already accepted the fact it'll have me in tears more than once ;-)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well obviously Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain are Matthew McConaughey's character children when they are older.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Running out of food? That would seem something that ""engineers"" in a free market economy could reasonably fix, especially with the resources of the entire solar system at their disposal. Should have picked a more imaginative reason for strife, such as nuclear war, super plague, AI uprising, etc. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music. xD
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It looks more like a warp bubble than a wormhole, so the means of travel is probably the alcubierre drive. The trailer is awesome, if I were given the opportunity to go to another star system at the cost of leaving everything behind, I will."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"OMG¡¡¡¡, the worm hole looks alucinating¡¡¡¡"
zSWdZVtXT7E,They say that they ran out of food but all I can see is corn. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks so good
zSWdZVtXT7E,This really needs to be watched on the big screen
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So...  no food...  on Earth and all other Solar System colonies?   also, 1:35, same music composer as Gattaca's?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,we ran out of food... so it's more plausible to spend billions to send someone to a distant part of the universe instead of building  hydroponic gardens or colonizing mars.... Don't get me wrong I'm going to see this movie and more than likely like it. But I really hope that's not the plot device for our adventure. it better be something like the sun is going to go nova 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"They go through a wormhole in order to achieve distances impossible for mankind in conventional methods, just to get nailed out by a Romulan Warbird. Now THAT would be funny XD"
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's the music used towards the end? Anyone know the name? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Engineers could also come up with ways to more efficiently farm and create more food. Also, I can't believe that they are still ignoring the real problem: there are too many damn people! Population control so we can live sustainably. And we can do that now, people just need to remove the blinders and see that we are our own biggest problem. That having been said, this movie looks AMAZING!!!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just keep coming back to this trailer every couple days. The amount I want to be alive for mankind's first steps beyond our own solar system... I cannot put it into words.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music? Composer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,aaand they`ll find prometheus 
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is going to be the best movie ever mathew is the best actor in hollywood
zSWdZVtXT7E,OMG - so much good philosophy packed into this trailer - its is going to be a great movie I can tell (does Nolan ever disappoint?!). Sounds like a soundtrack off V for Vendetta which is an interesting link in terms of underlying messages and tone.
zSWdZVtXT7E,i hope nobody watches this and thinks that engineers don't have anything to do with the food industry. lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i like this cast in the next nolan movie: bryan cranston,lea seydoux,jeremy renner,christopher plummer,brie larson and kaitlyn dever"
zSWdZVtXT7E,based on the theories of kip thorne
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i liked the trailer, i hope this movie kick some ass!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is currently the best director in Hollowood. This movie will be huge. Can't wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Jessica Chastain is probably Cooper's daughter in the ""futur"", i already see him coming back, still the same age and her older."
zSWdZVtXT7E,honestly.. what is this movie about? space and earth?? i dont get it !! :C
zSWdZVtXT7E,The movie deals with time travel.  The bearded guy at the beginning during the crop burning is his son and the woman wearing his jacket at the crop burning near the end of the trailer us his daughter… obviously idk for sure but thats what I think
zSWdZVtXT7E,warp bubble at the end? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,this can be a great movie hope it will be amazing like incepion
zSWdZVtXT7E,the soundtrack feels so familiar...?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I generally don't take much notice of trailers but I must say this looks extremely promising.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I already hate the ending. Please don't let him come back. We want a modern, believable story about sacrifice, not yet another over-glorified 80's action hero rehash."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Meh, spacial distortion based drive that shortens the distance that must be traveled? Not gonna work, and there are better ways anyway; but it does make for one hell of a special effect. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,😱👏👏👏👍👌😊😃
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan
Matthew McConaughey
Michael Caine

More than enough to satisfy me"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So here's what i think... (Posible Spoilers)
Bill Irwin (Who'slisted as a main cast member) doesn't even has a second of footage in this trailer,and Jessica Chastain appears for only a very few moment and is wearing Cooper's Jacket,somy belief is that Bill Irwin willplay future Cooper,and Jessica Chastain will play future Murph (Cooper's daugther)... "
zSWdZVtXT7E,this single trailer.. beats most poopie junk that are coming out of hollywood these days
zSWdZVtXT7E,This has Bradbury written all over it. I am so watching this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,lol weak.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"As a big sci-fi fan and physics nazi
I'm sold. Shut up and take my money."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Already know this will be my fav movie of all time
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Best movie of the year .. November , remember !! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Kept replaying this trailer just to listen to the music...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It looks like a sci-fi with no sci-fi...I expected a lot of interstellar travel, new worlds or somoething but this movie looks down to earth"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Murphy's law? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Can't wait for November 7, 2014 "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie is going to ruin my life, or at the very least my fragile psyche."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That man looks like Bill nye the science guy

"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan
WE TRUST."
zSWdZVtXT7E,And the Academy Award for Best Picture goes to...
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks so great. I love Nolan.
zSWdZVtXT7E,lets hope the plot is not absurd as the leak made it out to be.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Chills all over my brain..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I feel like I just watched the hole movie, no need to go to cinema"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What I love about Christopher Nolan is that he treats his audience as if they have intelligence, he doesn't feel the need to spell everything out our dumb it down, while creating thought provoking and enjoyable movies. He is without a doubt one of my favourite directors."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Really looking forward to this, afterall its from Christopher Nolan I doubt it'll be bad. It will probably have some mindblowing stuff in the end like getting stuck in time and comes back 50 years later ""I'm coming back"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,amazing trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks similar to 2001: a space Odyssey imo.
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that the song from v for vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,at 1:34 what were those things those pepole were lying in?
zSWdZVtXT7E,that little girl may be anne hathaway when older 
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:41 that women is Murphy as an adult
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Some of these comments are so fucking stupid people, its like use common sense its like none of you have ever seen a before. Or watched a trailer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Watching this for the fourth time I figured out the plot and the general sequence of the movie...I'll keep it to myself though, i don't like spoilers "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"To all of you who are saying it looks like there are holes in the story just from the trailer. This is from Christopher Nolan, a man where you have to watch the full film four times before you get the complexity of the plot. I am excited. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't stop rewatching this trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gets me everytime. I'll be so mad at Nolan if that doesn't work out.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Everything is cool except this annoying orange/blue filter on everything...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alcubierre's interstellar warp engine?
zSWdZVtXT7E,If any wants to know the name of the song it's called evey reborn
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I really hope this a deep and thought provoking movie. Humans are destroying Earth, at some point we will have to migrate to another planet and I hope this film addresses that. The technological advancements we have to make, the social and psychological implications of migrating. The film has the potential to be amazing.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wish all farmers are this important and smart. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,i cant wait any longer
zSWdZVtXT7E,""" I'm coming back "" ... oh yeah ..coming back to what ?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Girl looks like a young Emma Stone
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Humans were never meant to do anything, but we are capable of progressing after religion ( delusion / insanity ) is eliminated."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"



WARPSPEED!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A Nolan trailer 
1. Epic music 
2. Michael Caine 
3. Another actor from one of his previous film 
4. Pure awesomeness 
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I will be buying this on bluray when it comes out and I haven't seen it ... why? Because I want to see more of these kind of sci-fi films: Films that question humanity in the 21st century... will we meet aliens? Will we destroy ourselves? Will be solve our world problems? Will humanity become unified (politically speaking) What is humanities role in this universe? These are fascinating questions all which appear in the sci-fi domain.

Note: I've bought ""Enders Game"", ""Cloud Atlas"" & ""Oblivion"" in this manner and I have no regrets whatsoever as those where fantastic films as I'm sure this one will be too. :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,whats murphys law??
zSWdZVtXT7E,will there be aliens?
zSWdZVtXT7E,2012 roland emmerich movie was garbage...But dis one is so realistic..Christoper Nolan proved it again...Amazing trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,What is that round bubble thing at 1:55? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,father never comes back so anne hathaway goes to find her father sorry for the spoiler trailer says it all
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love Christopher Nolan but I`m just not excited by this trailer, reminds me too much of Armageddon."
zSWdZVtXT7E,gave me goose bumps!!! wwwooooo!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't remember the name of the composer, but the film was v for vendetta"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks bloody good!
zSWdZVtXT7E,explain the plot?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I do like that they didn't make another one of those trailers that give away the entire plot.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i wish i could live enough to see this day, the day that mankind start the colonization of the stars."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Two words, Time Dilation. We all know Chis  is fixated with time in his movies.  I'm a fan of him because of it. 

Matthew's character tells the girl, I will be back. He will, but the uncertainty is if SHE (MANKIND) will be there when he returns. 

If you talk about interstellar space travel, time dilation is the number one factor in planning for it. You can't get around it unless Eisenstein was wrong. 

Unless its a wormhole. But that leaves more uncertainty because we're not sure what's on the otherside.of it. Matthew's character seems certain he is coming back, just not to what (state of the planet). We do know about Time Dilation though.  I hope someone tackles this in a plot if he didn't. 

"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What does Mathew say for his first line? Matt, we had a flyer?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is a Christopher Nolan movie. All the reason I need to watch it :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Remember, remember the fifth of november :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mckenzie Foy (young murphy) resembles Emma Stone more than Jessica Chastain
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Powerful line: ""Nothing in our solar system can help us!"" Excellent trailer Kudos that line draws you in and the film becomes a logical hook. Kind Regards Cap'n Joe ;)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Thumbs up if you find the new YouTube like bar annoying.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why so bad!?
zSWdZVtXT7E,@joseph. You say you read the eariler script and kinda chancy. A few spoilers perhaps I would like to know
zSWdZVtXT7E,FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON MY SPACECRAFT
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For all of you who question why the wormhole is there.  They characters in the movie ask the same thing.  In the script, they talk about how it's near impossible for the wormhole to appear in our solar system without destroying it.  The only other option is that it was placed there on purpose.  I won't ruin it for you, but that's enough to let your mind race.  This movie will be a game changer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm coming back ... NOT
zSWdZVtXT7E,"mmmm... Nolan....
mmmm... Jessica Chastain"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"No worries, Elon Musk will save us all."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music by V For Vendetta Soundtrack - Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli
Great song ^^"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Let's see if it beats 'Contact'...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine. Will definitely watch this. Should include Morgan Freeman also to make it more epic............. (I hope)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Haha neat. Dario marionelli's evey reborn used as soundtrack in this video. (From V for Vendetta)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"God, I'm so excited about this movie!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Isn't this trailer music the same as the scene in V for Vendetta when the detective shares his ""feeling"" about what will happen?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"hmm, might be alright, i read the early script, kind of chancy if you ask me, but seems like it might be interesting"
zSWdZVtXT7E,That little girl could be a younger Emma Stone.
zSWdZVtXT7E,almost in every christopher nolan movie there is alfred from batman :D 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This will rock
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks amazing. cant wait to see it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Maybe something happened to the sun. The sun is variable, maybe a lot variable at times."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't know why some of you are saying Nolan's given the whole plot away - he's never known for making that mistake. From what I've seen here, where the trailer ends is where the movie really STARTS.

""Interstellar chronicles the adventures of a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.""

See what I mean...?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,goosebumbs
zSWdZVtXT7E,"can't believe this movie has got some naysayers, this is a flippin Christopher Nolan movie! the man has not made a bad movie"
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music. Anyone?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Trying to make the next 2001: a space odyssey?
zSWdZVtXT7E,No movie is an intellectual challenge. Movies are entertainment. To watch one and enjoy it you have to suspend your disbelief. Do that often enough and you end up stupid. So I guess in a way that does challenge your intellect. In fact it gets rid of some of it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,One of MANY things i love about Nolan movies. Not afraid to epic music even if its heard in other movies. This trailer music originally heard in V for vendetta. Man of Steel trailer music can be heard in The Lord of the Rings. If it gets the emotion accross..so what if its been used before. Love that about him..
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh the possibilities !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Check out the new international trailer including new scenes!
Interstellar - International Trailer - Official"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Interstellar - International Trailer - Official
zSWdZVtXT7E,The ponderous never ending damn violins.
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's sad because even if he does come back his daughter would be long dead.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I agree morons
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ooooo... so many debates in the house!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"People keep saying this has something to do with global warming. I don't see that. I see a story about humanity finally fulfilling an age old dream. People can whine and complain and analyze and reanalyze and complain some more, but I am still looking forward to this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I might be wrong but I think jessica chastain will play the grown up murphy you know matthew mcconaugheys daughter in the film 
zSWdZVtXT7E,mcconaissance continues.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why does John Lithgow's character grab Murphy when she comes running out? It's not like she will be able to catch up with her father who is racing away in his car.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Interstellar! :'D 
November, Come Soon! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"OK. This concerns you who are fans of Original Motion Picture Soundtracks. Can anyone tell me is the composer of the music in this trailer, and what previous movie it was made for? I would really appreciate identifying it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Great trailer, doesn't give too much info away!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The same music was used in V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,I noticed in the trailer that older Murph is wearing her dad's jacket and I just think that's a really nice touch.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Time is a flat circle.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I disagree with the statement the man made at 0:48 about nothing in this solar system being able to help us. There are vast quantities of wealth in asteroids alone. We will need this wealth to build greater space ships that will takes us beyond this solar system.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks kinda mopey. Ugh, no sale.
Want something more uplifting like Gravity or Armageddon.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler: He doesn't come back
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We didn't run out of planes and television sets.. we ran out of food.""

Yea because our whole system of feeding the entire world population wasn't made by farmers, nor the application of how to make crops that grow larger and for longer periods (well scientists technically but engineers created the mass manufacturing of it).

Already seems full of fallacies."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really need the original soundtrack! Imo this song doesn't really suits with the film
zSWdZVtXT7E,"he;s going to leave and come back and many years will have passed on earth but not for him, you can see his kids older in this trailer. which makes no sense if he's traveling by wormhole..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Global Warming is just another computer program. Might as well be a movie I guess.
zSWdZVtXT7E,A movie not focused on boobs and big explosions?! IMPOSSIBRU! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So far the hypothetical scenario is a bit farfetched. Its not even far in the future, it looks like its either today or sometime close to today. My closest assumption is  a giant life-ending solar catastrophe that's like a massive massive explosion in  the ....sun. ok. thats terrible. because its just solar flares."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Along with Jessica Chastain being an older Murph, I have a hunch that Casey Affleck is Cooper's son (Timothée Chalamet) grown up as well. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,might as well throw another oscar at matthew mcconaughey the fella is on a role
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope this will be epic like Inception and the Dark Knight Trilogy. i love Christopher Nolan
zSWdZVtXT7E,"*Most anticipated film of this year, and probably in a long time*"
zSWdZVtXT7E,2001 anyone? no? just me?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That at the end is not a black hole, it's a wormhole. 
"" a ""shortcut"" through spacetime. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends each in separate points in spacetime."" - Wikipedia. 
Since earth is apparently running out of food, they wish to go through the wormhole into interstellar space, in search of a new planet similar to earth. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,@1:55 is that a black hole that they are about to enter or is that space bending ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:55 Black Hole ? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oh my god, this music is so wonderfull. Just because of that I think I will rewatch V for Vendetta :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan films are the only reason I go to the cinema anymore
zSWdZVtXT7E,movie magic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is so bloody stupid. Its showing the selfishness of the human race. So instead of trying to fix mother Earth after destroying it for hundreds of years, you just leave??"
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta in case you're wondering
zSWdZVtXT7E,We're not meant to save the world......We're meant to leave it
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer's Music always gives me goosebumps...it's bloody amazing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,cant wait for the movie to come
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think it's gonnna be like Armageddon
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh God... I'm getting ridiculously hyped for this and we're still over five months out... please don't let this be Prometheus all over again...
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:40 some women just want to watch the corn burn.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't go to movies to be taught lessons. I go to movies to be entertained. If this is about preaching about Global Warming then It is annoying.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""I don't know if you're coming back.""

""I'm coming back...Time is a flat circle.""

Only True Detective fans will get that."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie is gonna be a punch right in our brains.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Blimey I cannot wait for this movie! A space movie that seems heartening. And the music in that trailer...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have great expectations about this movie.......Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Cain & Matthiew of course are all marvelous actors........I don't see how this movie can possibly fail unless they are badly directed."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"My school class went to see the actual set and they gave us NO credit for helping in the actual set
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,the next Gravity that will win 7 oscars :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,So this will happen when Catwoman go to space?
zSWdZVtXT7E,not so great trailer but glad that it dint give away everything.. will watch it for sure!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,They better shoot some aliens in this!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The teaser looked great, but this trailer is average "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait to see this movie.I'm over excited :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,I thought the women wearing the astronaut suit in the thumbnail was kaya scodelario.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer do it again. Except this is the thing I live for. Go be multi-planetary, you can do it homo-sapiens! Hopefully this movie takes the spot of Inception as my favorite movie!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"when i watched  this trailer i remembered the line from toy story  "" from infinity and beyond"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,X men first class just came out and it looks like the best 2014 movie yet hope interstellar surpasses it faith in nolan
zSWdZVtXT7E,"this will have more plotholes than wormholes. nolan is one of most, boring, bland and unimaginative director ever. lol ripped off from star trek. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have great expectations on this movie. I hope it's going to be awesome. Please don't disappoint me, Warner."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love this trailer! It's intriguing without spoiling everything about it... Good job!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is Casey Affleck the son?
zSWdZVtXT7E,So essentially the film is about Murphy's law.
zSWdZVtXT7E,There is a leaked script that I read about 1/2 way through and it had me hooked if the movie sticks to the script it should something really special. I am very eager to see this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Inception
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Chris nolan always leaves you with a great anticipation for his movies.Interstellar is gonna rock hollywood,as its a sci-fi movie which is really going to be non fictious.Awaiting for this movie"
zSWdZVtXT7E,the trailer track is giving me goosebumps
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Okay, does the music remind anyone else of that one scene from V for Vendetta?
Cause its kinda driving me nuts."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks hella boring
zSWdZVtXT7E,Indian surveillance drone? What is that entire segment of the trailer referring to? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I was trying to figure out this music and it sounds like its from v for vendetta or shawshank redemption
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goddammit Nolan. Is there anything you can't do?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"love it, reminiscent of  80s era space movies in some scenes."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dario Marianelli has the power to regulate my first impressions about any movie.﻿
zSWdZVtXT7E,It smells like 'Movie of the year'...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is just a trailer of the future, you know that right?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm getting a strong ""The Grapes of Wrath""+""2001: A Space Odyssey"" vibe here. I think the movie will be about Earth being unable to sustain life anymore due to overpopulation, pollution, and natural disasters which prompts humanity to venture into the universe in search of a new home. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Pretty confused when I first saw the trailer and heard V for Vendetta's soundtrack.﻿
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music on this is so powerful and emotive. Fits perfectly into the trailer, it's like a second storyteller."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"These comments are filled with presumptuous arseholes who are convinced they know everything about physics. ""It's a black hole,"" uhh no that destroys matter. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan is bad or overrated?? he made two stunning masterpiece,who do you like? Bay?
you guys focus on visuals way too much,it's like: 1-visuals,2-actors,3-plot. 
when it should be:1-plot,2-actors,3-visuals.
you are ruining both cinema and the gaming industry! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"People who are hating on this are trolls of the highest proportion! 

Nolan is a genius "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did they use the same space ship from The Last Starfighter?!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm coming back.... (Save the world)
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks like it is going to go along similar lines as Contact
zSWdZVtXT7E,We Chose to come here so actually we have to Heal this Planet. I Love Chris Nolan but I don't agree with the plot of this Film.
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan We Trust 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool a new Christopher Nolan movie! Where's Joseph Gordon-Levitt?
zSWdZVtXT7E,v for vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,ACADEMY AWARD WINNER MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sound of a glass sky at 1:56.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Flat, lol! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:53 Jesus christ thats terrifying
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I guess when your all male strip club doesn't work out, going to space is the next best thing."
zSWdZVtXT7E,you know it is going to be good when Nolan is the director!
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is gonna b d best science fiction movie ever.  Nolan direction and music by hans zimmer about black hole. Ooooh cant wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music sounds like ""eveys reborn"" from v for vendetta!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's a movie! If you want something more genuine go back to school. Why bother watching the trailer if it is such a waste of time. I find it most refreshing compared to other movies that are soon to be in theater. ..for instance TMNT.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oh no, I was looking really forward to this until I saw the kids.

Please don't let them have a lot of screen time..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"finally some ""sci"" in an scifi movie again ... looks great"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If the next ""2001"" is out there then this may very well be it. Remember that that all time classic was (& still is) one of the most misunderstood movies ever made. Nolan is THAT smart & uncompromising. McConaughey's last sci-fi film was the vastly under-rated & excellent ""Contact"" with Jodie Foster which is Robert Zemeckis's best film. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Near future, global warming, new dust bowls resulting in food shortages, mass migration, military control? And a crewed interstellar mission looking for what exactly? Help? A new home? I certainly hope this doesn't turn out to be a film all about the Dads promise to come home. From the trailer it looks like the daughter has grown up waiting for his return. And if you were sending a mission down a wormhole for the first time knowing it could be a one way trip, surely you'd send enough people to start over ...."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The Dark Knight was Nolan's Masterpiece, don't compare this film with that Epic film, it's a space thriller along with the concept of Apocalypse, I guess"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like albecurrie drive
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hate this trailer to death, it gave away too much of the story, ruined it a bit for me"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm confused...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love that they borrowed a selection from the V for Vendetta soundtrack for this trailer. If anyone's bent out of shape over it, the main trailer for V for Vendetta also borrowed a great piece - Encounter from Klaus Badelt's Equilibrium soundtrack."
zSWdZVtXT7E,WHO ELSE GOT GOOSE BUMPS 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The trailer basically just shows the first half of the film. We dont see what happens when we he gets back.  Casey Afleck and Jessica C. are his kids grown up.  I think he finds a planet or a civilization, and this is just the beginning of us making the journety.  Its not like 5 billion or going to get on a transport. He finds a planet....and human kind now has a new place to go."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This will be the 2001 a space odyssey of this century.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Great! I'm loving it so far! It's almost like Star Ocean The Last Hope except there was no nuclear war and there's no advanced space ship and it doesn't seem like the worlds united.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"ripped off from star trek enterprise. this may well be nolans ""Signs"" and show shyamalan how to make a movie filled with stupidity. lol nolan, blandly going where others have boldly gone before."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christian Nolan is one of the most stupidest movie makers ever. Inception is totally overrated and the dark knight was boring shit. He needs to learn how to make good movies from Michael bay. INTERSTELLAR looks like a copy of every other sci-fi movie. ugh this movie will bomb
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm onboard 😆😎😎😎😎
zSWdZVtXT7E,"guy directed two movies apart with ""in"" in the beginning title as adjectives."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan is the best director of all time and I can't wait for this
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan? Matthew McConaughey? Hans Zimmer? How could I resist?!?!?!?!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can not wait for it .. :-- )
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope this movie focuses more on the science fiction rather than the drama 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This will end in a paradoxical time loop.
The protagonist will unknowingly fly back in time and land on earth 200000 years in the past, have sex with lovely apes and his copilot and be founder of humanity as we know it. ;)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I need it.......... so badly.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The title seems familiar to daft punk anime movie called Interstella 5555...
zSWdZVtXT7E,6/10. Won't waste money on going to the cinema for but a rental is worth it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am coming back. In Space time :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,And let all the stupid movie critics comment start!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I believe that there father (Matthew) went through a worm hole and the young girl (Murphy) grows up and that's Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck is the oldest son and I believe there father hasn't came back in many years ... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks great! I would expect nothing less from Christopher Nolan. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer is very reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey - the space suits, hibernation capsules, scenes with spacecraft in space, and ambient intensity to name a few. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think it will be a smart movie, specially because Jip Thorne is involved ( a famous Scientific with works about worm holes) I guess it will have a lot of jump of time a la Inception, but Time travels instead Dream layers. The thing I disagree is that apparently humans destroyed Earth, and now they are going to other place, this does not have anything to do with  the main theme of Interstellar first trailer. In that one, human wante to discover the unknown. Now, they have to move to anotherplace becasue their home is wasted (by them). Also, if you travel trough a worm hole the time changes, so, what is the point to travel there if when you come back to earth, a lot of years have passed by?? It is no easie trying on mars?? IT is not easier trying to save Earth?? If you could fly close to Saturn so fast, could enter inside a Worm Hole, maybe you could have some ways to save Earth or install Mars Colony."
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i'm guessing in this movie Matthew doesn't return from his mission and his kids grow up and succeed. I hope it isn't that predictable. Like someone else said,  Jessica Chastain's character is wearing the same jacket as Matt's in the beginning and the trailer seems to focus an awful lot on the kids."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"as big supporter and fan of space exploration related things, I would surely watch this. 

hell, I might even boot KSP as well  and watch some NASA videos, this got me pumped up"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey for Doctor Strange!! What you think?!
zSWdZVtXT7E,total starship troopers rip off
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Alright, alright, alright..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,WANT!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Warning! 
To completely and understand the movie and its plot it is required a Phd. in the following areas: Physics, astronomy and philosophy."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Haven't looked forward to a movie as much as this in a while. Please don't screw this up!! I doubt they'll actually make a return journey in-movie and let us all know what happened but I find the plot itself extremely interesting. From what I can tell the swirling black ball looked like some kind of wormhole (generic, I know) but I love the detail of the outer edge swirling around the still center, almost like an accretion disk around a black hole's event horizon. This movie could be amazing or horribly, horribly awful."
zSWdZVtXT7E,they should have used the teaser trailer's music. Hans Zimmer ftw!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is my latest favorite trailer because it is using Evey Reborn as the song, and I must say, it worked well with it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,0:01 valorie curry??...  1:32 anne hathaway and casey affleck o west bentley??..i think.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The beginning of Man of Steel only from Earth.
zSWdZVtXT7E," 
I wish this film the best of success. I hope it opens up a serious debate about our declining resources, our environment, and our survival as a species. However, here is a question. Why in the trailer (and I strongly assume in the film) there is technology that can help a spaceship travel at those great distances in space, but no technology that can reverse hunger, climate change, etc?﻿
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Even though I generally liked the movie, this better not end like Contact.  But anyway, being an astronomy nut I am extremely excited for this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What a great movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone hating on Nolan and any of his movies, Including inception which was a cinematographic masterpiece, is a half witted moron who knows nothing about film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can already feel the feels..
zSWdZVtXT7E,This film gonna be epic! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"#interstellar, looks good, but, 'NOVEMBER, really!!!!!!!' "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Could turn out to be like any of his other recent movies, people will bow before this movie when it comes out but soon after it'll be cut up and over analyzed. I'm excited for it though, shows tons of promise."
zSWdZVtXT7E,True Detective meets Orbital. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,
zSWdZVtXT7E,can't wait to see it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks awesome :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Ok, we're facing massive climactic change. Should we either use known, proven hydroponic technologies en-masse to confront this issue or instead base everything on taking a shot at hurling a small crew through a wormhole we don't understand to see if maybe an inhabitable planet is on the other side?"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its funny how all the critics think they know it all when they forgot the one critical aspect of movies is that its just a movie ! Entertainment dumb asses 
zSWdZVtXT7E,
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer gives me the shivers... This is suppose to be a drama but i get more thrills than anything else
zSWdZVtXT7E,Warp travel!! WOW
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Evey reborn, best thing to come out of the V for vendetta film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks very interesting, though ultimately I see humans repeating their same mistakes no matter where they end up on : neglecting their planet till it's too late to then look for an other one and so, the vicious cycle goes on. Pessimistic, I know. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Some analysis. 1:40 , the chick looks like the daughter all grown up. 1:54 , they enter an event horizon, where theoritically, time slows down. I'll bet that the plot goes along the lines of Mcconaughey getting trapped. When he gets out, what feels like only a little while, turns out to be several years. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"National Geographic had something similar ""quasar headed for earth"" humans had 50 years to construct a World ship to leave our solar system. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"8,001st comment? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"One thing i'm really looking forward to is seeing what kind or universe Nolan plans or ""planed"" to make, and that hopefully it doesn't show too much of earth. I really love it when his movies hang with the ""out there."" I know i will feel slight disappointment if it shows the main goal of the story at the end."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I didn't know trailers were supposed to spoil the film.

So, Jessica Chastain is obviously adult Murphy. The ship/crew went through some kind of time warp, was unable to communicate with Earth and everyone was presumed dead. The crew (less a few members) came back at nearly the same age as they left while everyone on Earth aged 20 years.

Thanks, trailer.

Best guess is that the ""New Earth"" they find is actually very old, pre-human Earth and the survivors go there to live and try to change the path Earth takes toward desolation."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Once it's not full of mindless robots fighting eachother, gallons of gasoline blowned up, dramatic action scenes or ""from the beggining to the end"" obvious plot, most of these ""critics"" tend to bitch about the movie all day long. Pathetic.

I bet most of you never saw a single movie from Bergman, Tarkovskij, Vláčil or anyone outside Hollywood. For me, Interstellar has an appeal for Nolan's best movie to date (although I love The Prestige). Stunning visuals, attempt for something else than stupid blockbuster and (I hope) honour to the best sci-fi pieces such as 2001: Space Odyssey.

Just wait for your brainless Transformers: Zillionth Sequel, that's the title you are looking for."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This Film is going to be awesome. You people should have faith in Nolan, and to those who don't like him why are you even commenting. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Soundtrack - Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have a feeling there's a lot more to this movie than what's in the trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,ONE QUSETION- IS THAT SPACE SHUTTLE RUSSIAN MADE?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks AWESOME.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What is the song that is playing in the background? Sounds vaguely familiar, from another movie scored by hans Zimmer perhaps?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It's encouraging to see Nolan deal with actual human issues rather than moralistic (superhuman) ones. This is the inevitable outcome of the collective ""us"". How we act as we outgrow out planet will define us as a species. I wonder if the general public is ready for these outlandish ideas. Better buy two popcorns just to be safe.
 "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Damn the soundtrack is amazing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"V for Vendetta's soundtrack...
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Who is the female actor at 1:52 ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Haven't been this excited about a film since Prometheus. Really hope it delivers...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks Awesome.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this the sequel to Contact? Where is Jodie Foster? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mackenzie Foy is such a great actor <3
zSWdZVtXT7E,Im coming back...CHILLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,can't wait
zSWdZVtXT7E,Please. Let this be not more of Europa Report and better than Gravity.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The women that appears in the 1:40 minute most be the grown up main character‘s daughter murphy, or maybe her mother but that dosnt would make any sense to me.

Pd. Sorry for my english."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Haters everywhere...  Idiots started to criticize the film with this 2:54 min trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like Alfred's stepped up in life since he worked for Batman...
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks good :) btw is that the girl from twilight ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,this will be the best movie this year so transformers kids can go away cuz they wont like it xD
zSWdZVtXT7E,It appears that many here who have not experienced adversity cannot relate to a masterpiece portraying people who come together to overcome it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,i bet the movie ends like it ends in the trailer! would be so freaking bad -.- now if the movie had a continuety to it a universe of it's own wil alot of story telling that would be awesome!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For everyone saying that this is Hanz Zimmer, it's actually Evey Reborn by Dario Marianelli..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,i never once in my life thought i would one day see how the cosmos looked when we warped through space bending it......as a cosmology fan i thank you for showing me this luminous and didactic masterpiece. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow the girl really look like Anne Hathaway.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"To those asking about the music in this trailer, it's a track from the movie V for Vendetta; the track is called Evey Reborn by Dario Marianelli."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think he's not coming back. It's Chris Nolan's film ladies and gentlemen! I can't wait for it!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is not the film we deserve, but the one we need.
I'm not sure I've ever been so excited for a movie, this trailer speaks to me on many many levels."
zSWdZVtXT7E,YAY! Looking forward to this one :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Really excited for this, finally a sci-fi movie about space that will be both good and realistic. Cannot wait."
zSWdZVtXT7E,holy mother of all three dragons
zSWdZVtXT7E,the song is from V for Vendetta..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The Dark Knight - Universe
can't wait!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The plot is about the human race moving forward as in reality earth cannot be our only home. This movie is talking about when the time comes the human race needs to find another home. Earth wont be our only home otherwise we would all die, this is what this movie is about and I cant wait too see it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For all of you about to comment that ""this is clearly going to be a horrible movie because"" whatever, let me just point you to a movie similar to this. Doesn't have the same plot, but it does have the same pace (at least from what I can tell). There's a little movie out there made in the late 90's called ""Contact""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music:  EVEY REBORN - DARIO MARIANELLI
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks pretty boring tbh. christian nolan is a really overrated director.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just got news that everything in this trailer is from the first 1/3 of this movie! There are no scenes in this trailer from acts 2 or 3. That just makes me so much more excited!!  
zSWdZVtXT7E,People need to shut their mouth. It's not even released yet and people are saying its flop. What they know about this movie because you can not get a single hint of how the plot is and what's its going to be like?Keep ur hatred away and wait for the movie!Don't try be smart ass when you know you are not!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"THERE IS A LOT MORE to this movie than what the trailer shows.

Nolan is good about hiding things."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The whole family drama really ruins movies where there is a message trying to be delivered, like it did in Godzilla and World War Z. I know they're trying to target a larger audience and since I'm not a parent I wouldn't really understand the significance, however it usually always diverts the plot from the more important aspects of the film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that a wormhole or a black hole at 1:55??
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan likes Baseball.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"These dis liker don't know nothing do you think Nolen care about you guys 
Nolen gave a blockbuster convinced the producers and is started doing good film      i  mean a pure movie not considering the factor of success 
He and Depp are the true movie lovers They doesn't care about flops and they would be only Appreciated only after their death like bob and che
guys wake up and prove that we are fit to live here and don't say that interstellar is a great movie after 10 years and price movie like Avengers and Hollywood would start only taking action movies    "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like another great film from Nolan.  I've been on his bandwagon since I saw Memento in 2001 (I would see his first film, Following, years later) and I honestly don't think the man can make a bad film, or at least hasn't so far.  I just don't think its in his genes.  His box office worst, The Prestige, is actually one of my favorites."
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks interesting
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie's gonna be sad. Not just because of the story. But because it's true that one day we'll have to leave our beautiful home.  :(
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone who is being negative about what is in this trailer clearly do not know how Nolan does his pre release PR. He never ever releases the full plot for any of his movies and the trailer is more often than not a small by-product of the larger picture.

Interstellar will be amazing! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm looking forward to this. It's like Hollywood read my mind. I am fascinated and completely obsessed with interstellar travel. If we can't actually do it, then Hollywood is the next best thing!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why does Casey Affleck always sound like he is out of breath??
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Maybe the woman in 1.41 would be Murphy in future. 
Look at her cloth you'll see is the same of Cooper."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music sounds awesome... i presume it's Hanz Zimmer again.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music is just sublime.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The song is in V For Vendetta, which is a fantastic movie"
zSWdZVtXT7E,For all of you talking about black holes; this is not what you saw in this trailer. What you saw was a wormhole. There is a big difference between those two things.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music : Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn, from the movie V For Vendetta."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nice wormhole!
zSWdZVtXT7E,And thus begins the tale of John Crighton.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"$1 billion+ in the worldwide box office and nominations for Best Picture, Director, Actor in Leading Role, VFX, Cinematography, and Best Original Score. You heard it here first."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks amazing, and what was the name of that song!?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The soundtrack of the trailer is from V FOR VENDETTA (Evey's Reborn) Thanks
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is my fav!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm going to go ahead and put it out there that the music used in this trailer is not from this film, nor is it Hans Zimmer. It is Dario Marianelli's ""Evey Reborn"" from the V for Vendetta soundtrack.

Despite it not being a part of Interstellar's soundtrack, it's still a great choice of music for the tone of this trailer, and I'm anxious to hear what Zimmer has written for the film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,that music ! <3
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm going to be really upset if the entire movie is them preparing to go on this mission but then you don't ever get to see them make it to another planet or anything, and they just end up dying in space. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,People who have read leaked versions of the script said that this is closer in comparisson to 2001 than the heavy-action Inception.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Trailer doesn't look like Nolan to me... lets hope it's like Heath Ledger with the Joker
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is going to be amazing... has anybody noticed that this ""official"" trailer is actually NOT in HD??"
zSWdZVtXT7E,supposedly this song isnt actually zimmer. also didnt notice the older red head was wearing that jacket. makes me think of a multiple timeline plot similar to inception where we see cooper in another dimension (future) and murphy grown up waiting for him..the son too for that matter. with nolan involved you can almost assume there will be a plot twist involving time travel/kids/sacrifice?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've been waiting for a new sci-fi film like this in a while (I'm not elitist about sci-fi but I'm a great fan of harder SF).
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That music is from ""V For Vendetta."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Haha, Nolan just loves using Michael Caine!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've watched this trailer 15 times now and I still get goosebumps every damn time.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan- should let Neil deGrasse Tyson be his adviser on anything that the movie involves in space. Gravity came out last year and Dr Tyson labeled too many Scientific problems that were wrong with the movie. Just a heads up if you really want to make your movie perfect.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""In the future, governments and economies across the globe have collapsed, food is scarce, NASA is no more, and the 20th Century is to blame. A mysterious rip in spacetime opens and it's up to whatever is left of NASA to explore and offer up hope for mankind.""

Great premise, its a real one we face today if our government continues to devalue the world's most important industry driving innovation and progress which drives our economy (and therefore the global economy)."
zSWdZVtXT7E,OST is same as used in V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,Huh?? We don't have the technology to travel around in our own solar system never mind to distant stars. Why didn't they just move this story 100 years into the future. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm not sure what to think about that movie...
zSWdZVtXT7E,I almost lost faith in humanity when reading the comments but judging by the likes to dislike ratio on this video I realize that those are just the idiots in the minority with big mouths. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Okay, so the preview gave away the movie.. But the aliens on this other world, I think they are going to be JAR JAR BINKS STYLE characters"
zSWdZVtXT7E,THIS SONG IS FROM V FOR VENDETTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The people in this comment section are stupid as hell. This is Christopher Nolan we are talking about, he is one of the greatest film makers of the century, he hasn't made a bad film yet. Inception was a masterpiece and if you think this is going to be a Summer blockbuster you are sorely wrong."
zSWdZVtXT7E,and he never comes Back ! the end & its a Nolan Masterpiece.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Film looks amazing to. Nolan will smash it out the park as always.
zSWdZVtXT7E,That music is fantastic! Really makes me feel. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,We're living beyond our means.
zSWdZVtXT7E,One day I saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine; oh bugger - wrong film.
zSWdZVtXT7E,One need an uploaded mind(s) to visit stars. The human body is too fragile. Anyway the movie seems to be very interesting.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"30,451 likes vs 1,622 dislikes. I think the majority has spoken....#innolanwetrust."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"speech: what ever can happen, would happent. cant wait to see it... i mean the movie:D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's with all the hate? This film looks great.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Name of the song pleaaase? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wish they would really shoot Matthew Mcconaughey into a worm hole.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Really excited for this top secret project from Nolan. I hope it would be his next masterpiece
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wait is this for real? Why do they use the soundtrack from V for Vendetta for this trailer? It's called 'Evey Reborn' if I'm not mistaken.
zSWdZVtXT7E,it is copy of  bollywood movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So first I want to get clarify that I am a huge Nolan nut.  I loved all of his movies so far but it almost seems like I'm having to force myself to be excited about this one. If you truly love him you have to be able to criticize him too. I felt a little weird watching this. They're basically saying ""Oh wait, we exhausted the hell out of earth, polluted it to the core, ran it to the ground, lets just move out and find a new home. kthnxbai earth au revoir"". IDK if I'm interpreting it wrong but this is how I felt. I'll still going watch it first preview first day first show for sure.  #NOLANFORTHEWIN  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,speechless
zSWdZVtXT7E,what song is this
zSWdZVtXT7E,For the folks who hate cerebral sci-fi movies...  Do you automatically dismiss films such as 2001 A Space Odyssey as well?  Do you want explosions and Batmobiles in every other scene?  Nolan deserves the opportunity to make a film that doesn't just fit the mold of the everyday blockbuster.  He can do so much more.  And I hope this film does just that.  He's not dissapointed yet.
zSWdZVtXT7E,(Cough) Best (Cough Cough) Picture (Cough) 2014.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Did you know that 99% of the genetic information in you is not human?
It's the genetic information of your symbiotic bacteria and virii, without which
you could not survive.
Now if a human was transported to the surface of a living alien world, and he
was immersed in alien bacteria and virii, what would happen to him? Nothing
good, I'll bet.
On the other hand - even if we had the prerequisite technology for a manned
interstellar expedition (we don't), such an expedition would require
international co-operation, and it would be fantastically expensive. But to
reduce carbon emissions to a point at which climate change would be stabilized
would also require international co-operation, and it would be - much less
expensive. Hmmm.
So what, after all, is the point of this vile, vulgar and escapist tripe?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone know what the song is for this? It'd be nice if they put it in the info for the trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"From what I gather, the story/plot is about a last-ditch effort to preserve the human race by using experimental space technology which does work in theory but, is currently still in the developmental stages by scientists.  First, in the preview there appears to be some sort of safe and advanced cryogenic-hibernation or stasis.  Secondly, Nuclear Fusion type rocket propulsion would be necessary to reach Saturn's orbit in a reasonable time-frame.  Lastly, this safe distance from the Earth would be required in order to activate the very first experimental Alcubierre drive which (in theory) creates a warp-bubble around a spacecraft allowing it to safely break the light-barrier and reach other solar systems.  I'm not an astrophysicist, I'm just desperate to leave this planet.
  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,nolan's armageddon or nolan's space odyssey?
zSWdZVtXT7E,How do all the comments who are saying this movie will be boring or are already shooting it down getting so many likes? This lack of imagination and desire to explore the unknown is very depressing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,what is the title of this song!!!!!!!????????????
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hope this is good, proper sci-fi films are hard to come by these days "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another War of the Worlds.
zSWdZVtXT7E,No explosions in a Nolan FIlm? I buy it xD
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Why do some people try to compare this to Gravity? Are you really that stupid? ffs, the only similarity is.. space? Interstellar has nothing to do with the flick mentioned, so why even bother bringing this up? jeesh"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie is a more realistic take on SciFi and space travel, could be the launching point for a universe of it's own. 
As much as I like to believe that the earth will one day become Star Fleet Headquarters, it's a bloody pipe dream. Reality of the fact is, if we don't poison and over populate this planet, it's only a matter of time a planetary catastrophe wipes us all out.
I dig it. I've always been an avid believer, we need to start looking into leaving earth, ASAP. However that would take a global effort, and humans just aren't that sophisticated or educated yet. I wonder what triggers this mass project in the movie. 
This seems like the movie I have been waiting for. Something to give the humans a reason to start looking up at the cosmos and embrace our destiny as explorers. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've heard this song before... was it in TDK? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait for Interstellar 2 and 3!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Grown*
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Honestly surprised that no one commented on Jessica Chastain in the trailer. She is wearing his jacket, so it's safe to assume that she is Murphy all grown up.  I found that interesting.  I'm thinking when he wakes from his sleep, maybe he comes back to his children all drown up, and he is the same. 

Who knows.  But why are people so mad that they can't figure the plot? The trailer wasn't too confusing, and who wants everything spoiled?

MM has been choosing some awesome roles...hard for me to hate him anymore.

I think this movie has a lot of promise. Nolan won't disappoint!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Great soundtrack, great movie trailer "
zSWdZVtXT7E,nolan & zimmer.. what more could you ask for? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler: Storyline picks up right where Contact left off.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone else see the Alcubierre Drive concept in that spacecraft!?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Finally, something good happens to Sci Fi = )"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"that space ship is lookin' like an Alcubierre Warp Drive, look it up"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Neil deGrasse Tyson will love this film

*Sorry for trolling, coming off of a bad hangover."
zSWdZVtXT7E,well someone saw the Civilization: Beyond Earth trailer....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Please tell me the final clip is not the film's ending.

zSWdZVtXT7E,its not what you think it is. wait for it.......
zSWdZVtXT7E,What in hell did I just watch?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"People you should really quit the criticism, it looks great and how much can you know about the plot? it looks mature and finally a good space movie where there is no funny guy trying to entertain kids or war to sale good in the box office."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Formula for an epic film.
25% Relatablility (Family, Kids, Responsiblity)
25% Visual Effects (Worm Holes, Space)

zSWdZVtXT7E,nice video
zSWdZVtXT7E,That Hanz Zimmer sounds really good

zSWdZVtXT7E,what gravity part 2????? these movies scare the crap out of me
zSWdZVtXT7E,Seems V for Vendetta had a part in marketing this movie . . .
zSWdZVtXT7E,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I WANNA SEE IT
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Isn't this song from the movie ""V for Vendetta""? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the plot is suppose to involve time travel. Anybody else notice Jessica chastain kinda looks like the little girl and is wearing the Matthew mcconaughey's jacket, and casey Affleck looks like the son."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I sick of shallow bullshit science fiction films from Hollywood that don't know the first thing about SF.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've never been this excited to see a movie in my entire life. I literally got goosebumps from this trailer. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,interesting
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why does everyone say it is a black hole? Its a wormhole
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan:
Prestige 
The Dark Knight Trilogy
Inception
Intersteller(2014)

All Great Movies and none of them were bad hopefully this is good too."
zSWdZVtXT7E,it's not a black hole. they are bending space. its called a warp drive for a reason. where they go though is up to the imagination.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If some group wanted a united world government, what might unite the world under them? What needs such large requirements that only convincing and control of the people to such an epic extent as this can be able to accomplish it? Shades of 1984?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"no i just have a bad feeling that this movie is setting it self up for a sequel cause that im coming back with the black screen makes me doubt that this will be in one movie

zSWdZVtXT7E,"""God is in the rain"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,been starving for some really good Sci-fi movies. Nothing good since star wars and bladerunner.

zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well, there have been studies on black holes and there are even real videos of what it looks like when something enters a black hole and comes out the other side, and let me tell you, it probably wouldn't be good for you unless you wanted to be stripped down to your basic molecular level and then shoved back out as raw particles. You would die of radiation before you got anywhere near it though."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The first time is saw the trailer i thought it was a new start of the Batman trilogy
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murphy's Law: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong at the worst possible moment.
Yeah he named you after a bad thing."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We must confront the reality of interstellar travel"". Hope to live to the moment when space agencies around the world will pronounce these words as a part of joined venture and global collaboration and hopefully such undertaking will be a part of mankind's expansion and not a desperate decision due to some immediate danger."
zSWdZVtXT7E,lol if that was a black hole you know he ain't coming back XD
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mackenzie Foy is apparently a younger version of Murph. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,in nolan i trust
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awesome movie want to see it so bad 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Jonathan Nolan (writer of movie) went to Caltech (very prestigious university) for four years to make certain the science behind this film was accurate
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oscar Nomination for sure.. Probably wont win, because it's Sci-Fi.. Damn!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"An engineer going into space? Isaac Clarke, anybody? :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow that looks promising. I'm looking forward to it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:55 : Looks like some beautiful gravitational lensing. :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,This definitely looks like Chris Nolan's most ambitious movie yet. Impressive stuff so far. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,To all of you who says that this looks boring. 95% of the footage is from the 20 first minutes of the film. This is the first trailer (apart from the teaser). The movie is in post-production and most of the special effects are uncompleate. The next trailer will probably show more space scenes.
zSWdZVtXT7E,What a joke ... how stupid do they think we are?
zSWdZVtXT7E,awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,in nolan we trust
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow. Now this is how to do a trailer. Hollywood should take note. This was so interesting and thought provoking and it left me knowing close to nothing about the plot which is so rare nowadays. The people actually complaining on here about how they know nothing from this trailer make me sad and are the reason why trailers nowadays give way too much away (cough Amazing Spiderman 2 cough)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I would classify this trailer as ""high-end ambiguity""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Armageddon : Part 2
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Guys, the song used in this trailer is called:

""Evey Reborn"" from V for Vendetta, by Dario Marianelli"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is what I think the plot is: 

Humanity faces extinction from starvation. The sun has become too unstable to sustain life on Earth for much longer. However, a wormhole has been discovered, and Earth's governments decide to send a team through the wormhole to discover where it leads to. If it is safe, humanity will begin a mass exodus through the wormhole. 

The main character is an engineer and a pilot, which makes him suitable for such a mission. He has two children, a daughter and a son, which he loves very much. He leaves on the mission unwillingly, promising his children that he will come back. 

However, years has passed. The main character's children has now grown up (Jessica Chastain plays his grown up daughter, note the similarity between the two) and Earth is in much more dire situation. The main character and his mission has not returned and the children starts looking for answers. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,This an assimilation of many movies/ and story lines
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Love how it's attributed from actual possible theories, but yet scary"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did they just fly into a black hole?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Meh.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Lemme guess... when Maconauhey et al. comeback the kids have already grown and died. Ah, the paradox!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When it's all said and done, Nolan will go down as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The man is an absolute genius and he really teaches us what it means to dream big."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So epic!
zSWdZVtXT7E,u never been on the moon.  stop to dream guys. :-) 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ready for Christopher Nolan to blow my mind once again.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does it mean any thing
zSWdZVtXT7E,Eager Nolan Fan!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks insane! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I appreciate that the trailer doesn't give away the entire plot. That's a lost art to most producers, it seems."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What happening
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sooo many stupid people in the comments...
zSWdZVtXT7E,What is the soundtrack behind this? I feel like it was in v for vendetta? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"God damn, so many stupid people commenting trying to act smart.
Guess what, scientists worked on this movie too... it's science fiction, but I'm sure they know more than you!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,So they fly their spaceship into a black hole why?? If they can make it to the nearest black hole they could make it to the nearest star system with planets MUCH MUCH easier and faster...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its got to be a wormhole. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This reminds me a little but of the Across the Universe book by Beth Revis.
zSWdZVtXT7E,2014 space odyssey :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,apparently its based on Kip Thorne's work and i read some of his theories on black holes and now i have the biggest headache so im just going to wait for this film to come out
zSWdZVtXT7E,is the music playing from V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm not getting why there is so much hate on this movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Humanity is a virus (essentially), we move from one place to the other using up all resources in the area until it is deplete, after that we move onto another area and do the same. So basically this movie is about a virus spreading from one planet to another since it's used up the current planet it's inhabiting. Nice."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow! And I thought Godzilla was going to be the film to beat this year!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Does anyone think they may be traveling to the future, well PAST the expected ""death"" of mankind to then return to Earth to perhaps repopulate it? Perhaps the twist is that they run into another intelligent lifeform that has evolved, possibly cephalopods or apes? Maybe like Planet of the Apes? Sorry if this sounds stupid, haha."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope this is another smart movie watched by stupid plebians like Transcendence was. Let alone space travel, mankind isn't even ready for a movie without an obvious villain, plot and end. Ah well. Cue the thousands harping on this trailer for being clichèd environmentalist BS while pretending to be intelligent. The movie's not even out but there will always be someone who somehow knows everything about it already."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So...Maybe a dope sound track by Aerosmith? It would complement the movie nicely. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks awesome really looking forward to this movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Honestly people, Nolan is a genious. Don't offend him talking about Batman or comparing this to Gravity before watching the movie. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Not really feeling pumped about this sci-fi movie, seems more like a drama... then in the last 10 minutes they shoot to space."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I like how persons are already critiquing the movie before they saw it ...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just like Blood Diamond was a massive jab at DeBeers. Interstellar is a massive jab at Monsanto.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have to see this. Nolan never fails.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks interesting.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nothing special at all. And the mannerisms of this actor are just so irritating.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm getting the feeling that this might be a film based around philosphical/existential themes, to make the viewer think, than it is about the story. It worked for True Detective, so it can work for this."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wormhole not black hole PEOPLE!
zSWdZVtXT7E,MS Chastan I bet you is future murphy.
zSWdZVtXT7E,reminds me of a modern 2000 A Space Odyssey.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wonder if Jodie Foster will appear and ask him if he believes in God? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wonder if he's true to his word and comes back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,That score is just mesmerising.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Do you guys realize this trailer is only supposed to be like the first 15-30 minutes of the movie? It's not gonna be boring and all talking... Chill.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey is definitely going to die at the end of this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I am so psyched; Christopher Nolan, Matthew Mconaughey, space! I have high hopes for this film!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Blue and yellow.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Super filmul asta
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Black hole? Wormhole? ...Alcubierre Drive?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not interested. Christopher Nolan can do way better than this...!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Again another epic soundtrack from Hans Zimmer 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Don't do it. Don't read the comments. Just trust me.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It's not a sequel to Gravity as some people are referring. Gravity is about an astrounat who has trouble while she's in space. However, Interstellar seeks to take you on the voyage and explore the phenomenom that is space, applied with wormholes and time travel. Plus, there are a lot of surprises the trailer doesn't show. You should all know Nolan by now. This movie will be epic."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This reminds me of that movie ""Contact"" with Jodie Foster. You should watch if you guys haven't seen it. Came out in 97"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Michael Caine is in this movie apparently, i hope he does more than just speeches"
zSWdZVtXT7E," Nolan is an awesome director,, Mcconaughey is an amazing actor,, add to that the near end of the world scenario and space travel and I've just let off a noise only dolphins can hear."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's the song?!?!?!?!
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's Nolan it will be epic he can't make nothing bad just you wait until Batman comes out and saves the planet!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"First off, this looks like it'll be a great movie. I love sci-fi stuff. I'll definitely go see this.

Second... Oh my goodness. What is the name of the music. It's incredible, and I've heard it before, but I don't know the name. Someone please tell me so I can listen to the whole thing. ;_;"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ohhhh, this is looking impressive!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""The world doesn't need engineers, we didn't run out of planes and television sets. We ran out of food."" that is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Especially when it is the premise of a movie about going into space. Maybe we should confront the reality that bad writers make millions on bad movies for uneducated people."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Too soon, too soon to re-use that soundtrack. V for vendetta still fresh in the mind."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"we are extremely blessed to be living in a time where christopher nolan is on top of his game. this man creates masterpieces, thank you christopher and Jonathan nolan for showing the world how epic movies are made."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks great!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anne Hathaway will ruin the movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"You guys seem to be forgetting who directed this! It´s obviously Inception style or even Memento I can see that. And worst, cause space and time traveling plots are already confusing without having Nolan there....
The only way I can be dissapointed with this movie is if I come out of it having understood everything in the first watch."
zSWdZVtXT7E,At 1:49 you can clearly see that Nolan got an inspiration from Kubrick's Space Odyssey. :) The same minimalistic design of a space ship in outerspace.. nice
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This could be a great film and I am very much looking forward to it. I find it amusing that there are already trolls exclaiming that climate change is a hoax/Agenda 21 nonsense. In all honesty I would suggest that we just don't engage those people. If facts and evidence aren't apart of your intellectual lexicon then the conversation is over. In any case, we will have to leave this planet one day in the future if we are to survive as a species. As we speak the Andromeda galaxy is careening towards our Milky Way, asteroids pass within earths orbit constantly. We are always under threat of extinction. I look forward to a day where we are able to maintain individuality yet also think as a SPECIES, instead of being trapped within the ""nation"" complex. 
Bravo Chris Nolan! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,3D?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"We already know that the plot is something along the lines that due to overpopulation, the Earth has run out of food and scientists discover some sort of wormhole. At the end he says ""I'm coming back,"" which leaves the implication that a large part of the plot will be around this promise he makes to his daughter. I have a feeling we will never see what is on the other side of the wormhole. I think most of the space voyage will be on the way to the wormhole, leaving space for some sort of plot twist at the end of the movie. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone else notice this is the exact same house and corn field from Looper?  first thing i noticed after having seen that movie multiple times on a flight from australia...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this one of those random comment sections where even the dumb comments get tons of thumbs up? I don't understand why this happens
zSWdZVtXT7E,"People, it's a good thing Nolan moved away from Batman. Let's see him with original work to truly understand how gifted Christopher really is."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Don't mind me, i'm just here for my daily view. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan ... Zimmer... it could only get better if they threw in Dicaprio so he dies at the end for no apparent reason and makes it a blast 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"d[-__-]b the trailer and the soundtrack blew my mind.

I've got goosebumps."
zSWdZVtXT7E,this movie is probably going to make gravity look like a joke
zSWdZVtXT7E,"one of the very few, exceptional movies of this year (2014) that I am really, eagerly waiting for ... I know for sure that this is going to be *deep*, huge, and potentially even changing (hopefully at least MANY, if not ALL) humanity/mankind's 'outdated' Mindset and way of thinking..!

in *Christopher Nolan* I/we trust...!

-from Indonesia -"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think its good that the trailer doesn't give away what its all about. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"MICHAEL CAINE

The rest of the movie looks good, too."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Damn this seems so good! The combination of the scenes and the music from Hans Zimmer gives me goosebumps while I watch this trailer!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Gosh, I'm dying to watch this. Nolan is my favourite director, so please, don't dissapoint me (I'm going to change my pants now)."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is the most accurate space warp ever shown in a feature length movie. Ever.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It's actually a worm hole, not a black hole. Look up the movie on IMDB, the entire synopsis is there."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well, we'll see how it goes."
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's nice to see a good quality science fiction film being made that doesn't pander to the broadest audience but rather pushes the bounderies and puts the science back in sci-fi like in movies such as The Abyss & Contact.
zSWdZVtXT7E,could you say me the music name?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Honestly when I saw the title I thought it was a ""Gravity"" rip-off."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"My guess of the Plot:
Earth is dying because of the actions of Human (maybe some experiment /invention lead to this.). The concept of time travel has recently been discovered/. Time travel could be done via the wormholes. The scientists of Earth send some of the Astronouts back into time so as to warn the people of that time frame of the dangers their actions may bring."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If the human species, or indeed any part of the biosphere, is to continue to survive, it must eventually leave the Earth and colonize space. For the simple fact of the matter is, the planet Earth is doomed... Let us follow many environmentalists and regard the Earth as Gaia, the mother of all life (which indeed she is). Gaia, like all mothers, is not immortal. She is going to die. But her line of descent might be immortal... Gaia's children might never die out--provided they move into space. The Earth should be regarded as the womb of life--but one cannot remain in the womb forever,
Frank Tipler"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this the new Farscape movie?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did anybody notice that around 1:40 (Jessica Chastain) is using Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) jacket? I'm just assuming that she is Cooper's daughter. Casey Affleck will be Cooper's son in the future. I think there will be some kind of time travelling or something like that. CMIIW
zSWdZVtXT7E,"well, atleast the trailer is not THE movie. its a good trailer/teaser"
zSWdZVtXT7E,MUSIC BY HANS ZIMMER !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Father and daughter relationship is much like the movie 'Armageddon' vibe...anyone felt that?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hope this is not another ""First Contact"" where everything builds up to absolutely nothing. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"EVE Online, the movie..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is most likely going to be the new 2001 a space odyssey
zSWdZVtXT7E,my most anticipated movie by far. As well as deliver us from evil.
zSWdZVtXT7E,that gravitational lensing tho
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Matthew is literally in his prime at the moment, this will be another oscar nomination!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music is by Dario Marianelli, its from the V for Vendetta soundtrack ""Evey Reborn"" you're welcome :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think Nolan should work again with composer David Julyan, Hans Zimmer it's starting to get me bored."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"To me it looks more like the batman films, than like Inception or his previous films."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta song!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,He'd then realize that time is a flat circle. lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,Saw this trailer in Imax 3d....trust me it leaves you with goosebumps that you just won't get when viewing it on a computer screen
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie was better when it was called, The Astronaut Farmer..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey looks just as wooden here as he did contact!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"From this trailer, aesthetically this already looks like a sci-fi classic in the making but will have to wait and see."
zSWdZVtXT7E,SPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCE!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is what trailers should be like! not giving too much away but enough to make me really interested. not knowing the plot but still looking amazing is forgotten by most trailers these days that just show a montage of the entire film and give away what happens.
zSWdZVtXT7E,why is this trailer so focused on corn crops and family issues? i thought this was about INTERSTELLAR?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That is NOT an interstellar travel, that's a pointless alphastrike on a blackhole."
zSWdZVtXT7E,If people are asking about the soundtrack... refer to V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,great casts especially Matthew Mcconaughey but i have a bad feeling that this movie will turn out bland and boring.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really wish  Nolan can write dialogue that normal human beings say.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It's from Christopher Nolan. That alone makes me intrigued to go see it. From a Batman fan, I'll go see a Nolan film in an instant without knowing much about it. Nolan films never disappoint."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"How is it that all you people cannot tell what the plot is? Is society really becoming that thick?!?! Have we now reached a point where if a movie or television show doesn't specifically spell every little tiny detail out for you...you miss the point...or think it sucks? I swear I am living through the movie ""Idiocracy"". The plot is simple and completely explained in the trailer. The Earth is going through an ""end of days"" type disaster where we can no longer grow food, our main character has seemingly wasted his life on becoming an engineer (since the world is ending who needs engineers), everybody in the world is attempting to figure out how to save the world, humanity finally makes the decision that we aren't supposed to save the world, we are supposed to leave this planet behind and explore the cosmos, to do this...humanity's last surviving scientists come together to solve the problem of interstellar travel (hence the name ""INTERSTELLAR""). I got all of this from that one trailer as this is the first I have seen it, and I have not read anything about it. I can't wait to see how dumb this planet has become in 10 years time..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"As a huge Fringe fan who is deeply fascinated with the engrossing tale of parallel universes, this story of humans discovering a wormhole and embarking an unprecedented mission to travel into it is a real treat for sci-fi junkies."
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that black sphere thing they fly into meant to be like the mass relays in mass effect?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have to be in a certain mood to watch this - seems boring
zSWdZVtXT7E,im going to like this but alot of idiots cant understand complex scifi movies alot of people are not open minded about the situation in the film itself thats why scifi films are considered b movies
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wondering black hole with massive gravity is coming toward our solar system, and it's disrupting planet's rotation around our sun, therefore causing dramatic weather change.  I guess the main character is chosen pilot to do something to this black hole before it's too late.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,so many pointless hate comments. I really hate the general audience (face palms)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Expecting something as great as Inception and Dark Knight. Trailer seems familiar but the movie will be fresh and surprising. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan's IN trilogy: Insomnia, Inception, Interstellar"
zSWdZVtXT7E,It‘s low cost，yes？
zSWdZVtXT7E,+1 for Dario Marianelli
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Revolutionary SF = square-jawed super-daddy engineer hero who lives on stereotypical 50s style farm and other Americans are the only hope to save Earth... Hollywood SF never evolved beyond Heinlein juveniles, did it?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"'Mankind was born on Earth' No, it wasn't. (I hope the system wasn't built by Human beings, cos it'll fail within a few years)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,A movie like this without without Tom Cruise? I didn't think it was possible.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Possibly the next space movie to top Gravity?...
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta OST
zSWdZVtXT7E,music from empire earth 2 intro (-.-)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If the movie means to meet a blackhole, it is not sci-fi, it is a fantasy movie..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,That's the music from V for Vendetta!!! Evey Reborn! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan just keeps getting better..Hope this one rocks!
One thing is for sure the background score would be awesome for this movie.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that girl who played as Reneesensesamee in Twillight?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"JEBAĆ LOGIKĘ! Biuro w którym mają odprawę/obgadują strategię, mieści się w hali, w której montowane są rakiety i jest oddzielone wielkimi wrotami... FUCK LOGIC!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan always make nice movies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow, everybody is so anal and calling this movie ""propaganda"", this is just a passion project for the director. Also, why so much negativity on this movie about casting choice's and this movie being ""Over hyped""? Why must we judge before a movie comes out. And to all the negative people on here you and I both know you'll be waiting in line opening weekend to watch this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I bet matt travels through space really fast and then comes back to earth and his daughter is grown up and he's the SAME AGE smash cut to black
zSWdZVtXT7E,What movie is that music from?  It sounds familiar.
zSWdZVtXT7E,it is a nolan film so it will be awsome
zSWdZVtXT7E,Do they actually leave earth or is just a melodrama about the potential of interstellar travel?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"BLAH-BLAH-BLAH-GLOBAL WARMING*WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH!!!       Same old political agenda, I'm not going to spend any of my make believe carbon credits on this absolutely pointless movie.  At least the Godzilla movie has more fact than this piece of fiction."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think this film will destroy Nolan`s reputation. But who knows, he `d never disappoint me before"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I gotta say  i love sci fi  and i'm extremely excited about this movie , but 2 thngs are dissapointing me :
1- that the trailer intro starts by saying that ""mankind was born on earth"" , this alone tells you that the writers of the script didnt do their research well ,because chances are that mankind didnt start here on earth.
2- this plot seems almost like prometheus , they start off good but then they leave you hanging cause they have no clue what to make the sequels about...
but in overall i can't wait  lol."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well christopher if our planet ran out of food we would try anything to get food dont you think?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"yes, i hope movie will be good even without stunning music theme"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"1,502 people are on crack!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Uh, Can someone tell me what exactly the ""premise"" of the movie is actually about?
 "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone who thinks this will be anything short of spectacular is a gigantic cockroach.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"ohh the feels, must watch"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This isn't about climate change. The movie takes place after the next world war and there is wide spread disease and famine due to crops failing and the planet being ravaged from the war. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"He says ""im coming back"" twice. this is some deep deep shit."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like more global warming propaganda crap
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Mcconaughey, Nolan, Hans Zimmer.......Wet pants !"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The Logical Space Travel:

Humanist Perspective:
1) Man is not designed for space
2) Too many unknowns along the way
3) We don't have the speed to travel even at 1% of light speed
4) Life is too short
5) We are environment sensitive beings we only breathe oxygen
6) Can we resupply when get to our destination when we find it unsuitable?
7) Why jump overboard when the rate of survival is way higher than the option?
8) If people has survive then why cant we? or someone is really eager to go somewhere for they can survive without us humans

Logical Perspective:

1) Death is a rebirth
2) Multiple dimension do possess higher possibility of success
3) You cant die anymore if you pass the test
4) 1 day in spirit world last a 1000 yrs
5) You can travel at the speed of light even faster
6) you dont need food
7) You are compatible which world or galaxy  you want to go
8) you can bring friends
9) no need to train
10) You dont have to sleep and miss the views
11) you can warp back if your needed instantly
12) endless option/ why bring our limited designed body that can not conceive beyond its limits?

The former is more a folly sci fi and a bad twist what is practical, isn't it? Or someone cant really wait to get off the solar system for the punishment they done to mankind? And why help? We already paid for it, the tech and all the pain and suffering. Go figure :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Chris Nolan + Hans Zimmer = Perfection
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Obviously they're going to Namek to get the dragon balls and wish all the Earth's problems away.  At least, that's my take on it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks fucking terrible
zSWdZVtXT7E,"GAH, FINALLY... figured out where I've heard that music before.

It's in V for Vendetta. During the scene when Chief Inspector finch has a feeling of... what all he can... see happen. Wow, that sounds stupid out loud.

Oh, trailer. Cool."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks AWE-some!
I do believe Nolan needs to work on the art of compression, however :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans zimmer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This film looks likes it's going to be awesome!! 
Expect some twists in it though, just looks the type of film right?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love that black hole so much
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is obviously an outer space alien..
zSWdZVtXT7E,@krithika Lakshmi 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Really Excited for this!!!. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Can't say wow, can't say awesome... just curious as to what it's about..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hmmm, looks intelligent and to be a fairly original concept. Therefore I'm going to needlessly judge this movie and critisize it based on the trailer before I know anything about it. How disappointed I am because of this interesting trailer. They should instead put out another comic book movie or 73 with some more explosions.  It's all I can tolerate these days. How lame you would try something different. I'm going to paint cat whiskers on my face and pretend the world owes me something. As you were."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So Matthew's a big shot?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone know what the song is? It's brilliant!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this movie worth a $40 drink at AMC......hmmm 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""whatever can happen, will happen."" Multiverse hint?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The song is called Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,so in near future India will drone spy america. a nice hallucination.
zSWdZVtXT7E,i want to see this film so hard
zSWdZVtXT7E,Maybe we deserve to die here if we wreck the planet. There's a good plot.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It's Christopher Nolan:you don't find out ANYTHING about one his films unless HE wants you to. I CANNOT STOP watching this trailer.its awe inspiring and frightening at once,and very effective use of the score from ""V For Vendetta"". All I can say is.... HANS ZIMMER."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks alright, nothing more."
zSWdZVtXT7E, the same music from V for vendetta hehe 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite store on the citadel!"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,i got massive goosebumps when the credit says 'director of inception and dark knight trilogy'. i think my computer will explode if it includes the prestige & insomnia.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"with every nolan film, you learn a new vocabulary"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I only hope the whole 'weather killing us' premise is just an excuse to make a good, hard scifi movie about interstellar travel and the drama will be limited to the latter."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Another pretentious movie from Chris Nolan. That's not saying it'll be bad, but Nolan is trying desperately to be recognised as the next Kubrick. Also I'm calling it now that at least one female lead will die in Interstellar. Nolan likes killing off female characters if you hadn't noticed!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow WOW WOWWWW!!! Can't wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,A trailer that says nothing. FINALLY!!!! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Master Bruce, go out there...and save them."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wanna see this
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks good! Looking forward to this (:
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The ship with the ring aroundit looks similar to the warp drive concept first proposed by physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994 that manipulates space-time in order to achieve faster than light travel, an idea currently being tested by Harold White at NASA."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow it looks really good. The music. And man the narration. Gotta see this!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"In the end of this movie they will discover a new world and wait for it... they will call it earth,  meaning they weren't on earth to begin with.. like the twilight zone."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love this trailer, at the end of the trailer it leaves us where he is going into the wormhole, and it looks like he survives but the world is more fucked up. Big question mark how is Matt going to fix that problem. WOW can't wait to watch this movie!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'd be more onboard with this movie if they dropped Matthew...
zSWdZVtXT7E,This evokes Queen - '39
zSWdZVtXT7E,shut up and take my money
zSWdZVtXT7E,we must confront the reality ... that nothing in our solar system ... can help us.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Movie trailers should be like a bikini - they should reveal what is important but conceal what is vital.  This trailer doesn't give away much at all. Instead it forces you think. What is Interstellar about? Another Contact? Planet of the Apes? Space 2001? I doubt it somehow.  In an era where Hollywood blockbusters basically tell you the whole story in the space of 2 minutes it is a welcome relief to watch a trailer that is a bikini.
zSWdZVtXT7E,That better not be how the movie ends him going into space travel smh
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm down to watch Matthew McConahay(Spell check) abandon his kids and die in space... :/ sounds exciting... NOT.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When at 0:19 he said, ""The World Doesn't Need Anymore Engineers"", it seriously broke my heart..
i mean why i wasted my 4 yrs in college for???"
zSWdZVtXT7E,SPACE BATMAN!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,What does the Trailer tell us?  NOthing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have so much faith in this movie, Nolan challenges his audience to embrace critical thinking and always brings the best out of his actors. This script has been touched by both Spielberg and Nolan, Interstellar will be more then a movie it's going to be an event."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for vendetta soundtrack 
zSWdZVtXT7E,meh... underwhelmed...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Damn..
zSWdZVtXT7E,nolannnnnnn
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Interesting. What is it about? Well, the future, governments and economies across the globe have collapsed, food is scarce, NASA is no more, and the 20th Century is to blame. A mysterious rip in spacetime opens and it's up to whatever is left of NASA to explore and offer up hope for mankind.Mainly based on the scientific theories and script treatment of renowned theoretical physicist, Kip Thorne. Interstellar is set to be released in late 2014. SPACETIME.....AWESOMENESS!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Alternate realities, they gave it away"
zSWdZVtXT7E,God damn it Nolan!! Another great movie!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope this happens to you people. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sadly as a sci-fi fan i'm afraid it won't have enough science fiction for a space movie. The trailer is all about his family and how bad life on earth is or whatever you only get like 10 seconds in space.

I wish someone had the courage to make a new big budget space opera. I mean we've had a couple of flashy remakes, star treks and things like that but i can't really think of anything set in a new universe in the last 10 years."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks amazing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did anyone else notice batman flying the bat in the background just before they went through the worm hole??? Awesome!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,i don't get it. but i think its nice..
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is most likely going to be the greatest movie of all time.
zSWdZVtXT7E,basically its about a future storyline of corn being the only growable crop left on earth.they basically go on a voyage to find more resources. by exploring wormholes.  traveling through time. what im curious to see is where they actually end up..... bcuz his kids are grown up in this trailer and they were burning the corn fields..... so something must have taken place for that turnaround
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan We Trust.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well, this looks depressing."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan/McConnaughey - yes plz
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks totally confusing with too many 'chick-flick' personal side issues.
zSWdZVtXT7E,WHAT IS THE GOD DAMN MUSIC
zSWdZVtXT7E,SOMEONE TELL ME THE NAME OF THE MUSIC
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow this looks pretty great :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone els notice the V for Vendetta music subtly playing throughout the trailer?

Or is it just me. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cannot even speak...I've watched this trailer 10 times too many lol..this is going to be breathtaking 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm so pumped for this. Chris Nolan is the best director out there right now.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why can't Nolan just make a sequel to Inception?
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's good to see someone finally following in Dr Arroway's footsteps. They did say we'd take another in time.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer tells me nothing about the plot of the movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer gives me goosebumps, cant wait."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Curiosity got me and I read the 2008 script for this online.  This trailer shows maybe the first 20 minutes of the movie.  The rest of it is...amazing.  Like 2001 meets Avatar.  There is a LOT of action, and being a Nolan brothers movie it's a blockbuster for smart people.  I really, really hope they don't dumb down that script."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Now that I know the entire story in 45 seconds I would appreciate to watch the ending now.  Although, overall, I'm irritated as shit that previews provide this much of the story.  What happened to enticing people to watch the movie rather than enticing them to just watch it all again but slower just so they can know what the ending is?  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does Batman come out?
zSWdZVtXT7E,was that a black hole?
zSWdZVtXT7E,">people trying to claim black holes aren't inter dimensional dark matter that has such an intense gravitational pull that it flings things in between light. 
Black holes are operating on a superposition because it takes quantum mechanics to understand it. Therefore creating a singularity."
zSWdZVtXT7E,">people trying to claim black holes aren't inter dimensional dark matter that has such an intense gravitational pull that it flings things in between light. 
Black holes are operating on a superposition because it takes quantum mechanics to understand it. Therefore creating a singularity."
zSWdZVtXT7E,got a feeling time travels gonna be involved 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"One thing's for sure, they have the Christopher Nolan team. familiar faces"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks awesome - but I fear that most of the movie is the lead up to the end of what we see at the end of this trailer :( I  hope I'm wrong.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer is beautiful
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan We Trust!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Everyone that is saying that this is another stupid sci-fi movie for sure never read something about Kip Thorne theories, so please don't give your opinion if you don't know."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Somebody is screwing around with the 'likes'. I've tried to like comments. Doesn't work but some people have hundreds of likes? Somebody's hacking something...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dang. This is the first video where I've seen nearly every comment with over 10 likes.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am pretty sure they are saying earth is running out of food and they need tonget it from another solar system i think?
zSWdZVtXT7E,what is the music I know I heard it somewhere before﻿
zSWdZVtXT7E,what is the music I know I heard it somewhere before﻿
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is going to be MAGNIFICENT !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Space rust
zSWdZVtXT7E, #interstellarmovie  
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ran out of food? Gosh they tried this scare tactic in the 70's - With current farming methods we can feed 30+ billion people - imagine what we could do if we created more farms and with newer farming methods and GMO's we could create food to outlast anything and feed everyone
zSWdZVtXT7E,i sense and alcubierre drive...
zSWdZVtXT7E,All the physicist such as Neil Tyson Degrasse state that Interstellar space travel is impossible using liquid and solid propellants that produce the hot gases that produce the thrust to escape earth's gravity. Looked like the rocket Wooderson was in was using just that form of propellant. Guess I'll have to check the movie out to find out how interstellar travel is done.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I AM ABSOLUTELY SOLD! This looks absolutely amazing. Hope they make it scientifically accurate, but they are willing to dive into the real unknown, and use their creativity, while putting it on the big screen and risk the profit. I didnt understand anything from the teaser, but now it makes sense. What I dont get is that they go into a black hole, but they are in our solar system...and there isnt a black hole in our solar system..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,From the directors of these movies...and the cast too
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks BORING!!  Kinda gives me a Contact feel.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"From my point of view I always see the same topic..The problem ""the last days of the earth"" The solution ""go and look for a new planet"" not only on Films, in the books also,It seems that they try to impose that idea on the head. Is there another way?  Why not we fix our planet...for example..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Reminds me the movie contact,hope it would be great as that movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""I'll be back...when you are 185 years old."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer was before godzilla!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music is from ""V For Vendetta"" - Evey Reborn"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We are not meant to safe the world, *dramatic pause*, we are meant to leave it.""
Sold !
I'd buy that for a dollar !"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This will sink or swim depending on what's on the other side of that interstellar wormhole, warp-drive thingy. They got physicist Kip Thorne of University of Utah consulting on this, so if it flops or underwhelms, Nolan's credibility sinks.
But then, sometimes I start up Dark Knight on DVD just to watch his peerless direction of Batman zooming through the streets and that shopping mall on the Batpod."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yes yes! think like a species! Leave Earth behind! Leave your humanity behind! You too can become a gaaaawd! New Age bullshit.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is the sci fi film we need. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone else realise that it's the same soundtrack from V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan: Best Director 2014
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If you just watched this trailer, you have to be pretty darn stupid to not know what this movie is about. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,The prestige of the Prestige trilogy. whoo
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is this the first ""horrible and Worst Movie"" by C.Nolan ?. Well I will only because of is history movies (Prestige, TheDarkKnight, Incepetion). Because this Trailer its so simple and plot Revealing ... but whatever... maybe i get a surprise Mindblowing ... but like i say ""maybe"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,can't wait for the movie AND it's soundtrack!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Damn, does that child actor seem to be terrible in this.

Besides that, I'm looking forward to this. Appears to be a return to cerebral scifi. 

Also, what if the ending is them going through the warp? You don't get to actually see where they end up? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Huh.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan, McConaughey and Zimmer. Nice."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""God is in the rain"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I know that I have listened to this song somewhere else. I know it's from a movie, nevertheless, I can't quite remember which. Anyone care to give it a shot?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I was sent here by a man who had his head exploded
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Song: ""Evey reborn"" from the film ""V for Vendetta"". You are welcome ^^"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nothing like being Entertained to Death is it?  Like most movies there is an underlining thought that THEY want us all to think about which isn't good because this is to cause people to link movies to reality and think on the underlining lies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,meh..
zSWdZVtXT7E,IT LOOKS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie looks awesome! And it's Nolan, so I know it'll be the best movie of the year."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Only one fleeting shot of Anne Hathaway in this trailer. I wonder why?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"In the end, was he going into a black hole?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,About damn time. I been waiting for a sequel to Contact for ages.
zSWdZVtXT7E,What on earth is the plot?
zSWdZVtXT7E,what the hell!? Train the astronauts to be farmers not the other way around!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The astrophysicist in me was very happy when I saw the gravitational lensing around the ringed spaceship because I thought that they would do an accurate representation of an Alcubierre (traditional ""Warp"") Drive. The astrophysicist in me was subsequently extremely disappointed when I saw that it was a wormhole.

<sarcasm>Soooooo original.</sarcasm>"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awww yeah! Warp drives!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"some of these comments are so stupid, it's like people don't get that this trailer is probably only showing the first third of the movie. OBVIOUSLY most of the movie is gonna be about what happens after they go through the wormhole, they just don't want to spoil all the cool stuff because it's probably really good "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"in other words we humans are like CANCER !!!

WE CAME WE SAW WE DESTROY !!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks great.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So is this a reboot of Contact?
zSWdZVtXT7E,That looks AWESOME
zSWdZVtXT7E,That score.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why does it say music by Hans Zimmer it sounds identical to Dario Marianellis music in V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Movie plot, Quantum Singularity(Black Hole) enters our solar system which due to the very high gravity will alter/change Earths climates/seasons, etc, planned space mission to used experimental technology to enter said 'Black Hole' and alter Earths past to save our future.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was ANYONE else expecting a burned man walking out of a burning building raising his hands and yelling with that rising music playing? Cause it happend in V for Vendetta. O_o
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is this trailer made by ""The Onion"" ? Looks like it employs every visual and plot cliche in existence."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This had better not be another damn ""Contact"" movie!! Remember that?!  Ughhh!  2+ hours of my life I'll never get back!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,what..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A Space Odyssey, Part 3: Exiled from Earth"
zSWdZVtXT7E,How exactly does humanity 'run out of food'? Agriculture too complicated for a space faring species? I can build and operate the most complex machine in the world but i can't put seed in dirt and pour water duuuh...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Strangely enough, this reminds me of another Matthew McConaughey movie also done by WB, Contact (1997)."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like another really stupid plot designed to tug the old heart strings
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Disappointed to see an anti-engineer slant to the movie. At a time when we are trying to encourage children's interest in science, technology, engineering, and math."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"as much as I love this trailer, you can't base your plot synopsis off of it. With Nolan, chances are this is basically all footage from the first act, maybe some from second. From what was released about the movie in the brief synopsis they gave, I think It is going to focus more heavily on the space travel and worm hole time travel. They said it is all based on actual research done by Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist"
zSWdZVtXT7E,such an awesome soundtrack. Anyone know the name?
zSWdZVtXT7E,One way or another Nolan loves to recycle all his actors...
zSWdZVtXT7E,THE PLOT HAS ALREADY BEEN REVEALED! IF YOU WANT TO SPOIL IT THEN JUST READ THE SYNOPSIS ON IMDB! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We must confront the reality of interstellar travel""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,either you die a good director or you live long enough to become yourself a crappy one
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is just like Alien!
zSWdZVtXT7E,So looking forward to this! Christopher Nolan is a genius... I've never seen anything by him I didn't enjoy immensely. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Perhaps an interesting movie but the fact is we aren't going to another star system. The closest one (Alpha Centauri) is 4.37 light years from earth, meaning to get there (let alone return), it would take more than 4 years to get there traveling at the speed of light (which is impossible to go that fast). That's 25.6 trillion miles! Imagine paying taxes to support that, we can't even afford the space shuttle anymore."
zSWdZVtXT7E,my favourite film of all time and it hasn't been released yet.  Now thats interstellar
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Mission to mars 'looked"" like a great trailer too.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait! Nolan movies are the best in Hollywood right now!
zSWdZVtXT7E,The release date of this is November - that's over 5 months away.  Why even bother to show a trailer at this time?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The trailer makes the movie seem so mysterious. It reminds me of a movie from the 90's called 'Contact', which is funny because McConaughey was in that, too."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"stopped watching midpoint, trailer reveals too much"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"kinda reminds me of Contact, lame all the way until the very end and even then the ending sucked but was still kinda cool..that machine and all."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is best
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is that the farm house from ""Man of Steel"" or ""Looper"" or ""The Book of Eli"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer's going to ROCK the soundtrack for this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan's name is everywhere...r people watching this movie for the movie or for Nolan? Anyway, the trailer intrigued me, and the idea is depressing...Humans weren't meant to live on Earth and how we destroyed the entire planet, will watch on release.

Also, I know and respect Nolan's reputation, he's up there with Peter Jackson (LOTR, King Kong, Hobbit), Greengrass (Bourne Trilogy 2&3)."
zSWdZVtXT7E,That dam Violin or Viola makes me want to cry every time.
zSWdZVtXT7E,if only mcconaughey was likeable. will skip cause I hat his face.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it me or this is the V for Vendetta OST???.... (Eve Reborn song from V for Vendetta's OST)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Everyone saying ""I don't understand what the movie is"" are dumbed down by the new age of movie trailers. A movie trailer is supposed to lay out the basic concepts of the story. Which this one does. It does not spoon feed it to you. A trailer is supposed to make you want to go see the movie to find out what it is all about. Not to give away everything in the story so you can understand the whole movie. Trailers give away too much lately. I am glad this one keeps some secrets."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta thats what the music is from! I really had to solve that mystery 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think they stole the v for vendetta soundtrack
zSWdZVtXT7E,What song is this? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The first trailer was way better, i would've given an oscar for it, and i'd run to see the movie, now it just seems to be another bs sience fiction movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"At last! the genetically inferior acknowledge their inevitable fate! Only those who know the difference between Man,and mankind will understand my words...Space is unkind to strangers."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So I think I've seen the whole movie allready.
zSWdZVtXT7E,warp drive!!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,What movie was that music in?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"FINALLY... a movie that ""looks"" realistic with all those DUMB cgi effects.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan + SciFy = MASTERPIECE
zSWdZVtXT7E,"also...nolan casted mcconaghey BEFORE dallas buyers club and true detective had come out.

he casted him based on his performance in mud. again...nolan being prophetic."
zSWdZVtXT7E,˙˙˙ɹǝlᴉɐɹʇ sᴉɥʇ ɟo uoᴉʇɐɹnp ǝɥʇ ɹoɟ ɥʇɐǝɹq ʎɯ plǝɥ ᴉ
zSWdZVtXT7E,"is jessica chastian the little girl grown up?

they look very similar. i think when matt says he's coming up, he really means it. his kids will have aged but he still looks the same."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks really promising.

like the relationship between matthew mccounaghey and the kids, that will be important part of movie.

if you compare actors to sports athletes, matt right now is the most in form actor in the world...hes in his absolute prime. this will be an incredible movie, very smart casting choice by mr nolan."
zSWdZVtXT7E,weird because it looks like the music of V for Vendetta and the movie comes out the 5th of November﻿
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks pretty cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love it  when the trailer doesn't spoil the plot.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks like it is going to be the greatest movie ever made!
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks stupid.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I always thought that the point of a trailer was to NOT give away the plot, this trailer succeeds in doing that and the movie seems to be very interesting. I'll definitely watch this when it comes out."
zSWdZVtXT7E,must use my time machine to watch it ASAP!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is a brilliant director. All his movies so far are probably the smartest and most intelligent American big budget movies ever made.
zSWdZVtXT7E,It seens a lot of people don't find the plot in this trailer but its most likely that they will put out more trailers in the future.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that Britta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I expect for the best movie ever. Don't let me down PLZ
zSWdZVtXT7E,I felt good to see McConaughey looks fatter from Dallas buyer club.
zSWdZVtXT7E,He ain't comin' back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Holy Moly !
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i'm kind of put off by the premise. i mean, they're trying to save humanity, they can't think of a way to grow food in whatever adverse conditions they have? the guy's an engineer, engineers can't think up ways to grow food?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Guys come check my YouTube channel out
zSWdZVtXT7E,Flashbacks of 2001: A Space Odyssey
zSWdZVtXT7E,WHAT IS THE MUSIC !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't want to judge a book by its cover. This looks interesting and it has great actors but it does have the makings of being simultaneously underwhelming and overrated.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Civilization: Beyond Earth: the Movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan's attempt at making ""2001: A space odyssey"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,2014: A SPACE ODYSSEY!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"people are mad they couldn't figure out the story/plot…yet get mad when trailers reveal everything. This trailer is great, the trailer gives just enough and doesn't reveal to much"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ok so has no one considered the  possibility that they might run into some aliens or some shit aint no telling whats out there think bigger people 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music. V for Vendetta much?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What I love about this trailer is that it doesn't give away the entire plot of the story. Sure, you know that it's about interstellar travel and you know that the world is running out of food, but you don't know why they're heading into space and what they're going to find whilst they are there. These are the best kind of trailers; also, we'll be able to head into the cinema not knowing what to expect. I can't wait for this to come out! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i think in the end of this movie the guy returns to earth, but it is a parallel earth "
zSWdZVtXT7E,SO MANY FEELS..
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Matthew We Trust!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone else notice that almost all comments have  about 100 like lmao this is weird
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey in space... Im sold!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is the type of sci-fi movie I wished someone would make.  With Christopher Nolan and great actors, it should be awesome. I thought Inception was a fantastic and introspective take into the intricacies of the dream world and subconscious. Can't wait for this one!  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,"How many times have we been to the well of great SF movies only to be left with a vague sense of disappointment when our expectations are never met? Even the great movies like Blade Runner (the real version) snuck up on us from behind without the ubiquitous foreplay required by today's publicists and media management teams.

This. This looks like our best hope for a long, long time.

No pressure Mr Nolan, no pressure whatsoever........ "
zSWdZVtXT7E,This will probably be quite the mind fuck.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Damn, I hope that ship had a warp bubble protecting it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,it will be best movie ever
zSWdZVtXT7E,Meh.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The famine and all that is really just a red herring, if we found a wormhole in the future we'd travel it even if everything was peachy here. What's gonna make this story is what we might find, and what the universe holds for us."

zSWdZVtXT7E,"I LOOOOVE the way the trailer was made. Pretty much nothing has been revealed about the main plot of the movie. Way too many trailers nowadays show basically the whole movie. This only shows a few space scenes, and the introduction to the movie - nothing else."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This makes me so fuckin' hard
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler Alert: He's not coming back. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Humanity, fuck yeah!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"@The Ayala Factor Just to clarify, they're not going into a black hole, their space ship essentially creates a tiny one, or a singularity, to warp space-time, which allows for faster than light travel. Nothing could survive a black hole, nothing made of matter at least, the gravity of a black hole would rip the ship and its occupants apart down to the individual atoms. This movie is based on real scientific theory. And though some black hole theories account for the possibility of traveling vast distances of the universe if one went through it, all one has to do is account for the sheer gravitational power of the black hole beyond the event horizon to know that its just not possible. Hope that adds more clarity to you."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ooooooo
Most awaited film of the year."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow this looks cool.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Love it
zSWdZVtXT7E,That looks amazing!

zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't believe Nolan left Batmen for these movie :(

That being said, the movie seems to have great potential."
zSWdZVtXT7E,why have they used 'evey reborn' from v for vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,He comes back as the Green Lantern. (Just in time for the planned Justice League movie)

zSWdZVtXT7E,Another hype stupid and shallow sci-fi.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks good am I right. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm pretty sure I'm going to fall asleep during the movie. zzzzzzzzz
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer makes every film better
zSWdZVtXT7E,The real problem with this movie is that there are 6 month before its release. It is far too much.
zSWdZVtXT7E,holy shit this looks amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,So I am going to guess this will be a 2:30 hour long film and about 1:45 of it will be all talking......
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Nothing in our solar system can help us?""  Really?  Ice from comets?  Metals and minerals from the asteroid belt?  Helium 3 from the Earth's moon?  Power from orbiting solar collectors?  All that seems much more achievable than a mission to interstellar space that seems to be such a long trip that the astronauts require suspended animation to make the return trip. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,After watching this trailer I have no understanding of the plot whatsoever. I personally do not recommend this trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's about time somebody finally made a movie which is the (at least spiritually) successor to Contact. Let's hope that this one is better executed. Interesting that McConaughey is a main character in both.

zSWdZVtXT7E,Reason why the world doesn't need more engineers is because humans don't know when enough is enough. We kill everything we touch and we spread mechanical terraforming like the plague and before we even realize it our own mother earth is left in desolation and destruction. Sooner than anyone thinks we will be forced out into interstellar space the same way a child who has reached the proper age (18+) to leave their beloved home but sadly not for the same innocent reason .Great movie can't wait to see it :D Nolan will do fantastic with this one.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Jonathan Nolan with the script again.  Christopher is so loyal.  So, expect another intricate, multi-layered, interwoven, convoluted film.  Just sayin'."
zSWdZVtXT7E,woah...too bad matthew mcconaughey stars in it

zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is the film that I have been waiting for. Just like McConaughey's character says, ""I'm coming back."" Nolan is coming back to bring the world a film that will bring back hope in the filmmaking industry as his line of previous films have proved. This installment to his embodiment of stories seems to be the most personal of his and the most emotional of his. This is the first trailer that has emotionally moved me. I never thought a trailer would ever have that potential, but I was proved wrong. Until November, I shall wait patiently..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"humans are destructive to the earth. a world like earth, is meant to be save!!! why are we so destructive ??? and then what are they going to do when they discover another planet with life? fuck it up with their pee brain minds. and build more fucking nuclear bombs,wars,racism,greed,slavery etc.they should be a movie called rotten humans who fuck up!! the earth."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan and Matthew Mcconaughey? Count me in

zSWdZVtXT7E,"The movie itself looks good, I'll probably watch it, but I feel the message it appears to convey is absolutely essential.  Whether by our own hand or the capricious chaos of the greater universe, this planet WILL be uninhabitable someday, and the sooner we can bebop the hell out of here, the better.

Remember, children: money is a toy, politics are a game, but life is all we ever really have."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Dear god !! please don't let this be all too serious, doom  & gloom , pretentious, dark inception movie !!!  Oh, wait , it's a C.Nolan's movie, so all prayers are wasted..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I cant wait for this :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is ridiculous...Why don't we put some more actors in space...How about we have Sandra Bullock join them and bring George Clooney back who is saved by aliens who have used a wormhole to reach him..and then rocket up Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and do Ocean's 14:Space..they steal the American flag off the moon...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"great trailer and great music but of course thats not a strange thing because the music is from this other great movie '' V For Vendetta""!!"

Also does anyone know what music it that plays during this trailer...have heard it before and love it and wanna know what it is."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The V for Vendetta soundtrack is a nice touch.  Was he flying into a black hole at the end there?

zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hey guys, I know self advertising is bad, but can you take a minute to look at my music? Thanks!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,You can see Jessica Chastain on 1:40 in the trailer and she is probably his daughter all grown up (assuming on red hair) so I assume that this movie will have many plots which will go on not linear way and in the end of the movie we will just stay like whoa. Seems like a movie that many people will talk about this autumn. Just gotta like intelligent blockbusters. Way to go Nolan. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,this should be a good one!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow did that look like a brutally long propaganda flick with 5 minutes of space tacked on the end-yeah ill pass.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Say man, you got some food?... it'd be a lot cooler if you did."

zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sooo it's about locus that destroy one planet and move on to the next, nice!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,everything about this looked awesome until I saw Ann Hathaway was in it.

One thing I realized is that (correct me if I'm wrong) the music in this trailer is called Evey Reborn and was used in my favourite movie; V for Vendetta.

Very excited!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"meh, back to playing combo burger advanced"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"As a massive fan the Dark Knight Trilogy and True Detective in which Mathew McCaughney deserves recognition this is a film i'm very, very excited about. The musical score is immense as well"

zSWdZVtXT7E,"As long as no one has asthma in this movie or it has will smith's son in it then I'm good :). If it takes a semi-realistic approach to this this could be really good. That being said, this movie could be really bad if this gets screwed up."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is why i enjoy nolans film's.Because he makes film's that make you want to think because there so dang cool and the story;ine's to mos tof his film's are at a area were you have no choice but to use your brain.And i enjoy this oh so much.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Look, a wormhole, lets fly a spaceship through it and hope that the outcome solves our food crisis.........."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is interesting!  Me thinks it reflects the thinking of certain VERY well connected individuals.  As to the mode of their thinking... that is for the benefit of all mankind or for their own benefit, well that is unclear.  I must admit though, they are human and when it comes to sacrifice we humans tend to adopt the attitude ""better you than me""!"

zSWdZVtXT7E,I came here expecting a Gravity ripoff only to find out this is something entirely different. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"OMG , this is exceptionally good !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't understand, if the point of the movie is to start over some where else with the best of the best of humanity, then why in the hell wouldn't you bring the best of the bests children along as well???  

Dead mother, single father hero, saving humanity and coming home for his children, good tear jerker but entirely impractical.  Now if they don't make it...  and we get to see the hero's kids grow up to try again, and actually succeed, that would be a hell of a story."
zSWdZVtXT7E,It deserves 533 444 222 142 views.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Interesting concept for interstellar travel!  But.....the earth will never run out of food.  I saw a lot of burning cornfields in this preview.  But.....there are other sources of food, both animal and vegetable.  Not all of the Entire World's food comes from midwestern cornfields!  If you live in a vacuum and have never travelled the world you might think that what Hollywood says could be accurate.  But it is not.  The whole premise behind Interstellar Travel should be to explore other worlds, gather resources, and build space-faring communities, not to escape the planet Earth.  If you were to dispose of the intriguing scenes where they are in space, what you are left with is a movie that sounds like the Kurt Russell flop: ""Escape from L.A."", only on a global scale.  The Earth is beautiful my friends, and there are many many people who are actually succeeding at keeping it that way."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan...... Beyond Godlike.....!! _/\_
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:53 Anne? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sure, brilliant idea Warner Bro's Studios! Lets just take planet Earth and do what we have always done with things we don't want: throw it away! Trash it! So we can move on to the next thing or planet in this case, and throw it away when the time comes too!

I don't think enough people understand just how valuable something like a planet like Earth is. Is it any small wonder we haven't found any other planets out there readily capable of supporting life? Planets like Earth may be the most valuable thing in the Universe! It literally mean the world to you, and me.

Ugh. The premise of this movie makes me sick.

Heads up though; we are indeed short on engineers, companies can't get enough of them! What we do have too much of though is PEOPLE and I don't think there will be an end to how much food we can salvage/produce.

Nonetheless this looks like an entertaining and interesting movie. Its just the idea's that its based on that makes me worry."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Off to Alpha Centauri we go...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks cool. Will probably watch it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:16 who's that?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want to see this!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Abe, get out of Dans head! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,The thing I really love about this trailer is that despite it being 2:17 long I would bet that almost all the footage shown is in the first hour of the film. Nolan knows how to whet our appetites while still saving all the best stuff until November. So damn excited for this one!
zSWdZVtXT7E,the solution for mankind is to go inside a worm hole and find another planet to colonize?
zSWdZVtXT7E,it sounds like Thomas Newman is doing the soundtrack 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like a really cool movie! :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,The CGI kid in Twilight ! She's real !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"In spite of all the wishful thinking, mankind is going to die on earth. The fantasy that we can use this world up and somehow flit off to another one is part of the reason why."
zSWdZVtXT7E,From Nolan? No Steven Spielberg was the one who came up with the story.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The bubble thing doesn't look like a black-hole, it resembles more a warp drive.. because the universe in front is expanding and behind is getting smaller, creating a bubble.  ﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oh I hope this trailer only covers the first 30 minutes of the movie, those kids look very very boring... I don't think I'd like to sit through their trials and tribulations on a dying earth for half the movie while their daddy is busy having amazing space adventures the over half."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Pause exactly at 2:07. That's some of the worst animation I have ever seen in my entire life.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I've  had   dreams  about  traveling to  another  planet  since  I was  a  kid  . Some  are  so  real that  I  feel  like  I  was  there .
This movie  has  some excellent   people  behind  it   and  should  be  a    great  film ! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,nice
zSWdZVtXT7E,Casting Matthew McConaughey to star in a remake of Contact? Bravo Nolan
zSWdZVtXT7E,"November???
Nooooooooooooooo"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks incredible. Far too long of a wait though!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Actually the movie plot is believed to involve time travel and alternate dimensions which sounds epic though the trailer looks beautiful. I am curious to see how much the final film continues after the ship warps at the end. Any guesses what happens after that?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Interesting... I wonder what kind of world the characters will discover!
zSWdZVtXT7E,i was lead here by a man named Dan
zSWdZVtXT7E,cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Please, Nolan, don't let this be like Trancendence. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks intriguing is it a possibility
?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,lol nolan is using mcconaughey now
zSWdZVtXT7E,"GIVE IT TO ME, NOW!!!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"God Matthew, would some diction lessons be such a terrible idea? This cowboy twang is getting so old."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Something tells me this isn't going to be a good film for Mathew McConaughey to be acting in. Seems like space movies just isn't his style, but I could be wrong tho."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hope for Matt to lead mankind to a new home planet!!! yeahhhhhh
zSWdZVtXT7E,Am I the only one here that sees this and thinks... Meh?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Be greatful what this trailer has given because majority of you people complain about how most of the trailer just spoil everything for you.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Song name ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think that the bubble is a Alcubierre Drive!
Does anybody agree!?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Flying into a black hole.
Seems sensible."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie looks really god, idk how nolan does it, but he does. Also i'm so happy to see mackenzie foy in new stuff"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Recycling the Vendetta soundtrack? Really? You have Hanz Zimmer at your desposal! Looks great, though :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The movie looks amazing! I can't wait to for it to hit theaters.
zSWdZVtXT7E,1.00 it sounded like Mathew was using the Dark night voice. LoL
zSWdZVtXT7E,Trailers using music from other movies bothers me. The music is from V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,that ball thing freaked me out so much when i first saw it...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Having a friend who already read the entire plot, and saying the trailer only show 5% if the entire movie and all the footage in this trailer is only the first 25 minutes, he said you have no idea whats coming for you. Plus Matt Damon i in this movie, and he is rumored to be some kind of alien﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really hope this movie is as good as sounds and looks. I am afraid I have to big expectations though
zSWdZVtXT7E,Evey reborn <3
zSWdZVtXT7E,michael caine's voice is almost as good as Morgan Freeman

zSWdZVtXT7E,matthew mcconaughey is terrible
zSWdZVtXT7E,Interesting
zSWdZVtXT7E,"1:50 Cannot help but be reminded of 2001 A Space Odyssey. But, this'll actually be good. I'm sorry, but Gravity was just stupid as hell."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is a great trailer and I'm certainly gonna watch the movie - it's by Chris Nolan, there's no way this could be bad! :D
*For those who are searching for the music:* It is ""Evey Reborn"" by Dario Marianelli from the ""V For Vendetta"" movie soundtrack. You can find it on YouTube. :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,stellar cast and a stellar trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Mankind was born on Earth.
Mankind destroyed Earth.
Will Mankind go destroy other worlds...?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Now would be a great time to find a wormhole, damn 6 months of waiting Nolan Brothers you better damn blow my mind with this, i'm counting on you guys :D <3"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Lovely
zSWdZVtXT7E,I get goosebumps every time Michael Caine is speaking
zSWdZVtXT7E,Signs + Knowing = Interstellar
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wish Nolan would stop writing some much exposition in his dialog. It just seems silly and takes me out of it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So much of Sci-fi coming. I am feeling great. Long live the Universe.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I like Potatoes 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It looks good, but they're showing off too much in the trailer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,YEAAAAAHHH
zSWdZVtXT7E,cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,it reminds me of The Last of Us story
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm wondering if the little girl with the red hair as the daughter becomes the women with the red hair in the middle of the burning cornfield? which would mean that Mathew M. goes into space pretty early in the movie and maybe comes back when she's grown up?
zSWdZVtXT7E,He is sooo not coming back. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Can someone tell me what the soundtrack to this trailer is, it sounds so familiar."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks amazing
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain!
zSWdZVtXT7E,not enough godzilla
zSWdZVtXT7E,DAMN IT ABE!
zSWdZVtXT7E,good consept
zSWdZVtXT7E,Make this work Nolan
zSWdZVtXT7E,Zzz
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Black Hole part had me sold.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I wish that spielberg had directing interstellar.. Nolan is very intelligent , but not really legendary .. His best movie was TDK and sure inception.. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,alfred youre using bruce wayne's money for that ship.. :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan+ Sci-Fi, I'll need a change of underwear in the theater."
zSWdZVtXT7E,mackenzie is all grown up..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For all those who are saying it's a worm hole, it is not. It's depicting warp drive as proven mathematically possible by Miguel Alcubierre. We use immense amounts of energy to compress space-time in front of a craft and expand it behind it. This make faster-than-light travel possible because we move space-time, not the space craft."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This music (which I'm pretty sure is from 'V for Vendetta') is absolutely amazing...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"With Christopher Nolan as director, I don't think there's a way for this movie to fail"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I heard that everything in the trailer takes place in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,If nothing else Nolan's movies are always unique
zSWdZVtXT7E,Saw this trailer at the Godzilla screening and i am even more excited for this movie!! Alright Alright Alright!
zSWdZVtXT7E,...meh
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is going to be good.
Thank GOD for originality, I'm fed up with these frikkin REMAKES.....oh wait, who's directing? ....nevermind........lol"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hmm, don't know how I feel about this."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think they would find a planet where life can grow, but it ends up being Earth-either the past or the future... just saying"
zSWdZVtXT7E,prequel to elysium 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is genius!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wouldn't be surprised if little murph grows up to be Jessica chastain considering time travel is a theory in physics.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I like pie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I really love the depiction of space travel in this trailer, but the existence of family drama in this movie just freaks me out. Why in the world did Nolan insert it here? The family composition (little girl, her elder brother and main protagonist) reminds me of Spielberg's TWOTW, but casting here is worse, unfortunately.

TL;DR: The sci-fi part of this movie is very promising, but the focus on family drama worries me a lot."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A film critique made a good point about Christopher Nolan's films. What Nolan does best is make films about complex subject matters and ideas, and make them appeal to a mass audience. So he adds the spectacle of the grand score, visuals and performances, but doesn't treat his audience like idiots. While we have films like Transformers 4 coming out which  looks like just a series of explosions, Nolan will probably give his audience something to engage their minds with. :) "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I arrived after witnessing someone get their face exploded.
zSWdZVtXT7E,i already decided that i want to watch this movie the moment i watched inception (i watched it way later than i should have) this movie need not trailers to be honest. the trailers are meant just to relief the fact that its six months away hahaha
zSWdZVtXT7E,Feels like I just watched the movie 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks good but will Interstellar satisfy sci-fi movie folks? Too much is revealed in the trailer. Plot? ... To find another Earth like planet for humans to destroy!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oh yes! OK so I think they travel through a wormhole and end up at Earth in the past (or future) and they tell the people there what has happened and try to fix the Earth, or maybe Multiverse and they end up in a universe where mankind was smart and protected the Earth, and they decide to stay there since everyone they know and love is there but in a different universe. Or if it is in the future, maybe mankind has discovered a way to travel at the speed of light or predict wormholes accurately enough to return them back home. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So, it's The Grapes of Wrath meets 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Yeah, I'm in."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So it's a sci-fi movie that spends most of its time on a farm....... How very signs. So not looking forward to such a muddled convoluted story.. ""the solar system has nothing to help mankind""..... What because the acres and acres of corn fields shown through out this trailer suddenly stopped working.... What tripe. We don't even know if there is life on any other body in the solar system. yet Nolan says nope and the whole world can no longer manufacture food... Tripe, pure tripe"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think I just cried, amazing! 10/10
Just what I want the move to be!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nothing original on the surface here; looks like ""Contact"" meets ""Armageddon"". Maybe it's standard Hollywood fare, or maybe it'll surprise me. Will have to wait and see."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I just hope Nolan Gets an Oscar  for this movie its gonna be awesome if he did

Loved this movie from the moment i saw the teaser trailer :D "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"well educated, a pilot AND an engineer? man, this guy's got everything"
zSWdZVtXT7E,nice
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Can't wait to see this movie. That black hole lurking in the solar system, at 1:55, gives me goose bumps."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just finished reading the script. All I have to say is WOW... So many crazy unimaginable things happen. Very trippy. Very cool.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I could be wrong but the spaceship looks like a model rather than CGI. That is very cool.
zSWdZVtXT7E,when sets foot in mainland china?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Danny2462 sent me here, and I am glad he did. This looks AWESOME"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan, the director behind the Batman reboot and Inception, doing Sci-Fi film about space travel... This looks epic! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,it's crazy how quickly viral movie trailers become...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Happy to see that the science concepts are done correctly.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The begining of STAR WARS :-)
zSWdZVtXT7E,HE GAINED ALL KINDS OF RESPECT FROM ME FROM TRUE DETECTIVE
zSWdZVtXT7E,What I am seeing. Is that a Singularity?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan!!! I hope this movie win him an oscars
zSWdZVtXT7E,"2:08 you can't end a movie like this with him coming back. He's going to die up there, no doubt. Spoilers. Yeah that's right, the spoiler-warning came after the text. Take that bitch!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can see this being a bit like Stanley kubrick's 2001: A space odyssey 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Bibical tales aside, from a scientific angle in order for humanity to survive he must take to the stars and I looking at human trends that tend to be gradual. The Apollo mission to the Moon was taken in steps before landing. So i predict one hundred years shall not pass before the Moon then Mars and beyond that time frame a gas giant moon."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth"" Coming this Fall."
zSWdZVtXT7E,op
zSWdZVtXT7E,Finally saw the black hole/wormhole up close!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Holy crap, this movie is going to be amazing"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Because the only thing more awesome than Matthew McConaughey is Matthew McConaughey IN SPAAAACE!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i cant stop watching this trailer, if anyone knows the name of the song, pls share it, couse i like it very much."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow.
zSWdZVtXT7E,=))
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't believe it, the movie of my dreams is coming true!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Are Illuminatis preparing us for something ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I found it fascinating.  Oh how I wish I was younger.
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This score is so incredible.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The house and farm at 1:18 looks identical to the one used in the movie ""Walk the Line"". If I am correct, then Hollywood should really stop reusing the same sets in such an obvious manner - it really cheapens the experience."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks like  great film, don't get me wrong, but the trailer kinda felt depressing. I'm gonna go and watch the lego movie trailer to cheer up!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,For everyone who is STILL wondering who made this score it is: (Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn) from the soundtrack of V for Vendetta:) you're welcome.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"First off- Not even going to try to guess what the movie is about. Nolan NEVER reveals the plot of his movies in his trailers. The Prestige's trailer was a complete misdirection. The Batman Trilogy always showed us images but never revealed the plot. And Inception was who knows what (though it did imply Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to steal an idea rather than implant one). So I'm just going to wait and see

Secondly- The music is phenomenal

Third- Haha. So many engineers are getting offended. Relax... it's a movie"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Reminds me of rats leaving the boat.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Heightof epicness..Great Nolan. Hope you will work with Salman khan soon
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""The world doesn't need anymore engineers. We didn't run out of planes and television sets. We ran out of food.""

*epic facepalm*"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Soundtrack from 1:25-to end. I'm sure i heard it somewhere before. Anyone knows the name?
zSWdZVtXT7E,nice
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks sick!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Signs 2?
zSWdZVtXT7E,anne hathaway & matthew mcconaughey WITH christopher nolan WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
zSWdZVtXT7E,What an amazing trailer... and presumibley the film!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"
Looks like Armageddon, Gattaca, Wings of Honneamise and 2001 combined.

Should be an excellent cerebral work of sci-fi and could be the sci-fi movie of the year"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"God that looks so good, can't wait for this to come out.
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Good movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,I was expecting reapers to cleanse the world and star anew 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Really? Yet another sci fi film tainted by the environmental whack job agenda? 

"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Milan,mcconaughey,anna hathaway --> worth to wait it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for vendetta music. -_-
zSWdZVtXT7E,This gave me goosebumps that can last a day!
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's stunning! I'm watching it over and over again :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie will help explain why we are here. What our purpose really is. I believe I have found the answer to both those questions. I am finding it hard to find the right people who will listen with an open mind, and are willing to accept things on faith."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Best trailer all year and not a single gunshot nor fight scene lol.  This is skill.
zSWdZVtXT7E,+++
zSWdZVtXT7E,Appears to be just another american melodrama. Yawn.
zSWdZVtXT7E,In rust we trust
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sounds like Adam Strange
zSWdZVtXT7E,+++
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome!  And the trailer music is from V for Vendetta   :-)
zSWdZVtXT7E,I feel like this is gonna be like Contact(That movie with jodi foster) . Most of the movie will be on earth and only the end will be in space. Then there will be a weeeeirrrd/random/come up with your own explanation type of ending.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not impressed...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"meh, good concept and inter stellar travel is the best investment. no perzzas though. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan? Yeah, I think we're in safe hands. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks like a prequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Maybe it's about another one of man's great evolutions, when we learned to conquer space rather than being restricted to Earth. Plus, Matthew McConaughey is in it, so it's a must-see for me XD "
zSWdZVtXT7E,seems really interesting
zSWdZVtXT7E,It seems like it's going to be REALLY GOOD... but then my other self tells me it's going to have 80 minutes of talking and 10 minutes of action.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Look at all this chit chat.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Look at all this chit chat.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This kind of movie has been done several times before. When are they going to do something truly original? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like the concept, seems like a smashing idea for a movie.  But i think its gonna be a bore-fest with 15 minutes of decent special effects to wake you up about 90 minutes into it.  Heavy heavy  on the cornball family stuff and light on the expensive special effects.  And probably about 45 minutes too long.  I'll wait.  i dont get movie channels on cable so maybe red box if the wife is nagging me to rent something ANYTHING and theres nothing else.  I could be wrong hope i am.  But i quit the $15/person theatres 3 years ago and haven't looked back  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is Nerd³ ok?
zSWdZVtXT7E,still not as good as gravity
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher nolan made some pretty damn good movies. But man. I really think that this one might be a flop or not enough to touch his other achievements, He's best off directing action sequences along dark gritty characters in the mix. I'm really tired of seeing a plot of where all resources on the planet runs out and humans have to do something to find somewhere else to go. YAWN! why don't they make some giant prequel that leads on to another movie to where we make contact and relations with different species of aliens that have different cultures from one another. Make a galactic space opera ! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks cool, I want to see that bed of water part how do they sleep in that?... cool.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music anyone?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want to watch this right MEOW.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The pictures and the scenes looks good but I don't understand the story 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Love how anne hathaway is in this haha XD
zSWdZVtXT7E,the music from v for vendetta 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Memento. Insomnia. The Prestige. Inception. The Dark Knight Trilogy...and now this! Everything Christopher Nolan directs is amazing pieces of filmmaking! I have really I high hopes for this!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hate to be the bummer bunny here, but this is not an original concept by a long shot. Inception was, and as a result not much else mattered -- people were captivated.

This film doesn't have the same going for it. The concept has been done and done again. Rather than riding on a gimmick or original idea, this film's success rides on everything else: acting, screenplay, cinematography, etc.

It also helps that everyone thinks so highly of Nolan. If this were by another director most people would just yawn. I don't think it will be anything special, but it would be great to be proven wrong. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,This can't happen soon enough.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm comming back... FOR YOU
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If you're gonna do a trailer, try not to use a great soundtrack from another movie, I can only think of V for Vendetta watching this! And such a dramatic moment from the film as well! Okay, comment aside, trailer is meh, idea seems good, but only if space takes major part of the film, otherwise boring and same-old, same-old."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't understand why I am stuck in this page and repeatedly watching this trailer!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan we trust 
zSWdZVtXT7E,What did she say at 1:17?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I know it's awesome as it's a Nolan movie, there's no doubt.

But why does the trailer suck?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks like black hole.... interesting :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was always a guy that loved astronomy and space. This movie looks like it will be amazing. It looks like they are using real world problems like droughts (like what's happening in the mid-west.) It also seems like they're using the ""Manifest Destiny"" angle (kind of) in terms of us expand through the star.  I'm hoping no aliens for the most part."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ahhh Micheal Caine was waitin for Alfred to show up :P :P
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope there's going to be more to the plot of film than just - Man goes out into space in search of a burger.
zSWdZVtXT7E,You can barely tell from the trailer that Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are in it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie better not be like ""Contact."" (ala Jodie Foster)

People will be so pissed and/or Shyamalaned if it is..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alright alright alright lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone know whats the name of the bgm for this trailer? It so epic!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it just me or did the music in this trailer sound extremely similar to the music in V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:40 something tells me that is the little girl all grown up
zSWdZVtXT7E,"At 1:41, Jessica Chastain is wearing the same jacket that Matthew McConaughey wears in the first half of the trailer.  What could this possibly mean?!  Wink wink."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"You know what, I use to think Morgan Freeman had the voice of God but now after hearing Michael Cane's epic speech. I believe he has the voice of God."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The moment when the most anticipated movie of the year's story is revealed. Looks quite interesting! Anyone turned off by this trailer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I literally can't handle this anymore!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that the farm from looper?
zSWdZVtXT7E," (✓) Christopher Nolan
 (✓) Sci-Fi
 (✓) Apocalypse

11/10 would see."
zSWdZVtXT7E,NNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! look out for Jake Busey!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:41 is that Murph all grown up and sexy?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If anyone is wondering, the song is from V For Vendetta, its called Evey Reborn."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was so interested in the premise of this movie when reading about it. This trailer sucks, though.

""Murphy's Law"" is trite and silly. The rest didn't provide evidence of anything new or exciting in a film. shame."
zSWdZVtXT7E,After Dark Knight Rises i have my doubt
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolans midas touch me thinks
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolans midas touch me thinks
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Awesome trailer
The movie will be much better!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Kudos to Hans Zimmer once again.
zSWdZVtXT7E,why is there so many views for the trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just one question - how is he going to come back if theory of relativity will make time different
zSWdZVtXT7E,hu
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Open the pod bay doors, HAL!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What once was the colonization of countries, will soon become the colonization of planets. Let us see how long it takes for us to realize that no, this planet will not infinitely provide for us. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan's Law: At least two actors from the previous film have to be in the next film. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Isn't that the girl that played Bella's daughter in the last Twilight movie? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"so it's a cross between ""Children of Men"", and ""2001""?...."
zSWdZVtXT7E,That chill through the spine watching the trailer..... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yawn...another time travel movie from Hollywood.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Seriously, is Michael Caine in every one of Nolan's movies? It's almost as bad as Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter being in almost every Tim Burton movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Humans the the fate of the earth are forever tied. We will never leave. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,YES please! Looks like the kind of movie I wish Spielberg still made but even better that its Nolan!  i'm there!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it just me or Jessica Chastain = Adult Murphy???
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have the ending to this movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"From what I've heard, I agree humans not meant to die here, so the plot looks like, local farmer saves mankind by becoming the pilot of a mission to save Americans. I noticed a man made destruction of the environment too.  Then there's the sci-fi.  I'm sorry.  Once we get outside the Earth's magnetic field, we're toast.  Regardless."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Seems like the best space movie to look forward to this year. So far.
zSWdZVtXT7E,im come back
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So, engineer w/ kids, worlds in trouble, send him to space to find suitable planet or to some unknown destination via black hole? I feel like I've just witnessed 2/3 of the movie from the trailer..I just dont see appeal in this trailer...but hey Nolan is directing so maybe it will be 3hrs long and not everything was revealed here, because Nolan is boss and hes going to shut ppl like me up"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Remember remember, the 5th of november."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Hey, are you going to another Solar System?""
""It'd be a lot cooler if you did."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If you really want to do something, you'll find a way. If you don't, you'll find an excuse."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Jessica Chastain? I'm going to see this!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that score the same that was in the Dark Knight...? Really?
zSWdZVtXT7E,How can you guys like it if you haven't seen it yet?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Best movie of this year.
zSWdZVtXT7E,http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Fashion-Women-zara2014-Top-Quality-Brand-New-Skirt-set-cute-female-print-long-sleeve-sweet-dresses/1825063605.html
zSWdZVtXT7E,oh god let me guess the last one scene they jump into some FTL is the ending right?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think that Matthew Mconahaugh (butchered his name) will warp space time and end up back at Earth in the PAST just in time to see himself take off in the rocket. That one scene where his daughter is holding hands with somebody is actually HIM after he came back to earth. Also the line ""I'm coming back"" is repeated many times throughout the trailer so I think it's a hint to say he'll come back in the past. Just my theory "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cant wait until the HISHE of this comes out
zSWdZVtXT7E,Neon Genesis Evangelion is going to sue somebody.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"To everyone who liked this: watch the trailer for Civilization: Beyond Earth
same plot, beautiful trailer as well :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,was that a wormhole at the end?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really hope a good portion of the movie is in space
zSWdZVtXT7E,it looked as if they were traveling into a black hole? am i right? or a worm hole of some sort? im lost on the story line
zSWdZVtXT7E,The drone was spying on the near-by rocket launching facility. I'm betting there is going to be spy on the mission or another rival mission.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ill watch it just to see Anne Hathaway in a space suit.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was hoping to get another glimpse of that Hans Zimmer soundtrack in this trailer, but ""Every Reborn"" by Dario Marianelli is a great choice. Love that song, really works for the this interesting trailer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,there's no morgan freeman :(
zSWdZVtXT7E,Moviegasm.
zSWdZVtXT7E,They ran out of food because these idiots thought it would be better to build more houses than have farmland. How about we make a movie about that?
zSWdZVtXT7E,is cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That's right Abe, leave this Earth like you would a factory that forces your kind to work and produces consumables made from your own species."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like they couldn't find one single way to be creative
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm guessing there is more to this movie than the trailer might suggest. I think we might just have the set-up here. Unlike a lot of other directors, I think Nolan would rather leave the main plot out of the trailer. I'm super excited to see where he takes this. ON a side note: I think the bubble is a representation of what has been theorized as what might be created by some kind of warp engine, as a distortion of space. I don't take any clues about this being an Interstellar wormhole as people might be thinking."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't care what some people say, I hold Nolan as great director and as one of my biggest inspirations."
zSWdZVtXT7E,omg the white savior of the world once again yeah.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,November? That means this is going to be a good enough movie to be an Oscar contender.  It's going to be a long Spring and Summer waiting for this to come out...
zSWdZVtXT7E,soundtrack?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cant wait for November... Nolan is my favourite
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks very interesting. I will be very pissed if the movie ends with them going through the wormhole and nothing being explained.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm definitely going to watch this
zSWdZVtXT7E,A sci-fi from Christopher Nolan..very eager to see it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If the person who did Inception and Dark Knight did this, I can't wait!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks sorta like gravity but 5x better....
zSWdZVtXT7E,hmm
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It doesn't really matter if it's good or bad, you're all going to watch it and it will make a billion dollars anyway."
zSWdZVtXT7E,THIS MOVIE
zSWdZVtXT7E,"1. I just watched this very awesome trailer of the movie ""Interstellar""
2. Then proceeded to read the comments
3 Started Liking a LOT of peoples comments below.
4. Time to cont. my journey on Youtube for the rest of the night"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I smell 2 Golden Globes, 3 Academy Awards, and 1-2 Oscar's........just saying"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here. Such a powerful line."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hope this is gonna be better than gravity.
zSWdZVtXT7E,i just wonder how many laws of physics this film is going to break lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks pretty damn boring and I love Sci Fi
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Just some speculation:

""Anything that can happen, will happen.""
Murphy's law, definitely the main theme. Related to alternate realities, alternate versions of Earth.
""I'm coming back.""
Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow travel in time, as well as in space. He's attempting to come back to Earth, but at another time.
""I love you, forever.""
Emphasis on 'forever'. Silly observation, I know, but how will Matthew's character love his daughter forever?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The selling point is finding out what happens after they enter the black hole.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm just gonna take a guess and I think he's going to come back after his expedition only to age a couple years while everyone else aged 40 to 50 years 
zSWdZVtXT7E,i just pooped my pants...i can't wait for this film! #interstellar 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like it could be cool, but why are they reusing music from V for Vendetta here? (Evey Reborn)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hi
zSWdZVtXT7E,Bet they don't hit the wormhole until at least an hour into the movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""From Christopher Nolan"" 


best part."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew Mcahnoughey is a fantastic dramatic actor. I really like that he began expanding his range beyond hot stoner recently
zSWdZVtXT7E,Omg. A few trailers this year have left me speechless but interstellar. Omg. Omg. (INAUDIBLE AWESOMENESS)
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:18 You see that watch on her right hand? That might be significant later on....can you guess why?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is what you define as a classic trailer. It shows you enough to keep you interested to see more. People these days want the entire story within one trailer. Why?   We've grown to be so spoiled with plot details within these modern trailers that we can't even appreciate ones like this. smh
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks promising! This trailer goes well with The Dominoes fall track from V for Vendetta. :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am coming back!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love sci-fi
zSWdZVtXT7E,Isaac Asimov would be proud.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks so stupid.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goddamn this looks good!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Chris Nolan thinks he's smart for mentioning murphy's law 3 times in a 2 minute trailer. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,That older brother making that murphy's law joke was utterly lame. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sort of ironic (I believe the definition fits). That a ""Mega Corporation"" is making a film about how we need to leave Earth to survive, as a species. Yet it was those same ""Mega Corporations"" that plugged most of the industrialized nations, capable of colonizing space, into debt; causing those nations to suspend plans to colonize other celestial bodies.

I can't wait to see the 'Plot' of this show. It's already full of so many holes."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Seems like another ""Elysium"" kind of story. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If anyone's curious, the song is ""Evey Reborn"" from the V for Vendetta OST"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Plot: People take a paralysis journey through a newly discovered worm hole, in hopes of saving mankind... Pretty sick right!??"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did anyone else come from nerdcubed?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm coming back
zSWdZVtXT7E,ehh why matt?
zSWdZVtXT7E,November well gosh damn
zSWdZVtXT7E,Insane i cant wait to see this !
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm stoked. Christopher Nolan can do no wrong.  #Interstellar  
zSWdZVtXT7E,NOLAN FTW
zSWdZVtXT7E,It looks like the ship in the movie uses a warp drive. Something both impossible and possible to manufacture. Someday right? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is sad! The music that starts at 1:00 is a shameless copy of the one in V for Vendetta when Evey comes out of V's fake capture and stands in rain and feels exhilarated! Tch tch. This is so wrong.
zSWdZVtXT7E,so Alfred is a space pioneer now ... lol great 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks epic McConaughey is awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
zSWdZVtXT7E,Engineers? Its more like the world doesn't need anymore lawyers.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"All Right, All Right..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie may be about time dilation.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this movie is my biggest nightmare...being sucked up in a black hole and being trapped having no where to get out...INTERSTELLER!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Getting some ""Contact"" flashbacks with McConaughey although looks like no aliens this time. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,just lost it
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks interesting but they do not know what Murphys law is, but his son does."
zSWdZVtXT7E,MICHAEL FLIPPING CAINE! :D I can't wait 'til November!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Am I the only one here weeping?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks like it will be at least as implausible as Gravity.

How many end of the world movies is it going to take before we actually start engaging with the real problems we face?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"There's far too many bloated, CGI, popcorn sci-fi's these days. I have a special place in my heart for the grounded but fantastical sci fi's of old. Inception really showed that Nolan can get the most out of his actors AND showcase spectacle without losing focus on either. I can't wait. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,So is this a continuation of Contact with Matthew Mcconaughey's character?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"im coming back, im just going to fly into a wormhole first "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"wipe your ass with another planet ,after this life after this world the judgment !
receive KING GOD JESUS now before it s too late !  IN LOVE AND WAR !
ALL HAIL KING JESUS !  ALL PRAISE EMMANUEL !"
zSWdZVtXT7E,'I'm coming back.' Not from a black hole you're not 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Isn't this music from ""V for Vendetta""?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,*Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio*
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks awesome 
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks amazing...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Am I going crazy, or did i see a batman symbol made out of stars behind the word interstellar? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"As with most sci-fi movies they're always science fact, not fiction.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Out of all the movies coming out this year, I'm looking forward to this one the most."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I would have strongly advised against putting Anne Hathaway as the thumbnail for this trailer. Made me almost not want to watch the film at all.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Prediction! The planet that they go to on the other side of wormhole will be very earth like. Why you ask? Because it would be extremely difficult to create a whole new type of exsistence
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""3005: a space/time odyssey"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"IN SUMMARY

ozone layer depletion makes global agriculture virtually impossible
farmer/engineer/pilot is tasked with leading first Interstellar mission using experimental prototype FTL warp bubble technology to find an inhabitable planet millions of light yrs away
Subplot explores ideas such as faith, the ultimate destiny of mankind in relation to our current home and the affects of time dilated space travel on the bonds of family and love itself"
zSWdZVtXT7E,why is the world ending in every movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murphy's brother is such a jerk to her. It's like the world's falling apart and teasing someone for their name is just cruel.
 It just seems completely contrary to the theme of the movie about people coming together for survival."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like the best contender for the first really decent sci-fi film since 2001 A Space Odyssey.

hopefully "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Will we ever... understand.. We are so much more... THERE is so much more... than this...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks amazing! I trust Christopher Nolan completely :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Boring!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Boring!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Meh, humanity should just stay here and destroy one planet instead of several"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that anne Hathaway? 1:52
zSWdZVtXT7E,Aliens? will they show the jedi 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Bring it on :))))))))))))
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It looks like it could be great, or be a flop. I saw Nolan when I extraed in TDKR, and he really puts a lot of effort in to his films. He is obsessive in how he shoots every scene. I believe there is more to the film than he is revealing in this trailer and us nolanites will love the final product. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks so bad
zSWdZVtXT7E,One of the best directors of today. Behind Darren Aronofsky of course;)
zSWdZVtXT7E,whats up with the v for vendetta music
zSWdZVtXT7E,is this reality?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This, is the science fiction movie we've all been waiting for..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Really? The world doesn't need anymore engineers? I would sure like to have some engineers around if we ran out of food.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What's fantastic about this trailer, is that it doesn't show a spec of footage of what happens after it goes interstellar. This allows you to enjoy the film on a whole new level."
zSWdZVtXT7E,After Inception with the spinning hallway it looks like he`s continuing quoting 2001: A Space Odysee - just look at the rotating spaceship above earth (only cockpit view here)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan i am sold period.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Alcubierrre drive theory 01:55 so pleased to see scientific research and theories in the trailer already!! Go Nolan!!
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks really good and Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is Nolan!! I Don't need more argument! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,WHERE IS THAT SONG FROM?? I swear I heard it in another trailer made recently.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wait...why don't they just move to mars?? They could teraform mars and live there as explained by scientists already...

I guess they wanna travel through space and time so that's cool

"
zSWdZVtXT7E,But....but November is too far away to see what happens after 2:08. I need to SEE IT NOW!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"John Freeman drove turck through cornfield with kids.

DAD, earth-mom is ded!

FOSSILE-FULES...YOU KILLED WIFE?!

enuf time 2 cry...gotta go space now to save humens again.

and john went into space to bring hopes and dreams to the hungries people of earth forrest of time."
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well NOT me!  I am NOT sold on this film because I don't think the trailer works nor does it excite me to see this film.  Glimpses of the World ending needs to seen through masters or wide shots - not in close ups and medium shots.  This still feels like an overrated extension of the teaser trailer.  There needs to be more of the crew of the ship - with out spoilers.  Check out GRAVITY, the trailers showed enough and didn't spoil anything.  If there was a grade scale I would give it an F."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow... they actually made a black hole look like it is supposed to scientifically
zSWdZVtXT7E,A M A Z I N G !  NOLAN NEVER FAILS TO IMPRESS!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"one funny thing, there is one thing in the solar system that without a doubt can help us.

Helium3, and it's on the Moon, enough to power the whole human population for at least a thousand years but most likely more, because once we break even on the fusion project, we'll be gaining more power than we spend to create it, we will thus be having our own solar power, pure energy, clean energy, no real side effects, other than the ingredients needed are on our moon, and planets/moons like it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,MY NAME IS MURPHIE! just had to say something.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks - and sounds - great to me.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Despite the fact that Nolan is directing this, I got sold when they decided to play V for Vendetta in the background of this trailer. That score piece is remarkable."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Staying utterly speechless by the beauty of this trailer, Godzilla freaked me out."
zSWdZVtXT7E,remember remember interstellar november.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone else notice there is so advertisement before this video? I love whoever arranged that. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yeah... The plot/story sound kind of generic, but I'm sure that what we're seeing here is just 1/3. Nolan was quoted saying that with this one he is honoring 2001, this one looks more conventional than that but it's the director of Inception we're talking about (ability to take generic plot and inject interesting concepts and ideas into it). I know it's early but cinematography looks gorgeous, i was kind of skeptical since he's working with new DP in this one but Hoytema is more then a fine replacement, angles, colors... everything looks beautiful but let's not get ahead of our selves. I would love it if this is pretty much all the information we would get about this movie, i get that it's impossible since everyone depends on this one to be a hit (WB gave up two of their major franchise's just so they could get a cut of the cake, two major studios WB and Paramout are together in this, Legendary pic. bowed out of Man of Steel just so they can finance this one, how much this one earns will in my opinion define Nolan's future career since TDK films and Inception had all batman hype around it, if this one is indeed what Nolan claims it to be and is really that popular it would mean that Nolan is to stay and that more 'not so dumb but kind of emotionless' movies are on the way). I can't wait but I'm kind of afraid since the last time i had huge hopes for a Nolan movie i was kind of disappointed (The Dark Knight Rises... you can't really say it's his fault but Man of Steel too, and big time...)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Jessica Chastain plays the adult version of Murphy (daughter of main character). 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Watching this made me feel like when I watched the Inception trailer for the first time. ""I do not know what this movie is REALLY about, but I'm in, and ready to watch another Nolan movie."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Our minds will be screwed again!!! (:V) F Yeaaa
zSWdZVtXT7E,We all know he's not coming back :(
zSWdZVtXT7E,I know this soundtrack but I can't name it and it's driving me crazy... Anyone recognise it?  
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks amazing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"pretty sure I just watched the whole movie, Problem, reaction, solution."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This SHOULD be called ""Interstellar SHOPPING TRIP."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,same music from V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,Time is a flat circle..
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:41 Older Murph maybe?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Based on the very first trailer I saw of this movie, I was expecting something completely different.  
This is even better than what I was expecting.
I hope it's one of those super epic movies that are becoming so rare nowadays.
Now I have two movies I'm looking forward to -- Earth to Echo and now this."
zSWdZVtXT7E,True Detective 2: Rust's Sacrifice 
zSWdZVtXT7E,MAKES NO SENSE THIS MOVIE! BORING
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks awesome. The trailer emits a nostalgic feeling of those old space exploration films and the song combined with the story really invokes emotion for those that love sci-fi and theoretical physics. I am looking forward to this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So excited for this movie!
zSWdZVtXT7E,SPACE BATMAN!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its looks Aaaalright Aaaright Aaright!!!lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,caine + nolan + zimmer = masterpiece
zSWdZVtXT7E,probably a three or at least 2 story movie unless its like 3 hours long.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Reasons to watch Interstellar:

1. Christopher Nolan
2. Hans Zimmer
3. Jonathan Nolan
4. Cast
5. Christopher Nolan"
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta song?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Gotta say, great choice in music for this trailer.  Dario Marianelli!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan does film making right. Period.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler: He doesn't come back because of Einsteins theory of relativity.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The new  ""Contact"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"slap nolans name on anything and people will go nuts, i need more than this to get me interested."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"nolan is the man
any one remembers the batman movies before him
does where some terribl shit
but he came and toke superheros movies to another level"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"chinese space ports on other planets.
just sayin."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is going to be awesome PERIOD.
zSWdZVtXT7E,thumbs up!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Remember in True Detective when Rust saw the wormhole! Theses two might has a connection. :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"watching the Interstaller trailer,  I now think Johnny Depp was miscast for Transendance, where was Keanu Reeves!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone else find it hard to see the movies as separate canons when the same director always hires the same cast? Now I'm just going to think that batman is running around somewhere while his butler builds space ships (Which actually doesn't sound too bad)
zSWdZVtXT7E,why don't we just fix the problems we have here now.  This movie looks like another Contact.  it gives the aura of a sci-fi movie but there is little sci-fi.  
zSWdZVtXT7E,I clicked on this trailer the moment I saw Anne Hathaway's face in the thumbnail. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm curious to what both Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck's roles in this movie are. I love how Nolan doesn't reveal everything about the movie in the trailer, unlike most movies these days. (Ahem, I'm looking at you Amazing Spider-Man 2). "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Who else is here because of Mackenzie? (:
This movie looks so amazing, can't wait to see it!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,you know its gonna be class when its christopher nolan!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I srsly hope this will be better than Transcendence. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,one can only imagine what lies beyond the wormhole
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love scifi movies! This loooks so amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Along with Jupiter ascending, edge of tomorrow, Godzilla, and much more. Why, why must i wait so long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,ಠ_ಠ
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I've been waiting so long for this kind of story for a sci-fi movie, finally Nolan you made it, I love it, believe me, but could you not possible chosen a different actor than Matthew McConaughey. I get it that it' a job and business and etc, I'm just annoyed of his whistling everytime he speaks an ""S"", especially for this kind of a major movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I will see this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Beautiful, beautiful. The last ""I'm coming back"" is chilling. The story with his daughter is evocative of the last episode of ""True Detective"" and Rust's despair at losing his daughter."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"V for Vendetta music!!! Sounds great, movie looks great. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The movie might be good but ""earth run out of food"" is BS.
The planet can support easily 150 billion people with cooperation and technology. Also If just half of the food that is thrown in trash would be instead distributed, could stop already world hunger now. 
The movie still can be very good just far from science. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's that song??????????
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan + Hans Zimmer = Unbeatable combo!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Good guy dad who lives near corn field and drives and old truck is sent on a mission to save the world.
The first part of the trailer felt really chliché, like an intro we've seen multiple times before. 
So I really hope the movie focuses on the space travel and doesn't spend 1 hour in the corn fields"
zSWdZVtXT7E,At last!!!! Can't wait for November to come! I wanna see what's after they warped (if they did)! #Nolan #Interstellar #HansZimmer 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like it could be cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,6 months!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"plot breakdown: father leaving his family to save mankind , The black hole can transport him into another dimention but this film will focus on the love aspect. I also think the the co stars which include Matt damon, Topher Grace and Casey Affleck all play different people of the same PERSON in different dimentions of space and time not like Inception, this is deeper then that.. The blackhole can change the fabric of the universe or  The Mutiverse. I also think this film will make space exploration a thing to talk about in 2015.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks really good! Will definitely go see this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,where we can have the soundtrack of this trailer please???
zSWdZVtXT7E,"gonna see it with 7-8 friends when it comes out, we're already planning major movie meet up on this one and hobbit. This film looks rally great, reminds me of contact a bit. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ain't nobody saw his ass again
zSWdZVtXT7E,"While time pass slowly through space, the time of the people who stay on earth, pass faster. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,838 Dislikes!!?? WHY??
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:33 are those cryogenic sleep chambers to be used for the long trip.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Guys don't expect Inception, Nolan can make any movie right now and you all would see it"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone else notice that this music is the exact same as V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks good, when does it come out?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not what i was expecting but looks good
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not what i was expecting but looks good
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've been waiting for an official trailer only for this to leave me hanging with more questions. And I love it....can't wait to see this movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,So the planet is dying and people are starving when throughout the whole scene on earth it is basically covered in corn fields. Then they travel in a weird ball thing that doeskin look like a warp drive type of idea or wormhole.  Yeah this trailer made no sense at all.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was that Jessica Chastain as the daughter as an adult? Sick! Will definitely watch now.
zSWdZVtXT7E,LOOKS VERY GOOD. I'LL BE WAITING FOR THIS
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christian Bale should've played matthew's role..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I will come back, but I gave the Aliens my T-shirt."
zSWdZVtXT7E,november ?? be quick.. !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another Epic movie that couldn't come soon enough! Can't wait! Great cast. I like McConaghue after watching True Detective.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri: The Movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,another Nolan film eh? time to expect another film that will be great to watch but have your brain hurting like hell from thinking about what happened in it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Warner Bros moives are awesome if you agree thumbs up!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan, do me a child <3"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Didn't like it
zSWdZVtXT7E,"She is going to be an old grandma when he returns, if he is lucky. And he will barely have aged. It will be such a mind trip."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What? your GMO crops not working anymore silly earthlings!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm seeing Academy Award for Best Cinematography. 
The Visuals look stunning, and one of the most promising films in a long while. Nolan won't disappoint. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie sounds like it's meant to subliminally convince us that we are not meant to be on planet earth. Like we are not a natural part of the earth. The truth is that the earth itself did create us and all organisms here. We are supposed to live on earth. Biologically we are designed precisely FOR earth life. I think we should focus on sustaining the earth, not preparing to rape and leave it!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,You know this movie is going to be fantastic just because it's the first film to depict a black hole as it's supposed to look and not just a big cosmic vortex.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is bound to happen though
zSWdZVtXT7E,"one word: woooooow!!!

cant wait to see it on november!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks Amazing ! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the idea of this movie is pretty good, though many countries are too involved with stupid idle things to explore"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have to see this!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"More like ""The Dark Interstellar"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"All right, this looks amazing."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks mehy, no to interesting or uninteresting. Definitely not exited to go see it"
zSWdZVtXT7E,like it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why did they use music from V for Vendetta in this trailer?????
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This soundtrack belongs to V for Vendetta !
The scene where Natalie Portman cries under the rain !"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hell he's not coming back is he?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Um, sooo why do the TV's and cars and stuff look old even for now? yet they build a spaceship that goes through a wormhole? mmk"
zSWdZVtXT7E,so they use an alcubierre drive to leave the solar system
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I honestly think that he should have co-directed Prometheus with Ridley Scott, now that would have been another epic movie. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,is it me or does remind me of 2001: A Space Odyssey? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Say aren't they trying to match Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey? Just a thought...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have been hearing a lot about this movie, but I had intentionally avoided the trailers. I just didn't really want to know about it just yet, but I'm very glad that I watched this. This movie looks really good, I can't wait for it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This. Is. Epic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,v for vendetta soundtrack!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i cant help but here him say ""mastah wayne"" after everything he says i think its a problem."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"All I can say is....GOD IS IN THE RAIN

haha but this movie does look pretty good"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Interesting. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Exquisite. Anne Hathaway looks so cute in a spacesuit. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We must think not as individuals, but as a species"" Meanwhile Russia is withdrawing out of the ISS-the end pretty much, because of US sanctions..everything goes against the interests of Humanity. They can have their petty disputes but they better leave science out of it. They should be a geneva like agreement with a basis that excludes science from these types pathetic disputes. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I really enjoyed the first trailer,  it gave you just enough. The second trailer went from a tease to showing just a little too much & a bit of an let down 

The first trailer reminded me a lot of Carl Sagan's contact

I Hope this  movie turns out to be a blockbuster

"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The space stuff looks cool but as always with Nolan most of the character scenes already look too heavy and cold, which makes it boring. I guess we'll see..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""God is in the rain"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Michael Caine? Hell yeah!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Guys, a space movie that isn't riding on thrills/ horor?! And it is being made/ acted by amazing people?! Calling it right now best movie of the year."
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks gay as hell.  warner brothers for one.. over sentimental for 2.  generic happy predictable ending for 3.  cute kid side kick- 4.  heavy CGI- 5.  looks like it has all the elements for a summer blockbuster.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Will finally get to find out what happened to the brave men, women, and robot, that went through ""The Black Hole""?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,hey
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope it has some Daft Punk in it.
It was the fist thing that cross my mind when i read the title"
zSWdZVtXT7E,im in tears :')
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks better than expected. I might actually go see it.
The little girl seems like a terrible actress though, but I can't be sure."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why is a farmer flying a spaceship? It seems they ran out of astronauts as well as food.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A Christopher Nolan film, what can go wrong? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,November????? I can't wait til freakin' November dammit!!!! lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So the only changes this far if compared to early script that leaked are that Murph is now a girl and it's not Russian surveillance drone but instead Indian (probably because Russia's a bigger movie market than India and to lower political implications we now have)...

And, of course, McConaughey will be a fantastic Cooper."
zSWdZVtXT7E,0:18 and a detective.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Good thing global warming is fake.
zSWdZVtXT7E,NOLAN. ZIMMER. SPACE. OH. SNAP. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Chris Noaln makes Michael Bay movies look like a first grader wrote and directed them
zSWdZVtXT7E,awesome use of v for vendetta soundtrack
zSWdZVtXT7E,I dont get it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yes, let's plant the seeds that we don't NEED to worry about saving this planet or changing our ways so that we seal our fate. Everyone ignores that fact that humans can't survive the waves of known radiation in out solar system yet alone the unknown. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was that a black hole they just went into?  Because don't do that.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Obviously, most directors have a certain tone with their craft. Spielberg is ""awe-inspiring""...Tarantino is ""direct""...Selick is ""curiosity""...when I think Nolan, I think ""logic"". Should I give up my family for the sake of mankind? Once we know the answer, the question becomes ""can I?"", which is where the heart of this movie will be. This man loves hypotheticals..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Reminds me of the movie Contact I just seen.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan doesn't have a knack for anything other than small-scale thrillers. His Batman movies are unfocused and completely insipid and he managed to turn Inception's premise into one of the dullest sci-fi movies I've ever seen. This will probably be no different. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,ill watch it...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks soooo boring!!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Camera work, CGI and other effects look very good as always in Nolan movies. Hope the story will also be with some mystery at the end like in ""Inception"". I bet Hans Zimmer will make good soundtracks also."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Take note other directors. This looks AMAZING
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did they just fly into a blackhole?  
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Just a hunch, but I don't think he's coming back. :("
zSWdZVtXT7E,I agree with the whole premise of this film. The future of the human race is not on this planet. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,It looks good but to much talking puts me off. I like a mixture of horror & scares with a little talking and fair amount of action.
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan We Trust
zSWdZVtXT7E,I like your show
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is what happened to Mud.
zSWdZVtXT7E,the fires look like yesterday in my neighborhood...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"McConaughey and Nolan, show me the beauty of the universe."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Everyone gushing over Chris Nolan, don't forget that Dark Knight Rises was far below expectations. In Nolan I no longer trust, but I do have faith, though."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I must buy my tickets in advance before all the seats are taken to watch this movie at the movie theater!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What really blows me away is how right Nolan was about McConaughey. It was seen as a mystifying casting choice (at best) at the time, and now he looks like a genius following the Oscar win."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think I'm destined to see this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"this song was used in V for vendetta
is it a famous song?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks great.

There are many sci-fi movies about space ships and alien, but less about mankind exploring space."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Just talked to Christopher or Chris as I call him. He said the kids gave it a Spielberg feel , space stuff gave a Lucas flavor and now he's thinking of putting in digital images of Michael Madsen asking everyone to bite him. He's a genius."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm perhaps going to watch this for Nolan only, the casts are terrible.  Don't like any of them."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V For Vendetta Soundtrack  - Evey Reborn 
zSWdZVtXT7E,why everybody has so many likes???
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This music sounds familiar, i cant seem to figure out where i heard it before."
zSWdZVtXT7E,so he comes back w/ the aesthetics of Nolan...excellent!
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow!!!!!!! NOLAN+ZIMMER=EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cannot wait
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's Matt MacdonaldHey doing with a demon child?? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan next big masterpiece
zSWdZVtXT7E,
zSWdZVtXT7E,The part where they're being submerged in the hibernation tanks (I'm assuming that's what those are) gave me chills.
zSWdZVtXT7E,of course no chris nolan movie would be complete without michael cain. haha :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Although I didn't get all of the goosebumps, I did get some of them.  Also some feels.  I"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks good! So glad Matthew isn't doing rom-coms anymore. Dude's too serious an actor for that ish.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hopefully, it's not gonna be like Gravity where it relies too much on visuals."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can just tell there is going to be a huge twist in the end. Like for example they go into the wormhole, land on a new planet and find out in the end it's Earth in the future. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Finally the official trailer!
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan we trust 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"U get goosebumps, bro?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan Fans!!! Instagram :@Supersport5th Follow for a Follow!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Dario Marianelli - ""Evey Reborn"" makes the trailer much more powerful"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wait Cole? This is a big twist in the True Detective series! Did not see this coming.
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""YES!!"" Finally sumewat of disclosure...cnt wait to c this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""the world doesn't need any more engineer...""
So who build the ship? actors?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For anyone having trouble placing the song, it's God is in the Rain from V for Vendetta. Took me forever to figure it out, lol: /watch?v=lXf6wxeMFHc "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew's whistling ass annoying voice. Naw thanks.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Here just to see the conments
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks good!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Let me guess.
He doesn't come back."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it just me or is Jessica Chastain clearly going to play an older version of his daughter?
zSWdZVtXT7E,People.. i've got gosebumbs! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,GRAVITY?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is gonna be good
zSWdZVtXT7E,i was sent here by a person...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm not surprised that any comment here has so many likes, it's Nolan after all :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I never really enjoyed a Chris Nolan film, that's the honest truth."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The procrastinators are approaching...TAKE COVER 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This better not end like Armageddon.
zSWdZVtXT7E,In the name of science! This is the future! BREATHTAKING! The wormhole in this trailer follows the law of physics to the word.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"to me, the hurdle for space travel is those nickel and quarter sized pieces of iron that are traveling at 40k+ mph, once you learn how to ""deflect"" those little pieces of iron/metal, then we can concentrate on trying to find how to even obtain a small % of light speed "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I guess you could say that this film looks.. out of this world...

God I hate myself."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anybody else getting a semi-2001 vibe from this movie so far? Especially when they finally get into space. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"@2:04""Alright, alright, alright."" "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where is batman when you need him Nolan?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Murphy's Law is apparently that if anything can be twisted into Global Warming Propaganda it will be twisted into Global Warming Propaganda.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Michael Caine is soo sweet!!!
He always takes care of the children!! :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love how this Trailer doesn't reveal the whole plot, we are questioning what will happen and in doing so it is encouraging us to see it more. Hopefully all the trailers stay as ambiguous as this one does and brings back the days where you have to see the movie to know the plot, and not go in knowing what will happen. Ever since the first teaser i called this as my film of the year; fingers are still crossed..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Isn't that the kid from the couch?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"lemme guess, he doesn't come back."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I CANT WAIT!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is the best! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have been looking forward to this movie for about a year now, and this trailer makes me even more excited. Mathew might win best actor two years in a row at the Oscars."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Lol, this might just save kids' dreams to be astronauts after they were ruined in Gravity "
zSWdZVtXT7E,The new Civilization Beyond Earth trailer looks amazing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,as always americans save the world
zSWdZVtXT7E,About what is the movie  ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I got sent here by a guy who was blown up by a turquoise bastard who told him to wait, and then blew his head up."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love that even though this movie has CGI, it showed people from a family being sad instead of of rockets and space. You can tell the script of the movie contains  much more than a bunch of explosions and destruction."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"On the other side of the black hole, Carl Sagen was waiting for them."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"hello. 
hello.
follow me.
okay. 
wait.
okay."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mankind is dying a group of astraunts go outer space to circle around a star this makes time go faster while all menkind die and earth becomes stable again the astraunts return because 100 years are like days in outer space round that star
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mankind is dying a group of astraunts go outer space to circle around a star this makes time go faster while all menkind die and earth becomes stable again the astraunts return because 100 years are like days in outer space round that star
zSWdZVtXT7E,is this a Wall-e prequel?
zSWdZVtXT7E,everybody knows that time is flat circle right  ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I was like being involved in it.Nolan evinced the proud species
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It was spectacular especially with zimmer's score in it. Nolan really wants us to speculate about it and scratch our heads until the release. He is a smart ass but yeah surely, this will be going to be a mind boggling flick of the year."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Am I the only one with David Bowie in my head now?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm curious to see how this one turns out.  I really hope that most of that footage came from the first 1/2 hour; I wouldn't be thrilled to sit for over an hour while McConaughey says goodbye to his family.  But Nolan's only directorial stumble so far has been The Dark Knight Rises, so I'll certainly see it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,HYPED!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hi procrastinators :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So they went to bring corn. Gotta be a good one! Matthew, ya ya ya!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,When does this come out?
zSWdZVtXT7E,kids are always annoying....
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Another poor Nolan's movie that will be hugely overrated and fanatically praised by his fanboys...
Meh, nothing new. I'm disappointed that Matthew wants to ruin his career so soon after obtaining the Oscar award"
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's gonna be epic
zSWdZVtXT7E,Guys! Keep in mind that this trailer only shows the first 30 minutes of the movie! Nolan is trying to keep all the good stuff a secret by not spoiling anything in the trailers. Just you wait! This will be his best movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,like if u r a procrastonator
zSWdZVtXT7E,Finally a high budget sci fi movie 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Just a thought, I think one of the main characters will die, but he will really be the only one alive at the end, crazy and complex, but it is Nolan."
zSWdZVtXT7E,hi
zSWdZVtXT7E,"um, I already saw this as an ad."
zSWdZVtXT7E,i don't get it. something's happening on earth so they're sending people into space to...what? repopulate another planet? see if there's any other life or a cure for the food crisis somewhere else? just see how far they can go? it also doesn't seem like the dad's coming back so why did he tell his daughter he would? Am I just dumb?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow. I have no words for this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alcubierre drive  1:54 :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mackenzie Foy plays his daughter in this movie. She was Bella's daughter in Breaking Dawn  part 2.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sadly to say, this is highly unlikely to be happening anytime soon. The farthest thing humans have sent into space hasn't even left our own solar system. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,2014: A Space Odyssey 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Now there is a single father with two kids, forced to leave them with Michael Caine to do some ""impossible job"".

Where did I watch that kind of movie? :-/"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"ah it's killing me, i can't figure out where i've heard this song from!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,im so glad I waited to see this trailer in front of Godzilla in IMAX. it truly looks incredible and watching it on the IMAX screen made me even more hyped!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"anybody recognize the song at 1:25?
IF YOUR THINKING V FOR VENDETTA, your a friend."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For the meek shall inherit the Earth, the rest of us will go to the Stars!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"First thing that came to mind was Muse- Exogenesis Symphony pt. 2 Cross Pollination. It would be awesome if it made it to the movies soundtrack, it fits well."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Welcome back Mr. 
Nolan!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Thank God it's not in 3D 
zSWdZVtXT7E,One word sums up how I feel about this: Fantastic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here - WOW"
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's the sound track 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Chris Nolan is the only movie director that still used film cameras for his movies and that is the reason why his movies always look different than the others. Great trailer by the way.!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Whoa. Yes.  Must watch now.
zSWdZVtXT7E,A Trailer finally ... 1) Looks Awesome 2) Can't wait 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well this looks cheerful.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Offt - this looks guid. Mcconaughey is on a roll!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This look to be one of those movies where humanity is doomed and their is no hope. Why would I want to see a movie where just a few people survive when Billions die. Total buzz kill.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I know it's cliche to be worried about acting choices; but Hathaway usually gives pretty sub-par performances...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Depressing and foreboding.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it just me or does that baseball scene give away more about the plot than people notice. Namely what decade is it when Cooper was still on Earth? Doesn't that look like a 70s era? Or is it just me? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool
zSWdZVtXT7E,Already addicted to the trailer.. Goose skin and all that feelings! No doubt its gonna be epic and movie of 2014!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I bet in the movie they end up finding a planet but then after that return it's been so long becuase they used a wormhole the space bubble looks like . And maybe finds out they are the last of humanity and then it ends
zSWdZVtXT7E,test
zSWdZVtXT7E,That looks interesting 
zSWdZVtXT7E,is this is what I think it is ?.Space with in the space with in another space to meet outer space !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Damn novembers a while from now...
zSWdZVtXT7E,OMG looks brillant! can't wait november to see it
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Everybody saying that they entered some sort of black hole or wormhole, how about this:  all of that machinery surrounding the spacecraft and that spectacular cgi bubble suggest to me that, in the movie, they have developed some kind of warp drive.  Looks like they're going with the theory of bending space around the ship as opposed to propelling the ship itself.  Just look up warp drive on google.  It's theoretically possible, and I'm guessing it would look a lot like what they did in this trailer.
Or, you know.  It could just be a wormhole, i guess..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where could I have listen to this song previously? Do you know it?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I dont know whether this movie going to be good or bad, as long as its produced from Nolan, I would definitely watch it"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Song?
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks AMAZING!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love Nolan, but come on people. This is like every sci fi film and grapes of wrath combined, but rehashed as interstellar. He's blatantly taking elements from Contact and Star gate. I feel like I've already seen the movie and it's not even out yet."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't like the movie's idea of leaving our planet to die :/
zSWdZVtXT7E,god..do anything.. but don't kill me before November!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Epic trailer. Has a  2001:A Space Odyssey feel. I don't know how coherent the final plot will be, but I'm sure the experience will be awesome."
zSWdZVtXT7E,If Christopher Nolan makes a James Bond movie I want the title to be INTELLIGENCE!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Too bad interstellar travel isn't exactly possible. Only way it'd work is if you are going fast enough to feel effects of time dilation. But I doubt they are using an anti-matter engine to achieve that. Since the ship blasted off of earth with more conventional fuel. Even if you can get up close to light speed to feel the effects of time dilation, at that speed, dust would hit the hull of your ship and explode like an artillery shell. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Preferred the score from the first trailer. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's the name of the song?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awesome!! Can't wait for this movie!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks really good..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Amazing trailer! It leaves so many questions, this is how all trailers should be like."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I dunno. I'm kind of dissappointed. The cast is terrible outside of Michael Cain and Anne hatheway. And I was hoping for a star trek/mass effect style open space epic. Not grapes of wrath meets star gate.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I know little of this movie. Damnit, Nolan."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is a prequel to true detective
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Song is ""Evey Reborn"" from V for Vendetta"
zSWdZVtXT7E,No one knows what's beyond the heliopause
zSWdZVtXT7E,No one knows what's beyond the heliopause
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone know the name of the  song that was playing in this trailer?? :O
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan's movie going to watch it + space sci fi = awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie looks stunning, it's about time that a new space movie was made, and I'm glad that Nolan is the one to be directing it. This is going to be amazing!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"HAHAHAHAHAHA, "" the world doesn't need anymore engineers, we ran out of food""  thank the engineer when you sit down and eat something because of irrigation...and pesticides... and tools...tractors...maybe soon some farms that can harvest their own crops...not watching a movie based on that premise, sorry WB's. Oh and the world does need more engineers, get that education everyone..get that education"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Good trailer I'm pretty hyped for it so far but I don't understand most of the dialogue seen from the first 15 seconds. And the kids are acting so awkward toward one another.
zSWdZVtXT7E,respect to nolan  for not giving much plot in the trailer.... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like some serious food for your brain and your eyes. can't wait to see it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,lk
zSWdZVtXT7E,a lot of people consider this scifi. I look at this as very possible near future reality. this is what were heading towards. most people will think im stupid for saying this. but its happening right now. in our lifetime.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope Nolan doesn't make the story non-linear like he does with everything else. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Pretty sure I saw Anne Hathaway's face so I just had to click
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's the guy from Dallas Buyers Club that got aids.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Great Video
zSWdZVtXT7E,I came more times with Christopher Nolan trailers than I did with xvideos. And I really hope this music is in the soundtrack. IT IS EPIC!!!! Another masterpiece is on it's way to IMAX. I will be there!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow.
zSWdZVtXT7E,YES!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Leaving the planet is the only way to escape Libtardism and preachy films.
We would have to (realistically) populate and exploit the resources of the solar system before we could move beyond it. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,November?!? Go fuck yourself November. Oh and it seems like we know what Alfred went to do after being Batmans butler :p
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hmmm. interesting
got to find for more to understand
and to watch hope there'll relese a nre trailer"
zSWdZVtXT7E,You had me at Christopher Nolan.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Lol, trying to win awards since Gravity did so well."
zSWdZVtXT7E,At least its better then some girl choking in space for 2 hours. (gravity)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Kind of rushed. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Definitely very Spielberg-influenced (not that there's anything wrong with that) but I'm not yet sold. Plus I can't stand Matthew McConaughey.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like a a movie confronting issues of science and economics. The issues I can see on the trailer is earth is running out of food due to some natural or man made disaster involving massive dust storms similar to those of the Great Depression.

The line "" the world doesn't need anymore engineers...... we ran out of food"" is small reference to the fact that IRL the world is running out of farmers.

The government is sending people to other star systems to look for habitable worlds. I can see the use of hypersleep, some kind of space traveling device that bends space-time most likely an Alcubierre warp drive.

I'm excited to finally see a movie about the potential, adventure, and discoveries of the first interstellar travel by mankind. Something I feel is the most important issue for the future and survival of humanity."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So, let me get this straight. We screw up the world and leave?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,what is it with movie trailers stealing music from movies that have already been made. this song is from v for vendetta... man of steel did it too with the song from lord of the rings.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want to watch this badly!!! :D and why are there thumbs up on every comments? lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow. ""We must not think of mankind as individuals but as a species."" If that's what it takes to save man kind we are doomed."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"One day we will need to make that choice.
Live in space or be extinguished in Earth."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer gave me chills... Looking forward to this. A lot.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Seems like there maybe some time laps in the travel, his daughter grows up, can't wait "
zSWdZVtXT7E,is he jebus??
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I wish it wasn't about our food source but still I love it, Been waiting for this movie for about 10 months even before 1st trailer "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why is Alfred Pennyworth in every Christopher Nolan movie?
zSWdZVtXT7E,These types of sci-fi movies are the best sci-fi movies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks interesting. I just hope the trailer only covers the first 45 minutes or so. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks boring. Just like all of Nolans movies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"somehow, i wanna watch this one."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music? I'm sold already.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Amazing trailer. The ship uses the technology to trip through the wormhole. Very real to our physics-based acknowledge today. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,doesn seem like a typical nolan movie:((.really lacks the nolan zimmer effect!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hey why do people think that a black hole is a portal/ worm-hole instead of thinking that it is just an extremely dense object... just sayin  
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music: ""Evey Reborn"" from Dario Marianelli's V For Vendetta score (the rain scene)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,If you like twisted animations view my video's at evilmike2nd
zSWdZVtXT7E,"michael caines voice plus that music, leik if you cant help but crie everyteim"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Holly shit! WTF? There is a plenty of great classical sci-fi books but these motherfuckers make films with the plots whom authors don't even know what gravity is!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks interesting as heck. I can't wait to see it :D 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hate to say it but this looks incredibly CORNY. Hopefully the sentimental crap on earth is only the first twenty minutes of the film. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,He's going to enter a time warp and himself in ten years is going to save the world.
zSWdZVtXT7E,hell yeah!
zSWdZVtXT7E,We don't need engineers any more . . . We ran out of food. Sounds to me like you need engineers more than ever.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well, doesn't look to bad, does it?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,AWESOMENESS!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We ran out of food.""  Then stop burning crops to keep prices up, geniuses.

I'm a fan of Sci-fi & space/time/dimensional travel...but I'm sorry, but the circumstances in the movie are all juvenile.  Everything we ever need is already here on earth, and more importantly within ourselves."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Don't forget that Nolan still has to make a crapy movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,MUST SEE NOW
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Now if the characters in the movie make rational decisions and all the actions done by the characters are realistic, and there are no plot holes, this can turn out to be  pretty good movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,At last!  A wormhole done properly!
zSWdZVtXT7E,where can I find this song?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Look at all these dicksucking nolanfaggots hype this shitty trailer rofl
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What is it Nolan and corn fields? Is that supposed to be his lame representation of what ""good-old-fashioned-middle-Americans"" hang out in all day? The more films this guy does, continues to expose him as not a visual mastermind, but just a guy who loves corn."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"To that I say alright, alright, alright..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,How come every movie that comes out now is sci-fi 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was that a black hole they went into?
zSWdZVtXT7E,trailer music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Αεκ
zSWdZVtXT7E,"thats the soundtrack from V for Vendetta...cant they find a new one?
movie looks amazing though"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"JESUS – “I GOT THIS”
Worry, - it’s almost a basic need isn’t it? Some people need something to worry about to feel alive. Worry – that activity that’s like a rocking chair – gives us something to do but gets us nowhere. Worry, the fear of the possible, the unknown, the future: it may even be justifiable and a clear and present danger. But shift into faith gear, close your eyes and hear/see/feel JESUS … “I got this”. Smile it’s a done deal."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The craziest thing about the trailer is that most of the footage shown is only within the first 25 minutes of the movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i'm sure this will have all the standard visual and directing stylings that nolan fans love. that being said, i wonder if they actually will find anything out in space (and show it as part of the story) or just be ambiguous about it and make 80% of the movie just getting ready for the mission. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,dang this looks really interesting!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't say this movie looks bad, Iam digging it"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"While I don't fully know the context of the movie, we can feed the world 7 times or more over right now... we are not going to run out of food as we can use vertical farming.  And engineers could make it so running out of food would never even happen if we were a rogue planet with no sun..  But I do like the positive message in the trailer that we are meant to go to space and should think of ourselves as a species :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,A Must-See Movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is great
zSWdZVtXT7E,Judging by this trailed he actually go into space and beyond in last 5-th of the film and all the rest will be on earth?
zSWdZVtXT7E,That music though! WOW!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm really tired of these movie trailers that ruin 90% of the movie. All i have to do now is google the end on November and I can save money on a movie ticket.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Unofficial space odyssey remake?
zSWdZVtXT7E,why the bgm so familiar? which moive did i hear it from? many THANKS
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie is again going to play with our minds, just like how inception did..I just hope this one has a definitive ending to it "
zSWdZVtXT7E,The score for this commercial is almost exactly like the music in Meet Joe Black... Awesome trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Modern Space Odyssey !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone know if this movie is loosely based on Apollo 13 or Apollo 18?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"well, sign me up for interracial travel"
zSWdZVtXT7E,nolan is an alien from kpax
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just watch the movie end when he goes into the black hole because he dies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well this looks like a life changer...
zSWdZVtXT7E,oh nice he gets sucked in to a black hole they are fucked !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,τροοοομεερηηη!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,hopefully this will make up for how god awful Gravity was. in terms of big budget space films. seriously Gravity had its great visuals but you could tell the story was an afterthought. And my god the acting. So horrible. McConaughey & Hathaway > Sandra Bullock & George Clooney
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait ! A science fic movie by Christopher ! Wow ! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"INTERSTELLAR IS THE NAME OF THE VIDEO CLIP MADE BY LEIJI MATSUMOTO WITH THE BAND DAFT PUNK, WHO DEMAND SECURE"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Most trailers give away too much of the plot, this one was just short of enough.
Though I'll give them points for not giving it all away like every other movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks like a 3 hour snore fest the critics will love and most fans will call boring.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope that we will see spaceship flying in the middle of the movie or sooner, it would be bad to waste the whole movie on scenes with corn, burning corn and farewell talk."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Surely only 13-year-olds can hold the view that Nolan has ever made a masterpiece. If you want a masterpiece, watch the films of Kubrick, Bergman or Lynch. Hell, even more recently, Michael Haneke has made quite a few in his career. With The Dark Knight Rises, however, he did make a flat-out bad film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Murphy is older at 1:40 ...has anybody else noticed this?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Im coming back. Yeah, ok."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did Monsanto write this movie?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"can't get over how beautiful that soundtrack is
very impressed"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Would love to know the name of the song
zSWdZVtXT7E,Shut up and take my money...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yeah, this won't happen, Nolan. We WILL have to save our planet to survive, and we must start now."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks great! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Love the use of the music from V for Vendetta... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome .
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cannot. Wait. 2014 is gonna be a good year. Christopher Nolan in November than PTA in December??? Couldn't ask for more. Except maybe an Inherent Vice trailer now that Interstellar has released one.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"that shit looks awesome, i want it now."
zSWdZVtXT7E,这是什么电影
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music from V for Vendetta was awesome, too."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Murphy's Law is going to go wrong with this movie. Interstellar will be a definite blockbuster!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anne Hathaway is so cute
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love the way the trailer ends right when they descend into the unkown..Leaves mystery to the plot.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What I want to know is if they find another habitable planet ;). Yeah, it does look good. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,test
zSWdZVtXT7E,My most anticipated film of the year!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The orb in space is suppose to be a black hole. And with that-there is a theory to travel time you would have to get close to one, like they do in the movie, and your life span is pro longed in that orbit. Theory that you would out live the normal human life. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For anyone wanting to know what the beautiful music for this trailer is, its part of the V for Vendetta soundtrack, composed by Dario Marianelli."
zSWdZVtXT7E,He looks like that taken guy
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When I saw the thumbail of this trailer, I got an orgasm"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Still a better parent than Edward Cullen xD
zSWdZVtXT7E,Meh
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I will be first in line to see this. Looks amazing! Mix a story of an engineer with the freedom of possibility within SciFi, add realistic problems that the world faces - food shortages, global warming, declining space exploration program, add Christopher Nolan's writing AND Hans Zimmer's music AND Matthew Mcconaughey's career prime and you seriously may get a masterpiece on your hands here."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm surprised they didn't spoil where he was going and was he was doing there, and the ending, just in the trailer, it's how all the trailers have been this year so far."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Not only is Alfred Pennyworth Bruce Wayne's trusty British mentor, he is humanity's!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"they put that time warp idea in here, awesome"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"And just like that, this is now my most anticipated film for the rest of 2014."
zSWdZVtXT7E,One of Life's greatest mysteries told in a story by a marvelous storyteller... This is gonna be one heck of an awesome movie..
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm going to guess most of us here are going to go and watch this?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Aw ye that music is from v for vendetta! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is going to be absolutely amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nope Kevin Costner nope not seeing it
zSWdZVtXT7E,Amazing trailer. Challenges and breaks all barriers of the sci-fi genre. Can't wait!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The first one was a way batter 
more touching "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm looking forward to everything except Hans Zimmer's score, that guy's music is so samey."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Departure from Nolans usual work, can't wait to see this film"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"2:05 ""Oh my God... it's full of stars!"" Please, tell me that you recognize this"
zSWdZVtXT7E,He ain't coming back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan doesn't disappoint when it comes to picking music for the trailer and having a Michael Caine dialogue 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It's supposed to be a wormhole at the end, not a blackhole, otherwise they'd be stuck forever, either that or its aliens, but most likely a wormhole."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I feel like the story to this will not fit into one movie xD.
zSWdZVtXT7E,TITS!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli. From the V for Vendetta soundtrack.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow wow wow.. Breathtaking. & I thought Gravity was the movie I was waiting my life for, but this oh man... #hype"
zSWdZVtXT7E,it's good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,It should be Oscars' choice.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Who is setting all their fields on fire?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Earth is dying...and a wormhole is discovered in space...end of story
zSWdZVtXT7E,Similar movie to Zemeckis' movie Contact?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hi
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer is going to have one tough job following Dario Marianelli's Evey Reborn 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"wow, so many sci fi movies. about time. ive been waiting for Hollywood to wake up :) these next two years are full of them."
zSWdZVtXT7E,If that's a black hole then it's not right.
zSWdZVtXT7E,mankind was born on earth it was never meant to die here....awesome..
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan? You had me at plot hole
zSWdZVtXT7E,Epic Movie of the year !!!  (2014)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i just cant stop checking this trailer , makes me wanna go Interstellar  !!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,woah...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm excited for this movie because it looks like Nolan did a lot of research. When I saw the warp bubble, I almost squealed. Can't wait."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm excited for this movie because it looks like Nolan did a lot of research. When I saw the warp bubble, I almost squealed. Can't wait."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just the fact that Christopher Nolan directs this is enough to make me go see it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Damn, the music in this trailer is fantastic. Anyone know what the title and artist of the track is, or where I could download it?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks pretty beast.
zSWdZVtXT7E,James cllevend
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Its going to be a great movie. Guarantee. Just the fact that Nolan is directing it and Matthew with Michael are staring in it, make it worth watching."
zSWdZVtXT7E,For those of you wondering... It's Evey Reborn by Dario Marianelli.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow, It's scary, O.O, Sci Fi and Drama, maybe it could win the oscar bets special effects."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"oh, yes...."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone see Godzilla? How was it?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is going to be so cool!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wish Botox had never been invented. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Most of this trailer was amazing, but the ""save the world"" thing is a little bit trite. I'm not sure how good this movie's going to be from the trailer, but it's Christopher Nolan. I remember seeing the trailer for Inception and not being impressed and that movie blew me away. If I can't trust him, I don't think I could be able to bring myself to the movies at all. In Nolan we trust."
zSWdZVtXT7E,ITS DYSTOPIAN GUYS
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I feel like this is the post The 100 series, 100 years ago before they settled above the earth."
zSWdZVtXT7E,@Mandlize you have to account for time spent traveling plus time spent at the destination plus time traveling back to earth. I don't think they're using light speed (not fast enough). Looks like they're using a black hole(I hope not LOL unless we've discovered it really doesn't spaghettify us while passing through it) or some way to bend the fabric of space to make the journey really plausible. I'm excited about this movie. #dayone
zSWdZVtXT7E,freakin awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope it's just as good as Inception
zSWdZVtXT7E,It seems that Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck are playing grown up kids of Cooper. So i guess Cooper will travel to the future or may be another reality.
zSWdZVtXT7E,ZZZzzzzzzzz ZZZZzzzzzzzz ZZZZZZZzzzzzzz
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hey guys you should check out contact, it came out in 1997 and I reckon Nolan had some inspiration in this. Matthew McConaughey was also the cast in this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What was the song playing in the background it was awesome.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sean Carroll, Lawrence Krauss, and Michio Kako all got a call to be scientific technical advisers for this film. I wonder who got the gig? Either way, it's a great premise for a film!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another Nolan masterpiece coming out next year.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why are so many random comments here got so many thumbs up??
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Jesus Mary and Joseph, did you hear that soundtrack? Holy hell, this movie will be stunning..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So far this looks like an all-star cast wrapped around a weak story.
zSWdZVtXT7E,is the earth interstellar between  the sun and that other thing that serves us no purpose at all?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Soooo religious people.     God tries to end the world but    science and technology.   Beats his ass. 


Spoiler.    Humans meet aliens at the end"
zSWdZVtXT7E, Chris Nolan + Jonathan Nolan + Hans Zimmer= Masterpiece. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,love it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait not to see this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"what i see is, maybe  this trailer has made from just 30 minutes from the film.. and still all people like it... thats cristopher nolan for you.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,yipeee....... another of Nolan's movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,Obnoxiously fambly oriented for the low wage and baseball.  HuGS Mr. Cookie!
zSWdZVtXT7E,this movie is GONNA BLOW MY MIND!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,When Worlds collide!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,warn a brother
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Absolutely beautiful. Christopher Nolan has done it again!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oscartonium will save us Matthew.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have a feeling that this is either going to be lackluster or really really good
zSWdZVtXT7E,well they sure as hell have got my money
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yankees save the world again?...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Fantastic picture
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is Michael Caine in all Christopher Nolan movies???
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack!!!! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was expecting batman to appear all throughout the trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Epic....
zSWdZVtXT7E,I would've watched this movie anyways but it has a similar soundtrack to V?!  How am I supposed to resist that?  I'd watch anything to that soundtrack.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks so good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"sooo... at 2:08, is that the ship warping or disintegrating?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack....beautiful as always :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Am I the only one who hears the V for Vendetta music? When she walks into the rain bit?
zSWdZVtXT7E,One of the reasons that I like Nolan’s movies is that he is still shooting his movies on FILM. Digitally captured movies and TV programming almost always lack the same visual impact.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I was already going to see this film regardless of the trailer. Nolan has yet to make a film I did not enjoy. In Nolan we trust!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Slightly concerned. I love Nolan films, but the story seems extremely similar to The Knowing with Nick Cage, which was poop both acting and story."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"By god, they damned well better make it politicaly correct, or there will be hell to pay! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Michael Cains in it so its gonna be good
zSWdZVtXT7E,2014: A Space Odyssey? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This might going to be another Nolan masterpiece. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murphy, I love this detail for the names :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yet again, highly anticipating Nolan's upcoming film. And every time he teams up with Zimmer, I don't just watch his films, I feel them. Can't wait!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I wonder what sort of science fiction this will be 'Contact' style perhaps? Seems character driven.
Though from the trailer it sounds like he's got to go out into the universe and bring something back to save the Earth - not sure about that part. That's a very long trip even at FTL speeds I'm not sure this will be a happy story for all involved. Still looking forward to it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This was a great trailer people say this trailer doesn't give away too much but I think it gives away more than most people realize I the crops on fire scene I think those are his kids grown up and that their dad has been gone for years on that mission and hasn't returned yet
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't care what anyone says, Nolan is the King of 21st century Filmmaking full stop. I haven't been this excited for a movie in a long time, if it's in iMax I will make my way into the city for opening night I swear..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"At first I thought ""Oh god this soundtrack sounds so familiar!"". Then a realized its from V for Vendetta."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looking really good, can't wait!!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait to see this!!  FB page at (twinzdanca)
zSWdZVtXT7E,just nerdgasmed all over my computer
zSWdZVtXT7E,"lol this looks boring as hell and yet their are so many fanboys here worshipping it as if it the second coming of Christ

there was nothing special about this trailer"
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:55 omg! is that....A WARP BUBBLE!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If they don't play ""Major Tom"" at least once during this movie I'm going to be angry."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks maybe neat, but so annoyed at how they keep saying humans are ""meant"", it's like a wave of dumb keeps hitting me in the brain and staggering my enjoyment every time they say it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Eagerly looking forward to the release.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I need the song now!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I know that song in the trailer, but I can't place it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Forget the plot! Nolan plus Zimmer equals AUTOMATIC WIN!!!! Something to look forward to between Godzilla and Hobbit 3 :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,when they are driving they remind me of War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The best thing about Nolan is that he takes full advantage of the medium and uses it the way it should be used.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"No, Don't come back ! boring  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like the music, they borrowed it from V for Vendetta... :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,ehhh..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm sorry. I hate to be the party pooper but this trailer is far from stirring up the anticipation to see it in the theatre. It seems as if it is another movie about man-kind prevailing, while throwing space into the mix. I also am not a fan of Matthew McConaughey. I really hate every movie he has been in. I haven't seen his recent works so I bare that in mind. Many times before have I watched other than stellar trailers with outstanding movies and I hope this is one. I was a big fan of The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception which are the only Nolan directed films I have seen, but as for this trailer, I don't quite see what the hype is about. I might just wait to rent the movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The song without a doubt is from the film V for Vendetta. I believe the song is evey reborn. i always remembered the song cause it was played at the scene when she says ""God is in the rain."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Awesome!!
And the song is from the soundtrack of V for vendetta "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Entering into a black hole!!!....looks more interesting....hope it remains as classy as kubrick's masterpiece!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The worm hole as seen in this trailer is a depiction of Dr. Kip Thorne's theories of a spinning black hole. Kip is a world renowned Caltech Physicist and leader of wormhole theory. Nolan brought him on as an exec prod for the film and He is taking my breath away. Not only does he depict the most realistic future apocalypse with climate change destroying soil and producing dust bowls, but he is giving us a realistic glimpse into real theoretical interstellar travel. This man knows no equal when it comes to truly inspirational a moving tales. As was so eloquently said decade ago, he is ""inspiring the imagination of a generation"". "
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks frickin awesome! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This must be the prequel to Event Horizon?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If whatever shown in the trailer gets over in the first 15 mins of the movie , then we are in for an amazing plot of twists and turns. In one way its good that this trailer has brought down the expectations , but mind you , just to raise it back after the actual movie releases . "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"that black astronaut, too sci-fi for me."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie is borderline on giving someone a heart attack 
zSWdZVtXT7E,509 people want to inherit the Earth while the rest of us explore the universe.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The totem is a little bigger guy for you, darling."
zSWdZVtXT7E,So I'm guessing that Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck are gonna be like the older version of Matthew MaCaugnahey's kids?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks to me like another Liberal agenda movie. Global warming? People, there is absolutely not a splinter of evidence to prove ""Global Warming"" or when its cooling instead of warming ""Climate Change"" which ever is convienient at the time, is caused by MAN. There always was and always will be periods of warming and periods of cooling. The ones pushing this are the ones who stand a chance at making big $$ for it. Come on Hollywood, come back to earth! Had to get that off my chest."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Boriiiiinngggg.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can it be that Hollywood might finally produce at least ONE intellectually stimulating sci-fi movie?
zSWdZVtXT7E,is there any rankings to most viewed movie trailers on youtube? i'm pretty sure this one will easily fit in the top 5...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm going crazy, can't  wait"
zSWdZVtXT7E,So is there gonna be freaking aliens or what? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its incredible even on trailers Nolan movies has exposition. I think that what we saw here is the first chap of the movie. We see only a little of Anne Hatheway and the space. I guess that he dont wont spoil the best parts of the movies. I think also that Chastain will be her daughter. So he  left for a long time. A 2001 wanna be. Sorry for my english
zSWdZVtXT7E,we where not ment to be in space. god gave us earth.
zSWdZVtXT7E,
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am crying like a small kid! T_T
zSWdZVtXT7E,Prediction: He makes it back but his Murphy is old and he's still young. If not I really hope they don't pull some cheap so-fi explanation out of their asses to ignore relativistic time dilation.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The only drawback of this trailer is that they shows... from the director of INCEPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY...... 

.. 
. where are the name of MEMENTO and THE PRESTIGE."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The only drawback of this trailer is that they shows... from the director of INCEPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY...... 

.. 
. where are the name of MEMENTO and THE PRESTIGE."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The teaser was more 'Interstellar' - like. This is exceeding our understandings of regular movie plots, promises to be an awesome picture for sure!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sorry,just not possible. e=mc squared. roadblock big time"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm probably the only one, but I got nothing from this trailer apart from ""meh"" :/ "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Following : Didn't see.
Insomnia : Good, But A remake of a film with the same name.
Batman Begins : Awesome, But copied from Batman The Animated Series
The Prestige : Amazingly done, But adaption of a novel.
The Dark Knight : Marvelous, But over rated.
The Dark Knight Rises : Lame
Inception : Originally Beautiful, But inspired from many films like Dark City.

In short, Nolan is one of the best director, But he's overrated :\

I wish I was wrong, but when I found out these facts by myself, my heart was broken too. :("
zSWdZVtXT7E,Could be good
zSWdZVtXT7E,BLOOD KNEW IT WAS THE BATMAN DIRECTOR THE SECOND I SAW BRUCES SERVANT
zSWdZVtXT7E,Starring: the cast of Batman - The Dark Knight Rises
zSWdZVtXT7E,as long as the main population dies off right? typical pro nwo movie. only they get too travel too the stars.
zSWdZVtXT7E,OOOOOOOOOOHHHH O:
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey + Anne Hathaway + Jessica Chastain + Christopher Nolan + Sci-Fi = I'm sold
zSWdZVtXT7E,Astonishing....!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hmm looks like a time travel movie.I have a hunch that there are two matthew mc conaughey.Maybe they go looking for planets and through the wormhole they travel back in time.This movie reminds me of the parallel universe theories,but in this case they are able to bring both the universe together resulting in maybe time travel.I dont know but the trailer looks awesome,hope the movie would be awesome as well.SCIENCE ROCKS  peace out."
zSWdZVtXT7E,am i the only one around here who's read the script??
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This also, has a Sunshine feel!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So, wait, they're going half way across our galaxy (maybe even beyond) to grow more food!? I know this trailer doesn't explain much, but if they're trying to find a way to find a new planet for colonization and food growing, why don't they just build colonies in orbit? And farms in orbit, on space stations with artificial gravity using the 'wheel' method? Weird.

My point may be invalid, but I do want to watch this..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Whats funny is everytime someone posts a comment they receive 5 or more likes or even about a 100 likes!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"God! I love this! In Nolan we Trust.

Also, the trailer song is from V for Vendetta, Evey Reborn! Priceless!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I always liked Christopher Nolan for having in unrealistic movies be sort of realistic. I was sold on this when I saw that he made the black hole actually look like a real black hole at the end :3
zSWdZVtXT7E,No shot he makes it back.  No shot.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murphy law means it will always goes pear shaped and you cant see it, 50/50 I say heads but I dont mind a few tales in the mix..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murphy law means it will always goes pear shaped and you cant see it, 50/50 I say heads but I dont mind a few tales in the mix..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've been looking forward to this movie ever since it was rumored. There has been so much detail poured into this film and scientific accuracy was strived for in Interstellar. It looks beautiful and awe-inspiring! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Everyone! Do yourselves a favor. Don't look any further into this movie. Try to go in with as little as knowledge as possible. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Great...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks awesome! Can't wait. Don't mean to be a troll or anything, but does it seem to be a bit bad editing in the beginning of the trailer? Specifically thinking of the scenes in the car. From one view he's holding the coffee mug and from another view he's not..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not impressed.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"this trailer is weird. i feel like watching the first 2 acts of the movie, without even knowing what's going on."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well the one fact of human's that never changes, we never do the right thing till after something terrible happens to enough of us.

Want GM to recall the cars? wait till it kills enough women/children and men.

History, all old things are made new again. We never do any good till enough evil is done to us."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"excellent move to time this film's release in November
the Academy can't seem to appreciate movies that were shown before August"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Whats so unique about this film, is that I'm pretty sure most people were sold before the first trailer even came out, let alone this one."
zSWdZVtXT7E,We'll see....
zSWdZVtXT7E,syncopy + christopher nolan = amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,i think this has the best music of any trailer ever made!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I remember the music from v for vendetta.
zSWdZVtXT7E,soundtrack plz ???
zSWdZVtXT7E,why is everyone on christopher nolan's dick
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love how everyone is judging a (more than likely) 2 hour films, from a 2 minute trailer. Watch the film, then judge it. Morons."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Trailer has appeal. What gets me is Nolan using music from ""V for Vendetta"" in the trailer. Check it out, it's called ""Evey Reborn""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I wasn't going to watch this movie, but then i noticed Nolan made this. Nolan = me watch. He's the best director out there. I have yet to watch 1 bad movie of his. He also casts good actors, so i trust his judgment. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Didn't Michael Caine say ""we must confront the reality) twice in this trailer?   This looks very interesting "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A sequel has already been greenlit, call Interstellar 5555, where he returns and speaks of a race of blue-skinned creatures that will accept the human race provided they have an ear for super-catchy, funky, electronic music. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For those who want to know, this is only the first act of the movie. The majority of it will take place in space, travelling through a wormhole to investigate a distant planet in search of a solution to Earths problems. Based on the script there are a few scenes to rival if not top anything seen in Inception. The scene travelling through the wormhole sounds especially mindbending. I can't wait to see how they do it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks good but if the whole film hes with the kids talking about how the world ran out of food, i dont think im interested, but the soundtrack the music looks good"
zSWdZVtXT7E,We must think not as individuals..but as a Species. We must confront the reality of Interstellar traffic !! Cant wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mind Blowing
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Meh.. Humans should just die out and get it over with, worst species ever."
zSWdZVtXT7E,He will come back and everyone on Earth will be already dead.
zSWdZVtXT7E,we must confront the reality that nothing in our solar system can help us! Epic
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Everthing is on earth human bean that need, the almight create earth with everything human bean needed to live and survive. so i dont know where they going  i guess they want a up close a look at the stars .."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Best movie of the year anyone?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is like contact 2! Just without Jodie Foster!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am sold... For some reason I was expecting more space travel on the first trailer. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Handsome male lead? Check. Male lead needing to get through some personal barrier? Check. Family issues? Check. Good, but simple, plot padded-up to psuedo intellectual level? Check. Right, time for a new Nolan movie.
PS. The Prestige is still his best work. Interstellar will either be the new Prometheus, or he really will make a brilliant science fiction film. We shall see..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm soo gonna watch dis movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,SPACE COWBOY..
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope the drama-on-earth part of the movie is short and the sci-fi-space-time-travel part is long
zSWdZVtXT7E,yet another retarded quasi science fiction flick... Hollywood should be banned from making them because they degrade the real science...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Movie of the decade.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity: Part Two
zSWdZVtXT7E,watched he movie in 2.54mins thanks! it was pretty good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Now thats a movie ! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,who can possibly say 'no' to Nolan's imagination?!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I Love Matthew Mcconaughey.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Best Film Of The Year.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan Is A Genius
zSWdZVtXT7E,batman is that u
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love the idea of interstellar travelling,  wormholes etc. But what I don't understand is all this (almost cheesy and cliché) Hollywood drama around the main character. Why send a family man to space? What's so special about this man? Aren't there enough engineers who prepared themselves all their lives for this? I was thinking of a character like Ripley in Alien... I think this drama annoys me because it gets in the way of the sci-fi part of the story..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,It looks interesting.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Whatever Christopher Nolan movie is, I will sure gonna watch it. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan really needs to stop making films
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks pretty amazing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"0:06

Solar sails only provide thrust
do they mean solar arrays? sci-fi is stupid"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"min 1:00 ""We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it""

Nolans giving us our marching orders. Break out of this prison planet!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks great and with Nolan command i bet this is gonna be an awsome movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,It look good but I think people will say is a ripoff of gravity
zSWdZVtXT7E,"People complaining that they don't know the plot from the trailer, saying it's bad cause of it....

NEWS FLASH: THAT MEANS IT'S A GOOD TRAILER. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,пиздато
zSWdZVtXT7E,it's scary 1:54 O_o
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really hope the movie will use real physics....my brain can't handle inaccuracies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow, this trailer makes the movie look a lot better than that teaser that originally came out.  And it was driving me crazy for a minute thinking, where have I heard that music before?  Then I remembered it's VERY similar to the music in V for Vendetta.  Same composer for this one, I'd bet."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think I've figured out the story:

He's a cosmic bus driver.  His mission is to deliver a group of volunteers (spaceship with all those pods) to a predetermined planet beyond our solar system via the wormhole.  Drop them off to populate the new planet over time to have our species continue to survive. Plant the seed sort of speak.  He intends on coming back but who knows if and how long through time it will take.  Earth is doomed.  Our generation and a few beyond it will eventually die out. 

Also, M.M. always wears the same jacket.  The woman in the shot who I assume to be his older daughter is also wearing the same jacket.  Hmmm..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Jupiter Ascending, Edge of Tomorrow, Godzilla and now this?

Sorry, but I have no money for view all"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A true Nolan Movie !
Movie of the Year without doubt !"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spaghettification.
zSWdZVtXT7E,That moment 2:05 to 2:08. whoohooff...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks really good and it got me excited, but is it just me or does the boardroom scene look like they just used the same set as in Dark Knight lol "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ha ha, same goofy stars flying by the window effect from Star Trek. How fast does that ship travel? ... a gazillion light years per hour?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music: 'Evey Reborn' - V for Vendetta :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks exciting considering this article that I just read, on yesterday, considering that the super-massive black hole at the center of our galaxy may in fact be a wormhole. 

https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/bb5ae64fa4fa"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm guessing it's gonna be 2 1/2 hours. 2 hours of 1 dimensional characters dealing with problems on Earth. Last half hour of actual space stuff. Calling it now. If I'm wrong and it's a good movie then awesome. I'm sure Nolan fanboys will like it no matter what.
zSWdZVtXT7E,trailer offers so little..
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks good 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Scientifically accurate = win
zSWdZVtXT7E,I call upon the @Auralnauts to spice up this trailer. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another AVATAR-like movie with absolutely unneccessary anti-science giberish. The world doesn't need engineers? Do you understand that IS travel would require enough energy for us to a)grow hydrophonic food for hundreds of BNs of people or b) making enough glucose out of CO2 a H2O via electrolysis? It is the equivalent of building a 747 inside a starving african village just to fly to NYC to buy food. And steering wheel in a car? WTF? You didn't need that for a story. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is only from the first 15 minutes 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh a  apocalypse movie with a winy little girl haven't seen those before  (sarcasm) 
zSWdZVtXT7E,What if the movie ends with the ship getting sucked into the black hole.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Five years ago I would have been like, ""Eww, Matthew McConaughey?"", but now I'm like ""Awesome, Matthew McConaughey!"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If the new Transformers movie makes more money than this, I will lose all faith in humanity."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yep. Gonna watch it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,What does the girl say at 1:16? I can't quite make it out
zSWdZVtXT7E,Indeed. #Interstellar
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer is already better than gravity.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ship comes straight from Icarus/White Engine.  A football shape spaceship surrounded by 1 or 2 rings.  So, they're looking to create a space warp bubble.  It's not a 1 way mission, not an occuring wormhole, it's meant to be self generated."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hello there warp drive 1:53 .
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks brilliant, an intellectual sci-fi movie with impressive visuals , a great cast, an amazing director, this will be flawless."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I Love theis 
zSWdZVtXT7E,.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"yae
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So instead of trying to clean the Earth,from pollution that Humanity did, home of our civilization,that we should care and protect,humanity decide to find another planet like Earth,wich I doubt will be sitting and waiting just for us,because you know....,there might be already someone living there,but noo lets just get another planet to screw up again,yaay,why not?,we can do this forever. Until Humanity doesn't learn to care about the planets they live on,they won't have a future in space. nonetheless the Trailer looks interesting I hope the movie will have some lessons to learn from it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,propaganda
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Right because interstellar space travel is way easier then planting new corn.

0/10 Fail!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity 2?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't wait. Looks like the perfect movie to watch when Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth comes out. Thanks for the great entertainment, guys!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,All the people thinking the warp scene is right before the credits..the hell is wrong with you?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Trailers always misleading! 
But the idea that Matthew is the movie star makes me curious about this upcoming movie ."
zSWdZVtXT7E,sick
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan + Kaine, better love story than twilight :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,something tells me he is going into the past..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I am very excited for this, i have never been more excited for a trailer like this one, even more than any other movie coming out. I just hope its not a action movie, where people are dying and things a re blowing up. But an actual explorer movie through space. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Maybe they go through a wormhole and end up back in time and then stop mankind from polluting the Earth or some other such mumbo jumbo?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks good!!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The backstory to every good shmup, you're a little late 'merica."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The sound track is good 
zSWdZVtXT7E,The trailer itself is amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dammit D:
zSWdZVtXT7E,So that's why that guy left true detective
zSWdZVtXT7E,Time dilation. Mcconaughey goes through a wormhole for a few minutes and comes back to find that many years have passed on earth.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Throws money at the screen.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Doesn't quite grip me like the trailer for Gravity did, but sure, I'll check this out - just hope the acting is as good as it was in Buyers club... "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks quite good  he was a great actor in public enemys and  batman 1,2 so this film looks great and wih him it should be an awesome film "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have absolutly no fucking idea what the fuck i just saw.... They are out of food but they live in a farm? The world is ending but they still playing baseball and shit. What? Indian drones flying around for no reason on what looks to be american soil. Bwhat the actuall fuck is this.

Why are people saying they love this and that it is awesome? Its literally the worst trailer ive ever seen. Im confused as fuck. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wish Nolan would direct Star Trek movies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan never fails, i have no doubt that this will be the Movie of this Year."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Chris nolan???? Sold :D cant wait!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks like a really good movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can i book my tickets already??
zSWdZVtXT7E,"From what's already been said, I know absolutely diddly dick about what this film is about and I'm not even going to try to guess. Whether this film turns out to be a piece of shit, an average film or a masterpiece, I'd be damned if this didn't feel cinematic. This is why I go to the movies and love them so very much."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alfred!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Booo! Looks shit 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks promising. But I thought the same when I watched the trailer of Transcendence a couple of months ago. That movie was kinda hyped but it turned out to be a bummer.. let's hope Interstellar will do better :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well that was shit. Nolan you fucking hack
zSWdZVtXT7E,Man if Nolan did a Suikoden film OMG
zSWdZVtXT7E,The warp drive even looks like the way they said it would need to be :D 
zSWdZVtXT7E,2 millions in one day
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Man !!!
They revealed all the suspence :(
Anyways.... still desperate."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I am excited for this movie BUT I will still be waiting for a Mass Effect film adaptation.If not the story of the trilogy of video games.Then , a prequel about the First Contact War.For those who've never played the games, the prequel story goes like this:Man  goes to Mars in the 2140s, discovers the technology of an Ancient more advanced civilization,that tech jumps human tech 200 years forward and helps man achieve FTL travel , man travels beyond and discovers the Mass Relays(which are literally portals that ""sling"" you from one point in the galaxy to another in a matter of seconds), man decides to go beyond that mass relay and comes face to face with a new alien race and all this nearly cause a war /diplomatic episode etc etc I . It would be such a cool film.Sci-fi/Exploration/Adventure/Political Thriller.Not the typical ""aliens invade earth to exterminate us"" plot.Someone pleaaase make this happen!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's a wormhole
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cornball
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks crap
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow! What a Trailer!! *-*
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks like an awesome movie but it's terrifying how accurate the implication is that it'll take near extinction to finally get humanity to contemplate undertaking interstellar travel
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wonder if there will be aliens close to the end or smthing... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Not enough food""... riiiight. Today, we could feed twice the population we have. Each year we waste up to 2 billion tonnes of food. Wheres your screenplay now?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Isn't the backing track from V for Vendetta? Evey Reborn?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This literally sent chills through my whole body. How amazing would it be to travel through a worm hole. I can only imagine......maybe one day. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,WORMHOLE. SOLD.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The best part is that this is all probably footage from just the first hour. Thanks for not spoiling anything and please keep it up
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yes. As long as it's a good time too.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"continuation of the species with anne hathaway onboard, what a dream..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"How ironic to get this trailer as publicity when watching Dario Marianelli's ""Evey Reborn"" (V for Vendetta).
Kinda dissapointed to not have heard an original soundtrack from Interstellar itself :-("
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another Oscar for Matthew?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Im surprised at the hate Nolan is getting, just by reading some of the comments, :o"
zSWdZVtXT7E,My best guess of the plot is that they invent some special kind of space/time travel which involves them going into stasis for a long period of time and when they wake up they find themselves somewhere they didn't expect and crazy stuff will happen. - best plot estimate ever!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just me guys? but this trailer isnt amazing as I thought! but thats a good thing cause I know the film will be good
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait to see the How it Should have Ended for this
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow this looks sooo good
zSWdZVtXT7E,That was dope! Bring on the McConnaissance!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan's Alpha Centauri/Beyond Earth.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'd love to come back in another 10.000 years time and see what we have achieved.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Bad movies really aren't Nolan's thing
zSWdZVtXT7E,Since True Detective i want to see absolutely everything with McConaughey in it. Nolan directing certainly helps. :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Im feelin this trailer kna meeean?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This. Looks. Amazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,prequel to avatar???
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think that jassica chastain is the the girl from this trailer when she gets older at 1:40
zSWdZVtXT7E,sunshine meets contact?
zSWdZVtXT7E,the song remind me of V for Vendetta in God is in the rain scene 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"YEEEESSS The trailer tells us NOTHING about the movie's main plot, yet Alfred is there, Mathew is there, Anne Hathaway is there... and Nolan is there. Oh don't forget the name: Interstellar. I can't wait."
zSWdZVtXT7E,57seconds in batman impression
zSWdZVtXT7E,"its not cheesy and full of special effects

plus is has really good actors in it.

matt mcconaghey and relationship with his kids looks important...i think this movie will be awesome.

i can sense another academy nomination for matt..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,NOLAN HATERS please do not bother and stay on earth; BELIEVERS please have a seat and get ready for an INTERSTELLAR travel.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't really like this idea....just give up on Earth and ruin another planet? Okay?
zSWdZVtXT7E,anything is possible.. i don't believe this is a sci-fi movie. I believe interstellar travel will be reality one day
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks good and interesting, not cheesy and unoriginal like prometheus or pacific rim.

matt mcconaghey really is the best actor in the world at the moment, good to see him front the movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I miss wally pfister's Cinematography :( ...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Total feels. This looks fantastic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that emma stone? :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta Theme! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Almost every film Nolan has directed has ended up one of my favorites, so I plan to see this day one. But at the same time, this trailer didn't really do anything for me."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Not to be ""that guy"" here, but doesn't Jupiter look a little small when the ship is flying towards the rings? Like... scale-wise, Jupiter looks smaller than Earth. Unless the ship is hella far away but it looks like it's a lot closer. Who knows. We'll find out in November!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Loving the V for Vendetta song
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone recognized the V for Vendetta track from the trailer?

It's from when the police officer dreams V's plan with a hitch... It was a great scene."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Epic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I still have no idea what this film is about...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait to see
zSWdZVtXT7E,I kind off feel like crying now. :'  )
zSWdZVtXT7E,awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,The musical score is totally from V for Vendetta.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Movie of the year of course.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait to see this movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The sounds coming from Elon Musk house - ""fap, fap, fap""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,hmm..lets see..some movie guy decided lets take Space Cowboys and Armageddon and put them both together.  How original!   Is Hollywood serious here - that no one is going to be able to tell.  Im guessing its going to flop - then again people like this mathew mccaughna dude..so the reviews might actually be kind and get people to want to see it.  I've already seen it...in 2 different movies DOH!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Enough with the label ""Sci-Fi""... interstellar travel will happen whenever we start thinking as a ""species"" rather than individuals... It's time to confront reality... "
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is the movie i have wanted someone to make my whole life and its by one of my favorite directors and starring one of my favorite actors. oh fuck yeah
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait 
zSWdZVtXT7E,this preview gave away pretty much the entire plot of the story
zSWdZVtXT7E,So they are going into a black hole right ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Toy Story 2 was ok
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am Sold !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hopefully it won't be a huge disappointment like Transcendence. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"OK is it just me, or did they just reveal at the end of the trailer he uses a blackhole's  gravitational pull to accelerate near/past the speed of light? I'm okay with that, as long as they don't travel through a blackhole/wormhole(that would be cheesy IMO). :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan Is the one and only person who can honestly make a sci-fi that will match up to 2001: A Space Odyssey, Fingers crossed that This Is It."
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's all an elaborate ruse to get Matthew McConaughey off the planet
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So, I watched this first on my phone, and then on the computer.

WATCH IT ON A LARGE SCREEN!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Great, thanks for letting me know I have to wait until November to watch this. Lol"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome.  That's got to be the song from V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,"They seem to have worked out the visual of the black hole very neatly.
I hope they remain consistent when they explain the physics. 
I don't mean ""realism"", it's SciFi, so just consistency in the physical explanations"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'll certainly be waiting for Neil Degrasse Tyson to explain all scientific errors in this movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looking forward to seeing this one :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,did anne hathaway and her joker-like smile have to be cast in this movie. she is so smug and petty.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The Trailer music is picked up from ""V For Vendetta"" , titled ""Evey Reborn""...& All I could picture while watching this trailer was a bald Natalie Portman :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"One day, we will go beyond this world"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I got chills. This looks amazing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ser bra ut!
zSWdZVtXT7E,2:05 looks like the end of the movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,I swear the music in the trailer is from V for Vendetta...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait
zSWdZVtXT7E,the wormhole was found after we dumped Chuck Norris' ashes in space
zSWdZVtXT7E,Epic SF is back in town....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow I thought I was watching a preview to the second season of True Detective in the first 5 seconds.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is the boss! Seriously waiting for this movie!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Fuck you, Alfred! Go help Batman fight Superman!! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,So what is this about? They could explain the plot in the trailer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awesome!!!............can't wait to see this one. It will be superb like his previous movies for sure. Trailer gives just a glimpse of a plot and that’s really smart. I think Nolan will deliver the master piece in the world of space- time travel movies like we have never seen before on celluloid.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan!, you're my boy blue"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That scene with the daughter is heartbreaking. I have a feeling the trip they are about to take is a one way ride. Movie looks fantastic, can't wait for it!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,concept resembles that of 2012 - leave this planet to go to another to survive doomsday on earth
zSWdZVtXT7E,7 nov? my god why so long 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ah, smoke and mirrors, ya gotta love Hollyweird. Published yesterday, almost 2 million views and 14 thousand likes. By my calculations, that's almost 2,000 views a minute. I've been here and refreshed repeatedly and it's gone up less then 30 views in ten minutes. The one to say ""bullshit"" the loudest wins. What exactly *won't* people do for money?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We weren't meant to save it. We were meant to leave it."" I hope this movie includes how wrong that is. Leave? Sure. Save? Definitely."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"one great thing about nolan movies are the carefully-placed clues in the trailers. they don't just show you the most exciting action/dramatic shots, they show you what you're supposed to think about before going to the theaters"
zSWdZVtXT7E,So in Nolan verse india on top? We cant get that aggressive. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Trailer was awesome,focussing more on family n relationships.
I think Cooper's(Matthew McConaughey) daughter Murph is Jessica Chastain in the future(redhead and she's wearing cooper's coat).So i guess the narrative will jump back and forth in time. Can't wait to see the movie. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,If he goes through the wormhole before the hour mark then color me interested.  If the final scene of the trailer is the final scene of the movie then I pass.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music is from V for Vendetta. Was it from anywhere before that?
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Best picture 2015,Best actor Matthew McConaghy.Best Supportting actress,Best Director. Done. (Drops Mic)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yeah um... if you are traveling into deep space to look for other planets, don't promise your kids you're coming back because you aren't. I hope Nolan studied up on physics and things like time dilation... "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Imagine this being only the first 10 mins of the movie - we are in for a ride !!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"McConaughey is gonna return to earth having not aged, but his daughter (now older) will wind up being Jessica Chastain and his son (also older) will be Casey Affleck. Nothing to back that up with but my brain :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is about SpaceX and Elon Musk in a few decades.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"this is Sci-Fi movie who directed by Christopher Nolan and the soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer.
I'm done."
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the trailes events i think its just in the beginning of the movie 
and looks inspired by 2001 Space Odessy"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Matthew McConaughey getting movies left and right recently , after the dallas buyers club and wolf of wall street"
zSWdZVtXT7E,CGI's gonna blow my socks off
zSWdZVtXT7E,YEAH MICHAEL KANE IS IN THIS
zSWdZVtXT7E,"looks like another movie that gets off to a very slow and boring start and by the time it starts to get exciting, they are out of time and have to rush the ending or leave the ending out completely...less running around on a farm and hugging your kids and MORE sci fi (with an emphasis on applied science) and space and aliens!!! We get it you are a family man and love your kids, we dont need 90 minutes of it...I can almost feel the ending of this movie will be as bad as Contact or Misson to Mars...ugh"
zSWdZVtXT7E,So... orange..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Tbh i really don't like this trailer. I'm sure the movie will be great, but they gave away too much, and i think the first teaser trailer did a much better job of getting me pumped to see the movie. Showing them in space was a mistake, they should have left that for the movie. I want to be wowed. Hope it delivers!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,“The world doesn't need more engineers” LOL more like the  world has too many engineers. Besides that the graphics are beautiful
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like how in this movie the depression/dust bowl (a future version anyway) and the interstellar space age are not decades, but mere miles apart.  It kinda reminds you that the old always coexists with the new."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"all i can comment is ""cant wait to see it.' Nolan hasnt let me down and im sure there is no ""yet"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The beginning of this trailer is rubbish, what poor editing!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan was born on earth. But he was never meant to be worshiped here. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,collectivists
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks like it can be a very beautiful story I hope it wont disappoint.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music sounded like it was from V for Vendetta. When Evey is standing in the rain after her jail time. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,wtmotherfuck...i have been waiting and waiting. i know everything about this movie and this is ALL THEY SHOW....M.M. travels through a wormhole and that's it!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,It Looks Meh...
zSWdZVtXT7E,i want to watch it! now!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"type this in the youtube search bar wont regret it :
Afrojack - Dynamite (audio only) ft. Snoop Dogg"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This kind of reminds me of ""Another Earth"". It's a sci-fi film where the focus isn't the sci-fi stuff, but just humanity.

Anyway, I don't believe humans can run out of food before discovering the technology to sustain everyone. We just need to get rid of money, religion, & other useless stuff, so we can focus on the most important things to furthering mankind's existence. All-in-all, I don't think it'll matter if we all did just die on this planet... we kinda think that we're way too special. As long as it isn't from Earth exploding, nature will do just fine without us... there are tons of life at the bottom of the ocean that can exist in space, heat, etc. They'll eventually, most likely, evolve into some other being like us billions of years from now."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's the trailer song please.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is the film I've been waiting for since I can't even remember.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Too many people think about saving the world - mostly by fault of womens' egocentrism. The best way to improve the world around you which in turn improves your life is to work under the system you are located in and build your life there. Worry about yourself more than others' and focus on what you're doing. And remember, you're not always helping."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall a sleep LOL"
zSWdZVtXT7E,instant classic
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan = High Anticipation
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Fantastic ""V for Vendetta""-Score!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I know it's a very different story, but the fact that it's Matthew McConaughey in a movie that centers around space travel, (possible) wormholes, and a father-daughter relationship, kind of makes me really think of the 1997 film ""Contact"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow. This is what I love about Nolan. He can put a trailer out there that shows us what the film is somewhat about but still leave us craving a whole lot more. And that music only Hans Zimmer can create. Something tells me this one is going to be filled with a lot of emotion, especially for those of us that are parents since they are highlighting the father/daughter relationship. November can't come soon enough for me. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"*am i the only one that thinks, wormholes are only possible through star gates sorta thing or omega relay's like mass effect , i don't believe in warp speed, or at least not for another 200-1000 years*"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Saw this trailer before Godzilla. It came out of NOWHERE. So excited for a real space adventure. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,It's look like an awesome movie... ! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Its about climate change and humanity's last ditch attempt to survive and then FAILED horribly in the end. Humans are too stupid and evil to deserve this planet, just die already. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did Christopher Nolan wrote all his stuff at Starbucks?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goosebumps!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is Matthews time to shine.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool! Nolan's the man!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well it's about interstellar space travel. Lol. But the Prestige was about magic. Inception was about dreams. Ect. There's always a little more to his movies.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this trailer kinda reminds me of man of steel which fucking sucked. i hope this movie doesen't disappoint.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Pretty obvious what the plot is.. ""..Nothing in the solar system can help us."" So they build a ship to fly to another universe/world system and see if there's anything there that can save Earth since physics in another universe may be different. Apparently they found a wormhole next to Saturn to travel there so yea.. I don't think it was meant to repopulate humans as you need a specific number to reproduce the species, and a few hundred isn't gonna cut it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Finally, a movie about Daft Punk's Interstellar adventure in sector 555. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not sure what this will be about....but it looks awesome. I trust Nolan. Hasn't let me down yet.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like we're going to be getting something on the level of 2001: a space odyssey or Contact in terms of ideas/ messages, themes, and quality of execution. Maybe even better, you never know what Nolan can surprise you with in his movies.

Judging from this trailer alone, ill definitely be watching when it comes out."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have to see this movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,Space bubble ftw.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think the first trailer was better.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why is this only being shown in UK cinemas? :(
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I remember when ppl watched this trailer at IMAX, everyone was so quiet and focused til the end. Goosebumps everywhere. Can't wait! 😊"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Bravo!!! This looks like it's going to be a masterpiece!
zSWdZVtXT7E,November!! Ahh!
zSWdZVtXT7E,LOL! I swear Michael Cain is like the ultimate oracle or something; with every movie he makes with Christopher Nolan he always plays a character that is some sort of a guide to the main character and I have a feeling that's his role in this movie (which I have no problem with at all). It's just something I've noticed. I really can't wait for this one!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just don't know if I can go back into space again after Gravity....
zSWdZVtXT7E,This could end up being a Nolanesque version of the Contact(1997) which also had McConaughey with Kip Thorne as scientific advisor.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Aigh, aigh, aigh, I personally personally think we should take our shirts off before we go in this wormhole"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Who thinks Nolan should pull a Whedon and run DC Universe? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is at it again!
zSWdZVtXT7E,everyone is dead by the time he comes back from that space travel lol.
zSWdZVtXT7E,reddit sent me hear
zSWdZVtXT7E,Fart
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks really interesting but i can't help being distracted that the trailer stole the music from V for vendetta 'Evey reborn'
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Does he say ""Indian surveillance drone"" at 00:04??????"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Am i wrong or am i hearing the song from V for Vendetta? when Eve is standing in the rain?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just can't wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"OK, so...what's happening to earth this time on this movie ???"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yet another silly Hollywood mess that demonstrates a complete ignorance of science and how it would be applied to avert crisis. Set to the tune of millions of wasted dollars.

If we run into the problem of critical food shortage, and we very well may, a more prudent solution would be to apply vertical farms. There are nations out there building them today. (Sadly, none of those nations are America.) We wouldn't wait until the problem has created a global dust-bowl dystopia then send a single crew to another planet. That solution, while it makes for pretty visuals and an entertaining, if silly story, is asinine.

I encourage people genuinely concerned with global food shortage to check out vertical farming, and particularly a book written by Mr. Diamandis and Mr. Kotler entitled: ""Abundance"".

I'll see this movie in theaters, but I'll bring my own grain of salt."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"sigh the plot sounds too dumb, not realistic at all. Wormholes? give me a break. No such thing, and do these directors really expect metal to hold up against something our brightest scientists can't even explain? Seems like a good popcorn ride but i expect more from a christopher nolan."
zSWdZVtXT7E,That V For Vendetta soundtrack tho
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This film should have been titled ""BASED MATTHEW SAVES THE WORLD"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"this look sick, the way that the ship distorts the space-time to travel faster than light, beutiful"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"pffft, doesn't need Engineers, who do you think will maintain that craft once it's operational? Casper? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,The soundtrack is actually Evey Reborn from V for Vendetta not The Dominoes Fall
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't suspend disbelief that Matthew McConaughey can act long enough to enjoy this trailer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow,  wasn't expecting it to be in November. This is the first time I've heard about this movie. I thought this was a summer movie. XD"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The soundtrack reminds me of 'Meet Joe Black'
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Trying to trust Nolan, but so far this looks incredibly boring. I sure hope its better than that turd Gravity"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For those of you who enjoyed the song its called ""Evey Reborn"" and its from the V for Vendetta sountrack. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,wouldn't be a christopher nolan film without michael caine :p
zSWdZVtXT7E,"soundtrack is ""evey reborn"" from the movie ""v for vendetta"" by  Dario Marianelli"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Fake 
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Best Movie This Year !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is gonna be the modern 2001 Space Odyssey. At least regarding the effect it will have on its audiences. Love the casting, and the director thats behind it. Whats great is that the concept in this movie isn't a far fetched reality. Who knows what the human race will have to do to survive. Plus, we get to venture into the cosmos in a way we haven't yet. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It's like if Nolan took the best elements of a Spielberg's awe inspiring, Kubrics's philosophical intrigue and his own style and made this amazing looking piece of cinema. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'd love to share the sentiment that we weren't meant to die here but then I'd have to believe in purpose... which is unbelievable. Still excited for this. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is going to be unbelievable..calling a McConaughey golden globe or oscar
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i'll wait this trailer, i wait November, we all wait November...Christopher Nolan the best dicrector in modern world!!!!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,He's not coming back 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Knew I recognised that music - it's from v for vendetta.
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan we trust.
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks stupid
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We were meant to leave it""
Wrong! We were meant to take care of this planet!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"How lame! Engineers make the tools that make food!
""The world doesn't need any engineers"" - What a joke. Just more a-hole trying to put down my profession."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This film is going to be life-alteringly good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So you can achieve interstellar travel but you can't manage to keep feeding humans? there's something wrong with the future of the planet in this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks great
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want to go to there.
zSWdZVtXT7E,He not comin back...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where is Anne Hathaway ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This generation's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did anyone else notice that the music in the trailer was recycled from the score of V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Damn that roar of Godzilla, gives me chills"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The sound track playing in this for anyone who's interested is ""Evey Reborn"" originally from the film ""V for Vendetta"" which is why for some of you it may sound familiar."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oooh their moving to another universe to save themselves this could be interesting...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Proclaiming to be wise...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sounds like a cut off the 'V for Vendetta' soundtrack, used in this trailer. Good choice!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"can you say OSCAR NUMBER 2!?

Alllright Alllllllright allllllllllllllllllllllllright!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer does it again. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Are they entering a wormhole at the end? What happens at 2:06? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is a master of visual and emotional scope. Even the notion of what this movie appears to be exploring--the fear and conviction of putting your life on the line to find out what's on the other side of the known universe--is awe inspiring and Nolan certainly has the talent to put it on screen. November cannot come soon enough!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like another cinematography heavy movie but fucks up physics and logic. Chris Nolan is a good director, horrible writer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,spoiler: he doesnt come back
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why there is music from V for vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan>Cuaron
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan's made quality stuff. Space movies are fun. Don't know if I'm the only one, but this doesn't seem solid to me as a final product. Pretty to look at, and it's trying to be deep, but it is pretty cliche at the end of the day. Obviously we don't know for sure either way till it comes out. Oh well, glad it's going to make a lot of people entertained. ;) [2 cents deposited] "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks interesting but instellar space travel is physically impossible.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"
SO NOT IMPRESSED.

    Jeez! Did Nolan stop smoking his cigar with his fellow gentlemen, to not realize his silly ideas in this film. Clearly, he is just another armchair philosopher. Nolan is just whipping his dick out now. Smh. 

1) The timing for this movie is way off. The characters look like they live in a very near future, BUT the technology being used to travel through black holes is not even close to reality.

2) Humanity is converging and things like stopping the population growth would be acted on way before there was no more food. Plus science will grow food way before humanity can travel long distances through space. Smh.

3) In the future when humanity might act on such a desperate decision, THEY as ""we humanity"" will not resemble a person today. Biology, science, transhumanism, the singularity will all transform the human race.

THIS IS A SILLY MOVIE, but it will probably have some cool ass scenes though :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This isn't about wormhole's or blackhole's the spaceship in the video seems to use a warp drive, and the visual effects of bending space are what you might expect things to look if NASA is successful with thier warp drive project - http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/164326-nasa-discusses-its-warp-drive-research-prepares-to-create-a-warp-bubble-in-the-lab
The currently proposed spacecrafts to warp space have torus rings around them, just like the spacecraft in the vid. Also NASA has estimated with a warp drive compressing space in front of the craft and expanding it behind the craft we could travel to Alpha Centauri, the nearest solar system in 2 weeks to 2-3 months. So in all likelihood the space travelers in this film would come back from a successful trip relatively soon. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awesome :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,it's the end of the world and we should find a new planet to survive and sustain our species - thats the plot . looks damn majestic
zSWdZVtXT7E,"C Nolan+ McConaughey +Space, Mind=blown"
zSWdZVtXT7E,majestic
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yes! Yes! Yes! Love it!
Would be better if Anne Hathaway wasn't in it though."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ay sup Saturn
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love the fact that Nolan brought back some older Dark Knight actors. Is that Anne Hathaway?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Heavy breathing
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is already a thousand times more interesting of a space travel-themed movie than Gravity was ever going to be. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I think it was sweet and unique that the ""I love you"" was to his daughter and not a romantic love interest."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, that's all I need to hear. A sci fi by Nolan, this is going to be a masterpiece."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler alert : he dies :p
zSWdZVtXT7E,looking forward to this
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gives me goosebumps. Wonder if its like Tau Zero with lots of time dilation paradoxes.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I am an Engineer, and I approve this Trailer!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Eve online Wormhole vs SOE Ship :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,BIOSHOCK INFINITE MOVIE SEXY VERSION
zSWdZVtXT7E,Damn!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If you think Christopher Nolan is overrated then you're a fuckin moron. Name one other Hollywood director that works with massive budgets yet still somehow manages to create cerebral, heady and intelligent films on par with Nolan's. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,get in line behind me
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why isn't Neil Degrasse Tyson the captain?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm guessing there's time dilation and Jessica Chastain is older Murphy? In any case looking forward to it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this the sci-fi/drama movie we all been waiting for?..
zSWdZVtXT7E,"He is not coming back, it''ll serve as fuel his remaining life, and then he will discover some catch to that and then sacrifice himself. Everyone else will die. Calling it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I for one am glad that the movie wasn't spoiled by the trailer. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Even under Nolan's direction, I don't think I could buy Matthew McConaughey as an engineer."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music... nice choice.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wait a second... did hollywood just make something ORIGINAL... that might be GOOD...that isn't based on a BOOK or REALITY? When was the last time that happened?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"As soon as i heard michael caine's voice: ""yep, i'm going to see this."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan, I am proud of you."
zSWdZVtXT7E,lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,"They should name this movie ""Rust Cohle going to space"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,*nerdgasm*
zSWdZVtXT7E,Environmental propaganda from Hollywood never gets old.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that Renessme?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Movie makers: We're sending you to space...with beer...and porn.
Matthew McConaughey: Alright alright alright!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Perfect. This is how trailers should be made, enough to get our interest but not show us the whole plot. Take note SONY this is how the masters do it"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This soundtrack starting from 1:15 is so familiar. Does anyone know what's it's name? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Michael Cain's voice and a musical score like this go hand in hand.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Being a space enthusiast, I would've loved for this movie to focus more on interstellar travel rather than family love. From this trailer it just seems like the same movie formula but with a space backdrop."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"God damn it, this looks like another liberal global warming capitalism is evil movie "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan's best works capture the best of both style and story. When he doesn't get caught up in exposition, his movies transcend. This trailer is absolutely perfect -- it doesn't give too much away, but it showcases the characters and a glimpse of a very intriguing story plot. I hope he can deliver, and I hope this movie makes us question humanity's place in the universe, and the power we have to change for the better. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks really cool. I love this type of stuff, it reminded me of Kerbal Space Program lol"
zSWdZVtXT7E,So i'm guessing that space ship don't need any engineers it needs a farmer right lol.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"
I don't know. I'm somewhat intrigued by this movie, but not really blown away by this trailer, and the premise overall. Might just wait till it's out on video or a movie channel.

What does excite me is the news this week that Ridley Scott & crew, including Harrison Ford will be making a sequel to Blade Runner. Risky move though, tampering with a classic like BR."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm thinking Jessica Chastain will play the aged daughter of McConaughey due to the relativity factor of faster than light travel? Either way really excited for this Nolan film...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw the first trailer, now I need to see it right now"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The multiverse, hell yeah!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm ready to have my mind blown
zSWdZVtXT7E,murph is sadly going to be disappointed when he doesn't come back
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hopefully it's a better story than Gravity. Gravity had fantastic visuals, but god awful acting and a bad plot. I really hope this is better."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Thanks Hollywood for Mathew Mcdoushey whether we like him or not.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This better have the balls to be the next 2001
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I started play kerbal space program, and then I went onto youtube to queue up some music. Then this caught my eye, how appropriate."
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks good. now I want to know if they are a advance team scouting for a possible new home. or are they planing on using the wormhole as a time machine?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If this is better than ""Gravity"" (that shouldn't be too hard), then I will be IMMENSELY happy."
zSWdZVtXT7E,What?!?! No HAL???? You can't go into deep space without HAL!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Finally!!! I've been waiting for this trailer for a year. Micheal Cain, Matthew McCaughnahey. Love Christopher Nolan movies."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is called a warp drive
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie-story will impact the world; except in U.S. where the Republicans have a death wish for us and the planet so they can go ""heaven""; sick and twisted like Taliban."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Thinking of Armageddon as i watch this trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,<can't wait to see that movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,He ain't coming back. Kinda messed up to lie to your daughter like that.
zSWdZVtXT7E,How bout making a Tim Tebow movie. That'll bring in millions.
zSWdZVtXT7E,wooooo mega sandstorm like in spec ops the line ^-^
zSWdZVtXT7E,Doesn't look that interesting tbh
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not to Watch this when high… 0_o
zSWdZVtXT7E,I still have no idea what this movie is about!
zSWdZVtXT7E,i know nothing about this movie and i love that
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We don't need more engineers we ran out of food not machines"", to that I say, engineers can help with that also. Agricultural/Genetic/Biomedical engineering and even mechanical engineering all contribute to forward development; even as it relates to food and the environment. It's just a matter of channeling talent, skills and abilities in the right direction. But hey, Hollywood is full of dreamers...not engineers."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I am not a ""In Nolan we trust"" fake fan boy.....but I think this looks good. I appreciate what no one really talks about and that is Nolans style as a filmmaker due to his lack of flashy bullshit and resistance (it seems) to be derivative."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Using black holes to travel through space they probably dead.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm okay to go!. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What's this?  Another Interstellar trailer that doesn't give away the entire first, second, and third acts?  Genius!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone else notice that they used the same music that was played during V for Vendetta's most pivotal scene?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yes !!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,b movie crap
zSWdZVtXT7E,What's song in background? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"sounds like its going to have a winning soundtrack, beautiful music."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan and Mathew McConaughey in a scifi  movie epic. Allright, Allright, Allright!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"According to the cast Jessica Chastain plays Matthew McConaughey daughter, so it seems he travels in time and will come back at some point when years had passed on earth.......I wonder when he comes back if he's going to be old or stay the same due to the worm hole, at least that's what I think "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh yea i forgot this was debuting before Godzilla. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't understand... but I want to see it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,It just ain't a Nolan film without Michael Caine.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Matthew McConaughey, Christopher Nolan, Michael Caine
plus the fact that they are touching upon a concept of wormholes which i myself am extremely fascinated by bumps this movie into the no. 1 spot of my list of movies to watch."
zSWdZVtXT7E,this generation's contact
zSWdZVtXT7E,Stellar...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Please don't give away the movie with trailers.  Please don't cave to people saying ""I dun git da trailer.  What's it all about?""  And please, please be good."
zSWdZVtXT7E, Christopher Nolan and  Matthew McConaughey... what else you need... this is the movie to watch this year!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,It will be a disappointing movie because there's no way a story this big can be told in just one movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,speechless!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I came here for Ann Hathaway
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Individual trumps the species IMHO.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Memento:Confusing Film but Great
Insomnia:Good
Batman Begins:Good save the Batman franchise
Prestige:Good film with a awesome ending 
Dark Knight:Excellent film in my opinion 
Inception:Great Film
Dark Knight Rises:Great but not as good as the previous.
So can Nolan pull off another good film? 
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nice V for Vendetta soundtrack
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks real interesting
zSWdZVtXT7E,"its gonna suck, their gonna space travel then not live to tell about but send through vital information to earth. roll credits were done here.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,If Muse's Exogenesis Symphony isn't somewhere in this movie then I just don't see the point of life.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans killing it again... 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks great, but might have the potential to be boring at some points in the film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So I he coming back,is he ,is he,is he,is he"
zSWdZVtXT7E,where is the Daft Punk?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Read the description.
Wormhole
Not technology"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hopefully this is far better than gravity because that was crap which is why the masses loved it. But from scifi it was made no sense. None of that crap would happen or are even near each other.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"*facepalm*
The stupidity of this comment is amazing."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"After all these craps that hollywood been making , we're gonna have new christopher nolan's movie"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Somewhere, out there, in a galaxy far, far away, Jodie Fosters waiting...."
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just watched the trailer.  If anyone ask me what this movie is about i'll say heck if I know.  I don't what I just saw or what this movie is about.  I didn't get it. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Transcendence gets low ratings with content dismissed... Nolan makes a movie with the boring content of humanity trying to escape their ecological irresponsibility = mad hype

hollywood is lame, proceed to the happy nihilism shuttle"
zSWdZVtXT7E,That's a big ship. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,woah.
zSWdZVtXT7E,pretty good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""I'm coming back"". He better not lie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan's 2001
zSWdZVtXT7E,After that spaceship enters into the wormhole obviously Nolan gonna screw our mind.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Im sick of people complaining that the trailer doesn't show the plot! Of corse it doesn't!! That would spoil it!! So many stupid movies reveal the whole plot and everything in the trailer...like ""Amazing'' spiderman 2 lol let it be a surprise! We'll be blown away :D "
zSWdZVtXT7E,My kind of movie. Been tired of the marvel /DC overdose lately
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music alone. Nolan will not fail
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Will not watch this.  Can't watch Anne Hatheway.  Awful, just awful.  Nolan, please stop putting her in your movies.  She just SUCKS!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,LOL this if funny because I just lost a Tech victory to America in Civilization V: Brave New World.
zSWdZVtXT7E,really Michael Caine is in a Christopher Nolan movie? that's a shocker. he is Michael Caine so if you have him might as well use him
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I have absolutely nothing to say, just like my comment."
zSWdZVtXT7E,NOLAN!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler! Christopher Nolan is going to do another open ending just like inception
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that the farm house from looper? 1:15
zSWdZVtXT7E,Will it be better than inception ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another phenomenal Nolan film. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,nice
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope Nolan doesn't disappoint me this time. I REALLY hated ""The Dark Knight Rises""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Let's add Jodie Foster to cast
zSWdZVtXT7E,The house from Signs.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks really good.
zSWdZVtXT7E,that songs from v for vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,Stunning space imagery. I'm so excited about the amount of space-related films in the works at the moment. It's something everyone wants to see!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The epic conclusion of Christopher Nolan's ""IN"" trilogy.

INSOMNIA
INCEPTION
INTERSTELLAR"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan and MacCaughney, a fantastic pair. Eagerly waiting for it!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Unlike most of you who have just jumped out of your skin at the mention of Nolan's name, I'm not easily sold.  I have not a doubt in my mind Mr. Nolan is going to knock this out of the park.  The man is a visionary with a mind for creating plots that cause you to question everything when he has given you all the answers.  With that stated I did not like this at all.  Dust storm and moody music... Ummm ok.  If this were the same trailer directed by Michael Bay (Transformers) the ""like"" bar would look like a fully smoked cigarette"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman narrates your job, then you know that stuff's about to get real.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Time is a flat circle "" "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Loved the earlier trailer but wasn't sold on this one. Mixed feelings about the film. But if anyone can surprise you it's Nolan!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why doesn't Nolan just make an Atlus Shrugged movie already.
zSWdZVtXT7E,mcconaughey and nolan together is the ultimate wet dream
zSWdZVtXT7E,and how old will she be he he gets back???
zSWdZVtXT7E,Michael Caine has been in five of Chris Nolans films this is his sixth. Nolan describes him as his good luck charm
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer brought me tears of joy :( This is my kind of movie. I can't wait to see it..I am sooo freaking pumped right now!! :))
zSWdZVtXT7E,i dont think hes coming back
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie looks like its gonna be awesome!
zSWdZVtXT7E,gonna be epic as hell
zSWdZVtXT7E,"uhhhhhh, sure"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I trust Nolan will deliver on another thought-provoking movie even though Im not buying the ""we were meant to live beyond Earth"" speel "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Even though I trust Nolan´s talent, this trailer made me worried that this movie is too melodramatic. I don´t wanna whatch another familiar drama in an extraordinary circumstances. I wanna whatch another Nolan masterpiece."
zSWdZVtXT7E,matthew mcconaughey+christopher Nolan=win.
zSWdZVtXT7E,CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Overrated by Batman idiots
zSWdZVtXT7E,Coooool!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,The movie will end with the beginning of the First Contact War against the Turians.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When you've got Christopher Nolan...you've got a friend, and that friend is you!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"YES!!  I'm Ready!  November! Why oh why November! :) Love that they have built my anticipation! And also inspired me for my writing, just off of the trailer! This looks good, kept simple, nicely measured acting, a film that's good on the eyes, great time at the theaters. :)
I'm going to go, and can't wait!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't get it. Where is Batman in this? Isn't this a Batman sequel?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Vietnam needs the world's support on the East Sea
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is going to be come a timeless classic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yay!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this working?
zSWdZVtXT7E,also we need this engineers make babies too
zSWdZVtXT7E,No comments?
zSWdZVtXT7E,fake.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks ok but the story sounds retarded
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks interesting and it will be out in time for my b-day :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Way to be original, Hollywood!
/sarcasm"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Are they playing V for Vendetta's climax music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,anyone know what the soundtrack is during this trailer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,That's not what Murphy's Law means at all!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Were not meant to save the earth, were meant to leave it"" Gave me chills."
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"hopfully this is one for the ages.

Nolan + mcconaughey + space travel ... god dam"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Of course it's a Christopher Nolan movie, Michael Caine is in it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well... I think it would have been best if we did not see the part WHERE THEY ALL DIE IN A BLACK HOLE
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nice a space movie. I'm sure ill like this
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The first couple of shots of him the car make no sense?!!

1st shot: ""Its an Indian surveillance drone!"" So Indians have drones? Ok, but the next shot/dialogue doesn't even connect to this!

2nd shot: ""Solar Cells power an entire farm!"" huh??! Can someone connect the dots Im missing here, other than that the trailer rocks."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Michael Caine in another Nolan film!
zSWdZVtXT7E,saw this amazing trailer tonight!! Right Before King of Monster (Godzilla)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks Boring........
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Keep digging, we need to find the plot. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"wicked, can't wait"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Far beyond our own lifespan ( hyper sleep ) = time travel
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the sequel is going to be starry night, and then the sequel to that'll be starry night rises. A trilogy about Matthew McConaughey with short hair and responsibilities for once! A Nolan gold prize! Just kidding. its based on a book. go read the book."
zSWdZVtXT7E,ID it's a black hole
zSWdZVtXT7E,this movie is going to be good until the next strar trek movie next year
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Funny with all these global warming apocalyptic movies, in which mankind wants to leave Earth in search of a new home... #1) We are accepting that we are ruining Earth, yet we don't do anything to fix it (and I mean, now, today, in the real Earth right here). We make the mess, then we want to leave to #2: make the exact same mess in a new world. Accept it. The human being will always be greedy, voracious, careless, selfish, no matter where it goes. We have it in our genes. The first thing that we'll do in another planet is look for gold, then pick the best place, make frontiers, and prohibit anybody else from getting to those resources. Humanity has no unity because we can't share, we want it all, and we'll always consider ourselves worthier and better that the others."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"chris nolan movies are way better than the trailer ( memento, the prestige, inception), so by this definition you should know that the movie is gonna be better than the trailer..........and the trailer is effing awesome."
zSWdZVtXT7E,you aint coming back....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like most of the movie is going to take place on Earth. The credits will probably roll when they go into the wormhole.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan with Hans Zimmer's music.. Shut up and take my money!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"*** Spoiler alert  ***

Matthew McConaughey & Anne Hathaway travels through black hole . They don't age when they are in black hole. by the time they return back to earth , his daughter and son will be adults ."
zSWdZVtXT7E,That Matthew McConaughey is so hot right now.
zSWdZVtXT7E,that music is epic !! hans zimmer always gives me chills 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks great!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For anyone wondering, the music is Evey Reborn from the V for Vendetta soundtrack. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is it, fellas. This is our generation's 2001."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This was gonna be a academy award winner from day 1 ! can't wait !
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""The world doesn't need more engineers""

*goes to find help in machine built by engineers*"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Michael Caine is the white version of Morgan Freeman..the subtle old man always providing advice, while explaining the plot and proving some sort of hope or explanation of what will happen....and of course he gets a dimple at the end"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan is special - Interstellar.
zSWdZVtXT7E,awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh my godddd this looks good. More space movies is what the world needs. Anything to do with space.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hm. More oriented towards the common man, but feels like a variation on Walter Tevis' novel ""The Steps of the Sun."" "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I really like the music in this trailer.... Anyone know what it is? Probably not, but worth a shot."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan and Caine, perfect match"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The song the trailer used was from V for Vendetta movie. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,-chris-
zSWdZVtXT7E,scratching my head......
zSWdZVtXT7E,lol another atrocity from Mr.Nolan...maybe worth watching because of Mr.McConnaghey .. but thats about it....Nolan hasnt made a good movie since Memento
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hell yeah, there should be more movies like this"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like another mind bending movie with a great plot twist that I look forward to.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"My bday Gift this Year , Inter""Stunner"" . xD"
zSWdZVtXT7E,THAT WORMHOLE LOOKED TERRIFIC!
zSWdZVtXT7E,oh this is gonna be good
zSWdZVtXT7E,It looks like a it about them sending astronauts into space on a long space mission.. How I know? Because that short shot of Jessica chastain(red head around 1:40) is his daughter all grown up. Give me my reward around November.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want this movie inside me. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Amazing.  This is the best kind of trailer. This spoils absolutely nothing and leaves the rest to your imagination. It makes you think about how the actual movie will be like and wonder whether or not your idea of the movie is actually how the movie flows.

Now, I really doubt it, but here's hoping it's better than Memento - Which I believe is Christopher Nolan's best movie. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,He does not come back...
zSWdZVtXT7E, Why hasn't Nolan won an Oscar yet?  
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Most likely what  is going to occur in this film is that once they are shipped off into space, near black whole, they will stay not to close so that they will get sucked in and die, but so that they can travel into the future (orbiting black whole). For all of you that might not know, the faster a person/object/thing however the fuck you want to put it, the faster one reaches closer to the speed of light, time begins, you can say to slow down and everything around you speeds up. All in all, lets say a year in orbit of black whole passes, they get out return to earth, it is now 200 years in earth years; everyone would most likely be dead but here is where they will begin their task of repopulating earth, happy ending blah blah, blah blah...Looking forward to it though, like how they are using science in this, sci-fi is my shit ;3"
zSWdZVtXT7E,GODZILLLAAAAAAAAA
zSWdZVtXT7E,Some day soon I hope man must evolve and create a means of Interstellar travel to survive ALA Gene Roddenberry vision is REAL!
zSWdZVtXT7E,early for this but watch this one for best pic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,yawns. looks crap.
zSWdZVtXT7E,After watching Godzilla everything seems underwhelming. I need to watch Godzilla again but this time in IMAX.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We must think not as individuals, but as a species"" Epic ! There better be a part 2 or I'm not going to watch the first part. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,H.O.L.Y M.O.L.L.Y
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So the plot of this movie is that the earth runs out of food, for whatever reason, and the only way to get food is by going into space?
Is there like a giant wall mart on mars or something?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like crap.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks dope
zSWdZVtXT7E,Reverse Jesus is ok to go !!! (Get it?)
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks like an m night shyamalan special 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Trying to find another planet. When he comes back, it will be million years past, traveling @ light speed stops time."
zSWdZVtXT7E,evey reborn
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want this movie to succeed...PLEASE let this get more views!
zSWdZVtXT7E,HNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHlooksamazing
zSWdZVtXT7E,That little girl looks like a mini Emma Stone!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity...lol just kidding.
zSWdZVtXT7E,DAT MUSIC!!!   DEM FEELS!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music? I'm sold.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope NOLAN will blow our mind with non-linear screen play....
zSWdZVtXT7E,What is Michael Caine doing in a Christopher Nolan movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,wait they can build a warpdrive but cant solve earth problems ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,He ain't coming back....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Goosebumps
zSWdZVtXT7E,4K?
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music used is: Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why do we not fund space if another dustbowl 20x the size of the one in the 20th century happened we would need this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Murph, I love you.... forever."" Couldn't help but laugh at that line. I can't wait for this, my expectations are ridiculously high. Let's hope Nolan can deliver yet again."
zSWdZVtXT7E,its going  to be another epic from Nolan..respect
zSWdZVtXT7E,One word. VaginaPunch
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks good but you can tell its a movie made by liberal Hollywood to bait us all into believing manmade global warming.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Another movie where they refuse to tell you the plot, but insist that you pay $15 to see."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I like the fact that the trailers are building and we're not seeing what I presume to be the best parts of the film. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,another oscar nomination.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sequel to Contact?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Got massive goosebumps when the Black Hole appeared 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sounds like 'When World's Collide'.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks like a trailer that doesn't event touch the third act (maybe even the second)
I am excited"
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks hella tight
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hands totally down !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Does anyone know the name of the song playing at the end?

This trailer made me physically dependant on that song"
zSWdZVtXT7E,the casting looks terrible
zSWdZVtXT7E,YES YES YES YES YES YES. I want to work for SpaceX. The world DOES need engineers.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A space film directed by Christopher Nolan, I'm sold. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A space film directed by Christopher Nolan, I'm sold. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oh hey, another earth is dying so lets just leave it movie... lul"
zSWdZVtXT7E,meh
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music is from V for Vendetta, if i'm not mistaken"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I will watch any movie Christopher Nolan directs. He is amazing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,i got goosebumps
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anything with Nolan on it is awesome....can't wait to see this
zSWdZVtXT7E,yep this is definitely going to suck
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks...B O R I N G G....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like crap. I could believe that half a tard was an aids patient but there's no way i'll buy him as an engineer / astronaut. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks good!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm not surprised for a reason.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this movie is a joke.......nobody is gona leave earth on a spaceship.....GOD is ALL .....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Apparently everything from this trailer happens in the first 15 minutes 
zSWdZVtXT7E,THIS LOOKS LIKE SERENITY MINUS ALL THE GOOD THINGS   
zSWdZVtXT7E,SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looking forward to it 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew McConaughey is in a movie this year. That means Leo can't get an Oscar.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""God is in the rain""

Like if you recognize this reference and why it's relevant to this trailer"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sort of reminds me of Contact.  Minus Jodie Foster.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Contact 2
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Cool, until I remembered Anne Hathaway is in it..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oh look, another teal and orange movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity meets Signs meets Armageddon meets 2012 meets Alfred. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anyone know the song?
zSWdZVtXT7E,GRAVITATIONAL LENSING THEORY!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh i hope to god this is as good as 2001: a space odssey was in its time really looking forward to a deep space adventure story!! OMFG why is november so far away!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yea... he's not coming back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,damn
zSWdZVtXT7E,gg
zSWdZVtXT7E,Reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another awesome movie is coming! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,Could be something but feels like it would be 1 hour 30 min crap and 20 min space (the interesting part)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Directed by Christopher Nolan? Yeeaah, no thanks. After that TDKR disaster, I just don't know."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hope his next project is Mr. Hughes and then continue with Sci-Fi or Psycho thrillers.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This Trailer looks good and the movie is gonna be awesome. trailer doesn't spoil anything, and i hope its hans zimmer score in the trailer"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like a good movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow this is incredibly amazing something that has never been done before. Holy crap there is a WWII movie in the side bar so original.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I am all for interstellar travel, but this movie looks weak."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love this trailer and how it doesn't quite let you know what is going on. Looks epic...where is that music from, I have heard it before!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I heard Nolan and Zimmer and Caine and Hathaway and I'm already excited and marking the date in my calendar. Nolan never disappoints, looking forward to this!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that 'V for Vendetta' music playing? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm gonna see this movie, but honestly this trailer has nothing to be excited about other than the fact that Nolan's name is on it. I mean seriously, what did you see or hear that's got you pumped? I'm a Nolan fan boy, but this trailer womps... Gravity had one heck of a trailer. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Holy CRAP this looks amazing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,skeet
zSWdZVtXT7E,finally a decent trrailerrrr
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Meh. So they can make a ship capable of... what is that, wormhole travel? But they can't put a farm up on Europa or Enceladus or Titan or Ganymede, or ship ice and metal from asteroids into orbit to build farms there, or figure out how to just make food from raw amino acids like we're accomplishing right now?

I mean I guess there could be enough war to offset the fact that we're capable of generating freaking wormholes, but why? Pointless dickery? Just more apocalyptic melodrama for the overwhelming amount of misanthropes that have been attracted to our genre."
zSWdZVtXT7E,they had me at Matthew Mcconaughey 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The world doesn't need any more engineers...because you ran out of food?

What the hell kind of stupid tortured logic is that?  If that's what they're leading off their trailer with, it does not bode well for the rest of the film..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looking good!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not cool. Warner Bro's another flop.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Science fiction and even popular culture, when on the topic of space, seems preoccupied with life on other planets and/or getting to the stars. I have a theory; as we continue to explore and get more acquainted with our solar system, the focus of science fiction and popular culture will begin to shift from the stars and turn to the wonders of our solar system and how man can travel within the system. I call it growing up and I figure we should start seeing this shift 20 years from now."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yay another ""End of the World"" Movie. These high up people just love the paranoia it creates lool"
zSWdZVtXT7E,world always needs more true engineers...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Meh.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks original and epic!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What about the near-earth orbit? The moon? Mars? You've GOT to master the tech needed to live in these places before venturing far, right?

If you are a 1400's European, would you set sail for the Atlantic Ocean to look for new land with TINY BOATS? Would you head straight to the vast ocean without outlining the land closest to you first?!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dat V for Vendetta soundtrack!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't see a devoted Father leaving his family behind unless he's going out there to find a way to save Earth. Caine's character tells him to go out there and ""save them."" So maybe their mission has some kind of preservation of Earth in mind. However the trailer seems like Earth has no chance and McCaunahey and crew are going out there for good (to be the last humans to exist). If so.... no way could I  leave my Daughter behind like that. No matter what. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sucked into a black hole 😳
zSWdZVtXT7E,Civilization:Beyond Earth The Movie.......
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The trailer ends at the perfect moment, with our cast on the edge of the unknown, and us on the edge of our seats.  #Interstellar   "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Great! Another save humanity from itself movie. OK, fine.
Now, who's original story did somebody steal to write the screenplay for this movie?
By original story, I don't mean a script, I mean an actual published novel, novella, or even a simple short story."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't understand what the Indian surveillance drone is a point in the movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks awesome!!! PS this is the song from V for Vendetta. AWESOME
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I love you, forever? ....pass"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan? alrite I'll watch it.. he hasn't let me down yet.    ...yet.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks good
zSWdZVtXT7E,I was blown away. I look forward to the release in theaters this November. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Almost a million views and no comment? WTF!
The movie looks fantastic."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I bet he doesnt come back
zSWdZVtXT7E,very interesting
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like that a country guy could save us somehow and that he has children that's why he says ""I got kids professor"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,HYPE CONFIRMED
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where is Jodie Foster?
zSWdZVtXT7E,THANK GOD OHM YM YMMYMY AOERGN OEIUGERAMG
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yes he will come back and his kids will be in their 90's.  :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"nolan hype + blare horn in every background soundtrack + flashy, plotless cinematography = overrated"
zSWdZVtXT7E,By the looks of that ship design it seems pretty obvious that Nolan has been playing too much KSP.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Building a rocket to leave Earth from destruction? SIMPSONS DID IT!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anybody noticed this fact? They're pretty...the same. WHY? Explain. V For Vendetta   Evey Reborn Scene
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So...how 'bout that track from ""V for Vendetta""? Pretty great, huh?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait! (This better not suck like Transcendence)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I've heard this music before, anyone know what it's off?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Love the use of Evey Reborn from V For Vendetta which is an amazing film and this looks like it will also be amazing :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Why this trailer is using V for Vendetta OST? I hope this movie have their own soundtrack.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was that Ice Cube?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan has carte blanche with me. As soon as his name was revealed that's it. I don't nee to know anything else.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like Hans Zimmer has composed another masterpiece!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer doesn't say much, it's about the first 30 minutes explaining why the earth is dying and why a small group must leave to find a solution, we still don't have a single clue what the real story is, which begins after they use that wormhole. They'll keep that part a mystery until opening day, anyway I hope, too many trailers nowadays give too much information about their movie.  Still a good trailer, can't wait for November 7 :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,hmmm idk what exactly this movie is about....but so far i like it
zSWdZVtXT7E,dis gon be gud
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks great, just too many white people."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I need this in my eyes right away
zSWdZVtXT7E,V For Vendetta - God is in the Rain
zSWdZVtXT7E,too much information trailer seems to give away
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks beautiful!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm sold already. Cant wait tile November
zSWdZVtXT7E,"After watching this trailer, it moved."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its a Gravity 2
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is this a prequel to Mass Effect movies? cuz if that sphere is a mass effect relée IM IN. If Chris Nolan's in, im definitely IN!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,i got very emotional...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yeah! Awesome!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Rust is finally going to Carcosa.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Confirming 127 people wouldn't know a good movie even if it came up and bit them in the ass, litteraly"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What the... they used the ""Evey Reborn"" music from V for Vendetta."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I do not think that Nolan is the cinematic messiah many people think he is, so I am reserving judgment. 

This trailer? Meh........A lot of pious speechifying and platitudes going on here.

We'll see. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,what is this song in the background?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Once again, 80% of plot won't be reveal until it's at the theaters, good marketing as always!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"FINALLY!!! it looks just as good as i thought it would! also, the music in this trailer was used in V for Vendetta."
zSWdZVtXT7E,My God what a beautiful trailer...
zSWdZVtXT7E,DAT V for Vendetta sountrack....
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was thinking if the wormhole takes Cooper (Matthew) to ""another earth"". The woman at 1:41 seems to me like it is her daughter, and a few seconds later we have his daughter on screen. And the fact that he says that he is coming back made me think if that isn't the real deal. It would look like an spacial Inception.... This is kinda crazy but ok. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,FINALMENTE!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Black holes, Space - Yeah, I'm ready for this! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait for this film! The scene when he goes through the wormhole is wow!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta music niiice
zSWdZVtXT7E,"am i the only one that found the characters and plotline (at least up until whatever happens in space) are extremely generic? i think i've seen this movie 100 times. 

don't get me wrong, it's highly polished and very gorgeous, but we better be seeing more than just cosmetic changes to the same old story."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I want the music for this trailer now. LOOKs and sounds Awsome
zSWdZVtXT7E,meh 2/5
zSWdZVtXT7E,"HINT: ""I'm coming back"". So meaning it could be time travel to the past to fix the issue on earth. But scientific way of coming back to the past. Not some mumbo jumbo time travel machine"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not thrilled that its Matthew Mcconaughey but this still looks amazing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,OMFG !!!!!!!!! THIS AND XMEN are the movie's to watch this year.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm beginning to think Christopher Nolan physically owns Michael Caine.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks goo0o0o0o0o0od~
zSWdZVtXT7E,sooo many good movies coming out!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,There ain't no coming back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not gfoing to judge it till it comes out I just want it to be really good because when gravity is a sci fi Oscar winner you know there is a problem. I am hoping this is finally the Oscar winner hat he has deserved since inception which should have won.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mass Effect prequel! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,So it's about the desperate measures humans have to go through when overpopulation reaches it's peak?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I've watched this 30 times already, is that wrong?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks like only the first 20 minutes of the movie! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"for anyone wondering im pretty sure the song is a version of Evey Reborn by Dario Marianelli from V for Vendetta
kinda prefer this version though"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alright-alright.
zSWdZVtXT7E,the new 2001
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Someone knows where I can get the song of the end of the trailer?
(Sorry i´m not good writing in english)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Alright alright.......
zSWdZVtXT7E,So what's the story?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gotta love that V for Vendetta music.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music in the trailer is from V for Vendetta. That's been bugging me for the past hour.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The trailer gave away most of it I would say
zSWdZVtXT7E,dat wormhole 
zSWdZVtXT7E,the world is starving and he's driving his truck through cornfields?
zSWdZVtXT7E,A real sci-fi movie? But it'll be dumbed-down for today's audiences right? (I hope not)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""the world doesn't need more engineers""... as an unemployed engineer, yes"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks pretty boring to be honest. Another white guy in charge of Single-handedly saving humanity. Haven't seen this a zillion times,.

Mass Effect > This."
zSWdZVtXT7E,BANE??
zSWdZVtXT7E,"is this movie going to be a big ""WE SHOULD GO TO SPACE NOT DESPITE OUR PROBLEMS BUT BECAUSE OF THEM!!!!!!!""? if so im throwing money at my screen"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"YES please, i'll have some of that!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,omg chris nolan done the impossible .............it's awesome.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This reminds of the stellar atmosphere paper that changed our understanding of heavenly bodies. Now, Nolans onboard! Wheey"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well, I have to say I'm actually excited now."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"awesome, just awesome Nolan the best"
zSWdZVtXT7E,amazing!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Kind of reminds my space cowboys except instead of a asteroid its America being hungry...Just me?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Was really looking forward to this movie, but this trailer really disappointed me. I guess I was expecting something along the lines of Transcendence. I know the latter wasn't great, but it had all the style and far-out plot of I was expecting. Interstellar doesn't really feel too special. Hopefully, Nolan is saving the best and only showed the exposition of the movie and the bulk of it actually takes place in Space (with some sort of cool antagonist.) "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Murphy's Law means anything that can happen, will happen ... alright, alright, alright"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ok, now I understand what it's all about.  I can dig it. :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"are they using a blackhole to slingshot the craft into Faster then light speeds?
1:54"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I see a wormhole there.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gods in the rain...... (Remember that scene in V? It's the same song used in the trailer) 
zSWdZVtXT7E,How could he be coming back? You can't go that far away and make it back in time.  
zSWdZVtXT7E,chris nolan? im in
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music name: ""Evey Reborn"" (from the brilliant scifi V for Vendetta -- Washowski Brothers)."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow. Just.................wow. Definitely going to see this. Time for some serious sci-fi.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Honestly, this trailer wasn't that good. But the movie may be good. So, good for them."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Thanks you Christopher Nolan for making amazing films.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The best trailer Ive seen for a movie so far this year
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where are da aliens?
zSWdZVtXT7E,THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO TAKE THE MOVIE GRAVITY TO THE NEXT LEVEL!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"sci-fi is what film was made for, can't wait"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Curious to see if this will impress me more than Inception.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks amazing!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait for this movie knowing as well Anne Hathaway is in it huge crush lol well they show her in the 1:52 mark but like the plot very interesting Oh btw like the GODZILLA roar at the end like if it went with this movie lol.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Well....... That Looks actually good to me!
zSWdZVtXT7E,McConaughey seems to be awesome in this film; no surprises there! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hate to be that guy but I'm pretty sure he's not coming back. Motherwise looks like a phenomenal movie
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Read the old script on this a while back, if this ends anything like the script I read, it will top Inception in most messed up ending. Brace for feels."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Soundtrack sounds sick!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks depressing as hell.
zSWdZVtXT7E,AWESOME
zSWdZVtXT7E,i hope he doesnt forget his probes :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,And i am sure this trailer music is from V for Vendetta. Such a powerful track
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hot damn
zSWdZVtXT7E,IN A GOOD WAY!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The planet is melting but as long as our Ice Cream doesn't, fine.
Some of us thank god/s when we find our lost House Key but forget that 8 million kids under five years of age die every single year from horrific diseases and they won't be thanking God/Allah/Zeus or Mickey Mouse.
This is a film but the warnings are there. Soon there will be no other species left due to our greed, population growth and ignorance. We will hunt Animals, eat them and destroy their habitat. Then all that will remain is tens of Billons of people, all wanting more and what each other has and Wars will follow.
The writing is one the wall, we are fucked. And yet we could be so much more.
Science, education, investigation, compassion, empathy and reason could still win the day?
Wake up. We need to change before we all loose."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like as long as Nolan keeps making films, Michael Caine can be sure of work."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like as long as Nolan keeps making films, Michael Caine can be sure of work."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So why can't Morgan Freeman get Roundevous with Rama made?
It's one of my favourite scifi books and would be an amazing film."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music sounds familiar. Where did I hear that before...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow looks like they made some sort of Alcubierre bubble to travel FTL
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Jessica Chastain at 1:41 !! Looks like she'll play his daughter grown up... Can't wait for this shit, so many amazing actors."
zSWdZVtXT7E,they better give us a good look of what happens in space in the movie or some aliens otherwise it wont live up to its hype 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks amazing. This kinda reminds of 2001: A Space Odyssey! To Everyone complaining about not understanding the plot, why is that a bad thing? This is a trailer done right, it doesn't give the whole movie away!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Let's send an idiot to find another planet to destroy.......AWFUL
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:33 oops...water in space ?!? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"does anybody know if it's gonna show the actual mission...the discoverings and stuff? or is that kind of plot...they reach a planet,mission succsefull movie over?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Nolan, in my opinion, has yet to produce a bad film. I am super excited for this one!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another Nolan masterpiece
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dear sweet baby jesus and the orphans I am excited about this!   
zSWdZVtXT7E,"That's how you create a trailer, 2 mins of showing something but having no idea what is really happening, backed by nolan and mcconaughey you know its going to be good"
zSWdZVtXT7E,badass!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was nearly brought to tears watching this trailer. I have high hopes for this movie, that perhaps it could be the piece of artwork that reinvigorates humanity to reach for the stars."
zSWdZVtXT7E,@Leila Mansour Let's see this 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Very excited to see this film!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Can we all just take a moment to praise how beautifully shot this seems to be? Nothing against Pfister, but I think Nolan stepped up with his choice of Hoyte Van Hoytema."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"YES YES YES!!! Also, can't actually believe the choice of music. It's from my favorite moment from my favorite movie. It's from the 'god is in the rain' scene from V For Vendetta :)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,doesnt feel like Nolan until Michael Cain shows up
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks interesting...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Same song from V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't breathe. 
Where do I get a time machine so I can get to November right now?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like its going to be another great film by Christopher Nolan!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Space, parallel universes, Matthew McConaughey, MY BODY IS READY."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I still wonder why 106 dislikes for this trailer ! YouTube bug !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Almost looks like a tie-in to Civ 5 Beyond Earth.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music is beautiful but I'm getting a bit of an armageddon feeling from this
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Anyone ever read Genesis (not the bible). It has a lot of similar elements as this except it also contains a huge element of religion in it. I can already tell this movie will be great, Chris never fails us."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"maybe matt mcconaughey's just in a dream inside of a dream
and this is an inception sequel"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"V for Vendetta ""evey reborn"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The song is so apropos, Evey Reborn--it fits!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Couldn't get a single thing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,He finds space Carcosa 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I finally know what the heck this movie is about,  and I'm pumped! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Prometheus.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I have to see this!!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where the music in the trailer from?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I this the V for Vendetta score I'm hearing? If so, nicely chosen."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Sounds like Zimmer took some inspiration from Edvard Grieg's Aese's Death...


Edvard Grieg - Peer Gynt - Suite No. 1, Op. 46 - II. Aase's Death"
zSWdZVtXT7E,im going to have hard time watching this and not thinking that is the creepy baby from twilight
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Evey reborn....from V for Vendetta, good soundtrack"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I just saw this movie yesterday (came back through a wormhole) It's great!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This movie is NOT about environmentalism, not at its core. 
It's essentially about the ""Space Manifest Destiny."" 
I believe this movie focuses on the battle between science and conservatism, a.k.a ""Why do we do we need to spend so much on science when we can't fix our own problems today?""
Considering the continual budget cuts for NASA (despite them spending less than 1/50th of the spending on military resources), it's quite the contemporary piece"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I could not recognize Hans Zimmer's music at all, i'm really excited for this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Words have failed me (this doesn't happen often).  I am beyond excited to see a proper Sci-Fi movie again.  I say proper because this appears to be born from the same dreams and ideas that lead so many to look into the sky and out across the universe and say, ""Why can't we travel to there?""  I cannot wait to see this movie. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Not that I'm saying the trailer looks uninteresting, it certainly doesn't. I just hope the movie turns out to be totally different and unexpected, just like when we actually got to watch 'Inception'."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm coming back. He is not going to make it, is he? :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,A warp bubble!
zSWdZVtXT7E,It looks like alfred has a new job now.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wept.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Not the greatest trailer, that's for sure. Especially after the awe inspiring first teaser, but it gets the story across. I'm still interested and really can't wait for this, hopefully amazing, film to come out!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yes Yes Yes Yes!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"goddamn, i'm excited about this movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where is the score from? This is from another movie. Can't put my finger on it though 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"1:54 It looks like a non-infinite universe? does anyone know what it could be?!

 ·"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Black hole 1:54
zSWdZVtXT7E,Civilization 6 looks incredibly! These graphic are life like
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow that was impressive
zSWdZVtXT7E,Armageddon?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was interested after watching the teaser, but now the film just looks boring and bland. I bet half of it will take place on that farm, the rest looks like they will just be aimlessly flying through space and black holes."
zSWdZVtXT7E,The song in the trailer is Evey Reborn by Dario Marianelli for anyone interested :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Matthew Mconaughey has come a long way. To think he used to be a mindless sex icon. Now he is a genuine bonified AAA actor.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love Nolan and can't wait to see this movie I just hope he makes a much better movie than at least in my mind the terrible movie dark knight rises.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer has the dumbest line of dialogue from any Nolan movie ""The world doesn't need engineers."" Really? What about agricultural engineers? Then they cut to a spaceship that was apparently built without engineers. Just all kinds of stupid in this trailer. It has made me hate the film without having seen it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"To everyone that believes we aren't meant to live in space:
Of course humanity isn't meant to live in space, the billions of years of evolution into our species happened all on this planet. However, through research, we've discovered other habitable planets throughout our own galaxy. Our galaxy is upon billions of other galaxies with potentially habitable planets. Science shows that Earth will eventually run out of the resources we have come to depend on to sustain life. So what do you do? Sit here and do nothing, telling yourself that we're meant to die out in a few thousand years or less? Or do you grasp your intelligence and realize that we are in control of our future?﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This was the best movie i have ever seen, I hope that they make a trailer for it"
zSWdZVtXT7E,OMG THAT'S RUST FROM TRUE DETECTIVE YES! CAPS ARE NECESSARY!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Believe in Nolan 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Cool! Heres hoping they don't spend too much time on the set up and rush the ending.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I've watched this trailer about 10 times already.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The dialogue was quite purely written tbh
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think Jessica Chastain plays the older version of Matthew's daughter if the imdb script is anything to go by.﻿
zSWdZVtXT7E,v for vandetta music??
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think matthew mcconaughey is a brilliant actor. Its a shame hes such a self centered prick in real life 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music is Evey Reborn from V for Vendetta, if anyone's interested..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Music from V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,so excited.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For those who want to know, the music is from V for Vendetta"
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan we trust!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't wait for November! Can't, can't, can't!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Perfect trailer really

Gives the basic plot while not spoiling the film"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Your not supposed to understand it from trailor!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Rust we Trust.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope they explain why we couldnt genetically engineer food like we kinda already do.
zSWdZVtXT7E,omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it."" Michael Caine as super-wise-old-dude
DEAD"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't ever remember a film revolving around interstellar travel that's at least been taken seriously... Needless to say I have monumental expectations for this film.
zSWdZVtXT7E,this is what a trailer should be. develops interest in the movie without giving up most of the plot or any spoilers
zSWdZVtXT7E,song: V For Vendetta Soundtrack - 08 - Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli
zSWdZVtXT7E,"They ripped the song from V for Vendetta
V For Vendetta Soundtrack - 08 - Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli"
zSWdZVtXT7E,97 people are engineers.
zSWdZVtXT7E,V FOR VENDETTA MUSIC IS ALWAYS APPROPRIATE
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Something I saw: I suspect that Jessica Chastain is his daughter, grown up.Due to the dynamics of the proposed interstellar travel, wormholes and such.. it looks like the mission takes at least 20+ Earth years. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't remember the last time I was this excited to see a film...
zSWdZVtXT7E,wooow nolan!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was that John Lithgow I saw there too?...this movie looks awesome
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I really can't wait for this movie but I feel like Anne Hathaway will ruin it, she's so bad and annoying.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Am I the only one realizing that the song played through the entire trailer is from V for Vendetta?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow. Oh please let this be good. My most anticipated film the year.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I was sold the moment I found out Christopher Nolan was making this movie, but watching this trailer and seeing Matthew Mcconaughey and his horrible lack of range (same annoying southern accent in every movie) made me want to turn the trailer off which is a bummer because I was looking forward to it. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,DAMN!
zSWdZVtXT7E,So not coming back...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The thing that got me is the Murphy's law angle. If it can happen, it will happen. If we can destroy the Earth, we will destroy the Earth. If we can survive, we will survive. If we can be destroyed, we will be destroyed.
I've no idea how this movie will play out."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Figured it out. The song is Evey Reborn by Dario Marinelli for V for Vendetta. Eve Reborn - V for Vendetta Soundtrack I think most ppl will recognize it around the 1:30 mark. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Global warming my ass, what is coming is global freezing."
zSWdZVtXT7E,any one say black hole?
zSWdZVtXT7E,finally... a good sci-fi film...
zSWdZVtXT7E,Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die there.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dork knight rises was aweful. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anything released by Legendary Pictures is a must watch.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"this looks like a 4 hour movie, i am not complaining though"
zSWdZVtXT7E,finally an Interstellar trailer.  Got high hopes for you Christopher Nolan
zSWdZVtXT7E,Holy. Effing. Shitballs.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I really don't understand the plot of this movie. we can't grow food on land so we leave the planet?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like a big step up from the turd that was The Dark Knight Rises! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Matthew McConaughey sure did flip the script on his career, everything he's part of is a hard hitter these days. Respect."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan's 2001: A Space Odyssey?
zSWdZVtXT7E,The song in this trailer is CHILLING.  I hope someone puts that out well before November
zSWdZVtXT7E,omg...wow...looks great!
zSWdZVtXT7E,The warp drive in this movie looks like the Alcubierre Warp Drive that NASA is currently building a prototype of.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I like the fact it does not give away the story or plot. Would be nice going into this moving and not knowing what to expect, can't wait."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I love the way Nolan keeps the good bits secret
zSWdZVtXT7E,This is gonna be cool...
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I had been anticipating this trailer for such a long time, and it was a partial reason why I went to see Godzilla last night, so I could see the new trailer on the big screen. As soon as McConaughey popped up, I yelled ""shhhh"" in the buzzing theater and everything went quiet. I stopped eating my popcorn, and a beautiful two minutes ensued... This movie is going to be the best of 2014, I can feel it. It has so much going for it. Nolan's craft and perfection with his movies is like no one else's; his unique style will be breathtaking. (He's already warned theaters that the sound design and output will be like nothing else before.) I can Interstellar winning 10 Oscars next February including a second consecutive Best Actor for MM. I will be in Boston at the time of this release and I hope to attend a big midnight premiere! I won't be sleeping much come October! The excitement is here!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yay! Grown folks science fiction! After all the superheroes and monsters and aliens it's good to see science fiction about science!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks good, the only thing I am concerned about is that Nolan will devote too much time focusing on the emotional aspect of the characters at the cost of the fun scientific/spacey stuff.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well, after seeing this trailer I am officially sold! No need to see any more footage in my opinion. Hope they don't go silly with more expansive trailers before release. This was just right."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well, after seeing this trailer I am officially sold! No need to see any more footage in my opinion. Hope they don't go silly with more expansive trailers before release. This was just right."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it bad I thought about Interstellar 5555 first?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Did they end up poisoning all the corn in this movie through like genetic engineering? It sorta seems like it since they say they have now food but theres corn everywhere. Plus theres a scene where a bunch a scientist are burning down a corn field.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that one of the scores from V for Vendetta?? I was trying to put my finger on it
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can Christopher Nolan be the Stanley Kubrick of our time ?
zSWdZVtXT7E,The music is the escape music from shawshank redemption slightly altered.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Still isn't enough in this trailer shown or teased to psych me up about it. I need more. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,it's the theme music from V for Vendetta! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,So that's what Alfred do when bruce wayne is gone
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks awesome!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Where is The Hobbit Battle of the Five Armies trailer??!?! It will come out in Dec, this in Nov and we have a trailer.... So i guess next month?????"
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Sequel is gonna be called Interstellar Rises
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yay! Matthew! :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,ALFREDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Don't forget your Totem when you go into the wormhole within the wormhole within the wormhole, McConaughey, or else you might not make it back."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Another Nolan sausage fest.
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks awesome movie!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Oh look, Matthew McConaughey plays a guy from Texas. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks wack.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Breathless.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Travel to another star system in order to grow corn?  Sounds legit.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Worth waiting for !
zSWdZVtXT7E,Such a beautiful trailer. Mr. Nolan....thrill me.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope it will allow me to fill up my collection of cool movies. I trust on you, Chris!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,My intrigue level is over 9000!
zSWdZVtXT7E,CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!!! That's my BOY!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Humans weren't meant to die here... well we weren't *meant* to do anything: we evolved by natural selection, there wasn't foresight about our future!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is this better than Twilight?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"If that dude ends up meeting his dead daddy on Pensacola beach, I'm demanding my money back."
zSWdZVtXT7E,On Wiki it says Matt Damon is in Interstellar plus this trailer showed mostly about life on earth and his family therefore the film is keeping the time travel and plot in the movie under wraps
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan + Matthew Mcconaughey + Sci-Fi?

This movie is gonna blow my pants off, holy shit. Can't wait. Oscar nomination, no doubt."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can someone please tell me the name of that EPICC song that is played in the background
zSWdZVtXT7E,replay button = raped 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer made me shed a manly tear.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is the Scorsese of Sci-Fi/Thriller/Action movies.  I hope this movie finally gets him that Best Director Nod. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,feel the hype
zSWdZVtXT7E,the title of the music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Will this movie take place at all in other planets? Will there be cgi like in avatar or is it more a something to think about movie?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Song is Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The first human-built FTL drive! Now whether that is actually going to happen or not is a totally different story. Check out a legion of other sweet fictional space rides by Google-ing, Bing-ing or Yahoo-ing this: RTxEvent
uid=409676&page=2"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I honestly teared up three times watching this, and I'm sitting in my college library with my friend next to me doing her Java homework. This will be Nolan's most emotional film yet."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I bet that all the footage in this trailer is only from the first 30 minutes of the movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"HELLLLL YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! This looks so exciting!!  However, my only fear is Nolan will spend too much time providing exposition on the whole food thing and less time on rad space stuff...like black holes...and cryosleep...and..robots...hah"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hyperdrive looks awesome!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Should just use hydroponics if its simply a food issue.
 
Saying that I have liked everything Nolan has made."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Ah, so this is what Alfred ended up doing."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks fantastic, what a talent Matthew McConaughey is.   Seriously he has to be one of the worst actors of all time."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"THIS
IS
GONNA
BE
EPIC
!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  and more Yes'.

This will hopefully be the movie to wake enough people up that our kind needs to go beyond our own solar system!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Omg this looks amazing I had chills , thank u god for chrisTopher Nolan "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I am beyond excited to see Christopher Nolan's next epic. This is looking to be another masterpiece by Nolan.
zSWdZVtXT7E,there is a lot to digest in that trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks alittle to sci-fi for me but ill still go watvh it becuz chris nolan 
zSWdZVtXT7E,anything that can happen will happen? so being in bed with emma watson is a matter of time? .. yuss..
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan HAS TO DIRECT one more Superhero movie this look promising especially with Hans Zimmer Score. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Meh. Guy goes into space, and............?

Never a good sign when you can't tell what the plot is from the trailer. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"this is either going to be really good, or really bad."
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks better than I thought it would. :O
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait.
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack was made by Gods. I wuv it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,So... Grapes of Wrath... in Space?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Its clear Jessica chastain and Casey affleck are his kids. He will return to earth he didn't age yet some many years have past on earth. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"There are a lot of iconic directors, but I feel many get too much credit for films that have fantastic stories and screenplay. Chris Nolan is one of the few who also writes most of his films. I very much respect those kind of directors."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Interstellar travel through Wormholes ! Amazing Nolan....Looks promising.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So this is like Noah's Ark
zSWdZVtXT7E,@Dalt Wisney Maybe we ARE the aliens D:
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Perfect use, for the trailer, of the V for Vendetta soundtrack. Took me a bit to recall the music. Great looking movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,looks so boring lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,so there going to leave earth to save it how........?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This makes me want to hear Carl Sagan...
zSWdZVtXT7E,O_O
zSWdZVtXT7E,THAT WILL BE GREAT!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"As amazing as this trailer looks, I miss Wally Pfister's cinematography. It doesn't feel like a Nolan film without that epic look Pfister's lens brought to his films"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hope it is not like the other crappy movies made by Chris Nolan. The batman movies and Inception particularly sucked big time. This looks better
zSWdZVtXT7E,OOOOOHHHH MYYYY GOOOOOOD
zSWdZVtXT7E,*I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite trailer on the Citadel.*
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks pretty great :D! Matthew McConaughey is pretty awesome too :P.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie...will be the movie that pierces the heavens ;o
zSWdZVtXT7E,i love nolan movies but im just getting a bad vibe from this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,What happens!?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I think Christopher Nolan really outdone himself with this! The teaser didn't really make an inpact on me. This one did! Must watch!
zSWdZVtXT7E,So THIS is what Rust Cohle got up to after TD...aaah
zSWdZVtXT7E," 00:43 Who wears sunglasses while playing baseball? This movie's gonna suck, Christopher Nolan is an overrated hack! ;)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The trailer seems to mislead itself between the copy and the dialog. ""We"" have to leave it? Whatever it's a smarter Armageddon"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan Always knows hot to deliver!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Fucking Chills Man.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,well that explained nothing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This shit is going to be awesome!!!
(talking about the movie obvsly :P )"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The realities of interstellar travel means this will induce some sort of time travel element. Which is where this film will buy it's thrills, it's open to infinite endings."
zSWdZVtXT7E,LOOKS EPIC !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"About time this trailer came out! Looks good though. I sense there will be some tear jerking moments as well. With that I'm pretty sure Nolan's formula will stand on good ground with this flick. ﻿

#interstellar﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Seven thousand 400 and 20second viewer. I called it first YAY
zSWdZVtXT7E,"My worry is that they are going to make it so unbelievable by leaving out special relativity. (for example, leaving earth for a year at some fast speed and coming back with only a year having gone by).  Other than that, I am excited for a space movie "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wait, I saw this movie in 1998. It was called Lost In Space. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Spoiler (Not really): He travels through space and time, finds a planet, comes back to Earth only to find everyone he knows has died long ago of old age - including his kids. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,2001 anyone?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I cannot wait to see this. CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't know if it's where the song originates, but it's from V for Vendetta."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Special Thanks to Scott Manly and Squad.
zSWdZVtXT7E,the soundtrack is evey reborn from V from Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,That's what you call a fucking movie trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Decent although running out of food seems very unlikely given all that farmland in the backgrounds.. just saying.  Not hating on the film or anything just simply not overlooking possible flaws in the back story.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Psyched for Interstellar. Hope it's one of your best Chris. :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,All right all right all right
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Great.  More environmentalist claptrap.  If they could find a way to travel across the universe, why couldn't they find a way to sustain life on earth?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,SHIT THE FUCK UP EVEYBODY! IT'S ALREADY EPIC!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER TRAILER FOR SO LONG
zSWdZVtXT7E,You know what's going to happen right? Mathews character is going to end up going through the wormhole and end up talking to his dad on a beach at the end.
zSWdZVtXT7E,OMG Evey Reborn from V For Vendetta is the music for the trailer and used so effectively!
zSWdZVtXT7E,chilling.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Read the script awhile back very excited to see it on the big screen. Especially with all the unimaginable things going on. The nolan bros are very good at what they do
zSWdZVtXT7E,Score from V for vendetta :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that not the V for Vendetta Soundtrack ''Evey Reborn''? Hope Dario Marianelli gets his credit.
zSWdZVtXT7E,EPICC!...Its like what movies has Nolan made that was bad? and if you think the TheDarkKnight Rises was bad then that just means Nolan is genius because compared to other movies TDKR is incredible. This guy I tell you is one hell of a story teller. Truly great. Every movie he puts out trips the mind.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Milking Gravity
zSWdZVtXT7E,"music can be only described  with the word's ""O KURWA"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For those asking, the song used in the trailer is ""Evey Reborn"" by Dario Marianelli. The song is from the V for Vendetta score."
zSWdZVtXT7E,It will be exciting to watch Anne Hathaway here. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Listening to the background all I can think of is V for Vendetta >.>
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For some reason 'Armageddon' came into my head watching this trailer

Really excited for this movie! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So uhhh, Armageddon part 2?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"It would suck if they space-time warped just to the other side of the moon. ""Oh yeah, forgot to mention, we had budget cuts."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"We must confront the reality of interstellar travel.  

Yep."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks pretty great.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"As you know, I make awesome trailers ;)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is that Bane doing the narration!?
zSWdZVtXT7E,is he Matthew Mcconaughey ? I am assuming
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta soundtrack
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So, basically, humanity is doomed unless we find a way to migrate to other worlds? That's encouraging..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan + Matthew Mcconaughey comeback + Jessica Chastain =
ABSOLUTE PERFECTION"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh man... My body is NOT ready for this much excitement. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Song is called ""Eve Reborn_ from V for Vendetta. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Seems fairly pedestrian from what's shown there - meh.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"cant wait!, brb going to play kerbal space program LOL"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Rust all high flying space ships n Shit:-)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Hm, I liked the teaser more"
zSWdZVtXT7E,YES
zSWdZVtXT7E,HOLY FUCKING SHIT I WANT TO WATCH IT!
zSWdZVtXT7E,IT'S THE EVE GATE!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dat wormhole though.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow! This trailer has sold me. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Once again Christopher Nolan does not disappoint. Not only does this movie look great, but it looks like it's going to have a great complex story and great acting. I can't wait to see it this holiday. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,one word... EPIC 
zSWdZVtXT7E,omg omg omg omg omg omg
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I've written a story since 2010 and recorded it in 2012 on the internet which seems far too close to that script. How can that be? I always wanted to make a movie of it, but after that film people will call me a thief for the plot? It's disarming..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"""Evey Reborn"" by Dario Marianelli from movie ""V for Vendetta""

zSWdZVtXT7E,"""The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars"" - Sagan"
zSWdZVtXT7E,How come this trailer uses Evey Reborn from V for Vendetta as the music?
zSWdZVtXT7E,fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck this is gonna be good
zSWdZVtXT7E,Tau zero anyone? Still love Nolan tho
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow! stunning!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'll go see this.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music: http://youtu.be/BjgTFd6XAg8
Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Why does MewMay always look so orange these days?  Self tanning lotion?  Yeah I just called Matthew McConaughey MewMay, and I'm going to persist.  That way I won't have to look up the spelling of his last name in Google."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For anyone who cares, the name of the song in the trailer is in the V for Vendetta soundtrack: Evey Reborn! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,It seems amazing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I don't really understand the story/plot? It looks awesome, but what type of sci-fi movie is this exactly? "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Spoiler alert: He doesn't come back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Was bored, randomly googled interstellar and just found a new trailer immediately it dropped. My lucky day :)."
zSWdZVtXT7E,November will be a very good month.
zSWdZVtXT7E,am i the only one who thought that this trailer makes the film look boring?
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:54 What the hell is that??!?! It looks like a non-infinite universe.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This film, The Causal Angel by Hannu Rajaniemi, and Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth are the things I am most looking forward to this year. The eagerness is overwhelming!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,A Christopher Nolan film with Michael Caine?  Next you'll be telling me his brother co-wrote the screenplay.
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope Nolan finally gets his first Best Director nomination that he so rightfully deserves for Interstellar! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Gravity 2
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm sold defo watching this :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,Not sold for now.
zSWdZVtXT7E,meh
zSWdZVtXT7E,"To anyone wondering: The music in the background is from the ""V for Vendetta"" score composed by Dario Marianelli. The particular track is called ""Evey Reborn""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,does he find Jodie Foster out there?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This is going to be stunning, affecting, and right up there in the pantheon of Sci-Fi greats like Contact, The Fountain, Sunshine, Artificial Intelligence etc - films that make you THINK BIGGER."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Song: Evey Reborn by Dario Marianelli
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan ought to have learned a little more about the difficulties of space travel before embarrassing himself with this utterly implausible story. Just surviving a one way trip to Mars with suffering massive radiation poisoning is currently well beyond our means.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hans Zimmer's music is fantastic
zSWdZVtXT7E,Michael Caine!
zSWdZVtXT7E,i love this soundtrack
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ran out of food? that's it? I thought resources would fit correctly....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Kip Thorne+Nolan bros=mindblowing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Am I the only one who noticed the soundtrack is ""Evey Reborn"" from V for Vendetta? Fits perfectly the trailer, but, also feel kinda wrong cause it ""belongs"" to another movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,I didnt even need to watch the trailer to know that Michael Caine is in this Nolan movie as well.
zSWdZVtXT7E,V for Vendetta
zSWdZVtXT7E,now this looks awesome!!!.

zSWdZVtXT7E,Wormhole design stolen from Eve Online... :o
zSWdZVtXT7E,Rustin Cohle is finally accepting the universe.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Comes back as Jodie Foster's dad.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Breathing intensifies 
zSWdZVtXT7E,This must be good. Nolan has the Midas Touch right now
zSWdZVtXT7E,Isn't this song from V for Vendetta? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,thumbs up for using music from V for Vendetta  ;)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Most boring trailer EVER.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"it looks ok. But then again almost every movie by Nolan looks good, the stories are the main problem."
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow....splendid
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks interesting:)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks cewl. We need more science fiction movies that are about ideas and not dumb action schlock.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Song - ""Evey Reborn,"" by Dario Marianelli, ""V for Vendetta."""
zSWdZVtXT7E,HE WENT THREW A BLACK HOLE ! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Cross between Contact and Star Trek: First Contact, but hopefully without the Contact (does that make it ""Star Trek: First""??).  Looks amazing, can't wait.

Spoiler - he doesn't come back, but his family meets him there."
zSWdZVtXT7E,matthew mcconaughey could have been a great batman 
zSWdZVtXT7E,1° trailer di #interstellar  #scifimovie  
zSWdZVtXT7E,This better not be another Contact. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Evey Reborn, just for those who wanted to know the theme..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks amazing.
zSWdZVtXT7E,THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A TRAILER.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Check out Stephen Baxter's 'The Ark' I have a feeling Nolan was inspired by that
zSWdZVtXT7E,"*""I BELIEVE IN NOLAN""*
You can clearly see from this trailer that something big is hidden in this movie! Can't wait!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Anyone pick out that they're using the V for Vendetta music? xD Love.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This film reminds me of why I love movies, and how amazing and powerful they can be. And for those wondering, the trailer music is by composer Dario Marianelli from V for Vendetta."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Amazing trailer, I can't wait for the film.
Btw the music is from V for Vendetta 
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm intrigued! And good job for not spoiling the movie with the trailer
zSWdZVtXT7E,Eh need another trailer to to judge
zSWdZVtXT7E,that ending gave me chills. FFS NOLAN Y U SO GOOD.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks like schmaltzy, bad Hollywood-grade science crapola. Too bad... I love Nolan too.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,OH - MY - GOD.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So when the father comes back to earth, and that's if he comes back. His daughter will either be older than him or already dead since maybe even more time passed."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I am loving the soundtrack, it sounds very familiar though, I just can't put my finger on it just yet..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Matthew Mcconaughey, Christopher Nolan and Sci-fi THIS IS MY FAVOURITE THING"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan's answer to '2001'?
zSWdZVtXT7E,This movie might be so big there wont be any more SPACE in a theater for everyone!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The trailer music is dario marianelli ""v for vendetta"" track is ""evey reborn"".....I hope this movie is as epic"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Saw this before Godzilla last night. This looks amazing. Can't wait to see it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like yet another drama in a sci-fi disguise, with about 30 seconds of space scenes, and the rest being people arguing and crying. Because we are told that’s what people like. … Then don’t call it sci-fi! It’s not! (Other examples: Star Wars and Dune were both pure fantasy [sci-fi‘s retarded brother], disguised as sci-fi. Star Trek is a counter-example, as it actually was mostly sci-fi. [Keep it down, fanboys. Nobody cares.])"
zSWdZVtXT7E,And we have our next oscar champion.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Family connection = Spielberg 
Kubrick game changer - I don't think so"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Take. My. Money. Now. (please)
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:14 is that John Lithgow??
zSWdZVtXT7E,AW YISS.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Those kids are creepy n irritating esp dat girl who cast them
zSWdZVtXT7E,That music... is that the music from V for Vendetta ? I can't quite place it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"our world is already in crises and facing difficulties, isnt it ironic that we are making sci-fi movies?? do we really need fiction ?? we must focus on reality and stop this madness "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The premise that we can create technology for interstellar space travel, but can't solve a problem of how to feed the world seems a bit weak, but I'm sure this will still be an awesome movie."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Does anybody know the music for this trailer ? 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow this looks boring and cliche.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Trailer song is 
Evey Reborn by Dario Marianelli from V for Vendetta."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yup! Definitely watching this because Chris Nolan made it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yup! Definitely watching this because Chris Nolan made it!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I don't really know what this movie is about I want to watch it just because Christopher Nolan directed it.  Looks good though so yea I'm definately gonna check this one out.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I can't take this movie seriously after hearing about holistic grazing. I love science fiction that is exploratory, but so far this doesn't show any exploratory science fiction."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was that a black hole at the end there?
zSWdZVtXT7E,ohhhhhhhhhh this is soooooooooooooo good!
zSWdZVtXT7E,wow this looks gorgeous! and was that a black hole!?
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This looks epic, I really hope there are alien species in this, Ide love to see how Nolan would tackle extra terrestrials"
zSWdZVtXT7E,There is an ad before and after this ad.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks like a slightly better version of Contact, which could've been better than it actually turned out to be. Hopefully the script is good and more along the lines of Memento and Insomnia as opposed to TDK"
zSWdZVtXT7E,this looks promising 
zSWdZVtXT7E,probably long and boring
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm coming back (':
zSWdZVtXT7E,FILM OF THE YEAR 2014
zSWdZVtXT7E,is that a blackhole at the end --?

I cannot wait to see this film!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Damn this is freaking awesome!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"When Michael Caine dies, who will Christopher Nolan put in his films..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Christopher Nolan......TAKE A BOW!!!
Absolute legend."
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:54 I don't understand this bowl
zSWdZVtXT7E,incoming badnwagon Nolan fanboys.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"does anyone know what the music is/is from, or if it's original for the movie?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Ooooooohh!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks awesome, I'm in!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Absolutely stunning!!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Always love the recurring trend in Hollywood to show basically the entire plot of a movie up to the resolution of the 3rd act.....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Finally a new idea.
zSWdZVtXT7E,This trailer is already full of a billion cliches
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan We Trust
zSWdZVtXT7E,I'm watching this so hard. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,All is good but Mathew seems a little off as a trained scientist astronaut ....at one point I thought he will pull out his navy six and go baaaang
zSWdZVtXT7E,Whoa....
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks really good but the V For Vendetta soundtrack music threw me off!  They should have gotten Hans Zimmer to produce something original!
zSWdZVtXT7E,watched the teaser at least a 100 times....I don't know how many times I am going to watch this trailer............someone build a time machine and send us to November 7
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan's Space Batman
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer reminds me so much of another one of my favorite movies, Contact. Will this be Contact for the new millenium? I hope so!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,lets see all the critics shut their mouth in november
zSWdZVtXT7E,nolannaghey. Dont need anymore trailers. tickets have been purchased.
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan We Trust
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like the movie of the decade.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The trailer is very good but I can't help but think of V for Vendetta when I hear this music. I hope this is not the main theme music for Interstellar. Nevertheless I am so looking forward to another Christopher Nolan masterpiece. :)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks marvelous!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looks like a bad combination of inception and the Matrix
zSWdZVtXT7E,am i the only one who thinks that nolan is planning a series with this one???
zSWdZVtXT7E,Into the void!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awful teal and orange color grading.  Everyone is bright orange!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I honestly look forward to a world where we don't define ourselves by borders but as humanity, so we can finally advance together and not against each other.

Nice idea for a movie. :)"

zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer gives the viewer no clear idea what's going on.  He's driving around a cornfield looking at an ""Indian surveillance drone"" and then says ""solar sails will power an entire farm.""  Huh?  Then there's fire and dust in the cornfields and someone says they've run out of food.  Yet there are all these shots of healthy-looking cornfields before and after.  Then, having been a pilot (with no apparent experience as an astronaut), he's the man to fly on a spaceship whose mission will somehow save the Earth from this unexplained doom.  I'm sure the film will make more sense, but this trailer is perplexing."

Really????"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wormhole!!!! OMFG!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,OH. MY. GOODNESS.
zSWdZVtXT7E,We were never meant to save earth.. we were meant to leave it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yes, Exactly we can not keep moaning about the planets livability. In the long run we are all doomed regardless of what we do. We must leave the Earth to save Mankind! I am so happy that someone else can understand that! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Those that like the music it's from V for Vendetta and is called Evey Reborn
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music is: Evey Reborn - Dario Marianelli; From ""V for Vendetta"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,YES. I CANNOT WAIT.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"The music, couldn't place it for a while - V for Vendetta"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Freedom !!! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,They live in Smallville
zSWdZVtXT7E,welp this looks good 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Awesome. Christopher Never disappoints. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,whats with the gravitational lensing on the moons of jupiter/saturn towards the end of the trailer?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Filmed in and around Alberta - that's in Canada - which is neat
zSWdZVtXT7E,Is it the V for Vendetta soundtrack in the background? (cool trailer btw)
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait. Hawking's vision on the big screen.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Remember, remember, Interstellar in November"
zSWdZVtXT7E,that wormhole bending the lights at the end is just mindblowing
zSWdZVtXT7E,SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wonder if the Cylons will catch up?
zSWdZVtXT7E,I feel like that OMG RIBBONS Cat :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Yet another gem from Nolan I hope. BTW, does anybody else think the music is too similar to V for Vendetta?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music from V for Vendetta, i love it!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Uncle Nolan is back.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh my goodness. Goosebumps everywhere.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Murphy's law actually says: 'If there is any way to do it wrong, he'll find it.' Tired of hearing it wrong, especially because the meaning is totally stupid without any sense."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Good sign that they are not showing too much epic shots yet!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Let's remember how traveling at the speed of light effects the passing of time. That combined with the phrase ""I'm coming back"" emphasized in this trailer basically reveals the concept of this movie... I don't want to straight up ruin it for people who haven't connected the dots, but IT'S GONNA BE COOL. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope they don't spend the majority of the film on Earth. That's what it seems like in this trailer. But it could be they don't want to spoil it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Thank you, Nolan, for not revealing the entire plot of the movie for us!!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Please, put me into anabios chamber and wake me up in November."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Seems like a modern Noah's Ark.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"he's ""OK to go"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Finally a trailer that leaves you wanting more, without giving away the entire film. This could be Nolan's magnum opus, like 2001 was for Kubrick."
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan we trust.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Just wow.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"wow this looks huge !
how shall i wait till november???"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Memento - Masterpiece
Insomnia - Haven't seen it
Batman Begins - Great
Prestige - His best non-comic book movie, masterpiece
The Dark Knight - Masterpiece
Inception - Masterpiece
The Dark Knight Rises - His weakest movie but still good

Christopher Nolan has never made a bad movie and he's been one of the the most influential directors of the past decade."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope they're using some form of Warp/Alcubierre drive, it sure looks like it.. And it would explain how the main character thinks he can return home, without too much time passing.
The effects look pretty wild, and the warping of space/light around the ship is somewhat realistic. :D"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Oh this looks so Good...and the Music *.*
zSWdZVtXT7E,"CAN""T WAIT! NOLAN ROCKS!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,YES YES YES! I CANT WAIT!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Yes Yes Yes.
zSWdZVtXT7E,he's not comin back
zSWdZVtXT7E,Omg
zSWdZVtXT7E,Reminnds me of 'Voices of a Distant Star'
zSWdZVtXT7E,That music was taken from V for Vendetta.  
zSWdZVtXT7E,Sooo sicckkk
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hesaidshesaidmv it's from 'V for Vendetta'..the tracknis called 'Evey Reborn'. Amazing trailer!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the background music is good but thats about it on this trailer. Looks like a dumb storyline to be honest, whats going to happen is he going to get lost in space? theres only so many possibilities you can do with a space movie"
zSWdZVtXT7E,what the
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'm so glad I watched this right after it's uploaded. And man.. My jaw, just hit the floor.﻿"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I just watched it and my heart cant stop racing, This movie looks so good, i'm .. wow.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Valerie's Letter
zSWdZVtXT7E,well now I'm hyped :D
zSWdZVtXT7E,I hope if they release another trailer that they wont show too much... This trailer is perfect it got me interested and it doesnt show me the whole movie... And that music pulls at my heart strings lol
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nope we're meant to save the world....
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wake me up when october ends
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Landmark film.
This - ladies & gentlemen - this will change cinema as we know it."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan's next!!!  Hope this isn't as bad as The Dark Knight Rises.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"For those interested in music, it's from V for Vendetta's score named ""Evey Reborn"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,Where do I know the song from?
zSWdZVtXT7E,i no it will be great bt i am still nt able to anticipate the sci-fi angle of this movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,So a father would leave his small children to go to another planet or whatever? Thats the most bullshit thing I´ve seen in any sci-fi movie.
zSWdZVtXT7E,YES
zSWdZVtXT7E,Thank you.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Looking forward to this.  Christopher Nolan is one of my top 50 directors of the 21st century.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Alright, Alright, Alright!..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,One word....A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What's the name of the music in the background. I've heard it before, but I just can't place it!﻿
Edit: nevermind, it's from V for Vendetta - Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn in case anyone else wanted to know."
zSWdZVtXT7E,An instant masterpiece this will be... IN NOLAN WE TRUST !!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Meh. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,can anybody write the whole text of this trailer?I mean English subtitles
zSWdZVtXT7E,"We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it"". Republican agenda confirmed Nolan."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"BRING IT ON!!! (sorry, I'm excited and it's Friday)"
zSWdZVtXT7E,I can't wait. Been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks a bit ho-hum.
"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music from ""V for Vandetta""  ""Evey Reborn"""
zSWdZVtXT7E,"A humble farming guy who happens to be a genius gets asked (probably by a powerful governmental type body) to look for other places that humanity could go live because the rest of us are just stupid animals that shouldn't be involved in this process, BUT WAIT, there's emotional tension because he has kids that don't want him to go.  Wow....  creative....  Let me guess, there's gonna be THAT scene where he's like, ""I'm not going!  You know my past...  I just want to be left alone with my family"" but he does it anyways because the script says so.  I hope I'm terribly wrong about this though."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"So Matthew McConaughey is going to cross the event horizon of a black hole... Alright, alright."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I got a dog a few months back and called him Murphy because he is a total asshole, also because I got a Papa Murphy's take-n-bake. I left it in the kitchen for 5 minutes and he pulled it off the counter, ate the whole raw pizza then had diarrhea all over the carpet. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"What?  Optimistic sci-fi?  Zounds!

Quite excited.  Some very good talent on display here, and the plot seems interesting."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Michael Caine over-load. And it doesn't look like you will be back, Matthew."
zSWdZVtXT7E,That music alone. ^^ Gives me chills.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"On the whole, this looks great. 
One major bone to pick however. Engineers don't make planes and television sets. Engineers play a part in realizing these technologies, but more correctly - Engineers solve problems."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I'll watch it, if not just for the visual effects alone."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks terrible, Matthew is all wrong for this. "
zSWdZVtXT7E,"gimme gimme, nom nom nom"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Music reminds me of the best scene in ""V for Vendetta""."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Seems interesting. But this trailer showed quite a bit. I am curious to see how much the final film continues after the ship warps at the end. Is that when the credits roll? Or is that the first half of the movie? Will they spend the rest of the film finding Earth's replacement? Another planet we can rape until satisfied? Humans are a cancer.
zSWdZVtXT7E,IN!...Still.
zSWdZVtXT7E,The Mcconaissance hits again!
zSWdZVtXT7E,This looks great. And the soundtrack makes me wish so hard that this will turn out as great as it can.
zSWdZVtXT7E,NOW THAT'S A GOOD TRAILER
zSWdZVtXT7E,God is in the rain
zSWdZVtXT7E,I need to watch this so badly... my soul needs it.
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Absolutely love Michael Caine, great to see him with Nolan again. Same guys behind this as the Dark Knight Trilogy so you know it will be top grade filmmaking. Only 6 months away :("
zSWdZVtXT7E,"This trailer made me shiver, then tear up in anticipation.  I'm so looking forward to this."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Honestly, not as cool nor hard core as I'd hoped, the CGI is average.."
zSWdZVtXT7E,ПИКАБУ))
zSWdZVtXT7E,Take my money!
zSWdZVtXT7E,I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Im absolutely not sold.  
zSWdZVtXT7E,"I hope Nolan doesn´t make characters talking about the plot 3 fucking times in the movie to explain audience what is going on:

Inception and the dream between a dream concept."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i hope the movie was better than this trailer. 

the first interstellar teaser was and still is going to be the best one IMO"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Can't wait for this... I'm sure Nolan won't disappoint.
zSWdZVtXT7E,^~^
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Eh. Looks great but silly dialog. What would you expect your kid's reaction to be when they're named after ""Murphy's Law?"" 

Also, the world doesn't need engineers? But you are running out of food..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,if was was suppose to leave earth god would have told us to. u saw what happen when we built the towers of babalon an u will see we aint fit for space...u cant even breath up there
zSWdZVtXT7E,Geilo! 8D
zSWdZVtXT7E,"November, realy? Nolan, Why you so cruel? I CAN'T WAIT."
zSWdZVtXT7E,dat V for Vendetta music
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Was the trailer before Godzilla a little expanded one? Because I definetely remember a different beginning of the trailer and a phrase ""I'm coming back"" to be said twice in the end, not single time like here."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"you are fucking insane director Mr Nolan, hats off! blowed off just with a trailer"

zSWdZVtXT7E,MUST HAVE!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,loooks shit
zSWdZVtXT7E,BOOM ..My jaw just hit the floor ! This movie looks like a classic Sci-Fi Landmark ! ..CARLOSINHOLLYWOOD .
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Фильм от Нолана. Наконец то. Я твердо убежден в том, что он не подкачает."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Seems like the little girl will grow up to be played by Jessica Chastain and Matthew's character will probably come back like he hasn't aged much, laws of relatively and or the wormhole effect. Can't wait ! "
zSWdZVtXT7E,I wanna see more :(
zSWdZVtXT7E,"*FOR THE RECORD:* I NOW WATCH THIS TRAILER AS THE VIEW COUNT  REMAINS AT 301 VIEWS, 1226 LIKES AND 18 DISLIKES.

LET ALL WHO GAZE UPON THIS MONUMENT OF TEXT KNOW, THAT I HAVE ACHIEVED THE *INB4 MASS PUBLIC*."
zSWdZVtXT7E,In Nolan we trust!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Well this is majorly different then the screenplay. No AI robots, nor the drone being a NASA space sat. The kid was also a boy.  "
zSWdZVtXT7E,Dammit Nolan! You're toying with my emotions! This was spectacular! 
zSWdZVtXT7E,Song: Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn (V for Vendetta Soundtrack)

zSWdZVtXT7E,"Song: Dario Marianelli - Evey Reborn. No. 8 of V for Vendetta OST.

Remember remember the 5th of November"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Looks good, but I definitely miss wally pfister's cinematography. This doesn't ""look"" like a Nolan film. Looks good though, and it most likely will be."
zSWdZVtXT7E,"i have to say that was a real let down, it doesn't look bad but there nothing to really get excited about either"
zSWdZVtXT7E,so beautiful!
zSWdZVtXT7E,just keep livin' !
zSWdZVtXT7E,"when it is november, when it is released, then you have my permission to watch"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Be very very careful.... you write a story entirely based on physics, you better pay close attention to whether or not they make sense.

Also: if the world is running out of food, we *do* need engineers to devise plans for us to devise a new food source or supplement.  No one of any scientific means would ever say we don't need engineers."
zSWdZVtXT7E,yes ye syesyes yes ysey yse YEEEES YESSES YESSSS!S!!! YESSSS!!!!!!!!!!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Christopher Nolan is Coming Back. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"the Science part looks good. not sure about the Fiction part though, this "" we gotta leave/abandon Earth mission "" feels overplayed, but it seems Cohle has to leave in order to save Earth, not to abandon it. might actually turn out to be something interesting, rather than sloppy and boring or clichéd. also, it involves flying into Black Holes, so that is a guarantee for mad great."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Finally a good sci fi movie. It feels like we have had a dry spell.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Im a lil meh about this. I mean I know Chris Nolan made it but this trailer was a little boring.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Last trailer I'm going to watch for this movie. This is going to be EPIC... like 6th sense epic.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Wow... this movie is going to turn me into an emotional wreck. 
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Calling it now, Casey Affleck is Mathew McConaughey's son grown up and Jessica Chastain is his daughter grown up!!"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Aaaand nobody saying about Matthew... Just Nolan.=)
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Wow, that was dull"
zSWdZVtXT7E,Good LORD am I hard for this movie. Guaranteed big screen day 1. Must watch.
zSWdZVtXT7E,Nolan. OMG
zSWdZVtXT7E,OH MY GOD 0____________O
zSWdZVtXT7E,Woo! great use of Evey Reborn.
zSWdZVtXT7E,1:48 was poweful
zSWdZVtXT7E,"Is this the Hans Zimmer score accompanying this, or is it a different piece of music?"
zSWdZVtXT7E,"And of course Michael Caine is there...:-)
Waiting for another Masterpiece by Nolan..."
zSWdZVtXT7E,Time travel. Outer Space. and Nolan. this is going to be the best movie of our times!
zSWdZVtXT7E,Was those starts at the end shaped like a bat!?
zSWdZVtXT7E,Hey - thats the soundtrack for V for Vendetta!

zSWdZVtXT7E,Hope this will be good. I lost faith in Nolan after those awful Batman movies. but this looks good

zSWdZVtXT7E,"In Nolan we Trust !

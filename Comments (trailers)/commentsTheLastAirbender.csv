-egQ79OrYCs,"@34099832 it's zuko. just sayin. Also, since when did Aang's arrow have a design? and a giant design of designs on the back. It should just be a straight light blue arrow going on his head and down his spine."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The film so far has received almost universally negative reviews, earning an 7% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite flashy special effects, The Last Airbender squanders the potential of its popular source material on an incomprehensible plot, laughable dialogue, and a joyless sense of detachment. Roger Ebert gave the film half a star in his review, stating that it ""bores and alienates its audiences,"" and notes the poor use of 3D among the film's faults."
-egQ79OrYCs,"guys they are going to be cutting the kyoshi warriors out, and plus aangs name is gonna now be pronounced uung....... wtf.
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I love how everyone is bitching.
How many times have movies actually been extremely relevant to their original counterparts?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Changing the pronunciation of the name Aang in the movie really pisses me off.
-egQ79OrYCs,@WaffleKiller09 really? im pretty sure its all 4 combined
-egQ79OrYCs,WHERE DO THE ASIANS COME IN?!?!?!? WHY DOES UNCLE AND ZUKO LOOK UGLY T^T
-egQ79OrYCs,"@BadYam993 Katara is on i think, i dont ang i gonna be as happy as he was, i think he is gonna be cool though. It will be different the the nick one but i think ill like it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"mm well i saw the cartoon when i was 12 years old jaja, now i am 14 XD,jaja but the movie looks good, awesome special effects and maybe god plot :], waitin for harry potter the deadly hollows :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"jajaja, i like the cartoon when i was 12 years old jaja, now i am 14 XD but mm the movie its ok jaja, so i will see it, and waiting harry potter the deadly hollows :D,
Hurricane Alex :/"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Okay um....This looks NOTHING like the show, which kinda pisses me off.  I mean, if you are going to use someone's story to make a movie, don't make it yours.  It's not your idea to mold and mix and smush into something else."
-egQ79OrYCs,I would have put the guy who plays Zuko to play Sakka instead. And Zuko should of been a light Asian person with a faded red scar.
-egQ79OrYCs,damn it! i thought at least zuko would be hot :c
-egQ79OrYCs,"Obviously Toph isn't in this movie, she comes in the second season. >_>

The casting people did a terrible job. Katara and Sokka need a tan. Zuko needs to be bleached, and his hair isn't even right. Uncle Iroh is completely off. And Aang has a fat baby face. :( "
-egQ79OrYCs,@Pianoplayer009 yeah like how prince of persia was a whiteboy...
-egQ79OrYCs,@bigred787eb its my fav too! im going to watch the the movie tomorrow though im sure the plots getting screwed a lot from being summarized a lot 
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow. I've only seen 3.5 episodes and they look way better then this movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,awsome
-egQ79OrYCs,awsome
-egQ79OrYCs,@apluskel ya aang kissed her 1 time to find there way out of a under ground place and another time was when he was going to fight to fire king and kissed her and flew off and he did not find the fire king that time and maybe something will happen at the end
-egQ79OrYCs,"@pwnage122334 

me to. I loved the show and I am excited to see this just for for fun ya know but what made the show so great was all the antics. Especially sokka lmao. This is probbaly going to a be a more mellowed down version of it. Plus aang was such ha pacifist in the anime and now he looks like he is about to ready to murder."
-egQ79OrYCs,aww i loved the cartoon/anime -meh- version could be worth seeing how well they did it this time. Seeing as they totally messed up dragon ball Z - although it was good... just disapointing compeared to the anime.
-egQ79OrYCs,i gueessss this movieeee is gona aaa rockkkkk........
-egQ79OrYCs,@kingofepic  they put the scar on his face? what i didint notice it!
-egQ79OrYCs,@kingofepic I agree. It should have been more pronounced. I also liked his shaved head with the ponytail look
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm surprised I havent seen a single comment on the relationship between Katara and Aang - I havent watched all of the episodes so I don't know their fate but apparently there is some sort of emotional connection between them
-egQ79OrYCs,I have a bad feeling that everyones gonna be too serious
-egQ79OrYCs,"it's right..these trailers show a lot of bending and action to seduce the audience. I think, btw - that the actor of zuko is allright. But is it just me - or has somebodyelse also imagined aang being a lot more skinnier? ^^"
-egQ79OrYCs,"watch the cartoon, it's awesome. FYI, it's made from the cartoon"
-egQ79OrYCs,ya i dont like the casting for zuko at all....im sorry but he looks nothing like zuko. it just doesnt seem right. and uncle iroh doesnt look right either he looks like a rackity shack ho bo. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't think I'm really that bothered about the non-asian cast, but from all the trailers I've seen it looks like they've changed the personalities, which I'm not happy about. Hopefully it's just to make it look more epic or something, but if Sokka isn't the meat and sarcasm guy and Aang isn't happy-go-lucky and fun loving then I really don't think I'll like it."
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope that the rumour are not true about the movie being suck .
-egQ79OrYCs,Can't wait! 
-egQ79OrYCs,I just hope it has the humour from the TV series.
-egQ79OrYCs,"It looks amazing!!! 
But why is Zuko so ugly???
HeÂ´s my favorite character!!! T_T"
-egQ79OrYCs,Dyed black hair is not good enough. We need an asian in this movie!
-egQ79OrYCs,Hollywood must be on some cactus juice whenever they pick the cast.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@YpaN1ck ahh, a newcomer to the series? well, let me congratulate you on that prestigious achievement with a congratulatory spit on the ground. 

just bcuz you seen the avatar on nickelodeon by watching all three seasons in three weeks;doesn't mean squat.  i know im being direct, but I dont like to tease one another with comments. I'm more of a in-your-face kinda guy. 

So that being said. I still disagree. they make perfect earthbenders, though. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@YpaN1ck no, Asians would not fit the role. the cast is perfect. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@iverray13 have you ever seen the cartoon or take the time to know that his is only book 1: water? no, you didn't. 

This is Book 1: Water. Book 2 will release if this movie is successful. Which to me, it might not. I'm hoping for the best, but seeing how this movie was rushed and lacks character development is a huge turnoff. 

Hopefully I'm wrong, though. 

/hopes for the best. "
-egQ79OrYCs,@YpaN1ck So what race would you suggest?
-egQ79OrYCs,@iverray13 because the movie only covered the book 1 of avatar. :(
-egQ79OrYCs,who is that playing zuko?Is that the boy frm millonare or smthin?  The zuko in cartoon was more handsome even with his bigger scar. I'm going to hate anyone who made this movie!! indians the fire nation???and i was being exited! 
-egQ79OrYCs,so sad why theres no TOPH???
-egQ79OrYCs,"O my god!! i didn't know film was being made!!!! Aaaaaaaa, i am sooooooooooo exited!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i am getting worried cause when they do this kinda stuff to cartoons most of them fail
i dont want this movie to fail, but at the moment it seems like it will. im not going to the cinema to watch a crappy version of a cartoon i love, i just wont
and cartoons arent the only victims here: so are books
fingers crossed that this movie will be like the cartoon we all love some much"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@simonea214  i think toph will have her appearance on the second installment of this movie.. 'coz in the series, she's on book 2 - Earth. and this is only the first installment - water.. because i guess each movie is equal to one book in the series.."
-egQ79OrYCs,":O!!! WHERE APPA ?!
i forgot the name.. it was really long not watching the show again.."
-egQ79OrYCs,DAMn why is katara ugly D=
-egQ79OrYCs,why does appa have momo's face ????? just look at the trailer 
-egQ79OrYCs,"In the cartoon, Aang has blue eyes, but Noah is cute. I can't wait to see it :)  "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ricecakes713 well that PLANET, is asian-influenced, and asia is a continent, not a country dude :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@simonea214 I hope not they need to save hey for the second part being thats when she enters the story, book 2 EARTH."
-egQ79OrYCs,i think this movie looks really cool BUT i think the casting was all wrong. im not saying that the acting is gunna be bad BUT i thought there would be more asians cuz ya know the whole series is set in ASIA??? hollywood needs to stop whitewashing. like seriously.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DramaMC Technically Katara, Sokka and the rest of the Northern and Southern water tribes are supposed to represent Inuit and other first nation tribes (If you've ever looked up other first nation culture a lot of the Water Tribe stuff is drawn from that."
-egQ79OrYCs,@DuchessAliana It's not done right and hardly visible in most lighting. Plus now Iroh looks like a totally different person instead of the insightful tea drinking guy. The whole show got altered and Aang doesn't seem to have his childlike personality that I enjoyed in the cartoon series.
-egQ79OrYCs,@tiger2hunt4me I agree.
-egQ79OrYCs,@Cerridwen247 !!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DramaMC  God Bless you too!
Exactly;even if they did get the ethnicities wrong they could of at least done the characters justice;with actors that were able to carry out the rolls without pissing so many people off:  I mean the dude from Twilight? Really?  And giving the roll to a slow moving chubby kid ha ha.  Reminds me of that episode in the series where the main characters went to go watch a play of their adventure so far lol."
-egQ79OrYCs,"whats the name of song?'??'

"
-egQ79OrYCs,"espero quesi este genial
y no como la mierda
de 
dragonball"
-egQ79OrYCs,@textingtruth ya theyre doing it in 3 movies
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

Plus context makes a whole lot of difference in rather something is racist or not. Even the director has said that he wanted to cast more races to help distinguish the nations. So is it more racist to say that no other race should be cast or that more races should be represented. This brings me to the point I was making earlier regarding the race being more of a stylistic choice to distinguish nations (like the architecture) rather then a race based choice as many bigots claim."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

Your best response is that the creators,  the Indian American  director and the rest of the crew are secret racists. Because it was the director that made the decision and it was the creators of the show that gave the artistic OK. The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence but it is wrong to accuse racism when their is no outright evidence. It would be wrong of to accuse racism if the only evidence is that they perceive the characters to be Asian. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Zurie53225 
The only thing based off Asian culture in avatar was the buildings and fire nation fighting style, Mike and Brian stated that."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Dragon ball z real life
Avatar real life
Naruto SOON :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I smell a stinker. It may just be me, but this may be a disappointing as Dragon Ball evolution."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@dawnwildcat 
Yeah"
-egQ79OrYCs,"isn't that guy featuring zuko the protagonist of ""who wants to be a milionaire?""?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Are you guys seriously not going to see a movie because of the cast? Just because they don't resemble DRAWN characters? You guys are missing out -if anything you should worry about is the director! The cast is full of great actors(despite the new-comers, we'll see how they are) and you guys are only focusing on looks. You guys are reading this book by it's cover."
-egQ79OrYCs,"People must understand, what looks good animated, doesn't look good when in live action or CGI. So not everything is going to be an exact mirror image of what we see in the cartoon.

I will go see this. Although I know it won't be number one in the box office, because it comes out the same week as Eclipse. There is way too many middle age fat wives and there anti-social prepubescent daughters drooling over Edward Cullen, so unfortunately that movie is going to sell like hotcakes."
-egQ79OrYCs,"This makes me sick.  I would have watched it had they cast it right.  Not only did they completely f up the race of the characters, but the show had a distinctly asian vibe which is now totally lost.  It turns it into just another percy jackson or harry potter movie.  Idiots, the marketing team really f'd up on this one.

Not to mention Aang has lost all his child-like wonderment and enthusiasm, which is what endeared him to audiences.  Now he's just Batman jr."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang looks quite cute and okay, plus his movements fit the character. 
Yaaay for Sokka. Katara is okay I guess but...Zuko, what the hell did 
they do to you???"
-egQ79OrYCs,@kenz0r1337 Appa and Momo are both in it. Momo is CG and they still couldn't get him right. His ears are smaller than they are supposed to be and they're the same color as his dark fur. Like a dark brown or something. Apparently no one bothered to look and see that his ears are the same color as the rest of his head.
-egQ79OrYCs,I LOVE  THIS VIDEO. I SO WANT TO GO SEE THE MOVIE. MAN I LOVE THE CARTOON SHOWS TOO. CAN'T WAIT!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,@downsidemushroom its goin 2 b a trilogy following the tv series...Toph might be in the second movie :D I hope they cast someone actually asian theres like only 3 people that r asian in this movie and hte series is based off asian martial arts and mythology >.<
-egQ79OrYCs,"@downsidemushroom There making a Trilogy, each movie is a season/book. So she'll be in the second one, i think. "
-egQ79OrYCs,@downsidemushroom  I kno there better be more than one movie cuz the cartoon was long as fuck and if they try to squeeze everything into one movie it would really really suck...lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"@downsidemushroom let me think...
THAT IS NOT UNTIL THE SECCOND SEASON! "
-egQ79OrYCs,@moopfather i know man this is nothing like the real story and charcters
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang's suppose to be happy and playful, in this hes serious about the war :( Cant wait till it comes out. Today is the last day of school for me :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Anybody know if they are going to do the Aunt Wu scene? I hope its in it, cuz i love that Katara realizes it could be Aang"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Bueno ya sabemos comoacaba
"
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG!!! i watched all of the cartoon of Avatar the last airbender...and now i cant wait tot see the movie!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Hope this has comedy in it like the cartoon otherwise I probably wont enjoy it very much ^^;
-egQ79OrYCs,"omg, they pulled a dragonball evolution"
-egQ79OrYCs,OK Where the hells is Zuko's scar and why do Zuko and Iroh look more middle eastern than Asian? Seriously! This is just so wrong!
-egQ79OrYCs,@moopfather No you're not! 
-egQ79OrYCs,@downsidemushroom This is from the 1st season. But realy where's Zuko's scar? Don't tell me someone forgot that vital piece of stage make up!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@moopfather  you aren't the only one hating the casting choices.

It's kinda funny though how the good guys who are Katara and Sokka are white but in the series they are black(or indian at least).  And Zuko the bad guy who was white in the series is black in this movie... 

Hmmm..."
-egQ79OrYCs,@moopfather 
-egQ79OrYCs,the real avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,and i agree that i dont like the casting... lol my friend said that the chick (katara) looked more like a dude then the guy (aang). just saying they couldve done a better job in that department :P
-egQ79OrYCs,Are they going to try to fit all of book one into it?... if so just how long is this movie going to have to be without it being too crunched together.
-egQ79OrYCs,@xkawaiixkunoichix God bless You!
-egQ79OrYCs,dear hollywood: STOP WHITEWASHING OUR FUCKING FAVORITE MATERIALS!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"man u all gotta watch this movie i even have the hole collection of last airbinder. hmmm wtf the chaRATERS should of been asians instead its base off of the tv series. I think asian should of been the charaters instead they fight way better but o well , lets hope the storyline follows the tv series and as far i can tell this movies go as far as the end of season 1 so theres gotta be at least 3 movies there makeing."
-egQ79OrYCs,the casting stinks :T
-egQ79OrYCs,i think one guy is the person from slumdog
-egQ79OrYCs,i think this movie focus only in BOOK 1..
-egQ79OrYCs,"The moves are nicely done. I really want to see this. Hope they won't let Appa and Momo out, and of course King Bumi!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko's scar sucks they did a horrible job!
-egQ79OrYCs,@downsidemushroom i think they are doing a movie for each book (thats what i heard) and Toph didnt come in till book 2 i believe
-egQ79OrYCs,@moopfather im mass hating it..
-egQ79OrYCs,needs more asian characters.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@cristybutit79 me neither, i really hope it's awesome because if it isn't, sucks for the next two sequels coming."
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie looks so terrible but im going to watch it anyways 
-egQ79OrYCs,@aznsteve128 alrighty then. 
-egQ79OrYCs,whats the soundtrack to this?
-egQ79OrYCs,@AlvaroGHCH yes the two brothers have  dark skin and zuko is more handsome than this guy
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope I'm not the only one hating the casting choices.
-egQ79OrYCs,Any particular reason why Zuko has no burn scar?
-egQ79OrYCs,@jiajie0 hellzzz yes
-egQ79OrYCs,"sigh i bet asian acters would of been better..
i guess there not good enough for the media still Y-Y"
-egQ79OrYCs,@downsidemushroom Toph doesn't come until book 2.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@jiajie0 Whenever they do things like this, the cartoon always is. *sigh* I really hope they don't mess up!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@downsidemushroom  she will be in the second movie  it will be a trillogy
-egQ79OrYCs,when can there be a real Asian on these movie? ''/ 
-egQ79OrYCs,So does Sokka get to fuck the moon in this one?
-egQ79OrYCs,one of the actor is from slum dog millionaire.... 
-egQ79OrYCs,@PFroe111 In the show he wuz such a kid. He wuz NOT serious like he is in the movie..
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ok.. the airbender actor can;t act for shit. ""I will stop them."" ""I am ready"". ""I can't act for shit"".

THis movie will be chock full of terrible acting. Plus it's directed by M. Night Hackalon.. the worst director since Uwe Boll. THis movie is guaranteed to suck. Nothing about this looks interesting. 
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@JUNDABUGG he got the rights to the name 9 years ago, probably before the show was even thought of"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Concept3601 
I've got your back"
-egQ79OrYCs,"oh man, what's the name of that song?"
-egQ79OrYCs,has anyone else noticed the casting for uncle iroh? he does not fit the animated character at all... its so sad.. he was one of my favorite characters...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lilmisspimpin36 
your rambling is stupid

1. Zuko does have a scar
2. THIS IS BOOK 1
3. Zuko has no race in the cartoon
4. Yeah in BOOK 3
5. And she dies in the movie too
6. The arrow looks fine it would look stupid if it was plain blue"
-egQ79OrYCs,if twilight hinders the success of this movie i will kill the twi-tards...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@9308pink  I agree completely! Im tired of hearing about racism, how white the characters are, blah blah blah!! The cartoons mixed up the cultural stuff with different people, it wasnt all on a certain race to have a certain bending ability. All i know is the reviews are good which is why they moved it up a day, people who have never heard of the show love the movie, so im ready for The Last Aribender. I think itll be awesome. And i am a fan of the cartoons, but i think this movie will be fine."
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh my god people shut the fuck up stop comparing this to the cartoon!Of course their not going to make it as the book & cartoon they never do in movies.If you guys don't wanna watch the movie then watch the cartoon and stop complaining or go make the movie yourself if you think the movie will suck gosh kids these days!
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang is too serious zuko doesn't have the scar, and aang's arrow looks funny...but i'm still going to go see it"
-egQ79OrYCs,the woman voice at the end of the trailer sound same as gaia from god of war :P
-egQ79OrYCs,hollywood fcked up big time
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lilmisspimpin36 
1.) Zuko has a smaller/less pronounced scar on his face
2.) This is Book 1- no need for Azula or Toph yet
3.) In this movie...
Air Nomads are multi-ethnic
Earth Kingdom are largely Chinese
Fire Nation are Indian/South Asian
Water Tribes are split- South is Inuit and North is white
4.) Again Book 1- the closest they get to friends is the Blue Spirit busting Aang out of prison.
5.) Yue does die.  Why are you assuming that she will survive?
6.) Aang's arrow tattoo looks blue to me"
-egQ79OrYCs,@kaileighelisabeth This movie only covers Book 1
-egQ79OrYCs,"@autumnrocksfall nah dude, this is only book 1"
-egQ79OrYCs,looks to fake!
-egQ79OrYCs,@lilmisspimpin36 you just see the trailer not the entire movie dumb ass! god
-egQ79OrYCs,"The movie itself looks pretty decent, but the casting is just terrible.  Aang is like alright, but Sokka and Katara are not white.  I would have liked Zuko to be more Japanese, because Indian just doesn't seem to fit his character, but I guess it's alright.  Just Sokka and Katara are so completely wrong, they're meant to be like brown eskimo's not white kids.  Honestly I think this is M. Night Shyamalans attempt at appeasing to the white people running Hollywood, he's trying to be white."
-egQ79OrYCs,@lilmisspimpin36 They're basing the movie off of the first part of the animated series where Aang is learning water bending.   They're only doing book 1 water.
-egQ79OrYCs,"How much of the story line is the movie supposed to span? I really hope they don't try to squeeze in all 3 seasons. And I hope the characters haven't lost all of their goofiness. Without their lighthearted nature, I'm afraid it is going to be too dramatic."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 you know what, i guess your right because i was looking at some other movies that did bad casting and i was really mad, like dragon ball z, i really hated how they changed the story and the Goku wasn't even asian or cool looking. well even though it's like that are you still gonna watch it, because i am, i got to support my favorite show."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm pretty sure it WILL be awesome, but not as awesome as the cartoon series.
Keep in mind how long it took the series to tell that story. I hope they dont try to tell all of it in one single movie !"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 
Yeah it is, i added the smily to help indicate but i guess that didnt work^^"
-egQ79OrYCs,can't wait
-egQ79OrYCs,"you know, they have tried really hard to get this movie complete, you can't expect them to get high expectations, it's really hard, nobody's perfect."
-egQ79OrYCs,when it will release at malaysia??
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf?aang got a christian cross behind?not to be racist or something.but is just an arrow.better watch the animated
-egQ79OrYCs,"WTH....that dude gnna be zuko ?! huh...this movie will be suck ! 
btw i think it will be better he takes the asia dude...hah"
-egQ79OrYCs,@tienschwiesow48 couldn't find it on there.
-egQ79OrYCs,i think it's going tbe sucks like the dragon ball
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks good to me. i cant wait
-egQ79OrYCs,dumb fuckers! imagine Kyoshi doing her avatar state while she splits Kyoshi island away from the main land! i cant imagine how cool is that!
-egQ79OrYCs,lol looked like their trying to do some 300 slow mo sound effect things everynow and then
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie looks awesome and looks like it has really great special effects and etc. it's just that the actors chosen to play the characters are not suited. i mean come on,, dev patel as zuko???..... zuko's not supposed to be indian -_-"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Im just going to pretend this has nothing to do with the original, which i love, because whether or not its accurate to the original, it still looks like its gonna kick ass!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sasoriwuvr139 He has The Scar in The Film . It`s just hard to make out in The Trailers . If ya look in The stills , Zuko`s Scar is there ."
-egQ79OrYCs,@klascore1  its not on there. It has Star Trek on their Last Airbender page.
-egQ79OrYCs,"personally i think that zukos character should of been made more closely to the cartoon, not that the actor should be diffferent just that his hair and scar and such should be different he looks more like post side change zuko than anti aang zuko imo"
-egQ79OrYCs,"so, in one word, is it a good movie that must be seen?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

By them just being kids they have little or no acting experiences. Ringer was hired b/c of his martial arts skills, and Peltz was hired because of her acting. Plus we weren't there during casting and don't know the choices they had and what the director wanted to say anything otherwise would be speculation which is what most o f the criticism is based on. No one internal said the casting was racial just the outside groups which makes the criticism highly suspect."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

I've heard the exact opposite."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

If the acting and direction was well done then It wouldn't be a problem because that type of casting happens all the time in acting. I once saw Ebenezer Scrooge be portrayed by a black actor. If he is the best for the job then it would be racist to deny him that role. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

Then are the races also stylistic choices as well. My point is Inuits aren't Asians and secondly it is a cartoon and the culture is made up. There are no earthbenders walking around and the story appears to be the exact same story with East Asian references and all. So if the whole issue with race is just one outside group having a tantrum. When the creators were satisfied with it, then there shouldn't have been a problem. But again racism swings both ways."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

I happen to think if it is  the right person for the job they should cast it race doesn't have to be an issue. I seen plays where traditionally white characters get portrayed by black actors. By your standards that is just as much a crime as portraying characters loosely based off Asian cultures by white people. And with all the fuss from what I seen only the water tribe and Ang seem to be white with the Fire Nation being Indian, and most of the nomads being Asian as well."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

Your argument against the eye color disproves your own argument. Just because the air nomads dress like Tibetan monks don't mean they are Tibetans. For example the Northern water tribe city was also model after Venice, and Panama City neither are which are Asian culture. The water tribes were never Asian and to say so shows how little you know. The Southern Tribes were base off Inuits in Northern America, and the Northern tribes seem to be based on Northern Europeans. "
-egQ79OrYCs,Nickelodeon and the creators of avatar obviously approved this so there should be no people getting mad at M. night or Paramount....
-egQ79OrYCs,@is5150  they were on the cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

Air Nomads were inspired by Tibetan monks, Just like the Earth Kingdom was inspired by China, and Southern Water tribe was inspired by inuits, but the northern water tribe clearly had  features like blue eyes which is not common in Asian cultures and in fact most common and Northern Europe so to case Sokka and Katara as white actors is not far fetch. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 

The problem is that it is a cartoon and the fact people are calling racist before actually watching the movie. It was like calling the Passion of the Christ anti-semetic because it portrays Jews in a negative light despite Jesus and most of his disciples being Jews. Racism swings both ways and I don't think it is fair just say it is racist because the cast white actors. No one complain when the cast a white guy as Goku so why complain now."
-egQ79OrYCs,its funny how people expect  everything and everyone from the movie in the trailers
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope that they don't make it different from the cartoon I'm disappointed in the cartoon prince was hot and katara only had one braid but i still can't wait
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't see any of these actors as the characters they portray. It's just too... different. I don't think you can make a live-action film for Avatar. It's just not right without the animated characters.
-egQ79OrYCs,@JiaSher1 Hes the fucking avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,"@CrossOverNATION there are no mexicans in the main cast, smart one! aang's actor is white (supposedly), Devko i South Asian and Iroh's Persian."
-egQ79OrYCs,@XxXMyLittleBooXxX I think it's hard to find someone that looks like an animated person -.-
-egQ79OrYCs,why does Aang look so serious??
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 
What and have a dirty brownskin play the hero in a hollywood production? ;p"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@is5150 Well they were certainly darker! They were kind of Native American-ish. They're all too white. In the show they were different types of Asian. The fire nation was more Chinese, the Kyoshi warriors more Japanese. M. Night Shamalan kind of sucks. Alot. I might watch it if I could see more of how he represented the characters."
-egQ79OrYCs,i thought sokka and katara was black 
-egQ79OrYCs,the actos r all messed up.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Looks like a must see!
Excapt that Aang in the tv series is always happy, and in this movie he looks more series then ever!
Oh well still looks like a great movie!"
-egQ79OrYCs,were's Zuko's scar and the Aang in the cartoon is a pacifist but the one in the movie looks like he loves to fight
-egQ79OrYCs,@AsianTaliban i know thay was black now thay white imnot trying to be raices yall sorry 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@aznsteve128 yah, but it's a cartoon, it's not that big of a deal. and people are making it a big deal. do you really want to see an all asian movie, then go to asia. this is an american cartoon, gees. it's not a manga or an anime. people need to stop being racial about it. I am more worried about the actors being more like their characters then the culture of the cartoon.
 NO matter what though, i am still gonna watch it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@marvinlingling123 im pretty sure its there and looks close to the toons. on the other hand of races... i never saw aang as asian in the cartoon... fire nation seemed quite asian, and some of the air nomads... water seemed the closest to caucasian and earth somehow resembled china a lot (not generic asian but more specific). "
-egQ79OrYCs,What happened to the funny?
-egQ79OrYCs,zukos uncle looks like crap
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara's and Sakka's body tamplation not match but I think the voice givers from cartoon are actors there :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@marvinlingling123 There is Appa and looks really shitty 
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant wait first twilight now avatar JULY 1!! WOOOO OMG U C ANG CHEEKS AND OMG ZUKOO! AHHH i womder if mae is in here
-egQ79OrYCs,@booostie no she mixed they added parts in here.... so pissed
-egQ79OrYCs,how can they cram it all in one movie?? no matter how much i like avatar this movie would suck (even tho i would wanna see it for the sake of it)
-egQ79OrYCs,fuckyeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
-egQ79OrYCs,what happened to zuko's scar
-egQ79OrYCs,"They Americanized it JUST like Dragonball:Evolution D:?!
Oh gosh. PLEASE don't let this be Americanized D:!"
-egQ79OrYCs,wat a heLL.. its really different from the cartoon series..
-egQ79OrYCs,wat a heLL.. its really different from the cartoon series..
-egQ79OrYCs,@EMQisAwesome zuko is dead because they have killed him! curse the people who made the crappy movie 
-egQ79OrYCs,@poon09kamikaze  im wit ya on that one
-egQ79OrYCs,@poon09kamikaze nope i have no hope and i love the show :(
-egQ79OrYCs,@1RougeTBfan  well let me see uh the guy playing zuko isnt hot as the cartoon me and my cousin love him and we are dissapointed
-egQ79OrYCs,seems like Star Wars regurgitated
-egQ79OrYCs,"@khalilahinjapan   no, ur fooling URSELF into beliving that evryone is mean and evil. still, i also agree with u that they screwed up the cast...a LOT!
(by the way, is momo in the movie? I didnt see him.)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@khalilahinjapan    
1. with that logic, evryone shood be asian, because the whole world is in an asian setting.
2. thay just hire whoever plays the part best."
-egQ79OrYCs,"aw , i wanna see the movie (:"
-egQ79OrYCs,why must people talk without knowing how the movie came out you think you can di better do it and shup up the made it like that wait and see it with not dont see and still shup up
-egQ79OrYCs,@spongecakezz  first of all who gives a shit..when casting and filming they dont think about it like that...but once it finished people have to point it out and cause unnecessary buzz..I would to prefer it to be played by the real origin but its not ..oh well move on
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie will fail and i know it just by the actors they picked the way aang acts wow
-egQ79OrYCs,IT COMES OUT jULY DA 1ST ??!!
-egQ79OrYCs,i am sooo excited to c this movie.. my guy made me watch all 3 seasons about a month ago and i was hooked! I hope the personalities of the characters r the same and match the cartoon as much as possible. Im not gonna talk negative about a movie i havent even seen yet.. so i will return after july 1st lol... 
-egQ79OrYCs,@poppincorn92 try looking up Jessica Andres she supposed to be playing suki
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think the action in this movie is gonna be cool, but the characters just seem all wrong! Not just the way they look, but their personalities too. This movie is supposed to be only about an hour and forty minutes. How could they possibly capture all of their personalities in that small amount of time? I have a feeling this is going to be another typical hollywood movie with boring, shallow characters. But that's just my prediction so I guess we'll just haveï»¿ to wait and see"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@spongecakezz ...well, Aang clearly is asian - besides, I think it's a good idea to add ethnicity to the 4 different ""nations"" to be able to distinguish them better. and as we, that saw the anime, already know - there is not so much black and white in the story as it may seem from the trailer, eg. not all firenation characters are ""bad"""
-egQ79OrYCs,well all i have to say is aang is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute ;D
-egQ79OrYCs,@spongecakezz ....Wow you've seen the entire movie to know that?!  Oh wait...you haven't; so shut your mouth and stop trying to find racism in something where there is none.
-egQ79OrYCs,@poppincorn92 dont worry she will cuz she appeared in the 1st season. hopefully they have the whole kyoshi group an have the right clothes lol
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 ok thanks
-egQ79OrYCs,"@animelgirl97 some time in october, just looked at sf.se"
-egQ79OrYCs,i really hope this isnt a failure like dragonball.. :(
-egQ79OrYCs,@animelgirl97 WITCH month..hahahah... its which dude
-egQ79OrYCs,This looks awsome :D x Cant waitt!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,@Deathdragoon799 hell yeah :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"@animelgirl97 In september, i cheeked :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,@animelgirl97 Hope it's same month :P Sweden here too :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@spongecakezz does race really matter? just relax?
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 where? i can only find them on youtube and they're the old ones
-egQ79OrYCs,@poppincorn92 suki is pretty good too. shes gonna be in the movie an i saw a picture of the girl playing her in the kyoshi make up i think she's asian
-egQ79OrYCs,"sry, but that does NOT look like zuko. or sokka. or... any of the characters. the movie also looks too serious to match the cartoon version"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@spongecakezz first of all, how do you know they are all asian when it's a cartoon, the only one who should be considered asian is aang because he's a monk. and it really doesn't matter because it's an american cartoon so obviously there's not gonna be alot of asian casting. And don't worry about the casting, worry about the acting because if the acting sucks then the movie sucks."
-egQ79OrYCs,"In terms of looking like the characters, Cosplayers could and have done a better job. >.>"
-egQ79OrYCs,The avatar looks like he's five.. I mean come on. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Mega174 Lol, the what makes u think the firenation is Chinese, everyone in the cartoon is Caucasian, with an accent..im not asking for a movie straight off the cartoon, but this looks like it didnt get anything  from it either, oh n ang actually looks like hes being played by an 8 year old instead of 12year old."
-egQ79OrYCs,They're gonna make aang act all friggin emo honestly for most of season one he was not this intense. Or maybe it's because they're only showing the fight scenes..I hope that's it.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Mega174 ....this doesnt even look like it was off the cartoon, Ang has friggen prison tats on em, Zuko n uncle cant be indian...thats just retarted, everyone they chose to play each char is horrible.
just cause ang is 12 in the cartoon doesnt mean a 12 year has to play him, they could have done better.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang is like the most powerfull kid the movie
no one can't beat him when he got angry"
-egQ79OrYCs,Have any idea when will this be release in the big screen?
-egQ79OrYCs,i have been heard that they fucked up on the firebending by the firebenders not having fire coming out of their hand but if you look at 1:18 in this trailer you can see that they did not fuck it up.
-egQ79OrYCs,Sokka definitely has to be funny :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"@spongecakezz 
Alternatively you'd have had a white avatar and people would be going on about """"The great white hope coming to safe the poor brown fools?!""
Really there is no way you can do these kind of movies without pissing somebody off. might aswell go all the way."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DiscoPrisco871996 yes, and fighting looks so not real..."
-egQ79OrYCs,@DiscoPrisco871996 They made his scar really shitty also from what I can see.
-egQ79OrYCs,nice
-egQ79OrYCs,@anggoesgrr yea but humor doesnt necessarily have to be cheesy i mean if sokkas sarcasm is taken away it might ruin him cuz he's known for being goofy and serious when the time comes
-egQ79OrYCs,@philfour8 maybe she'll be in the next movie
-egQ79OrYCs,I'll bet anything that that voice at the end is the fortuneteller.
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol
he look slow"
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope is as good as the show!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@anggoesgrr Well thats bullshit. They could atleast try and make him a lil funny, id rather it be cheezy then str8 up drama"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@philfour8 no this is book one, she wasnt in book one"
-egQ79OrYCs,Somethings do not need to be made into movies.

I base it on if I enjoyed it or not and express my opinion on it as loudly as I can! =D Even if you couldnt give a  shit =D. Not directed at you it goes for everybody lol. "
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheStar73  where it dosent come out till thursday in az.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Sokka was casted perfectly, just sayin'"
-egQ79OrYCs,oh! I know this movie is gonna be SWEEEETT!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,They should have gotten Dante Basco to play Zuko.
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 exactly lol PEOPLE THESE DAYS
-egQ79OrYCs,"Dev Patel should've played as Sokka...he looks more like Sokka than Jackson Rathbone. Somehow, him portraying Zuko does not fit. Haha...my opinion. =) "
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol zuko used 2 b the palest out of all the characters now he's the darkest. aang is a 40 yr old man in a little boys body and uncle iroh looks like someone from lord of the rings...sokka and katara,..they look like a couple of kids that live on me street...yay"
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG I""M WATCHING IT "
-egQ79OrYCs,@Lentax yea 95 pounds is fat for a 12-yr-old boy
-egQ79OrYCs,"I am worried about this movie because all the bending in Avatar are based off of real martial arts styles. I do not want to see just water,fire,earth and air action without the art with it. This is one of the reasons i Loved watching the cartoon. If there isn't any martial arts I may die watching it."
-egQ79OrYCs,i am a freaking NERD about the cartoon series! ive seen every freaking episode! but honestly...like people have said...aang better be cute and funny and also what ppl have said...i thought the characters would be a lot hotter actually haha. i mean...i really really really hope they didnt screw it up because i am in love with the series :) haha
-egQ79OrYCs,ahhh man uncle is all wrong 
-egQ79OrYCs,why is does aang look so angry in this movie? he is suppose to be funny
-egQ79OrYCs,Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah are you lessening . no your a boring weirdo. wats with angs tatoo and katara were to start
-egQ79OrYCs,"I know it isn't too much of a stretch to apply these characteristics with colored contacts, make up, and dye or hell, try having the right people actually act as these characters since they will be portrayed throughout the movie extensively. I usually give people the benefit of the doubt however-- I'm a tad disappointed. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm sure many people have already mentioned this, but in Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series, the ethnic races of the different nations have distinct characteristics. I'm not sure why the director allowed for the main antagonist who is clearly from royalty - the Fire nation at that - to be portrayed as dark skinned and short haired. If you actually watch the series, all of the Fire nation have dark hair, and fair skin with gold eyes? "
-egQ79OrYCs,"zuko's scar is gay, they should have made it almost as intense as Batman's two face =/"
-egQ79OrYCs,@KKkidKK appa is in it but idk about momo
-egQ79OrYCs,woooooooo this movie is goin to rock 
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheHLGGhosts i looooooooooooooooooooooooove the series and when i heard they wer comin out with a movie i thought it would be animated but when i found out it wasnt i was pissed.... but this looks great! i just hope it doesnt suuuck
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Demonxman did u not watch the show? He was always in serious fights, but there are going to be times wen they arent going to be fighting, so i just hope hes still a lil goofy kid. And sokka better be funny"
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheHLGGhosts I think the reason he's not 'goofy' in this trailer is because he's in fights that are serious.... 
-egQ79OrYCs,cant wait and mcdonalds has the toys yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie is gonna be awsome, cant wait"
-egQ79OrYCs,why aang and sokka didn't seem like all cheery and fun? aww..i missed the real them already...TT^TT and zuko...i'm speechless...
-egQ79OrYCs,i love watching the animation one and was so excited that the movie going to come out. but just like someone say good movie wrong actor. i thought it was base of a chinese or japanese character.
-egQ79OrYCs,@MrBillySheehan this one is book one not the whole series if they make a second avatar (book 2) then it will have toff

-egQ79OrYCs,not even similar to cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,"im excited for this movie, than Eclipse. The ONLY thing im worried about is the pronounciation of their names. Aang is possibly gonna sound like Aung, and Sokka is probably gonna be like Soeka...i hope this isnt true, but out of all the interviews ive seen and the Japan  trailer, id say they changed their names..."

-egQ79OrYCs,LOOKS AWESOME!

-egQ79OrYCs,"the cast choise is horrific. in fact, the whole thing looks pretty much as idiotic as can be."

Twilight is one of th worst vampire books/movies ever to be made. Sparkly vampires,horrible writeing and acting. Very very dull movie hardly any action or plot."

-egQ79OrYCs,Ive been waiting for this to come out forever....i even watched the cartoon like 5 times already!...all of it!.....if u can chose any kind of bending what would it b?

-egQ79OrYCs,"personally, I think the movie is going to RUIN the anime. -facepalm-"
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks awsome love the sires but if i may ask HOW DID THEY FORGET ABOUT THE SCARE ON ZUKO?!?! COME ON!
-egQ79OrYCs,I think the series is too expansive to be covered in a movie
-egQ79OrYCs,shit
-egQ79OrYCs,anime...talk to anime fans..real anime knowers..this series and movie IS NOT BASED ON ASIAN MATERIAL. IT IS A US Production. ThatÂ´s why most anime fans dontÂ´t see it as an an anime (i donÂ´t give a fuck..itÂ´s a great tv show) but get your damn facts straight before you claim something.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HellaKoolaE 

yes they have..they have drawn from asian arts..and they are well known fopr this.i donÂ´t see a problem there. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HellaKoolaE 

monks are not asian you idiot..not in the fictional (and not even the real) world of avatar. try again. and it is not an anime. you have no idea what you are even talking about little man.
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ehhh in the show Aang is so like go with the flow and loves to have fun...thiss kid is NOTT him :(
but the effectss are INSANEE! i wounder how they did it..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@xxcarlyxx Well, we don't know how the cast will preform yet. Two minutes of footage is hardly enough to make a sound judgment."
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG!!! Why is everyone arguing about the race of the cast. It's not like any of the filmmakers will be on youtube reading the comments of ungrateful people and decide to stop the movie from coming out and recast it and film it all over again. Just be grateful that there are people who would like to entertain you, even though you think that they made the movie crappy because they don't come from the right part of the world."
-egQ79OrYCs,That kid is waaaaaaayy too serious to be Aang
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Sueiza Right. Movie looks good (especially the effects). Cast looks bad, big dissapointment really :/"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i hope this is good bcuz i loved the cartoon, but Aang needs to take a chill pill. btw.... this isn't an anime bcuz its not created in JAPAN owned"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MyWhiteWings No, it's not originally Japanese. I suggest you look it up. The series was created by two American men (Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko), and originally aired on an American network (Nickelodeon).

Therefore, it is not anime. The word ""cartoon"" in the most modern sense refers to animation with little or no story line and humour without drama. Since Avatar is primarily dramatic and humorous storytelling, it's an animated series and not a ""cartoon""."
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko looks gay in this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DallasisaLeo  i do know that , but thaks for the iunformation that might help someone to understand !! and btw  avatar :the last...   is anime since it is originaly japanese but got dubbed !! "

-egQ79OrYCs,Still wish Toph was in it.  =(
-egQ79OrYCs,omg! (jizz)
-egQ79OrYCs,"God damn, Aang is not asian, most people are not asian in the avatar universe, the show just heavily draws from asian art. that is all. and yes it was made in the u.s. and is not even considered to be a real ""anime"". 

And of course the anime is more funny, it must appeal to a younger audience, this will be a more serious approche, and as said in an interview a more realistic approche to the source. 

Stop talking crap if you have no idea and look up official sources if you donÂ´t belive me."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Karskin009 um Aang, the last airbender is asian "
-egQ79OrYCs,@skateboardlyricsgirl Its not an anime
-egQ79OrYCs,if dah mess dis up lke dah did dragonball movie i ma go ham an burn dah theater down 
-egQ79OrYCs,"bad casting and agree with ""mywhitewings""it's called animated series and its nothing like a cartoon for kids.Who knows will this movie do series justice it might be still good even if casting choice is soo bad :>"
-egQ79OrYCs,ok after seeing this trailer you've got to ask. Wheres the asians?
-egQ79OrYCs,"i have watched the series like 5 times through and i know the moovie wont be as good
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"It was originaly gonna be called avatar. but the other avatar movie, the one with blue ppl took the name first."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Katara is hotter as an animation than a real person...
THIS IS BS."
-egQ79OrYCs,hey hey whres dhe chio katara D:<
-egQ79OrYCs,the reason why it doesnt have asians is because its nto an asian anime! creators are these two white dudes
-egQ79OrYCs,What does this world think of Asians ?? THIS cast is supposed to be made of ASIANS!!! This is terrible but the effects r great though
-egQ79OrYCs,"fuck this movie, im not seeing it, it wont ruin the show for me

-egQ79OrYCs,"I'll admit that the movie does look cool. But I hope that this movie isn't successful  when it comes out (although sadly it may). The cartoon was so diverse yet the movie isn't. That's not fair. Even though the movie looks cool, I'm not going to see it because I don't think that it's fair that it isn't diverse."
-egQ79OrYCs,omg i wanna see this so bad!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HeAdBaNgEr3597  I believe their actually making a trilogy of the movie and each movie is representing one season and so this movie will be (from what I've heard/read) about the first season of Avatar, so Toph will be in the second movie and everything with Zuko and Azula will come in later movies too.  "
-egQ79OrYCs,"it's gonna be like clash of the titans, it was shot in 2D but they added the 3D. That's bad filmaking. That's what they did with this movie. boo!! :("
-egQ79OrYCs,"@xxAngelxxBabexx also, just looked at  some tv spots. looks like there is going to be plenty of humor and goofiness from sokka. judge the movie when you see it :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@NihonKitty search: ""The Last Airbender MOMO TV Spot 720p""  theres some evidence :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,@xxAngelxxBabexx try to think about it. the funny stuff always worked for the cartoon. But do you think it could work with the film? I think that m. night's interpretation will be satisfying even if its not true to the cartoon. I honestly think the slap stick elements of the cartoon would just loose out and generate negative reviews. I am really excited to see this film! :)
-egQ79OrYCs,"they ruined Zuko!!! ok maybe i should give the guy a chance but.... :( and Aang and Sokka look really stiff where's the funny childish characters??? 
Hope they don't mess up one of the best anime shows"
-egQ79OrYCs,I never knew Optimus Prime narrated this!
-egQ79OrYCs,"im a huge avatar fan and cant wait 2 see the movie, (me and my friends are gonna see it at like, 1am the day it comes out xD) but it pisses me off how different the movie is from the series. i mean, i know its hard 2 pack it all into a few hours, but so many things are different! for example, earthbending isnt even included in the movie! and i bet they wont show zuko eventually helping aang, or anything bout azula, and of course toph isnt gonna be in it! this movie will either be awesome or suck"
-egQ79OrYCs,@MyWhiteWings lets be honest tho..... its a cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,"Am I the only one watching every preview looking for ANY evidence of Sokka being a goof? 
Like really, that's the ONE thing I want from this movie!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@MyWhiteWings Anime refers to Japanese animation. Avatar: The Last Airbender is an animated series.
-egQ79OrYCs,i love avatar the last airbender i hope the movie is long and awesome-
-egQ79OrYCs,"@jennyvlds cartoon , cartoon , cartoon ....  
god stop saying cartoon . cartoon is like tom & jerry (4 kids) ....   it is called animation !!! anime or animated series !!! not cartoon !!! "
-egQ79OrYCs,this movieis either going to be absolutely shit or absolutely awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,i wonder how they are gonna jam like 60 episodes into 2 hours?
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie is bot to be fuckn live haha
-egQ79OrYCs,zukos scar around his eye needs to be MUCH more prominent.. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think this version is not that good but it will be interesting to see it....but there is one big thing that is difficult:
Aang is having fun with his friends and the cartoon was really nice to watch because of the action AND the jokes and funny things that happend ^_^

But when i see the face of the actor there is no fun....well we will see. I would preffer a movie as a cartoon or so on but well as i said before we will see and we cant change anything (<- thats kind of sad) ^^"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Anyone who believes that they chose white actors based on Prefrence is insane. Have you seen M. night shyamalan? He's the color of a burnt cookie! Did anyone think maybe no alaskan/ native american/asian/tan people tried out for the part? I mean it never says what race they actually are just that they are water tribe nation. I can't wait to see it. I just hope they kept the characters personalities the same, because that's what made them not their skin color."
-egQ79OrYCs,@azula223 wtf there cartoon characters wats wrong with u
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie is gunna be full of action scenes n not much of the other stuff that made the cartoon go on 4 so long & tbh i belive this will not be as good
-egQ79OrYCs,where appa n momo !! 
-egQ79OrYCs,"i hope this movies as good as animation series ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, n i see some resemble this movie n animation ,,,,,wat i heard this movies only show 1st seasons end at the seige of the north .....if this movie ..rock .............i hope i can see the part on second season ........when the zuko become good.....................n ......1 more .....why i din't even see appa n momo "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheAmazingPotHead Everyone's preoccupation with race is exactly why we can't move past it as an issue. This is the last thing you should be looking at if you want to judge the quality of a film (things like acting ability, plot, and pacing are far more relevant). It's hypocritical bullshit; we NEVER see people get up in arms when a white character is depicted by an actor of a different race, but if it's the other way around it's suddenly racist? Please. Spare me."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@xxcarlyxx First off, this wasn't an anime. And second, I think you ( and everyone else, for that matter) should wait until it actually premiers and you've had a chance to see it to judge whether the adaptation is faithful or not. After that, you're entitled to feel how you want to feel about it; I for one, am looking forward to it and am giving Shyamalan the benefit of the doubt."
-egQ79OrYCs,@cooler2812 dude Noah is asian
-egQ79OrYCs,characters suck except Ang cause hes my friends best friend only thing thats good about htis movie is the effects
-egQ79OrYCs,wow ! sort like my idea...huhuhuh
-egQ79OrYCs,so i guess there goin to be lik 3 movie right
-egQ79OrYCs,Hey they have Appa and MOMO in the movie and its the same guy from the anime doing their voice/sounds.. so thats a plus..... 
-egQ79OrYCs,this is gay where the fuck are mah azns stupid ass m night shamylans and his fucking twist
-egQ79OrYCs,If they ruin this movie im going to scream lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"@LevannaRaven well nothing is perfect, you must admit he does sound like him and in my books sounding better is much more better then looking like him and having the wrong voice"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Hope they dont ruin the anime >.<"""
-egQ79OrYCs,i wonder why zokka and katara are white...
-egQ79OrYCs,nice
-egQ79OrYCs,"wooooooooWWWWW Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡Â¡   MY GOD 

IT'S  GREAT  

ESTA PELICULA ES MUY BUENA SIN DUDA DE LAS MEJORES DE LA DECADA SI      

AVATAR ITS DE BEST MOVIE OF WORLD YHEA  Â¡Â¡Â¡ "
-egQ79OrYCs,@xxcarlyxx I really dont want complain but i think i still like the animation series better.
-egQ79OrYCs,@majehwolfe no kiddin none of these are right
-egQ79OrYCs,"@majehwolfe 

can a agree with you about Zuko... but the rest isnt that disturbing...
think it will be great :) ..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Sueiza  if the director is making this movie as an adaption form the anime, it is done very poorly. How ever as an indiviual movie, its pretty good. Not as good as the anime though..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Comparing this to the anime, its a whole lot of bullocks. 
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@majehwolfe You're the kind of person that just ruins it for everyone, bitching and moaning about such petty things when it isn't Zuko's ponytail or the color of the characters' skin that made Avatar such a good cartoon series. Please, stop doing the show a disservice by finding the most inconsequential shit to complain about."
-egQ79OrYCs,"it doesn't matter to me but i guess the hardcore fans give a shit. either way, i can't wait to see this movie. i just hope it's good. "
-egQ79OrYCs,i wish all u mother fuckers would stop bitching about how its not like the 10 year old tv show. who gives a shit.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddh141 7 hours for one season.. wow, I'm curious how they are going to do that with the movie. Ofcourse it won't be detailed, but what i saw, when i saw the animation, in every episode they sad something interesting. But we will see, when the movie is finally in theaters."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ozi is not supposed to make an appearance till later. 
Zuko's scary face is more: ""awwww isn't he cute when he thinks he's scary"" than intense. His scar sucks and he has a ponytail!
Roku's dragon could not talk. 
And even if he could that's NOT what they said to each other when they met at the temple
Aang joined forces with the ocean spirit at the North Pole
AND they're changing the tone of the movie!!! 
WTF Shymalan? How could you ruin a perfectly good story. "
-egQ79OrYCs,man all these comments are like effort tldr...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@poon09kamikaze The animation was made by Americans.  In fact, it was made in the same offices as Spongebob Squarepants.  

Race doesn't matter at all.  They look similar to the characters (except Iroh, but I'll accept that because early viewings show that everyone liked his character in the film).  As long as the story is the same with as much fit in as possible and the acting is good, it will be a fantastic movie.  "
-egQ79OrYCs,"wo wo wo... wait!
I know the manga or anime version, or how you wanna call it, and the're 3 books. so.. Here I only see the story water.. are the're going to be 3 movies of avatar?! 0.o'
Not that I don't like it or something like that, it's just.. no.. never mind! I actually think it's kinds cool that the're going to be more movies of this. I loved avatar on tv! ^^ It kinda reminds me of the good tv programme's we had when I was a kid! You know with the good storyline .. and stuf.. oke.. bye!"
-egQ79OrYCs,I was hoping for this to come. With our advanced technology lately... the effects must be stunning. I'll absolutely go and see! - Unless it's a fail.... but so far it looks good so I think it won't be a fail :3
-egQ79OrYCs,im excited to watch this movie 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Mashimaro0211  and momo??
and appa?
????"
-egQ79OrYCs,"dudes u people did notice how the whole trailer is scened in ice, so obviously its just the first book: water. so i bet there is going to be like 2 maybe 3 sequels to this one , going to be awesome XD"
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope this is not a trilogy..... there shoud be three movies for each book... and sozin's comet should be its own movie :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@Mashimaro0211 i think katara is pretty...
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope there is a second movie :D Id like to see how Toph would look with her awesome Earthbending >:3
-egQ79OrYCs,"zuko is supposed to be asian-ish...not hispanic looking...and katara is supposed to be tan and so is sokka..
whatever im still excited for this movie! =D"
-egQ79OrYCs,i like how they made the arrow tattoo more intracate.
-egQ79OrYCs,@135792183  there is appa its just not on this trailer...Zuko does have a scar when he is putting the helemt on you can see that his left side is burn a bit but its not as Bad looking as the cartoon... and this is Prob BOOK one but the other trailers show other parts that are definitely not PART one... but this isnt like the Cartoon and we cant expect it to be exact...
-egQ79OrYCs,@Mashimaro0211 I swear they better have this in the movie or we're going to have some pissed fans. D<
-egQ79OrYCs,@Mashimaro0211 they decided to make it less kid like and more teen like
-egQ79OrYCs,"Where the hell's my fave lil' blind tomboy, Toph?!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Mashimaro0211 

i think this will be better, now aang wont be a lil bitch and try to run, hell just kick some ass!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@ToFuBomb93 hey i totally agree they have destroyed this show this looks horrible no momo or appa a serious ang what the hell i cant beliee they could do this to avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,hey guys im sorry for this but i think that this is a horrible display of avatar! 1 ang is way to serious he should be lyk funny ot serious and weres zukos scar???i cant believe they could do this to avatar the last airbender
-egQ79OrYCs,@Mashimaro0211 hell yeah we need the real deal 
-egQ79OrYCs,hahahah zuko esta horriblleee!!!   pero a ver qe tal estan los efectos
-egQ79OrYCs,I know nothing of the animated tv show but this really looks good.
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow earth  really is weak.
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow earth  really is weak.
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko has no pony tail. Iroh is ALL messed up. Aangs arrows aren't right. katara and Saka are white. Zuko is brown. and how hard could it be to do zuko's scar right? He looks like someone just punched him in the eye.
-egQ79OrYCs,Awesome movie
-egQ79OrYCs,Since when did Aang had a cross on his back?... Cmon?
-egQ79OrYCs,ok who cares if they dont look like their characters...lol if they can play them right then whats the problem...
-egQ79OrYCs,around the world ..there are a lot of cosplayers better than this actors!! 
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks so diffent and that fire nation dued with the scare
-egQ79OrYCs,Download at   indijanci.forumotion.  com
-egQ79OrYCs,my ex gf is katara...
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheAmazingPotHead such a dick if this movie was racist everyone would be indian like shymalan.
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks so damn young compared to the series
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks so damn young compared to the series
-egQ79OrYCs,u dont know ur color
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheKerut  seems like u dont know ur color
-egQ79OrYCs,well this sucks in the show the water tribe are black but here are white whats up with that?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@iMakeRand0mVids He was more hot later on, in the first two books he was kinda dorky"
-egQ79OrYCs,why did you make zuko not so hot?... i think he's supposed to be sort of hot
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm still wondering why katara and sokka & everybody else in this movie that SHOULDNT be & ARENT white are white...
-egQ79OrYCs,@Mashimaro0211 How the hell can u tell if Aang has funny jokes or Sokka has stupid prnks ect? IT'S A 2 MINUTE TRAILER FOR FUCK'S SAKE!
-egQ79OrYCs,gief names of the songs instead talking bull$hit
-egQ79OrYCs,"WTF.!! FUCK DIZ DAM MOVIE 
THEY LOOK NTHN LIKE THE DAM CARTOON ALL ALL ANY OF THERE FEATURES MATCH DAT'S BULLSHIT.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111"
-egQ79OrYCs,What is the Soundtrack playing in the background after the bell rang
-egQ79OrYCs,"@PKPokemonTrainer Stfu,they were the best auditions. I rather them play the characters then some dopy actors that look more like them but can't act"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wtf man, Zuko should have looked a little bit hotter. O_O"
-egQ79OrYCs,I prefer the cartoon! The real life action looks soooo fake!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ archigos  
i am. i like the humor of aang and sokka. hope it's still in the movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,Is anybody else afraid their going to lose the fun side of the story?  There really isn't any suggestion of Aang's upbeat and lighthearted nature nor of Saka's goofy sense of humor.  I can't help but think the story will be ruined if it's all serious.
-egQ79OrYCs,attention people of earth... we are d representative of Aang planet (well we didnt know exactly wat our planets name really is huhuhu)... we did not recognize any of this asian race coz there is no racial issues in our planet... we recognize ourselves based on our respective nation... the only conflict we must faced is war... so people of earth stop fighting over racial issues and come help us in war against fire nation... huhuhu
-egQ79OrYCs,"It really should hav all asian ppl n the movie, don't kno wathey were thinking there, kind of a common sense thing IMO"
-egQ79OrYCs,0:49 WTF thats not what it looks like!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,@lookheezazn kidding right?
-egQ79OrYCs,how the hell are they gunna summarize the first season. just a question ive been wondering about...
-egQ79OrYCs,"You know, I'm all against the casting, and I think it's totally unfair and offending to asains.... but it looks soooooo good. goddam i hate this shit"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Unlike some people, I actually have faith in this movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,@Dahlgryn he's there
-egQ79OrYCs,"@VoteNinja4President make  sure u watch it ""legally"" online
u know to ""support the company who made it"" wink wink nudge nudge"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@nwsports22 that may be true
but good licence does not a great movie make
eg dragonball evolution"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@VoteNinja4President he acctually has the scar
its right there(takes out microscope)under his eye"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lilboots3962 that maybe true but would it have been so hard to get some black kids
im just saying
plus just because a movie has a good company and producer backing it dont mean its gonna be good
does anyone remmember batman and robin?"
-egQ79OrYCs,imagin how funny they would look without the special effects xD
-egQ79OrYCs,"you all have no clue about how the movie is going to be from a trailer. You obviously wont have a movie with every detail from a show that was on for 3 years, and how is the water tribe supposed to be black seemed like everyone was about the same color and and they were from the north ans south which goes along with an eskimo look, just cause it works with a cartoon look doesnt mean it translates to real action. you'll love it, be thankfull someone wanted to make a movie on a great show we love"
-egQ79OrYCs,"You know, I think this only based on book one, which explains Toph not being in it. "
-egQ79OrYCs,@dinomanj not black more like eskimos and no one is whight there all supposed to be asian
-egQ79OrYCs,@lilboots3962 the water tribes are the only black people in the books
-egQ79OrYCs,i think this movie is way off the avatar books zuko has a scar the water tripes are black not white and Aang has blue markings 
-egQ79OrYCs,@Chihuahuasrule1000 awwwwwwwww :(
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MTM123iPower 
weren`t there only three books?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrJakel111 They're going to make the movie more dramatic and adult than the kid's show, so that's why Aang won't be goofy."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@teachmetofootball PLUS your a fucking idiot! YEA we give them the most money to make their toyotas because we are the ones that keep buying their fucking toyotas, kias, hyundais, mitsubishis, and nissans! thats why GM motors needed a fucking bailout! remember that? one of the top reasons our unemployment is high as fuck and our ecomony hasnt been this bad since the depression? they make so much fuckin money off us its crazy. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@teachmetofootball 

by whites im guessing you mean americans and maybe europe people. china and japan are maybe the most productive countries in the world. notice how all the shit ranging from happy meal toys to TVs, cell, phones, and probably the computor you are using right now are made in either china or japan? as for not being able to fight in the last world war every man woman and child was fighting and we were getting our asses torn up if u look at the ratio untill we dropped the Abomb"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang SHOULD be funny because thats how he was in the show. you cant just change shit.

everything should be the way it was in the show. when you start fucking things around then people start thinkin ""hey wtf?""

katara and sokka looked more tan in the show but it makes sence that they arent tan at all because they lived in an icy cold place. kataras kinda meh cuz in the show she was more attractive.

only thing the actor has in common with aang is hes bald and short."
-egQ79OrYCs,i think its good they made a movie. but they need to get the characters right comon isnt aang goofier i liked the amie version :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"I wanna see this so bad, the comics was amazing! but seriously where the fuck is Appa.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@carlozecobra2 

Like X-Men Origins, wolverine -_-...Gambit's Eyes are NOT fiery red all the time? THAT'S WHY HE'S GAMBIT. lol He was born, they looked at him, freaked out and threw him in the trash because they thought he was some kind of demon child lol how are you going to just take that away and say it's gambit...really? "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Sweet4ddiction 

Well...this time cute little white children heroes save us from angry arab looking people who want to kill us with fiery explosions. Come on, how else should it be? -_-...F*u*k this shit..lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddh141 high five. I know I probably won't wait either :)
Really wanna see it! "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lilboots3962  i agree! not many movies are the same as the books, or original shows!! :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"oh, so kool!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Sweet4ddiction 
-egQ79OrYCs,@Youjen898  haha lol true
-egQ79OrYCs,the reason its not happy happy laugh  bla bla is because this movie is not going to be for little 12 year olds ok? they wanted  the movie to be for the rest of the of the world. guys please grow up and shut the fuck up. i love the show but you guys have to realize that when Hollywood makes movies out of stuff it not always going to be what you expect.  
-egQ79OrYCs,omg katara is butt ugly !! i like the anime better ! LOL
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 oh what a relief. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"wth. the yue scene made her look like she was drowining in a badly lit  swimming pool! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ""MOST SPIRITUAL PLACE"" IN THE NORTHERN WATER TRIBE??!?!!??!?! and wtf her costume makes her look like a freaking witch, poor girl."
-egQ79OrYCs,@Sweet4ddiction DUDE!!!!! i completely agreee
-egQ79OrYCs,cant wait to see this in movie
-egQ79OrYCs,There's NO TOPH!?!?!?!? NUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@shadowknightX1 To me, the movie looks like it's using both book one and fighting Ozai at the same time :/ I really don't think this movie will be turned into a sequel unless it turns into something like Twilight that waists money away for every movie they make. Which is every few months or so.

And like I said before, they could have gotten a better cast and if they make Aang as gloomy as they showed him here then I really, seriously doubt a second one will come out."
-egQ79OrYCs,@Scarpaw1 its a trilogy..?? and this is book 1 equivalent no? so toph wouldn't be in it.. is what i think. Cause i doubt they would make all 3 books into 1 movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,"No Toph? NO TOPH? You CAN'T have an Avatar movie WITHOUT THE TOPH.

 And who the hell is this shitty kid? He dosin't even act like Aang. If they make Aang a emo, gloomy little crap I'm going to be really pissed.

Geez, they could have at least picked a better Zuko."
-egQ79OrYCs,Fookin hell...if you don't like the way they made the movie...THEN DON'T FREAKIN WATCH IT!!! As for me I'll be in the cinema the first day it comes out :P
-egQ79OrYCs,okay....im a BIG fan of avatar........and i was excited bout the movie and still is ..but wats with the  commetns man...who cares.......at least they made the movie......gosh ..but at first i was kinda thing....and stuff bout like why not the real ones stead of those ...but then i changed ..cuz i realised that its justa movie nothin to get angry over with..!just sayin..!
-egQ79OrYCs,yay people that also hate this film. ^__^ 
-egQ79OrYCs,good
-egQ79OrYCs,hehe live action Naruto ftw
-egQ79OrYCs,in the the show the water trib are black but in the movie there are white this is racist hy they have to change and understand this is part one i think cause tough is not there this has to be a part its a long movie it has to be done in part and earth kingdom is the best 
-egQ79OrYCs,"What happend to Zuko's scar!? Why isnt Aang a funny goof ball ?? and isnt Katara and Sokka suppose to be darker?!! the fighting scenes are pretty epic but the characters wtf!!
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@OmniZalaka 
yeah, i think so too.

idk what book it is from but i do know that toph was there when it happened. well, not exactly there, but like, she was introduced then. i think."
-egQ79OrYCs,why does ang look so pissed??
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko and iroh look like terrorists.......and has anyone noticed aang hasnt smiled at all?
-egQ79OrYCs,the cast fail but the special effects r good
-egQ79OrYCs,@only4medani why this was created by [not an asian] and noah is an asian dumb nut
-egQ79OrYCs,me personally i think the kid thats playing ang is a great fit he looks like that the character on the show
-egQ79OrYCs,i'm really upset that all the main characters are white; they SHOULD be asian. But I'm still going to see it -__-
-egQ79OrYCs,"ahh i wanna see this movie!!!!
=]
the henna they did on that kid is awesome!
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this is the first book, toph doesnt come in til the second book (second movie) :D
they said it take about another 2 years to make the second movie...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"first of all... really? dev patel as zuko? he's a great actor from slumdog millionaire and all but, really? zuko? plus, u can barely his scar? and iroh doesn't look like iroh. the casting and the (probably most?) of the costumes does not fit. another thing... aang's tattoo is really really weird... it's an arrowhead with straight lines spreading to his body... not some random tribal characters... and he doesn't have a ""cross"" at his back"
-egQ79OrYCs,"one more comment:
this is worse than the ember island play."
-egQ79OrYCs,@hinatahyuuga10000 guess someone did tell you..quite a few people..
-egQ79OrYCs,@mrchanman39 xD I don't know if someone told u this but this movie is based off Book 1:water....there are going to be 3 movies in the last air bender movie series each based on the 3 books...Toph doesn't show up till Book 2:Earth...xD you have to wait till 2012 for Toph to be in the next movie. :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mrchanman39 
Damn.. you should know that :p"
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks so Failing. Non of the stars look like the character or whatever.
-egQ79OrYCs,@Damronsh hey if u find out tell me ok? I really want to know too
-egQ79OrYCs,@chelia1995 I think that was supposed to be Roku's dragon from the spirit world? but yeah i dont know if that was in book of water or earth.
-egQ79OrYCs,@mrchanman39 well this movie is book one only and there is goling to be three movies so toph wont come out until the secong movie also i heard that its all going to be more serious thats y they made uncle look skinny and scary
-egQ79OrYCs,BOO. WHY are Katara and sokka white people? And WHERE is Zuko's scar? 
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie will be a long one if its gonna put all the information and details which is needed from the show.
-egQ79OrYCs,"YA where is toph, I wonder how long this movie is gonna be it has to to cover all the important informTION AND DEtails of the show....."
-egQ79OrYCs,Toph isn't in this movie they're going by the show so...toph doesn't show up in this movie cause this is based on the water chapter...
-egQ79OrYCs,"i didnt see toph.

i think the movie's altogether, like, it contains the story of all three books, because on the third trailer, aang faced the dragon thingy, wherein on the animation, he faced it on book 2.

not sure though,"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mrchanman39 
toph is at 1:18"
-egQ79OrYCs,Aeng's Child like nature is for 2 reasons. 1 he is still a child and innocent in many ways and 2. I think his childlike attitude and lack of seriousness is actually an accurate way of showing how a child(or adult for that matter)might use humor as a coping mechanism for stressful situations
-egQ79OrYCs,What bothers me about this series(without going too much into detail) is that the Main character spends the entire show developing abilities to defeat the final boss and end the war only to ultimately use a weapon that is ultimately only talked about and mentioned in the final moments of the show.  Its like when harry potter spends all the time collecting the deathly hallows only to not use them to defeat voldemort
-egQ79OrYCs,"@SweetiePieTruc lol...correction, there aren't many FAMOUS asian actors around. Jackie Chan is not the only one out there. >.> How do you think they come up with all of those new Asian Dramas nowadays? -.-   I sense racism...and its not just the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,were is Toph!! :O i want her in this!!!! TT_TT
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ryan97303 that's not racist at all...right well, conversations with ignorant people never go anywhere so I'll end this one with have a nice day jackass:)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Honestly!? 
I don't really care that they made a movie out of AVATAR.its really good show.
HOWEVER! i dont like that theyre not like how the creators originally wanted them. 
btw, I'm not being racist-- the exact same thing that happened to the dragonball movie.
This also completely ruined my image of the characters ESP ZUKO! 
Katara looks pretty- but it doesnt match who he is (kinda >.>)
Sokka-- well it doesnt bother me, how he looks XD
Aang- he's alright
ZUKO--- omg, he looks--eww </3

-egQ79OrYCs,@andru318 i know there not all indian... if they were all indian nobody would wanna watch this movie...nobody cares if there from india or pakistan or iraq (everybody just calls them terriorests)...and when the hell was hispanics in avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ryan97303 
they arent all indian jackass, it's a mix of asian, middle eastern and hispanic"

-egQ79OrYCs,@sleepyaznboi you just might of made a fact there!

"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mrchanman39 

RIGHT! AND OPPA, MOMO, AND AZUELA?"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Guitardude8794 yeah i just started watching the cartoon on netflix....at first i thought the movie looked stupid as hell but now that i started watching the cartoon (thanks to my niece) i cant wait for the movie!
-egQ79OrYCs,@mrchanman39 Toph is in Book 2. This is based on Book 1.
-egQ79OrYCs,@mrchanman39 This movie is soely based ob Book 1. This is the first movie in the planned Trilogy for each of the 3 Seasons. Toph didnt appear until Book 2 so she will be in the next movie :)
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont even want to see it anymore because they arent asian and they arent cute...they dont even look or sound like the characters
-egQ79OrYCs,"@yuvonna No, Toph will not appear until the second film. That is just an earthbender who will likely play the role of Haru, though his name wont be given in the movie most likely"
-egQ79OrYCs,"omg, jackson kisses a creepy girl -grumpy-
a reason to not see it
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@AMERICANDUDEZ ok hey we HEARD you and we dont give a shit ok? WE want to see it so WE dont give a crap if you think you smell ""fishy"" or whatever. "
-egQ79OrYCs,@mrchanman39 i wonder if the person earthbending is toph but she is like...my fav! Next to Aanng of course lol!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"WTF?? i was expecting asians to play it... :( I dislike it...
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ahhh I really hope this works out when i see it. I love the series, Kitara is all wrong, Saka is good, Anng kinda seems younger than i thought, but as long as they follow the story it could be a really kick ass movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@UltimateDBZFan2000 i understand that i really do. i mean in the show even though what you said is true, aang was still the same guy and he didn't change. he matured in the later seasons but he was still the same fun kid ^  ^ and not to mention he has wonderful friends to help him out =)"
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope theres a bit of comedy.......
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think that the problem is that it isn't animated. Because of that it is bound by ""logic"". I think that this will be the falling point of the movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow it looks pretty cool.looks like they are sticking to to book 1.thank god
the last thing we want is another dragon ball type movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,THIS MOVIE IS THE GITE
-egQ79OrYCs,"i want to see momo
"
-egQ79OrYCs,YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No butter fly bending
-egQ79OrYCs,@xChelsz1 Same here
-egQ79OrYCs,its OPTIMUS PRIME SPEAKING!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@letsnotfail 

Don't judge before you've seen the movie.
Also I don't think the appearance is too big of a deal... if these actors can act, that is why they were chosen! 
haha and it's just a movie. If they suck this up we still have the amazing cartoon. Nothing will ever out beat that show!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't think that Aang looks that Asian actually... not that it matters, but people are sorta making a big deal about it.
and I think we need to wait and see how he acts in the movie before deciding too much... I'm optimistic about this movie! "
-egQ79OrYCs,"dude they shouldn't finish the entire Avatar story within one Movie, they should first make Book Water, then maybe a year or 2 l8r they should release Book: Earth.....cuz there are soooo much detail to cover like how Suzko became good and w/e....soo yea....i think it would be better that way"
-egQ79OrYCs,"In my opinion, this movie is only going to be watched by people because it's ATLA
I will be one of those people, however, I will also be one of the many people angsting about the actors."
-egQ79OrYCs,that's zuko?!?! THAT'S ZUKO!!!???!??!??! wow they screwed that up big time!!!! THAT MAKES ME SOOOOOO ANNOYED!! i bet i wont be able to sleep now becuz all i'll picture is that ugly guy dressing up like zuko...
-egQ79OrYCs,"NO!! zuko is supposed to be sexier and where the hell is his scar? and why is he indian? why is aang a baby, why is sokka an adult???? they got a bunch of things mixed around. this sucks. zuko is the best character and they messed him up. oh well, i guess i shouldnt criticize before i see the movie. 
lol these are the just the thoughts running through my head, but i had to write them down!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@xXDarkAngeLalwaysXx he has a slight scar but I agree should have been more like the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,aang does look a little serious. maybe they just showed the serious parts lol. i wanna see what they did with his bison cause i never finished watching the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,@mrchanman39 toph doesnt come till second season this is suppose to be first season
-egQ79OrYCs,@wkkimmy It is a american anime so I think they look fine..
-egQ79OrYCs,@blackchickiedee7 Aang is serious most of the time...
-egQ79OrYCs,dont wanna sound bad or anything but aren't they supposed to be all asian? just like dragon ball z -_-
-egQ79OrYCs,"@blackchickiedee7 Maybe once we see the whole movie, they will show the Aang's sense of humor... It will take away from the movie if they don't."
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko uncle didnt look like from cartoon :/ but the rest is so-so!

-egQ79OrYCs,"where is zuko's scar??? hes not as awesome without it 
"
-egQ79OrYCs,@blackchickiedee7 that most likely because they are trying to grab older audiences as well. Im sure he is still the goofy kid he is in the normal story. This is only a trailer.
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks too serious. aang is childish goofy silly funny fun to be around with and an awesome little dude. it looks like they made him all mad and serious and stoic. i am on the fence about this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"The fire Nation look like Arabs because Arabs have TANNED skin, and FIRE nation has allot of FIRE in them wich make them full of FURY.

We'll see how it works out..

Awful effects!?

I'm not ecpecting this movie to be great but the effects look pretty good to me. Everything that was shown seems in-keeping with the plot of the first series so if we're lucky we'll get an awesome rendition of it with (admit it) quite good effect work.

Chances are it will be awful but I'm slighly more hopeful than I was with the first trailer."
-egQ79OrYCs,@allenivo LOL

-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddh141 You make a good point. Needs to be toned down for more intensity but when I mentioned the director, every last of films before this one is too gloomy to actually entertain the avatar original audience. Most of those who are coming into this film are those who liked the comedy of the cartoon. If you can balance the tone with intense epic action, comic relief and all then you have yourself a good movie for the original fans and for new ones."

-egQ79OrYCs,wow didnt know zuuko was brown?
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm dissapointed with the casting BUT it still looks epic :D I wish they had made zuko's scar a bit more noticeable though -_- and it's kinda cool that they ade some wacky design for aangs arrow.
-egQ79OrYCs,I loved the serie im defently going to watch this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,is this movie the same as the other avatar or are they completely different??
-egQ79OrYCs,the movie looks epic it'll prob have more light to it when we watch it but i'm sorry to say this but the kid they got to play prince zuko is jus plain ugly to the max i mean zuko was atleast attractive.
-egQ79OrYCs,OMFG IT LOOKS FUCKIN SWEET 
-egQ79OrYCs,"stop hating guys
you havent even seen the movie yet. it MIGHT live up to the cartoon but then again...
its a trailer! its supposed to look epic and not like a little happy kiddy movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"The only reason why this movie might be shit is because of the director... he's too gloomy, and the cartoon was more upbeat... this looks too gloomy, yo. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ThEeXpLoItSgUiTaR 

It's there. It's smaller and not so visible that it's anime version, but it's there. watch when he's putting his helmet on, you can see it under its left eye."
-egQ79OrYCs,what is the music at 1:00
-egQ79OrYCs,@TehBlackCheetah what the crap? xD
-egQ79OrYCs,Will they sum the four season into one movie or they r  planning to make 3 more films?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrOmniblast I would think that an adaptation that included MORE races and cultures (Indian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, African, European AND East Asian vs. just East Asian) could be a great interpretation of a great series. M. Night said it might be the most ethnically diverse movie in history."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddh141 Okay. That makes sense, but it will just always bug me, but it won't totally ruin the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HoraceGoodspeed 

Yes, X-Men WAS an Adaptation, but did all the characters look like their animated counterparts? Yes, yes they did, if there were any changes they were small. Storms hair was shorter...so? lol They didn't make her Danish though did they? lol "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrOmniblast The first film adaptation of X-Men was also an interpretation, as was the first screening of ""Gulliver's Travels"" If you want the best example ever, you should see the movie ""Adaptation,"" which is a genius interpretation of ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean.
 Change in adaptation of a story from book or TV to film is essential and practically unavoidable, mandated both by the constraints of time and medium, but how much is always a balance. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@JoeFoShoBro23 It's faint, but it's there. Look closer."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HoraceGoodspeed 

You're missing the point, this is the FIRST big screed adaptation. Ok? The First, that's the big issue here. This isn't even a ""new spin"", because the show itself is pretty new, ok? No one cares if Cinderella is Chinese at this point....but if it were the very first adaptation of Cinderella...it wouldn't sit well with the fans. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrOmniblast ""The Dark Night"" was a new spin on Batman, and the Broadway version of ""The Lion King"" was a phenomenal success. West Side Story, an interpretation of Romeo and Juliet, and 10 Things I Hate About You, an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew, are also both great examples of setting something classic in a new atmosphere. While it is possible to adapt something to film and keep it exactly the same, it can also be great to put a new spin on something."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@changobilly22 I just double checked. He first showed up in ""The King of Omashu"" and then later travels to Ba Sing Se."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HoraceGoodspeed 

There was no need to change anything. Lol, Lord of The Rings did fine 3 movies in a row without such a thing lmao. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"gives me chills
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kutiemeimii 

Lol, Goku isn't Asian...he's an alien <_<. But for Avatar I agree 100%. Avatar should have been packed with people from all over Asia, it's too obvious for us not to be pissed off about -_-, or at least annoyed."
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang looks too serious in this :/ 
-egQ79OrYCs,@ThEeXpLoItSgUiTaR i know right? his burn was practicily his whole story behind his past!
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie looks stupid totally ruined aang looks like a gurl  and i thought they where asians not indians i think the people who who voiced the the cartoon should do the movie
-egQ79OrYCs,Ok can ppl STOP REPLYING TO ME. and GOKU is ASIAN! he's japanese. ahahha XD 
-egQ79OrYCs,they made zuko HAWT!!! cant wait 2 see this
-egQ79OrYCs,But oh gosh they made zuko ugly o_o;  y dont they atleast try nd make the actors look like the actual cartoon? >_> xD.
-egQ79OrYCs,I wanna see this so i can compare it to the cartoon!! :D
-egQ79OrYCs,@kutiemeimii hey smart one.  goku isnt asian.  thats impossible cus hes not from earth. hes a saiyan.
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie going to be coole butt is it in dutch and not english
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@changobilly22 I totally agree. M. Night did say he took out Omashu, where Cabbages man first showed up. He wanted to save most of the Earth Nation stuff for next movie, and make this one focus on the Water Tribes. I will be so happy if his cart gets destroyed in Airbender 2."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kutiemeimii M. Night changed it so everyone was included, not just East Asian cultures. Fire Nation is Indian, Middle Easter, and Mediterranean. Air is like a mix of everything, because they're nomads, and the Water Tribes are Inuit and White people. Earth Nation will be Asian and African, which we won't see a lot until the next movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,All Indian?
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 Also because they attacked during the comet.
-egQ79OrYCs,lame.
-egQ79OrYCs,@changobilly22  i love cabbages man! almost forgot all about him. hahaha!
-egQ79OrYCs,@NanoSpeck Least noticible???? what? they r prolly the second most noticeable besides the FN. !
-egQ79OrYCs,"@phoenixdvt thats ur opinion on how they r supposed to look. M Night made each nation a different race, the EK will be Asian! "
-egQ79OrYCs,@lori123963 the Earth kingdom will be all asia
-egQ79OrYCs,@DarkHari Toph will be Asian along with the rest of the EK.
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 Ahh ok gotcha... Thanks for clearing that up!
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 I thought the airbenders were wiped out because they didn't have an army?
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 could you post thelink? thanks!
-egQ79OrYCs,man aang looks way too serious. needs to be cheerful
-egQ79OrYCs,i wish they'd post clips that shows the funny side of aang.. can't imagine noah ringer being playful and childish.. he seems too intense for a 12 years old!
-egQ79OrYCs,"How come this was an asian show, but there are no asian actors in the whole movie? And 1:07 where the hec is the black eye?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"From how I observed the series, the four nations are based on these cultures:
Fire: China
Water: Inuit/ eskimo
Earth: Korea (Islands like Kyoshi obviously Japanese)
Air: India

But they all follow the Chinese writing system and it's all kinda mixed. It's fair to say that Avatar is kinda AU (Alternate Universe) with all of the strange animals and what not. 

I don't like how Zuko and Iroh look middle eastern...The guy looks too old for Zuko too. (Zuko is 16 )The scar is kinda ridiculous here."
-egQ79OrYCs,iono man aang looks too tense in this trailer. i dont expect much similarities between this is the show beside the storyline anyone else? does look good tho with all them cgs and actions. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"There will probally be 3 movies since this movie is based on book1, and if it is I can't wait to see there take on the great divide, that is my fave episode of book 1"
-egQ79OrYCs,ya i heard that they completly fucked up the characters wit white guys for black guys or something like that 
-egQ79OrYCs,@jcearley69ers actually the world started as brown skinned  and some of them migrated to cooler places with not much sun. Those that migrated slowly evolved into white people due to less sun exposure. so whites came from asians
-egQ79OrYCs,this film actualy looks badass ima be proper annoyed if it turns out like the dragonball film
-egQ79OrYCs,can't wait! i loved the cartoons :D
-egQ79OrYCs,why are they white the kids are supposed to looke chinese and native alskin. leave it to M. night to mess that one up too.
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 Nice to know the least noticeable nation will be Asians.  
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kabloom321 I know India is located in Asia, but its not that type of asian I was looking for >.> you need an asian with the eyes (>""<) plus Zuko is very very pale-skinned.

-The original actor for Zuko was Jesse McCartney, but it didn't work out because of his schedule."
-egQ79OrYCs,"there's nothing racist in this movie. i mean, c'mon guys. this movie took place in a different world and there are no such things as asians, white or black people there and besides, there's nothing wrong with it. firebenders have darker skin, waterbenders are white so on and so forth just like in our world--every race has different skin color. i'm just stating my opinion thanks."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Strange how they don't put us Asian in a single anime movie, but they put a Indian to play Zuko. =| We just aren't cut out for Hollywood :*( "
-egQ79OrYCs,whats the songs?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Come on! Are you kidding me?!

Go back to the drawing board and fix it. Fix it NOW
Please, please don't make this into another Dragon Ball movie. Please, we are begging you"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Sadshadow i understand.. but yet. idk quite disappointed though! wish they let more asians act ^_^

"
-egQ79OrYCs,"hrmmm kinda sucks... cus there's no freaking asians in there! wtf? are we asians just not cool enough? cus for dragon ball z they freaking used a white dude! WTF! Goku is ASIAN not some kinda white guy and the same goes for AVATAR! i mean the trailer looks pretty cool. but WTF? no asians at all?? D:  * not hating * but stating my opinin. thank you.,"
-egQ79OrYCs,@pandafriend69 r u gay this looks sweet ur probly to young to appreciate good film work so i wont blame you
-egQ79OrYCs,@gogiants86 Im doing your mom song (credits to RWJ) 
-egQ79OrYCs,@Guitarhero1119  he's in the movie lol look at the 3rd  movie trailer
-egQ79OrYCs,the trailer is so awesome that i started watching the cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 good good...thanks for the reply. Yeah the nine months to master the elements was a bit short so hopefully they change that
-egQ79OrYCs,I always thought aang could have been a little older...It seems unrealistic that some one so young could take down a character as powerfull as the Firelord imo...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheVVanderingStar not in this trailer, i couldn't comment on the one where he says, ""i do not deserve their praise."" but in it (the official 3rd trailer) he sounds sooo Old, not like the kid he's supposed to be"
-egQ79OrYCs,i like how they stayed very close and true to the series it might be not bad as i thought 
-egQ79OrYCs,"Oh you must not have known about he controversy, sure it was an open casting call, but why ask for majority Caucasians in an Asian themed fantasy storyline. The entire cast was set to be ENTIRELY white until protests took place, that shouldnt have happened in the 1st place, the directors vision clearly wasn't  diversity   "
-egQ79OrYCs,this  is how u make a movie dragon ball z 
-egQ79OrYCs,"part 1? haha I cant wait for Part 2 and 3 ^_^

book 1.... water
book 2 ....earth
book 3 .... fire"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@oceancity8324 he isn't fighting at: 0.43, 0.48, 1.07, 1.23, 1.31. And those are when he looks the angstiest of all. In fact he only looksl ike he's enjoying himself at all when he beating people up. Still I see what you mean; and maybe they just chose the bits where he looked sad and when the film is actually out it'll be 90% aang bouncing around like he's had one too many sherbert fountains. Here's hoping!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@migogo13 The movie better be GODDAMN good then GODDAMNIT!!!!!! 8D
-egQ79OrYCs,@askmeagain43 thats what im sayin..... but i guess we'll see in the movie if he acts like a little kid or not.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TasteLikeSushi that would be a rather funny breaking of the third wall kind of joke that only people from the animated series would get.

so yeah he better be in it so help me god ill find that bastard shamallon if this ain't good"
-egQ79OrYCs,"ang doesn't look 12, HE LOOKS 5"
-egQ79OrYCs,@TasteLikeSushi i ohpw so !!!
-egQ79OrYCs,jeez im pretty sure the guy at 1:07 is zuko's uncle... they shouldn't have made this movie man it just doesn't do justice to the greatest american cartoon ever
-egQ79OrYCs,acting is going to be terrible fight scenes are gonna ok
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang is being played by the retrdest kid ever. that just ruins the whole movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"guys, no matter how bad this movie turns out ( if it does turn out bad) just remember, its not as bad as dragonball evolution ( which kinda was avatar) *cries thinking about it*"
-egQ79OrYCs,"why does aang sound like a 40 yr old man? not cute and endearing. sokka and ketarah..i've grown to accept that they won't be black/native american or whatever you call it, i can get over that. but aang's voice  >_< sitting through the Entire movie listening to him...ugh "
-egQ79OrYCs,@highasahorse86 Agreed.
-egQ79OrYCs,Alright you guys really need to quit this racial profiling see the damn movie first and if your not pleased then rant about it. And to be honest Aang never really looked all that asian to begin with in the cartoon. And you can't deny that the trailer looks pretty promising to the cartoon !!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,@hiperzone i know right 
-egQ79OrYCs,hopefully this movie is as cool as it looks :/
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:22, did this movie really call for a romance scene."
-egQ79OrYCs,"You kids bitch and moan about anything, it's not even out... Instead of whinnying for something that won't change, I would thank  M. Night Shyamalan for giving his efforts and money in making this which was a choice he made himself, because everyone knows The Last Airbender series was the shit. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"amazingggggg
"
-egQ79OrYCs,That dang boy dont even look like he talks.
-egQ79OrYCs,'The last of his kind...will risk everything...to propagate his kind...by fucking all the women...'
-egQ79OrYCs,"What happened to the funny cool kid 
not the serious kid"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Guitarhero1119 The bison will be there
-egQ79OrYCs,In my opinion the people who play sokka and zuko should switch roles...
-egQ79OrYCs,thats so cool
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think this movie will be pretty awesome. At least M Night is being faithful to the source material, not like the idiots who made Dragonball Evolution"
-egQ79OrYCs,"its funny, this is the only time its been politically correct to only use white kids. "
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf zuko is like black and his scar sucks and that better not be his uncle cause hes not fat!
-egQ79OrYCs,They screwed up Katara and Socka so badly . thats awful' -a.k.
-egQ79OrYCs,Is the cabbage man going to be in it? :O
-egQ79OrYCs,"i always love people hating a movie by its trailer like people judge books by its cover.... watrch the damn movie first then complain.
I vcan tell its going to be a good movie, cant wait to see it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Sokka better be funny as hell in this movie...

""I don't think boomerangs coming back, Toph!"" :D "
-egQ79OrYCs,PEOPLE!!!!!!!! the film isnt even out yet give the actors a try atleast see the full film before complaning and as for aang's moodyness its one seen (in a BATTLE) so yea i think he is alowed to be moddy just see the films before complaning
-egQ79OrYCs,"WTF??!!! I want to wath it and all but it's just WAYYYYY off from the anime Zuko's uncles supposed to be fat and old, where did ZUko's scar go? How come Ange is so serious? DANG why are anime movies SOO off from the origonal anime??????"
-egQ79OrYCs,where is AFA???
-egQ79OrYCs,@VampyreCake  yeeeyyyy you're right he HAS the sexy scar :P ... but it could have been bigger :P
-egQ79OrYCs,"@askmeagain43 i know, hes so joyful in the show"
-egQ79OrYCs,"A  CLEAR SLAP IN THE FACE TO ASIANS EVERYWHERE!! Really shows that even in 2010, Hollywood is still oblivious to the existence/appeal and competence of actors of other ethnic backgrounds. Even after massive protest they still kept the 3 main characters a MONK and 2 ESKIMOS to be portrayed by white actors and only replaced a few others with Indian actors..the Fire Nation is clearly Japanese, not Indian.  After Shyamalan's last 3 F**k ups, you'd think he'd try to do something right..."
-egQ79OrYCs,where's appa? and why aang looks so serious O.o? 
-egQ79OrYCs,"The bending looks cool, but the fighting looks fake. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DanieruDesu It's the maximum muscle they can put on without weights and supplements bro.  Chi is nothing, there martial art is a joke because it doesn't need to be a ""Martial"" art it's now just a body mechanics art.  If you introduced weight lifting to them whenever they first started I'm sure it would be different.  MMA kicks everyones ass now and if we needed hand to hand combat skills like back then we would have developed a version comparable in effectiveness to MMA is in the ring."
-egQ79OrYCs,"maaan what the fff!!! there are so many things... aahh...
ok ok ok
so  i was.. well, AM...very excited for the movie to come out cuz i love avatar.. but...
Aang's tattoo!! its supposed o be JUST blue. and then he DOES look boring, ..
i hope its awesome at the end.
i mean, the bending looks preeetty awesome. That, i'll admit. 
but Katara's loopy things! :( 
"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Gamesaresuper i knowww :( 
-egQ79OrYCs,Why did they make Aang all serious like Zuko in the first season. I've never seen him smile in any of the trailers.....
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Gamesaresuper from what i heard, they tried to make the world of avatar more diverse, instead of the all-asian oriented world that is presented in the cartoon. that's supposedly why the different people have different ethnicities. ^^''"
-egQ79OrYCs,@ludatarali0987 You can see it just after 1:03 as he's putting his helmet on. .p.
-egQ79OrYCs,Whatever happened to aang's personality? He looks moody and boring in all the clips.
-egQ79OrYCs,"omg, can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"oh c'mon most of all Aang was supposed to be one little happy dude, but now he has  a poker face O_o and what's with Zuko?! His scar is his identity, but now it's gone and he's arabic - I like that actor, but he has nothing in common with the Zuko character..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DmysteryG the symbols were pretty cool....one thing's for sure, kitara doesnt have her hair loopies....T.T"
-egQ79OrYCs,yay white washed.....god fcking dammit
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think this will be just like in the cartoon, like in some parts you can see that they are in the water tribe city, and there's the girl soka fell in love with. And all that shit, i hope they keep it like that."
-egQ79OrYCs,"What the fuck, not even close to uncle"
-egQ79OrYCs,they fucked up the ethnicities >:(
-egQ79OrYCs,"@existance101 
that kid is not an asian..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

can't wait"
-egQ79OrYCs,"aw, he looks cute. Don't know if I'm really liking who they picked for sokka; this movie looks a lot less humorous than the TV show...but at least it's not a whole bunch of really crappy digital junk like most live-action movies. What, no Toph? She's an important character, too."
-egQ79OrYCs,i think ang and kitara should have bin atleats teenagers but the movie still looks good
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddh141 lol
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope it still hope that they still have funny parts! that was my favorite part of the show!
-egQ79OrYCs,"did u guys see the blue spirit he looks kinda wierd lol
the hair is just not doing it for me"
-egQ79OrYCs,i want this to be exactly based on the movie...that would be epic...like all eppisodes are the same like the monster who if he sees ur expression on ur face u die or something lol...Great movie
-egQ79OrYCs,OMFG i cant wait till this movie comes out. it looks so cool. iv seen all the episode of the cartoon and i just love it so much!!!! can waith
-egQ79OrYCs,tendrian ke aberlo llamado avatar la leyenda de Aang.......... me cago en james cameron
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope they do one movie for every book in the TV series. Make it a trilogy plz!
-egQ79OrYCs,@Balthasarrr its just so much harder to belive with white people in it
-egQ79OrYCs,@CHRISTIANSOLDIER1 . Indians ARE Asians.
-egQ79OrYCs,it's a kid for GOD's sake..i don't knw but i doubt this movie..
-egQ79OrYCs,are there any asians at all in this movie?
-egQ79OrYCs, #OMG
-egQ79OrYCs,"@inustwin123 lol yes D:! He isn't suppose to be the slumdog millionair actor!D: Just watched the Ember Island Players, I love that episode ;D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i was kinda hoping for Zuko to be really attractive. Justin Chon as Zuko, oohh man, that'd be niiiiccceeee... ;D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@allstar2302 The latest Indiana jones failed badly. Yet Hollywood will make a 5th one anyway.

I suspect this will suck anyways because of the director. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@838millionman 

Bad story, have you seen the cartoon. It's a great story. You are probably a fan of rocky 6, the lastest indiana jones, and other terrible movies like that!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@ilovedmseries word yo
-egQ79OrYCs,@Onepiecefan3  AND HANDSOME!!! D*:
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks like another film with too much CGI and bad story.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@inustwin123 Agreed, I don't care about them being asian or not, the show was created by white people anyways, and in most animes race is never a factor, most do not have asians and none asians. Some do like fullmetal alchemist and a couple others. But basically they all look the same.  I'm very depressed with zuko's actor ; ( Zuko's suppose to be strong."
-egQ79OrYCs,omg why did they pick an ugly guy to play zuko!!! D:
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Animefreak7121 ummm? he had tattoos covering his whole bodying in the anime series, arrows on his arms, legs, and head, not just one on his head.
Granted they werent made up of many smaller tattoos, but i think the way the made them in this looks awesome."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ilovedmseries 
blame the twats that said an all asian film would be racist. How can it be racist if its geographically and socially correct. BUNCH OF IDIOTS"
-egQ79OrYCs,toph better be in it :/
-egQ79OrYCs,"asians are the only people that hollywood don't mind replacing
"
-egQ79OrYCs,no asians allowed!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@theanimecrazy 

Blame it on budget... It takes time and money (double money) to get the best..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@typicalus12 

Zutara all the way! "
-egQ79OrYCs,is there still the romance between Katara and Aang??
-egQ79OrYCs,@shadowgoul0 in the beginning
-egQ79OrYCs,laaaaaaame...
-egQ79OrYCs,wait Prince Zuko is Indian and not even a hot indian siiigh AND NOBODYS ASIAN! GAH WTF! im pissed no one looks like their character Aang isnt even uber adorable like in the cartoon omgah i might cry hahaha but yah M Night ChiBLAHBLAH GUY watch the flipping series before making a movie about it GAL!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm going to go see this movie because I love the series, but they could have really chosen better people. When I say that, I mean they could have chosen more asian people because I always thought the Fire nation was Asia because they had the most people."
-egQ79OrYCs,@ilovedmseries  ya the fire nation look hispanic
-egQ79OrYCs,@Animefreak7121 because its too hard to draw a tattoo like in the movie again and again
-egQ79OrYCs,"Oh, great. The main heroes in the movie are blonde, blue-eyed white people and the villains are minority groups. Thanks alot Mr. Shyamalan."
-egQ79OrYCs,Heh they probably didnt put avatar since there was the other avatar...
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks amazing!! i can't wait.  wow i think i'm like the only person who actually prefers the movie to have a stronger element of seriousness.
-egQ79OrYCs,For real!!! They jus killed the show!!! He is suppose to be asian and jus hav a arrow.
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol and the animation version has so much more humor, so this seems really dark"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kels1590 sorry if it sounded like an attack on you. but yeah, its a pretty irksome thing though. theres always gonna be something missing from a movie that the fans want or film makers are stuck on one aspect of the film (ie why ALL video game movies suck). however, the acting world is really large, and sometimes the casting director is not well informed and selects people without regard to how characters look or behave. not making assumptions now, but hope they got it right with this one!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mukmukmukk -continue- Just remember its the guys from the TV show that gave the okay on this movie. He got approval from the guys who brought you this show! Im not saying anything against Asians or whites or other races, but whether people like it or not, you cant always find the right person for the characters in that certain role. If they did that, more than half of the movies would be gone. And they still turn out to be good, not all though ill admit (sorry its long)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mukmukmukk I accept the fact that it wont be perfect, exact, or on the dot to the show! There will be different races in this movie from the trailers ive seen, but it may not be the ones you like. Eventually people get over this, but the SHOW will ALWAYS be the best because its the original. People would critized even if they were Asians! Because there is always going to be SOMETHING else wrong! From the story lines, to the fighting, to the way they act and so on! "
-egQ79OrYCs,"whats with his arrow? 

isnt it just a plain blue arrow 

not same gay tatto one."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kels1590 so your saying its okay to make, i dunno dora the explorer for instance (which is also made in America), a live action film without any latinos in the cast? I think this would NEVER happen. Asian people always get the short end of the stick our of most minorities. always seen in a negative light because of the damn media, and never given a chance to excel in anything better than stereotypical roles (martial artist or nerds/wimps). fuck that shit."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Serioulsy everyone, SHUT UP about how the tatoos arent like the cartoons, or how the people for Katara and Sokka and even Aang arent good, or how there arent any Asians in the movie!! The freaking TV show will ALWAYS be better!! But the show was made by Americans! The tv show has been done for a couple years now, and they have just NOW decided to make it?! Least someone is willing to ball park this movie! Im happy with ALL the characters, just see the movie before making ANY judgment calls! "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ilovedmseries 

same reason why no arabs in Prince of Persia

white people like to pretend to be other races/people.

remember way back when they wear black faces instead of hiring black people for movie/tv ?"
-egQ79OrYCs,@tuuu15 idk if you kno dis ..but if u dont appa does come out in another trailer 
-egQ79OrYCs,I feel offended. I'm Asian and agree with ilovedmseries. WHY ENGLISH FOR ASIAN? FUCKIN RACIST DIRECTOR!
-egQ79OrYCs,@shadowgoul0 Appa in there cant pinpoint him out though :/
-egQ79OrYCs,@TylerSupaflyDurden i think shes fuckin hot lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"boo totaly ruined it
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I cant wait to see this movie.  i have not watched many episodes of Avatar yet, so i do not have much of a basis to be disappointed by if they drastically change the story and plot hahaha, lucky me >.<  "
-egQ79OrYCs,@shadowgoul0 theres another trailer that has appa in it but for only like 2 seconds though. 
-egQ79OrYCs,why is katara ugly?
-egQ79OrYCs,where the hell is Appa? o.O
-egQ79OrYCs,@MammaKittyyy   hahaha i watched that episode last night on netflix!!
-egQ79OrYCs,i think the cast could of done better
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah.. And Zuko ain't hot..
-egQ79OrYCs,AANG DONT LOOK RITE....AND KATARRA IS SUPPOSED TO BE BLACK AND SOCKA.....SMFH MOVIES CHANGE A GOOD SHOW BAD
-egQ79OrYCs,those are not the tattos he had at the tv series he only had an arrow 
-egQ79OrYCs,Who is that angry chinese kid.. He dosen't look like the funny Aang -.-' : D
-egQ79OrYCs,Awesome i cant wait to see it
-egQ79OrYCs,this is fuking good!
-egQ79OrYCs,THEY should have done DRAGONBALL!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Jackson Rathbone is so hott <3
-egQ79OrYCs,Ang is not 7 dumbass... LOL he's much older then that hes 11 or 12 dude. 
-egQ79OrYCs,JACKSON RATHBONE??? maddd... jaspers in it !
-egQ79OrYCs,"@myheavenness Totally agree with you, Anng doesn't look too bad IMO"
-egQ79OrYCs,"katara is WHITE. WTF.
WTF is this FUCKEN SHIT!! This is worst that dragon ball evolution! Saka looks like a junkie, Anng looks like a Justin Bieber and Zuko is not fire lord. His lord of the curries.
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Pretty good. But aang looks to young, and his tatoo should have been painted on, it looks wrong."
-egQ79OrYCs,I love avatar! It's epic!
-egQ79OrYCs,Stop complaining...this is what we have now since the show is OVER. I CANT NOT WAIIIIIT FO THIS TO COME OUT!:P
-egQ79OrYCs,@meximeli7 yeah same i still think it looks pretty awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,"Seriously, does anyone know what the song is called? Or who made the song?"
-egQ79OrYCs,@pjpants12 oh that sounds kinda cool actually
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddyH335 There's no excuse for second rate casting. Like Bleu88 said, take for example Harry Potter. Their actors fit the roles perfectly. You don't see them replacing Cho Chang with a white girl. And besides, I wasn't complaining about the lack of humor. I am fine with everything BUT the actors. Sure, adaptations are fine, but there is a line that should not be crossed, and crossing that line will result in the sort of debate we're having now."
-egQ79OrYCs,Anyone know the name of the song? 
-egQ79OrYCs,@viking977 im pretty sure there going to put each book into its own movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"a man avatar would be dumb weak and fat
 a kid avatar LIKE THE ONE IN THE MOVIE NOT AN ADULT would be smart strong and ACTUALLY IN SHAPE :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,how are they going to fit the entire shows story in two hours? it has a pretty damn big arc.
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks really close to the source material
-egQ79OrYCs,doesn't anyone notice that the effects are a little corny??
-egQ79OrYCs,y are they Americans isn't avatar suppose to be ASIANS *sign* typical racialism by Hollywood
-egQ79OrYCs,"@blackmind981 

Don't get so worked up, they're bots."
-egQ79OrYCs,idc what anyone else says i wanna see tht shit lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm sorry but the anime episodes were so much better. Zuko looks messed up...the scar is totally wrong, and looks puggier, idk... i was much more excited when i first heard it was made than watching this trailer..."
-egQ79OrYCs,dont get offended but the moviie looks totally wrong the charaters are much older but other than that the moves and everything effects are awsome keep it up and i hope it comes out soon
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hope this dosen't offend anyone, it's not meant to. I really like the cartoon, but in my opinion, this movie looks kind stupid and cheesy... =/"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I have no issues with color, even though it would have been nice to stick the race the characters portray.  I just hope they don't make the movie too serious. The series had a light-heart feeling to balance out the seriousness of the war.   The effects look like they are matching up to series effect. I want to see this movie and I hope it keeps the integrity  of the series."
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie will be not funny :( i dont like the sokka and the katara in the trailer they're really not funny :( But the Effects rock...
-egQ79OrYCs,the cast is messed up but it could still be good
-egQ79OrYCs,@kevster789 the cast sucks but maybe if they make it 3 hours long with good acting it could make up for it
-egQ79OrYCs,"aw man, is Sokka gonna be not funny? Because I loved Sokka, he was hilarious in the cartoon!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang has really chubby cheeks lol
"
-egQ79OrYCs,this may actually could be a epic movie xO
-egQ79OrYCs,@BigBis1337 hahahahahaha PEDOPHILE hahahahhahahah xD
-egQ79OrYCs,"this is my favorite show i hope they dont screw it up, from this trailer im very dissapointed with the actors,  they dont look right , they dont fit the descriptions  "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MonakoSM just because it's from nick, it can't be chinese?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddyH335 that's not what i'm saying. I'm all for good quality acting skills, but It would be great if they had the appearance to go with it. "
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah thas right anng's tatoos are not blue
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrsJoJoMcDodd His tattoos are not blue, becaus it doesn't look very beautifull with only blue ^^
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah , i think this is gonna be WAY better than Dragonball live action :D

the only thing that disappoints me is the title, it should be AVATAR, but Cameron stole the shit out of them o_O"
-egQ79OrYCs,@MichikoHayami  Excuse? No one SAID that it was based off of Chinese to be honest I`m sure it was based off of mixed races and I get the part about the names and everything like that but still.... Don`t forget who made the show itself nickelodeon. Its not ALL Chinese so relax take a breather and live with it. 
-egQ79OrYCs,@Toushiro104 agreed!
-egQ79OrYCs,"...their fucking acting better make up for their lack of resemblance to the actual characters in the show. There is a reason why their names are chinese and chinese characters are used and their culture resembles chinese culture and mythology. if it quacks, walks, looks like a fucking duck...

This movie would be much more successful if their choices were accurate."
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko should be a lot paler....
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant wait for this movie to come out! the guy who plays zuko isnt zuko enought. the rest of the characters are fine. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@polaroidplus they must, cuz i'm currently watching the anime and this looks like its based on book 1. but then agan, i have no idea what part the teaser trailer would fit into unless they took scenes from a later movie. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"the thing I'm worried about most is just how well these actors are going to pull off their characters. I don't care if zuko looks more indian than asian, or if aang looks like a little white boy as long as they can act good. "
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope they didnt fuck up aangs attitude ...i hope he still is ...god wat would u call it ...imature
-egQ79OrYCs,@MrPirate93 its is
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't like the characters D: they killed them but it still looks good ;) i will watch!
-egQ79OrYCs,@OmgihtsDanielle  YEAH! I WAS LOOKING FOR HER TOO! 
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks like they're going to make a movie for each book/season.
-egQ79OrYCs,"The Characters have some resemblence... Ang looks pretty much like himself from the show... Zoku is from the movie Slumdog millionaire.. right?? I always thought he was pretty hot inside the show,, god i was hoping for him to be hot in teh movie too!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"ehhh... they should have picked different people.. maybe ones that actually kinda look like the characters from the cartoon but it just no.. just.. no...  ill still probably watch it though, looks pretty awesome! c= BUT WHERES MOMO?!?!?!?! lmao, i swear if they have something weird that looks nothing like momo.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"well....lets see.......they could of at least made the characters look like the ones in the cartoon(because well we all know that the cartoon is WAYYYY better), they could have made the movie a little more like the cartoon, and THEY FORGOT ZUKO'S SCAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ALL IVE SEEN IS THE TRAILER AND I KNOW IT WONT BE AS GOOD AS THE CARTOON!!!! but im still gonna check it out "
-egQ79OrYCs,its probably gonna suck >_<
-egQ79OrYCs,I REALLY hope they don't make this an awful movie! They already did it with Harry Potter! 
-egQ79OrYCs,other than that the movie looks AWESOOOOOOOME
-egQ79OrYCs,ugh... if ur not going to make zuko look right at least give him a pony tail in the movie >:O

-egQ79OrYCs,yo the people look so fake but this movie is gonna be too live O SHT!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,cooL
-egQ79OrYCs,@133spartan117 Momo sucks. It will be in the movie but It sucks.
-egQ79OrYCs,@Luzzg2 what the hell is with you? Aang's arrow is cool.
-egQ79OrYCs,what the hell is with aang's arrow
-egQ79OrYCs,man the should make this movie in cgi not having em played like that crap dragonball z evolution shit movie that shit is just fucking gay
-egQ79OrYCs,This looks like horseshit. none of the characters even look close to the ones in the Tv series 
-egQ79OrYCs,cool!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"urgh no! zuko doesn't look how i imaginedhim, no no NO!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"hhaha
"
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara bodes well... NOT! The actress seems to be delivering her lines in an excruciatingly bored tone!
-egQ79OrYCs,"It will Fail, cartoon version way better"
-egQ79OrYCs,@133spartan117 AGREEED 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lunatikx52 since toph wasint in book 1 shes not in the first movie
but she will be in second movie (if this one is sucesfull )"
-egQ79OrYCs,GOD DAMNIT THEY BETTER HAVE MOMO OR I SWEAR TO GOD IM GONNA...
-egQ79OrYCs,oh man this is gonna be a fail
-egQ79OrYCs,I am annoyed because katara isn't brown skinned how can you have white skinned actorplaying a brown skinned character...it's like if they made toph brown skinned why do that...
-egQ79OrYCs,Will this be a trilogy? It seems likes its only going to the end of season 1 when they find the Northern water tribe. I'm still looking forward to it though.
-egQ79OrYCs,@darkplaya783 That's a shame. I didn't want the series to end. Best I've seen.
-egQ79OrYCs,They just need to extend the animated series.
-egQ79OrYCs,"po q legal o filme do desenho "" avatar "" 
mas eu axo q nao colokaram o nome do filme "" avatar "" pq ja tem um filme com esse nome"
-egQ79OrYCs,I think it was said that they will make this one a type of review of what has happened in the show maybe into the 2nd one there are supposed to be 3 I hope they resolve the thing with Zukos mom and stuff.
-egQ79OrYCs,"the director sucks, his movies are so boring( hopefully this one is not, anyone remember ""the happening"" that was a horrible movie( same guy is doing this one)."
-egQ79OrYCs,THIS MOVIE SHOULDN'T EXIST!
-egQ79OrYCs,THIS MOVIE SHOULDN'T EXIST!

 Indians are Asian..."

-egQ79OrYCs,Is it me or was Prince Zuko the guy from Slumgog Millionaire? Dev Patel?  
-egQ79OrYCs,"well, at least the effects were decent :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"The trailer looks awsome, especially the special effects (the bendings).
I'm looking forward to it ^.^
We just need to hope it wont turn out like the DBZ movie o.o"""
-egQ79OrYCs,so they r trying to put the whole serie in one movie? i rather make a trilogy of it
-egQ79OrYCs,can't wait arghhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,hope it'll be as good as the series..
-egQ79OrYCs,the series are awesome good I hope  the movie  will be good also !!!  
-egQ79OrYCs,looks amazing
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrGameaAddict Excuse me, but that was my opinion based on the trailer. Usually people make a decision on whether or not to see a movie based on the trailer. I've obviously already seen this trailer and then criticized, yet I still don't know if it's worth watching. I mean Eragon is a great book, but my image of it was soiled by Stefen Fangmeier

So in response to your hypocritical judgment of me, I have my own opinions just as you do and I don't appreciate you making things personal. "
-egQ79OrYCs,M.night better not have fucked this series  up. 
-egQ79OrYCs,i gope that there would be some comedy in this movie cause the series is kinda funny :L
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Mendt9 oh he will, did tou see how trashy they made his tats? zuko looks retarded and zukos uncle is younger that he is. completely messed it up."
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow.. They failed at sokka and katara.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Scarlettequeen13579 Oh ok Cool, cant wait to watch it then"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@xxxyeahwatnowxxx
 Agreed, I always pictured the water tribe as Eskimos. :D
It's really weird to see Zuko with a tan. He's like the palest person in the whole show."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Is it...is it really that hard to make characters look like they originally did in the tv show? Zuko was my favorite and now look at him! He's like a completely different person. Good grief. I really, REALLY don't want this movie to suck so...hopefully it's good. 

Dude, anyone else notice how serious Aang looks in every scene? Lighten up, you emo."
-egQ79OrYCs,"You know what sucks? The avatar movie with teh blue people took the font of the last airbender's movie. GODDAM WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE? And what sucks even more is that The Last Airbender will end up on the bad side if they sue for copying because, well, lets face it. It's not that popular."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Its epic, but the bending graphics don't seem as promising..."
-egQ79OrYCs,@jk0745 you are racist
-egQ79OrYCs,"@AquaRevolveR hey don't agree with him, this movie actually seems good, just watch this and then criticize the movie. And from they way you explained your idea you seem like a person who judges right away."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@looking1983 i know right me too.
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddyH335 I knew they probably weren't cramming the whole series into one movie, but they are trying to fit a whole season from what I hear.  I haven't really read that much about it, I don't mean to be a pessimist.  I know M.Night has made some good movies in the past so we'll see.  "
-egQ79OrYCs,@jk0745 fukking racist...!
-egQ79OrYCs,@fizzgigify actually they are going to make 3 of these so hopefully it works
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is going to be like the Eragon movie they made a couple years ago.  They're going to cram too much content into an hour and half, relying on CGI and ""action"" to make it a good movie, while everyone who knows the original sees that the characters are all wrong, they leave out all the important parts and totally mess up just the general feeling and point of the story. 

Unless I'm wrong and it ends up being really good. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"they were origianlly gonna make da cast all white, but some people got pissed and started complaining, so dats y zuko is da guy from slumdog millionair is init. not a massive improment"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i wonder wat appa is going to look like, hope it aint budget like da drgaon ballz movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I Think The Movie Would be Greater Than James Cameron's AVATAR---
Since I Have Seen The Series And The Movie Trailers,I Think the Movie Is Only Till Book-1Water....
And I Wish They Do Others Also -_-"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddyH335 I agree that actors can not be a carbon copy, but come on, katara and zuko PALE????????????? no way. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"As Greenninja said: The actors dont even look close to the cartoon, Katara is PALE, even her bro, also where is Appa??????????? "
-egQ79OrYCs,"@3xterk8 no there is an Appa ^_^ In he newer trailer you can see Appa and Aang flyin g somewhere 8D its pretty freakin epic! And I know this film cant erplace the series, but Im so excited!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"They all look and take on Asian properties
but except the water tribe they're more like a type of Inuit people with the darker skin
and clothing types "
-egQ79OrYCs,@DODWAV  he said hes going to make  more movies
-egQ79OrYCs,@3xterk8  he is in there
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ohhh
No Appa ?? I guess it would be too hard to make something like Appa.
I love Appa in the cartoon series"
-egQ79OrYCs,what is the name of of the song in the trailer? 
-egQ79OrYCs,"he should be chinese not indian. In the show, zuko looks chinese not indian,"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't understand. I read the comics and watched the cartoons. 

I see ASIAN character, and in this movie not one. =O"
-egQ79OrYCs,@skinnymexicanbuddha Oh good lol. That's a great sign hahaha
-egQ79OrYCs,@AquaRevolveR M. NIGHT SHYALAMAN IS MOST CERTAINLY A DOUCHE.
-egQ79OrYCs,@Captain5337 Totally agree. I hate when I love a TV show or Book and some douche comes along and fucks it up with a movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Beautifulovej How on earth is it Nickelodeon's fault when Shyamalan wrote, produced and directed it... you are an ignorant idiot. WTF did you expect when watching a real motion picture rather then a fucking cartoon... 'bad fighting graphics' grow a brain"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Beautifulovej Who in the hell would remotely think they were black. That looks soo accurate
-egQ79OrYCs,"omg, this is soo gay. I thought Katara and her bro where black?
and why dose Ang look so short and akward. I loved the cartoon but I dont wanna ssee the movie because it dosent look like the cartoon people at all. Not to mention bad fighting graphics :B Nick Failed."
-egQ79OrYCs,quicker to produce it please I'm dying of nerves and the desire I have to see it
-egQ79OrYCs,YAY! i love the cartoon <3 
-egQ79OrYCs,An Amazing movie this is going to be.
-egQ79OrYCs,ok well one they took a boat they didnt walk and too he was from an iceberg not underwater and they didnt run away when the ground cracked they sat in the boat and floated away and zuko needs a bigger scar and uncle needs to be fatter and older this movie is a total epic fail if u r gonna make a movie of a cartoon do it right
-egQ79OrYCs,"when is it showing?
"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i heard it will be a trilogy just like the tv show, book chapters, that is why nothing is mentioned about the firelord and etc. Shyamalan always did a good job, i dont think he'll ... it up."
-egQ79OrYCs,doesent look like it will be as good as the show
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think the cartoon is much better than this.
And 1 and a half hour is not so much for the 3 books of avatar.
:D:D
I'm sorry, but my english is not so good.:D:D
"
-egQ79OrYCs,@silpudog80    No worries. They'll do a trilogy ;)
-egQ79OrYCs,"even though it might not look like the cartoon
still doesn't mean its going to be a bad movie !!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"M. Night seriously better not ruin a series this good with a shit movie
I mean he better find a way to make this fuckin epic
I'm not really digging the cast so much, Avatar is funny and this looks really serious"
-egQ79OrYCs,how the hell are they gonna fit a hole 4 seasons of story into 1 and a half hours? it better not be like other fils where its okay we go here do this then go there do that final battle everything s good ..........................................
-egQ79OrYCs,"what the hell is wrong with sokka and katara there like white...  xd
and suko and his uncle look really weird 
Aang never attacks directly... he mostly just jumps around  
and where's Toph?
this is gonna be like al those other failed anime movies like tekken and DB evolution"
-egQ79OrYCs,'OMG THEY DONT HAVE THE RIGHT SKIN COLOR ITS TOTALLY RUINED FOR ME !11!!11!!!' lolwat. Personally I think it looks awesome and I can't wait to see it :)!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hope it would be good, I don't want one of my favourite anime to be ruined!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@LimeFlight Yeah i thought he was younger when i saw him too but i'm just glad he knows martial arts, before he was in this movie haha. the kid is like 14 i think."
-egQ79OrYCs,Dev Patel. :)
-egQ79OrYCs,WDF?!  this look like nothing from the avatar they totlay  ruined it 
-egQ79OrYCs,"big noses
white people
wtf?
bring smaller noses and darker people Â¬Â¬
also
at least this seems more (WAY MORE) like the original cartoon than DBZ movie did. DBZ movie was horrible"
-egQ79OrYCs,i don't see any mexicans in this movie what's up with that? racist!
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope that in the next 2 films they decide to change fire nation characters!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah..so far the only actor I like is Uncle Iroh. At least his voice resembles the character, and he looks a bit like Iroh. Dev Pattel actually looks pretty badass (although I still say they shouldhave got a Korean or  a japanese actor, imagine Jet Li as Zuko) and I might actually enjoy his performance (note, I didn't like Slumdog millionare, but he did give a great performance. Trying to act like a pussy when you're a black belt in martial arts must be pretty hard IMO.)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@digiwitch555 Um he was serious quite alot in the series, and these are only trailers, im sure even this director isnt going to be stupid enuff to make him serious all the time."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Tratsini well the movie hasnt even come out yet so you should hold judgment, i agree the cartoon made me laugh quite alot but who knows maybe m nightshamalan or however the hell you spell his name wont mess up the movie, fingers crossed"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Personally I a very intrigued, interested.  I watched the entire series of the cartoon ersin of Avatar, at least once.  So I a interested in how they will alter things, or how the dialogue and stuff  will go.  
For those whom are going to be talking bad about this movie, should watch it first, then comment on it."
-egQ79OrYCs,i love the anime
-egQ79OrYCs,O MY GOD THIS SUCKS ASS. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks awsome cant wait
"
-egQ79OrYCs,i know some people are pissed that there arent more asian actors in this but think about it they are ment to b different nations. give the film a chance its a different take on avtatar.
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang needs to joke around more, he was never that serious in the original series"
-egQ79OrYCs,"The CG looks good, the actors seem to be okay (cept Katara bugs me a bit). All in all, i think it will turn out alright. Here's hoping."
-egQ79OrYCs,I prefer the anime over the real people. :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow...i like the visual effect's^^..

its very cool^^..i hope that aang should be more funnier^^.."
-egQ79OrYCs,Im so worried that aang is going to be a more serious character in this movie.  He need to be that fun loving Goofball that we all feel in love with in the Cartoon.  
-egQ79OrYCs,aang should smile and make jokes around
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really dig Zuko's scar that...oh wait, he didn't have it.  I feel a large dissapointment comming up this summer, for more reasons then the lack of a scar."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@LimeFlight well the actor himself is actually older than what Aang is (12). I'd give the movie a chance, they almost casted Jesse McCartney as Zuko so when i learned that i was happy with Dev lol. I guess we'll see when the movie comes out :) "
-egQ79OrYCs,Quranjunkie u are my hero people think everything from the cartoon has to be the same
-egQ79OrYCs,"OH.MY.GOSH. I freaking love JAckson Rathbone!! Gosh, he is sooooo freaking hot. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think the one that plays saka (sorry if i spelled his name wrong, i've heard it's like sokka) looks really similar. He's got the right expression. The one who plays aang... i'm sorry. he shoulda been asian. Plus all of avatar's fighting styles are kung fu. I read the kid that plays him is a karate practitioner. Sorry but karate is wayyyy different compared to kung fu. Doesn't have the same fluid movements or anything. Two completely different styles.
"
-egQ79OrYCs,this is movie is gonna be put into parts i can telll cause they have the first 3 episodes in one movie i bet they are gonna make it into parts
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG i can't wait til this comes out, I just found out it's going to be in 3D!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@artsyadvancement agreed, at least it looks like the basic story of it is close to the old series"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I
CAN'T
FUCKING
WAIT
FOR 
THIS
HOLY SHIT"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Where are the blue people?! Isn't this about blue aliens??

HA! Now, you know how it feels!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"you know whats funny in mexico zuko is something like kool aid but with better flavors
"
-egQ79OrYCs,@bunnibi well yea the firebenders are based on the chinese in the cartoon but overall it looks good....and it coulda been worse what if the person who casted dragonball evolution was in charge hell zuko woulda been black lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"At everyone PMSing, i think this wont be that big of a disappointment. Just think, it could be A LOT worse. Look at the dragonball movie for example......"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheBlindBandit47 True, but I'm sort of disappointed. They don't look like the water tribe people at all. They are suppose to be eskimos. I hope I'm right, but they shouldn't be caucasian."
-egQ79OrYCs,"As much as I want to watch this movie, the casting does not stick to the true story, it's like going back to the 20's and 30's when the role is asking for a black person, they just painted the white actors faces with black paint and native americans are played by Italians....next remake of Godzilla is an Alligator from Florida!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"really persians -_- no offense to those who are but if u even watched avatar on nick even once you would know that they're all asian even though the show never says  its obviously implied that they are, i still cant get over the fact that theres barely any asians in this movie, i just hope the movies as good as the show cause for a nick cartoon it was pretty badass"
-egQ79OrYCs,All of you shut the fuck up and just go watch the movie when it comes out. Then jugde.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@baamonster2 seriously i'm 15 and i think the cartoon katara is cute, this katara would be someone a pedophile would be interested in."
-egQ79OrYCs,that gave me chills
-egQ79OrYCs,i just wish the katara girl was more prettier.
-egQ79OrYCs,katara is white and zuko is brown .. mmm last i thought katara was brown and zuko was white?
-egQ79OrYCs,@Vanya12301922 I never said Caucasians are the ones with big eyes. Their eye size isn't any different from races that are non-Asian. Don't try to ignore the issue. Most anime characters don't look Asian.
-egQ79OrYCs,looks lame
-egQ79OrYCs,The actors (not all) are a FAIL but I will still watch it and Soka better be funny as ever ^^
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang's arrow pisses me off, it's so stupid-looking. i don't have much of a problem with how they're all different races to the different nations. Katara is a horrible actor. aang is too serious, and he'd better goof off. appa better be in this, zuko better be hot, or i'm not watching.....and enjoying................"
-egQ79OrYCs,@YougotFacepalm have you seen Japanese animes? 99% of their characters are not Asians mostly Caucasian
-egQ79OrYCs,"so far i only have one complaint about this movie...AANG IS WAY TOO SERIOUS, I MEAN CMON...DID THEY EVEN WATCH THE CARTOONS?. this guy better do some serious smiling/ goofballing or i will be really pissed..."
-egQ79OrYCs,I thought Zuko and his uncle were whiter than katara and her brother. ._.
-egQ79OrYCs,"wdh this movie is not like the real show aangs arrow is a solid light blue arrow not black with little writings on it ,Zukos scar was wayyyyyy bigger and darker than that and he had silky hair and his uncle was short and fat   ,katara and soka were darker than that and where are katara hair loopies,ughhh this movie has so many errors its rediculous i dont even wanna watch it anymore now that i saw the previews my god who was the directors of this movie they need to be fired!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I know the guy who is playing ang, Noah Ringer so none of you better say anything bad about him or the movie!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,The only ones who are similar to the anime/ cartoon is Sokka and Katara!
-egQ79OrYCs,Why is Slum dog millionaire Zuko? And why isn't Aang cute and chipper? I hope this movie doesnt fail too hard. 
-egQ79OrYCs,@YougotFacepalm you didn't miss anything but who said to you the avatar takes place in asia.
-egQ79OrYCs,why the hell do they white *** actors to play asians
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddyH335 I know and people keep complaining about this but they arent copying the cartoons they just based the movie off them. The only thing I dont really like are the tatoos but i guess it would have been really cartoonish if they were like they were in the cartoons
-egQ79OrYCs,@HalfofTear it hav but not so visible
-egQ79OrYCs,Need...song name...can't...go on o_e
-egQ79OrYCs,1: 18 scene. is awesome.
-egQ79OrYCs,Why doesn't Zuko have his scar?
-egQ79OrYCs,"i like this movie because i watch al of the sessions but zuko the actor i dont like
"
-egQ79OrYCs,@P0llyWantACracker um he is supposed to be like only twelve tho! That kid looks exactly like him! 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@burgeruler114  If you know the show and like it, you should feel excited and hopeful that it will not.. If you dont know it- well then shut up, dont watch the movie, and dont tell us what you like to do in private. :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,@burgeruler114 how it looks just like the show but with white people and the visuals are great i think it will be a good movie or it might surpass my expectations its not gunna ruin the show like dragonball movie did
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ everyone on these comments
whats the name of the song? any ideas?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@robin341 yea Indian is Asian but their culture is distinctly different from south asians and west Asians that Avatar shows. The only person in the cartoon that can be considered as Indian is the guru in Book 2.. but then again he could be from  tibet or china. the thing is they chose an Indian for the FIRE nation where people clearly wore china/japanese clothes, had asian based emperors and chinese/japanese names (Ty lee, Zuko, Iroh, May)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@nihilus15 yea the inspiration of the asians... where people wear asian clothes, eat asian stuff and live in asian houses, have asian names and asian symbols...... it's not just an inspiration. Avatar Aang was an Asian Buddhist. and btw, the main drawers of the cartoon were korean and the koreans, chinese and the japanese people helped with incorporating the culture aspect of the cartoon. It was aired in the US, but it was technically made with the help of Asians"
-egQ79OrYCs,@loderian Aang is caucasian. His name is Noah Ringer and he had blond to brownish hair before he shaved it.
-egQ79OrYCs,"the movie looks like it is put together well, but the choice the people playing the characters could've been better. Shouldn't Saka and Katara's skin be a bit darker. And that doesn't look like Zuko. The person for Ang is fine though."
-egQ79OrYCs,"JOVEM TOSCO
/watch?v=IfCLFpq5cuA
/watch?v=IfCLFpq5cuA
/watch?v=IfCLFpq5cuA"
-egQ79OrYCs,damn does anyone know the name of the song.. cuz its sound hott
-egQ79OrYCs,Would it kill them to make the characters look like they do in the cartoon. 
-egQ79OrYCs,@BlahItsEric well Aang was 12 when he was frozen o_o so ya know the kid that is playing him is probably 11 or 12 o_O
-egQ79OrYCs,@BlahItsEric Well Aang was only twelve at the start of the series
-egQ79OrYCs,@Vanya12301922 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<THIS GUY IS THE MAN!!!!! LMAOOOOOOOOOO OH SHIT 
-egQ79OrYCs,"on the part were sokka says""we started a rebellion"" look in the background next to aang and the blurr next to him is momo"
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf! there white in the show there asian ffs... stupid ppl
-egQ79OrYCs,Whoa!!! I'm so damn excited for this one. And it's showing in July. I hope I could see it in my birthday. 
-egQ79OrYCs,they made zuko look like a mongrel.
-egQ79OrYCs,where is her hair loopies 
-egQ79OrYCs,the tattos are light blue arse hole
-egQ79OrYCs,I thought the tatoo's were purple!
-egQ79OrYCs,"usually i am someone who would say that films that adapt their story from a play or novel have artistic freedom as they are their own version or idea of the original.
but i just think this movie is going to piss me off so much. i don't want to see it. although it might just make the original series look that much better because this movie will be so shit."
-egQ79OrYCs,it's avatar: the last airbender. not the last airbender. screw the other avatar! but meh who cares.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@maggie101Dude i think he looks badass you can see his scar
atleast they didn't put red paint on him for his scare if thats what you mean"
-egQ79OrYCs,lol they did fukd up on da charracter tho but who cares fuk it. movie lookz guud.
-egQ79OrYCs,@maggie101monkey  well only one way to know if its a good movie...go see it first before you make up your mind whether or not you hate it
-egQ79OrYCs,i never watched the show but this movie looks cool.
-egQ79OrYCs,"This movie will be great! For all you devoted fans complaining about the cast's, I want you to do something. Take a good look at all the trailers for this film. Think about the changes made to the material. The most significant subject is that little of the main cast is Asian. Now take a deep breath and examine the POS that is Dragonball: Evolution. My fellow Avatar fans, you all must realize how much worse it could actually be. Just thank the movie gods that it won't be as bad as DB:E. "
-egQ79OrYCs,@maggie101monkey  aaaa man a respect what u saying  loved the cartoon i am disapointed as well ..all about making money not caring for the story nts nts shamee
-egQ79OrYCs,@maggie101monkey Who cares! will making him Indian change the story line? NO!
-egQ79OrYCs,Does anyone know what the name of the song or music in this is?
-egQ79OrYCs,@18Lunarockstar true
-egQ79OrYCs,"y is everyone complaining about the race! c'mon it's a movie with human actors nt cartoon characters. yes they could've been more accurate but like how many movies were inspired from book/animation series and it came out totally inaccurate?...my only concern is if the movie protrays the characters pesonalities correctly/has reconizable scenes/and hope that it has a bit of comedy like the show, which i highly doubt cuz it seems waaaaaaaaaay to serious. but it looks like a really good movie=]]"
-egQ79OrYCs,I like the cartoons way way better
-egQ79OrYCs,@rehtaeh77 ok???well all im sayin is dat i think dat da charcters should luk like da characters...im nt sayin theres anythin wrong wit it.....
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ibtubby @ibtubby 

The Earth Kingdom is asian.
The water nation is white
The fire nation is mediterranean.
The air nomads are mixed

Why do you only cares about skin color?

Oh yeah, because you are a racist fag. Man, you foreigners can never see past skin color. That's why this world is so fucked up. It's really sad. No, pathetic would be a better word to describe you."
-egQ79OrYCs,Fuck anyone who bitches about aang being white he's white in the cartoon fuckers!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Main reason probably why the fire nation are indian background because M Night wanted to put his dumbass face into the movie as an easter egg as he does EVERY movie he does.
-egQ79OrYCs,"this looks really disappointing, the director made no attempt  to get actors that resemble the character appearances. Every since the village movie, M night has failed really bad."
-egQ79OrYCs,@ibtubby why is there always the one person that have to bitch about something
-egQ79OrYCs,"I LOVE the last airbender cartoon, the only thing disapointing is that the charachters doesnt really match the discription in the cartoon........... =|"
-egQ79OrYCs,dont spam
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko's skin is even darker as sokka's...>.<
-egQ79OrYCs,"@412830 I think it's going to be 3 movies, one per book. And even if they screwed up the characters, give it a try maybe its quite the good movie. At least I hope so X_x"
-egQ79OrYCs,WTF IS appa and momo?!
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang has a cross on his back???
what??!
damn....its a great show....but the movie is gonna be f up,,,,but....gotta see it first before dissing....."
-egQ79OrYCs," I've seen avatar the last airbender and i think that this movie is probably not gonna be the exact same thing as the show, either way the trailer looks TIGHT. Everybody needs to calm down, yeah so what if zuko is indian? what if he doesnt have a scar? it's better if it's not exactly like the show, or else it's just boring. I think this movie is gonna be a hit, can't wait to see it!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"God im pisssed! when i heard about this i was excited cuz i use to watch the cartoon.... but they screwed up bad! Zuko should be kina hot but asian not friken indian WTF! and aang is ugly here and his ""arrows"" are rong ware the hell sis the cross on his back come from! and katara and Sakka just srnt right kartara should be pretty and at least darker and same 4 sakka except handsome not beautiful lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"wtf was that  cartoon is so much better LET DOWN

"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@dociledemon 
Your right and wrong. Indians are completely separate from Asians. There's reasons why asians are called asians and indians are called indians. where did you go to school? that schools outdated."
-egQ79OrYCs,lmao... they cant find an asian Zuko... :)) and aang is 2 small.. katara looks like a hippie after smoking a weed... lol... 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@maggie101monkey india is in asia,hence indians are asians.Where did you go to school?"
-egQ79OrYCs,@maggie101monkey  india is asia hence indians are asians.....where did you go to school?
-egQ79OrYCs,"HAAAAAAAAAHAHAH WHY ARE YOU SO ANNOYING?
"
-egQ79OrYCs,I sure hope it contains their adventures in all 3 books.
-egQ79OrYCs,Man I hope the fight scenes will be good couse otherwise this will probably suck like hell!
-egQ79OrYCs,the bending action looks too slow... ugh
-egQ79OrYCs,"just posting this at 0:45 thats the northern water tribe wall,behind sokka and katara is gran gran"
-egQ79OrYCs,"For all the haters, its M. Night.  But I can't wait till this comes out.  Just finished the final episode.  AMAZING!!!!   This is suppose to only follow the first book.  It looks like M. Night is keeping with M. Night, but keeping it within the context of the cartoon.  Looks like Nickelodeon kept serious track of the directing.  But question?  What is M. Night's cameo going to be, he has made an appearance in every single movie he's directed."
-egQ79OrYCs,@rehtaeh77 dont misunderstand me yeees i know its an american cartoon but cmon
-egQ79OrYCs,"i wish it release soon
i cant wait to watch it >.<

is there someone who knows how to watch it in full version?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"characters and choreography looks like shit, but the graphics looks decent... the only redeeming factor"
-egQ79OrYCs,OMGSH Warner Brother's confirmed they're making a Bleach Movie! *faints* It better be good its due to come out around 2012 and Ryan Kelley (the guy who plays Ben in live action movie) is going to star as Ichigo rumor has it xD
-egQ79OrYCs,i loved the cartoon one 
-egQ79OrYCs,@18Lunarockstar watch the movie with your eyes closed if you are really that hung up on looks
-egQ79OrYCs,"@vickersfan maybe you need to take a second look at the cartoon before you start ""WTFing"" the movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,@purpletonkadog i agree with you 100% and i actually said something like that almost exactly to someone a little while ago
-egQ79OrYCs,@GiselaMariet123 so your telling me that when you watched the cartoon all you were focusing on was the peoples race and not the story itself? cause that must have been boring. 
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ibtubby oh man im so glad you touched on the points cause we all know that the original cartoon is all about race and cute people and it's totally set in the asia as we know it cause i was just there last week and it was crazy seeing all the airbenders, waterbenders, firebenders, and earthbenders. and let me tell you i sure did poop my pants when i saw a firkkin flying bison. crazy right?"
-egQ79OrYCs,":/ Zuko is indian....? 
Soka isnt hot enuf nd neider is Zuko
Katara shud be pretty but shes ok
Ang looks waaay too yung 

But it still luks pretty savage! 

I Like Eggs And Bread :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf zuko is indian....... epic fail
-egQ79OrYCs,Can't be as bad as the Thor movie coming out. Haha wonder who got that stupid ass idea anyways.  thor sux ass.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ibtubby because itz a movie genious, besides everybody is trying to make money and trust me it can't as bad as the hulk or gay ass thor so, enjoy it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"It's more important that they can act than what they look like. If they act like the characters we know and love than we can overlook appearances, but not if it's the other way around. So, I'm going to wait until I see the movie before I have an opinion about its quality."
-egQ79OrYCs,i will watch this not to support m. night shameshismom. but because i love avatar. :) i just wonder wtf everybody is white!?!
-egQ79OrYCs,"okay, so we have a vampire as sokka, an indian as zuko, a kid with a stick hanging out as aang, and a white girl as katara"
-egQ79OrYCs,well..da movie looks gud n all..but da girl who plays katara doesnt luk like katara or neither does da guy who plays her brother...hopefully it wnt b as bad...
-egQ79OrYCs,"just by the look of this movie, its going to embarrass the animated series. the kid they chose for aang was awful. This movie never should have come out. animated series should never be made into live action films. The only reason the last airbender was made live action was because all producers are money hungry jerks and cant make money off of something original, they have to ruin something that was already successful by trying to improve on it. nightmare on elm street for example. "
-egQ79OrYCs,"interesting. They did an excellent job on making the bending look good. I expected it to be a bit of a cop-out, but i guess it isn't"
-egQ79OrYCs,"why is zuko indian?
Why is aang fugly as. 
Why is Sakka white as?
And why is Katara white and not pretty looking?
M. Night shalamamamamalalan fucked up. "
-egQ79OrYCs,@MammaKittyyy IKR!!! my thoughts exactly :( because he was silly on the tv show :(
-egQ79OrYCs,see this spoof (NO MONEY IS MADE FROM THIS AND NOT SEEKING PROFIT)
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang looks too serious
Sakka is tan colour skin not white
and katara is also a tan colour skin not white

characters dont look so good hope they really relate to the cartoon series and dont make another failure like dragon ball
"
-egQ79OrYCs,I had forgotten Aang's face when he is all worried at the NWT..
-egQ79OrYCs,the actors look horrible.... especially zuko...
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddyH335 well then let's hope that they make a second film
-egQ79OrYCs,yay!!! can't wait!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,where's zuko's scar? avatar forever!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wow, what you see isn't always what you get...guess America will always stay fucked up."
-egQ79OrYCs,cant wait just went and watched about a quarter of the series and i hope i will finish the series before the movie comes out
-egQ79OrYCs,shouldnt katara and saka be like darker skinned?
-egQ79OrYCs,I want to see it because I love the show but I don't like the live-action part. They should have kept it cartoon. My favorite was the fire-benders and I hate how they look in this movie!!! ANd yes Prince Zuko is a hot cartoon and Aang should be happy and goofy not serious like MammaKittyyy said...
-egQ79OrYCs,If Mai and Ty Lee are not in this movie..I will be so mad
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MammaKittyyy  from what ive heard itll still be kinda funny, but all the small tiny joke stuff is what will be taken away. They wanted to be more serious, but hopefully there is some humour in the movie, and i agree, Aang should be more of a little kid, after all he is 12...or 112 lol. Its my favorite show, and im excited about this movie!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"People apparently don't notice how stupidly anime's transfer into live action movies. Name one anime-based live action movie that was successful int he US. None. They did a fine job with this one. Also people saying "" they're not asian waah. "" Guess what. THIS MOVIE WASN'T MADE IN ASIA. It was made in Hollywood. I don't even believe Avatar last airbender is even a actual japanese anime. I think it was all created in the US. It doesn't match the typical japanese style."
-egQ79OrYCs,"the kid resembles to
omy from shaolin showdown"
-egQ79OrYCs,no zuko is played by the guy slumdog millonaire :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"@brooksboy78  in that case aang is not mixed enough lol its like they took the cartoon avatar and threw brand new characters in it, but still a badass movie im going to see it when it comes out"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@koolkidJavon well most movies made out of tv cartoons are very VERY underfunded and directed by amateurs. this one however looks different, much different"
-egQ79OrYCs,"haha good revieuws or not, im verry curious to see this movie.
i love the animated serie xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah really want to watch this movie too
-egQ79OrYCs,"i cant wait to see this movie 
"
-egQ79OrYCs,@koolkidJavon right
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Ashrila i thought it was excellent, can you make it look more realistic? i dont think so.. also, sense when is any one in any position to judge people that are making a movie for the fans? be happy u get a movie instead of a dead end series and stop whining"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@tmntsoccerboy no not his cities temples, go watch the cartoon agian"
-egQ79OrYCs,i think the actor pick was good aang in the cartoon never really gave me and asian vibe any ways 
-egQ79OrYCs,"isnt the dude who plays zuko, fez? off thats 70's show"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@tmntsoccerboy 
that's the western air temple.. the eastern air temple's not upside down."
-egQ79OrYCs,i hate the fact they didn't stick with the rteal races it probably would have been so much bettter but still excited to see how this will turn out. someone has to tell people if it's worth the trip to the movies or not right.
-egQ79OrYCs,THIS GUNNA BE BETTER THAT ALL!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,0:34 um arent the temples supposed to be up side down
-egQ79OrYCs,"@fobbiyo Earthbenders are Asian. Northern Water Tribe is White, Southern is Inuit. Fire Nation is Indian and Airs are mix, in this film. They wanted to spread out the races for the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,@kidcrazyways Katara is white and so is Sokka Aang is a mix. Everyone else is other races.
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant wait to see it in 3-d
-egQ79OrYCs,"I still think making a Avatar film with ""real people"" is a stupid idea. I love avatar but just watching them trying to make bending look good makes me cry. Not going to see it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang is perfect (but could be a little bit older), Katara needs to have tanned skin not white skin (but her acting seems good), Sokka is slightly ok (but he should be tanned), Zuko does not look like an Indian he's asian and should have white skin. I really hate it when movie people ruin everything that you love about a book or a tv show."

-egQ79OrYCs,"@venomous58 
well, that kinda takes the excitement out of the movie, your right, humour is one of avatars most important qualities, why would they ruin that, it would make it 10000 times better"
-egQ79OrYCs,shyamalan better not fuck this movie up like his last ones!
-egQ79OrYCs,"wtf every character is white? rofl why would they do that? first dragon ball z, then street fighter, now avatar! white people r taking over lmao"
-egQ79OrYCs,they fucked uncle Iroh!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,don't expect too much cos I'm sure it's not going to live up to the show. FUCK. Where are the Asians.
-egQ79OrYCs,what date does this movie air in theaters?
-egQ79OrYCs,@CallofDutyguy09  lol!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"this small kid act amazing ,this will be a gr8 movie :D ."
-egQ79OrYCs,yesss
-egQ79OrYCs,"@chrisbaas1 i know its bad-ass, right?! the song's called ""Methodic Doubt- Lonely Dusk"". Easiest way to find it is to look up ""Last Airbender trailer music"" under James Newton Howard."
-egQ79OrYCs,"does anybody know what that music is called that starts at 0.59 minutes?
please answer if you know.
i think the movie is going to be cool, but not as cool as the series."
-egQ79OrYCs,Yes I can't wait esthetically for all the other books to come out too.
-egQ79OrYCs,"omg this mvoie is gonna be great, shame toph aint gonna be in it or azula or ty-lee or mai :( ..... ( since tha movie only covers book 1 :( :(   ) i cant wait for it to come out, i love the series it like one of the best ever, this movie is gonna beeee sick!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,just waiting this movie ... i watched all the seasons the comic ones as i see so far from trailers its really looking great
-egQ79OrYCs,man i gotta see this i seen all of the cartoon one it was good so i no this is gona be really good
-egQ79OrYCs,whats the music that starts at 1.00 minutes?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Dmartin1992 Guess that's true. It's hard to translate the humor into live action and some of it is just plain dumb. Still, it'll be a little too alien for me if it doesn't have some decent amount of humor in it. But blah blah gonna watch it anyway =/"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think M. Night should have done something different for this movie. Maybe a Dark Avatar imprisoned by the Air Nomads with the help of other Benders who viewed the Dark Airbender as a threat to all of them. And inspired Fire Lord Sozin, the origninal, to attack all of the nations. Whatcha think?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"It looks pretty cool, but also way too serious..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"What with Aang's tattoos??? And why did this trailer give me the image of the movie being all ""i'm the LAST OF MY KIND sob sob"" and not humorous at all like the cartoon, which is friggin funny. I'm still going to watch this.."
-egQ79OrYCs,no0d aq0h!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,mmmm >.> i heard sokas not gonna be sarcastic -_-... bummer
-egQ79OrYCs,"great, they totally fucked it up now."
-egQ79OrYCs,yea... im gonna stick with the cartoons...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MeganMorrisFan101 Okay well Sokka is played by Jackson Rathbone, the creepy guy from twilight.... Katara is played by Nicola Peltz... AND YES MOMO AND APPA WILL BE IN THE MOVIE!!!!!! Dee Bradley Baker will be playing their voices (he is the original)"
-egQ79OrYCs,sokka is a joke -.-
-egQ79OrYCs,they got his tattoos all wrong... And Irohs hair is supposed to be white... and Zuko's scar is hardly noticable...
-egQ79OrYCs,"Looks like a good fim, can't wait to see it ^^"
-egQ79OrYCs,looks good..but i dont like the cast...why Saka and Katara is white? im not really racist type..but its a minor changed!!
-egQ79OrYCs,@kingj1992 lmao true....I just felt kinda sorry for the one guy who got thrown into the water.....XD
-egQ79OrYCs,1:37 owned....
-egQ79OrYCs,"i want to point out something what was aangs first line when he got out of the iceberg. ""want to go penguin sledding with me"". in this movie he looks so serious."
-egQ79OrYCs,looks very good
-egQ79OrYCs,aang seems to serious
-egQ79OrYCs,"hahahaha, Anwar...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sukhy2 ...They're,not their,and sokka is actually a middle eastern acotr,if i'm correct,pakistani,it has nothing to do with racism.."
-egQ79OrYCs,@1khong1 appa is in it look at the latest trailer in the very begging and he is flying to the temple in plain view
-egQ79OrYCs,"@shadowmagii The Producers actually said that this movie wont have much humor in it, as they wanna make it more serious, ie they just ruined one of Avatars most important elements......and to put the final nail in the coffin...they made jasper play  sokka.......sigh....."
-egQ79OrYCs,Not one Asian person? WTF?!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I was sceptical when I heard they were making it a movie, but this seems pretty good! The effects, the moves.... can't wait!:D"
-egQ79OrYCs,@shadowmagii  if appa and momo aren't in this - shit's going to go down.
-egQ79OrYCs,"0:37 - 0:39 , that sounds of the Transformers movie's!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"for some reason when that person hits the bell, it reminds me of 2012. :p"
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks kinda wrong, Zuko's a Malay, his uncle is American and Katara is American. I mean if Katara's Malay, it seems more normal(check out her skin tone in the cartoon) and Aang is American(holy!). the movie looks like a flop"
-egQ79OrYCs,@jasminejailbreak ur Dee Dee Dee cuz this isn't James Cameron work
-egQ79OrYCs,"well, i hope they dont make this all serious, i mean in the cartoon aang comes out of the ice ball and says to katara ""will you go penguin sledding with me""
and appa and momo better be in this"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@jasminejailbreak 

A fucking big rock!"
-egQ79OrYCs,woot
-egQ79OrYCs,"Is this the trailer for that movie about blue aliens? I don't see any blue aliens.

HA! Now, you know how it feels!"
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie is gonna suck
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm thinking that maybe there will be 3 movies. i think that would smart. the first movie could be book 1 Water. and then the 2nd one can be book 2 Earth and then book 3 Fire. i think that would be reasonable
-egQ79OrYCs,word..im  officially ready...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@rainbowanimechica 
 The kissing chicks were Sokka and that Moon lady person.... :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,where is the humor!?!?!?!
-egQ79OrYCs,"SOKKA'S FACE WTF? xD 
ZUKU ISN'T HOT ANYMORE ;_; that's probably one of the biggest dissapointments for me. lmfao! xD <3. 
The earth bending looks more like cheap dirt bending. :(  
Who's kissing who? o.o God this..this will be interesting. xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,it gets a 0 out of 5
-egQ79OrYCs,1:27 MATRIX....
-egQ79OrYCs,"@UniverseStar i agree with you, avatar is not the same. cartoons will be the best"
-egQ79OrYCs,I am looking forward to this movie.. but why don't they also have Toph in the movie as well! she is Aaang's eathbending master!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I've been waiting for this movie long time ago,but i think that it is going to be  disappointing  for all  the avatar's fan.I don't see any of the sokka 's jokes or Anng's   sense of humor  .Wow ,it is incredible ,but an excellent cartoon has been fucked up."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@SweetBunny8 
Cosplayers = Pro's
This actor = RtARD"
-egQ79OrYCs,wth is wrong with aang's tattoo?
-egQ79OrYCs,"all looks great except for the leadd!!! damn, really hope this will be great. It has potential all right"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Oh please don't ruin the show, oh please don't ruin Sokka!"
-egQ79OrYCs,that Zuko sucks...what is that indian guy?
-egQ79OrYCs,"The effects look cool and I really like Katara and Sokka despite the fact that they are white. But no matter what I do or how I look at it; I HATE THIS ZUKO! UGH. I freaking hate his ears and he's just so ugly!  And you can't SEE the freaking SCAR! Jeez, cosplayers do a better job than him."
-egQ79OrYCs,@Themousiehouse indian is asian you crackhead
-egQ79OrYCs,"Katara, Sokka and Yue are supposed to be dark skinned.

Iroh isn't supposed to be serious. He's a care-free spirit that loves TEA!

Zuko is supposed to be PALE! Not to mention HOT! C'mon!! 

This series is based on Asian Culture!  Hello?! Has the casting crew ever seen the series? 

WTF is and indian doing playing ZUKO!? I have nothing against Dev Patel. But HELLO?!! ZUKO is supposed to be PALE! And supposed to have an air of ROYALTY! I don't see that here!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well people the way i see it the producers are going to make a chain of movies but some how i think i caught on to the pattern:

First was dragon ball which failed horribly, now is the last airbender which i've seen the trailers and well the only thing i like is the flames from the ships, and i actually have seen trailers for blood plus as a live action movie whcih didn't appel to me what's so ever, so chances are the next anime they are going to screw up next is naruto or bleach!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@ChelseaSmile13 LOL!
-egQ79OrYCs,"WTF, this is crap! They're all white or indian, they're supposed to be flippin Asian! I don't really want watch this shit anymore."
-egQ79OrYCs,Nice...they keep getting caucasians to play in asian roles. Just like dragonball. How would the producers feel if they see asians getting cast in a caucasian role?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Itsnette14 
Correction, americans man. Everyone's nearly an american when there's suppose to be asians DX!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Sokka is a vampire... is there any asian in this movie? (Staff not included)
-egQ79OrYCs,it gets a 0 out of 5
-egQ79OrYCs,i think the effects look good but i might have to be sold of the choice of cast oh well will have to watch it n then decide
-egQ79OrYCs,Why cant they all stop the racism casting and cast all asians just to make everyone happy. lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"This doesn't look as good as the series, considering that here they make Katara a white girl. I guess it'll be worth seeing though..."
-egQ79OrYCs,I cant wait!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"fuck. why must hollywood turn every anime (or in this case posime), and turn it into absolute fanny excrement. First it was Dragonball , and we all know how bad that was. this looks like a massive flop tbh."
-egQ79OrYCs,"they HAVE to put this movie in 4 parts!!!
for the real fans this story is way too overwhelming for just one film
TRULY AMAZING!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is a movie that I will most definately be going to see!  Very cool moves and special effects.

Thumb up for the movie trailer!

(G-Phi)"
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko dont have a scar O.o
-egQ79OrYCs,Nice Special Effects. Horrible mood.
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope this wont be a failure like dragon ball z evolution that movie sucked
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG
This is so awesome"
-egQ79OrYCs,is that Dev Patel as Zuko? im not feeling him for that part :/ the movie better not be a disappointment... id be so bummed.
-egQ79OrYCs,i like the trailer they showed at the theatre's better. also have anyone seen the super 6 trailer yet?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Katara and Zuko look so dumb
the movie better be good"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i heard that in one episode he actually says ""for the greater good"" just to piss of fans of the book they ripped this off of."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think they shouldhave chosen a happier looking kid for ang, and a funnier looking guy for sokka, and angs arrows should be FUCKING BLUE! How hard is it to follow a story atleast a little bit? And ""we staretd a rebellion""??? Fuck that the tv show doesnt have rebellions the world is already in war! Hope all this doesnt ruin the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,@darkfalcon59 there will be i checked online
-egQ79OrYCs,this should be book of water so that means that maybe a second movie will come for book of earth
-egQ79OrYCs,awesome oO so awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,"... i dno maybe they are mostly indian because, it's easier to find indian actors who can speak fluent or understandable english than chinese actors?

i don't mind that much as long as acting is good.
not much hope for aang's acting, it's his first role. but he looks cool so bleh"
-egQ79OrYCs,THIS looks AWESOME! - this is definently going to be better then that pile of shit dragonball...i had more joy watching this trailer then the whole damn dragonball movie!!
-egQ79OrYCs,sigh it REALLY seem awkward to have non asains play in this movie i simply LOVE avatar but i don't have high hopes for this.
-egQ79OrYCs,at least the fire nations asian lol indian is asian but im going to see this movie shit or not i love avater and i hope that sokka is really sarcastic and not serouis thats gonna piss me teh fuck off
-egQ79OrYCs,cant stand the cast
-egQ79OrYCs,the new trailer is soooooooooooooooooooooooo much better
-egQ79OrYCs,"god this looks like its going to suck the actors dont look right
there trying to go over an entire season in one movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,they could have chosen some actors that look like the characters..
-egQ79OrYCs,well this looks like a shit movie
-egQ79OrYCs,Where are abba and momo? X'(
-egQ79OrYCs,"This movie looks great for the action the only thing im afraid of is the lack of humour from the previews. But I have to give it to M. Night, he knows how to sell a movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@emily0browning 
I beleive the movie is of the first season only. So no Toph yet."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I love that M. Shyamalan put his name so damn big on this movie. It was like putting giant arrows on whom fans should direct their hate at the EXTREMELY SHITTY casting decisions. I have nothing against the actors/actresses in this movie, but they ruined the cultural homage the original series paid to Asia. Way to go forwarding the stereotypes of Hollywood Shymalan, you big jerk."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Honestly... the actors should be Asian.
I have a feeling this movie won't follow the origional story.

I really hope Mr. Shyamalan doesn't ruin it."
-egQ79OrYCs,@blackember19 what ever.
-egQ79OrYCs,@rafa5553 i agee looks matter but not a lot but its if he can portray zuko character thats good
-egQ79OrYCs,"well yea dbz was crap but so was the trailer in my opinion...this on the other hand this does look some what amusing and something worth checking out i guess, nothing else coming out in cinema xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,BUTCHERED! PURE BUTCHERED! the fire lords son is supposed to be SHUNNED! if you dont know what that means it meant kicked out! xD
-egQ79OrYCs,dat iish cold bro  . !   Yeah!
-egQ79OrYCs,@IvIaxxie Agree completely. That dragonball movie was a joke. Hope they don't murder this series as well.
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah, but i could have done a way better katara, i am her skin colour, and look alot like her, and also, i am alot like her personality too. i absalutely love the water, and have an affinity with it, thanks"
-egQ79OrYCs,@cynnGAH so true about asians being paler.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@IvIaxxie I totally agree with you, that Dragon Ball movie really dissapointed me.. But Avatar The Last Airbender looks soooo much better!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"hmm this looks pretty good actually, not like the dragon ball z movie wich was crap 
-_-"
-egQ79OrYCs,They could have just gotten some mexicans to play them inuit peeps man. problem solved... even though they probably wouldnt show it in Arizona then
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Eldrad235 Aang is supposed to look like a kid, He is twelve. Zuko has a scar, its just smaller that in the cartoon, look closer."
-egQ79OrYCs,"the actor for ang looks too much like a kid .... Zuko doesn't have a scar
and they are taking everything from the original episodes and make them into a movie
in short they didn't try to come up with anything new"
-egQ79OrYCs,"they should've made this..it fucks up my view of the show
zuko looks NOTHING like he does on the show
movie looks stupid"
-egQ79OrYCs,A BLOODY INDIAN FOR PRINCE ZUKO WTF
-egQ79OrYCs,haha this aint gonna go well
-egQ79OrYCs,@grecycakes I never gave the color of the character much thought.  Plus Suko in the cartoon series is not that white.  Unless of course you meant to say Sakka and not Suko.  Sakka is really white but suko not so much.  This movie looks amazing!
-egQ79OrYCs,@imafreakingninjaa i feel the same....
-egQ79OrYCs,omfg ! i hate the director! he cagged up my fav character !!! !suko is fuking indiian? wtf.!!! hes fukin witer then edward cullen in the show for crying out loud!
-egQ79OrYCs,Hmm....will I risk completely hating avatar?
-egQ79OrYCs,@Th3SP1C ikr! saka better nail his 2! saka makes that show!
-egQ79OrYCs,his tats are awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie better not ruin the show tho or im gonna scream
-egQ79OrYCs,AVATAR W00T W00T Looks a little cheesy (the airbending) but I DONT CARE IM GONNA SEE MY FAVORITE TV SHOW OF ALL TIME :DDDD.
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks awsome! just like the episodes!!
-egQ79OrYCs,not sure it was on TV but dont worry appa looks exaclty like on the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,@Th3SP1C which trailer?
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope this a trilogy sine they probally fousing on the first couple of episodes and the last two i dont like who is playing zuko he better nail that role
-egQ79OrYCs,@deathchrno hes in a another trailer
-egQ79OrYCs,where is appa?
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf? Avatar is turkish???
-egQ79OrYCs,"Looks like on of the ""bollywood"" movies -.-"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@cynnGAH 

Easy my friend.  In DBZ they were all very pale asians so it there wasn't any real difference in making the actors white.  Actually the only one i thought looked asian in the cartoon was Chi-Chi."
-egQ79OrYCs,look much better than the first trailer.  and most characters are acceptable.  however aangs actor is still a let down particularly with the tatoo when not in avatar state.  although its brilliant in the avatar state.  i'll actually go see it now based off this trailer.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@deadlywon come on, ask your fellow americans and most of them would agree race-bending is everywhere in hollywood. you're in denial."
-egQ79OrYCs,@cynnGAH Actually in the cartoon they are all Asian
-egQ79OrYCs,Is this much whitewashing considered some form of prejudice.
-egQ79OrYCs,"all i got to say is ""OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"""
-egQ79OrYCs,I think that they should make more movies with more details... they will get more money and we (the fans) will become more satisfied.
-egQ79OrYCs,"not sure how I feel about this... the quality of the action like water bending looks good, but the acters don't have the same ""feel"" as the original characters. plus it'll be hard to put an entire cartoon series into one movie, live action or not.
I'm going to see it, of course! I'm just not terribly excited... :\
well, here's hoping it's good! ^-^;"
-egQ79OrYCs,I was kind of put out with the cast and director when it was first announced but I have to say this actually looks pretty fucking good..
-egQ79OrYCs,"shit, 1:35 gave me the shivers. :o"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@deadlywon Sorry I said it wrong. I mean asian-type characters, eg. Chun Li. She's definitely chinese yet Hollywood picked a white woman to play her. Now if you ask 100 people what race Aang is based on his portrayal in the tv series, I bet 99, if not 100, of them will answer he's chinese or at least east asian. But of course all main characters must be white in Hollywood movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@deadlywon Well anyone would agree the casting is crap and Hollywood has been racist in many asian-themed movies. Examples? Street Fighter, Tekken and now Avatar. You can't disagree there's race-bending unless you're racist too."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Suzette1122 Lol ya, that's because in the TV series, it was for children and I'm guessing the director was aiming for a more action packed vibe - to attract the viewers."
-egQ79OrYCs,Right...whats with the movie shoudnt this people be like aa...chinese or something...
-egQ79OrYCs,"somehow, the movie's plot seems darker compared to the series where aang and sokka were more happy-go-lucky and funny but they seem so serious in the movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,dav patel a.k.a. jamal from slumdog millianer
-egQ79OrYCs,WHERE IS MY EARTH BIT*H?
-egQ79OrYCs,i really hope this movie doesn't fail. i don't want a repeat of the dragon ball movie >.>
-egQ79OrYCs,FINNALY!!!!!!!!!!!!! there making a movie!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@AkatsukiMuffin492 well he has to become scarred before he can get it, probably will happen in the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,@angelazrail lol i no and i love the cartoon and the special effects dont look as good as i hoped....but you never no...CANT WAIT
-egQ79OrYCs,i love u jamal.. hahahahahahah. :))
-egQ79OrYCs,name of song?
-egQ79OrYCs,yea right we all need him i take my vacuum cleaner and suck him in
-egQ79OrYCs,@soragirl6 Yeah so? Zuko is bald except for a ponytail in book 1. But then again the cast is fucked up so it won't matter.
-egQ79OrYCs,where the fuck is zukos scar >:I
-egQ79OrYCs,@smjop121 Thus I said the cast is crap.
-egQ79OrYCs,appa is on the 4th trailer
-egQ79OrYCs,The cast is crap but they seem to have decent acting skills. Hollywood is still racist though.
-egQ79OrYCs,"CROSS on Aang's back?? W T F !?!?!?!?
It's supposed to be a continued arrow to represent the flow of chi!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Wait so Zukko has long hair from book1? Wtf?
-egQ79OrYCs,"The casting was a mega fail, but the film looks cool...especially the dude from slumdog millionair, plus zuko's scar was alot flippin worse"
-egQ79OrYCs,@lily4562 I think it might be a trilogy. I could be wrong tho
-egQ79OrYCs,"the movie looks awesome, but they chose terrible actors for the roles"
-egQ79OrYCs,its gonna be desent they probley gonna make three parts like the actuall tv sires
-egQ79OrYCs,how are they gonna pul of a 8 yr tv series in one movie ???
-egQ79OrYCs,y is katara and sokka white
-egQ79OrYCs,katara isnt as pretty as the cartoon katara
-egQ79OrYCs,y does this seem like dragonball evolution all over again?
-egQ79OrYCs,the trailer looks good................i hope it dosent FAIL!!!! like that peice of shit dragon ball eveloution movie last year
-egQ79OrYCs,"the movie looks like book 1 of the cartoon\
yeah i wish katara and saka were darker i think they made ang and zuko kind of right but zuko should be a little buffer (NO HOMO) and zukos uncle looks mean"
-egQ79OrYCs,fuck yeah i cant wait im totally geekn right now !!!!......
-egQ79OrYCs,waiting for this!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Is that Sokka and Suki kissing?
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont think tha the movie is going to suck. You can see that the makers made an effort for at least look like the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,@wolfhearttx no she is in the next movie its a trilogy
-egQ79OrYCs,"dude katara looks like shit, or atleast looks like shes been raped more than once"
-egQ79OrYCs,I am seriously dissapointed by the trailer. >:|
-egQ79OrYCs,better than DBE and I can tell it is Avatar TLAB
-egQ79OrYCs,uhm..avatar looks kinda chubby and..i was hoping he'd be more...a comedian like in the cartoon and uhm the girl is hot lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"@NoTing56 or, it's just a badass cartoon with asian influences in art and setting."
-egQ79OrYCs,@b00m667 Agreed.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@np9490 look closer at 1:04, he HAS a scar above his left eye..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@np9490 I agree, this doesn't look like it's supposed to. However, I think it's going to be very funny! P.S. You spelled Zuko wrong. :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,please let this do the anime justice if it doesn't we can say goodbye to the avatar universe.
-egQ79OrYCs,probally going to see this in 3D the special effects look nice!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wooow, it looks awesome."
-egQ79OrYCs,"wtf zukoooo
looool :D :D :D 
looks like some muslim guy :x"
-egQ79OrYCs,"finally, I been wanting to kick the other Avatar by James Cameron in the ass. this movie should do just fine."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I am soooo excited for this movie! I am a huge fan of this cartoon and everyone that is complaining about the characters not looking right and blahblahblah HELLO it's based off a damn cartoon no one is going to look exactly right! Look at books made into movies, those characters never look like they're supposed to so get over it! I am excited that M Knight Shamylan can't put one of his stupid twists on this movie though! lol=)~"
-egQ79OrYCs,THE GIRL IS UGLY JUST SAYING :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@LoveMyKruePup july 2nd
-egQ79OrYCs,CANT WAIT
-egQ79OrYCs,@sashayermolaev haha yeah i wanna see what toph looks like
-egQ79OrYCs,@troubleshooter12z 0_0 ide tap her
-egQ79OrYCs,does anyone know the music in this?
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think katara looks cool, who plays her character?"
-egQ79OrYCs,WHEN IS THIS IN THEATERS
-egQ79OrYCs,@troubleshooter12z does your girl look better?
-egQ79OrYCs,"what?!! katara is gorgeous! Also Zuko! very hot!
aang is just the same! zuko and iroh is a disapoitment! zuko supose to be hot! and have a bold hair and iroh supose to be fat and look cute not mean.

i hope toph will be the same in the movie as she is in the cartoon

cant wait to see it!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,oh dear if this is the cast so far id hate to see toph and that uncle person xD
-egQ79OrYCs,@Romancelover8 The Persian Empire is no longer around but Iran is pretty much the successor. That still does not answer why this movie must be singled out for having authentic cast members when movies that depict historical events like Kingdom of Heaven do not and there is no outcry
-egQ79OrYCs,Of course look at Ang.  She has to kiss him lol!
-egQ79OrYCs,i agree but u guys should give it a chance hes not gonna get every charactor perfect its an animated tv show for gods sake the characters are fictional!!!!! Anyways i have high hopes for this movie. look forward to watchin it .
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang is kinda fat, kataras and sokkas skin is too bright and kataras face?! and her hair. i could cry q.q zuko is just ugly and without a scar indead of hot and with a real scar. and ozai doesnt look very impressing.
okay, eartbending and firebending was cool, but the characters?!
and yue is in there, so I hope suki will be, too"
-egQ79OrYCs,awsome!
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG, why is everyone ranting about the cast?? It's a fantasy world NOT Earth. They don't need to be Asian. Why nobody complains there were no Greek actors in Clash of the Titans? Why nobody complains the lead actors for Prince of Persia are not Persian?? Why idiots complain about Avatar?? Greece and Persia are real places, not the Fire Nation or Water Tribe. Get over your hypocrisy."
-egQ79OrYCs,"tis guy doesn't noe how 2 use the staff.......and the tatoos r ugly,i prefer the cartoon"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@caseyboy97  anime is japanese animation. this would just be considered animation or a cartoon, for it is american"
-egQ79OrYCs,"im going to keep my expectations low, so if i get disappointed, i wont want hurt the director"
-egQ79OrYCs,This is my fav anime of all time. next is dbz
-egQ79OrYCs,I believe there doing this in three parts like the books
-egQ79OrYCs,@SpazFactorial Thanks alot for the info Spaz! thats good to know hopefully it works out well and we get all 4 so I can guy the set ;)
-egQ79OrYCs,@mrbigdom88 and where is Suki and the other warriors?
-egQ79OrYCs,"should have made it a 2 or 3 part movie because the story is so epic , and was that guy supposed to be Uncle Iroh? way to young and not fat/jolly enough , looks like they too all the anime out of it and tried to be too hard core and what about momo , ill still see it though maybe it will rock"
-egQ79OrYCs,"is prince zuko the guy from slumdog miliionaire???! oh, wow, I'm gonna be thinking, where's latika the entire movie. fml. other than that, so pumped. devoted fan of the Niceklodeon series, cant wait"
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope that they choose someone like Chloe Moretz for Toph she is cool..I was thinking about it whilst watching Kickass.. hmm
-egQ79OrYCs,"@bowlsocereal 
it better be long as hell !! im really hoping it is because if it is standard hour and a half kinda movie imma be hella pissed lol... they need plenty of time to flesh out the story line.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"true that... concept.... aang should still have a little more chlid playfullness to him.... hopefully the scenes they didn't show will have some of that..... and if they are covering the whole first book, the movie should be like 3 hours long if they are gonna even cover half the stuff in the series."
-egQ79OrYCs,"the thing i am most disappointed about is prolly Uncle Iroh isn't the fair skinned, fat, and wisdom filled looking man that he is in the series.... at least i think the guy firebending with both hands was him..... maybe it was zhao..... oh well.... just because the looks of things are different doesn't mean that it wont have awesomeness of its own."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Let's see they massed up Tekken and Dragon ball and now there massing up this one! dame you Hollywood get some Asia people in it! they look nothing alike! 
I was so looking forward to this movie to..."
-egQ79OrYCs,i think all the main characters could be a little older... they re too young...
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think the movie is really great. But we only have problems with the casts. Aang looks so serious here while in the cartoon he's so playful. I'm mad because Katara   & Sokka are WHITE! But I do think that Sokka is hot. He's hotter than Zuko in here. But in the cartoon I really like Zuko especially during the last episode where his hair is not ponytailed. His scar is not so bold, I almost can't see them. I was hoping that Toph is here but this is book 1 and she'll probably appear in Book 2."
-egQ79OrYCs,"What genius decided to give this movie to M. Night Shyamalan. Watch as another director attempts to immortalize himself by ""breaking the mould"". Gimme a friggin' break, there could not have been more brilliant material to work with already. Seems redundant to criticize specifics, so rather I'll just say that the water bending looks sweet."
-egQ79OrYCs,@WHOWHAT13 the show was written by americans  anyway
-egQ79OrYCs,Well they aren't perfect y' know. :/ they can't do EVERYTHING. Even though there are some mistakes in the movie I'm still gonna watch it. Because it's awesome. :P
-egQ79OrYCs,i fear that the costumes look too much like costumes... especially in the third trailer..ugh god help this movie or else ill blood bend the blood right out of me...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HelloKittyCellphone 
the director actually said that he was going to remove most of the humor from the movie ... which i though was a good idea.. it wouldnt translate well into live action.. i think less humor makes it more epic and less of a kids show.."
-egQ79OrYCs,katara in this movie is so ugly
-egQ79OrYCs,I can't wait to see this! The only problem I have is that katara and sokka's coats arn't blue but besides that it all looks great!
-egQ79OrYCs,@ilovewolfquest2 u play wq
-egQ79OrYCs,this is not how any of this happened. i will show up just to yell at the movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"I have been reading through the Chronicles of narnia and do you know what sokka and katara remind me of? Lucy and Edmund from The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lickerish24 Though you have to admit they did really well picking the princess that become the moon spirit. But have you noticed that some of martial arts styles are off? Like there is a point where zuko uses air style and aang is using rock style. Though oldly enough from what I've seen of the rock style, it is spot on. Thats...strange. Though I may be being to picky. *Shruggs*"
-egQ79OrYCs,"stop complaining and just watch..
after that, then REACT!
zzz"
-egQ79OrYCs,"hahai.. do u mind guys?
its american version..
not asian.. duhh..

if u dnt want to watch, then leave this page..
im an asian too..
but this movie implies the ""HUMAN VERSION"" of the avatar'n cartoon..

the hell u mind bout the characters, as long as they play their rule..
zzz"
-egQ79OrYCs,@robertharper1 I think they look pretty close.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Piece of crap movie. Don't watch it in theaters, Download it. Don't support the trend of movies that take something good and turn it into crap"
-egQ79OrYCs,WTF where is zuko's scar? And wasn't sokka supposed to be ponytailguy? O_o
-egQ79OrYCs,where are all the asians??
-egQ79OrYCs,dude who plays zuko dusnt look anything like him especially is ears that stik out like dumbo!!! hope their acting is good though im lookin forward to it
-egQ79OrYCs,i want this movie to be really good because the show was incredible but i think its going to ruin the show
-egQ79OrYCs,"Why did they get that guy to do Sokka?
Sokka looks like a nerd that bullies would stuff into a locker before lunch.
Man he was cool in the show.
Man I hope M. Night Shamalon doesn't destroy Avatar.
Man the show was freakin awesome."
-egQ79OrYCs,"katara's not right. she's probably a phenomenal acctress, but i will be focusing on the ay she looks the entire movie. but i can guarentee, that if there was no cartoon. everyone is this film would be perfect."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The costumes aren't that great either :( 
People would have gone crazy if harry potter was black, why the hell make these blatant none white characters white grrr.. haha I'll shut up."
-egQ79OrYCs,@coolbones So glad I am not the only one confused by this.
-egQ79OrYCs,"agree, they got the wrong charector for Zuko, pissed off with that tbh, Zuko is surposed to be hot, well at the end when he grows his air that is :L i sound like a freak ere :L he is not Indian he is like Japaniease [ i think ] im happy with Ang tho, and Katra is fine so is Socca :L haahaa he plays Jasper in twilight so im orite with him :D MoMo better be in it too"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@frezzyg The sad thing is that they are planning on making a movie based on each book of the series, and the casting does suck, but the thing that pisses me off most is the guy playing zuko, he looks NOTHING like zuko.."
-egQ79OrYCs,WHY IS KATARA AND SOKKA WHITE I AM ANGRY ABOUT THAT THEY look more mexican or a light skin african american could have tooke these roles they could have made the characters in this look how they really look they could gave katar blue contackts and glued in some fake weave or extensiosns
-egQ79OrYCs,"I may promise you all one thing: I really love the series, but this movie will suck and thereÂ´s many reasons why! First of all the cast  sucks. Second is that all costumes, hairstyles etc. are not even sililar to the original ones ( just remember aangs tatoos!! ). And last but not least it is simply impossible to put the ammount of information, tension and emotion delivered by the tv series into a standard leght movie! ...Too bad, I really would have enjoyed watching a GOOD transferring :("
-egQ79OrYCs,this is the real Karate kid..........not like will smiths son.    lol
-egQ79OrYCs,what the hell man no theyre really supposed to be asian. and it would look more gay?! you making fun of me fool? psh...-_- lol
-egQ79OrYCs,Omg so excited....and I'll be 20 when it finally comes out lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"wasnt this cartoon supposed to be about asians?
what`s up with all the white people?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"zuko's left eye has a scar right??
but it looks like an eye bag in this movie.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@zummiegirl 
You'd best be trolling."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I like the acting shown in the trailer for Zuko and Katara.

I'm worried about Aang though, his line in the trailer sounded off, the kid is a martial artist not an experienced actor. He probably had to take a crash course in acting."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The airbending effects look crap, but the waterbending looks pretty good."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@zummiegirl If they get Asians to play, it would actually look more like Avatar. Avatar was base on Eastern settings. Obviously Asians would look better in Asian clothes."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Anyone who watches movies online for free is KILLING THE MOVIE INDUSTRY!! If nobody sees it in theaters or buys it when its on DVD, there is no profit. No profit for the studio. No profit for the director.  No profit for anyone! And if they don't make money, they'll stop making movies. So, if one day the movie industry dies, you can thank the people who couldn't buy it for themselves. And also thank the websites that posted the videos in the first place!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I actually think that they need an Asian for Aang
Americans for Sokka and Katara
Australian for Toph
Hot European for Zuko...
Well, I know it's Asian based and all but I as I see it, it's supposed to be a battle and travel between different continents...
But anyway this casting have already been made...
And this will just be another movie I'll just wait for the CD to come out so I can rent it and spend a lot less money and effort than watching it in the theaters..."
-egQ79OrYCs,should have put in some asians
-egQ79OrYCs,AVATARDS!! TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!!
-egQ79OrYCs,This is so gay. They need to get asians to act this out.
-egQ79OrYCs,"a sÃ©rie Ã© excelente, o filme tambÃ©m serÃ¡, com certeza."
-egQ79OrYCs,i can't wait for its premier. this is out of this world.
-egQ79OrYCs,I wonder if its okay that Zuko's face isn't really that burned... and if that guy next to him was Iroh then I'm raising an eyebrow. Yet despite all my reservations I'm looking forward to watch it. As long as the characters are the way they used to be I'll be happy. :)
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't know what ur talking about, DBZ evolution looked like shit, even from the trailer, but what I'm seeing here is some serios stuff.  Maybe Shamalan (dont know if thats spelled right) will make this worth all our while."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheSuney 
avÂ·aÂ·tar  (v-tÃ¤r)
n.
1. The incarnation of a Hindu deity, especially Vishnu, in human or animal form.
2. An embodiment, as of a quality or concept; an archetype.
3. A temporary manifestation or aspect of a continuing entity.

An Avatar does not need to fit the exact description you mention. It can simply mean a representation/embodiment of some kind. Both Avatar and Avatar: The Last Airbender fit these descriptions. Long story short: You're wrong, get the fuck off my internets."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheSuney lol mate, stop being so butthurt..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The movie looks good, but actually ends up sucking . That's going to be M. Night's biggest twist."
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang is asian... He is Noah Ringer.. A filipino- american martial artist.. he starts learning wushuu d taekwondo siince 7 years old.. Now he is a black belter of both
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ClazzicGamer if you remember he only learns one each season

season 1:water
season 2: Earth
season 3: Fire"
-egQ79OrYCs,"This was directed by James Cameron right? It's about that alien planet right? 

But, I don't see any 10-foot-tall blue aliens. LOL

HA! Now, you know how it feels!"
-egQ79OrYCs,doesnt look too bad :D
-egQ79OrYCs,@podius o really ... cool.. thx for the info
-egQ79OrYCs,you gotta be kidding me this movie is gonne be fucking different and i hope they show toph and this is gonna be the first movie when they went to the north pole u gotta be kidding me zuko is a fucking indain no scar wtf i know my avatar than anyone so ya
-egQ79OrYCs,The casting looks pretty bad why is no one asian and since when is the slumdog millioaire a good pick for zuko???
-egQ79OrYCs,"I didn't even know it was going to be Book 1 of the series, that's cool actually!
I'm not a fan of sequels, but 3 seasons, 3 books, I hope they do a good job with it :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm dying to see this one!! It looks so great heheh I've already seen the animation!!! looking forward to this!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I am really looking forward to this movie. I'm pretty upset about the last minute decision to go 3-D, though. Unless you film in 3-D from the start, it seems to come out pretty bad (Clash of the Titans for example). Judging by the trailer, Night seems to have remained about as faithful to the source material as he could. It should turn out well as long as he doesn't go the some BS ""twist"" at the end."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@hubacchris 

I'm sorry, but did you just site that atrocity known as ""Dragon Ball: Evolution"" as an example of how an animated series can be successfully translated into live action?  Because if you really did, then I would have to suggest you check yourself into your nearest psychiatric ward.  That was by far the worst, most unfaithful adaptation of an animated series that I have ever had the displeasure of seeing on the big screen."
-egQ79OrYCs,man i hope they make it  like where its like the  series of books where one movies about water bending and ones about earth bending you know... thatd  be tight!
-egQ79OrYCs,"i hope theres some comedy in the movie, thats what i liked the most in the series, also some action."
-egQ79OrYCs,@bstarqueen11 ooh and Zuko doesn't have his scar.  and Zuko is WHITE!  They make him like Indian or something in this movie!  Sry not being racist.  Not good at telling races apart sometimes
-egQ79OrYCs,@KidaMiso I know...  Aaang isnt as cute(baby cute) as he is in the show.  He doesn't have that smile.  Katara isn't an Indian as it says she is in the show.  And Sokka looks like he doesn't have that sarcasm like in the show.  But we can't judge until we actually see it.  July 2!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"uh oh, it looks like its going to be SERIOUS MODE AANG. BOOOOOO"
-egQ79OrYCs,@IloveBillKalitz She apparently doesn't have them in this movie...Although you could see some parts of her side hair have thin braids.
-egQ79OrYCs,Where's Katara's hair loopies!!
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf is up with al the spam youtube do something!! Also where is zuko's scar and pony tail!
-egQ79OrYCs,how on earth did they stuff a four season show into a one hour movie??? :O
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't know why it makes me remember big trouble in little china.  so many great scenarios of movies today!  but movies back in the 80' had WAY more essence.
-egQ79OrYCs,Anybody know the song name of the trailer?
-egQ79OrYCs,"i  just wonder WHY THE FUCK doesn't aang have BLUE arrows??? instead of those stupid symbols or stuff, the original is blue .."
-egQ79OrYCs,I wonder one thing.. Where is Zukos scar?
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie looks amazing. I am a big fan of the cartoon series and I cannot wait for this to arrive! I think all the people leaving hateful comments have a simple solution before them: Don't see the movie.  Either support it or piss off while the rest of us enjoy a great movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara is ugly!
-egQ79OrYCs,YAYYYY FINALY! lol :P they definatly could have picked a better Zuko -__- but I AM happy with the sokka choice :)
-egQ79OrYCs,oh my this is crap and come on Aang is a very lil kid and so weired omfg and zouko come on haha dude ya seen him!?
-egQ79OrYCs,PERFEITO ^^
-egQ79OrYCs,the first season crammed into a hour and thirty minute movie
-egQ79OrYCs,Nickelodeon ftw!
-egQ79OrYCs,SO PUMPED
-egQ79OrYCs,holy crap that looks awsome
-egQ79OrYCs,"awe im sad nun of these characters look like thee tv show it kinda sucks!!!
&& wats up wiff Zuko he kinda looks indian or mexican or some shit  not asian im so disappointed:("
-egQ79OrYCs,dude isnt it called avatar the last airbender and i didnt know aangs arrow was made up of signs i though they were just blue arrows
-egQ79OrYCs,@ACCFJeremiah your saying this movie is racist but your the real one thats racist
-egQ79OrYCs,Why is Shyamalan's name in the title as if this was his story? That guy's ego is limitless!
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope they did use the funny parts like in the real avatar show. But i think this movie is more serious..
-egQ79OrYCs,"@STARCRAFTOWNINGPRO 
Zuko does have a scar :/ its just hard as hell to see! .. i wish it was more pronounced.. if you watch the other trailer you see it ... gotta look hard though"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Everyone is whining about the characters being not the good race as in the animated tv-show. People, come on, it's a movie, not the animated tv-show. Learn to accept differences."
-egQ79OrYCs,@geminicouture44  all i see is one indian guy and the rest are white people...
-egQ79OrYCs,doesn't look like him his is to young
-egQ79OrYCs,the cast for zuko and irho sucks
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheSpiderfly ya that would have to be one long movie if they were going to get the whole story line in there!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,@avatarlover1111 Ah K cool. Coz there is a bit too much in the story to make into one movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,this could bring back painful memories of dragon ball evolution...
-egQ79OrYCs,the series was a perfect blend of comedy and drama...I hope this movie has some laughs :(
-egQ79OrYCs,lol pause at 0:57
-egQ79OrYCs,Can it get anymore racist
-egQ79OrYCs,"Fuck M Night Shymalangdigdong, fuck the film, and fuck Nickelodeon, you greedy bastards!"
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie better not be fucking gay like dragon ball z evolution it look gay already because theres white ppl in it
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really wanna see this and I hope it isnt a dissapointment, but then again what movie directed by M Night Shyamalan is a dissapointment?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah you can animate this but you cant film it, cgi just doesnt go with the real movements of the actors, actor who plays aang is just swinging his arms about."
-egQ79OrYCs,@Th3GiRLNeXTD00r Youre still little {:-]
-egQ79OrYCs,damn they just killed the show. lame ass actors
-egQ79OrYCs,"did u watched TV shows? if u remember Toph appeared in second season! this is the first movie, so there will be another 2 series"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I dont think the movie will be as good as the tv show. 1. I dont see Toph, or Opah. 2. The movie wont be long enough to put all the information in. 3. I didnt see Iroh, and if I did he's not fat enough. 4. I doubt there will be time to make Zuko become good. And lastley Aang looks too chubby."
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheSpiderfly i think that they are making two movies one that comes out this year and one that comes out next year. So its like part one and part two. so this one covers like pretty far and then the second one will finish with them fighting the fire lord. Thats what i heard they were doing.
-egQ79OrYCs,"From what i understand, this movie actually covers the whole story, right through to defeating the Fire Lord."
-egQ79OrYCs,This looks so fucking good.  Movie of the summer?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@changobilly22  I dont think anyone's  playing bumi in this movie, but maybe the next one if its based on book 2 earth"
-egQ79OrYCs,"the characters seems darker  a bit like Aang and Sokka, I hope its because its scenes from the battle, and they're not like that the entire movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I loved the TV series, but I am still indifferent about the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,@jaguar4u2 how about you get an acting job then?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@randydragoncheeks in fact i'm not even sure why people are even questioning if the characters are supposed to be asian or not. the way in which the characters are drawn are not to indicate race but are in fact a tradition/hallmark of japanese animation, for example the semi-large eyes and exaggerated expressions. If you're still in doubt google ""Avatar: the last Airbender"" or look it up on wikipedia."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@randydragoncheeks air nation seems to be based tibetan-buddhist culture. and in fact there shouldnt be much ambiguity on the fact that the four nations ""bending styles"" are modelled after four very old and classic martial arts."
-egQ79OrYCs,anyone would like to agree to put Pyramid by Charice ft. Iyaz as the main theme song of this movie please click Like if u agree :)
-egQ79OrYCs,....... were the comedy? i wonder wha appa gunna look like
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Ben95cool Appa was in Trailer 3, and if he's in it, momo's in it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@islandknight20  yea man it looks cool,but its the actors or somthing,something is just letting me down....be honest did ang look asian to you in the anime,cause i got to say he looked caucasian to me..fire benders and earth looked asian,but i agree man,mabye its just little detail that were important are nto represented"
-egQ79OrYCs,@randydragoncheeks no kidding. my biggest issue (and no offense to anyone here) is why they casted sokka and katara (and possibly the entire water nation) as caucasian? and maybe they should have kept the original voice actor to play zuko. just my opinion though.. I still have great hopes for this movie and the cast.
-egQ79OrYCs,"please dear movie god whoever you are, don't let them disappoint me on this representation of one of the GREATEST ANIMES EVER"
-egQ79OrYCs,"graphics and that all seem to fit well,,but somethig seems off about the actors."
-egQ79OrYCs,What happened to all the asians?  Oh forgot its been yellow faced.
-egQ79OrYCs,The description is wrong. He's 112 years old. But actually he turns out 12.
-egQ79OrYCs,anyone know the name of the music in this trailer?
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie is going to b sooo beast. :D cant wait
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant believe i forgot the chicks name but what other movies has she played in cuz i've seen her in uther movies....her lips are the tip! they r huge!
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:07 I think the guy on the left is suppose to be Iroh, but I'm still unsure.  I suppose will have to wait and see it when it finally comes to theaters everywhere."
-egQ79OrYCs,it has to be animated im so real sry but it just has to
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope it issen't a fail like the dragonball movie was :S
-egQ79OrYCs,"@chrisQuintana i think its gonna cover all three books, but book 1 is a garanteed"
-egQ79OrYCs,isn't zuko supposed to be asian?
-egQ79OrYCs,thats fuckin nice!!! hope its as epic as the tv show!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,1:07 - is that Iroh? Or Zhao perhaps?
-egQ79OrYCs,cant wait :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@bigmoen99  BOOK TWO.....
-egQ79OrYCs,where us toff?
-egQ79OrYCs,@Ben95cool appa is in the movie u can see him in avatar the last airbender trailer 3 momo i still dont know
-egQ79OrYCs,Why Katra and Sokka are blonds??? and why all the people from the nation of fire are Hindus??
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko doesn't have a scar... Zuko doesn't have a scar... car... mar... char... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! WHY!!!???
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Ben95cool 
I dunno if momo is in the movie but appa is... watch:-   The Last Airbender Trailer 3 1080p HD **OFFICIAL**   -at 0.09"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i dont watch the cartoons because its too childish
but damn this movie looks promising"
-egQ79OrYCs,omg were is zuko's scar!!! mabey he gets it latter on
-egQ79OrYCs,"@koreanboy89 
hehehe:P Zuko looks indeed nothing like the cartoon. I didnt even see a scar yet, but ahw well...im still curious:) If the movie does suck, i always have my dvd boxes avatar left^^"
-egQ79OrYCs,"is the Best Live Action Ever seen..is full Loyal to the Nickelodeon Serie, I think it'll Be Great..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddyH335 

well said. Too much moaning about race of actors about racism. Oh booo friggin hoo they got foreigners to play asians. Its a hollywood movie for Gods sake so lets just enjoy the ride. This movie looks terrific and i will check it out for sure"
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie will rock. I love m m night and he is a terrific diretor
-egQ79OrYCs,"If M. Nigh Shyamalan is directing ten bucks the movie is going to suck. or maybe it won't! The man cannot do scary if it bit him on the ass and said here I am! So maybe, he at least can do a childrens cartoon adaptation. Hopefully he will get this correctly. I doubt I will see this though."
-egQ79OrYCs,WTH? Zuko is not indian!! WTF!!!?!?!?!?!?
-egQ79OrYCs,the fire nation is suppose to be chinese -.-
-egQ79OrYCs,haha only way this movie could get any worse is if they put in nicholas cage in there xD
-egQ79OrYCs,omg the arrows are aupposed to be blue not a weird black and  lacy looking patterns
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope there wont be a trilogy. cause this looks like its gonna follow the first season story line.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Ryosolo my bad i knew i was gonna spell their name incorrectly haha. Well they sorta look like white to me. And for Zuko, looks nothing like him haha"
-egQ79OrYCs,Thats why it looks so serious M. Night Shymalan did not want to add childish humor to the film
-egQ79OrYCs,I read that M. Night Shyamalan took out most of the childish humor and decided not to add it in the film
-egQ79OrYCs,"Eh I was looking forward to this movie until I saw the trailer. Technology just isn't ready for this movie to be made yet. I mean, maybe James Cameron can do it but I doubt it lol. Plus, the characters could look a little more like in the toon. And I don't see how they could fit all of those ""books"" into just one movie. It'd be better if the did each book a different movie I think, I summerize those up instead of jumbling all of them together."
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko is all wrong!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@koreanboy89 
They're not that white, and theyre called Sokka and Katara"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@runescapezhao 
If he plays the role supergood, would it matter?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@shabalabadingdong713 
except in the actual cartoon Aang is 12 years old."
-egQ79OrYCs,am i wrong or dose the guy in 0:45 - 0:48 look like M from the league.......
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm not trying to be racist but, casting indian guys as fire nation guys is just so wrong. The guy playing zuko doesn't even look like zuko.."
-egQ79OrYCs,Umm why is zuko INDIAN!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,i wish that the movie would be better than the series coz i really really really love the cartoon series of this.. i think ive finished that series from book 1-3 at least 6 times..i really hope that they did well in recreating the cartoon into 3D..
-egQ79OrYCs,Lol since when were Sakka and Kitara white haha
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant see taf in this trailer...
-egQ79OrYCs,please dont fuck up this movie! i hope its good! love the show
-egQ79OrYCs,"It looks like his scar is there, but it's just a black marking. Not very scar-ish. :("
-egQ79OrYCs,"Even though Aang is supposed to be young, he looks TOO young. Kitara looks way older than him :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Yazk17 Desert cactus juice?
-egQ79OrYCs,@stolatos05 probably havn't fineshed the animation for him is my guess
-egQ79OrYCs,"@shabalabadingdong713 Aang is supposed to be young, he's 12"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really, really hope this doesn't disappoint. Soooo looking forward to this :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,Who's playing Azhula???!! She must be hot and bad... So must Zukho... XD  and Sakka better be funny.... :P
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lilfredd1393 aww(:
of course I'm going to watch it with you!!
I told you a long long long time ago that
we had to see it together!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3"
-egQ79OrYCs,Fucking Awesome!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@stolatos05 Lolfail, xD Would be fun xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,that was a good trailer.....lot's of action.
-egQ79OrYCs,Not watching this bullshit there Europeans WTF and they got that Indian ass hole from that shitty indian movie im not even an anime guy but i liked this show they ruined an hour of my say at least
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie is either gonna be freakin good or a complete fail because of shitty effects..  god i hope its gonna be good :)
-egQ79OrYCs,WTF this is gunna be a bull shit movie were is the lafs and fun thay hadd
-egQ79OrYCs,does anyone know what the song is and who the artist is in this trailer?
-egQ79OrYCs,when is this movie comming out?????
-egQ79OrYCs,"@eddyH335  LOL it isn't all about ""acting"" in the description for who they wanted as actors they put that they definitely wanted white actors. There are plenty of Asian actors. :/

Everyone that says they aren't being racist says, ""How do you know that it isn't white people in an Asian influenced world?"" Well, why can't it be, ""How do you know that it isn't Asian people in an Asian influenced world?"" hahaaha"
-egQ79OrYCs,"The casting isnt bad, i just feel like they should have at least TRIED to hide their racial attributes. Like have sokka and katara get a tan!!! The water tribe is supposed to be like an Inuit tribe. And where is Zuko's ponytail? And why does Iroh look like such a carefree character! The cast doesnt suck, its the inaccuracy. Iroh is supposed to be a chubby jolly guy with an inner serious streak and big heart. He seems to be like every other fire nation general in this trailer. THAT IS NOT IROH!"
-egQ79OrYCs,wtffff........ i hate the cast.... and i thought the last airbender was based on chinese characters? .... -.-
-egQ79OrYCs,M.Night Shymalan is a mean dieretor..this looks like its going to be a good watch..hope it lives up to the hype.
-egQ79OrYCs,M. Night better not fuck this movie up.....
-egQ79OrYCs,"I can live with the people play Aang and Zuko.
But a white Katara and Sokka? C'mon...At least chose someone that either looked a bit asain or had a darker skin. I mean, they aren't white is the series. Why should they be in the movie?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"omgg!! Suko iss sooow horrible!!
hes sow not the caracter of the cartoon
not to be verry pikey but in the cartoon he use to be handsome sow WHAT HAPPEND??!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"sokka looks like""derp derp"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"@SuperToastytoast Duhh, They're planning to make3 other sequels. Lol let's just hope this one turns good."
-egQ79OrYCs,is it only about the first season!?
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant wait to see this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"@JocySmiles

-egQ79OrYCs,@sirtrixalot12 your a douche
-egQ79OrYCs,"@hydroblast9  Good question, where the EFF is appa? he played almost a bigger role in the series then Aang did! lol."
-egQ79OrYCs,wow i fucking love avatar.. im so excited!! :D
-egQ79OrYCs,i just hope they dont make this a kids a movie -___-where there is like no blood and the fighting is gay and stuff i hope i see some MOTHER FKIN ACTION cuz i love the show =)
-egQ79OrYCs,why dose he have a cross tattooed on his back im watch in the show now and i see no cross thats my only complaint so far
-egQ79OrYCs,what i hope this movie does is be to dark. what i liked about the show was the humor and the sick action. the trailers just make it seem this movie is going to be 100% serious
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks way 2 serius like wers th comedy wers th aang we no and love instaed its ths weird serius kid tht ahhhhhhhhhhhgggggggg
-egQ79OrYCs,"cÂ´mon guys it is not half bad, all though it will never beat  the series, the animation kept us waitning for years and i doubt it will be surpassed."
-egQ79OrYCs,Wheres the Bison?
-egQ79OrYCs,I can't wait! :) I loved the animation and I really hope this will be good as well! :)
-egQ79OrYCs,At least Zuko looks a little like what I imagined he would look like.........
-egQ79OrYCs,I loved the animated series.  I really want this film to be great!
-egQ79OrYCs,looks so good!!!!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@yaquto 

I hope it too ;)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't mean it bad... but I think, it will be better, when they're asian actors... but everybody has another opinion"
-egQ79OrYCs,"no matter how this movie turns out , there is still the anime series out there :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,@starshipSuperNova Yea it's just the book of water(1st season)
-egQ79OrYCs,"@volcomsky13 Well the blind girl won't be in this movie because it's based on the first book/season( the water tribe), but there is the girl who Sokka fell in love with, the one dealing with the moon in one of the trailers. Looks really good and realistic"
-egQ79OrYCs,terrible
-egQ79OrYCs,I have a bad feeling that this may turn out like the Eragon Movie did... I just hope it doesn't.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Omegafire17
1. Ah, okay.
2. Have you seriously never heard of wikipedia? And no, no he wouldn't.
3. That sentence doesn't even make sense. If it says what I think it does: I don't have a problem with any ""race color"". I think asians should play asian characters, whites white characters, blacks black characters, etc. If a character's race isn't specified or is ambiguous, that's one thing, but it's obviously not the case here.

I'm just going to ignore that last part as it's unbelievably stupid."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@julianzolo The biggest problem is all the beautiful white people are the heroes and the minorities are the bad guys

M Night wants to be White, self hating racist"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Omegafire17 Oh right totally, let's have an Asian play Tony Stark, let's have denzel washington play peter parker.  Why don't we let Will Ferrel play bruce lee in a documentry?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kuraruka 
1. ""they"" are the actors of this The Last Airbender (the white ones)
2. one: i don't know who sameul L. jackson is, so i couldn't say anything about him 
two: i believe he could have a chance, not that he would get the part
3. NO ONE should have a problem with race color OF ANY KIND (that's my opinion, of course)
and anyone who calls people retarded ARE retards (again my opinion)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Omegafire17
You're retarded, for the following reasons:
1. You didn't specify who ""they"" refers to, as there are multiple possibilities given the context of our conversation.
2. In the case of Samuel L. Jackson playing Frodo, you're a complete fucking moron if you think people would accept him playing that role. And really, there's no reason why they should.
3. In the case of white actors playing asian characters (it's called whitewashing, look it up), plenty of people have a problem with it."
-egQ79OrYCs,@volcomsky13 the blind girl name is tauf ( not sure if its spelled right) :P
-egQ79OrYCs,@volcomsky13 Zuko's uncle is there .. as for the monkey the buffalo and the blind girl i donno... hope they have a platypus bear!! =D
-egQ79OrYCs,cant wait to see this movie!!!!! and i'm 13 ... lol I used to wach the animated one =)
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kuraruka no one said they can't do these roles just because of their skin color, anyone who says otherwise is just dumb (and that apparently includes you, no offense)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Omegafire17
It's not just asian-influenced, genius. It's set in a world in which every culture and nation is analogous to a real-world asian counterpart. The show *is* asian. Having the lead characters played by white actors makes about as much sense as having Frodo played by Samuel L. Jackson."
-egQ79OrYCs,"No, I'm calling you a moron because you said something... moronic."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ElectricRaptor

1. It's a cartoon that takes place in an asian setting. Literally everything about the show is asian.
2. Not that hard. Maybe you're just dumb.
3. Who's getting emotional? Did I raise my voice or something?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ThatMercerBoy
Also yes. Yes it does, you moron."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ThatMercerBoy 
M. Night Shyamalan... a better director...
Oh Christ I fell out of my chair laughing."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@GuaishouUchiha 
Hey i kinda agree with you...if this movie is good i hope they remake dragonball with the same producer nd theres a differnece these actors are better"
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh god... I hate it... it's like Dragonball.. it's Asian.. but the actors are all american people... why?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ImNotGothOrEmo 
@#4 well duh toph doesnt show up till the 2nd book fyi and doesnt azula come out in the 2nd book too? dude, watch the series again and watch jeffpalmer's the last airbender open movie advice up here on utube"
-egQ79OrYCs,omgosh can't wait to see this movie i have been dieing to see it since feb 15 uughhh!!!! im going crazy! this movie is going to be so good and with appa being the cutest! its so dang popular people are always commenting!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Tacom4ster Is too soon to say that.  and the most hated director must be the one from ""dragonball evolution"",  that was really crap."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ImNotGothOrEmo Still,  looks WAY BETTER than ""dragonball evolution"",  in that one they didn't even try to make it like the cartoon"
-egQ79OrYCs,"M Night Shamalyan will be the most hated filmmaker by fans since Joel Schmaucuer

This is movie is going fail"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kuraruka 

Its a freaking cartoon, It's really hard to tell the difference between an asian and a white person in a cartoon. You don't have to get so ridiculously emotional over a youtube comment just because you disagree."
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh you're mature. calling me a moron just because you disagree.
-egQ79OrYCs,I wonder what appa and mo mo looks like ?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Looks pretty good, besides the lack of asians"
-egQ79OrYCs,Not about chars guys its about effects and story just watch it looks pretty good from story point of view
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang is too young. They should have kept the original design of the Airbdenders' tattoos. And most of all, I don't think they will show enough of Aang's ""light"" side. Judging from the trailer, I think this will all be war and blood, nothing comic that made people loved the series. Argh I hate this"
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm... disappointed. I love the animated show but this is simply ridiculous.
-egQ79OrYCs,why is aang the only asian?????
-egQ79OrYCs,"it would have been better animated, they made aang some little runt whos arrows on his body look nothing alike, and also sokka and kitara look nothing like i imagined. i just hope this movie is better than the previews, because now that im looking at it im having  second thoughts about seeing it. if you disagree with me then thats your opinion, i dont want to hear your opinion so dont bother sending one"
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG isn't that jackson rathbone from twilight?  he's adorable!
-egQ79OrYCs,hmm ok the middle eastern looking guys are the bad guyss lol why am i not surprised.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@edwinurroz  If you look up the interviews, they're going to do 3 parts covering the whole series."
-egQ79OrYCs,"its probably going to cover only 1 book, any more would mean they will shorten it and cut many details out which will suck... hope it turns out good"
-egQ79OrYCs,does this movie like cover just one of the chapters???
-egQ79OrYCs,What the hell Zuko looks like that ugly guy from slumdog millionaire. He's supposed to be attractive not F'ing hideous. Jesus can't this director do anything right?! He's totally killing the story and these trailers suck ass. They should have given the movie rights to someone who would do it justice.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@4l33r4 I went onto IMDB and he is in it. I wouldn't think they would take such a major character out just pointing out that we don't see him in this trailor, the special effects probably aren't finished. Momo is in it also he and Appa are voiced by the creator who also does the voices in the animation. I'm willing to give this film a go then decide after I've seen it. Yes I agree it seems to be true to the look of the series. Thanks for replying:)"
-egQ79OrYCs,Deez is not about any color of skin nevertheless they have to use the most looked ppl 'cuz they don't look like the originals. AND Momo? &  Apa?
-egQ79OrYCs,@ITW4949 just because the show is asian-influenced doesn't mean the people ARE asians
-egQ79OrYCs,@jeremievang u mean yellow folks.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@cbkh915 he'll go there, i was actualz suprised bz this trailer, because it was following the story... and i was checking imdb - there is one guy who will be voice of both - Appa and Momo so it's ok... i just hope that the movie will be as good as the traler promisses"
-egQ79OrYCs,Is that supposed to be iroh? Some skinny bastard with a big nose? They are ruining this story.....
-egQ79OrYCs,i think this movie is just the series in Real life and in a movie :3
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DizzyLeigh i don't think they would remove Appa. They would have to think about other transport. this trailer looks a lot like animated Avatar, so Appa must be there (i would be really angry if he wasn't). i'm more afraid about losing Momo"
-egQ79OrYCs,wow! I really thing this could turn up well!
-egQ79OrYCs,I see no Appa in this trailor I hope they are only keeping what he looks like a secret or maybe they haven't finished making him in special effects. they better have him in it cause some film makers remove main characters all the time cause they don't care about the fan base and ppl who are new to the story won't know any better. It will all be in how well Appa is made lol.
-egQ79OrYCs,Other than maybe bad and byest (wrong spelling sorry) casting this trailor doesn't really give us much to gone about if it will be good or not. Can't really say it will be crap until we have seen it.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Lenrom12 I always felt that if they had a race Katara and Sokka where more eskimo in their nationality, Aang was more Asian as was Zuko. But I also felt that they didn't really have nationalities as we have just the 4 Bending nations and those who lived under the 4. I hope this film is good but I won't hold my breath. M. Night is a hit and mostly miss director/writer he has good ideas but seems to fall short. Maybe because it's someone elses story it will be good:)"
-egQ79OrYCs,i want to punch whoever made this movie in the face. katara and sooka were black aang was white zuko looked cxooler sokka looks gay zuko looks gay aang looks gay dam they may ennd up ruining the anime
-egQ79OrYCs,"@rados3 I'm just miffed that a series referenced to ancient china.... Literally has no other race other then White or Indian(Big surprise)

Especially how when the bending is based off of martial arts styles, half of the cast looked Chinese in the show and.. OH YEAH, THEY READ FREAKING CHINESE SCROLLS. <_<

I am going to see it, and who knows, I might actually like it.. But the fact that the directer took away all of the race diversity (Like some OTHER movie) doesn't give me much hope."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@rolutos *spoilers*

TECHNICALLY speaking, Ang is already Zuko's great cousin.. Of course, I could be wrong since it's been way too long since I've seen that episode. XD"
-egQ79OrYCs,shut up! this is the best series ever!
-egQ79OrYCs,"better for his life shylaman dont screwed this, cuz its the best animation serie ever!"
-egQ79OrYCs,bullshit
-egQ79OrYCs,I was worried that Zuko wouldn't have a scar over his eye.
-egQ79OrYCs,Did you know that the guy whos gonna play Zuko is Jamal in Slumdog Millionare?? It's soo weird!
-egQ79OrYCs,@ElectricRaptor Do you enjoy being a moron?
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf they made him reach almost his full potential in 1 single movie!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ElectricRaptor 
Really? It's racist to expect that the actors for a movie look like the actual characters instead of being completely whitewashed?

I take it, then, you'd have no problem with a movie about George Washington having him played by, say, a black guy? Because otherwise you're full of shit."
-egQ79OrYCs,what is the song at 1:00
-egQ79OrYCs,what is the song at 1:00
-egQ79OrYCs,whats the song that starts at like 1:00
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Wildzide00  well hite eskimos makes sense, ya know, not too much sunlight there and people gets palid from the cold, just like the switzerland people.(dont know how its say  people taht comesf rom switzerland"

-egQ79OrYCs,"THIS IS AVATAR, not that alien-pocahontas shit."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I just have one problem here, the show was heavily influenced by East Asian culture/architecture/beliefs yet there's not a single person in the movie that represents that fact."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Â¡Katara se ve PRECIOSA! La verdad, hubiera preferido que los de la naciÃ³n del fuego, los de la tierra y el aire fueran de ojos rasgos, pues al ver el marco cultural ficticio en que se desenvuelven, esa impresiÃ³n me dan (digo, los de la naciÃ³n del fuego Â¡Â¡Â¡escriben en chino!!!). OjalÂ´+a que los cambios que hicieron -como la cicatriz de Zuko- sean para bien..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"White Eskimos, Caucasian Aang and a Zuko without a scar wich makes no sense at all due to the fact that his scar is what marks his dishonor and the psychological trauma he carried along the entire anime wich was essential for the character development.

This will suck just like DBZ Evolution."
-egQ79OrYCs,imma watchi his :D
-egQ79OrYCs,I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE !!! :D
-egQ79OrYCs,actualy firebenders should be dark skin begins their land is very hot.
-egQ79OrYCs,What's avatar? and who are airbenders?
-egQ79OrYCs,"i watched the trailer again, where's zuko's scar? lol fail?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Its annoying that u wont be hearing the original voice actors :( and i agree with youtuviewer. its also not about being racist, its about trying to reinact the original characters, not by fuckin it up with actors that have no resemblence of the characters... Thats like saying ur ok with someone recreating Naruto as a movie, staring nick cannon as naruto LOL. gosh, flashing the race card is soo bad... and im asian!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@youtuviewer i agree  but whats avatar season four never heard of it didnt oit end
-egQ79OrYCs,aang zuko and iroh should have been recasted and have aang blue soild tats instead of theses gay ones and better fire nation uniforms haha katar and soka and yuea are good though haha
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG awesome trailer love it
-egQ79OrYCs,zuco has no mark on his eye dats stupid bt it might be good
-egQ79OrYCs,"@rolutos 
The twist will be that aang can see dead people, walking around like normal people, and that water actually burns waterbenders."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I am sick of you who always have something to criticize for trailers of new movies! Does not matter who will be acting in the movie, and of what race is an actor, and what production house making films... It is important that the movie story is good, that those actors who have chosen to do the job well... I think the movie gona be damn good! :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Charzzziex jup there is i saw the commercial for it to day on the tv on nickelodeon so it has to be real
-egQ79OrYCs,@youtuviewer  is there really going 2 be new season O_O?
-egQ79OrYCs,they cant call it avater because we have thr movie avatar :faggeatron ... !!$@#$
-egQ79OrYCs,nive i loven it ( like mcdonals ^_^ )
-egQ79OrYCs,"btw its not korean.. its an american created cartoon, therefore it is not seen on as an anime. it has been influenced by chinese art, japanese anime,buddhism (a lot of asian culture)et cetera, and therefore contains the elements it does. this is why they didnt need a special race or skin color on the different characters..if you're really a indepth fan you should've known this and not complain cause of the cast. and if you still do.. your a moron! the thing that worries me is the darkness of it."
-egQ79OrYCs,well atleast the moon chick looks alright
-egQ79OrYCs,wow just watching this makes me never wanna watch avatar again
-egQ79OrYCs,white kid for aang fucking why
-egQ79OrYCs,"I dont want to see this movie, because of such the bad actors, and the fact if I watch it, Ill be dissapointed. And I wont be able to watch the original cartoon ever again."
-egQ79OrYCs,i really hope James Cameron can get with Nicktoons to create a more accurate depiction of Avatar the Last Air Bender...
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't care what race the actors are if they play the part well. Stop being racist babies.

-egQ79OrYCs,"I can already tell that they ruined their chance at making a good movie out of the series. it is just TOO SERIOUS, where is Aang's playful attitude? What is with all the stone hard faces he makes? The fans are going to get really mad. I know this one is."
-egQ79OrYCs,its the first book's movie so there is no toph or azula.
-egQ79OrYCs,@ericboii i hope that's not toph....it looks like a man  o.o
-egQ79OrYCs,im not sure if i like zuku or not. he is my favorite character :)
-egQ79OrYCs,I think this looks awesome I'm a big fan but it doesn't seem like they messed it up unlike in twilight they messed it up and people still watched it. So I'm definitely going to see it!

-egQ79OrYCs,"i'm a huge fan of the cartoon and i'm excited to see this, mostly for the bending. i think everyone should just try to not set their expectations too high- of course it will be different from the show, how could it be the same?- but as long as the bending is sick and the philosophical/spiritual aspects aren't glossed over, it should be a good time!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,It should also be funny like the animated series.. I don't like the way aang looked too serious..haha
-egQ79OrYCs,the effects look amzing but i hope they dont make this movie crappy otherwise imma be realli pissedd off...and the avatar in this movie actually reminds me aang but sokka in dis movie looks a bit more serious unlike in d cartoon...i hope this movie is really good tho!
-egQ79OrYCs,@KickAssGamerChick well they already f*cked up the casting...
-egQ79OrYCs,@refan6 i think it was becouse it was waaayyyy to far from the manga/anime itself. Ya know like making a die hard movie in the style of my little pony cartoons... and making it about saving cupcakes from being stolen... I dont think people would accept that as a die hard film XD
-egQ79OrYCs,"hope this isn't like dragon ball haha

(although honestly i enjoyed it, don't know why ppl be hating on it)"
-egQ79OrYCs,Man Iroh is not fat enough! He sounds like Iroh but he does not look like him! I hope he is funny or at least some sense of humor! They are making this movie almost too serious.

-egQ79OrYCs,oh wow i can't wait ~!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lugiabase Watch the first trailer when they show Aang looking at everyone fighting in the Waterbender city, u can see the back of his body in the upper left hand corner."
-egQ79OrYCs,@EaslyaMUSEdgal Their making a trilogy of the series so Toph will appear in the next one... hopefully she'll be the tough smartass she was on the show

cuz a big part of AVATAR is the comdey too."
-egQ79OrYCs,yes finally a good anime reel life movie unlike db evolution this is going to take u on a ride of your life =) yes cant wate
-egQ79OrYCs,@KickAssGamerChick agreed 100%
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope that this is just the first book....cuz the anime is great:D...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@itsPandemonium 
yeah...the original story line is that katara's 14 and aang's 12.maybe they couldnt find suitable ppl to portray them.they changed the tattoo too...and zuko's scar seems to be missing o.o"
-egQ79OrYCs,Would be funny to see the guy who always foams at the mouth when he see Aang XD
-egQ79OrYCs,can't wait to see the movie when Zuko will have long hair...mmm mmm good =D
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang always looks serious and sad.I think he should be more of a  goofy kid like in the television series
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Srilankin theres gonna be 3 movies bro, relax. this is based on the first book/season which ends with the siege of the north"
-egQ79OrYCs,"thats when u own ppl and say this one was the original, and the two have nothing to do with eachother anyway so u look extra smart to toher ppl lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"don't think it will be so good, in my oppinion. i meen, it will be pretty hard to squeeze so much from a season that it won't be good. they should have maid a new story, perhaps another 100 years would do"
-egQ79OrYCs,Where is zuko's scar?
-egQ79OrYCs,@lugiabase don't get me scared  O.O
-egQ79OrYCs,I heard he was making 3 movies that followed the cartoon series. I expect to see some familiar faces in those. Maybe a cameo of M. Night himself(as a fire bender). XD
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow... So doesn't seem as funny as the tv show. He is going to kill all the humour in this movie...
-egQ79OrYCs,Holy crap my doughts are now gone for this movie unless shit does hit the fan in it
-egQ79OrYCs,"@leebog31. lol i see what u mean, but the symbol for the airbenders is that '666' looking thing becouse aperantly thats what wind looks like... lmao xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@itsPandemonium.  have u ever watched the actual show? aang was a kid. fukn' dumbazs.. ( ps, this movie is gonna be badazs :D )"
-egQ79OrYCs,Symbol I ment. Damn iPhones!
-egQ79OrYCs,The last airbender the only one of his kind. Pause the trailer as soon as you see the symbolon his forehead and you will see 666 right in the middle. WTF?
-egQ79OrYCs,you kno the teenage firebender is the guy from slumdog millionaire?just lettin ya kno lol

-egQ79OrYCs,"James Cameron bought the rights to the name ""Avatar"". Which sucks cause this series has been around longer than James Cameron's visually good but crappy story movie. Can't wait to see Airbender!!! I am glad M Night is doing a different genre."
-egQ79OrYCs,I will reserve judgement until i see the movie!  I loved the series and I am curious to see it in live action.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well its cause james cameron bought the rights to the name ""Avatar"" which even more crappier~"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I've seen every single episode. Shit. That's how fucking lame I am, and trust me. When Zuko looks Asian, even more when he cuts his hair. His girlfriend, Mei looks Asian too. Toph does too."
-egQ79OrYCs,the fighting and sht is pretty bad ass but the tattoos r wrong....
-egQ79OrYCs,they have the wrong tattoo's on Aang
-egQ79OrYCs,oh shit
-egQ79OrYCs,CAnnot wait will be interesting to see how much stuff they skip and miss though
-egQ79OrYCs,i PREY they stick to the story line
-egQ79OrYCs,"@greetingzuzers 

In fact I must disagree with You ! My friend is black , he and his whole family has blue gray and green eyes. Even non mixed humans with other races, as the Aboriginals in Australia most of them are dark skinned and have blue and green eyes 

Hihi silly you..You should have pay attention at school !!"
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG I CANT WAIT !
-egQ79OrYCs,i can't wait to see it
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol
heueheuhuhe
esse filme vai ser mto show"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i know that the show is asian influenced, but that doesnt mean the characters themselves are asian. LOOK AT THEM. no group of people on earth have dark skin, dark hair, and bright blue eyes. my problem with the casting is that they made the firebenders dark skinned, when they are supposed to be light skinned, and then made the water tribe light skinned, when they are supposed to be dark skinned. and they should give the firebenders colored contacts so they have gold eyes."
-egQ79OrYCs,...fail
-egQ79OrYCs,"So with this frame of thought, Superman can be Black because Metropolis is Fiction.  Peter Pan is now Aborigine because Neverland is a fictional place.  Harry Potter can be Latin because Hogwarts is fictional.  Seems to me the majority of fictional lands are are filled with Europeans when them get to Hollywood."
-egQ79OrYCs,This is gonna be a crappy dissapointment just like dragonball evolution
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ rawrs

i agree with you 100%...white kids shouldn't be playing asian/ethnic characters"
-egQ79OrYCs,"and at 1:06 i paused and took a look at Zuko....uh, pretty sure his face should be a little more fucked up then  that little nik under his left eye. Im also a little disappointed that in the 3 trailer that are out we still dont here Aang talk. This kid better not sound like a dork or a little girl....(sigh), but by the looks of it he probably will. o well still goin in with high hopes."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I can really go either way on this movie. Looooooove the cartoon and i hope they make the movie well. I'm going to stomach the fact M.Night changed the races of the characters (gay, he made the wrong people brown, in the show its katara and sokka and now they're the only ones who are white. and why are the rest of them Indian looking?? o well) The visual quality looks good so thats promising. But if Night put some gay twist in like they're all in some dream or weird fog then i will kick his ass"
-egQ79OrYCs,bad trailer...sum1 who doesnt watch the cartoon wouldnt know whats hapenning
-egQ79OrYCs,"for once.... just ONCE.
they could have used some older actors playing the roles. and now they have to be specific about it -.-"
-egQ79OrYCs,Just got goosebumps can't wait to watch this movie!
-egQ79OrYCs,The visual effects look really amazing!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm so excited about this! I really hope it's great, can't wait to see it :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont like the look of sokka
-egQ79OrYCs,I know that the show is based off of asian culture. But do any of the people on the show really look asian? That is my point. I just want people to stop complaining about the race of the actors.
-egQ79OrYCs,Nickelodeon
-egQ79OrYCs,"special effect ?? good ...
story ?? hope good too ...
fighting coreograph ?? dont hope to much ~_~"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Although Avatar is based on asian traditions and martial arts, the characters don't have to be asian, because, again its a fictional world. The director can do whatever he wants, he could have used asian actors, but he chose not to. It woudln't have mattered if he had chosen latinos, africans or americans, in the movie they dont belong to any of our world's entities. Katara in the movie is not european, she's a water nation native, she could be a European, but it doesnt matter in the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"basically this movie is just a couple of the cartoon's episodes with horrible looking portrayers and over the top effects that make it all look horrible!!!!!
omfg katara and zuko my fav characters suck now !!! how dare they ruin the show for me with this movie!
jasper looks like good tho he can pull it off i wish he were darker tho :("
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara isn't bad looking...
-egQ79OrYCs,"Reminder for all of you, Avatar takes place in a FICTIONAL world, so non of the characers can be asian because THERE IS NO ASIA!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,only thing i think is fucked up is prince zuku.. why he brown? are there slumdogs around in this movie dang
-egQ79OrYCs,"Eskimos are white, they can't be dark because of the weather, it's biologicly impossible."
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie is gonna be crap, they shoulda just use animation for the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,tru dat
-egQ79OrYCs,The real AVATAR
-egQ79OrYCs,"the real AVATAR!!!!

Cameron Sucks!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"but the characters are asian, doesnt matter if its annoying or not. fact is fact."
-egQ79OrYCs,that is such a crappy name for a movie
-egQ79OrYCs,Not racist. It goes the same way on many occasions. But Avatar was Mike and Brian's creation so I guess they along with the director just preffered not to have asain actors. I would have respected it either way. But juding by the trailer it seems that they are depserately trying to reel in some fans. Especially since the show ended.
-egQ79OrYCs,"tis an american show.
i honestly hate anime, but avatar is fantastic in my opinion.
i think it would be incredibly annoying if they were all asian."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sk8erkid6485 sure, specially bc all kind of literacy in avatar IS in english... you are a stupid and racist person."
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah but then we wouldnt be able to tell the characters apart. I dont mean that offensively but most avatar fans never even realized the asian culture behind the show. This makes things much easier to follow.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@twilight4evr7 the show is based off of asian culutre, dumbass."
-egQ79OrYCs,Why the fuck aren't they Asian?!!! This is like what happened to Dragon Ball Z
-egQ79OrYCs,wow this film is going to bomb for sure
-egQ79OrYCs,"the trailer looks pretty good, hope the movie is as well, but why is everyone saying that the cast is all white? i mean aang is white and so are the water tribe people, but most of the fire nation look to be of middle eastern origins, maybe each nation will look a certain way, they didn't show any earthbenders faces, maybe they will be asian."
-egQ79OrYCs,No kidding!
-egQ79OrYCs,I heard the Asian kid from Tropical Thunder was going to be the Lead role. But you know how Hollywood Politics goes.
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow!!! I thought most of them were Asian?..SMFH another F***ed up movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,Where's Katara's hair-loopies? *shot* XD
-egQ79OrYCs,"It actually doest make me racist to question why a movie obviously influenced by Asian culture, whose source characters read and write Chinese instead of English, where the religion is based on Buddhism and the action is based on Shaolin Kungfu and other chinese martial arts would get then cast caucasion children for the roles.  Hollywood stays true to source material when doing Peter Pan, the stories of Narnia, Superman so why stray when the source material clearly has minority lead roles?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Would you people shut up!? I think that when you complain about the actors not being asian-and note, who on Avatar actually looks asian?-it makes you racist. So just STOP. Race does not matter whatsoever, so who cares if they are white?"
-egQ79OrYCs,hope ayne isnt a pussy like in the series
-egQ79OrYCs,lol at everyone who seems to have a problem with aang not being asian... the creaters of avatar arent even asian.. nolan is an excellent aang from his fighting stances to his big ears.. cmoN people!.. who cares if hes not asian..
-egQ79OrYCs,"Christians do NOT complain about that.
And where did that come from?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Whelp more talented Asian kids out of work. Maybe this is a revolution that we are apart of and the role of Peter Parker/Spider-man  and Wonder Woman will go to Will and Jada's kids.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@thuntheduh
Amen"
-egQ79OrYCs,No. It does not.
-egQ79OrYCs,It is actually there. It's just hard to see.
-egQ79OrYCs,You can actually see Appa in the Super Bowl TV Trailer.
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie is based after book one. Toph does not come on until Book two.
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah! The Last Airbender is going to kick the crap out of Dragonball!
-egQ79OrYCs,they need to make Katara's hair loopies more distinct!
-egQ79OrYCs,"This supposed to be a trilogy.

So if they follow the anime, Toph would be in the second movie (the Earth Chapter)"
-egQ79OrYCs,man this looks really sweet ya know babey ya it it doed look  good o ya ya o ya
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant see Toph in this film...where is she? she played a vital role in the animated one..my god..this has to be good..
-egQ79OrYCs,that looks cool I wanna see it
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't think it matters what race is playing what. The only difference would be visually there's an Asian person playing a role; the acting is more than likely the same regardless. Anyways, my friend Seychelle is in the movie (Princess Yue) and she said the creators of the show were on set the whole time and they even had the cartoon playing to get it right. She said we'll be especially happy with the Kyoshi warriors :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Nagatai

Actually, it's more like the Fire Nation are Japanese, the Earth Kingdom are Chinese, the Airbenders where Tibetian, and the Water Tribes were Inuit/Eskimo."
-egQ79OrYCs,wow they got a lot wrong..oh well it still looks cool
-egQ79OrYCs,"Cast-wise, a BIG disappointment. Not to be racist, but isn't it the water benders that look more indian-ish and the fire nation is all white? Plus Zuko's scar doesn't look as disfiguring as it's supposed to be. Looks more like he got badly sunburned instead of scarred by a blast of fire."
-egQ79OrYCs,"omgggg! i wanna watch it! but dev patel as zuko, that makes no sense lol  :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,the whole DBZ movie was a fuck up big time
-egQ79OrYCs,looks pretty good
-egQ79OrYCs,it's a big budget movie. so I guess it's supposed to be good.
-egQ79OrYCs,"i have to agree guys, this movie has to be so good."
-egQ79OrYCs,simply amaseing!
-egQ79OrYCs,So your saying there are no asian actors in america?
-egQ79OrYCs,@Vezershus new flash: made in america not asian!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and the chars in avatar (besdies fire nation) do not look white
-egQ79OrYCs,"omg i llooovvveeeddd the series! and i cant wait for this movie 
i hope its good"
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheMikey95 becuz scars are supposed to look faint especially after one has had one for 3 yrs
-egQ79OrYCs,they coulda dun better with zukos scar u can barly tell he has one
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks a bit fat... lol but seriously y r there white ppl playing everybody except zuko... who i swear was white...
-egQ79OrYCs,"as always, trailer seems nice..but bull***t is always 'round the corner.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Lol all of M. Night Shyamalan trailers look good. The movies themselves are another matter. 

I'm holding out hope for this one. It looks like they weren't afraid to put money into it. I don't see how he could fuck it up."
-egQ79OrYCs,I am soooooo going to see this!
-egQ79OrYCs,so for that I think the cartoon sucked I loved it up untill the last episode but in all of that action I expected someone to shed blood or to die and I didn't like ang  hooking up with katara in the end I would have muched prefered zuko and katara being together. In fact that could have been symbolic too Fire nation and water tribe people uniting LOL instead zuko got with this emo girl with a ugly ass hair don't that aparently have had history together which never learned. I missed some episodes
-egQ79OrYCs,with ang taking the fire lords powers he should hav killed the motha fuka
-egQ79OrYCs,"I normally hate it when they make live movies out of ended cartoons and anime. But this time Im siked because Avatar sucked on so many diffrent accounts. I loved the fights yea but I hate how they managed to go the intire show without any blood shed or violence. Thats what you get for watching a nickolodeon anime. I mean even the ending episode failed. if Avatar was created by someone else, katara would have drownded azula zuko would have bleed when he got shot and it wouldn't have ended......"
-egQ79OrYCs,"waw,i taught this will be a bad movie,but there are some absolutely awesome effects there..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"you are the last of your kind, all that remains of a once powerful nation, you are the only one who can bring balance to the world that war, but some will stop it nothing to destroy you......."
-egQ79OrYCs,i know this is gonna be bad because they are going to put the seasons together and its going to be chaos :(
-egQ79OrYCs,Awesome. =D
-egQ79OrYCs,dude that's so awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,@Lockfreak123 I think it's because only the Monks and stuff have Arrows.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@rocked100b it's goign to be a trilogy, not just one film."
-egQ79OrYCs,is it just me or does princess yue look like denise richards!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I actually loved the show, and Zuko was hot in there. This ZUKO is not hot. And not even similar ti ZUKO... Doh...

Katara and her brother - both are nice in here. Good choice of those.

Trailer music is awesome. Anyone knows the title? :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,apart from the choice of actors everything looks fine... I'm looking forward to seeing it
-egQ79OrYCs,@ninjaguy4561 What? He looks somewhat like him
-egQ79OrYCs,"DISSAPOINTED!!!!
Rather watch the show."
-egQ79OrYCs,complete Nerdgasm!
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont see it....
-egQ79OrYCs,@edwardwright296 The point/upset is the fact that you shouldn't have to look really close :(
-egQ79OrYCs,they probably will be there cause im sure the kids are walking across the world from the south pole to the north pole
-egQ79OrYCs,someones  missing thats very important .......wheres momo and appa!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,whats that song called?
-egQ79OrYCs,"even still, it makes it a little more bad-ass."
-egQ79OrYCs,no joke this movie looks very good
-egQ79OrYCs,first off...aang is a little asian douche!! second katara is ugly! third sacka (i think i spelt that wrong) looks 20 and zuko? wheres the scar? i was excited about this movie at first but now i think night is going to ruin it completely
-egQ79OrYCs,@thuntheduh thank u.......
-egQ79OrYCs,"Course the question remains, why are ya whining about religion on a forum for a movie? And not even a religious movie. As for Indians being Asians yes they are. Though most people consider them Indians not Asians like they do Japanese and Chinese people."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, you can argue if Jesus was the son of God or not till your blue in the face, but he WAS a real person. There is Historical records of him, not just Biblical. If you wanna argue if person was real or not, do alittle research on the subject. Even most atheist who do research will tell you Jesus was a real human person."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wow, you people complain about the whitewashing of fictional characters more than Christians complain about the whitewashing of Jesus. Well, Jesus may very well be a fictional character as far as I'm concerned but thats besides the point. This is just a movie. Plus, Zuko was pale as fuck in the show and now hes Asian. Or do Indians not count as Asians to all you Japanophiles?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"no freaking way!!!! where is zuko's scar?!?!?!?! they can't cut it out!!! its really important!!! not only does it make zuko look super cool, but his own dad did it to him and its SO FREAKING IMPORTANT TO THE STORY!!!!!
oh my god!!! nooooo!!!!! they'll ruin it!!!!! =("
-egQ79OrYCs,@hagen552 he does. Look closely.
-egQ79OrYCs,"The zuko guy has no scar? thats retarded, o well, the movie does look AWESOME though"
-egQ79OrYCs,Ã© um otimo filme
-egQ79OrYCs,Hope this is better than that Dragon Ball Evolution crap!
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is my summary of the comment section.

""ZOMG, TeH peoplez skin colors is all RONG!!!"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"@619flyguy idk , i think they mess up the water tribe because they are pure white. all water tribe were dark skinner"
-egQ79OrYCs,"the movie is based on season 1, toph was not in season 1"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i know man!! that is what i'm telling everbody, they fucked up the best character in the series, man this movie is fucked."
-egQ79OrYCs,they fucked up the fire nation and prince zuko as well.
-egQ79OrYCs,"i feel you bro, me too, this movie is fucked up as a hindu curry eating bitch, which they put as the fire nation."
-egQ79OrYCs,"no, this movie is based on book 1 water"
-egQ79OrYCs,"why the fuck is the fire nation being played by a bunch of indains and iranins, man this movie is getting more messed up by the minute, the director said he got notes of people who said he was being races by only puting white causains in the film. i wolud tell the director to tell those credtitors to fuck off, juz white or asians will be required for this movie, not a punch of sish kabob fools, man they fucked this movie up big time, everybody in ma school is saying the same thing."
-egQ79OrYCs,wowoowowowowowow va estar hpta contra su recontraputisima madre esta pelicula la espero con aciassss s  sd fsdf sdf sdg dfg
-egQ79OrYCs,Omg how can they leave us hanging like this XD
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ya so when will they make some more episodes D:

I really wanna watch some new avatar episodes"
-egQ79OrYCs,im going to speak my opinion here like it or nt any1 whose seen the avatar episodes should know tht this movie looks like CRAP i know im judging it to early i do tht alot bt honestly the actor for aang looks terrbile the fighting parts look mediocre and i really dnt think they can put all of book 1 water into a 2 hour movie it really does look horrible bt then again thts just my opinion
-egQ79OrYCs,"the director of this movie isnt a failure , infact the sixth sense was had an intresting storyline , and also the movie ""The Happening"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"HOLY SHIT ! !!! I LUV AVATAAAR ! !!  O_O
Are they gunna make any new anime episodes?

The last epsiode stopped at Zuko asking where his muther was"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, that's only in the trailer, which is probably supposed to look bad-ass. I do hope that they make Aang at least a little goofy, or his whole character will be messed up. Shyamalan better not screw it up."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ash666emo Really, I think that what they did in terms of costumes is amazing. Yes, cosplayers have costumes that are much closer to the cartoon, but if they used those in a live action movie, it would look, well, like a live action movie trying to be a cartoon. This way, it looks more real, and it looks a heck of a lot better then it would if aang was wearing bright orange and yellow all the time."
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks just like the cartoon series! when was the last time u watched the show?
-egQ79OrYCs,"the cosplayers are have better costumes than the characters in this movie.they sucked at picking the casts they could've at least made the costumes look like the ones in the cartoon.i mean,is it so hard to follow the outfits the cartoon characters were wearing?it is that expensive to buy stuffs from ebay or buy off costumes from cosplayers?and what happened to Katara's hair loopies and her braid?oh and whoever's playing ozai,what is with the wig!did shyamalan steal that off the janitor's mop?"
-egQ79OrYCs,sure i'll watch the movie but it won't change a thing....i've hated this movie since i saw the casts
-egQ79OrYCs,"Zuko scar is small and faint,this trailer is not much different from the first one"
-egQ79OrYCs,Wheres prince zuko's scar
-egQ79OrYCs,WHAT THE CRAP IS THIS?!!!! avatar...the last airbender?...  i don't see any resemblance to the cartoon series but i do see it as the LAST i'll ever watch from his movies T_T this is definitely crap... i can't wait till it comes out so i can't mock it!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Not to mention Prince Zuko might be indian because the director of the movie is indian...Ha!
-egQ79OrYCs,"That's the trouble with cross national movies.  What nationality plays what parts?  The Last Airbender story was created by american white guys, about asian philosophy and martial arts. Things are going to get mish-mashed to satisfy this racially motivated country.  Why is Katara and Sokka  played by two white people, when they should be Eskimo or Inuit?"
-egQ79OrYCs,makes sence toph isnt in it shes from season two this look to be only based apon season 1 u /r/ tard
-egQ79OrYCs,Jackson Rathbone looks like a badass in this movie :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"AUGH. Where the hell is Toph?!

I can't believe she wont be in this!"
-egQ79OrYCs,lmao yea
-egQ79OrYCs,Earthbenders ftw! xD lols
-egQ79OrYCs,Shyamalan had better not fuck this up.
-egQ79OrYCs,i just had goose bumps watching this new trailer...
-egQ79OrYCs,"I wonder if Aang will be goofy like in the cartoon, because in this trailer, he looks all serious."
-egQ79OrYCs,This looks like an awesome movie. It better be as good as this trailer implies.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Naruke0 Its going to be a trilogy. M Night Shyamalan said that each movie is going to be each ""book"" of the series. Be happy about this, I think its a great idea to take this series in this direction."
-egQ79OrYCs,damn straight
-egQ79OrYCs,"Loved the show, but they got the cast wrong, we'll see if its actually as good as the original"
-egQ79OrYCs,Whut happened?! wtf just happened to Katara?! WHY THE HELL ARE THEY WHITE?! NOOOOOO D: and Ang's arrow thingys look weird
-egQ79OrYCs,looks like they got the same story line but not the same characters from the TV show. i mean the only reason i watched the Tv whos was for the Twitty stupid stuff Sokka did. i mean i didnt see any of that in this. and i agree with darktc . i dont think its gonna be as good as the TV show... but as always HollyWood did get the special effects down pretty good
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AGHHHH i am totally going to see this in July!!! I love that show and it is awesome they put realy people into it :3 shweet!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"NO, I'M PISSED TOO!! This guy should go chock on his brother's ****!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Good point. Thats bullshit!
-egQ79OrYCs,might as well put some girl under knives to make her look like katara.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, i actually only liked the first two. Didn't like the moral of the ending... and didn't like the fact that aliens came to a planet made 70% of the most deadly substance to them."
-egQ79OrYCs,"FreeMason04... well i suposse that Fire Nation being Indian doesn't have to do with Shyamalan being Indian, to me it seems a little fandom Mary Sue thing.

The trailer actually look quite well, but i don't have high hopes. Shyamalan is like one of the worst movie director ever to have lived."
-egQ79OrYCs,this is wrong and im asian who watched avatar as a young kid and sees this
-egQ79OrYCs,i know right he should be more asian.... so shoud saka and zuko
-egQ79OrYCs,They better make Iroh the kind-hearted awesome kickass person he is! And they better not make Zuko just this evil dude I mean Zuko is way more complicated than that! It was probably hard to find someone as skinny as Aang though. Katara is too whtie. And so is Sokka. They got it mixed up Aang is supposed to be white and they are supposed to be darker. But it's the other way around. Damn it this better be good they better not make it too serious! >:( There has to be SOME comedy in it...
-egQ79OrYCs,"I ask for the same thing. The Fire Nation weren't supose to be like ""China""? The actor that plays Zuko it is not well choose."
-egQ79OrYCs,this one actually looks like it might be quite good
-egQ79OrYCs,@pipkick JUDGEMENTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"WHY HOLY GOD WHY?! Are Katara and Saka WHITE?! In the show they are clearly an alaskan indian type of race. There is nobody(that I know of) in the show that is of europian decent.  And from what I see the acting is horrable. They seem wooden, it's  like they plopped  a couple of Barbie and Ken dolls in parkas in front of a camera and said just pretend you're eskamos.  And Judging on who they got for the director it's going to flop like a dead fish. Nickelodeon WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?"
-egQ79OrYCs,This trailer was sick i was out of my seat
-egQ79OrYCs,....are we gunna see Appa or momo?
-egQ79OrYCs,YES!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!
-egQ79OrYCs,you're so damn right!
-egQ79OrYCs,"next thing they are gonna show is that toph is a toddler. wow. just...

wow"
-egQ79OrYCs,"omygod! i want to seeeeee that movie, it look so amazing!"
-egQ79OrYCs,This movies gonna suck M Night Shaylakjhka made it.
-egQ79OrYCs,y not?
-egQ79OrYCs,what are you complaining about? either way you're still going to the the movie...
-egQ79OrYCs,Why they put a cross on his back :(
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks good not like dbz Americanolution
-egQ79OrYCs,ya la kiero verrr!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,DO WANT
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wait... so the two main good guys are white actors (when they were oriental-middle eastern in the anime series) BUTTT the bad, opposing force they keep as the middle-eastern natives.

And you think Shyamalan would have something to say."
-egQ79OrYCs,"""I see white people!""

The 6th Sense - M. Night Shyamalan

Or was that 'dead people'?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"hmmm.. I think..... that THIS movie
-this?
-yeah this, will be so epicfail, that the word epicfail cannot be used in other senteses then in this movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,why they couldn't make  dbz evolution so succesfull??
-egQ79OrYCs,"Because those movies are worth to watch.... This movie is directed by M.Night Shyamalan, the worst director in the history of film-making."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Amaysn09 No what they need to do is not make anime into into movies with actual human actors until they figure out how to do it right I honestly dont think this movie will be any good but I am keeping an open mind until I actually see it, I just hope they dont stray from the storyline"
-egQ79OrYCs,lmao all of you are judging this 2+ minute video and saying that it's ALL serious but most of those scenes (95%) are battle scenes from book one....I'm pretty sure Shyamalan had some sense to keep the lightheartedness of the story because that's Aang's signature trait. You ALL need to calm down...and those who are criticizing the actors especially the actor playing Aang are also wrong...how could you judge his performance based on...this? FAIL...
-egQ79OrYCs,"I just hope that it'll be accurate with the cartoon. One, to a previous comment, yeah I'm worried that Aang won't be as innocent as he was in the cartoon. This one looks to serious. And two, this should be a pretty badass movie. Hopefully nowhere near the quality of the DBZ movie. Sigh...they should really remake that."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think the movie will be really awesome in terms of the spectacle it will show.  However, I could already tell that this might be one of the worst movies of M. Night Shyamalan.  The casting was horrible.  The only cast that I think best suited the character is Dev Patel for Zuko.  But, I will still go and see it.  I think the element bending will be really cool."
-egQ79OrYCs,"What is the use of watching this film?! We already the story line! It's just a remake of Book One!

It's just Book One with cheesy CGI with actors who suck. M. Night Shyamalan is such a murderer of the arts."
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko's scar looks like a sad little birth mark. Who the fuck did his make up?!
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol because a plain blue arrow would look semi lame in real life i suppose haha
besides this new arrow doesn't look bad. i'm just upset with dev patel as zuko...-_-"
-egQ79OrYCs,"From this trailer, I'm not sure if it captures even that.  Isn't the cartoon a little more upbeat than this?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think the only reason why i wouldnt like this movie is because they seem to have taken everything that was light hearted in the tv show (ex: ang being a goof) and just made it strictly business, and im not cool with that lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,um... why isnt his arrow blue?
-egQ79OrYCs,"You can't expect real people to look like the cartoon characters, jeez. I'm sick of people judging so fast. Avatar is a CARTOON. The actors cannot look like cartoon characters. If you think they should look the same, stick to the cartoon. xD

Personally, I think it will be a good movie. Obviously different - 20 episodes into one movie. So a lot will change and be taken out.

What's important is it having the SPIRIT of Avatar the Last Airbender."
-egQ79OrYCs,would making a real life movie of kenshin rurouni be a good idea or just leave it as cartoon cause if they did it would be just good as this
-egQ79OrYCs,this reminds me of xiaolin showdown somewhat but cooler
-egQ79OrYCs,"The effects look pretty hot in this movie, but i think it is going be a bad movie and a waste of money because, none of the characters look right! Also what up with the words making a arrow, in the cartoon show it's just a blue arrow on his head!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TVANO12345 Actually, Katara's not black in the show, she's Inuit in comparison; basically an ""Eskimo"", when you compare to real world cultures and ethnicities."
-egQ79OrYCs,@AverageJoeRercords He does have the burn scar; it's just not over the top dark like in the animated version because that's not what a real burn scar would look like. It only looks that way in the cartoon so it's more presented.
-egQ79OrYCs,wow this looks really gay!!! i mean it looks like they tried to make a serious film out of a funny show. It is just not right man....
-egQ79OrYCs,"@pipkick No, just each book/season as its own film, it seems. So the first one would cover season one, or at least the vital plot points of it, movie two would continue, and the third film would in theory cover Book 3: Fire."
-egQ79OrYCs,so they are combining all the episodes into this one? that be really stupid
-egQ79OrYCs,"I heard that! I was shocked when I saw how Katara looked! I mean damn! its like all her dark tan is gone, save for the eyes! Was it really that hard to find a dark tanned girl and put blue contacts in her head!? And then Sokka!!!? (shakes head) This movie better be good."
-egQ79OrYCs,"i love the show and im exicted for this movie.
im just one of the people who gets excited whenever something new with a favourite series happens, and then gets disapointed.

im guessing this will by like percy jackson or eragon. good movie on its own, but affiliated with the original whatever then its bad in comparison
but thats just what i think"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Why is it that the Fire Nation is Indian and Sokka is white!!? I mean shouldn't it be more Asians with different tans? I hope this movie will turn out good, cause the last one they did based on anime (Dragonball Z) was so HORRIBLE that I nearly cut myself off from the anime it self!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i find it ffunny they had to change the name from avatar the last air bender to 
The Last Airbender because freaken Avatar took the name lol and i bet this is guna fail :\"
-egQ79OrYCs,"It reminds me alot of the dragon ball z movie. Meaning while the concept of the movie is awsome, the movie itself is going to be a huge failure. It just can compete with the cartoon."
-egQ79OrYCs,does anyone know the music name used?
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think the fire nation is a little too indian, but the movie will be sweet non the less"
-egQ79OrYCs,you mean why don't they get Asian actors to play Asian characters like sokka and katara oh right those two aren't Asian in fact no one in the show was to be Asian you have to be from Asia and the show take place in a fantasy world that resembles an east Asian wold besides the term Asian also includes some white people mainly those from Russia along with Prussians and Indians and many others so if your going to bitch about political correctness know what your talking about
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG ur right i saw him in the other trailer too. , now i just wanna see momo lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah i agree with u on that. i would have rather seen their true races like in the cartoon. like aang, he is a monk and wears a asian/indaian type outfit and his tattos in the movie look hindu looking and they cast a white guy. see that dont make no sense"
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf katara and saka are white
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm glad to see everyone else noticed how un-Aang-like Aang looks.

He shouldn't take things seriously more than once or twice in the entire first book...

Still, looks pretty awesome.  And some of the scenes look EXACTLY like the cartoon, which is a good sign."
-egQ79OrYCs,u know someone i totally 100 % forgot about who is in the 1st season and who i havent seen in the trailer or even heard anyone who will play him is JET! cuz he was in the 1st season and came back in the 2nd where toph didnt know who he was. now if jet isnt in this 1st movie or any of them that will be totally messed up. i mean he dont have to have a big part just something small
-egQ79OrYCs,"well it's only a trailer, so hopefully he will make a joke or 100 in the movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah i hope he will make a joke or atleast smile in the movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,Why doesn't Aang ever crack a smile in any of these trailers?
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow! this looks way better than I have been giving it credit for props for making me take back what I initially said.
-egQ79OrYCs,"If the actors are good, which I think they will be, then the fact that they are not the 'correct' race will not even matter."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Ansteven91 

The problem with trying to accurately cast actors to portray the ethnic race of the different nations is that each nation had an interracial mixture of citizens within itself. Ok well, the air nomads were all Tibetans and the water tribe was all Inuit, but the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation both had asians and white people alike."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@lostindaydreaming 

Are you dumb? Katara and Sokka aren't supposed to be black. They are supposed to be Inuit.

But yeah, the movie has been white washed... It isn't going to fail though. I guarantee this movie is going to make huge profits."
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm boycotting this movie. The series was so great because finally there was a diverse main cast. Katara and Sokka are suppose to be black or at least be brown skin. They whitewashed this movie. I hate this so much. I hope the move fails.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really love the show, but I don't know about this."
-egQ79OrYCs,looks like he does karate or something not wushu.
-egQ79OrYCs,Hollywood please start casting people with martial arts experience for MA movies. Kid doing Wushu doesnt know any. When will they learn?
-egQ79OrYCs,but I don't wanna :'(
-egQ79OrYCs,"Oh you are so Racist, you only have a light-furred labrador? Were is the brown one? Lol but really skin color is skin color who gives a fuck. Were all the same we all get mad sad fall in love shit fuck eat and die. Face it your all gonna die(some day)!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA"
-egQ79OrYCs,"So Zuko and his family arent asian? So his uncle is a white guy who has an asian accent? And Azulas Mom and dad looks pretty asian to me.
.... I have to say tho there was only one black kid in avatar, and he was shown only like 2 sec, thats fcked up."
-egQ79OrYCs,jackson rathbone as socca!! haha
-egQ79OrYCs,"wtf no one hair looks like it is supposed to in the cartoon. the guy playing aang isnt fully bald, zuko doesnt have his ponytail from the 1st season and katara's hair isnt supposed to look like that til the 3rd season. damn director"
-egQ79OrYCs,anybody know the song?
-egQ79OrYCs,@ferishia he does have the arrow but here it's composed of writings tattoed onto his head and body and not the solid arrow we used to see in the cartoons
-egQ79OrYCs,In my awesome opinuin Nicola Peltz is hot and it looks like a great movie and I give credit to the speacial effects!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"wtf, lame"
-egQ79OrYCs,yup im excited lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"They're not asian in the cartoon either fuck wad, how many asians have blue eyes (water) and really pale skin (azula and zuko)?  Get a clue ass face."
-egQ79OrYCs,"first of all homie, this aint dragon ball. second of all the creator of avatar were americans who blended east asian culture with a little usa cartoon style. third of all, dont jump to conclusion until you watch the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"lmao maybe you should watch the series or the trailer again before saying something like ""fucking racist""...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol, I'm going to watch it anyway. I think it looks pretty asome :]"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie is going to be gay..
  he not even asian....they fuck up the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"if you want asians, the firebenders are indians, india clearly belongs to asia, if you mean the waterbenders, they weren't asians to begin with, they were inuit, your comment on ""Fucking racist"" is just ridiculus, because someone is always going to say that, I could post a video of my light-furred labrador and people would call me racist for not having a black one. Finally, I'll get thumbs down from all the movie haters for expressing my opinion in a reasonable argument. thank you"
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie better be awesome.. And that kid better have some moves
-egQ79OrYCs,after 4 years n no avatar im so going to see that shit
-egQ79OrYCs,"fucking racist movie, the people arent evn asian, THANKS WHITE AMERICA!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"The bending effects looks like they will be pretty cool, but something about the guy who plays Aang seems like he isn't really capturing the fun and playful side of Aang, which is the majority of his character in the series. I'm a little worried...."
-egQ79OrYCs,I really need to know this song does anyone know he name of the music in this trailer.......by the way this movie is going to b pretty bad ass i didnt even watch the series but i am going to buy it so i could c what the fuss is about this cartoon must b pretty good.....but anyhoo i neeeeedddd to know the artist and the name of the song used in this trailer
-egQ79OrYCs,is it all of the books or just book 1
-egQ79OrYCs,"i don't understand why they let m. night shyamalan make this movie. he's awful. everything since the shining has been pure garbage. he's gonna ruin the franchise, and no one seems to care. the casting was good, but i guarantee the screenplay is bad."
-egQ79OrYCs,This looks like its going to be retarded...... I am disappointed. The girl and boy who are playing Katara and Sokka are so different from the original characters!
-egQ79OrYCs,how come zuko doesnt have the scar on his face from when he fought his father
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara looks like a tard
-egQ79OrYCs,"if you pause it, you can see it's made up of a bunch of arrows, though it does look like a cross at a quick glance..."
-egQ79OrYCs,is that a cross on his back?
-egQ79OrYCs,on 1:26 Aang did the matrix remix on they asses they wasnt even prepared!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Why am I getting a ""golden compass"" premonition from this thing?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm not sure about this movie quite yet. It looks a tad bit too serious. Some parts of the cartoon were hilarious! The screaming cabbage guy, Soka's foolery, some of the little conversations among the Fire Nation's troops.

That's what made the cartoon so great, it was serious and funny at the same time. And by funny I don't mean kiddy humor..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG I DIDN""T THINK ABOUT THATT!!!!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"he's there lol very faintly, 1:17"
-egQ79OrYCs,why is zuko afgani??
-egQ79OrYCs,i just hope the kid portraying aang is good and has done his hw on the character. i understand that the movie is supposed to be serious and whatever but he doesnt he show aang's free spirit and naiveness
-egQ79OrYCs,"Not sure if I like his tattoos, but at least they still look the same when they glow."
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara and Saka are inuit.  It is rather offensive that you think dark skin means black.
-egQ79OrYCs,Gj for addressing this issue. Dam whiners over there.
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang should have been a bit older, he looks like a 8 year old in this movie. though the marks look better than they do in the anime, they should have kept it the way it was and where the fuck is zuko's burn mark. a big portion of the anime is based on that mark."
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG i cant wait for this. And APPA is in it..im soooo excited. itf you havent seen appa click the last airbender super bowl trailer HD and look on the far right corner of 0:08- 0:09 you cant see his horns and his head and tail
-egQ79OrYCs,he is the only one hwo could shit in his mouth
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang didn't even crack a smile. Even if they we're trying to do a serious and epic kind of approach to it, they could've atleast made him act like a happy go with the flow normal 12 year old child!!! Unless they didn't show those bots in the movie, im sorry for this comment but still...The TV Series was funny and suspensal with action all at the same time."
-egQ79OrYCs,"OH MY GOSH
THIS MOVIE LOOKS SICK"
-egQ79OrYCs,I want the fat Iroh... and a other aang and suko!!
-egQ79OrYCs,i this is based off of book one toph didn't come in until book 2! Thus she will not be in until the second movie... Think hard before you post senseless comments and make blind accusations.
-egQ79OrYCs,I couldn't agree more. I am sick of this new brand of vampires.
-egQ79OrYCs,"it is a trilogy, they have already started work on book 2.  and nationality plays into the series, so hence it plays into the movie as well.  most of the talent is not well known... id say its worth a chance.  knight said he is devoting 7 years to the project if i recall.  ill take anything right now that isnt a harry potter or vampire flick for kids... that stuff is getting old."
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks like it could be decent. Or it could be about on the same level as the Dungeons and Dragons movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,that white haired girl kissing sokka and lying down in the water is yue
-egQ79OrYCs,Is that Jackson Rathbone playing Saka?
-egQ79OrYCs,hot trailer.
-egQ79OrYCs,the trailer looks good and it looks like this is going to be book 1 so they might make 3 movies all together i just hope they dont rip up the series
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks like the movie deserves a chance, though iÂ´m still afraid it might turn out to be a lame rip off of the series, just like dragonball. but at least this one has better actors (you shouldnÂ´t depent on nationalitys but on how good they do their job!)!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,who is jackson rathbone?
-egQ79OrYCs,"ASDJHASKJFHAIUEFHASJKDAJSNcNJSDHFGAS
SO EXCITED!!!! GHHHH"
-egQ79OrYCs,In my opinuin Nicola Peltz is hot in this trailer!! 8D
-egQ79OrYCs,"yup :P that's what people get for judging things waaay too early. For months I was shaking my heads, waiting for those people to eat their words."
-egQ79OrYCs,"My how the story has changed. Six months ago it was all ""Oh my god its M Night Shyamalan he's going to butcher it""... ""Oh my God they aren't Asian this is racebending""... and now you're all looking forward to it... Well I love saying I told you so, so... I told you so."
-egQ79OrYCs,jackson rathbone as sokka! this is more than i could hope for.
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol lol lol lol lol lol 
Zuko is the slumdog millionaire guy
lols lols
woah, they even have someone for Yu-ay, that moon princess chick"
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol
you are so right about that"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this actually looks pretty decent and not very dragonball like lol
only thing im picking on is that zuko doesnt have his burn how gay is that"
-egQ79OrYCs,agreed....
-egQ79OrYCs,Fire warriors are the coolest.
-egQ79OrYCs,THIS FILM IS COOL and AWESOME
-egQ79OrYCs,Does anyone know the name of the song playing in this trailer im dying over here to know it i need it!!!! anyone?
-egQ79OrYCs,"hmmm... acrobatics look chinese, cast... could be better. 
Hopefully, not another ""Dragon Ball"", no one wants another ""Dragon Ball"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"iLOVEthaaTRAILER! 
hopefully the movie's just as good (:"
-egQ79OrYCs,people  LEARN SOMETHING :; love the cast !!!! that what the got !!! and we get it now !!! SO I LOVEEEE IT TOO NOW ÂªÂªÂªÂªÂªÂªÂª
-egQ79OrYCs,=/ I dont think they used the right people for this movie..
-egQ79OrYCs,I hate the character playing Zuko.... Im sorry but Dev Patel was the wrong person to cast Zuko. His left eye scar is not even close to perfection just like the cartoons. This is gonna be a little disappointing. Hey! it had to be this director fucking things up.
-egQ79OrYCs,I REALLY hope this movie doesn't suck. Judging by the trailor it could go either way. I saw dragonball for the lolz but I don't want to have to make fun of Avatar...the show deserves better.
-egQ79OrYCs,the cartoon is better....
-egQ79OrYCs,the cartoon is better....
-egQ79OrYCs,"if you look really close Zuko does have a scar, the only issues is that it is very faint"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Sorry to tell you, it wasn't very clever. I really wasn't sure what your point was or what that had to do with my comment."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm not sure if that was supposed to be sarcastic or clever, but it really only came across as pointless."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The more I see of this the more I feel that they should have just left this series alone. This just does not look right, so much is wrong, from casting to effects. I'm going to go see it because of pure morbid curiosity but I'm really not expecting much."
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara is younger than Sokka.
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah but isn't Katar older than Sokka and where is Katara's hair loopies. I miss those
-egQ79OrYCs,0:28 they got sokkas look spot on
-egQ79OrYCs,this is going to be hard
-egQ79OrYCs,@landicon and at least the play had toph. D:
-egQ79OrYCs,"@chevereguy Wth, they're not putting Toph in it? The hell, she's like one of the coolest characters... she freakin' teachs aang earthbending. I hate when movies change and ruin the main stories."
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf Katara was clearly black.
-egQ79OrYCs,aangs face looks weird.
-egQ79OrYCs,where's appa?
-egQ79OrYCs,no no i mean in the play he's played by a girl. i meant at least he's played by a boy in the movie. XD
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm getting tired of Hollywood stealing asian games (and animes) and casting every race but asians. Fire nation was definitely chinese even if the cartoon itself was made in america :|
-egQ79OrYCs,"@landicon I know what you mean; I bet this will be about as accurate, too!"
-egQ79OrYCs,XD at least Ang is a boy?
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks interesting, can't wait."
-egQ79OrYCs,"can someone tell me the song..
i really like it.PLZZZZZZZZ!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,after watching this many many times....i noticed there was no indication of an appa in this movie....he is vital to the success of the avatar franchise
-egQ79OrYCs,"Just 1 thing to this movie...

EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC"
-egQ79OrYCs,i love the tv series of this :)
-egQ79OrYCs,"haha, that episode is sooo funny :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,pleeeeeeeeeeeeease be good. not like m. night shyamalam's previous movies.
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope the Cactus Juice will be still in the movie.. i will wait for book 2 . :D
-egQ79OrYCs,LMFAO!!! Zuko is a freaking indian!!! hahahahahaha...wow this is gonna b another dissapointment just like DBZ was -.-
-egQ79OrYCs,This Zuko is very hot
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie will be shit without the screaming cabbage guy!
-egQ79OrYCs,oh man its already being compared to avatar... James Cameron spoiled all of you.
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm so excited!
-egQ79OrYCs,It looks ok the graphics are ok nothing like avatar's ^__^ that stunt in 1:25 looked gay
-egQ79OrYCs,Pretty good other than the cheezy stunt at 1:25
-egQ79OrYCs,I can't wait to see the movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,some parts of this movie seem retarded
-egQ79OrYCs,whaqts the name of the song someone pelase reply
-egQ79OrYCs,they picked the worst actors for the movie
-egQ79OrYCs,deng look at all those sak yant on his body
-egQ79OrYCs,(sighs) It's spelled lemur
-egQ79OrYCs,Who did that awful casting job
-egQ79OrYCs,"GUYS, it's ONLY a trailer, it's not going to reveal every single thing in about 2 minutes, it's made to give you a glimpse of the movie. The movie may not be 100% exact as the cartoon/anime, no movies are."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yes it does look great... but its not how the movie looks... its all about how the movie relates to the series... I also watch the series... but I just hate it how they mess up a good series into movies... they change alot of stuff out.... I didn't see Momo, or even Appa..."
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG<3 i cired
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow, this just looks horrible, how are they gonna fit a whole series into a crappy movie, oh and the fighting looks like shit"
-egQ79OrYCs,can't wait to see this movie! Its never gonna be the same as the original though!
-egQ79OrYCs,(sighs) It's a leamer.
-egQ79OrYCs,"why does it feel liek they gonna ruin the whole thing?
i mean, if thats supposed to be zuko at 1:07, there wasnt even a scar! and his uncle didn't even look old!

i REALLY don't think im gonna watch this movie!"
-egQ79OrYCs,idiot film clash of the titans>the last airbender
-egQ79OrYCs,"That is very true. It just bothers me i guess when people put down a movie already when they havent seen the whole movie yet. Its like, shut up already and dont say a thing until the movie comes out, THEN you could say wat u want."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@narutofan1491 
In almost all cases: the trailer is better than the film.
And just look at how Dragonball Evolution turned out, 
The trailer was crap, the movie was bad beyond words."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@smokeybaconlove I'm so glad I read your comment first because i was just about to say the same thing. Although, I AM a huge fan of the show, but M. Night Shyamyamyamaeck is seriously going to fuck this up, like he does everything else."
-egQ79OrYCs,"dude, it's not just chinese.
the name of the show is AVATAR which is a sankrit word.
and ""agni kai"" -- Agni is the Indian god of fire. 
just two of the many examples of non chinese references in the show."
-egQ79OrYCs,"You know what I dont understand is, why are a lot of you people saying its horrible, when you have not even seen the movie yet. Do not go around saying it is horrible when you have not seen the movie. Honestly thats ridicoulus. Yes, the cast may not fit the actual characters, but we cant say anything until we see the movie. We cant anything till the movie comes out. Damn some of you people need to ease down on the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Middle Eastern and Indian.

And Shaymalayan is Indian...how can he be racist against Asians when is he one."
-egQ79OrYCs,I had hope for this film until i heard that Nickelodeon was producing. They shoot everything to shit. Just look at the Series Of Unfortunate Events movie. And M Night Shyamalan sucks dick at all movie making.
-egQ79OrYCs,I dont think that the movie will be better than series. And is there will be Zuko's unckle?
-egQ79OrYCs,"zuko IS ASIAN.
Dev Patel is Indian
India is IN ASIA.
shockingly enough."
-egQ79OrYCs,"hey people whats the name of that song in this trailer , especially the rock entrance at 1.00 is awesomeeee"
-egQ79OrYCs,01:24 - Huge Cumshot!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Where is appa ? one important charactor man momo also sadness
-egQ79OrYCs,if this movie is disappointing i really think i'm going to go and hurt somebody
-egQ79OrYCs,"@georgiapacific  Dude, the people in the show are not asian, their CULTURE is asian. big difference."
-egQ79OrYCs,"uhmmm..yeah, why is half the cast white? wasnt the characters  in the series in nickelodeon suppose to be some kind of asain...and zuko? wtf?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"uhmmm..yeah, why is half the cast white? again im just repeating my self LOL"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@bmw5234 im surprised they even made the cartoon look bad

its gotta be hard to make a live action movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"yea, i agree, the movie looked not so great at 1st but this trailer made it look somwhat better, but if they stick to the original story from the animated seires and tha chars keep their personalitys, then the movie will be epic >:3"
-egQ79OrYCs,"yea, and if they dont put in the parts where they went to the library in the desert, that would suck cause thats like the best filler episode xD tho that was in book 2 so it would be in the 2nd movie since this is obviously book 1 :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,"but Iroh is searius when he needs to be :P so maye we jus saw a part where hes being serius insted of ""happy, tea loving"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"after seeing this it looks like they are sticking to the original story from the animated seires, this is a good thing, so this movie better be pretty f*cking epic >:D jus wish the actors/actresses looked more like the characters from the show :/ and from the looks of it, this will cover everything we need to know about Book 1 Water, so if this movie does good enough i bet we can expect a sequal abuot Book 2 earth and then Book 3 Fire :3"
-egQ79OrYCs,"It's hard to make wind look bad ass, being able to see it at all is a plus lol."
-egQ79OrYCs,jaja
-egQ79OrYCs,anyone know the song??? It's NOT ''In a Heartbeat'' so don't tell me it is.
-egQ79OrYCs,"The cartoon will still remain the best.
I feel the movie is going to be bad."
-egQ79OrYCs,@xXFluffyraverXx 1. Aang is 12-years old in the original story 2. they obviously changed Aang's markings on purpose (the movie doesn't have to be fucking exact) 3. you're going to watch this movie anyway despite saying otherwise
-egQ79OrYCs,"@iFeedMyDingoBiscuts You DO realize that Indians are from Asia and are therefore Asian, right?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Awesome!
-egQ79OrYCs,This doesn't look that good >>
-egQ79OrYCs,"Actually those are the four elements of western mysticism. Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water are the five Chinese elements."
-egQ79OrYCs,"arent the brother and sister supposed to be indian looking while zuko is supposed to look white. did he get that confused?

and o yea ill be seeing Nightmare on Elm street. that looks hella good"
-egQ79OrYCs,"since I am all into halloween stuff, and scary stuff and a monster, I am going to watch the new elmstreet, but why did you bring that up on here? wrong movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,this is going to be soo cool but where is tuffff
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ScreamoApparatus Actually, I heard (and correct me if I'm wrong) that the four used are ancient Greek elements, because the ancient Chinese ones are water, earth, air, metal, and wood, or something like that."
-egQ79OrYCs,soooo excited!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,They better actually have Apa and Momo or im gonna be super ticked
-egQ79OrYCs,EFFIN A! never noticed him there! sweet looks like they may have kept him with a similar look to the toon. awsome
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope they explain what happens to Azula a little more. Maybe show Zuko finding his mother
-egQ79OrYCs,"I want to see what Apa and momo look like, if they even put them in this. If they don't the movie is ruined right away."
-egQ79OrYCs,oooh this looks so amazing holy shit I'm so excited for this movie!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"How the hell did they pull this one off? Of course, I was wondering the same thing about the movie Avatar, but this looks awesome!"
-egQ79OrYCs,i'm gonna puke. i hope this movie burns in hollywood hades... (as well as Shamylan -_-)
-egQ79OrYCs,Omgosh I am soooooooooo happy I love the series ever since I to stumbled on it one day and now it had this great director making I into a movie I could die right now but then I would not get to see the movie!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Make that two in a million. I feel exactly the same way about them trying something different. I love the series, and have ever since I stumbled onto it by accident.

I also love the tattoo. I had been wondering how they were going to pull that off...^_^"
-egQ79OrYCs,hes indian
-egQ79OrYCs,uhmm..isnt the characters from the original story suppose to be some kind of asain? Zuko especially.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Okay, so Aang is Caucasian. I can see that. But the fire nation in the cartoon were clearly Chinese by the looks of the characters and their fighting styles and their technology. The Water nation was clearly some kind of Eskimo ethnicity...Siberian...Native American...but not white.

The only nation that seemed they could be American influenced is the Earth nation. I could see Toph being Caucasian."
-egQ79OrYCs,I am soooooo excited about this movie!!! It's going to be amazing!
-egQ79OrYCs,"The one who is playing as Katara is so effin' ugly. 
Anyone agree?

And..holy shit that looks cool. Aang looks like he is 8..not 12. D:"
-egQ79OrYCs,what the fuck is this?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Where are the good scripts anymore?
pure bullshit! Avitar another piece of crap.
Digital has its place, but Holly-lunes thinks good Didg can replace good writing.
M. night should stick to his own shit at least I'm amused.
if it gets any worse I'm gonna start reading all the books I've been hoarding."
-egQ79OrYCs,UHHH IM SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,wow u arent very smart
-egQ79OrYCs,appas in the super bowl trailer top left corner bout 10 or 15 secs in
-egQ79OrYCs,appas in the super bowl trailer top left corner bout 10 or 15 secs in
-egQ79OrYCs,"noah ringer is 12 like aang in the cartoon, katara cries through half the show, those markings on aang are sick and im sure the creators of the cartoon would have put them on him but it wud of been a pain to animate, zukos scar looks more realistic if they made it super dark it would look stupid in a real movie, i agree sakka does look like a pansy, appas in the super bowl trailer top left corner bout 10 or 15 secs in and momo is confirmed to be in it"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Why is almost the entire cast white?  I've always imagined Katara and Sokka to be like Native Americans or Eskimos or Black even, not white.  And Aang?!  C'mon now.  He's suppose to be of some Asian heritage.  Especially Zuko and Azula.  Although the element bending looked pretty awesome."
-egQ79OrYCs,yes he does
-egQ79OrYCs,appas in the super bowl trailer top left corner bout 10 or 15 secs in
-egQ79OrYCs,aang does look white in the cartoon! everyone argues with me bout that
-egQ79OrYCs,super bowl trailer top left bout 10 or 15 secs in
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG. Is Momo even in this?!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Lol ikr??
-egQ79OrYCs,"Avatar has influences from Japan, China, India, and Inuit cultures, just to name a few..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm not Asian, but this is an Asian based cartoon! I didn't see a single Asian person..."
-egQ79OrYCs,NO APPA... WTF .
-egQ79OrYCs,this movies looks lame. ): and why arent the kids asian? last airbender is japanese.
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks cool. everyone else mehh
-egQ79OrYCs,this is going to be the # 1 movie in the world
-egQ79OrYCs,"duuuude i fucking miss this show, why cant the movie come out sooner???"
-egQ79OrYCs,"White-washed, hollywood bullshit."
-egQ79OrYCs,"hmm, seems kinda cheap, and the effects dont look as good as they could, but we will see when it comes out hm?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"lame
isnt the air bender supposed to be funny, care fear and loving and all that good stuff
gah what a way to ruin a good cartoon and such"
-egQ79OrYCs,I am going to see this!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,is that tofh looks so like a boy i thought she was a girl at 1:19
-egQ79OrYCs,yes they better and momo
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko's not mexican
-egQ79OrYCs,"ikr i was thinking the  same thing ""my cabages!!"""
-egQ79OrYCs,how there going 2 fit the whole thing into one movie is beyond me
-egQ79OrYCs,"the effects look decent, but the actors for Sokka, Katara, and Zuko completely butcher them >:I"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Agreed. It's a damn 2nd degree burn, that crap will heal in a month"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Seems promising. I sure hope it turns out well-- the series deserves it.
        A minor nitpick: is it just me, or is Zuko's scar kind of....small?"
-egQ79OrYCs,I agree. But i still want to see it.
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks awesome o: Though I wish Dante Basco could've been in it. He's perfect for Zuko <3
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie is stupid its going to fail like dragonball evolution. the director was stupid enough to not cast asians they're asian not white -_-

racebending . com"
-egQ79OrYCs,"it looks interesting, im intrigue in how they are going to pull this off. and i kind of agree, ang looks way too young and dull, but i do like this katara."
-egQ79OrYCs,that last part after teh avatar state looked liek a scene from 2012 LOL
-egQ79OrYCs,"ok wtf. aang is waay too young, zuko should actually look asian, katara is like *shivers* i dont even have a word to describe her, and UGH. They completely butchered the movie.. the show is SO MUCH BETTER."
-egQ79OrYCs,What? there's no 666 anywhere.
-egQ79OrYCs,"they could have been closer to the plot on the discovery of aang. iroh should be fat, where is zuko's scar???? aang looks funny there. they need a boy whos a lil taller, more flexible, and whiter. i like his arrows though. one thing, my bending looks better than the bending these guys are doing. they are trying to make it look pretty, bending isn't supposed to look all pretty its sposta do what it must do. is aang a dustbender? airbending should look more real. and thats my rant. lololololololol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yes yes, Appa will be in it, they said that you'll have to wait to see him on screen :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"No, there's no 4th season..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Not liking the arrows on Aang.


I'm also afraid he'll loose his boyish cute charm

D,:"
-egQ79OrYCs,"flying hippo??! lmfao. your an idiot! :D
it's a flying bison u stupid dip shit!!!
and it won't be called Avatar The Last Airbender, just ""The Last Airbender"" :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,what HAPPENED TO THE FLYING BISON?????? i think they ran out of budget :))
-egQ79OrYCs,the little kid looks like a little bitch i want 2 punch him 4 some reason when i look at his face
-egQ79OrYCs,I wonder what Appa will look like XD
-egQ79OrYCs,this is going to be bad.... i can just tell. me and my friend have seen every episode of the series... i have a feeling this is going to ruin it
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yes, because it would be such a crime if a movie based off of a Nickelodeon show would be rated PG."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Katara is a lot younger in the movie than in the show but it makes sense because having such a huge age gap between them is a lot more pronounced in live action. In the show, their age difference is no big deal."
-egQ79OrYCs,that was one chubby as baby playin aang
-egQ79OrYCs,Cool story bro
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Metalscavenger 

Yeah, but WTF, did you see Zuko?!

1:07 

The actors might as well be Bruce Campbell for Aang and Danny Devito for Sokka, it would makes just as much sense! -___-"
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks like shit
-egQ79OrYCs,if this movie is any good my guess is that there is gonna be a continuing sequal kinda like the lord of the rings triligy
-egQ79OrYCs,"all i have to say is.... his tattoos look cool, if they are tattoos, the point is.. they look cool"
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie's gonna suck :)
-egQ79OrYCs,"UGH!! They always fuck it up with movies!! First of all, when they were fishing, they were on a fucking boat.. not on foot... damn... second of all, the tattoos are henna style tattoos.. if u look at the cartoon... its just a plain arrow..."
-egQ79OrYCs,hell yeah im goin to see it in chicago IL downtown wats good anybody goin
-egQ79OrYCs,"Actually
Aasif Mandvi aka Zhao is Indian and Shaun Toub, aka Iroh is Iranian
and you saying that Asians can't be pale is just ignorant
This movie is racist, and you all are just too blind or ignorant to see it.  People looking the other way and saying that things like this are not wrong are the reasons why racism has gone on so long in so many different forms.  I have to pay attention to this because obviously no one else will.  For the record I'm not Asian, I just know wrong when I see it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"i'm sorry, but the casting just looks like shit."
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:21 look at aang i the background, i think that thing right by him on the left must be momo"
-egQ79OrYCs,Movie looks pretty sick xD
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sutoraihu
I don't know, but don't you think it has something to do with the sci-fi called 'Avatar'?  ;)"
-egQ79OrYCs,@sutoraihu because james cameron was going to sue them because he already had the name avatar for his new movie
-egQ79OrYCs,why did they drop the word avatar in the title?
-egQ79OrYCs,Cool.
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm just waiting to see how Shamalama-ding-dong screws the pooch here.
-egQ79OrYCs,"i have to say im actually impressed from what has been seen, but u cant start critizing it now cuz u havent seen the full thing yet and also, he has to compress 10 hours into 2 for this movie. yet i highly disagree with their cast choices for Zuko and Iroh. 1. Iroh supposed to be fat and have a beard, not tall and skinny, and 2 he has lighter skin color, 3. they couldve at least TRIED to make zuko LOOK like zuko. the scar and hair are way off, and u can barely see the scar.  did good for sokka"
-egQ79OrYCs,If M Night screws this one up... Well lets just say that when he leaves his house to go to work he better run with his head down.
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks realy crapy. from trailers i can guess at the best this movie can get is to be as bad as dragonball evo. Aang stupid, im not talking about general Iroh thats a total fail."
-egQ79OrYCs,Awesome...and well as far as I'm watchin...the only one that I think that it's not so alike to the character is Zuko...I think that the original character looks a bit more...older...and a lil bit Katara but anyways I dnt mind of that as soon as is a gd movie and that it sticks to the series I bet it would be cool!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Maybe he'll get it somewhere in the movie, did you ever think of that?"
-egQ79OrYCs,This looks amazing LOL..
-egQ79OrYCs,casting sucks
-egQ79OrYCs,Look sweet!!
-egQ79OrYCs,I WANT TO SEE IT BADLY!!
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm an avid fan of the series but I'm afraid this'll end up like Dragonball.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Five stars for the REAL AVATAR! I can't wait for this movie! Appa can be seen in the first trailer, and Zuko's scar is more subtle and ""realistic"" in this movie. You can see it in the pictures. I'm pretty sure this movie only focuses on Book One: Water so, not Toph yet."
-egQ79OrYCs,This is going to be  season 1 all crunched into a real-life movie which means we have to wait for Toph in Last airbender 2 or 3
-egQ79OrYCs,I can't believe Jackson Rathbone is in this. o_o
-egQ79OrYCs,"this is the REAL avatar, but its still fail cuz have no appa <.<"
-egQ79OrYCs,ansiouxxxx
-egQ79OrYCs,GO JACKSON WHOOWOHOOOO!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,were the hell is appa he is like  one of the coolest animals in the cartoon along with momo
-egQ79OrYCs,the bisanÂ´s name is Appa
-egQ79OrYCs,apa
-egQ79OrYCs,Hey dumbass. Look who can't spell 'know'.
-egQ79OrYCs,"So every movie based on a cartoon or book is boring?
Can't wait to see your movie collection xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,@pspgamer01 then stfu
-egQ79OrYCs,I fucking have to see this movie! =D
-egQ79OrYCs,shamamalan is fooling you! i also think the trailer makes it look decent.. and i won't hold my hopes high.. but shamamalan disappoints every time..
-egQ79OrYCs,don't know if i would call dragonball evo a movie.. but more like career suicide..
-egQ79OrYCs,ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... nah... this iroh looks like he shouldn't even be there.. plus iroh is supposed to be fat.. if they make sequels i wanna see how they achieve his captive time goin from fat guy to buff badass fire guy
-egQ79OrYCs,where the hell are the hair loopy's?!
-egQ79OrYCs,technically yes it is animated in korea.. but it is still an american animation. like i don't know where teen titans was animated but it took a lot of its animation style for anime but its still an american cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,not an anime.. but yea they could've casted better
-egQ79OrYCs,2 sequels.. there's only 3 books
-egQ79OrYCs,big ass flying bison with like 6 legs.. and a bowl cut.. sounds retarded.. but the cartoon makes appa the shit..
-egQ79OrYCs,watch the cartoon.. you'll wind up much happier
-egQ79OrYCs,true.. someone get this kid a hooker! maybe he'll crack a smile
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko is indian because shamamalan loves street fighter.. and he sees dhalsim spit fire.. so he figured why the hell not? OR its because shamamalan is a dumbass.. i'lll let you choose
-egQ79OrYCs,iroh should also be fat and bald... such a let down.. everyone knows fat people bring in comedic relief and happiness..  just the way iroh did in the show..
-egQ79OrYCs,wonder if they'll stick foamy guy in this somewhere.
-egQ79OrYCs,"makes sense.. i think i do remember them sayin in the show ""we have to go to that other island off china"" or ""we have to go to the fire section in china"" ""no lets go to that other chinese water tribe on the other side of the china world""...."
-egQ79OrYCs,the actor for suko is realy not the right choice
-egQ79OrYCs,matter of fact its how he gets his haircut regualrly
-egQ79OrYCs,nope kid actually shave the dome for this
-egQ79OrYCs,I've seen the Avatar-cartoon-anime...It was awesomeee...and I still do...But I can't belive they did a movie...XD I have to watch it...XD
-egQ79OrYCs,i think i read that if this one does good they will prolly sign up for the sequels.
-egQ79OrYCs,technically not anime.. but yea shamamalan makes whack ass movies.. also yes.. some of the special effects already look stupid.. like the fire stuff does not look intimidating at all..
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks white as a ghost in the cartoon.. and i do agree about the water tribe tho.. at least spray them brown.. and yea the fire nation should totally be asian..
-egQ79OrYCs,"i thought the same thing, i was like WTF i cant believe they did that"
-egQ79OrYCs,i think this movie would have been even better if they matched the character right to there race.
-egQ79OrYCs,and damnit uncle iroh is supposed to be FAT.. i mean how are they gonna pull off the part where iroh gets all hub and cut while he's captive? the casting for this movie sucks.. they coulda at least made the actors playin katara and sokka get tanned... and clumdog zuko? really? hell i woulda gave dante basco a chance to at least try out for his role as zuko.. but this does look better than majority of the shamamamalan movies... meaning everythin after unbreakable..
-egQ79OrYCs,looks 1337
-egQ79OrYCs,Too bad they couldn't call it avatar xDDD it would've been funny as hell
-egQ79OrYCs,"People need to stfu about the asian thing.. it's a fictitous world there are no asians but at the same time he should have gotten people that at least somewhat resemble the characters, zuko and katara look nothing like the show, Aang does... but the rest are garbage."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm not watching this movie because it's racist.  Anybody who doesn't see it is blind.  I'm not just saying that because Aang is white, oh no, and not even because all of the water tribe is white as well, no.  The thing that pushes it over the edge is that the fire nation, the universally received bad guys, are all middle Eastern, the ONLY asians, or even non-white people in the whole damn movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,his movie is going to suck appa's balls. like it will literally fail epically
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol yeah fail,"
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie is really good but wheres appa and momo
-egQ79OrYCs,Why isn't Aang asian? -_-. fail.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I cant wait for this movie xD
Watch my video to find out something really cool about the internet!"
-egQ79OrYCs,LOL KATARA HAS A HUGE NOSE XD
-egQ79OrYCs,"the picks for the actors are just such a mismatch to the actual series,  i aint saying anything about their skill though, really hope they dont mess up the story"
-egQ79OrYCs,"O.O

como que Katara y Zokka son blancoos??"
-egQ79OrYCs,Avatar state = auto gg
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah... there are too many differences. I don't think I like this casting. D:

I don't think anyone likes it though when Hollywood eff's things up and isn't faithful to w/e they're making a movie on. :("
-egQ79OrYCs,looks ok
-egQ79OrYCs,appa is dead.
-egQ79OrYCs,@xXUrbanCamoXx Trilogy
-egQ79OrYCs,holy shit that looks kick ass
-egQ79OrYCs,"it doesn't look like its gonna b that bad but i guess we won't kno til it comes.

but i wonder, how are they plannin on doing the whole series in just one movie? or is it gonna b a trilogy like the books?"
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie going to be sick!
-egQ79OrYCs,"goddamnit Shyamalan, you just killed this movie, mainly because the cast selection is all wrong"
-egQ79OrYCs,TOO LATE D:
-egQ79OrYCs,it was definately based on the cartoon.. there are scenes and lines from the cartoon.. can be any more based than that.
-egQ79OrYCs,Whow BROSKE!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@bongoj94 

fine for the nerds I will say ""animation"""
-egQ79OrYCs,@romeization its the main character's flying bison. Which looks like a HUGE ass white furred Buffalo. =]
-egQ79OrYCs,"oh god, not m. night shyabladahblah... rofl"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Me to Appa is the best flying bison, Even if he is the only flying bison!"
-egQ79OrYCs,lol when i first heard of Avatar (great movie by the way) i thought it was the cartoon one from nickelodeon
-egQ79OrYCs,@CheeseMusket who the fu** is Appa
-egQ79OrYCs,ive never seen the cartoon but this makes me wanna see the movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"It is not an anime dude, made in the USA, it is just that the art work is inspired by anime!"
-egQ79OrYCs,so is this going to be like the first book like the water chapters up to the rebellion up at that one place
-egQ79OrYCs,"Awsome, the Blue Spirit 0:46"
-egQ79OrYCs,that's true. good point. btw. live-action DBZ was the worst crap I've ever seen. they totally murdered all the awesomeness that was dbz
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko ad hes uncle  shoold be asian!!! they killeed it....
-egQ79OrYCs,"Doesn't that defeat the purpose though? Zuko's scar was always completely visible, it was his trademark ....mark.... so to have a photogenic scar really doesn't complete his character.... Zuko's scar should be more noticeable. I hope he does plan to make the scar look better..."
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks really promising
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko has a tiny scar lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"ohhhh ok thanks update me if you know!
:)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Maybe it is just me, but did anyone notice that Prince Zuko didn't have his burn mark on the side of his face?"
-egQ79OrYCs,@ModernGaara: the guy thats playing katara actually sounds the same
-egQ79OrYCs,ok now this looks better then the last one lol.btw does anyone know the music name used ?
-egQ79OrYCs,They casted aang way too young. He's supposed to be like 12 or 13 and he lookes more like 7 in here.
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie looks extremely faithful. They even have appa and princess yue. I can't wait to see it
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG
cant wait. :X"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah I agreed, he doesnt look like the anime one, its too serious."
-egQ79OrYCs,i agree they shouldve made it more like the anime
-egQ79OrYCs,Gay....Feels nothing like the anime.
-egQ79OrYCs,"From the looks of it, this is only the first volume starting in the southern water tribe.  I guess there will be three more sequels."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Zamensis
thank u for sayin that he was talkin about tattoos cause i didnt and i kno that not evry cartoon isnt american cause i watch and a fan of japanese anime so apparently i kno that. Nutshell."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Zamensis
didnt kno he was talkin about tattos so sorry and i dont belive that because i do watch and a fan of japanese anime sherlock."
-egQ79OrYCs,ew o-o i bet they messed up a ton of this ;\
-egQ79OrYCs,"ya quiero que salga 

hahaaahahahaha"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think I actually didn't hate Lady in The Water, but I was a freshman (high school) when I saw it. I saw the Village, didn't mind it, but on a guess, I figured out the modern times thing within 10 minutes of the movie. And the happening sucked. Unbreakable was good, as was Signs, those are his two best movies."
-egQ79OrYCs,This is going to be teh best moovie everr
-egQ79OrYCs,"Realy?This is sad,a fricking MOVIE??????"
-egQ79OrYCs,I wish the people looked more like their animated counterparts.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@CristopherOS
the cartoon is an amercan animated series go look it up for yourself."
-egQ79OrYCs,I love them.
-egQ79OrYCs,Avatar was made by two Americans in Universal's Nickalodeon studios...
-egQ79OrYCs,the tatoos SUCK!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Such bullshit.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@naruto36 
it is korean"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@dingoandthebaby 
beacuse they are death!!!
buahahaha"
-egQ79OrYCs,avatar is not japanese anime and they should have made aang older.
-egQ79OrYCs,WHHHYYYYY is there noo appa and momo???
-egQ79OrYCs,"the movie looks alright, and i think that the guy who is playing zuko could do a good job, but he looks nothing like the guy"
-egQ79OrYCs,Finally I think M Night actually does something right.
-egQ79OrYCs,id have to say iro looks badass!
-egQ79OrYCs,thank you!! and i think this movie is gonna be pretty decent myself.
-egQ79OrYCs,WTF is wrong with katara!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"oh my god, you guys are gonna bitch and complain because the actors are messed up, or they wont be able to tell a whole story in one movie. thats what sequels are for, and as for the actors, who cares. i for one think this movie is gonna be badass, and i am definately gonna go watch it in theaters. and btw, i dont give a damn it i made spelling errors....so fuck you people that have a problem with people who dont spell stuff right."
-egQ79OrYCs,"you can't tell the whole story in one movie...
its gonna be lame"
-egQ79OrYCs,I just don't feel comfortable trying to watch live action for a cartoon/ attempt at anime. Plus the fact the actors are messed up for the characters
-egQ79OrYCs,"The asians seemed to be a lot of are in the fire nation.  Their eyes give indication.

The earth benders and water benders seem like indians.

Air benders caucasion."
-egQ79OrYCs,who gives a fuck...you will still watch the movie regardless of the race....everybody always trying to pull the racist card..
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ang isn't an Asian.  He looks white as hell to me.  Big eyed American speaker.   To let you know Americans made this series.   SO it's not Anime.  It's a cartoon ;P.

 I would have prefered a Indian type chick to play katara. much older atleast by a couple  years.   and ang a little older."
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie looks gay as fuck just a cheep rip of the tv show to try and get some quick money avatar shits on this
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow racist bsshes its a white boy playing a asian boy btw so sdfu.
-egQ79OrYCs,@CuBiC82 No they're just homophobes.
-egQ79OrYCs,"damn, dude, that's racist, come on. if u feel that way you're a bitch"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think the casting is good. It's more international. And I mean, show wise. Asians should be Earthbenders, since Asia/Earthkindom is the largest nation/continent. Waterbenders shoud be up north and south like the show. Which leaves room for Europeans, Canadians, South Americans and others. Fire Nation is middle-east Asia, because that is a somewhat  hostile territory, strong with their beliefs in real life. And they are both small compared to others. Air... idk. Whoever likes wind. lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"when the make the 2nd movie, that is based off the 2nd season i hope the hippie singers r in there that lead the team to the cave of two lovers. those hippies crack me up"
-egQ79OrYCs,anybody else notice 666 in his forehead ?
-egQ79OrYCs,This is going to be epic and will do justice to the series.
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope it doesn't end like other anime witch transitioned to movies. And as for the actors not looking exactly like the ones in the cartoon who gives a shit as long as they do the anime/cartoon justice i'm good
-egQ79OrYCs,"I feel like Aang isn't going to be playful like he is in the show. Gah, this is making me sick.

I'm still watching it though 'cause I love Avatar anyways :3"
-egQ79OrYCs,@MrGarySexy Yes they should!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"zuko is a cartoon character, freak."
-egQ79OrYCs,"your an idiot, get a life"
-egQ79OrYCs,"As soon as I heard they were going to make a movie I knew it would be another flash in the pan CGI orgy, if anyone that followed the cartoon show will probably not like this movie cause the characters are all different"
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks really bad. sorry
-egQ79OrYCs,this is like the show but in movie version thats gay
-egQ79OrYCs,@kutedemon17  thats not katara thats sakas girlfriend from the north pole i forget her name but yeah
-egQ79OrYCs,what is the song in this?
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:05
That doesn't look like Zuko
That doesn't look like Iroh

Sorry, this is why Live Action movies developed from animated shows shouldn't exist."
-egQ79OrYCs,where have you ever seen katara with dirty blonde hair??
-egQ79OrYCs,"There's another trailer with Appa, but he's way off in the distance and you have to stop it at the right second. Appa is definately in the movie, but I don't know about Momo. I agree with you, though, this looks WAY to serious (and Zuko's scar looks like a black eye). XP"
-egQ79OrYCs,Wtf why are they all white?
-egQ79OrYCs,"True there, I rather enjoy Micheal Bay movies myself. 
Shyamalan is not the usual guy and I'm not very sure of what to expect from him, but at the least the story will be coherent especially considering he has something to reference instead of coming up with his own.

Not in the movie making business you say! Ding Dong the witch is dead!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko doesn't look anything like himself. Where's Appa and Momo? This seems to be too serious to be a Avatar movie. Avatar is humorous at many points.
-egQ79OrYCs,Tell that to all the people who said Transformers2  was the best movie they have ever seen.
-egQ79OrYCs,IDC what everyone else says I'm soooo excited for July now ^^
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie is gonna suck. Dont they realise that people have stopped going to the movies just for awesome specal effects?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Unlike the dragon ball movie, this actually looks like it will be a somewhat decent film. That will hopefully get the general story of the series to the big screen. Remember this is Shyamalan we are talking, not Uwe Bole or Micheal Bay."
-egQ79OrYCs,it is just the first book
-egQ79OrYCs,lol they look nothing like the people from the show but uh how is the whole series avatar the last airbender to be made into 1 movie lol will it have all the fights from the show or something idk
-egQ79OrYCs,Well dosnt look half bad. Least its being done by the people who wrote it right?....it wont be a DBE atleast....
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kianu725 

Bad movie is bad.

And I hope they dont screw up another anime."
-egQ79OrYCs,going to be a great film. Looks like they're being very close to the show!
-egQ79OrYCs,WOW can't wait for the movie too come out
-egQ79OrYCs,but theyre white on the show lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"I have faith. I think it will be an awesome movie. It might not have every detail that the show has, but I'm sure it will be great. As for the actors, It's hard to find a well trained actors who are so young. Remember people, Their characters are children, not 21 year old's who are meant to play 12 and 14 year old children. I'm excited for katara, and she looks excellent!

WATERBENDERS FOR THE WIN!|"
-egQ79OrYCs,Everything looks awsome exept aang lol he looks a little cheesy lol was that some ballerina move he pulled?
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hate how they have all white people for the cast, it's an Asian based movie! Haha, and when his eyes light up, it reminds me of those robot kids from Spy Kids."
-egQ79OrYCs,Making the Arrow tattoo out of symbols instead of just one big line was a good move on their part. The thing looks beastly.
-egQ79OrYCs,"It seems they succsessfully screwd up the story with the cast. However the spectacle looks very good.

The watretribe should be played by native americans or dark skin mongoloids. The fire nations by north europeans, and earth by chinese.

And yeah, where is the fun? And where the hell is Appa and Momo?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"AHHHHHH!!!!

Goosebumps!!!!!

I gotta see this movie!

And c'mon people, from what I can see the story line seems to be intact, and the action is certainly present. And who cares if the actors are ""ugly"". This isn't 'High School Musical'. 

THIS IS AVATAR.

iChoctate approves."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I forgot about that, haha"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@VampireSamantha
no they looked more like eskimo's and i think they are asian too? 
it just doesn't look right, white people as eskimos... it's like using white people for african tribes..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"ok...
this might look pretty good

Love the effects"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wow they couldve at least try to give them a tan or something,"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i don't like this... i liked the animated series, but this doesn't look very promissing... :/"
-egQ79OrYCs,"well, knowing how movies work, they might just end up removing Appa and Momo from the story :( CGI animals just look like the don't fit very well..."
-egQ79OrYCs,In the original LOTR series there was no mention of what skin color the characters had I think. So its okay that the cast is white.
-egQ79OrYCs,he is lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"I was a fan of the show, and I want this movie to be good, but........."
-egQ79OrYCs,"This looks amazing but they suld have done the character rights. Where the hell is Zuko pony tail. Uncle's white hair, and Aang's playfulness!!?? I did see Sokka kissing that one girl so they got that right. Although I love Jackson they could've cast someone better and Katara too. Since they're like Eskimo people they should'e gotten people who favor the Eskimo ethnicity but it's ok, I'm still going to go see it!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wow this should of been like the Lord of the Rings was with all Whites? this should of been made with mostly Asian Americans & Inuits? i get why whites are in this film because hollywood is racist & they always make Asian characters into white people in there film adaptions & always white wash them... which sucks! but NOW Asians turned into INDIANS!? WTF! M.Night is Indian so im guessing its obvious why theirs Indians in this film! how racist, y couldn't we have Steven Spielberg direct this!"
-egQ79OrYCs,i am a fan of the show and i for one think this will folo the storyline of the show well... i really do not care about the races.
-egQ79OrYCs,"ya i see what your sayin, we shouldnt focus on their race, they should however, be more look-wise correct, maybe some spray tan for the water tribe, but fix Zukos scar XD. But yeah, theyre not supposed to be asian, least not all of em"
-egQ79OrYCs,"All i will say in regaurds to commenting the casting, They couldve done much better with Zuko, much much better*hes got a pony tail and a scar, how the fuck did they mess that up with the ceaser doo?* otherwise, it looks very good =D"
-egQ79OrYCs,Are there going to die people in this movie? (not like in the series..)
-egQ79OrYCs,"You people who are hating on this movie are definately not open to change. This brilliant director turned a kiddie show into what looks to be an action packed movie, which is made for a wider audience, so more people will enjoy it.  Also, about the cast; NO. they shouldn't be asian. This is based off of an American show.  The cartoon characters had Wide, round eyes. Not narrow, slanted eyes.  And the actual people aren't going to look exactly like the cartoon characters. So get over it!"
-egQ79OrYCs,well the cartoon characters really didnt look like asian either
-egQ79OrYCs,would like to see the movie for the Large Navy Scene
-egQ79OrYCs,WTH!!!??? they should use ASIANS instead of white people it just doesn't look right
-egQ79OrYCs,"OK after all the speculations. The movie will rock. I presume that it will include the first two episodes and the last because those in those in between weren't moving the plot.

After all the cast is excellent except Zuko. Jesse McCartney would've been perfect."
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko so doesnt resemble the real one
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf  aang looks like he is two this cast sucks
-egQ79OrYCs,@HOMEgrownALIENS haha Robot Chicken style!
-egQ79OrYCs,i know we asians are insulted!!...i like sokka and katara though..
-egQ79OrYCs,dude the cast pisses me off
-egQ79OrYCs,"i dont like the cast for this, i dont understand why in originally asian films there's not a single fucking asian in one of them! JUST LIKE THE MESSED UP DRAGONBALL MOVIE."
-egQ79OrYCs,what a twist
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Mytruenameis Haha, we'll see how well the first movie does first. From first look the water tribe clothes is already not blue :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I thought Katara would be more better looking and WTF is with the so-called water tribe clothes, aren't they suppose to be blue?I also wonder, how Appa and Momo will turn out. And i also hope to see Azula, Ty Lee, Mei, Order Of White Lotus, Hacoda, and other people :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope they make the sequals cuz this is the worst out the three seasons except the finale
-egQ79OrYCs,1:23 Princess Yue
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wasn't the twist in Sixth Sense the one where Bruce Willis was dead? But, yeah, an angry fanboy/girl is a dangerous thing. Hordes of them are far worse."
-egQ79OrYCs,Fire vs Earth bender is fucken awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,lol avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah i see what you mean
-egQ79OrYCs,"damn.... I wonder how long will it take until main hero of hollywood movies will be 5-6 years old all-mighty ""one-of-a-kind"".... what a bullsh** :("
-egQ79OrYCs,Holy Hell I must see this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,SWEET! it's a must-see!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,legend of zelda!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,I AGREE!
-egQ79OrYCs,Na I Agree And Im Hella White
-egQ79OrYCs,not trying to raise a race war but it would look more official if the antagonists or protagonists were asians. at least one..
-egQ79OrYCs,fail. x100
-egQ79OrYCs,My fail senses are tingling..
-egQ79OrYCs,Why not jsut name the movie the legend of Aang?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ProjectILT 
I'm a Chinese."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ProjectILT 
You mock my own people ? You dare mock ?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this is going to be nothing like the cartoon. y are they making a movie about the same thing the cartoon was about? are they actually going to make a good ending this time? are we going to find out who zuzu's mom is? which btw, the character looks nothing like him, and aangs tatoos are completely different. this sux, its so gunna blow--but im gunna c it anyway..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"-After this movie hits the screen and becomes very popular-

White people who knows nothing besides their own country: ""Wow cool! Those indian people have some interesting history and culture, its so awesome that they had all these different styles of martial arts! and their ancient architectures were so artistic!!!11!!""

Chinese people: FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK"
-egQ79OrYCs,cant believe people would confuse avatar with this lol
-egQ79OrYCs,heeeeeeeelllll yeeeeeeeahhhh
-egQ79OrYCs,SICK!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well tbh nobody gives a fuck, I wanna see it but you think anyone cares?? Stop critiscising you sad little boy!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"""What a twist!"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"the effects looks very good, but...wow really? a white kid playing the asian Avatar? Woow and hes a freaking little kid. i thought he was like a teenager of like 14 or 15. weird how theres NO ASIANS at all in this movie -_-"
-egQ79OrYCs,"This movie should have been made either by Peter Jackson or James Cameron. The effects on water bending in the trailer looks  pretty lame.

Hope it does not disappoint like Dragon Ball."
-egQ79OrYCs,Hey I didnt know Jackson Rathbone plays in this....the guy that plays Jasper in the twilight films...pretty good actor..
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'd like to see you fucking morons make a movie when you don't know shit and just like to base everything off a single theatrical trailer. So what if his last 3 movies sucked, M.NIGHT is a fan of a show so be glad he's doing instead of some random director the studios want."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Indeed they are, they will have the same voices from the cartoons used by same guy."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Actually after the sixth sense there was unbreakable and signs which were both great. But after there was the village, lady in the water, and the happening which those sucked. So yea your almost rigt."
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks very cheap..
-egQ79OrYCs,they should have gotten indians to play katara and sokka.
-egQ79OrYCs,yes. they put zukos scar on the wrong side too
-egQ79OrYCs,Maybe there's going to be 3 moives like the books and this is book water
-egQ79OrYCs,if he screws it up then the creators could make a cartoon version of this exact movie just like it. but funnier.either that sue them!
-egQ79OrYCs,the girl that plays katara in the movie played in somethin else.what movie or tv show did she play in? anyon please anwser
-egQ79OrYCs,"i agree this one looks so... fake =S
just like the rest of the characters, except for Aang o.O"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hope M.Night Shyamalan doesn't screw this up like everything else after 
the 6th sense"
-egQ79OrYCs,i asked the same question
-egQ79OrYCs,"OH MY GOD, SOOOO AWESOME! 

And the actress playing Katara is trying too hard."
-egQ79OrYCs,ew ew ew katara looks like crap why the hell they change her i loved her tan skin
-egQ79OrYCs,"@AllYouHearIsSwoosh well considering the the avatar world it would make sense for airbenders to be asian, waterbenders white, fire maybe arabs or southerners in general, and earth mixed or black. This way you could come up with some great cultural background based on the environment and climate, particular bending and racial looks."
-egQ79OrYCs,i thought his arrow was light blue
-egQ79OrYCs,"@
nick2alaska  i was just think that"
-egQ79OrYCs,Definitely.
-egQ79OrYCs,why do white people have to replace all the other races......Ang is freaking asian!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,ÐÐ° ÑÑÐ¾ Ð¶ ÑÐ¸Ð¿Ð° ÐÐ²Ð°ÑÐ°Ñ - Ð¼ÑÐ»ÑÑÑÐµÑÐ¸Ð°Ð».
-egQ79OrYCs,"eh, it looks like its worth it..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"ok. i understand making books into movies, even making old movies better, but making a cartoon into a live action movie? it just doesn't work."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The film wont follow 100% of the storyline of the cartoon series because each book is under 3 hours whilst each book / season is like 6 hours in total, so they've decided to put the important bits in, there gonna be complaints but EVERYBODY type in Jeff Palmer on youtube and find the video of him talking about it he explains everything 100% which should help you understand the film is gonna be slighlty different to the animated series"
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks quite good, they should've kept zuko bald with a tail but it looks like they kept a lot of the cartoon in there."
-egQ79OrYCs,well they're not gonna be exact.. what more can you ask for?
-egQ79OrYCs,"For all those out there who's complaining about the race, the movie has been declared as being based on the cartoon series, BASED that doesnt mean they will stick 100% to it, they have no obligation with hiring people with the exact skin tone or voice of the cartoon series, both creators of Avatar the last airbender are working with M.Night and they dont have a problem with the cast of the character and its there own show, no film adaptation of a animation is 100% accurate."
-egQ79OrYCs,thank you fro agreing with me
-egQ79OrYCs,Like Dragonball
-egQ79OrYCs,Didn't really like the cast...but i'll admit it does look like it will be good. Should've been kept as a cartoon though
-egQ79OrYCs,american anime??? r u retarded. do u even know what the term anime means? it's the japanese way of saying animation. like mon is short for monster. this isnt american anime cuz there is no such loical thing in the term of which u r thinking. it's a american animation cartoon. just like japanese anime is japanese animation. avatar was a american show with japanese influence.  i hope ur not one of those white american people who is obsessed with japan only cuz of their cartoons and not culture
-egQ79OrYCs,thank god for u animerok007 for setting all these people straight about what anime is and what american animation is. cuz this show was not anime. just like teen titans it was a american show.
-egQ79OrYCs,hope its not like dragon ball z the movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"That's what MuhNight wants you to think. It's going to start out good then it's going and the trademark twist will be that it sucks at the end. That's Muh's style for you. He can't write movies without twists and he can't finish a 7-10 split, just ask Dr. Jan I. Tor."
-egQ79OrYCs,oh my buddah!
-egQ79OrYCs,ÐÐ¿ÑÐ¿ÐµÑÑ.
-egQ79OrYCs,what's song?
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang actor sucks. it is not enough to be bold.
zuko sucks too
(yes, i spelled the names wrong. so what?!)"
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant wait this is giong be pg or pg 13?
-egQ79OrYCs,"If M. Night screwed this up, I'ma be pissed. The show was excellent, and weren't Kitara and Saka tan, and where are cool blue water village cloths."
-egQ79OrYCs,"It definitely could, considering that the cartoon was one of the only decent tv shows I've ever watched. It's kind of pathetic how most don't even focus on an actual plot"
-egQ79OrYCs,Cant wait till it comes out!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Orgato 
Agreed, only issue i had was the wording AVATAR for the avatar 3d movie the font was the same / similair type as the air bender avatar so it seemed kinda odd"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DenverDee303...it's based on ""Avatar: the last airbender"" the cartoon.. not Avatar the movie..so.. u think u know it all?"
-egQ79OrYCs,cool.. they used scenes from the show.. it's along the shows storyline..they kept aang a kid.. the kid actually has some good moves.. this better be good.
-egQ79OrYCs,i couldn't agree more
-egQ79OrYCs,"If this movie fails, im gonna get really mad."
-egQ79OrYCs,No it's not.
-egQ79OrYCs,Does anyone know where i can get a close up pic of aang's tattoo on his head and back?
-egQ79OrYCs,"I believe the cartoon on which this movie is based, is called 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'. and is several years older than the feature film 'Avatar'. But they had to change the title of this to avoid confusion and possibly legal issues."
-egQ79OrYCs,this gave me goosebumps for the entire day
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks like someone started digging in anime back-yard...

my bets are next one is pilot mecha. 


oh yeah, and if this happens to be ANOTHER hollywood shallow action crap, they better put a lock-down on using anime for base from now. God knows what they'd do to Nausicaa!"
-egQ79OrYCs,gay
-egQ79OrYCs,@Orgato actually 10yrs
-egQ79OrYCs,"But she's still in the first book.

Remember, she's in the flashback of the episode ""The Storm."""
-egQ79OrYCs,looks cool so far but i guess ill judge when i see it what im looking for is a good story line that hooks me into the story and i know that the story wont be to similar to the cartoon but i just want a good story and also the acting should be decsent and of course the special effects which is the big thing in this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"name of the song?
and its not ""in a heart beat"""
-egQ79OrYCs,Where's Azula?!?
-egQ79OrYCs,Looking forward :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@Randon1928 fans of the original series are not haters
-egQ79OrYCs,I agree 100%
-egQ79OrYCs,"When I heard that Avatar was being made into a movie, I was terrified. When I heard that M Night Shamalongadingdong was directing, I was filled with a sense of doom. Then I saw the cast, and I was enraged.
However, after seeing this trailer, I feel a bit foolish, because this actually looks good, and faithful to the source material as well. Even the girl who plays Katara sounds like the original voice actress, so I have high hopes."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Look's awesome!

I WAS a little skeptical at first, but this actually doesn't look half bad.  Hope it's as good as the show!"
-egQ79OrYCs,i'm sure this movie is nice. xd
-egQ79OrYCs,i feel like a kid waiting for christmas!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,man they need to the actors they dont look right.
-egQ79OrYCs,i think this movie is gonna look like RA3 rather than CoH. (non realistic) the bending effects make me feel awkward O.o
-egQ79OrYCs,"avatar is actually using asian based martial arts, but it represents a conquest around the world, so they made a diversity in the races in the film"
-egQ79OrYCs,@SaiE8   I know but if they had  used them  they would have produce faster results cause the cast would have know each other already
-egQ79OrYCs,superb! film Iam waiting so!
-egQ79OrYCs,must be dumb like dbz evolution
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, Superman and Batman are real people and you're not going to replace them.  Now, if more cartoons or movies were made about those characters, I wouldn't really give a shit what color the actors were."
-egQ79OrYCs,I wait this movie 2 years!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,just because its drawn in an asian style does not mean they are all asian.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@creapsmantic 
Too much effort for them to go through, the girl playing katara has a katara like voice, and Iroh sounds like the wise old man so its ok, the rest of cast not so sure but will see, but you cant seriously expect a movie BASED on the animated series to use voice actors."
-egQ79OrYCs,EPIC fail they should of used the VOICE actors of the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks okay but also looks like they could seariously skrew it up bad realy easy their on thin ice but i reeaaaly hope its good, in my opinion though they casted aang too young hes 12 not eight"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Katara and Sokka aren`t black, nor are they asian. You`d think that it was obvious from the fact that they live at the poles, in buildings made of ice, but not everyone seems to get that they`re Inuit, or at least based off of the Inuit."
-egQ79OrYCs,"No I get it. :) American's seem to go crazy about race in movies. It really shouldn't matter. But no one is truly 'color blind' it just that people want to see movies clone the show, and has that EVER happened? No. Not in LotR or Star Wars or any other blockbuster. There is always that 'creative license' and just maybe they picked the cast for their acting ability rather then 'we need a white guy..here's one."""
-egQ79OrYCs,love the cartton hope the movie is just as good
-egQ79OrYCs,@AngelTheHuskie are they i there not in the cartoon???
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm hesitant to see this because of Dragonball, but I'll check it out all the same."
-egQ79OrYCs,no mamess!!!!  YEAH!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"so are they only doing the first book? 
does this mean they will be doing two more movies :D i hope so! 
zuko isn't that cute now :( 
i hope this movie can be somewhat as good as the show. i cannot wait till summer to see this! :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,@Kimchilici0us He is - Jackson Rathbone or something like that :) I hope he can pull off being funny like in the series
-egQ79OrYCs,"Zuko had the whitest skin in the series and yet here he wasn't cast as a white guy, nor was anyone else from the fire nation. Interesting all the good guys are white."
-egQ79OrYCs,You're absolutely right. I find it outrageous that not only did they make all the good guys white but that they made the fire nation of color. It's quite ironic that in the series the fire nation had a skin color clearer than any other nation (look at Zuko and compare) and yet in this film they're the only  ones of color. The whites to the rescue it is I guess. I'm very disappointed.
-egQ79OrYCs,@lilaznbboy5z Sokka kisses Yue I think :) looks nothing like her...
-egQ79OrYCs,shut up already Aang and the majority of the characters in the avatar cartoon were mainlyï»¿ asians and inuits there were no whites what so ever! the Creators said that this was an Asian cartoon themselves! in a interview how idiotic can you be are you saying the people who created the cartoon are lying when they said its a Asian Cartoon? look it up! and you do your research and stop believing that Aang or any other character is white because this film makes them out to be! because there NOT!
-egQ79OrYCs,"They should have made kitara older and of indian decent or something.

how can you do that?  Seroiusly ruined.   Those whole event of mystery is RoooINNED'!.    Naw the movie looks kick ass.     LOOKS INcredibly beautiful.    the fire.  the big ball protecting him with APPA!!! only reason it was huge was because of appa.  please tell me momo and appa are in here."
-egQ79OrYCs,will surely be one great hit
-egQ79OrYCs,"i get what your saying
im just making a point i mean just stick to the cartoon don't change anything thats why movies like Dragonball Z were horrible they changed it, instead of keepin it the same as the anime"
-egQ79OrYCs,movie looks good from what i say the only thing they changed was aang's arrows but still cool and did anyone else notice the fire nation main characters all look musilum
-egQ79OrYCs,"Nope. And they don't usually look asian. Unless they are bad guys, the good guys in anime always had big round eyes. Notice that? narrow eyes usually, but not always, meant bad guy.

And lots of anime have blue, green orange, purple hair. But hollywood likes to ruin things, maybe a Japanese movie version like they did with Death Note."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really hope not. The series had a lot going on and a huge ongoing plot. Hopefully they don't try to introduce all the others (like Toph, Zula, Mai, Sokka's girl, ect) all in one movie. They need to focus on just a few characters to make them stronger, or else you end up like the xmen movies. Tons of cast and only 1 character (wolvie) ever being more then just a extra.  I don't see how the movie can go from ""We found Aang!"" to ""Sozin's comet"" in 2 hours...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"LOL! I would love to see a Hollywood version of Naruto! It would be Hilarious. Also, anime characters often look more white than asian anyways. Naruto for example. . .blond hair blue eyes. Sound Asian to you?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"cant wait to see this movie,, ..cant wait for summer to come"
-egQ79OrYCs,I agree. Im not being racist but you wouldnt even see 1 asian in a Lord of the Rings movie so why would you cast an entire movie which should be set in an asian influenced world with everything except asians. I think the inteligent decision would be to make the Fire nation look like Hun Chinese ppl and the Water Tribe look like Tibetans or something(not to be racist) because the show seems 2 parallel issues involving these groups and they do look distinctly different. This doesnt look epic at al
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yea.. the dragonball movie was a massive big buzz-kill.. If they weren't going to do a magnificent job of it (they really could've done better... a few more special effects wouldn't have hurt), they shouldn't of taken it on in the first place."
-egQ79OrYCs,Regardless of all that hooblah shit about anime/cartoon USA/Asia... It will be a good movie. So let's stfu and wait a few months THEN bitch about it. I'm just disappointed I didn't see Aang using a lot of the other 3 elements in the previews...
-egQ79OrYCs,"fucken epic

but they casted ugly characters like saka and katara"
-egQ79OrYCs,"man. summer is so far T_T

are they gonna put the WHOLE series into one movie? or is it gonna be divided?..."
-egQ79OrYCs,this is gonna be sick
-egQ79OrYCs,I agree with what ThEKinGGzA1 is saying but please do not suck up to him.  He's an immature little brat.  He swears and throws a fit at anyone he disagress with.  He doesn't seem to get what the word opinion means.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Also, I have watched pleanty of anime.  I have probebly watched more then you have.  Ive been watching anime sinse I was 12 and I am currently 21.  Maybe you should make better first impressions.  You clearly need it."
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah finally someone with sense i hate when people think asian chracters in cartoon or animes are white because they have big round eyes 1st of all not all asians have slanted eyes and second of all there know as anime drawing there perposly drawn with big round eyes not to look white but that the style of animes anyone who is a fan of animes such as i am would know that! Anime characters are mostly drawn with big round eyes! and big pupils also! get your facts straight!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Avatar the last Airbender isn't anime, its a cartoon, it was made in the good old USA"
-egQ79OrYCs,Whats wrong with white people you dickbag?
-egQ79OrYCs,Hes in the tv spot. dont worry. they wont have every single thing packed into every ad.
-egQ79OrYCs,I want a smoothie blender.
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is the first season. Toph doesn't appear until Season Two.

Plus, their names are Katara and Sokka."
-egQ79OrYCs,"If there's ever a commentary on the dvd, this'll all be answered. Besides, performance is what really matters.

Also, she's kinda cute, in a way."
-egQ79OrYCs,i  hope its a Bad ass movie and hope they dont kill it
-egQ79OrYCs,Avatar: The Last Airbender isn't Anime
-egQ79OrYCs,"He has it, it's a little hard to see, but it's there."
-egQ79OrYCs,I wouldn't say spongebob's for 2 yr olds. The humor's still there after all these years.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@knshuffler
i know right?
Why is Aang a Mexican and Zuko an Indian this movie sucks already!"
-egQ79OrYCs,It was cancelled after the initial story was completed.
-egQ79OrYCs,"where r all the Asians?
Isn't the arrows supposed to be blue?
Why is Zuko an Indian and Aang a Mexican?
Movie sucks already"
-egQ79OrYCs,"probably not, this first movie is gonna be a remake of the first chapter of the cartoon up to the point where they had that battle in the water tribe, so they havent met Toph yet"
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't think Toph is even in this movie!  It sucks already!
-egQ79OrYCs,@fuckemos45 they probably not showing them yet or they didnt put them in there
-egQ79OrYCs,wheres appa and momo appa and momo appa and momo appa and momo appa and momo appa and momoappa and momo appa and momo appa and momoappa and momo appa and momo appa and momo
-egQ79OrYCs,appa is in the movie dude
-egQ79OrYCs,Badass
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh MY FLIPPIN GOSH CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,the girl and boy are tanned not white but oh well it still looks nice its just weird though i wonder where is the earth girl
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang was decent.
-egQ79OrYCs,wheres Aapa?
-egQ79OrYCs,"No, fuck Shyamalan, who decided it was more important to play around with his Indian buddies than it was to get decent actors that looked like the characters."
-egQ79OrYCs,Now it is a light facepaint.
-egQ79OrYCs,The main character?  Aang?
-egQ79OrYCs,@raffsterclub lol and he looks like a toddler... ang wasnt old but come one was he seriously that young?
-egQ79OrYCs,"EWW! The Dude looks UGLY! D: LOL. i forgot the main characters name, but he's UGLY. LOL. Even the Cartoon looks better than thatXD"
-egQ79OrYCs,"it wasnt cancelled they actually finished it. they just didnt show it from time to time cause when one season ended it took like 6 months before the next one would come out.if i remember in order it was book 1: water, book 2: earth and then book 3 i think it was fire. i think i remember a book  but im not completely certain. from the looks of it the movie might just be the first season of the cartoon"
-egQ79OrYCs,Here goes shamalan ready to make an awesome kid show into an adult movie(sort of) his arrow isn't even blue. It's swirly lines
-egQ79OrYCs,"(Oops, I misspelled 'sHort' and 'movieS')"
-egQ79OrYCs,What a twist!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Man I hope this movie is longer than 90 minutes, those movie are WAY TOO SHORT!!!
Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince was good, but so dissapointingly sort.
T_T"
-egQ79OrYCs,Mr.Whatatwist better deliever with this film or I will be so angry.
-egQ79OrYCs,ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i cant wait 2 see dis shit im a fucking big ass fan 4real
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't like to see action movies where i feel like i could every characters ass.
-egQ79OrYCs,like god i keep hearing arguments that because this is a western film that this characters are white? are you that stupid to belive that! all Americans cartoons have only white characters in them? what idiots! this was mainly Asians & Inuits in it not whites or indians despite what you dumbnuts believe! stop thinking Asians are Whites dammit! cause were not! Bulma was White Goku wasnt! Aang is not white either & the other Animes made into film adaptions with whites leads are bulshit asian fakers
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ProjectILT 

lols i knew this was gonna start a race war."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Hey can you guys STFU! and stop thinking Asains are you White people I NO YOU THINK WERE COOL! but STOP THINKING YOUR ASIAN! we dont think were WHITE! i dont think Superman is Asian or Batman or the Hulk Etc! who all have names Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, Bruce Bannor us Asian stupid enogh to think there Asians like you white are stupid enough to think Aang & Goku is white get over yourselves you retards! do you also think Jackie Chan & Bruce Lee is white to? morons!"
-egQ79OrYCs,i really loved the series but i dont think a 3 hour movie is gonna be able to tell the entire main story
-egQ79OrYCs,"1.This cast should be all Mainly Asian & Inuits like the Lord of The RIngs were all whites! & why do you think ppl are upset because once again hollywood is changing asian characters to damn whites! like Speed Racer, DBE & a long list of others!
2. M.Night only had 1 good movie sixth sense
3. No 1 said the film sucked yet we only said the cast sucks & i read reviews on the screening 1 said that this film was average & the other said this film had bad acting & was corny no 1 said it was awesome!"
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG this looks SO SICK!!! Everyone who hates it .. AT LEAST HE STUDIED THE SERIES SO HE KNOWS THE STORY!!! like in some parts I can see season's 1 finale so ALL THOSE HATERS STFU!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"well whats wrong with ppl asking those questions? When the cartoon first came out it also had the words Last Airbender in it, and sure everyone would go and ask ""Why is he the last?"", and then go watch it to find out. Its these questions that makes ppl watch it lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"the moment i found out about the casting i was alrdy pissed off at this movie lol. Knowing that M Night was mid eastern, and then looking at the cast list....seeing  75% of the actors to be also mid eastern.....I mean WTF
 
Throw some fucking asians in there ffs, its a cartoon based on ancient chinese and japanese culture, stop ripping their glory and pretend all those awesomeness comes from indians/middle eastern/ w.e"
-egQ79OrYCs,my uncle worked on this movie so i got to go behind the scenes but i can't show you anything
-egQ79OrYCs,wwhhyyyy does Ang have to look like a four year old!
-egQ79OrYCs,fuck holly wood
-egQ79OrYCs,"The movie is different from the cartoon series because every director likes to do his own thing. M. Night wants this to be known as his movie, not some copy of someone else's work.  Besides, it would be boring if it was the cartoon all over again.  The cartoon is the cartoon and the movie is the movie, two interpretations of the same plot."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Agreed, LOLthatsme900.  The show was never about the appearances of the character, it was about their personalities and how they grew together."
-egQ79OrYCs,Um... Avatar is an American cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddyH335 Thanks! i'll look it up
-egQ79OrYCs,"I dunno, the more I see of the movie, the more I'm looking forward to it.  And as of now, Mike and Brian have no plans for a season 4 of the show.   I pray that changes someday."
-egQ79OrYCs,I ndians are asians! but they're elements are wroong.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Toph isn't gonna come into it until the second movie.  I know what you mean, though.  I wanna see Toph too."
-egQ79OrYCs,"we-ll at least they put asians. Indians! haha.Just being the humoured me. I'm not siding the fire nation. THAT cast, I agree. they shouldn't put the guy from Slumdog millionaire there, nor indians on that part as fire. Indians shoud be in water element"
-egQ79OrYCs,umm.... I know the dragonball 2009 movie was so gay. I think the last airbendeer will be great. Hope it doesnt fail.
-egQ79OrYCs,"all of you who are whining about they being too white... but the show was in OTHER WORLD, NOT IN EARTH, SO THEY CAN BE WHATEVER THEY WANT!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I TOTALLY AGREE!!!
how is there NO ASIANS
zuko is not a brown name.. 
n why is uncle iroh a skinny iranian guy..
iuno sokka and aang dont seem that bad
i wonder how appa is gonna look like???"
-egQ79OrYCs,they could have done better picking actors that actually look like Sokka and KItara hmmm white kids playing inuits hmm oh well still looks like it will be amazing I'll see it the opening night. Hope M night doesn't drop the ball
-egQ79OrYCs,"first toph was not around till book 2, and second there will be no further seasons. they finished up the whole story last year"
-egQ79OrYCs,wow that really sounds like Sakka... wait...where the hell is TOPH!
-egQ79OrYCs,man how does m nights movies get worse and worse ...and worse...and worse with each one he makes
-egQ79OrYCs,I belive you mean Too Caucasian. But i Agree . Would look alot better with Asians in it.
-egQ79OrYCs,"damn...
1:35

cool"
-egQ79OrYCs,not another american remake of asian hit cartoons....tsk2x....SO SO SO LAME!!! I HAVENT SEEN DRAGONBALL THE MOVIE AND BY LOOKING AT IT'S TRAILER ....IT REALLY SUCKS....TSK2X ...AMERICANS ARE SUCH A LAME-OS....SHOULD HAVE STICK TO THEIR VAMPIRES AND DRAGONS AND SUPERHEROES IN REMAKING....
-egQ79OrYCs,"Katara sounds like the animation voice, but doesnt really look like she fits the character. And Sokka's kind of old. Aang is okay, but... ahh. none of the people look like the tv animation, but i guess that might be sort of the point. I dont think ill be satisfied with the movie though. Love the tv series though!"
-egQ79OrYCs,THESE ARE TRUE FACTS.
-egQ79OrYCs,"god i hope they don't screw up film industry sure knows how to screw adaptations

wondering if it will took all the series or just the first book for now

anyways for defenders, its a fucking trailer its ment to hype the shit out of people dont get your hopes high until you've seen the movie better enter without knowing anything about it (the movie not the series)

for haters its just a trailer what do you expect why are you nitpicking something that barely makes 2 minutes?"
-egQ79OrYCs,he fits sokka so well
-egQ79OrYCs,"I agree too. In the LotR world there weren't any asiatic cultures. In these...its ALL asiatic. If you watch the extras on the DVDs, they even say the bending styles were based on different forms. Kungfu was Earth, Taichi was water...ect. They should have gone with the societies predominately have those styles as the cast. 

I am still going see the movie. But its Shyamalan....does that mean there is going to be some crazy twist at the end like all his others?"
-egQ79OrYCs,what the hell is this shit?
-egQ79OrYCs,"This series actually had an ongoing plot  meaning that there would eventually be an end. From the very beginning, it was evident that it would only have 3 seasons.

Also each episode of Spongebob is standalone meaning whatever they think of they can put in an episode.

And Spongebob is nowhere near the longest running cartoon. The Simpsons firmly has that spot with King of the Hill being number 2. So I'm ""pretty dang sure"" you are wrong."
-egQ79OrYCs,@VyTe86 it has the style of an anime but it isnt an anime. the REAL definition of an anime is some animated tv show/movie made in japan. simple as that
-egQ79OrYCs,"honestly i wouldn't be so worried about it if it looked like Aang had even knew how to smile in these previews, even when he was escaping the steamer in the cartoon his actions were full of humor and mischief, I just wasn't getting that same feeling from him in the trailers I've seen.
hopefully you're right and I'm just overreacting though."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Why would they pick up at the very end of the series? People who haven't seen the show would so lost lost as to what is happening. 

The movie will end how the first season ended."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Technically, it's not an anime...."
-egQ79OrYCs,@VyTe86 it isnt an anime if its american lol. just has an anime style
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:26

nice!"
-egQ79OrYCs,all i know is if this guy fucks this movie up. All hell will break lose.
-egQ79OrYCs,I can't help but laugh watching this trailer.
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks awesome. I've seen all of the animation so i can't wait to watch the movie. I think it will definitely do the series justice.
-egQ79OrYCs,after this they really need to continue the cartoon version i mean they can like make up this other problem or something to start 3 new seasons i mean i really like this show!
-egQ79OrYCs,Wooaahh..Kitara is Smexi :O
-egQ79OrYCs,3 movies to all 3 books. The reason you dont see Toph or other improtant characters as of yet. Follow the cartoon if you want animated story.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@millioboy
i know right man..i think there goin to make a 2nd part to dragon ball
it better be better then the first one man 
cause the first one sucks dick!
they better have asians man...shieeeet"
-egQ79OrYCs,@iVoltTV YOU ARE SO FUCKING RIGHT!
-egQ79OrYCs,"This looks awesome
so shut up Haters"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ok, first of all.  Learn to read.  I never in fact said that Aang was white.  I just said he looks a bit white.  You need to calm the fuck down because it's a fucking movie.  You're bitching over something that has no impact on your life.  grow up and stop trolling this video."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@feuryie 
-.- *disappointed* i thought it would pick up at book ""Fire"". How do they plan on ending the movie? Grrrrrrr"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@iVoltTV  -.- No.
First of all, it wasn't canceled it was meant to be a cliff hanger. Spongebob is for two year olds and has no plot, it doesn't have to end if there is no plot. And technically the Simpson is the longest running cartoon."
-egQ79OrYCs,hmmm... looks like it just goes through season 1. hmm..
-egQ79OrYCs,Because there cant possibly be another film within the next 9 years in which every cast member was a poor choice.
-egQ79OrYCs,"So they're taking a shitty cartoon and turning it into a shitty movie?

Just great."
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah :D thats what im also thinking XD should be like 90% :D  Same thing they did with the dragon ball z movie XD Goku should have been asian..etc!!  Just ruins the mood
-egQ79OrYCs,"this looks like c**p , i mean where is zuko's
burn mark?
and that is just one mark on what i think is wrong with this trailer"
-egQ79OrYCs,Avatar made by James Cameron which is somethig completely else. If you are talking about the series... um... wiki it? lol.
-egQ79OrYCs,"i thought Unbreakable was boring, but  I did love Signs cuz it was the first movie that made me jump cuz it played on my imagination rather than some bad gory film w/ some guy chasing you around."
-egQ79OrYCs,c'mon man no asians?
-egQ79OrYCs,the decade just started a couple months ago. how would u know?
-egQ79OrYCs,"I never realy liked the cartoon when it was on, but this looks really good! It makes me wish I got more into the series when it was on."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wait, didn't they already make an Avatar movie?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Casting fail of the decade
-egQ79OrYCs,"It's not going to be anything like the series, and probably nowhere near as good, but as a fan I'm going to see it anyway."
-egQ79OrYCs,i probably won't like it THAT much cause it won't resemble the cartoon enough but i have to admit his avatar state looks narly :)
-egQ79OrYCs,"Is it  just me or are people complaining over really stupid reasons
 1. The cast should be Asain
No one said that for Speed Racer and that was a good movie, besides I don't think they'll ever have enough
 2. M. Night Shyamalan always makes bad movies.
So the Sixth Sence, Unbreakable and The Village all sucked?
 and 3. This movie already sucks!
How many people said that about a movie before it became one of your favorites?
Personally I hope it will be great because it looks EXCELLENT!"
-egQ79OrYCs,apparently people say its called in a heartbeat from 28 days later.
-egQ79OrYCs,go m. night shamlfdsjiahfdila!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm pretty sure it was created by the composer for the movie for the trailer so i don't know if it has a name.
-egQ79OrYCs,they had to changed the title to the last airbender because of James Cameron's Avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,What's that song they use in the trailer?
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheRandomGamerz they couldn't use the word 'avatar' because of the James Cameron's film ;(
-egQ79OrYCs,holy shit im so waiting 4 this!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,thumb this up if u think its a good movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"Plus, when the live action Dragonball movie was coming out, I decided to, at least ,give it a chance and wait until I actually see it before criticizing despite what everyone was saying in the years beforehand.

Now, the Dragonball movie completely BLEW that chance, but at least I gave it one."
-egQ79OrYCs,"As usual, we have people heavily criticizing a movie before it's even out based on assumptions made from a small amount of trailer footage.

Consider this:

Months before The Dark Knight came out, everyone complained about how ""the gay guy from Brokeback"" was playing the Joker and ""no one can possibly top Jack Nicholson!""

IMMEDIATELY AFTER Dark Knight was shown, everyone started saying, ""They can't ever do the Joker again cause no one can possibly top Heath Ledger!""

I found that funny."
-egQ79OrYCs,has nothing to do with the movie Avatar. This movie is based on the American Animated Series Avatar: The Last Airbender
-egQ79OrYCs,so is this the prequel to avatar?
-egQ79OrYCs,@alexalexdobre welcome. :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@Rafa38 I totally agree.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@rebeccachia Aang's arrow is blue, but a different shade of blue and has detail to the tat."
-egQ79OrYCs,@alexalexdobre watch the cartoon on the nicktoons network. There's your story.
-egQ79OrYCs,OMGGG Dev Patel!!! <333 This is gonna be sooo epic!! :D
-egQ79OrYCs,isnt this exactly like avatar the lgend of ang
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara looks nice :) I can;'t belive i'M saying this! but why isn't Aang's arrow blue?
-egQ79OrYCs,how old is the girl who plays Katara anyway...she is supost to be 14...she looks the same age as Ang...
-egQ79OrYCs,cant wait till july .
-egQ79OrYCs,@PuzzleboxFilms ....This is not Naruto. ._.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Koumori88 

The bad guys are the ones with...

Wait, what? Are you trying to make this into a race thing? I don't even understand why that would be an issue. It's not like they were trying to insinuate that all dark skinned people are evil. Sheesh. Leave it to people like you to try to make something out of everything."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Is it just me, or does Katara sound like...

Katara?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang always looked Chinese to me, and his outfit was reminiscent of that of Chinese monks as well.  He looks perfectly cast.

Also, yeah, it's annoying that Sokka and Katara don't look Inuit - but there's no point in getting insanely picky.  I mean, their names aren't exactly Inuit either."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@coldbloodfireAzula Azula's not really until the next one, though...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The production design looks exactly like that of the anime - for example, the Fire Nation ships - and that excites me. 8D

I admit, I think this movie looks awesome. *_*"
-egQ79OrYCs,"FINALLY a fucking movie that actually KEEPS MOSTLY TRUE to what it's based off of! I'm giving this a 5* already, good job at casting, too, it's gonna be beast.

Having symbols where his markings are, and having them glow....damn that's a nice spin on Aang. 

I bet they had to change the name because of the other Avatar movie. lol (That was a damn good movie, too)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@coldbloodfireAzula well , the director said in his interview that he plans to make 3 movies,one for each book , and azula only apears in the end of the first (the last chapter). so I think its gonna be just like that . Azula would apear in the end of this one and participate in the seconde..."
-egQ79OrYCs,hey i dont see Zukos scar
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheWhiteStripes3 they're not white either. They kinda screwed up the casting in my opinion
-egQ79OrYCs,There were tons of moments in the series where he was serious.  So I don't know what the problem is.
-egQ79OrYCs,I would like to point out that there are tons of whites with such names.  Do your research before acting like you know everything there is to know about ethnicity.
-egQ79OrYCs,"You have serious issue, it's an opinion.  There is no need to go swearing like a dumb child at everyone you disgree with.  Aang has always looked white to me in the series.  They fucked up on Katar and Saka though...  But that's my opinion.  I'm sure you will swear like a dumb child at me..."
-egQ79OrYCs,We haven't even gotten a clear view of his staff yet.  But it looks pretty wooden to me imo.
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont like his tattoos and his stalf was wooden in the show wasnt it and the avatar state glow looks kinda weird  but im still going to go see it hopefully it dosnt completey suck like dragon ball evolution that was horrible
-egQ79OrYCs,thank the movie gods jessie mcartney isn't going to be in this
-egQ79OrYCs,"the kid playing the last air bender is too chubby cheeked, looks like a squirrel"
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm skeptical because M. Night Shyamalan is directing this movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,"That's the point, in the story the Aang's only 12. If it was someone older and taller that would screw up the whole movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,well said
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie is gonna not be as good for me because aang looks like a baby chimpanzee, they shoulda casted someone a lil bit older and taller, this movie looks kinda lame since the main character looks like a bitch"
-egQ79OrYCs,"On a final note, while Avatar was influenced by Asian culture, having the actors look EXACTLY like they did in the cartoon (or at least how you think they should look) is just nitpicking.  When casting, you must find a balance between acting talent and ""looking the part"", afterwhich you use makeup & costumes to get it as close as possible to the style you're going for.  I think they're going for fantasy, not Asian.

And I prefer to watch a movie before I bash it.

Ok, I'm going to bed now."
-egQ79OrYCs,"hey guys, there's no need to argue here. this great movie will be pirated and sold by communist country anyway and this will make their economy boost even more. well, as the famous line from a movie here says, they're nothing but SECOND GRADE trying hard, copycat. American and British movies and music is still the best for us!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah, but they never CONFIRMED their races. Therefore, people ASSUMED the characters are not white. Some could be and some could not. Who knows?

Though most of the references are from Asia, there's still a little American spice in there.

Anyway, I wasn't talking about who's white and who's not. I was saying don't let the actors ruin the movie for you just because they don't look or sound like the characters from the animated series."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Now that I think about it, Superman isn't American... he's Kryptonian.

But the story did require that in order to maintain his secret identity, he had to pass off as a farm boy from Kansas.  If he had landed in Tokyo instead of Smallville, then he probably would've needed to look Asian.

The ethncity of the actors in Avatar, on the other, don't really affect the plot.  The Avatar world is meant as a fantasy one, which is why we're saying ""influenced"" instead of ""directly based""."
-egQ79OrYCs,the asians need to start making these movies.
-egQ79OrYCs,What happened to Zuko's scar?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@KoolJayJ Superman, on the other hand, is still an alien visiting our own personal reference of Earth.  Other than the supervillains and sci-fi weapons, the story actually directly says that the culture is American.  The city may be fictional but the country is not.  The actual character is the fictional element in this case, not the environment.  If the setting was much more ambiguous, then you'd probably be right.

Besides, Dean Cain played Superman, and he's half-Asian.  No one noticed."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@KoolJayJ Because we are still talking about a fictional fantasy world.  The world of Avatar is an alien culture same as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.

The point I'm trying to make is that the designers used an Asian influence in this fantasy world, but they also used bits of other cultures.  While mostly asian, it's still ambiguous.

And sadly, American-made movies are going to have American actors.  I think the filmmakers just want the four nations to be distinguishable, not the race."
-egQ79OrYCs,"People, the characters from the cartoon (not anime) are STYLIZED humans.

Do even know how hard it is to find an actor that looks like the character AND sound like them too? 

And what with this agrument about who is what race? Just because someone looks like a certain race doesn't ALWAYS mean that they are that particular race.

At least, go see the movie first before you start bashing it.



The series was meant for entertainment, NOT JUDGMENT."
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf! hes white?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah... I fuckin hate when movies fill in the ""supposed to be"" ethnicity with some white asshole."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm actually pretty stoked for this movie. Of course, it's not going to be as great as the series, and things are going to be different. I love Avatar either way."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, I just looked up the guy who plays Zuko.  (Dev Patel)

Apparantly, he is a British actor (so Zuko will probably have a english accent) and his parents are Indian (which explains his skin tone).

He is also a martial artist (even has a black belt), which partly explains how he got the role of Zuko.

In any case, this guy has a mixed heritage, so his potrayal of Zuko will be... interesting.  I haven't seen anything he's in, so I can't really say what kind of actor he is as of yet."
-egQ79OrYCs,Why the Fuck are they white. They are suppose to be chinese! this movie looks really retareded just like the dragon ball movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"And you're an idiot.....seriously you just judged the film based entirely on the physical attributes of the actors in a trailer.  Frankly skin color and 'prettyness' shouldn't mean jack if they turn out to be even half way decent actors, and I already like the choice for zuko and Iroh based on previous films they were in.  Dev Patel and ESPECIALLY Shaun Toub are good actors and were chosen because of that, not because they're pretty or look like non cartoon versions of their characters."
-egQ79OrYCs,I just hope it still has the comedy that kept me watching the series
-egQ79OrYCs,why is katara white? they should of chosen a hotter actress
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG i fuckin cant wait for this!!!
yes there are some differences but still, i wanna see it!! FUCK! xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,"the characters are fine with me but rly? 
why is zuko not asian?
and also his uncle?
oh wells. i'll try to adjust"
-egQ79OrYCs,"rickcoffee, you make really, really good points. I also agree with you about Zuko. Though Personally, I don't mind Dave Patel. I only wish they had made his scar/burn much more prominent."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The thing is, if you take away the ""Asian"" wardrobe, you're left with characters with cartoon faces and American accents.

And they still took influences from other cultures as well.  The original firebenders (the sun people) had a Mayan influence.

Aside from the Asian influence in their design, they're about as Asian as a Jedi Knight.  (which were influenced by samurai)

As long as they can portray the characters, I don't mind.  (But I'll admit, I'm iffy on the guy who plays Zuko.)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"In my opinion, Aang looks a little more violent than in the original. Regardless, I haven't  seen the movie yet and it seems somewhat promising..."
-egQ79OrYCs,I'd really like to hear Aang talk. He hasn't said a word in any of the trailers.
-egQ79OrYCs,The bending looks great. I hope we get a good CGI appa and momo
-egQ79OrYCs,"@necroDELTA

At least he still has one.  I heard from somewhere that he wasn't even gonna have it in the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@angelsdescend Nah, I'd expect there to be some comedy.  Avatar is more of an adventure story than a comedy, so they're just previewing it as one.

I was actually afraid it was going to be too kiddy.  (I never really cared for Nickelodeon movies.)  So I was actually relieved to see this.

I'm sure once more previews come out, we'll start seeing some comedy moments.

I actually like Aang's tattoos in this.  More detailed.

But I agree.  Zuko's scar is far too subtle.  Barely visible."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@PowersCast

M. Night Shyamalan got into Avatar because of his daughter"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Appa, sorry if I spelled his name wrong, but I'm sure he is in the movie as you can see him in a different trailer."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Ayezly 

I don't know if he produced it or not, but I do know that he had some part in it, because I saw a behind the scenes thing on nickelodeon, and it showed him with a title underneath his name. But i can't remember for the life of me what it was."
-egQ79OrYCs,kid that plays air bender (forgot his name) looks like a HORRIBLE actor
-egQ79OrYCs,"@PowersCast 

How do you figure? M. Night Shyamalan's name was no where in the credits"
-egQ79OrYCs,"if I was replying to your comment then I would've clicked on the reply button.

I accept your apology :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, I can pretty much guarantee this movie will be better than the Dragonball Evolution movie.

One of the main problems with that movie (among MANY) was that they obviously ran out of money halfway through.

At least this movie looks like it has a decent budget."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@theULTIMATETetris

 I will have you know, M. Night Shyamalan was the same guy who produced the series, so he will keep it true."
-egQ79OrYCs,please be better than the dbz real action movie
-egQ79OrYCs,forreals they ruined DBZ first and now avatar wat's next??.....THey even ruined kamen rider....Ugh American ppls these days
-egQ79OrYCs,why arnt there asian people
-egQ79OrYCs,This actually looks pretty good.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Shamalamadingdong just ruined a great show. And he didn't even try to use some asian people. 

Movie directors really need to research video games or shows before they make them. COME ON!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,@iluvdrakeandjosh Zuko had a scar but it was small. I'm more angry about the fact that ZUKO SHOULD BE HOT WTF HAPPENED THERE
-egQ79OrYCs,and wheres appa and momo?!
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think i will enjoy this even more because i didnt watch the anime,so wont compare one to another"
-egQ79OrYCs,"As for the complaints about race, these characters are supposed to be from different parts of the world.  They can't all be Asian!

I mean, the Water Tribes live in the North and South Poles, so wouldn't that make them Eskimos or something?

Sure, the show had an Asian influence, but this world doesn't have an Asia, Europe, or America.  It has an Earth Kingdom and a Fire Nation.

If the Fire Nation was on the Western Hemisphere, does that mean fire benders are American?"
-egQ79OrYCs,:P the casting was a fail on thier part. -.- white people where tan should be and tan where white should be. And WHERE THE HELL is zuko's scar?!!? That's like..his thing.
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie is based on book 1, i dopnt expect toph would be there"
-egQ79OrYCs,i think they could have picked a better iroh and zuko
-egQ79OrYCs,"Low hopes, but still feel this is going to be better than the abomination that was Dragon Ball Z: Evolution(...ughh...)"
-egQ79OrYCs,U know they cant put everything from the cartoon into the movie due to dates and times etc...HOwever the fighting and bending is what I wana see BADLY
-egQ79OrYCs,"He has a scar, look carefully (in the scene where he puts on a helmet), its not as big as in the cartoon though"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i have low hopes.....
hopefully this movie will proven myself wrong"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Love the cartoon, but not a big fan on Shyamalan's films. The Sixth Sense and Signs were good, but the rest were kinda FAIL! I have hopes for this though;("
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wow this movies is going to be as BAD as the wannabe Dragon Ball Z!!
Such tragedy!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm not saying this movie makes the show, or itself look bad but...

WHERE THE HECK IS ZUKO'S SCAR?!?!
That's like, a HUGE part of his character and all!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,wiki
-egQ79OrYCs,"Avatar is set in an Asian-influenced world[2] of Chinese martial arts and elemental manipulation. The show drew on elements from East Asian (especially Chinese and Japanese) culture, blending the styles of anime and US domestic cartoons."
-egQ79OrYCs,thie bending doesnt look very good....
-egQ79OrYCs,"AVATAR IS NOT JAPANESE ANIME! It's american animation! Its made by Nickelodeon, thats like calling The Simpsons or Family Guy anime, sure it's animation but it's not what people call ""anime"""
-egQ79OrYCs,This is probably book 1:Water.
-egQ79OrYCs,@eddyH335 i know who cares about the actors as long as the movie is good
-egQ79OrYCs,I dont think this move will surpass the cartoon since its alot harder to make it look good but weÂ´ll see that when its out
-egQ79OrYCs,1:18 earthbending!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,isnt zuko that guy from slumdog millionair wow lolz
-egQ79OrYCs,I am a bit sketchy of this although it looks like they kept the somewhat serious feeling the last 2 seasons of the show had. Id just hate the see another crappy movie based off something that is actually good.
-egQ79OrYCs,"""the Happening"" and ""lady in the water"" were big disappointments but this looks different.I am sure M.night is going to redeem his name with this movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm definitely going to see this, but it seems like it is going to be completely different then the show, which is pretty stupid in my opinion."
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm not a fan of M. Night at all after constant dissapointments! That being said this is not an original story he made out his ass and therefor it should be good he's a good director but a bad screen writer! This trailer looks kick ass the young man playing Ang is perfect in resemblance to his animated counterpart! But I wonder if he will have that same kinda humble voice! Oh yeah this trailer kicks ass!
-egQ79OrYCs,mee to
-egQ79OrYCs,"this is so stupid, all of the characters are supposed to be ASIAN just like in the anime. u know how stupid this movie looks? whoever watches and likes this u are retarted."
-egQ79OrYCs,ok the cartoon is ok but the effects and graphics in this is cool i guess its worth seeing
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks sick
-egQ79OrYCs,"it makes more sense because the cold usually generates in lighter skin. places that are warm (fire nation) the people are darker, like in miami, people are darker..."
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm EXCITED!! Even though they changed the characters' races... Tch.. why cast white ppl as the water tribe? Tch! D<
-egQ79OrYCs,I was hoping this wouldnt turn out like DRAGON BALL Z the movie. and i expected Ang to be asian... and Zuko...
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara ain't hot no more
-egQ79OrYCs,"'Hello? Whine Whine One? I need a WHHAAAAAMBULENCE dispatched to this location immediately!"""
-egQ79OrYCs,agreed
-egQ79OrYCs,"It actually looks pretty good. Great director and epic special effects company. The scenes on the trailer look pretty in pair with the animated series and I personally liked the complexity added to Aang's tatoos. I don't know why, but I jumped when I saw the earthbender. Toph, maybe??? The airbending somehow looks a little lacking. Also, it apparently looks like they comprissed the whole three books into the movie. That ought to be difficult, and honestly, it worries me quite a bit."
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf happened to youtube!? O_o it's like break now..
-egQ79OrYCs,The girl is too young.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Zenith We all knew that DBZ would be horrible though, just one look at the trailer and we could tell, it was by a director who had no idea what he was doing and wasn't even a fan of the show. However Shyamalan is a solid director and a fan of the show and this does not look like the crap that Dragonball Evolution obviously was"
-egQ79OrYCs,"true that. that's why it's better to just make a movie but keep  it animated. it's saves us the trouble of watching an awesome show/anime f***ed up by real ppl. this looks so-so, it'll be cool to see how it turns out"
-egQ79OrYCs,The one at 0:59 was the Siege of the North episode right? With all those ice buildings? And at 1:16 is the first two new episode with the one when Katara and Sokka found him then rescued him? The Boy in the Iceberg part 2?
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope they keep the humor from the show. this makes it look too serious
-egQ79OrYCs,omfg this movie looks so fucking beast!!!!! i wanna see this movie already!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mrlijones89 that's normally the case for these types of movies. Cartoons made into live-action. For Example i didnt see the dbz movie, but I was gonna for laughs. It looked exceptionally horrible"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really expected more charectoers of color, (asian-fire, native american-water, hindu-air, possibly black-earth) know what I mean?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"It is impossible for this movie to be OK, (to real avatar fans) To us, from the teasers, it will either be magnificent or extremely horrible."
-egQ79OrYCs,"well like I said I read it in wiki 
and i know avatar is regular cartoon it is made in the U.S and is a great cartoon =)"
-egQ79OrYCs,LOLOL he's a buffalo.
-egQ79OrYCs,"omgomgomgomG!!! IM SO GLAD THIS IS COMING OUT!!!  the earth bending looks tight as heck!!!!  but the air seems weak  to me, idk

i hope shamalayan doesn't epically fuck this movie up like most of his other ones."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah, but they look better than the Dragonball movies actors.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Duno... I like Uncle Iroh XD

But he more looks like negative character than positive XD"
-egQ79OrYCs,"He might not be the pretiest but if he will play well, I don't care how he looks. Atleast Zuko fangirls will cool down  -_-

Besides I'm sure that if actors will play like shit, you will completly forget that their looks suit."
-egQ79OrYCs,"This looks awful, every actor in there looks terrible"
-egQ79OrYCs,hmmm the avatar state looks pretty cool
-egQ79OrYCs,I wish they had picked a better zuko but other than that it looks pretty good!
-egQ79OrYCs,this is what people get for choosing an Indian director. People are just racist cuz Avatar the Last Airbender is based on a Chinese story with Chinese Gung-fu and they use a completely non-Chinese cast.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I never seen the show but the trailer looks cool and looks close to the source material from what little I know. I was never into DBZ when I was a kid but I can tell the movie last year didn't look nothing like the series that it's based off of.

For the past year, I thought Cameron was going to direct this but it turns out there are two different ""Avatar"" movies."
-egQ79OrYCs,Do you really think that it is that easy to find people who look like characters and can act properly at the same time?
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko is aight man just up and enjoy! u can be thankful they made a movie out of it!
-egQ79OrYCs,hmmm true the characters really don't look like it on the show and zuko should be more handsome but it actually doesn't look that bad
-egQ79OrYCs,air-bender
-egQ79OrYCs,"since the show is a cartoon, it would be hard for someone to find actors to look like the originals."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The movie might not suck like the weaboo kiddie cartoon .. maybeh.

This is probably the best anyone can really hope for..."
-egQ79OrYCs,in the anime they are out boating fishing not walking weird
-egQ79OrYCs,"THis might not suck?!

(i think i just jinxed it)"
-egQ79OrYCs,Gonna have to wait till movie 2.
-egQ79OrYCs,i think its the first book
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks cool but at the same time it kinda looked like the golden compas when katara showed up in the ice berg scene
-egQ79OrYCs,"beginning is kinda fucked up, but still looks good."
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope Sokka keeps the jokes in the film or juring some of the parts i might die of boredom... depending on how good it is... idk ill hope for the best :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"I feel your pain lol, but dry your tears now. Wannabe avatars don't cry."
-egQ79OrYCs,"aahahahha
yes we do:D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Can't wait till it comes out! xD

I hope the actors will act like how the characters do in the TV-show..=)"
-egQ79OrYCs,nooo noo noo!!!!! why it wasnt enuf it was a show!
-egQ79OrYCs,Maybe I missed it but did anyone post the name of this song or don't they know?
-egQ79OrYCs,@AndyFunny22 Ahh i have watched too much Naruto and so have you ;)
-egQ79OrYCs,air makes fire more strong so technically speaking the last airbender is fucked
-egQ79OrYCs,WHAT IS THE SONG?
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope the fighting scenes are any good. I'm definetely looking forward to this movie!
-egQ79OrYCs,meh....maybe it will be good the director has messed up in the last ummmm 10 years...
-egQ79OrYCs,"Um, Zuko has no scar in this? Isn't that an important piece of symbolism for him? Also, if you look closely, none of the characters are following a particular style of martial arts, they just seem to be waving their arms around. How is it that an animated cartoon winds up with all this stuff (the creators did their homework) and the movie just kind of took the easy route? Stop translating animation into live action, Hollywood! I don't care how much new merchandise you wanna sell!"
-egQ79OrYCs,I am an Avatar fan (james camerons movie too!) and I can't wait to see this movie it's the whole first season packed into a movie awesome... LOL
-egQ79OrYCs,If m knight fucks this film up he should be shot and wats with half the cast can u say fuked up..the people who play aang and katara shud be older and the scare on zuko is so small...i have a bad feeling
-egQ79OrYCs,I already said my peace but wow!  They're some dumb ass people on here.  First off M Night is Indian.  I think it would be more racists if a Indian director hired all Indian actors to play Kung Fu roles.  The fact that a Indian director chose SOME white actors (not all white actors are in this movie) makes him less racists.  SOME of you people need to stop and think before you write stupid shit on here.  DUMB!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang, the last air-bender"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well you chosed your words bad.

LEARN GRAMMAR!"
-egQ79OrYCs,now will come a danny phantom movie and every stupid cartoon a movie in reallife -.-
-egQ79OrYCs,lol
-egQ79OrYCs,Who the hell did the casting!?
-egQ79OrYCs,man this movie only can be a hit if nickelodeon find the  Dragon Balls
-egQ79OrYCs,lol now why did they have to make him white lol when hes a Asian monk ?
-egQ79OrYCs,why the fuck is it a white kid
-egQ79OrYCs,Gary Coleman should have played the title character. Todd Bridges and the smelly corpse of Dana Plato could cameo.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I wonder if zoko's uncle will be played right, or else this movie will be a disappointment"
-egQ79OrYCs,POWER.
-egQ79OrYCs,å¾æè¶£çæ ·å­~~~
-egQ79OrYCs,"While its true theres nothing to indicate that the characters of avatar have to be asian and it is USA made, the anime was crafted based on asian culture and customs, and thus we would typically associate these aesthetics and values to the oriental descent, although this isnt an effective portrayal, i mean for example can you imagine an old white suburban businessman in ""ghetto"" attire? The same thing as putting white people in asian beftting roles."
-egQ79OrYCs,all of M night's  stuff is turrable.  with the exception of maybe the 6th sense.
-egQ79OrYCs,First people complained about Dragonball Evolution for not having asians since it is a anime...and still they do it for a american cartoon? Avatar is a cartoon made in USA not in Japan. It's understandable if they are not asians.
-egQ79OrYCs,your ignorant.
-egQ79OrYCs,"In the 1940's and 1950's white people used to put on make-up and play Native Americans.  As racist as that may seem, they were just movies.  This movies looks awesome.  I remember when M. Night used to be a premier director.  The man can make good movies.  He just lost his way.  Maybe Avatar will be his come back.  I mean look at James Cameron.  Dude was nothing before Titanic and recently his own kind of Avatar.  Maybe Avatar movies are the way to go!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@JacobPaige from what I heard Shamalan was a huge fan of the cartoon and has been working with the original creators to make this movie as close to the series as possible but of course have to give it bit of a twist on looks. I'm sure the characters will be just as loving as they are seen on Tv. After all this is just a trailer, its ment to catch your eye and would you take it serious if it looks like nothing but a joke?"
-egQ79OrYCs,looks like a fail to me...
-egQ79OrYCs,why katara and sokka are so white... and zuko is brown? Its supposed to be the inverse. hahaha but jamal is cool
-egQ79OrYCs,"@JacobPaige 

I was feeling the same sentiments while watching this trailer.  I mean, it looks really intense-but Sokka's character as well doesn't seem nearly as fun loving as he should.  There doesn't appear to be any comic relief, and that balance between the intense and the funny is what made the show so refreshing and entertaining.  I hope we're not too disappointed though because I do want to enjoy the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"it looks like they've sucked all the fun out of Aang's character. there's no sense of a fun loving prankster in any of this : (
did shamalan even watch the series? did he even try to understand the characters? : (
I really hope I'm wrong, but if i'm not, then this movie isn't going to feel like Avatar at all, it'll just feel like a mindless rehash of every other tragic hero story ever told :("
-egQ79OrYCs,"The cartoon was fun to watch, so I hope this movie will be good. :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,remember this is an m. night shyamalan film guys...so approach it with some appropriate caution and skepticism...
-egQ79OrYCs,haha id go faded !
-egQ79OrYCs,me too!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy nice111111111111111 trailer exactly to the stories
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks great.  I hope it has the comic relief of the cartoon. I never missed an episode.
-egQ79OrYCs,@047marie i agree
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie is gonna be beast!!!!!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"infernil, u must be the dumbass who thinks goku is an alien. aside from the fact that they were chinese, japanese, korean clothing and use asian martial arts movements and follow asian religions. no, why would they be asian? if we had an black superman would it be considered a race card? no, it's ok cause it's just the little asians that get insulted. this is why bruce lee couldnt find a job."
-egQ79OrYCs,nice effects!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,I think Joe Jonas would of made a better Zuko?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@EmosSayOw 
Damn straight man, I'm getting pissed that all these people are throwing the race card down.  I'm Asian and I don't give a shit.   People always have to find something to bitch about."
-egQ79OrYCs,@GodHateReligiousNuts  They're more like Indians!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Not to play the race card or anything, but avatar is kinda on a different planet."
-egQ79OrYCs,The movie looks better than I thought it would.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Being a big fan of the series, I can honestly say I am looking forward to this film. I have enjoyed Night's previous works (And I don't give a damn what you all think of him), so this should be good."
-egQ79OrYCs,LAME
-egQ79OrYCs,@TheOtakunited dude or dudett this movie will make ppl forget that crappy dragon  ball movie ever existed...can't wait !
-egQ79OrYCs,"@terror0earth

The waterbenders are supposed to be inuits/eskimos, so they aren't necessarily Asian."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah! the thing is that the creators are huge asian-art-philosophy fans... if you watch the show a lot of writing is asian calligraphy... they have cultural consultants and all... of course the martial arts moves and stuff... you should try it, the cartoon is great!! great animation and story ^^"
-egQ79OrYCs,L.M.NYC.A.O.! Now That Is Retarded! It Looks Like Something From MySpace! L.O.L.! Its All Goochy Though!
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah Me Too! Let me Know When You Find One!
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't really understand the trailer.  They keep on saying random things.  Aren't trailers supposed to give you a quick overview of the plot?  It looked good though.
-egQ79OrYCs,finally avatar what i understand.i remember when jame's avatar came out i was like wtf this is not avatar  but later i watch it and understand. i am soo happy that avatar the last air bender came out.
-egQ79OrYCs,I guess you're not a fan of the cartoon XD
-egQ79OrYCs,iroh needs a bigger beard
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aye Man, This Is Not English 101 Son! If You Can Understand What I'm Saying, That Is All That Matters! I'm Already Alright!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"You Know That For A Fact? How Do you Know, I Mean That's Great News, But How Do You Know That?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"sorry but in the cartoon the water people has dark skin, the fire guys are japanese, Aang looks clearly tibetan and the earth girl is chinese... i'm not making things up Â¬Â¬"
-egQ79OrYCs,"This looks really serious, I mean the show was to me more funny/actiony/heart warming. The movie now just looks more dramatic then anything. I really hope they do add some of the humor that I love so much from the show!"
-egQ79OrYCs,its a trilogy. 3 movies for 3 books.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I Here Ya! Well, I'm Not Familiar With M. Knight Shyalaman's Track Record & Everything, But I Hope He Or She Does Not Mess Up This Excellent Saga! I Would Be Very Disappointed If It Is Not Done Correctly! & Also, Do You Think They Would Try To Fit The Whole Saga In One Movie?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"dammit! i want another trailer! the next one better have aang speak, have appa in it, have at least a little humor idk and zuko speaking...most importantly i want aang to speak! I WANT ANOTHER TRAILER!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Two things:

1.LOOKS AWESOME

2.Where are the Asians???"
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah... that's kind of surprising... I don't want to over-think it... but... yeah the Water Tribe has dark skin, right?... and I don't know, Shyamalan is Indian and not American, so is weird to think it... but... why does the ""bad guys"" look like Middle East people?... that kind of looks kind od judgemental to me Â¬Â¬"
-egQ79OrYCs,That Is The Same Question I Was Asking Myself! I Sure Hope Not Because It Will Take Away From An Ecxellent Saga!
-egQ79OrYCs,This is a way better trailer than the other one and gives me hope that the movie might not be a failure and a disgrace to an AMAZING series. Appa better be in the movie or there's going to be major problems...>:O
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks amazing can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,one movie per book. It will be a trilogy of movies
-egQ79OrYCs,"That's better. I feel there's no need for such pointless spelling alterations. I have all three books on DVD, it's awesome! I can't wait for the movie, though I am a bit skeptical given M. Knight Shyalaman's track record... we'll just have to wait and see... also, I've looked, and I can't see Appa... (not saying he's not there, just that I can't see him)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"My Dude, What's Hard To Understand? What, Because I Changed The ""C"" For A ""K""? That's Called Ghetto Cyber Language! LOL.! Nah, I Feel You Though So I'll Write It In Proper Vocabulary So You Don't Think I'm Illiterate Or Something! What I Was Saying Is That I Am In The Process Of Watching All The Episodes From Nickalodeon. I'm Up To The Last Episode Which Is Called, ""Sozen's Comet"". You Get It Now? I Also Was Saying That I Can't Wait For The Movie To Come Out. I Love Avatar, Tjhe Last Air Bender!"
-egQ79OrYCs,i mean that looks beast because of the music in the trailer haha
-egQ79OrYCs,Shaolin Monk rules.
-egQ79OrYCs,At least this isnt as disappointing as the DBZ movie @_@ this looks promising.
-egQ79OrYCs,"So, is this going to be a summery of the series in one movie?"
-egQ79OrYCs,BTW whats the song?
-egQ79OrYCs,@okito95 you cant even see appa in this trailer. :(
-egQ79OrYCs,YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! WHAT A BEAST MOVIE!!! at first i thought m night messed up and it was gonna be horrible but it actually looks really good. i hope this is not like one of those movies where it looks beast because of the movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,i am the avatar fan. and where the hell is zuko's scar and his long hair? lol so different
-egQ79OrYCs,awesome another cabbage man supporter
-egQ79OrYCs,"dude, your spelling SUCKS! Makes it so hard to understand what you are attempting to say"
-egQ79OrYCs,"It Iz ""Appa"" Fam!!! S.M.H.!!! I Kan't Wait To Chekk Dis One Out In Da Moviez!!! AaaaYyyyyEeeee!!!!! Just Finished Watchin' All Three Bookz From Nikkalodeon Dat I Downloaded!!! Great Stuff!!! Aktually, I'm Up To Da Finale, ""Sozen'z Komet""... I'm So Anxious To Watch It, I'm Gonna Wait 'Til Da Mornin' To Chekk It Out!!! But All Three Bookz Are Excellent!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,wat a twist?! lol
-egQ79OrYCs,cause its the same actor lol
-egQ79OrYCs,Movie looks sweet. Ganna be a great movie. They could have picked alittle better for Katara but every thing else. 5 out a 5 . Any Airbender Fan will love this movie. Cant wait tell its out...
-egQ79OrYCs,anyone know what the song is called?
-egQ79OrYCs,"I wasn't sure if this movie would be any good at first, but after seeing this, I'm quite optimistic.  I know a lot of people are mad about the ethnicities of the actors, but I think they're fine.  Jackson Rathbone as Sokka just seems right..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@2:30, is that supposed to be General IRo?"
-egQ79OrYCs,seriously this movie will fail this will be the only avatar movie made dont get your hopes up
-egQ79OrYCs,"you know what made the animated series successful was it's blend of comedy and drama , but this movie just looks like its all serious. I am foreseeing an EPIC fail."
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont see em lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"there saying its going to be a ""suprise"""
-egQ79OrYCs,nope onlii book 1 soon there gonna be the last airbender 2 ect ect
-egQ79OrYCs,she looks like a little kid.... saying you want to fck her doesnt say anything except that your either a ten year old or just plain discusting
-egQ79OrYCs,There will be 1 movie for every season of the cartoon. There were 3 seasons...so there will be 3 movies. This first one is based only on season 1. :)
-egQ79OrYCs,"""wait a miniute..theres someone missing..someone very important....WHEREz  MOMO.?!"" hahahaha XD
cant wait til this comes out...I'm juss too excited.!"
-egQ79OrYCs,finally!! this is the avatar i wanted to see
-egQ79OrYCs,omfg catara is so hot! i wanna fk with she!!! omfgg hoot hottt
-egQ79OrYCs,Are Momo and Appa in the movie?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Seriously dude, quit race-baiting and go back to trolling 4chan... No one is raising to your attempts to start arguments when you're not even commenting on the serious issues surrounding this movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,fuck mannn wanna see thisss
-egQ79OrYCs,LMAO...sooo true
-egQ79OrYCs,fuck you all
-egQ79OrYCs,you said it!
-egQ79OrYCs,@grayninja62 zuko is the kid from slumdog millionaire
-egQ79OrYCs,"water benders = Eskimos
Fire Benders = Japanese
Earth Benders = Chinese
Air Benders = Monks 
What the hell is wrong with this movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Why the hell does everyone have to be white, I loved avatar but this movie is gonna suck.."
-egQ79OrYCs,i liked the series but idk about this movie something dosn't feel right
-egQ79OrYCs,Why don't they show aang's funny side or else the movie will be bad! My hope is up!
-egQ79OrYCs,i really hate the kid they picked to play Aang...shoulda taken austin crain!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hate how Aang and Katara look like they're 10 years old. It kinda ruins the romantic tension between them, if there will be any in this movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,I want to see what that buffalo looks like in CGI. I hope he's in it. My cousin's kids loved the series.
-egQ79OrYCs,Notice how almost everyone is white? In the cartoon no one was white. That's one thing messed up. I hope they get the rest of the movie right for the most part. I'm really looking forward to this and I hope it's not disappointing.
-egQ79OrYCs,"This will hopefully be a good movie, as long as shyamalaan doesnt mess it up like he did his other movies"
-egQ79OrYCs,why does ang gotta be such an ugly child? lol
-egQ79OrYCs,Lets jus hope its not like dragonball
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope this movie will be good cuz i luv the cartoon version i never stop watchin it but i rly hope this movie will popular like AVATAR wont that be awesome!
-egQ79OrYCs,How so?
-egQ79OrYCs,"The movie looks good, but you can already see  its messing up the story of the show."
-egQ79OrYCs,It better not suck rock cuz i like da cartoon n da cartoon is good
-egQ79OrYCs,"Appa is shown in the TV spot. The clip where aang is turning around in a slow. His in the upper left corner turning around,"
-egQ79OrYCs,i wonder if they'll include appa. that would be interesting to see on the big screen
-egQ79OrYCs,@oglocz1far from naruto
-egQ79OrYCs,this could be the best anime that got turn into a movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think is that lady from the water tribe
the legendary girl...its been awhile i forgot"
-egQ79OrYCs,is this real?
-egQ79OrYCs,to bad ur wrong anime means japanese comics turn into cartoon i read it in wiki.
-egQ79OrYCs,"this actually looks pretty true to the story so far, while the dragonball movie looked shitty from the start...in my opinion"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Gahhhh!!! I think it will be terrible because
I'm sorry but not many people had diffrent colored skin!!! I hate how movies turn something totally AWSOME into something totally HORRIBLE and STUPID!!!!! sorry if you feel diffrent but come on!!! the avatar's tatoo wasn't even the same color or solid for that matter! the maker of the move sucks because they changed all of the best stuff!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,wow the fire bender guy is brown and the aang is white along with the 2 water benders -.- gonna be like dragonball z movie
-egQ79OrYCs,they dont seem to portray the same Ang in the anime in this movie. He's more easygoing and playful in the anime and so serious here. Maybe its just the trailer idk
-egQ79OrYCs,"Most of my concerns is how they will shrink long story of the episodes in to one movie and not fuck it up. How will they manage pace of the movie, so that it dont feel rushed, or too circumsized, cause it could lack alot of scenes frome episodes."
-egQ79OrYCs,@AyanamisSlave fire nation is Indian. especially the dude from slumdog millionaire is playing the prince or whatever.
-egQ79OrYCs,Is that sarcasm?
-egQ79OrYCs,who said avatar was for little kids?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@tyrantcodex002, dude anime is just a way to describe the way it looks, has nothing to do with japan"
-egQ79OrYCs,@kiaza70 u cant call it anime. anime is from Japanese
-egQ79OrYCs,um i read ur comment and its stupid i'm making sense and u r not.. cartoon clothing doesnt look good in real life. and the clothes looks good
-egQ79OrYCs,"good point, i have a qualm though with them making uncle look skinny and not fat..now that was just taking it too far lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,wow they went nd fucked up aangs tat's that bad how hard is it to make a solid fucking arrow? otherwise this movie look so badass
-egQ79OrYCs,"idk i do want them to be Asian the fire nation looked the most like Asian's people but there not and Sokka and katara should be Indian NOT white like Aang who is the only one who can pull of being white Here is the race that should be for all the main characters:
Aang- White or Asian 
Katara and Sokka- indan
Zuko: Asian 
hope you can agree with me"
-egQ79OrYCs,The only kewl part is when he goes into his avatar state!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Im srry but NONE of YOU are making any sense! The only one tht i can honestly say makes sense is 
GodHateReligiousNuts.....AND second asians do NOT sux at making movies due to the fact tht The Matrix was directed by a asian and in conclusion the cartoon Avatar the Last Airbender there were way more comedy and less seriousness and tht romantic shit was at the min. soo.......jst come to the conclusion tht this movie is gonna sux worse then The Happening......"
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol its fiction!  You're arguing in non-relevant terms.  Asian, Chinese, non of that has any relevance to 'the fire nation' or 'the water tribes'."
-egQ79OrYCs,Shyamalan is just bad at casting.
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang seems too serious in the trailer almost Emo even. in the cartoon he was very playful and adventurous.  I hope its just because the tone of the trailer but I have a feeling this movies not going live up to the cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,The trailer looks good. I just wish they got a better cast.
-egQ79OrYCs,"the bad girl fire princess is probably Azula also Mai, Mai's mom, Zuko, Ozai and many other fire nation people look like there Asian Race"
-egQ79OrYCs,"one half of me says: this movie will propably be ok. The other half says: if they redo the casting, it propably would be better."
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow, so avatar came out and somebody thought, ""Maybe we should release avatar the next air bender."" god that is bad, i can't even imagine how bad this will suck."
-egQ79OrYCs,i have feeling this is going to suck
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang looks like he has the emotion of a door
-egQ79OrYCs,@lovelyisme52 Well Shyamalan said he was going to tone down some of the humor a bit (though I worry about how much he'll do so).
-egQ79OrYCs,Y momo??
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ugh the person they chose for katara is so ugly, and aren't theey supposed to have darker skin?
The person who plays Aang looks good though"
-egQ79OrYCs,where the hell is appa???the bison?? c'mon guys..where is it??
-egQ79OrYCs,"I saw the cartoon , I am pressed to remember any of the cartoons characters as being asian race . Please tell me who was drawn with asian eyes ? I can only think of the bad girl fire princess ."
-egQ79OrYCs,where the hell is appa???
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm actually surprised the special effects and costumes look pretty good, though I doubt they'll be able to do Azula or Ozai justice. Grey Delisle and Mark Hamill are just too awesome"
-egQ79OrYCs,I think it must be hard to find good asian actors ;3
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks hilarious
-egQ79OrYCs,lol the firebenders are Indian
-egQ79OrYCs,the moon goddess looks pretty 1:22
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is Avatar 
This is badass
Just wish Zuko's scar was a bit bigger like in the animation
BTW Zuko rulz"
-egQ79OrYCs,"holy shit looks badass, makes me want to watch the cartoon since I never have"
-egQ79OrYCs,"This movie should have been named ""Avatar"", fuck cameron."
-egQ79OrYCs,Why is the cast all white people and durkas?  I didn't see one asian.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Don't know as much, if anything at all about this movie as you guys, but it looks to be like a good movie to see. Can't wait."
-egQ79OrYCs,"now, how exactly am i being racist for calling out Hollywood's refusal in giving asians (or color people in general) leading roles. another good example that proves my point is ""21"".  I am open minded towards other's views, but please give me explanation behind your reasoning as opposed to throwing out this tagline."
-egQ79OrYCs,"WOW... it looks so serious 0_0
Still as far as im concerned THIS is the Avatar i've been waiting for! xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,at the very end of book 3 during sozins comet
-egQ79OrYCs,i was just saying by the looks of the trailer he was in control then went into the avatar state. my opinion of course. and he mastered it right at the last part of 2. he opened the last chakra in the middle of battle with azula and the di li and he went into the avatar state and was about to do an attack when azula snuck up from behind and zapped him causing him to be unable to use the avatar state until a hit to the scar where she zapped him triggered it
-egQ79OrYCs,...What the Hell!? Why the Hell is Zuko's Scar so effing Small!?!?!?!?!?!? Why does it seem like Aang's so effing Depressed!? He's supposed to be all Super-Happy and Hyper! Got-danged friggin' ....-goes into corner muttering nonsensical curses-
-egQ79OrYCs,well lets hope the kid who plays Aang doesnt grow up to be a weird looking goober
-egQ79OrYCs,looks very interesting
-egQ79OrYCs,one thing i thought was weird is the fact that they show him sommoning the avatar state at will when he didnt master it until the end of book 2
-egQ79OrYCs,"idiot, youve changed your point now. im not gonna bother with you, i really do hate idiots."
-egQ79OrYCs,does anybody know music theme from this trailer?
-egQ79OrYCs,OMFG ....goosebumps!!!! I can't wait to see this!! i mean ... the visual effects really cool. i wish it'll be a great movie to watch!!
-egQ79OrYCs,I think Dev Patel will make a great Zuko. He can pull off the evil look. Even without the burn. I'm looking forward to this movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,@tmksk ---they said it is going to take up to 6 years to complete the trilogy.
-egQ79OrYCs,love how you trolls are judging the movie even when it isn't out yet.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I was worried that this movie was going to be really bad, but now I think there is hope... It won't be really good, but it won't be that bad either...
I liked the series though, so just like Negrodamus40 said I will go and check out how much messed up it turned out XD If it's gonna be released in Hungary at all..."
-egQ79OrYCs,this is gonig to be a triology i can see it its gonig to be book one:water
-egQ79OrYCs,gotta admit its funny. abit.
-egQ79OrYCs,I had fun writing the script... It was worth it.
-egQ79OrYCs,now isnt that nicer. dun have to write a whole script to say that now dont we.  n ty for explaining.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm just saying... Toph is my favorite Avatar Character. But I understand that there is no place for her in movie one just like there was no place for her in Season one. 

Like I said before. Watch ""The Last Airbender"" Make sure you help it make its money so they do a sequel. There is when you will see Toph on the big screen."
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah that;s a real good one, why dont you just go make a book out of it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"What will Toph do in this movie? 

Toph: ""Hey dunderheads... Anyone looking for an Earthbender?""
Aang: ""Not really... we're focused on Waterbending right now.. We're going to the north pole.""
Toph: ""Oh.. uh.. well call me when you need an earthbender""
Sokka: ""That probably won't be until Movie 2.""
Toph: ""Right... just like the TV Series... Not sure why I'm here so earlier than I'm supposed to be...""
Aang: ""Yea... go away."""
-egQ79OrYCs,"Nope, just because he looks Japanese doesn't mean he is, the producer that made this did not depict it on Japanese culture only Chinese, it even says it on the Bonus Disc of ATLA. They even eat chinese food and wear chinese clothing such as: Qipao, Cheongsam, Chinese Jackets and Chinese Robes."
-egQ79OrYCs,die moet ik echt zien ik heb alle tekefilms ook gezien en volgens mij is het presies het zelfde
-egQ79OrYCs,really?? which part?? cant see him.. darn I just wanna hug that giant fluffly bicen! *searching for oppa*
-egQ79OrYCs,yea the creatures were the best :)
-egQ79OrYCs,she's my favourite girl! go toph! oh dun tell me shes not in the movie.. is she? cause she HAVE to be in it.. SHE HAVE toooooo...
-egQ79OrYCs,"I cant wait :D 
The trailer is pretty serious - it would be interesting to see if they mix in any humour like the cartoon.  I hope they have Sokka on cactus juice in the next film..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@LeviathanZr6  yeah,  I think air looks weak too..
and earth bending is just so rocking awesome.. \m/ \m/"
-egQ79OrYCs,1:04 thats slum dog millionaire :|
-egQ79OrYCs,1:35 SCORE!
-egQ79OrYCs,"the person who plays zuko,
is he the one from slumdog millionaire??/"
-egQ79OrYCs,Japan is part of Asia. Get your facts right.
-egQ79OrYCs,So far it looks pretty good. pretty much had the same storyline for the cartoon. i just hope M. Knight Shyamalan doesnt mess things up for the loyal fans. only time will tell this story
-egQ79OrYCs,"@thehomieDaniel, Apparently, some people have no idea that there's a lot of races all over Asia. They thought Asia is a race."
-egQ79OrYCs,I got nothing against Zuko being Indian or Sikh or whichever race. But I really3 feel he should be some1 handsomer!!! :P
-egQ79OrYCs,"yay!!
Nice casting eh!!
I like the one who will act as Zuko!!
and Katara!
I think the Actor that will act as Ang is NEW??"
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm betting this is gonna be awesome!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"they all should be asian...its actually offencive that hollywood does not put asians in lead roles....

sad...just like dragon ball the movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,I totally agree with you :)
-egQ79OrYCs,@zangeitzu karate is not from korea its from japan..taekwondo is from korea
-egQ79OrYCs,"Hey I know, let's get a guy who looks NOTHING like Zuko, give him a full head of hair, and sell it!  Nothing spells money like pissing on people and telling them it's raining!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"please please please be good, dont be like dragonball (ARGGHH)."
-egQ79OrYCs,no it's not. lol =D
-egQ79OrYCs,"O Please God, make this movie as good as this trailer shows... cool effects btw..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@tharwpoop It's from M. Night Shyamalan production, i'm pretty sure he won't let stuff be ruined, he takes his movies to the next level, hopefully he did the same with this one! Let's wait to see ^^"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@erickit007 yes, there will be a twist at the end.. and the twist is.. 

THAT ITS REALLY A TV SHOW... 

I'm calling it now that's the twist... :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,say whaaat? where'd you get that info from? That's half the story in my opinion.
-egQ79OrYCs,lol what with all these adaptations or remakes? nothing original is coming out? well this looks really good hopefully they dont mess this anime up like they did Dragonball evolution!
-egQ79OrYCs,i think her name was toph. her character was so cool xD
-egQ79OrYCs,"in my experience,
Shymalan nearly always disappoints"
-egQ79OrYCs,I think that they fking chose the wrong people for this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"when i saw the first trailer i was like""what? is this a good idea?""

but now that ive seen this newer trailer, i have a feeling that this may just be awesome 

AVATAR STATE! YIP! YIP!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I wanna see some bloodbending, and I wanna see the blind girl, I forgot her name it's been so long...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol, they can't name it avatar :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,"all the clips in the trailer are from the first book in the series, and someone told me they were sure they'd seen the crew stating its a trilogy somewhere. the trailer really points at it being a trilogy."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I lost all faith in movie adaptations a long time ago.  However, Lord of the Rings proved that greatness can be achieved."
-egQ79OrYCs,it is the battle at the north pole i wonder if they gonna split up the movies or just one
-egQ79OrYCs,lol the trailer is pretty awesome but like ppl said the cast is too or too middle eastern looking still even with the cast its pretty cool and i think the best cast right now is yue. sokka looks mad pussy
-egQ79OrYCs,Man if they are able to F*ck this awesome story up i will lose all my faith in Hollywood :P
-egQ79OrYCs,"i agree completely, but then again. This movie as a whole has a more serious characters, a more serious plot, for which they probably require to alter the personalities a bit.

i am too a bit disappointed, but they have done it since forever with many movies"
-egQ79OrYCs,You don't get his point...
-egQ79OrYCs,"my dear lord, 9 hours ago, at midnight this trailer had 1700 comments, and 144.500 views.. look at it now o.O anyway, stop fussing over aang, the actors not the worst racially, katara would be the worst :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Idk about the kid they picked for Ang, there doesnt seem to be enough joy and hapiness in his eyes... the character of Ang is fun loving and care free... this kid seems too serious"
-egQ79OrYCs,wind breaker
-egQ79OrYCs,"hey the Movie seems so good !

I'm a pure Asian and i don't see any ""racist issue""in the movie. 
well, even the characters are factually not so right but they portray it so good same as the origin (Asian cartoon) series.

please don't pre-judge the movie.

instead, judge it after you watch it!

lets see what you freaking judgmental people can say!"
-egQ79OrYCs,i think they pick the perfect person for Ang. Looks just like the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,@KittenzAV2 exactly!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@9527says in the cartoons its only implied he is asian because he is monk like in nature... he doesnt have slanty eyes, or even a very asian voice.... ""we americans"" is the cartoon not made in America?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"for those who are arguing what cultures influence the show. the main point is that aang, katara, and zuko are obviously not white.  aang is an asian sounding name and his attire is of east asian monk influence. this movie is racist because they refuse to cast people of color as the starring roles and dont use ""theres a profit motive"" to argue this point because the cartoon series did well with non white stars"
-egQ79OrYCs,not sure i like the casting of aang...and kataras hair is different  which is kinda gay...plus zukos scar is kinda small
-egQ79OrYCs,"@takerukari
Apology accepted. No hard feelings.
Yeah, China has definitely contributed its share of culture and ideas to the world, and they have also been oppressed themselves. My main goal was to compare the air nomads to Tibet, which I think we have somewhat agreed on.
Anyway, I am quite excited to see this movie. =]"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Hahahaha! They couldn't call this movie Avatar^^
I don't like the cartoon. It's so boring....."
-egQ79OrYCs,thought it sounded stupid but this preview looks pretty good
-egQ79OrYCs,@takerukari it's based off a nikelodeon show... There are more than 4 nations in the world... You are looking to deep in this.  You seem smart so why not direct your thoughts to something a little more helpful... I am sorry I called you a faggot... Don't take it personal...
-egQ79OrYCs,"I am quite sure there are other influences by other cultures too and I did not say that it wasn't influenced by other cultures. All I said was that it was influenced a lot by Chinese culture.

And no, I am not trying to make it sound like I am yelling at you, I am just making a point that is all. If I did sound like I was trying to yell at you or something. I'm sorry."
-egQ79OrYCs,slow motion much?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrPunchface
I'm not, and I'm not the one being a faggot, I watched it back then because it was good. I didn't try speculating anything about the show except that it was good. Here comes a movie and then boom the  fire nation is Indian... the fire nation is Chinese *rolls eyes*

Defend this bullshit? are you talking to me or were your replies misdirected to me?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@takerukari
Really I don't think I am being that offensive. In fact, I have been much more polite to you than you have been to me. I took back my comparison of China to the firebenders, and its not like I denied that America has done awful things as well.
Anyway, I don't think China should get full credit for influencing the show. It has but Buddhism which influences the show a lot was developed in India. Also, you mentioned the moon goddess as being Chinese, but Inuit culture likely has one 2."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheWhiteStripes3 
Waterbenders had bloodbending too. The more advanced ones could bend the water inside the human body...Yay for watching the entire avatar series in one sitting from boredom!

And your wrong, air benders had Fartbending! Never has such a flatulent stench been overcome(Works best when combined with fire bending :P)"
-egQ79OrYCs,cool.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@takerukari seriously... are you going to be a faggot about a show on nikelodeon that is awesome... are you going to write a fucking book about how you are offended... I bet you are going to come up with something smart to say to defend this bullshit, but truth is... you are an idiot... I am from America too.  I am just not.... well, you"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheWhiteStripes3
Only offended me because you are speculating in an offending way. I could quickly say that the Fire Nation is America based on the geographical location(and I am from America >.>)... and the Earth Kingdom being China based on geographical location.

Considering I know that all four nations contain Chinese concepts one way or another. I choose not to say the fire nation is Indian or whatever. Though the air Nomads may contain parts of Tibet (I would admit that much.)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yea, this is gonna be another Dragonball Evolution movie. Just sad.

and M. Night Shaymalan..... oh no. there's gonna be a twist. jokes on you. The avatar turns out to be Stephen Colbert."
-egQ79OrYCs,How come the ones who are suppose to have blue eyes have brown and vice versa...
-egQ79OrYCs,heh all i wanna see is the earth benders the animation seems good enough to cover up the bad choice of actors XD
-egQ79OrYCs,"Haha, well the waterbenders always had ice bending too. 
Some firebenders have lighteningbending. And a couple earthbenders have metalbending. What else so airbenders have? Cloudbending? Useless.."
-egQ79OrYCs,@666melodeath666 i hope there are in it. There one of the main parts of the movie
-egQ79OrYCs,@TVANO12345 same here that was crazy but she doesnt use it tho. I think she should have used it
-egQ79OrYCs,"bullshit.
hate it already."
-egQ79OrYCs,@TVANO12345 Before the puppet master.. I felt the water tribe was underpowered... ( I wondered if they could control bodily fluids) I think the idea of blood bending was a stroke of genius and really gave the water tribe some power!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@takerukari
Ok, you make a valid point about the moon goddess and chinese folklore but that doesn't make my original point invalid. We are all just speculating here. I am very sure that the Avatar and the way he is reincarnated and chosen was inspired by the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhism. However, I didnt mean to offend you by saying the Chinese are like firebenders for oppressing the Tibetans. That is kind of a far-fetched comparison I admit. (I assume I offended you based on your response)"
-egQ79OrYCs,nooooo i think they kinda killed it damn was expecting to much then damit whyyyy did they have to make the avatar look like a lil bitch and for the prince to look like a dirty bitch.... what a let down i'll still watch it though
-egQ79OrYCs,"@
TheWhiteStripes3 

Because the way I see it 
fire-America
earth - China"
-egQ79OrYCs,god dammit is it really that hard to find some asian kids for this movie i mean fucking katara and sokka are white and zuko's the one who's brown and scarless the effects look decent but where's appa or momo? i think this movie would be just another disappointment hope i'm wrong
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ TheWhiteStripes3
1: You ignored what I just said, the whole story contains concept of which came from China. Even if the water tribe is in the north and south poles, it doesn't excuse the fact that it contains the folklore of the moon goddess and the push and pull of the waves.
2: have you ever looked at the world of the show? Have you notice how the fire nation is in the West? HINT HINT, the Earth Kingdom in the East. Is it saying America is the evil one...?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Aang is supposed to be 12 numbnuts.
-egQ79OrYCs,He is supposed to be around 12
-egQ79OrYCs,boy looks too young... maybe go to the 14/15 range?
-egQ79OrYCs,ahh thanks. well that makes me feel better about it. still wish they hadn't picked her. her voice doesn't seem to match the mature Katara voice from the cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,The cantoon series is superb and I'm was hooked to it....all thks to my little boy.
-egQ79OrYCs,lol I know right? I hope this movie isn't all serious and crap. I loved the humor in the anime show.
-egQ79OrYCs,holy cow holy cow holy cow. Thanks for this movie for me. holy cow
-egQ79OrYCs,"so coooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The cast looks great, except for Iroh (if that's him). As expected, it will not be named ""Avatar"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"does anybody but me notice that Katara's hair for the show is season 3 hair?

For the first 2 seasons her hair was in a braid not down like it is in the trailer. they obviously only took her season 3 hair and then screwed it up so bad that it's bad.

I like the movie trailer though. it looks so cool. I still will be a big fan for the cartoon (and it is a CARTOON not and anime since it was made in America) even if the movie sucks like the Dragon Ball movie did."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Aang, Why so serious?  :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,shit looks tight..
-egQ79OrYCs,"you DO realize that it's a show created by ""white"" people so of course it's ""white."" they only took the concepts that inspired them from many asian cultures for the show."
-egQ79OrYCs,"You people can complain all you want but I think that kid looks like Aang. As much as a real person can anyway. I'm pretty sure professional filmmakers know better than the average youtuber. Keep in mind that Shyamalan didn't necessarily WANT to make all the changes that he made. He might not have had any choice. A director has creative control but the producers tell him what the 'profit motive' will allow, and what it will not."
-egQ79OrYCs,"they only can't call the movie title the avatar because it would confuse people who haven't seen the trailer with james cameron's avatar. 

plus technically the creators of the show had dibbs on the name first so they probably have more rights to it than cameron does.

i am almost positive that they can call roku avatar roku in the film just not on the movie title."
-egQ79OrYCs,if he's not Caucasian then why is he so white in the cartoon? Also the original creators do have a say in the movie so they probably told the director who he should pick for Aang.
-egQ79OrYCs,looks good...hope they don't screw it up!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant wait.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@0hourth 
Where in the series does it specify that he's not? 
It's a fictional series, with fictional races. 
It's up to Shyamalan to interpret that as he pleases."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@takerukari 
Haha, how are the water tribes Chinese? They live at the poles. In real life people don't live at the poles but the people most similar to the waterbenders would be inuits/eskimos, not Chinese."
-egQ79OrYCs,"i never really paid attention to the ethnicity. i only saw them as fire, earth, water, and wind so it isnt too big of a deal for me.  i understand what you mean though.  another thing though, hopefully they dont crunch everything up into one movie, although they sometimes do.  ill keep my mind open until the movie comes out and fully review it after i watch it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The whole show contains Chinese concepts... I am quite sure all the tribes contain something of Chinese descent whether it be religion, folklore, or culture.

So no, the fire nation isn't just China.. the northern and water tribe... the earth kingdom, and the air nomads are also China."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@twilightdonut 
Don't worry about the actors playing Zuko and Iroh. They are amazing and I guarantee they will become their characters. Even if they don't look like Zuko and Iroh now."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I feel your pain. I'm a black American and M.Night always does that. He use to be one of my favorite directors,  but now, I don't know. To some extent, I feel he's just sold out. He should have more Indian people in his film, but I guess he thinks Westerners won't buy. I would have liked it more if more brown skinned people were in the film."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@JonnyRocketfingers7 
Yeah, haha. I'm white but I was definitely looking forward to seeing a pretty dark-skinned Katara. Not this white girl whose acting isn't very impressive. Same thing goes for Sokka, except for the 'pretty' part."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mynameiskuwis 
You're right. The air nomads are like Tibetans because the Avatar is inspired by the Dalai Lama. Since China has been oppressing Tibet for quite some time, you could say The Fire Nation is like China. I think that's where the show's creators got some of their ideas anyway."
-egQ79OrYCs,@LamarApple Pie. Dude playing Zuko is Asian. He's from India but i know what u mean. U mean like Eastern Asia right?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@JonnyRocketfingers7 they are =] lol
if you watch the teaser trailer you see appa in it, but he's kinda in the background, but he's there lol momo will be too"
-egQ79OrYCs,wow that movie looks stupid
-egQ79OrYCs,i no avtar is sorta chessey BUT WTF katra is not that skin color and zoco looks like he is from indea rlly and ang well he looks pretty good but the people and WHERE THE F IS ZOCOS SCARE ON HAFE OF HIS FACE hopeful this wont be a tolly train reck
-egQ79OrYCs,i agree.  people are complaining that the characters in the movie dont look like the the characters in the cartoon.  big fricken deal.  its close enough.
-egQ79OrYCs,"ohh oh.. Hollywood fails at live action movie again! this just makes me think.. desprate Hollywood, whats will you ruin for us next.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow. this looks gay as hell. i mean, he doesn't look like the cartoon avatar in the least bit, i mean he looks like he's freakin 8. and i think this should've just stayed as a cartoon."
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie looks sweet. it looks like will be WAY better than Dragon Ball Evolution
-egQ79OrYCs,i mean setting was in india
-egQ79OrYCs,well i think he is because he was the main character in slumdog millionaire and the plot was in india
-egQ79OrYCs,Let the movies be the movie - as for what you think the characters should be - either make your own movies or build a bridge and get over it.
-egQ79OrYCs,Wow this looks like an amazing adaption of the tv series! Everything so far seems very true to the show! If you haven't noticed reading this so far I'm really excited to watch this!
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko looks indian
-egQ79OrYCs,"well i guess you canÂ´t call avatar anymore, isnÂ´t that  right mr. james cameron"
-egQ79OrYCs,@mynameiskuwis I agree with you. i think hollywood is still kinda racist.
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara's pretty cute imo
-egQ79OrYCs,"I haven't watched the TV series, but I think this is going to be a pretty cool movie. I plan on seeing it in theaters."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yea, I meant to list more diverse people, but I couldn't think of anything
earth are Chinese
fire are Japanese
water are native American type/Eskimo type (not to be racist I'm having major brain fart over research paper...)
Air: not so sure XD 
Does island nation destroy giant mainland ring any bells?"
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont think it will be as good as the cartoon just like how DBZ is one of the greatest cartoons ever made but the movie was not that good
-egQ79OrYCs,Previews like this always give me the shivers.
-egQ79OrYCs,"sooo hyped :D
i am beyond excited"
-egQ79OrYCs,omg i just noticed that...i sure hope he is there and momo later on
-egQ79OrYCs,-yawns- I seem to be growing bored from your brainless ranting. I am done arguing with an idiotic pest. You are nothing but a waste of time.
-egQ79OrYCs,"LOL! You are just picking out the little things, arent you? Just because you have nothing better to write. Have you ever heard of typos? I bet not. I suggest you pick up a dictionary and find the meaning to that term. By the way, your childish insults are meaningless. Grammatical errors? HA! Shea right! That is coming from someone who clearly doesnt know the usage of commas and periods."
-egQ79OrYCs,i did not see appa
-egQ79OrYCs,"if u never watched the tv show u will like the movie!
But i have and i hope that this movie doesnt cut out or take away much! but u know how movies that are tv shows go!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang was pretty much both. He gets very serious when he's in battles, but when he's flying around or just walking with sokka and katara, he jokes around and is playful.."
-egQ79OrYCs,Why is it all White people In a chinese looking film or series w/e
-egQ79OrYCs,i keep thinking that girl at 1:22 is jessica alba from fantastic four lol.
-egQ79OrYCs,@Gdizzle157 -  i disagree. dragonball was gonna be crap and everyone knew it.  at no point during these trailer does my bullsh*t meter go off. the actors faces  look a little different? cry me a river.
-egQ79OrYCs,please just 1 chinese dude and ill go watch it
-egQ79OrYCs,Dragonball was made by a no name director who knew as little about the series as he could. M. Night isn't White. He's a fan of the series and it's an American anime anyway. As far as I'm concerned he has every right to make this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,You're right they should've just slapped some tempur paint on there and be done with it...
-egQ79OrYCs,Really cant wait to see this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"@nardo1718 
each book is going to be a seperate movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,the stuntman for this movie lives right next to meh
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is just book one, he started writing the second one at the start of the shooting of this one. So we can look forward to three movies"
-egQ79OrYCs,dragon ball evolution... do i have to say more
-egQ79OrYCs,lol u racist monster
-egQ79OrYCs,"White people and Indians, its supposed to be the Chinese, and Japanese"
-egQ79OrYCs,he looks pretty chubby...
-egQ79OrYCs,"Strong argument... if you don't consider the fact that were so dam technologically advanced that a voice-over some others moving lips is very very plausible and in fact may have been the best way to go...To this day people always seem to misunderstand racial plight, race relations have never been strong and if I'm correct, the creators of the show had no input on the selection of the cast. They were extremely disappointed, but hey no movie's prefect."
-egQ79OrYCs,lol fail
-egQ79OrYCs,"...it was a joke

:("
-egQ79OrYCs,"Um, no, it's about Avatar, the last airbender. Hence the name."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Iroh doesn't look right at all, but I guess I'll have to wait to see it before I judge how good of an Iroh he makes"
-egQ79OrYCs,i loled. i hope you knew what you were saying haha.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Very excited. I watched the TV show, but never saw the last season   :(

It will be cool to see everything in realistic animations and graphics rather than cartoons. I can't wait for appa!"
-egQ79OrYCs,i don't know bout this... first dragon ball now this... stop ruining my child hood!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"wait a minute...

WHERE ARE THE BLUE PEOPLE?!?"
-egQ79OrYCs,i think Zoey Saldana would be good 4 katara
-egQ79OrYCs,"im white but i agree lol
ive always imagine dthem as asians xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I actually thought Dev Patel was going to be a horrible looking Zuko, but now that I look at it, he looks pretty badass, at 56 his eyes look like hes high."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Appa IS in the second trailer... only not visible without proper magnification 

lastairbenderfans-dot-com/imag es/gallery/trailer_41.jpg 

next to the sunlight.. and i don't see momo anywhere"
-egQ79OrYCs,"hey

we hav to address this issue of asians bein thrown aside and being replaced wit white actors

lol jk"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I dont know about yall, but im siked to see this movie. Ever since the first episode aired, I always wanted to see what it would look like in real life or in a movie. And here it is. I HOPE this isnt a bust, I hope shyamalan gives us a show, james cameron style."
-egQ79OrYCs,You and me both [agree]
-egQ79OrYCs,not really.
-egQ79OrYCs,"appa is on the mountain.. you can see sunlight beside him

lastairbenderfans-dot-com/images/gallery/trailer_41.jpg"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i know for a fact that appa will be in it, he's in the background of the superbowl spot trailer"
-egQ79OrYCs,this director has been putting his name to be part of the big name directors but his few last movies been FAIL...I hope this is not another FAIL!
-egQ79OrYCs,What? No Appa? No flying furry animal? I'm saddened by this :(
-egQ79OrYCs,"they made TRANSFORMERS, DRAGONBALL,TEKKEN&THE LAST AIRBENDER real!!!!!!!!!!! y not NARUTO!!!!!!!!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"No, by ""Hindu"" I was just making a race discrepncy from American ""Indians"" (thanks to that overly arrogant Columbus, everyone gets confused)  lol       But yes, I TOTALLY agree about the buddism.   ESPECIALLY the whole ""avatar/buddah"" thing."
-egQ79OrYCs,@Slodogk appa is in trailer 1
-egQ79OrYCs,the budget didnt allow for appa...
-egQ79OrYCs,"wait, are they trying to make a TV show that has aired four seasons into a two hour movie??? They are probably  gonna kill Avatar >:("
-egQ79OrYCs,Listening fail...
-egQ79OrYCs,looks like it's going to be a good movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,i think the director of this should make a naruto movie
-egQ79OrYCs,not bad.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah, Appa is in the movie. He's can't be seen in this trailer, but there's a trailer that shows Appa in the upper left corner."
-egQ79OrYCs,where'e appa?
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow, i like a lot of things shown from this trailer. although it looks like whoever plays zuko (did i spell it right?) has a black eye lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,kung fu effects fail
-egQ79OrYCs,Is Appa in this movie? D:
-egQ79OrYCs,lol
-egQ79OrYCs,inuits arent fucking white and the fire nation and aang (at the least) were supposed to be asian. looks like a kiddie flic
-egQ79OrYCs,TV show original name : Avatar lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"now that i see a decent trailer i might go see this movie just because

it should at least have the potential to give me SOME form of entertainment when i go see it."
-egQ79OrYCs,Must watch this.
-egQ79OrYCs,i always love the cartoon one but when i heard about this movie i was so happy because i love action movies and this movie turned out to be good
-egQ79OrYCs,"aang looks skinny, give him some abbs make him lil buf atleast .the girl playin katara is ugly,"
-egQ79OrYCs,I know what movie I wont be watching
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah like captain planet
-egQ79OrYCs,"His real name is Aang, actually..."
-egQ79OrYCs,his name is aang.....
-egQ79OrYCs,"hey i remember watching when i was like 12 i would gladly see this, looks like a good movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really think it would have been neat to have each of the four races be depicted by a different Earthen race. If it was ME, I would do: Water Nation: Native American Indians, Wind: Hendu India people, Earth: Black, and Fire: Japanese/Chinese. 

But then, in this incredibly racest country, everyone would say you were trying to depict the Japanese as evil, and the Black people as blockheaded (let's face it, most of the earth nation ARE blockheaded. )"
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh didn't notice that. But still I think a lot of people are getting the same buzz about this movie though. I'm not setting my expectations too high.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really want to see this movie so badly, I don't care about the whole argument about who is asian and purple. As long as they can do what an actor is suppose to do then let them go on being ""white"" and as for the comment with the DBZ movie I alway thought Goku was white...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"i agree, i think uncle iroh was a horrible choice as well. i was a big fan of the animated series and am very disappointed. but still we will have to see how it goes."
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh no no another Transformer 2! Full of pointless explosions and flashes and a horrible plot. = P
-egQ79OrYCs,"LMFAO! Trolling? HA! First of, I wasn't even trying. Second, poetry? are you blind or maybe just incoherent? I really suggest you just stop and actually realize that my username is NOTHING MORE than just a  username. Lastly, you don't even know me to recognize my taste in films. So, seriously stop being so inane with your illiteratecy."
-egQ79OrYCs,I figure this movie is going to be a huge screw up. The character choice is poor Sokka and Katara look weird. Especially that Sokka doesn't even look asian. Like Nebula Lily noted there is no Momo or Appa shown.
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't have many hopes for this movie. But I'll give it a chance to at least be an okay movie. I'll keep my expectations low enough hat I won't be disappointed one way or the other.
-egQ79OrYCs,WHERE IS MOMO AND APPA!? That's all I wanna know XD lol. I'm worried though the show had so much humor and such well rounded characters...that's not really coming off in the trailers...well heres to hoping *crosses fingers*
-egQ79OrYCs,oh no...dont tell me this gana be a as big as a fail as the DBZ movie with that white goku...
-egQ79OrYCs,yah where's momo?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Minus the cool effects, this movie looks like it'll be a cheesy mess.  Not upset about the casting, however, it's obvious that the creators were portraying are more culturally/ethnically diverse group of characters, let's not deny it.  Saying the movie's mostly white cast (and somehow Shymalan managed to squeeze in some Indians :-)) is  dead-on because the show was ""American"" is like saying that all Americans are white; blacks, Asians, and other ethnicities/cultures not included.  Worrisome."
-egQ79OrYCs,i agree
-egQ79OrYCs,"This movie is bull! Katara and Sokka aren't that white! Zuko eeeh..he well nah. Aang, they could have done a better job.  The movie might be cool but, the characters kind of suck."
-egQ79OrYCs,Gah. Avatar's too good of a show to be followed up by a bad movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,the fire nation should of been chinese ppls.. lol
-egQ79OrYCs,LMAO xD Zukos scar looks like something lady gaga did herself ROFL
-egQ79OrYCs,u need to look at the show harder cause there aren't any black people in the show at all ever
-egQ79OrYCs,"sorda looks cool, but i think it should of stayed a cartoon"
-egQ79OrYCs,appa?
-egQ79OrYCs,"i couldve sworn that katara,sokka and the tribe were all black. i couldve sworn that all the other people were white. i dont think that ive seen one asian person in that series. i mean think anout it. does aang sound asian to you? does anyone sound asian to you? plus katara and the tribe are black so why do they all sound white. the least they couldve done was make one nigga in the show.the ironic thing is that its created by white and asian people but there;s not one asian person in the show."
-egQ79OrYCs,You saw Zuko? All i saw was Anwar making a 'mean face'
-egQ79OrYCs,reminds me of dragonball z o.0
-egQ79OrYCs,ehh... once you get pass the characters it might end up a good movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,that wut im sayin this was meant for asian people
-egQ79OrYCs,"wrong casting
but still interested"
-egQ79OrYCs,"that movie looks like shit... the seies are great but a ""brown"" zukko with almost no scar?
katara and sokka are freking white, aang looks 8 years old, iroh is like rambo and the only thing i saw that they actually cared about was the special effects... buuu to this movie, hurray to the serie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't know how they plan on fitting the entire Nickelodeon series into one movie. I just don't see it happening, successfully at least..."
-egQ79OrYCs,I really am wondering how thye'll mess this one up. cuz it cant be as good as it looks.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Cool, glad to be a source knowledge.  I still watch the show and I saw a trailer in the theater thinking what garbage"
-egQ79OrYCs,"blecchhhhhh- seirously, youd think the only two dark skinned people in teh actual series wouldn't be the only two light skinned people in teh live action movie..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I feel like this is going to be one of the those movies that has a wack story and little plot, but then people are gonna say ""at least it had cool special effects."""
-egQ79OrYCs,"why you gotta be so hostile, man"
-egQ79OrYCs,@THESUPERCAT64 i use to watch this show all the time on nickelodeon i didnt even no it was anime and now that i no it is i like it more
-egQ79OrYCs,"@SuperDRock15 it will, they should have just made a movie out of the anime because anime you cant compare to real life"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Why are people always so butt hurt when movies are made out of books and series?  I think that this movie could be good if you just relax and watch the movie as its own creation.  Of course it is not going to have the same story content the movies what 2 hours long compared to 18 22 minute episodes.  Quit trolling and enjoy the ride for once, trust me it is a lot more fun."
-egQ79OrYCs,You know what would be amazing?  If this was actually a decent movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,Thank you very much for informing me!! I would have had no idea!!
-egQ79OrYCs,i don't know how they're going to turn a genius animie (give or take) into a movie as spectacular and funny as the show which lasted for 5 seasons (give or take) into a movie with out it being mediocre and dumb.  For the record on the dispute of what culture the movie is: it's none.  The characters are on a differendt planet and it's a mixture of all Asian cultures.
-egQ79OrYCs,"this better be PG-13, and why isnt kitara a hot brown girl with blue eyes?!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Ugh!! I loved that series but this movie looks like its gonna be kinda cheesy!! and do you think that they're going to include the little blind earth bender or zuko becoming a good guy??!
-egQ79OrYCs,aang looks gay...
-egQ79OrYCs,"for f****s sake you don't make a cartoon into 
live-action"
-egQ79OrYCs,he got scared by all the white actors(:!!
-egQ79OrYCs,What happened to the funny outgoing prankster Ang?
-egQ79OrYCs,this is a made up world ..how is it ancient china WTF are u on drugs ..it looks pretty good
-egQ79OrYCs,"I would have done it in 6 movies. Book1: Part1, Book1: Part2, Book 2: Part1, etc etc. that way i could give it justice but lets hope they dont screw it over like dragonball evolution was"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think this  movie might have been 10x's  better if it wasn't  flying under the nickelodeon banner, dont think M. night got much play on the matureity level of this flick :/     hopefuly the young actors will be believable, to warrant the price of a ticket        ._.;"
-egQ79OrYCs,"great timing for this movie from a marketing perspective, since it was right after the multibillion dollar grossing movie with the same name, avatar"
-egQ79OrYCs,why did they make the avatar look so dark? and evil in a way?
-egQ79OrYCs,I think it would be really difficult to make The Last Airbender bad no matter who directs it. . . So long as they don't try to cram every part of the series into one movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"Nice childmovie, gonan suck tho :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,why make a movie about this and not half life
-egQ79OrYCs,why the freak is zuko middle eastern? he's suppose tobe a cool asian
-egQ79OrYCs,Your Mom??????????
-egQ79OrYCs,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was an awesome movie. The hell you talking about?
-egQ79OrYCs,Dude WTF why arnt katara and saka asian? arnt they asian?
-egQ79OrYCs,ok whoever said there are no asians in the cartoon............what cartoon have you been watching? ALL of aangs people are chinese. please get your facts right.

-egQ79OrYCs,i so gotta see this movie:)
-egQ79OrYCs,oh my god really?! :D
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope this movie doesn't suck because when hollywood tries to make movies out of tv shows' it usually sucks
-egQ79OrYCs,hm.....Needs more asian
-egQ79OrYCs,"Actually that's what they're planning to do. The studio wants this movie series to be the ""next"" Harry Potter. =D"
-egQ79OrYCs,@raychamp01 wheres appa and mommo?
-egQ79OrYCs,"You all say she is ugly, yet you all probably have alot of pimples and deformed nose."
-egQ79OrYCs,The hard part is the fact that they are all kids. Which makes the acting um...well...you know
-egQ79OrYCs,wers apa and momo at
-egQ79OrYCs,"They were aliens all along
WHAT A TWIST"
-egQ79OrYCs,the tattoes on his back look different
-egQ79OrYCs,this is going to be so cool lol [=
-egQ79OrYCs,"W
T
F
none of the characters look like thier supposed to except aang a little Zuko issnt indian hes asian same goes for Katara and the rest of these white people and Katara ia supposed to hot this white chick isnt hot at all she was supposed to be like drop dead gorgeous"
-egQ79OrYCs,Could be really good or really bad. I'm a fan so I'm hoping for the first.
-egQ79OrYCs,The Twist is that the trees are actually killing the airbender
-egQ79OrYCs,"This has 4 possible ways to turn out either it will SUCK MAJOR DICK, suck really bad but not worse then Dragonball Evolution, be just meh not bad or amazing."
-egQ79OrYCs,"as long as they dont do the same thing they did to poor Goku(I feel sorry for Akira), Im fine with this."
-egQ79OrYCs,"so...who cares what color they are as long as the movie sticks to the storyline...no matter how you put it,it sounds racist."
-egQ79OrYCs,slumdog millonaire looks like find his fortune 2nd time
-egQ79OrYCs,holy shit this is gonna be DA BEST MOVIE
-egQ79OrYCs,"the actor should of been frekin Asian.

the only reason that they're white actors is to please the white population.

DAMMM WHITE supremacy"
-egQ79OrYCs,HEY HEY! Lets not judge it till later. I've been doubting this ever since I heard and researched it. I'm only 25% it might be good but in the likely event that it DOES sux I'm gonna bash Shyamalan's head in.
-egQ79OrYCs,you do no research do you? Just google air bender trilogy and youll see you're wrong. lol
-egQ79OrYCs,wow this is soo stupid why'd they have to go and make half the cast white?
-egQ79OrYCs,aang should have been more asian. and i hate the tatoo. i just want plain arrows. soka shoulda been 100% asian aswell.ugh. the characters make it......okward for me....i pictured aang as a little shoulin kungfu kid. no offense any one!
-egQ79OrYCs,they were pretty much white in the show too. Fail.
-egQ79OrYCs,@JacobCMay exactly WTF they coulda made this way better
-egQ79OrYCs,{:{please click on my channel  to see me make some hot beats}:} TAKE CARE BRUSH YOUR HAIR
-egQ79OrYCs,same
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow this sucks lol, lame effects ang looks fat lol, and the other 2 idiots r white all of a sudden.
watched the show from time to time. not gonna watch this CRAP :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,lol
-egQ79OrYCs,katara could look better but sokka is right on
-egQ79OrYCs,sweet
-egQ79OrYCs,the actors look too young
-egQ79OrYCs,is appa and momo in the movie?
-egQ79OrYCs,even my boner has a boner!
-egQ79OrYCs,"It looks like they're trying to cram the entire series into one film. BIG mistake. They coulda' had a nice trilogy and made tons more money. I think Sokka and Katara look PERFECT , though. They aren't black, they're Eskimos or something like that. It shouldn't be an issue, though."
-egQ79OrYCs,was a good cartoon... not sure about this
-egQ79OrYCs,hun..thought sokka was black...
-egQ79OrYCs,He is way too little.
-egQ79OrYCs,how old is the avatar? like ten or something
-egQ79OrYCs,that looks raw
-egQ79OrYCs,"Thats funny, because they all dont look asian.  That would imply that, the entire earth in that world, is Asian.   Some look asian, some dont.  Cabbage man guy, looks asian, Aang, doesn't.  Definetly based on such beliefs and philosphies as the asian culture, but the characters in the cartoon are as diverse looking as can be.  And its a cartoon so they are drawn in cartoon fashion."
-egQ79OrYCs,what should they look like? Straight up blue arrows? Dont think that would look too great on real film as in cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,"r u deaf? she clearly said ""we all need him"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"they are in it.  Atleast forsure appa is.  if you watch the superbowl promo trailer, you can see appa in the background when aang is watching the battle with the firenation."
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko is Asian. not Caucasian. Almost everyone in the serious is Asian.
-egQ79OrYCs,"no. its based of a show called ""avatar...the last airbender"" not to be confused with the recent movie called ""avatar"" . check out the cartoon on utube or google. Its really great!"
-egQ79OrYCs,the only think that might save this is the fact that the writers of the cartoon have control over the story for the movie. and its going to be a trillogy
-egQ79OrYCs,"i hate him too...


but he would have been a better zuko then that indian guy..."
-egQ79OrYCs,checkout ONE BAD MICE TRAILER
-egQ79OrYCs,where is appa??? and momo?? :S
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't know... because he's a child in a war? You know, that can be pretty upsetting. Now, speaking more seriously, I hope Aang have his happy go lucky attitude, he needs it-"
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is ridiculous. They would never cast an asian person for a role conceived for a caucasion person yet for roles which really should be performed by an all asian cast, they will cast anyone. I liked this show bcoz it paralleled some events that have occured in, and still occur in China and Tibet, but now theyve completly westernised, not just with casting, but clearly with writting and vission as well. This was 1 of the few things which was inspired by oriental culture and history til now"
-egQ79OrYCs,Bald is the new sexy
-egQ79OrYCs,avatar the air bender huh
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah i do hope aang will be more....... happy-looking. i mean, i know that this is gonna be MUCH different & more serious than the series, but still"
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks like this is goin to be all da way to da battle in the north water tribe, cuz i see sokka nd that girl turning in to the moon spirit"
-egQ79OrYCs,@nekworld it just shows drama and character. Im sure ur hopes will come true!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"why is Aang so angry and sad through out the trailer... -_-
he supposed to be optimistic one, i hope he smiles more in the movie..."
-egQ79OrYCs,@Goatmon So your saying all white people have to be white as snow? Just kidding you douchebag.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Potterfan89 its most likely a trilogy, not one movie. look at the trailer, only ice n ice n ice, book 1: water. also someone told me that they were sure they saw a trilogy contract of some sort aswell."
-egQ79OrYCs,i just love the avatar state
-egQ79OrYCs,"And I think I'm just going to stop bothering to argue this.  

This argument is like having to explain math to a sandwich.

A sandwich with downs syndrome."
-egQ79OrYCs,"No they don't?

They are clearly dakrer skinned than most other characters, especially compared toAang and Toph.  Their hairstyles and facial features also have a few features that are distinctively not white.  

You have to be pretty ignorant of facial and color differences to think Katara and Sokka were white people in the series. :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,I AM DYINGGGGGGGGGGGGG 2 SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i saw the trailer like a hundred times lol.i just hope that it would come out a little shorter cuz i wanna c it b4 school is out.
-egQ79OrYCs,woo cant wait
-egQ79OrYCs,How are they going to make an entire series into one movie?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Goatmon 
If you would watch the series, you would see that the brother and sister look white. so theres not much of a difference"
-egQ79OrYCs,Pussy.
-egQ79OrYCs,I give a crap because I dislike a culture of eskimo/native american based characters being represented by white people.  :P
-egQ79OrYCs,Is that Katara the girl from Narnia? I expected her to be taller and prettier. But still didn't show up Sokka?
-egQ79OrYCs,"OMG!!!!
i have to see this movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Hopefully this will end up being more ""Star Trek"" than ""GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" in terms of success, quality, and chance of future entries."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Are you deaf? she says ""and we all need him"""
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think she says ""we all need him"", aint sure lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Mae, and Ti Lee aren't in this because they weren't in the first season, this is based on the first season of Avatar. Azula may make in an appearance since she did show up in the last 30 seconds of the first season. Appa, Momo, and Suki are in this movie, and in the superbowl tv spot, Appa made an appearance."
-egQ79OrYCs,nah she said we all need him not wont
-egQ79OrYCs,"ur rite too, once the characters are down packed im good, i think the actors will do the show justice, the voices sound on point so far based on the trailer, Katara sounds like Katara, Iroh sounds like Iroh, even Sokka's grandmother narrating the story is on point"
-egQ79OrYCs,"you must have failed real badly during those 6 years then, because I know for a fact it was M. Night Shyamalan's idea to do this movie, after he stated himself, in an interview. Nice one assbag."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I can't wait the best part of book one in terms of waterbending was Katara vs Master Pakku, that better be in this movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,umm yea they had to change the clothing because those cartoon colors wouldn't look good in real life it would look like a joke. y do u think wolverine wasnt wearing yellow spandexs in the movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"This looks amazing, I can't wait till it comes out."
-egQ79OrYCs,well of course he doesnt look like a playful boy cuzz he is fighting and meditating  the trailer
-egQ79OrYCs,The people that wrote the show also helped write the movie. I don't think it'll be so horrible. D:
-egQ79OrYCs,"In this trailer, it looks like they kept pretty close to the show. Except I don't see Apa or Momo. :("
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks much better than dragonball the movie. iÂ´ll watch it ;)
-egQ79OrYCs,"i don't care how sweet it looks, they better not bastardize one of my favorite shows..."
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks fuckin amazing. Hopeully this turns out to be as good as the trailer
-egQ79OrYCs,"what do you mean 'they' should have let Peter Jackson do this movie.  Do you have any idea how movie production works? Usually, directors go to film production companies with their ideas, as in the case of this movie, and not the other way round as youre suggesting tardballs."
-egQ79OrYCs,"sorry :P cant find their comment, what did it say?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@cindyluloo 

Not to start no mess, but look a bit closer at the show and you'd see characters with green eyes even in the Fire Nation. The main characters completely fit into those descriptions, but that isn't indicative of everyone in the nations they were from.

It'd be like saying everyone in America is mixed based on Obama.

Don't forget about the black guy with the chains who was in the Rough Rhinos."
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf do shaolin monks have to do with this movie at all?
-egQ79OrYCs,"no, you're right. im fairly sure theyre signed for a trilogy, i watched an interview with m. knight shyamalan and he said something like that."
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow, your actually going to argue over colors?  Our society should be so far past this point its ridiculous.  

Kindergartener 1:  ""Its violet!""
Kindergartener 2:  ""No!  Its purple!""   

Seriously who gives a crap."
-egQ79OrYCs,appa and momo are in the film are they not?
-egQ79OrYCs,"cant wait for this movie, doubt it will be as good as the anime, but it defenately looks good to watch. Also, notice all this in the trailer happens ONLY DURING BOOK 1: WATER, yes i am saying that its quite possible that there will be 3 films. :) prolly not new, but well, thought i'd say it"
-egQ79OrYCs,Where was Appa and Momo ??
-egQ79OrYCs,"You... you're joking, right?   You're not seriously suggesting that eskimos are white people, are you? 

Because they're not."
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh man. If they have Momo and appa that would be so cool. The trailor fits with what I remember of the show.. So Excited!!! Can not wait till it comes out..
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope that it doesn't lose the lighthearted moments it had in the cartoon.
-egQ79OrYCs,if tat kid is asian i felt it is much better LOL
-egQ79OrYCs,.........???
-egQ79OrYCs,r any of yall sure yall r avatar fans???? cuz if u were u would know azula and toph dont show up til the 2nd season. so duh there will be a 2nd movie. cant fit 3 season in one whole movie.  and duh momo and appa will be in it. man and some of yall call yourselves fans. go watch nicktoons if u r out of date with ur avatar lol
-egQ79OrYCs,Holy SHIT... that looks AWESOME!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,it showed it in this video lol
-egQ79OrYCs,i wanna see azula and toph are they not in it?
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah baby.. AVATAR state looks f**king awesome! Can't wait to see the real Avatar!...

But where is appa??"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@jaynkay100 I think Appa is in the movie.  I know Shyamalon wanted to remove the lighthearted moments from the series, but that doesn't change that one guy who saw the test screening said that the characters of Zhao and Sokka are grossly overacted.  So, I wonder if the actors are just bad or if they tried to stick some lame moments in the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I've heard rumors that Appa and momo were taken out of the movie version, and apparently so were any sense of humor and lightheartedness."
-egQ79OrYCs,"ok sokka and katara are inuits, not white. and zuko's supposed to be chinese, not indian. its all messed up... and where the hell is toph? she's my favorite... is there gonna be a 2nd movie?"
-egQ79OrYCs,ZUKO NOT UGLY ENOUGH.
-egQ79OrYCs,They are supposed to be.  The Water tribe are eskimo like.  They look correct.  Remember Avatar is based on the entire world.  The asian people are the Airbenders and maybe the fire benders (maybe).  A lot of the others are many different races.
-egQ79OrYCs,wonder what he looks like in avatar state
-egQ79OrYCs,*sigh* because Avatar is a mesh of many different races.  It consist of people all over the entire world.  For example the water tribe is meant to look more like eskimos.
-egQ79OrYCs,Awesome! I'm so excited for this movie! I own the entire cartoon series and it's more than just a tv show - it has a lot of good lessons and Buddhist & Asian philosophy.
-egQ79OrYCs,@chemsprite1 Who cares about asians? Where are the inuits?
-egQ79OrYCs,"If they put all three books on this movie, I'm gonna walk outta the theater by screaming FUCK THIS SHIT!!! as loudly as possible the second i see content that shouldn't be coming"
-egQ79OrYCs,"it looks that way, from the trailer it looks like theyre only covering chapter one, water. looks good though"
-egQ79OrYCs,pfail movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"Couldn't find Asian people or Eskimos to be in the movie M.?? I hope you don't try to fit all 3 books in one movie cause that will end in fail, please don't further the destruction of my childhood. I hope that this turns out to be good."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Damn. I have to say this looks pretty freaking good! The acting doesnt look bad, the special effects look stunning and it seems to follow the show pretty well. I guess thats what you get when you get a hardcore fan directing it xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,i like the cartoon more :)
-egQ79OrYCs,wow can wat to see it butt the people look wearied as in sokka lolz
-egQ79OrYCs,ho..ly.. shet ._.
-egQ79OrYCs,As long as it isn't as bad as dragonball was I'll be happy.
-egQ79OrYCs,Im calling BS on this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,maybe you missed the part in the show where aang is a little kid......oh wait he was a little kid the entire show.
-egQ79OrYCs,aang is a kid!! he's only 12!
-egQ79OrYCs,lol wired!
-egQ79OrYCs,I swear this was a manga. this is gonna be shit. like eragon. ruined the original
-egQ79OrYCs,The tattoos on Aang are epic win. I shall steal them. Steal them with my mind!
-egQ79OrYCs,i dunno they seem alright for me it's the tatoo's new design that is odd for me.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah, definitely agree. I really wish they had choosen someone else for Ang and Katara."
-egQ79OrYCs,does anyone know the soundtrack in the middle
-egQ79OrYCs,"@macbledsoe 
So true"
-egQ79OrYCs,LMFAO!
-egQ79OrYCs,If you actually had the time to know the story you wouldn't be typing your ignorant nonsense.
-egQ79OrYCs,"original story = american writers, american compnay, american voice actors . . . its an american cartoon. Hence, this is an american movie with american actors. its not bad, just staying true to the original."
-egQ79OrYCs,I am going to be so mad if M. Night ruins this movie. The TV Show was amazing and so is the story line. If he messes them both up with crappy graphics and acting then I will never watch another one of his movies.
-egQ79OrYCs,@blake3062. That's the point. This live-action adaptation was meant to dispense of some cartoonish antics (like keeping Sokka and Aang tamed). According to original creators Michael and Bryan as well as director Shyamalan.
-egQ79OrYCs,And that is coming from someone who fails in life.
-egQ79OrYCs,I agree 100%.
-egQ79OrYCs,@ shafafullah I'm pretty sure he does.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well Aang is only like, 10 or something in the show. So he is SUPPOSED to be really young."
-egQ79OrYCs,Its worth a try ^^
-egQ79OrYCs,and i havent seen appa in any of the trailers wuts up with that u cant have aang without appa
-egQ79OrYCs,i cant wait for this movie to come out i love avatar (yes i said it lol its what the name should've been) i just really hope this movie far surpasses shamalans other movies which SUCKED!!!! pleas e just please dont let him screw this movie up
-egQ79OrYCs,"awesome, only problem is aang looks really young :S"
-egQ79OrYCs,gotta see that
-egQ79OrYCs,"this trailer is amazing, looks like shyamalan knows what he is doin!
Avatar is a cartoon with great story"
-egQ79OrYCs,@SonicSoulCipher hell yeah it does...XD
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie looks better than I had feared.
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks awesome but why does Aang look like his 8 years old shouldn't he be like 13 or something?
-egQ79OrYCs,"They needed ALOT of rope to make all of those people swing away, lol."
-egQ79OrYCs,So fucking AWESOME !  I saw all the episodes ! Love it !
-egQ79OrYCs,@Yangsen I wouldnt really call it an anime. Its like americanime. trust me you wouldnt wanna see that cartoon. But the movie looks pretty sweet
-egQ79OrYCs,I am so excited!
-egQ79OrYCs,Does anyone know the name of the song?
-egQ79OrYCs,ANG is not FAT what the fuck is shylaman thinking? getting this bullshit cast
-egQ79OrYCs,"this looks like a really good adaption of Avatar. so what if none of the actors are Asian? in the cartoon, no character even looks close to being Asian but most have Asian names *shrug* that's pretty much what happens in real anime, too. Avatar was produced by an American cartoonist, so whether the characters are Asian or not doesn't matter. Dragonball is a different story. how do they explain why an American teen somehow was named Goku and had a Japanese grandfather? that's just stupidity."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think the trailer is good, but I;m a little bit dissapointed about the cast. In my imagination Prince Zuko, Katara, Sokka, and Aang are Asian. Every movie which based on series or books will have some weaknesses. so, I think,  it doesn't matter ."
-egQ79OrYCs,Well that is true but it is anime but it's called American anime and the cartoon is based on asain culture as well. I mean you can tell. I don't care much if the cast isn't an asian cast as long as they get the characteristics down and personalities of the characters right I'm cool with it.
-egQ79OrYCs,THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"i don't understand y everyone thinks the characters are supposed to be or look asian, noone in the cartoon looks asian and as a matter of fact it's not even an anime or based on anything asian at all, the show was created by a white guy, yea, there are some asian influences in the show, like the fighting and the writing but tht doesn't mean anything, it's called doing research and even the greatest movies based on books and tv series have inaccuracies, it's inevitable"
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:07
That slumdog kid cant keep his mouth shut?
His mouth is always hanging open"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think this will take place during an attack on the water tribe, not the entire series. then maybe he'll compress the other episodes into two more movies. this is just an assumption"
-egQ79OrYCs,lol...if u see the cartoon u'll know....katara and saka are both black...aang is yellow....even the names are not americans......u get it?and buddhism is not from america....especially aang...they suppose to take some kid from india...instead of white kids....i'm not racist but this vid's so on it....what's wrong if they stick to the story.....?get it?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Man, appa was put in the background and only visible for a split second. I wouldn't of been tell that it was him/her unless I had actually watched the series and used some imagination because they made him blend in way too much with the snow."
-egQ79OrYCs,"What the fuck are you talking about!?!? In asian cultures they still worship the elements it's and ancient form of Buhddism, Taoism, and Shinto: Which  is charcterized in worshipping nature and the Elements. This was formed during the Shang-Zhou era or Zhou era. Of course their's no Kanji in it it's made by fucking Americans!! You're consumed by spouting so boldy about shit you don't know about!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@hamkaring87 
This was created by americans...wasn't it?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yah, I know. One would assume that when your dad tries to burn your face off, that the scar left behind would be more visible, because your dad is suppose to be able to go toe and toe with the avatar in his avatar form."
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf did they drop acid while they were casting this movie?
-egQ79OrYCs,the actors look so wrong..why doesnt zuko have hes burn mark last time i checked iro was fat with grey hair
-egQ79OrYCs,Anyone knows the name of the song ?
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol, I have to use your linked time stamp to even see the scar clearly, you miss it when normally viewing because the scar is barely visible for a split second."
-egQ79OrYCs,"yeah...they ruined all of asians cartoons and anime...like dragon ball z,street fighter,tekken coming up,and now this...gr8....just what we need is a lame wannabe asians......"
-egQ79OrYCs,ahahhhhah
-egQ79OrYCs,Don't worry about what that LOSER had to say to you I told him off for you. I hate when ppl think they know stuff and they don't.
-egQ79OrYCs,SO EXCITED.
-egQ79OrYCs,"people tend to knee-jerk about this kind of stuff. just take a second and lay things out in your head, do alittle research aside from what you only see in the trailer. there is alot of info on this movie out there, just gotta look. like the badass picture of aang facing down 20+ fire-nation soldiers alone. or better pics of zukos scar, or more people of earth/fire/water nations, so you can see how it all works out."
-egQ79OrYCs,FAIL ACTORS !
-egQ79OrYCs,eeeee Jackson Rathbone :D
-egQ79OrYCs,dont fuck with zuko. he's really good at who wants to be a millionaire.
-egQ79OrYCs,"damn, i can't wait till this comes out"
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow!!this movie is going to be Sucks!!!!!
it's not the same like the animate one..
and aang is to small in this movie..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Another one of these superpower movies.

Yawn, hollywood really needs to step it up."
-egQ79OrYCs,This is so lame
-egQ79OrYCs,FAIL actors
-egQ79OrYCs,"you can also see the scar alot better in some of the pics that have been released. for some reason it just really doesnt show up here. its not as drastic as the cartoons, but it does look like a bad burn that has healed over as it would IRL."
-egQ79OrYCs,"appa is in, if you watch the superbowl trailer, you can see him in the background (top left) in the quick little battle scene.

momo is in too"
-egQ79OrYCs,"at 1:04, the left eye u can see the scar."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@danceswithvv0lves Also, where is Appa, Aang's giant flying bison who serves as the group's main form of transportation around the world. He was stuck in suspended animation with Aang for 100 years, and supposedly shares a very strong bond with him, but we haven't seen him in the trailers at all. According to Aang, flying bison were the first Airbenders, so if there no Appa in the story how did Aang and the rest of airbenders learn how to airbend?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ok, uhm where is zuko's huge ""Half of my face got burnt off by my daddy"" scar at?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Nickelodeon Films turning one of their most successfull and story driven Nicktoons into a live action movie is somehow the same as ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" being rip offs of Japanese Horror Movies?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Can't wait to watch em!
-egQ79OrYCs,"AMAZING!
Only Zuko's scarf looks not as bad as in the cartoon."
-egQ79OrYCs,Can't wait to see him turn into that giant ass water spirit!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is about Avatar Season 1. Toph started out in Season 2.

Watch this movie so it'll be popular enough for them to make a sequal (That will be about Season 2). And she'll be in that."
-egQ79OrYCs,He always looks funny
-egQ79OrYCs,i donÂ´t like it they should let it as a cartoon not make this shit i mean it was pretty cool as a cartoon and funny but it isnt made for a big movie -.- and how the fuck are they wanne but the hole story without ruin the characters or some other thing like in eragon the book is awesome but the movie the biggest crab if seen in the last years >:- (
-egQ79OrYCs,"He's not a Shaolin Monk, he's a monk from the Air Nomads."
-egQ79OrYCs,That movie's gonna be awesome! Jackson Rathbone as Sokka- this should be interesting :) Can't wait :)
-egQ79OrYCs,Can't believe I have to wait until July to see it!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Oh look, an idiot making a comment while he has probably never seen the animation."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Um that's what I was saying to begin with pay attention to what I said. American developers inspired by anime, which helps with the asian culture influences they use in the show. I know a lot about culture actually so lay off.  All I pointed out (other than the show was created by American's who had inspiration from another culture) was the fact that a lot of Japanese anime are heavily influenced by American culture. Don't hate Americans for having influence when the culture does the same thing."
-egQ79OrYCs,zuzu
-egQ79OrYCs,does any one what role is DEV PATEL playing in this movie?
-egQ79OrYCs,"btw....

where the hell is appa !!!???!?

lol :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,in cartoon avatar was funny.. here he looks scary!
-egQ79OrYCs,I have to say that this movie looks....ok. I still prefer the animated series though.
-egQ79OrYCs,"jackson rathbone is good looking,i know but is he funny as sokka?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Looks good to me, even though it feels a bit more serious than a cartoon. I am kind of surprised Shyamalan is doing this, I thought he only makes horrors and stuff."
-egQ79OrYCs,"the actors suck ass
zuko looks gay"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@godricmudblood Avatar isn't an Anime, mudblood."
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think this is only based on book 1

then there will be Last airbender 2 and 3 

lol :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,film is too dark...also i think  they'll lost that awesome kind of humor in the anime..
-egQ79OrYCs,one huge cartoon and everybody is making a big fuss? america ruined every single anime that got into their hands. remember dragon ball? naruto?
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DMCMaster550 

Don't gimme that...the cartoon is influenced by Asian culture and you know it.  Oh, wait a minute...how much do you really know about culture to begin with?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Where is the flying platypus?!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hope this become a good movie. i thought the animated ""last airbender"" was great, one of the best iand i would be reallydisatointed if this one is not like the animated one"
-egQ79OrYCs,hmm i was hopeing it would be more like the anime but its going going to be :( but the movie looks cool even if you havnt seen the anime BUT WHY IS ZUKO UGLY ZUKOS SO HOT IN THE ANIME :(
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HaloedG 
You made a good point about the culture thing but made yourself sound like an idiot my saying Shyamalan secretly wishes we was white, that's kinda immature. And anyway the damn show was created by Americans who were inspired by anime, so this movie isn't stealing anything from culture. The show didn't steal culture either it just used it as inspiration. That's like saying Japanese animes (which are mostly American influenced) such as Cowboy Bebop steal our culture."
-egQ79OrYCs,"aww! zuko doesnt look like zuko!
and they change some parts when katara and soka found aang!
cant wait to see this though!
its going to be HUGE!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope everyone who's saying Shyamalan is stealing another cultures work realizes the show Avatar was created by American Developers who were inspired by anime. I will agree America has run out of ideas but the show is American.
-egQ79OrYCs,looks cool
-egQ79OrYCs,"wtf is with the slow mo shit and weird air effect.

Fail man :( No one wants to watch some asian kid blowing wind around."
-egQ79OrYCs,funny how no one mentioned avatar in this trailer oh and........WHERE THE HELL IS ZUKO'S BURN MARK?
-egQ79OrYCs,"In the other trailer you can see Appa's tail, he'll be in there so I assume Momo will be as well xD"
-egQ79OrYCs,In the other trailer you can just BARELY see Appa's tail in the corner haha! :)
-egQ79OrYCs,ohh that is so cool!! my best friend's mom is in the movie too! she plays like the nurse for the prince and princess.. haha. this looks reallyyy good tho!! :)
-egQ79OrYCs,too bad that d title AVATAR was taken by blue smurfs
-egQ79OrYCs,"It's very much based on martial arts. Firebending is Shaolin Kung Fu, Waterbending is Tai Chi, Earthbending is Hung Gar, and Airbending is Ba gua. All the moves are based on martial arts. My friend is in the movie (seychelle gabriel as princess yue-1:22) and she said everyone was learning martial arts, and how they relate to the show. OH! if you look in the superbowl trailer you can kinda see Appa mid way in the upper left hand corner my friend showed me :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Another example of Hollywood stealing culture away and white washing it...only this time, its from another Asian guy...only not really, if you count that he's Indian and probably has self esteem issues, hates his own color, and secretly wishes he were white."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@StarsAndSheeps 

Just for the record...are you white?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Shyamalan is just like that clown who made DBZ, another sellout Asian who would rather make a movie to cater to whites and make a quick buck than make an accurate portrayal that fills a much needed lack of Asians in cinema.  There could have been tons of breakthru performances for Asian and Asian American actors with this movie, but no, it just goes to show what a mark that clown is.  I hope people boycott this, because I know I will.

Fuck Hollywood."
-egQ79OrYCs,WHERES OPPA AND MOMO????????
-egQ79OrYCs,The casting is horridly off.... they're all meant to be Asian! either that or Shyamalan is just xenophobic or racist... we will never know.
-egQ79OrYCs,gave me chills the movie better be as good as the trailer and not like the gay dbz movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"NICE!!!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD!!! for those of you who are haters and are trying to find every possible reason not to go see the movie do us a favor and stop talking you are wasting our time and air. If you don't like then don't watch it... its that simple, problem solved."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@orcbreath u read my mind
the trailer sure looks awesoomeeeeeee due"
-egQ79OrYCs,"and btw, where's oppa and momo?? it wont work without them."
-egQ79OrYCs,"just hope that Sokka would really be as pretty freaking darned funny as he is in the animation on. Zuko should be at least a bit more attractive.. he's so hot in the animation. T^T I hope it'll work.. ouh please work! I'm a die hard fan of the animation one... PLEASE WORK!!!

again.. I wish Zuko could a bit more handsome.."
-egQ79OrYCs,they didn't use 'Avatar' for the title so it would not be the same as from the other movie by James Cameron that came out last december
-egQ79OrYCs,"Zuko's Scar is like almost nonexistent D:

Also, Jackson Rathbone as Sokka looks okay, but he doesn't seem like he'll be goofy and Sokka-ish to me. Hmm."
-egQ79OrYCs,"why do i have the feeling thats its gonna fail really??!!
and ang's actor looks to young??"
-egQ79OrYCs,deym! this looks awesome. the first trailer psyched me up. this just makes me wanna see the movie right now. :))
-egQ79OrYCs,"@whazeem I agree with you. I'm not going in to see this movie with much expectation. So if it does turn out to be bad then I won't be too disappointed.

And yes. That's exactly why they didn't include ""Avatar"" in the title."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@livingtonu The creators of Avatar did set the story in an Asian influenced world. And not religion, but some Chinese martial arts do have teachings about the elements."
-egQ79OrYCs,americans are often the good guys while asians and arabs like me are often the bad guys! america is satan! Allah akbar!! we will boycott this movie!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,@novanthien Book 1 Water
-egQ79OrYCs,another film already owned that title ^^
-egQ79OrYCs,where and when cuz i couldn't see him ...post the time you saw appa
-egQ79OrYCs,"And eff the casting directors! The only person of color in the movie is casted in ""the bad guy role"". Ooooh ponder that matha fackkkkass! DON'T GET OUR HERITAGE TWISTED! Fuck the whole ""ohh their actors! their suppose to be acting!"" eff that nonsense! seriously."
-egQ79OrYCs,2010 is a year filled with good movies
-egQ79OrYCs,"It's important that people of color are represented accurately this is just fucked up to me. YES it is racist! Not the overt kind where someone's all like ""I HATE BLACK FOLKS!!"" but of all the asian kids who know karate in the world yall gotta cast a fucking white boy? That's bullshit. I love Avatar but I'm boycotting this movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I really do hate commenting to all the negative feedback and whack comments on youtube and who the eff is gonna read my comment? But Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my all time favorite shows! I really love it!! But let's face it where did the creators draw inspiration from? What culture, people and heritage?"
-egQ79OrYCs,cool
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko is the guy from slumdog millionaire. And doesn't his hair need to be a bit longer?
-egQ79OrYCs,"so nice...
but.. katara should be black..

why shes ""you know na?"""
-egQ79OrYCs,THE WATER TRIBE:  Lookit all the white people!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Neither did the Lord of the Rings movies, (1st and 2nd) Yet they still were rated really high."
-egQ79OrYCs,wow cant wait to watch this
-egQ79OrYCs,i seen that cartoon its not the best but this preview looks awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,"the trailer was good and this makes the movie exciting and to watch out for,,,

great job..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Maybe because thats only all they showed? It has to look appealing in a small amount of editted footage.

They cant show much characterization in a trailer, unfortunately."
-egQ79OrYCs,I think that's the moon princess chick. Y'no? The one that gets turned into the moon or whatever. :P
-egQ79OrYCs,And Momo... You can't forget Momo. :) I agree though! The unfortunate thing with this movie is that the show was really humorous and had all these silly gags... This is just TOO epic for it's own good. :( Sad day. I hope it's good but I have a feeling it will be filled with crappy acting and a weak plot.
-egQ79OrYCs,this is so great!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm guessing if this movie does well, it will end up as a sequel being (Season 2) of the Avatar Series. Since this movie looks like the story line of Season 1 in the series. I just hope it won't end up really bad or else it will kill the animated T.V. series even though its done. For example the Dragon Ball Z movie :( Well hope this will be good."
-egQ79OrYCs,love itttttttttttttttttttttt
-egQ79OrYCs,One of the most epic movie trailer EVER! Can't wait to see The Last Airbender!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I REALLY like the show and all...But it's sad to say, I think this is going to bomb ):
They should've stuck to making more episodes, or some kind movie for the after math of the whole story...But meh.
I hope the movie at least stays on the same path of the movie unlike some Animation to live transactions...Example, Dragonball. UGH, what a fail. At least we have a better director...Right?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@1986supernova 
There is no one that has lived or will ever live that will be as awesome as Makoto for the Uncle Iroh role."
-egQ79OrYCs,cool but won't live up to the anime
-egQ79OrYCs,"@H1d3k1Ryuga
  I see ( ^ - ^ )... tnx.
 (Practically, they can't really put the entire story in just 2-3 hour movie.) 
Too Bad... But still i need to see this."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm pretty sure Toph isn't going to be in this movie. They're holding out for sequel(s). Yeah, I'm pissed too."
-egQ79OrYCs,Give the man a chance this is his make it or break it film.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@cocacolafresh

No, it's not in China. It's an imaginary world."
-egQ79OrYCs,It is it's own world.  The entire world is at war and it consists of 4 nations. (It is based off of Chinese Kung Fu however)  The water tribe is meant to be eskimo like etc.)
-egQ79OrYCs,"So excited to watch this movie.
The ones whose playing the role of  Aang and Sokka looks really cute. And Im a huge fan of Prince Zuko. 

I haven't seen Toph in the trailer yet.
(Have watch all the episodes already...)

Can't wait to see this movie. ( ^ - ^ )"
-egQ79OrYCs,WHERE'S TOPH!?!?!?! WTF!?!?!??!
-egQ79OrYCs,whys everyone white. isnt this in china?
-egQ79OrYCs,dam dis shit looks hot.. must see
-egQ79OrYCs,Better not ruin the cabbage guy!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,AVATAR: The Last Airbender.
-egQ79OrYCs,"That's a bit disappointing to hear. 
But, at the same time I'm glad to hear they're not going to try and stuff everything into two hours."
-egQ79OrYCs,"They're probably just making him look more serious for the trailer, to try and hook a wider audience. Who knows? Besides Aang can get pretty scary sometimes. 
Also that's definitely an Earth Bender at 1:17. And they appear to be wearing an outfit very similar to Toph's. But they appear to be male and a bit too old.
Anyways, Toph rocks! (no pun intended... yes there was) so I really hope she's in it."
-egQ79OrYCs,@BarneysanchezDH Toph is in earth and this film is going to be only water.
-egQ79OrYCs,Im a huge Zuko fan because he looked and acted badass. Dev Patel isnt cuttin it for me here. I hope he doesn't kill it for me.
-egQ79OrYCs,I CANT WAIT!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"it was a bad ass show, this should be a bad ass movie

hopeful for good acting haha"
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks like a movie that plays on the scifi channel. cant wait to watch it though...i watched all the episodes. ^^
-egQ79OrYCs,@NarutoFireFox84 thank you
-egQ79OrYCs,"Damn he looks badass but not funny like in the cartoon, and wheres toph"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i dont get it wich is the first ""book"" tell me pleas because i want to see from th 1 to the last episode but dont know how to start to look for them"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i dont agree with the casting 100%... but im still lightweight excited.. im just not expecting it to blow my mind, but i want it to be a good and entertaining movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"This may seem random, but I REALLY hope they put in the Blue Spirit storyline!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Hey i thought McCartney was Zuko!
-egQ79OrYCs,I wonder what Appa is going to look like
-egQ79OrYCs,"As long as Suki remains and Jasper doesn't eff up Sokka, we're good.  Katara didn't seem to show that strength she has in the anime though.  But, it's just a trailer.  I have faith in this.  The director doesn't make crap."
-egQ79OrYCs,-9 LOL you fail @ life.
-egQ79OrYCs,"This looks beautiful and quite well done. Adapting an animated feature into a live action is never easy but I do believe this will top it off.

And as for the popular topic of race honestly its a fictional world, they could be whatever they want to be."
-egQ79OrYCs,well 'Avatar The Last Airbender' is an American series (google it) influenced by Chinese martial arts .... hence the movie has a white kid doing martial arts ....
-egQ79OrYCs,He's chinese
-egQ79OrYCs,That was a reading workout.
-egQ79OrYCs,Shut up about the race thing. This looks so good!
-egQ79OrYCs,Nice to see how many people completely missed the point of the series itself and turned this into a race riot or some crap. The four nations in the series were unique in and of themselves with SOME influences of cultures in the real world. Seriously. Watch the show again and look at what all the characters actually look like.
-egQ79OrYCs,"this is racist, a white kid trying to be a shaolin monk!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i didnt liked the cast at all. but now i look at the trailer, they do resembel all the characters. though, Iroh has little laid back characteristic. The actor doesnt have that kind of look... dunno... will see. but seriously, the trailer is well done. Lets hope the movie is just as good. looking forward to see this movie! :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"first, u jus insinuated im stupid n tht is fuckin disrespectful cuz u dnt noe me, n if u dnt lyk the way i spell den dnt read it, n im actually a vry gud speller for ur info. cuz im in no english classes cuz i alrdy passed all of dem wit an A. so jus get a lyf n stop bein fuckin disrespectful."
-egQ79OrYCs,I like that music.  Its kinda like the cartoon but it could be even better.  Avatar has always had GREAT music to it.
-egQ79OrYCs,"To be fair.. the vast majority of the Avatar Characters were voiced acted by white people. A few main character acceptions were Zuko (VAed by an old Asian guy who looks 15) The first Iroh VA (RIP Mako) and Suki (Jennie Kwan)...

So essentially, the movie cast shares basically the exact same pattern as the Animated Voice Acting cast."
-egQ79OrYCs,agreed
-egQ79OrYCs,i want to see the flying bison!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I think it looks pretty good...oddly.

EXCITED! :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,All I have to say is... there had better be penguin sledding!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Fire Nation^, actually."
-egQ79OrYCs,"1. Katara and her brother are supposed to be BROWN!
2. Aang is suppose to be Asian
3. Zuko has a big scar across his eye and practically half his face. However I see they had no problem making him brown AND HEs THE ONE THATS SUPPOSED TO BE LIGHT SKINED. LMAO
Typical Hollywood would make the main character WHITE!
I know Im being fed Bullshit."
-egQ79OrYCs,hey i wna c momo?? n is this mvie gon b about the whole lyf of aang in one mvie?? or chapters? lyk a series? i hope its a series cuz its too much to cram it all into one mvie!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MrKharyzma

I wasn't sure what word to use, I thought Person of Colour was still in use? If not, I'm sorry for any offense I've caused! I'll be sure to look up a better term for the future!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@shawnhisdead

Um, from what I've gathered they're making three movies for each book (season). Zuko doesn't start his transformation well into the second season and therefore the second movie.  So yeah, he is the bad guy. 

And maybe they didn't ~*MEAN*~ to do it, but it still ended up that way. Personally, I think he would've far better suited Sokka."
-egQ79OrYCs,Epic movie!! a must see
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah, the bad guy is the only coloured person in the cast! Wonderful. -_-"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kevin1451 

EDIT:

I am nothing against Indians but they sure don't look like Prince Zuko. Dave Patel was great at slumdog millionare."
-egQ79OrYCs,The Aang character seems to be a bit serious in this movie.  One of the things that make the cartoon so awesome is that Aang is very childish and fun-loving.  I hope they keep that part of his personality intact.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@azdb04 I am sorry you feel that way, but I am sure the reason why you think Asians don't deserve a leading role in this movie is not because they can't act."
-egQ79OrYCs,@charizard706 Finally a brother that makes sense.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@nofknworries A lot of people have complained about this. I appreciate your reply. I am fully aware that Goku is a ""saiyan"" and thus an alien. But the majority of the fans that actually watch dragonballz was dominantly in the eastern region. After all, it was made by an anime author from Japan. So please tell me why he is played by a white actor? And why is Aang a white actor? Do you have proof that Aang is white? No sir, you don't. The fact is the US can't imagine an Asian protagonist. Period."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@silvoleon 
goku isn't asian in the cartoon series , his an alien from outta space thus why he has a tail and he is in the saiyan race also ang is not an asian in the cartoon series theres no evidence that he is, ang is white"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@R2rGangstaFC haha funny, but a more truthful answer would be, ""White Americans can't even remotely imagine a movie where the protagonist is asian."""
-egQ79OrYCs,"They made a dragonball movie, it sucked. Goku was white, when he's suppose to be asian. There's over a billion ""chinese"" people in China, and they can't find ONE lil prick to be Ang? Wow. I have nothing against whites but there's really something wrong with the casting. Prince Zuko is not indian, and Ang is not white. If anything, Zuko should be white and Ang should be asian. They got zuko and ang mixed up. Who's casting this!? TINKY WINKY!?!??!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Atleast imdb says Dee Bradley Baker is voicing Appa and Momo so i assume they are in the movie :P
-egQ79OrYCs,i watched this trailer in hopes of seeing how they made appa or momo. :(
-egQ79OrYCs,*o* awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,i was going to say the exact same thing but you make it sound so much better. how true. this bullshit needs to end.
-egQ79OrYCs,kitara should be cuter..... lol this movie looks awesome though im just whining a bit
-egQ79OrYCs,Me and my dad are going to see it the day it comes out
-egQ79OrYCs,it's called spam. it's not real. don't believe any comment similar to this one ever.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Jacobsgf 
toph wasnt found till later in the series when aang needs to find a earth master"
-egQ79OrYCs,he has it you just can;t really see it. but trust me it's there
-egQ79OrYCs,I am fine with everything... But where's Zuko's scar??
-egQ79OrYCs,Can't wait. I think it looks great. I loved the series. It looks pretty accurate to me. I don't see why everyone is complaining.
-egQ79OrYCs,everything but aang is good... i think he looks wayyy to young
-egQ79OrYCs,lol ur right
-egQ79OrYCs,@ZachTaylorTV the moves r cheesey
-egQ79OrYCs,"@davevirtual0o katara looks like katara
dont ya think?"
-egQ79OrYCs,@bakamesuinu dont see appa...
-egQ79OrYCs,"dang this making me go coocoo 4 d movie already
katara looks like katara
aang's head should be more round.
dont ya think?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"you can see appa in the first trailer; 8 seconds in, on the top left hand corner of the screen; i dont know about MOMO though."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I've heard people complain about Aang's arrow, but I like it this way. The solid blue just wouldn't look right on a real person...would've looked kinda corny"
-egQ79OrYCs,Prince Suko is a slumdog millonaire! lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"shit!!!
anwar what happened to you!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this movie is either going to be amazing or extremely stupid. I absolutely loved the animated version--however, the trailer is leaving me questioning whether or not it will be good. I really hope it will be worth watching!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"already looks literally 10 times better than that piece of shit ""the Happening""."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yea I'm really not sure either. I am absolutely in love with the show but, the casting is questionable.  The special effects look well done though."
-egQ79OrYCs,"im still not 100% sure if i'll go see this when it first comes out.
im not too crazy about the casting."
-egQ79OrYCs,"sht 
lets see how its theese movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf seriously?
-egQ79OrYCs,"theres already talks of making the action figures of all the characters, including appa at least. so theyre there"
-egQ79OrYCs,IM STOKED i love the series.
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol you're right..he's an ok actor though..

i hate how hollywood has a way of destroying good series/films by making ridiculously crappy remakes. 
ah well we're just gonna have to wait and see"
-egQ79OrYCs,"They kind of over did this, but I still wanna see it :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"no thanks i don't use face book or myspace,
i just don't like it when directors change key points in a movie.
why don't you start a group telling people not to complain?
anyway please don't try and change people minds about such small things, it says you have nothing better to do than read comments and tell people they are wrong :)
i'm allowed to have an opinion, thank you very much"
-egQ79OrYCs,the girl playing katara kinda sounds like her
-egQ79OrYCs,plz dont mess up! i cant wait to see this at midnight
-egQ79OrYCs,"im pretty sure everyone in the cartoon looked asian, spoke like and asian, and fought like an asian"
-egQ79OrYCs,SAMEE!!! It's the best thing ever. i feel like it will never be as good but it def has potential
-egQ79OrYCs,I just hope that this doesn't turn into Dragonball: Evolution
-egQ79OrYCs,"aw man. i hope they don't screw this up, i really love this series."
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks pretty good i gonna go c it
-egQ79OrYCs,what a shit!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@gorillacutie 
Everyone dont bother listening to what ''gorillacutie'' said. She is an eleven year old girl...... :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,120 minutes is too short for the first trilogy of this movie. Book 1 had a lot in it...because of this i am expecting a lot more action and less non-action parts.Man i hope Jet is in this movie lol.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@duperman because suspense is what the majority want these days. No chance for anything stupid like child humor. Just like the dark knight, the only difference is that thats what the a batman movie  is meant to look like."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm worried that there going to make the chracters to serious and take away some of the funny silly parts that were in the show. wiki could be lying but according to them it said the director took away some ""slapstick stuff that was there for little kids, the fart jokes"" and it said ""we grounded katara's brother"" I hope the movie still has some funny scenes like it did in the show. =/"
-egQ79OrYCs,@favm360 LOL me too
-egQ79OrYCs,OMFG Can't wait! I take back all i said about 1st trailer lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"@tripleblue1  i agree with you. When i saw the first trailer i thought it was going to suck big time but now, i'm actually starting to think it will rock."
-egQ79OrYCs,hmm some differences but looks like they put this movie in the right hands
-egQ79OrYCs,i though this movie was going to suck but after seeing the trailor there's hope for it. One thing i like about the actors they chose is they seem to sound like the voice actors for the show. As long as the movie isn't all serious like the trailor is i think it could be good.
-egQ79OrYCs,"i thought this was based on a cartoon.

why so serious???"
-egQ79OrYCs,man momo better be in that movie or else ima have a fit lol
-egQ79OrYCs,Hey.  Where's the comedy? :O
-egQ79OrYCs,"se ve k esta pelicula va estar exelente, ya kiero k salga en el cine..."
-egQ79OrYCs,I think it will be just an Extra to the Series.
-egQ79OrYCs,i love every thing about this trailer...expect noah ringer!! its something about him that I just can't connect anng with! we didn't even here him speak! wtf
-egQ79OrYCs,"ima see that movie. yes, yesss i ammm"
-egQ79OrYCs,if this kids voice is high like in the tv show  will laugh my ass of so badly
-egQ79OrYCs,"everything looks good, well except for the fact that Aang looks like he's 7. Literally"
-egQ79OrYCs,holy shit this looks awsome! don't let us down m light
-egQ79OrYCs,"Omg I just thought of it, who's excited to see Appa?!?! Can't wait!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I heard about the 4th season thing too :(

A lot of people think the creators left it that way to let the fans come up with their own conclusion...which I hate! I want answers!

You're totally right about the Zuko thing :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Okay, for all those who say Zuko is supposed to be gorgeous...where does it say that in the series? Nowhere at all...if girls were throwing themselves at him in the series (which they weren't) it would be because he's a prince and future king."
-egQ79OrYCs,this lookz so gud
-egQ79OrYCs,"he got siged on to do all 3 books. So no toph unti 2013, sorry. But it makes the wait even more worth while"
-egQ79OrYCs,"um yeah, im 21, black, go to a HBCU, got put on to Avatar in 08 and knows EVERYTHING possible about the show. It took over me. LOL> I mean its just a cool show!!! Shoot, ill probably see the midnight showing. lol. Sooo excited"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Kinda wish Zuko's scar was a little more noticeable ... It was completely blatant and unmistakable in the cartoon. I had to pause the trailer to look for it here... lol. Otherwise, looks like it's gonna be pretty good. I look forward to seeing it."
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope they kept the simple humor in the movie XD also kind of missed Appa :O
-egQ79OrYCs,ya the show's waaaayyyyy better and always will be. im still looking forward to the movie tho
-egQ79OrYCs,"Sure the movie looks cool, but compared to the original series? Forget this shit, go watch the show."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Okay, relax. I said that they looked like they were four years old, not that they were. I just think that they happen to look really young."
-egQ79OrYCs,@checking00 This movie is not based on the asian world who the fuck told you that. Just because it has some kong fu in it. Does not mean that it is based on the asian world. What religon in the asain world wordships the elements. I dont know of any do you. There is no Kanji in the toon. None what so ever how can this movie be based on the asian world. You people are so consumed with race that you have know idea what the toon or the series is trying to say.
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks good:D 
@darklatios132 
i think exactly the same, race doesn't matter too much, of course i'm a bit disappointed, but they have to act well in the first place..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"It doesn't really matter about the race- as long as they do a good job in acting.. clearly, they wouldn't cast people as certain characters without knowing that they would portray them well.. so I'm gonna hope that they will pull it off. So far, it looks like it could be pretty successful :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"The movie looks good, but I hope they don't screw it up.

I hope they plan on making a trigun movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Looks great but this movie needs more asian actors. I mean really, it takes away from the whole avatar theme which is based on an asian world!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Toph isn't going to be in this goddamn movie people.. Jeez. She will be in the sequel. That is a good thing in my opinion because she will be one of the only cool and interesting new things about the second movie. This movie already has enough going for it to make tons of money. If any movie in the trilogy is at risk of failure, it's the second because the ending won't have a sense of closure like this one or the last one will."
-egQ79OrYCs,ha it would be funny as hell if toph in the 2nd movie ended up being black lol.  i just wanna see who will be cast as toph and azula. i hope the azula girl in the 2nd movie will be hot
-egQ79OrYCs,actually they did lol. i read online that the earth kingdom will have black people in it. earth was a mixture of asian and african american i think i read. but i do remember reading there r blacks for the earth kingdom. they say the director wanted this movie to be multicultural.
-egQ79OrYCs,Id shamalon screws this movie up I'm gonna hurt him
-egQ79OrYCs,dude why is ang white and not asian
-egQ79OrYCs,doesnt look that good
-egQ79OrYCs,whats the background music?
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks soo gay.
-egQ79OrYCs,am still going to see it tho lol for sure cause its avatar come on lol n u kno u make a good point there it would take long boring sequels of the SAME THING we watched on tv....um i wonder if trigun would have a better affect
-egQ79OrYCs,hmm i wonder who will voice momo and apa. in the cartoon the same guy voiced them. and he came up with some really creative noises
-egQ79OrYCs,"i think if they have each season that r two movies, then they can show a lot more. if not it will be just like harry potter. i just dont know why people on here think they will put the entire series in one movie for."
-egQ79OrYCs,"what the fuck is with that survey crap!! you cant watch a movie even if yo complete it.
boycott that site"
-egQ79OrYCs,"why and half of yall call yourselves avatar fans. if yall knew anything toph doesnts show up until the 2nd season.  so she WONT BE IN THE MOVIE. also there will be 3 movies that cover 3 books. azula however u spell her name shows up at the last ep of the 1st season and so on and their dad, well u never truly see him in the 1st two books cuz he is covered in a shadow. so i hope they dont actually show him til the 3rd movie. some fans yall r. go watch nicktoons."
-egQ79OrYCs,theres going to be some bad acting
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol i thought about that too when i 1st heard this movie was being made. i was like how is book 1 going to fit in a 2 hour movie. cuz there is a lot that goes on in the 1st book.  so if they do mash a lot together, it will just look like a hot mess. so chances r they will leave a lot out. but damnit i just hope they leave in cabbage guy lol."
-egQ79OrYCs,??????cantfind it on there
-egQ79OrYCs,u tell them
-egQ79OrYCs,@thebuckrogers22 You really think they can mash the entire series into 2 hours? Good luck with that LOL!
-egQ79OrYCs,u tell them.  people r just so retarded.
-egQ79OrYCs,why r the water tribe people wearing brown and not blue? and wtf uncle is skinny??? he is supposed to be FAT in book 1 and 2 and skinny in season 3. see man if they cant even get the lil details right then u know the major details will be fucked up
-egQ79OrYCs,"i'm a huge fan of the cartoon but this dont look all that. it looks too cgi looking, with all the slowed down fighting. i hate that.  plus these kids dont look like good actors at all. i just hope it is better than what the trailer looks like"
-egQ79OrYCs,totally. like the iceberg doesnt look anything like it does in the movie. katara and soka outfits r supposed to be BLUE and when they found age the water wasnt frozen over. they were on a boat in the water.  aang tattoos r kinda neat and more realistic but zuko's barely has a scare
-egQ79OrYCs,The cartoon version is so much better
-egQ79OrYCs,oke thanks :) I am definitely going to watch this movie I really loved the series!
-egQ79OrYCs,"woah,, aang is way too young and ugly and why the hell is that indian playing zuko??"
-egQ79OrYCs,@gealach: yup this movie is only this 1st season
-egQ79OrYCs,WHY  ARENT THEY ASIAN!!!?????
-egQ79OrYCs,not to mention all the love of the later seasons :P
-egQ79OrYCs,"Hope this isn't a disappointment like dragonball z 
was"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hope so, that means there might be more movies :D But that does mean we will not see good (and cute) zuko and azula and her friends, and they make it so much more interesting!"
-egQ79OrYCs,OHMAZING
-egQ79OrYCs,"Will the movie only focus on the first season of the ""Avatar: Last Airbender"" series?"
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope they remember that the show has a pretty great sense of humor.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Appa & Momo will be in the movie, but animated, ofcourse ;)"
-egQ79OrYCs,the sokka from the movie doens't seem so funny as the original! =/
-egQ79OrYCs,"Actually, Katara does look-a-like imo. The only one I still don't really.. like, is Sokka. But that could change when I see the movie :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,"The affects look awesome, but they got the characters all wrong they dont look like the ones from the show barley at all, im still gonna see it though"
-egQ79OrYCs,wtf they dint even give them bitches a tan wtf
-egQ79OrYCs,ban m. night shoogadoobeeedoo!  he's a bad director!  hack!  no talent!  spineless!  ban m. night shooobadan!
-egQ79OrYCs,"im not gonna lie.. this movie look really retarded... 
just an opinion"
-egQ79OrYCs,For those who are wondering..Toph will be on the 2nd installments..Director is making it a Trilogy just like the 3 seasons of the show. So this will be Book 1. And Appa is on this film..You can see him on one of the early trailers.
-egQ79OrYCs,Happy fifth year aniversary of Avatar The Last Airbender!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"ok i dont liek this movie at all, they changed the arrows, zuko doesnt even have a burned eye, katara looks ugly as all hell, and it looks liek the movie is gonna be all slow mo so basically its gonna be another matrix. i swear if they wreck teh tv show i might smack a bitch...."
-egQ79OrYCs,I dont think that this movie is going to be good.
-egQ79OrYCs,i dont know i want it to be great but i dont have high hopes THEY CHANGED HIS ARROWS :(  however at 0:52 that looks just like the show so i dont know what to think about it
-egQ79OrYCs,"no, i think the cartoon had it it first.. its been out for years before avatar(the blue people movie) came out... and he even used the writing from the series to write ""avatar""... i think it was a marketing technique b/c why would he use both the name and the writing?"
-egQ79OrYCs,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh cant waittttttttttttttt
-egQ79OrYCs,cant wait.... :-O
-egQ79OrYCs,aaaaaa zuko con pelo largo y en toda la cabezaÂ¿?Â¿? . . . por lo menos se ve q han respetado el libro agua.
-egQ79OrYCs,"why didnt they call this movie avatar: the last airbender
cause that's kinda what this movie's based off of"
-egQ79OrYCs,uhh... ok.....
-egQ79OrYCs,"LOL he says ""your destinies are tied, Zuko"" LOL how did you get the best thing is ahahahahahahaha nice nice i love it when people mistake words with the real thing. Especially funny in music."
-egQ79OrYCs,niice
-egQ79OrYCs,lol looks just as bad as db evolution did
-egQ79OrYCs,à¸­à¸¥à¸±à¸
-egQ79OrYCs,"I will have to disagree, the main story of a world at war and a genocide of an entire nation makes it easily adaptable to a more serious action based movie.  But yea I will miss the fun childish antics and anime elements.  It may still be in the movie but just not highlighted in the trailer."
-egQ79OrYCs,i think the movie gave justice.... the trailers really good.. im gonna wait for this
-egQ79OrYCs,"TIME TO MAKE ANOTHER LIGHT HEARTED CARTOON SHOW INTO A SUPER SERIOUS, GRIMDARK MOVIE.

I was seriously cringing throughout this trailer. Sure, some parts looked cool, but throwing the characters of Avatar in some broody, sulking environment makes everything so corny and forced."
-egQ79OrYCs,"what music is that?
is that a song or orginal score?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Looks much better than I was expecting
-egQ79OrYCs,"the traier's are looking good looking good ,to bad he didnt flim dragonballz lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,Oh yeah!! Iroh! haha i love uncle iroh so darn funny
-egQ79OrYCs,"Haha, so true, i've been talking to people about this for ages and they'd be like, ""what the movie with the blue people?"""
-egQ79OrYCs,You guys should appreciate the fact that they arn't showing you guys the whole fucking movie like they did with new moon! I don't see whats wrong with this trailer...it looks dead on so far except for the fact that I didn't see aapa.  sokka and katara are dead on as far as actors...so what if they arn't darker! i just wish that they would have had taylor lautner as prince zuko....considering that he started off in martial arts and all! I'm very excited this trailer diff left me want more
-egQ79OrYCs,Toph's probably not in. Looks like it's just based on book one
-egQ79OrYCs,"Appa is a flying Bison! Not a flying Buffulo! Duh! That means Appa should be played by an American actor because Bison are native to North America. He isn't a buffulo so no foreigners allowed!

I'm not serious. I'm just imitating the stupidity that some people are reasoning with."
-egQ79OrYCs,i'm a huge fan of the cartoon and i don't see whats the big deal and i'm asian.
-egQ79OrYCs,Damn... People are like commenting like every minuete
-egQ79OrYCs,Wrong!!!!!!! Since they're from the south pole they're supposed to be PENGUIN! And this isn't on Earth so you can;t make that assesment.  but seriously? why would you say they're supposed to be eskimo and then say Katara should be Indian?
-egQ79OrYCs,just cant wait... the final say will be AFTER we  see the movie... Lets watch the movie first before we say anything...
-egQ79OrYCs,"@xbaymicx stop being so narrow minded. People copy from other people all the time. If it's useful, use it."
-egQ79OrYCs,Omg... I feel like crying... When I first saw the trailor I was syced... Then I re watch it... They ruined itt!!!! The bastards! Casting is horrible
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ silaku

Taylor Lautner? The guy who plays Jacob in Twilight? I haven't seen Twilight so I know nothing about that guys acting skills but I definitly do not like his look for Zuko. Hes too beefy, haha. Zuko shouldn't be a meathead, even if his scar says otherwise. But no offense to your opinion. I think Dev Patel is best to portray Zuko's internal struggle."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The trailer is amazing, I think Katara's actress looks beautiful, Aang looks cool (perfect made tattoos and overall resemblance to the cartoon), scenes, locations and effects are perfect.

Is it just me or the trailer scenes resemble a lot of  key scenes from the cartoon? I think it's gonna be a great movie by looking at the two trailers i've seen till now."
-egQ79OrYCs,@xbaymicx Because this is not China! It's not made for China.
-egQ79OrYCs,i gotcha.
-egQ79OrYCs,beast wasn't a bad guy. plus i think it would look pretty strange if the beast looked liked a golden retriever on steroids.
-egQ79OrYCs,It's hard for people to not talk about the race issues when the anima version is different from the movie. I personally think the avatar in this movie look funny.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@7831549

I agree, it shouldn't be such a big deal. I didn't mean to sound that way. I was just speaking hypothetically. What races the characters would be if the movie tried to be as realistic as possible. Just food for thought."
-egQ79OrYCs,Hahaha! Infernil has my respect.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@TheWhiteStripes3 

I would've kept the casting the way they did in this movie. rathbone is cute. while I think that dev patel is cute, I personally would've loved taylor lautner in the role of zuko. hot!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,im asian bro lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"Stop bitching about the actors not being Asian. Yes, it's Asian influenced, but it's an AMERICAN animation and most of the characters in the show don't even look very Asian. Also, this clearly isn't the same planet Earth - we don't have the same landmasses/continents/whatever - so language has nothing to do with anything... on their planet everyone speaks the same language."
-egQ79OrYCs,strike the part of the Firebenders being chinese i didn't read the last part of your comment. but i still don't think people should be making a big deal of the race of the characters.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ 7831549

Haha, I couldnt find my first comment so I was just guessing what you meant. Anyway, yeah India gets credit for Buddhism. And I think the cartoon recognized that even though Aang and the Airbenders are based off of the Tibetan branch of Buddhism. They recognized it and showed it by introducing that guru character. Remember? The guy who tries to teach Aang to control the Avatar state? He was obviously Indian. Unfortunately in the movie that means he will look like a villian."
-egQ79OrYCs,You're just saying that cuz you're white :D
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't remember seeing a black guy in any of the avatar cartoons. O well.  Who gives a shit about race.  This movie is going to be awesome.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@7831549 
actually, firebenders were white (azula, zuko, zhao, et al) while the airbenders appear chinese (i.e. monk gyatso). but unlike the unsatisfied lot here, i am perfectly fine with the races of the cast, especially aang. If I was Shyamalan and I have an Indian heritage and I get to pick who'd play Zuko, heck, I'd pick an Indian too! The same goes for Azula! and Mei and Tai Lee!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"dude look at the air benders i can't tell honistly but firebenders were defently white, also why the fuck are they toning down there power"
-egQ79OrYCs,"they are screwing up in casting the only white people in the shows were firebenders and half of the earthbenders, airbenders where asian, and water benders and half of the earthbenders were all dark skinned so they were either native american, african, eskimo but i never really saw a white waterbender"
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't think this is going to be like the DBZ movie which was an abomination. I think it is going to be a real cut down version of what the anime was in it's first season. Remember not everyone who goes to watch it are going to be as up-to-date with the series than the current fans are.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Casting Katara as an asian/oriental girl would have been just as bad as casting her as a white girl. They should have got some really pretty Inuit/eskimo/native American girl, haha.
Same goes for Sokka, except for the really pretty girl part."
-egQ79OrYCs,aang seems more cheerful in the anime then this movie...
-egQ79OrYCs,"Twenty years later maybe, but it will never work at all. Accuracy fail-Katara=brown person. Lucy liu may be asian but shes totally Americanized. if you wan't to take it as far as you suggest.  it would still be just as wrong for asian americans to play the part because then they should all be speaking in chinese or japanese. which would still be wrong because everyone speaks and understand the same language, yet they are supposed to be different races? everything is flawed, quit complaining."
-egQ79OrYCs,had potential but they fucked it up with the cast. can't even watch the trailer without laughing.
-egQ79OrYCs,That's also how they choose Rinpoches and other reincarnated and venerated monks.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@7831549

Don't argue with me when I haven't said anything incorrect."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Toph didn't appear in the series until Book 2. Seeing as how this is based only on Book 1, Toph probably won't appear until the 2nd movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I know Buddhism started in India, but the Avatar and air nomads are more influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. Remember in the episode where they told Aang he was the Avatar because he chose certain toys from a large selection when he was little and those toys belonged to him in his past lives? Yeah, thats basically how they choose the Dalai Lama in real life. The Dalai Lama is the leader Tibetan buddhism and he is reincarnated after he dies."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm saying hollywood is completely racist when it comes to live action movies. I've never seen a single asian person star in a movie that wasn't already made popular from another country(I.E: Jet Li, Jackie Chan)"
-egQ79OrYCs,Or a boomerang....
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ha, where Apa? I hope they don't make him look like crap in the movie, thats probablly why they kept him out of te trailers. Overall - I hope it's good because the anime was great, don't kill the series movie, please don't kill it."
-egQ79OrYCs,1:26! how fricken ninja was that!
-egQ79OrYCs,"or the setting could suggest a fantasy realm taht doesnt exsist, 

i dont think it would have looked that much better with asian actors.

I dont know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everyone."
-egQ79OrYCs,WHAT A TWEEST!
-egQ79OrYCs,The Katara is too young and looks too helpless and nice compared to the katara in the anime. And I love how they did Aang's tatoos
-egQ79OrYCs,iroh! you're thinking admiral zhao.
-egQ79OrYCs,umm jet li is too old? geez talk about inconsistencies. you guys are being so picky. forget about the races. this is a fiction story set in a world completely different than our own. get over iiit. i think it looks fun.
-egQ79OrYCs,"racism, is something hard to get rid of.

We tend to make judgements based on the most obious differences beetween us. and of course in the alst half century great strides have been mad in the area of total equality

but we arent quite there yet, i give it two more generations before racism dissapears altogether."
-egQ79OrYCs,they should make jackie chan do the uncle zhao i think? zhao? i forget. Zuko's uncle
-egQ79OrYCs,"Actually Buddhism started in india, so.....not really."
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:26

POWERSLIDE!

hmm, it looks ok."
-egQ79OrYCs,@chevymang72 uh... its just a movie? to make suspense?
-egQ79OrYCs,"the only thing you can compare to dragonball is that the races of the characters do not match, otherwise this movie has a better better budget and director. i can't say anything on the acting talents besides the guy who's playing Zuko, and neither can you until you've seen it. then you'd have some credibility.

 p.s. no one will go near naruto because they would have to make like twelve movies and that would be boring."
-egQ79OrYCs,@illumitabris LOL jet li LOL he cant act a kid
-egQ79OrYCs,@moonshiry otherwise movie will suck if its only 1 part
-egQ79OrYCs,"looks awesome i cant wait. I think asian charcters should be used too. (no offence seems more natural). I hope they dont make aang over powered. Cuz he wasnt in the anime. Also hope they make this 4 books =D or was it 3 Books? cant remember. water, earth, fire (no air right?) yeah 3 books 3 parts hopefully"
-egQ79OrYCs,"But haven't you noticed that its extremely asian style, and all the folks in the show have some asian descent somewhere. Just because its an American made show, doesn't mean the characters aren't asian. Technically, they aren't supposed to be any race. Yet somehow, Hollywood chooses white folk to play most of the parts.

I would've been happier with Jet Li being the avatar and Lucy Liu being Katara."
-egQ79OrYCs,"hey, I understand ur point and don't get me wrong, i'm a hardcore christian too but you have to know that this is just a movie to entertain people. don't get too irritated by it"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Nope........
someone needs to mess naruto up, it's a terrible anime in my opinion."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ chevymang72 

Yes! You are a Jehovah's Witness I assume? Dude, go to my channel and watch my video called ""Jehovah's Fitness: Running and Leaping for God."" It teases you guys!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"hey, I understand ur point and don't get me wrong, i'm a hardcore christian too but you have to know that this is just a movie to entertain people. Don't get too irritated by it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"actually it looks pretty good, all i want is... incredible fights, awesome special effects, i dont care if the whole cast dont match! cuz it never match"
-egQ79OrYCs,That is pretty much what i meant cuz people might think it may be a second movie
-egQ79OrYCs,HOW LONG IS THIS MOVIE GONNA BE BECAUSE IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO MAKE AND YESH I ATE BLUE SKITTLES. o3o
-egQ79OrYCs,"Hmm, if you try to think about it from a logical perspective (which is pointless because it all takes place in a fictitious world), I'd say the firebenders are Chinese. I think that because the Avatar and the way he is reincarnated is totally a symbolization of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhism. Say the airbenders are Tibet. The firebenders wiped out the air nomads. The Chinese have been opressing Tibetans for a very long time. 
But that is just if you over-analyze things like I do."
-egQ79OrYCs,the choreography looks unimpressive. nothing close to the complexity that you can find in an asian martial arts movie. the only convincing character so far seems to be kitara. She looks believable as the character.
-egQ79OrYCs,racist
-egQ79OrYCs,@Setarius seeing the name m.night shyamaln will do that
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ MrDancingDick

My mistake. I thought fugly meant 'fat & ugly'. I guess I'm not up to speed on those kinds of things."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Haha, it would be funny if they had cast Russians for every one of the roles in the movie. Then people would be upset but they wouldn't be able to complain about a lack of ""Asians"". Then to make matters worse, in order to compensate for the broadness of the word ""Asian"", they would have to use the politically incorrect word ""Orientals"" to make their point.

They downside of all this is that the movie would suck balls."
-egQ79OrYCs,umm avatar was never asian. it was drawn in that style but it has always been an american animated show. look it up.
-egQ79OrYCs,I look forward to viewing this movie. It seems fascinating.
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't know. You tell me.
-egQ79OrYCs,"No, Zuko does not look fugly because he is not fat, which is one of the two requirements for fugliness."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DarkForce

Yup. Personally, I don't think this should be compared to Dragonball Evolution as much as it has been. Dragonball Evolution was a disgrace that hollywood made for a quick buck. This movie is going to be awesome. But unlike Dragonball, Avatar is American made and people keep forgetting that."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Gay your as...
I know an Anime when I see one...
ASIAN here...
MORON ,.!.."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah, I was looking forward to a dark-skinned beauty (or future beauty) for Katara. Not this little white girl..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"is this about all of the show, or just Book One? I REALLY HOPE TOFF IS IN IT! she's hilarious. (:"
-egQ79OrYCs,"and by the way. if someone assumes that only asians know martial arts, how does that make him/her racist?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow, m night fell off so hard!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Haha, have Asian-American's really fooled themselves into thinking that Avatar: The Last Airbender is an Asian Anime? The show is American, created by two white guys. Asian Asians know better. Stop feeling entitled."
-egQ79OrYCs,gay this isnt out until july!!! and the cartoon is anime
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is messed up...I love avatar so I'm really care about the details...The only whitest person in the main cast in Zuko...Then they hired an Indian for him?...And Keitara and Soka are like tanned...WHITEST AMONG THE CAST HERE!!!...And Aang should've been Asian...And doesn't look that much serious...

This is Horrific for the Fans of the Cartoon :("
-egQ79OrYCs,OMG I can't wait. I loved this show. I just hope they capture some of the humor of the show. It looks pretty serious so far. July 2nd!
-egQ79OrYCs,soooooooo stoked for this movie. (:
-egQ79OrYCs,"indians are asians, dumbassss. wtf is wrong with you."
-egQ79OrYCs,idc rlly bout the race but i feel they cuda found a better looking kitara maybe less white idk
-egQ79OrYCs,"Its more like a little bruise, i know its pathetic. but honestly, what are you expecting from this movie?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, it looks infinitely better than Dragonball, so...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The movie looks cool but who the hell though up that stupid film title, it is such a clumsy phrase."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Martiinkun Well this show was made by those so called ""white people"" soo technically ""asians"" don't consider this show an ""anime"" get your facts straight, you racist asian :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,@srodriguez95 Well if you saw the show you'd know it has to be a kid.
-egQ79OrYCs,"well actually, Aang is like 100something years old because he was stuck inside that ice globe thing for a whole century"
-egQ79OrYCs,Actually I think James Cameron actually has copyrights to the word Avatar when it comes to movies. I don't think Shyamalan had a choice. But I'm not 100% sure so I'm not arguing with you.
-egQ79OrYCs,giving away appa right now would be bad.  he's a surprise in the series and should be a surprise in the movie too :)
-egQ79OrYCs,umm why are Katara and Sokka white?
-egQ79OrYCs,"katara and sokka are supposed to be like inuit or something.  zuko's scar is nearly invisible.  aang's tattos are supposed to wrap around his back and his arms, not be split, and the girl who plays yuaye better be hot :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,where's toph??
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie better be good
-egQ79OrYCs,"lmao, all american cast for an asian movie, lol. horrible... sounds like the mexican with brad pitt and the last samurai with tom cruise, lmao!! horrible!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Avatar, was made by Americans. Stop calling it an Asian story. Call it an Asian-influenced story if you will. The truth is that they just made the movie in the most profitable way possible. That's all Hollywood is really about.

Plus, if they had been as realistic as possible, and casted some inuits to play Katara and Sokka (which I actually wish they had) and a Tibetan kid to play Aang, Japanophiles would still complain that Inuits and Tibetans aren't Japanese enough."
-egQ79OrYCs,sucks. =/
-egQ79OrYCs,"HA they cant call it ""Avatar"" the last airbender they cant put avatar in it cuz of the avatar movie i bet they were P'oed"
-egQ79OrYCs,",,uhmmm...aang is here...But its better if aang is asian..but..its done already...excited to watch it...huix!"
-egQ79OrYCs,lol.....looks like they squeezed all the seasons into one movie O.O
-egQ79OrYCs,whay in movie trailers do they always show people kissing? With that suspensfull song? -__-
-egQ79OrYCs,"hopefully because M. Night Shyamalan is producing this, it will actually be a good movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hope they don't do this movie like they did Dragonball evolution. i've been watching Dragonball z sence I was a kid, and I felt like they really  messed that movie up bad. I was upset. Please don't do this movie the same way!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,crap aang is not Asian plus not even funny.
-egQ79OrYCs,"wtf, thay shuld have got an asian kid to do aang"
-egQ79OrYCs,smells like dragon ball evolution :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"When Hollywood comes in, you know it's not going to be pretty.  Anything that was in a non-movie format that got turned into a movie always has its reputation stained.  The movies are usually alright, but they could have been so much better..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm also not entirely convinced that this movie is gonna be any good. in the trailer she (Katara) says she ""always knew [he was] real"" referring to the avatar. Remember, fron the series that the avatar is a well documented phenomenon, if mysterious as a person. so it was never a question of whether or not he existed, but where he was when he disappeared."
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm not entirely sure that this will be a trilogy. I mean thats how the tv series was but I'm not convinced that the studio will think of the third season (the worst season, though still very good, IMO, specially the series finale) is that sacrosanct, there wasnt too much to the story in that one."
-egQ79OrYCs,no one is even asian in the movie.i want to see the movie. it looks awesome. also the cartoon is cool
-egQ79OrYCs,Espero que con esta se reinvindique porque las ultimas peliculas que venia sancando eran una terrible caga-da.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@CZ1230

You know what? I just realized I was totally mistaken when I said Shyamalan only makes a cameo in Signs. I think Signs just has his biggest appearance. But I remember now that you can see his reflection at one point in The Village. I don't remember him being in The Sixth Sense though? And I haven't seen Unbreakable or Lady in the Water."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mimionline sorry, this is just the book of water"
-egQ79OrYCs,omfg this movie looks like it's going to be horribly awefull i mean i've seen the cartoon  and the cartoon is quite good but the movie looks like a epic fail waiting to happen but ill see it any ways when it comes out in dvd unless there are some good reviews on it and 80% of the people say it's a good movie then i might see this movie in theaters
-egQ79OrYCs,"STOP WHINING ABOUT ""WHERES TOPH'' well guess what ths is BOOK one or season 1 Toph is in season 21 or book 2"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Toph won't be in this movie because she wasn't introduced until the second book of the cartoon show. She will be in the sequel that will come out 2 or 3 years from now.

Also, Shyamalan doesn't make a cameo in every one of his movies. I've seen all of them except for a couple and his only cameo I've seen is in Signs. He won't be in this movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie shall be epic
-egQ79OrYCs,"more trailers and tears will release dont worry

toph will be in there
shes the main reason to aang knowing earth bending
i couldnt see them not putting her in there that would make no goddamn sense"
-egQ79OrYCs,"i doubt they wouldnt put toph in this, she was one of the main characters, they have Aang, sokka, and katara and zulu, why not toph? and my guess on who shyamalan is gonna cameo as is....a random earth bender? dunno"
-egQ79OrYCs,Don't rule out Aang's childish behavior. Aang might still be goofy in the movie. Maybe he just seems really serious because they only had time to show the intense scenes in the trailer.
-egQ79OrYCs,"man one question.
where's toph.the 
blind girl.the best earthbender,
everthing is good and all
but i just want to see toph.or is
there going to be part two?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Awesome!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@wegonhavefun: I'm actually impressed by the polite and rational way you put your point across :) Bravo. As mentioned in another comment, I would prefer a cast that both racially and culturally reflected the populations of the cartoon with better integrity since I am a fan of the show. This just smacks of Earthsea whitewashing, but you're free to disagree in your very polite way, of course."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@ kentobi88

Go ahead. Unfortunately nobody will see it because it will not have been made in Hollywood."
-egQ79OrYCs,"it looks good. The effects are decent, it follows the story. I just think the actors should have been more asian than white and middle east. But, other than that it looks good. Finally a movie that isnt made of a show that completely effed it up"
-egQ79OrYCs,i wanna see momo and zukos eye cant wait till this movie comes out
-egQ79OrYCs,not sure but I dont think Toph appears in the first book.. and I think that movie is only about the first book
-egQ79OrYCs,"@Sevothsan: Agreed, no one really said they were Asian, despite the extremely Asian settings and architecture of their cities. I guess M. Night was going for a cast which reflected the look of the cartoon characters to a T rather than any sort of implied cultural authenticity. I just personally would have preferred the latter or a good mix between both."
-egQ79OrYCs,"This movie doesn't get to the point where toph comes in, zuko's uncle was standing beside him in the trailer. Zuko's scar is there just not obvious from the angles."
-egQ79OrYCs,100% agree on that.
-egQ79OrYCs,@kunupik toph wasnt in the whole first season shel b in the second movie dnt worry
-egQ79OrYCs,"You know, I feel the casting is wrong for a number of reasons. In the show, a lot of the philosophy and mythos may have been loosely based upon Asian themes, but the characters themselves (regardless of skin color), in mannerisms and personality were white people, very American white people. They couldn't of had a harder group of characters to cast for - you need a bunch of racially nondecript Asian-American white people. Should of just left it a cartoon, but no, theres money to make."
-egQ79OrYCs,im not sure this will be a good movie or a bad 1
-egQ79OrYCs,this trailer is making me a little more hopeful about its success
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't think people have to worry about this movie being anywhere near as bad as Dragonball evolution. It is clear just from this tasty trailer that is will be better. Did you seen how terrible the Dragonball Evolution trailers were? Plus, this movie is staying fairly true to the original show, unlike Dragonball Evolution."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kentobi88

This movie is laughing at East Asians (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese)."
-egQ79OrYCs,"the trailer is all right, but i get the feeling that this movie might fail the same way dragon ball evolution did, but dont give up hopes now, i think this movie MIGHT work who knows"
-egQ79OrYCs,Why are Katara and Soka White and NOT Black
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie looks good and all but the person who plays aang looks to serious with stuff like aang is like a funny and silly kid but i still can't wait!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"No, its going to be a trilogy. This is season 1 all wrapped into one movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie is going to rock.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Haha, some people are so angsty against hollywood. It's funny and pathetic. Angst in general is just lame."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@DeathBlade182

What was M. Night Shyamalan thinking when he casted Dev Patel as Zuko? Probably a number of things. Shyamalan has said in an interview that Zuko is his favorite character from the cartoon (not a surprise) so I doubt he would choose an actor carelessly. He probably realized that as an amazing actor, Dev Patel will do a great job portraying Zuko's constant internal struggle between good and evil. Shyamalan might have also liked the fact that Dev Patel is also Indian, haha."
-egQ79OrYCs,FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU SOOOO MUUUUUCH RAAAAAAAAAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hollywood destroys another part of my youth.
-egQ79OrYCs,i completely agree i hope they kept uncle iroh the same though him and sokka made the cartoon great
-egQ79OrYCs,no i believe there is going to be three diffrent movies for the three books
-egQ79OrYCs,What the bloody hell were they thinking when they chose Zuko?
-egQ79OrYCs,"I still think Noah Ringer doesn't look like a young Monk but a fat and spoiled kid.
And the girl that plays Katara seems so young. How should she do scenes like facing Master Pakku or Azula?"
-egQ79OrYCs,Zuko looks like the guy in slumdog millionare
-egQ79OrYCs,YEAHHHHHH THIS MOVIE LOOKS BADASS!!!!!! I...CANT...WAIT lol....hopefully there willl be a trilogy
-egQ79OrYCs,"ok if he fucks this movie up i will go ripshit... also. the tv show is DEFIANTLY NOT THAT SERIOUS!!!!!!!! wtf is this? the tv show is a funny go loveing  show that had a perfect balance of seriousness too. this isnt that same old loving show. also the cast is WAAAAAAAAAAAY to young. katara is like a little girl, and sauka is is weird looking. zuko dosent even have his scar... and Aang's tattoo isnt blue, and he looks weird."
-egQ79OrYCs,this was sooo much better as a freakin show.
-egQ79OrYCs,ok 1-ZUKO LOOKS HOTTER WHEN HE'S ANIMATED! 2-WHERE'S HIS FREAKIN BURN MARK?! AND 3-ANG LOOKS LIKE HE'S 5!
-egQ79OrYCs,I love avatar but from the looks from this trailer the movie is going to be shit...... the mistake they made was choosing the guy who did the happening........
-egQ79OrYCs,this is probably the best epic story next to the lord of the rings trilogy. if they were smart they'd make it a trilogy
-egQ79OrYCs,"who cares if the casting is terrible, look at the affects! and at least its gonna follow the story, unlike that horrible movie ""lightning thief"". the books were good, but again, horrible movie. but i am excited for this one all the way!"
-egQ79OrYCs,this better say where zuko's mom is and saaka better be just as funny as in the show
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, the actors sound right."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Anyone know the music please tell meh Dx .
.
.
.btw awesome trailer =D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"well the casting seems a bit odd and i really liked it as a cartoon but it looks like theyve at least stuck to the storyline from what i see here, as long as they have appa and momo..."
-egQ79OrYCs,So freaking excited!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah the casting is terrible :\
-egQ79OrYCs,"oh man this is gonna be so beast!!
so BADASS! hands down"
-egQ79OrYCs,they shud have just let the people from the tv show be in diss movie........epicness
-egQ79OrYCs,looks good but terrible casting.....
-egQ79OrYCs,hey that one guy that plays jasper cullen is in this cool! and this looks awesome im so guna see this!
-egQ79OrYCs,eh i still prefer the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sephorastar07 
WOOT WOOT :P"
-egQ79OrYCs,"its m.night. shyamalan! its gunna have a ridiculous twist like it was all a dream or the yellow power ranger goes back in time and stops it...just look at 'the happening', completely rubbish film"
-egQ79OrYCs,looks awsome!
-egQ79OrYCs,jackson rathbone is in this movie
-egQ79OrYCs,"1:19 Harru?

Dev Patel....i must admit, looks like he will make a good Zuko. He doesnt look Goofy which was the thing i was worried about. He looks really hardcore.

I think although the characters are not Racially what we wanted, the actors are atleast good enough to pull off the characters so we shouldn't care about RAce, just how well teh actors are and they look alright.

Not sure about Aangs humor since no trailer has shown it.
I cant wait to see this film."
-egQ79OrYCs,they put the aw in awsome
-egQ79OrYCs,I'm not racist or anything but the characters are suppose to be asian... haha oh well hope the movie is good.
-egQ79OrYCs,awesome
-egQ79OrYCs,"dawg, THIS LOOKS SO SOLID!!!!!

-_- it had better not let me down!!!!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,yeah a lot of things r a little different but i think it will be a good movie     i just cant wait 2 find out about toph & stuff in the 2nd. but i hope they have an appa & momo ^__^
-egQ79OrYCs,i think this is awesome!! i LOVE avatar and i was afraid but I think it looks pretty good =) he included yuri!! thats so exciting!! i hope they keep some of the funny in it.. like sokkas wise cracks lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is like a dream come true for me. When I first watched the cartoon I immediately fellin love with it. My only regret however was that it was a kid show, and not as intense as it could have been had it been rated for older audiences. The concept is creative, the story amazing, and the cast of characters (especially Zuko-my favorite) was far too good to be a kids show.

I really hope this is not a big disappointment (like Eragon) and is not rated like PG."
-egQ79OrYCs,haha i agree with the zuko part...except hes indian :P
-egQ79OrYCs,haha seriously this movies gonna be sick even the water bending and this is supposed to be a trilogy for every season of avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,"wow, the effects are amazing. My fav. part is the water bending one :P
but i do agree that they could have done better with the characters. Sokka and katara are suppost to be dark skin. And zuko isnt mexican...but nice effects :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"PagePlant77 your retarded, its inspired by Avatar? are you really that dumb, inspired movies don't have the EXACT SAME NAME DUMBAZZ"
-egQ79OrYCs,Katara and Sokka are black not white.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, here is a devoted fan hoping this movie doesn't suck."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The actors and the characterization is a shit.
Fat Ang,white and gayface soka,white katara.
But the effects are amazing.This movie it had that to be adapted by zack snyder.This movie will be only effects good effects and nothing more."
-egQ79OrYCs,@csimoes91 it sucks that you kidding! i totally almost went crazy with i saw the earth bending scene....talk about a visual orgasm
-egQ79OrYCs,@isyfrisco oh yeah the blue spirit did rescue aang from the fire nation prison! very good eye you have
-egQ79OrYCs,and 1:18 is prob haru
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah the movies gonna be awesome when they shot the earthbending scene I almost jizzed my pants haha just kidding
-egQ79OrYCs,omg i didn't even get to really see yuri's face but i'm sure she is cute. saka is hot as shit omg the twilight guy really burns my blood right now he is sooooo fine! but the only thing i have to say is that I would have loved loved loved to see taylor lautner as prince zuko! he is a martial arts champion and it would have translated well! it would have been gret for his career to show that he could be a villian.....other than that I'm very pleased!
-egQ79OrYCs,at 1:13 im pretty sure aang is fighting with the blue spirit
-egQ79OrYCs,people asking were is toph ...the movie is based off book 1. that means toph is not in it.
-egQ79OrYCs,Not sure what to think of the trailer. I'm a crazy fan of the show. I own the first 2 seasons and have seen every single episode. I hope the movie is good.
-egQ79OrYCs,@smileburger i can't wait for toph to show up! also I'm excited to see zuko's sister and fire lord ozi! the last airbender is my life and I can trully say that I'm a fanatic! Why are people hating so much like wtf i don't clown on lord of the rings or star wars....so don't come over here with that negative shit! From what I see so far from this trailer....the story looks dead on! very excited !!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I'm excited, exept I have to wait until July AND for the next 2 movies to come out!! (There's going to be 3, just like the seasons of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" if  you didn't know...)"
-egQ79OrYCs,omg toph doesn't show up til the 2nd season and this is just about the first!!! sorry everyone is saying this...
-egQ79OrYCs,haha yay someone is with me! I was practically jumping up and down...be July already!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I know I really don't like how some of the characters are being portrayed. However, they can't show Toph, she doesn't show up until the 2nd season, and this movie is just about the first. I don't think he fails :("
-egQ79OrYCs,"I can't wait too see this, an awesome realistic edition of one of my all-time favorite animated TV shows! :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"well in the world of avatar the cartoon,
people in the air temple look like shaolin monks so their chinese
fire nation i think looked japanese
earth nation looked korean
and the sokka and kitara were eskimos
so i guess they could find any lol

if they do a naruto live action, i will laugh if they screw that up"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I totally agree. Plus I personally don't think it's the easiest thing to take an animated show and turn it into real life. I'm a little bummed that Aang didn't even speak in the trailer...the whole time he was serious, and he's supposed to be a fun loving kid! But I understand though..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"i just looked up the toys coming out for the movie they show appa and The Blue Spirit.

so Zuko is probably going to help Aang as  The Blue Spirit at some point in the movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Gonna be the sickest movie of 2010 too bad that homo twilight comes out two days before this, loved the cartoon and this movies gonna make the whole concept better."
-egQ79OrYCs,"omg get over it people. the movie is NOT going to be EXACTLY like the series... if it was EXACTLY like it, what would be the point of seeing it? there needs to be something different if not just watch the animated series jeez..."
-egQ79OrYCs,"AHA i will render the arguement that avatar should have an asian cast invalid. the lost most often used is that the show was absed of of asian culture.

And Russia is a country primarily in asia . . . . . .

I WIN"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@xxxAnimeFreakxxx1 actually, it is. I just checked on imdb. I'm sad."
-egQ79OrYCs,this is cool
-egQ79OrYCs,"arabic or inuit, the water nation is supposed to be a combination of the two cultures, and physically i think they are closer to arabs, but they could be inuit aswell

that is the only thing that is bothering me iis that they are building the fire nation cast from arabic and indians actors, not a good time in the real worlds history to be portraying middle eastern folks as bad guys"
-egQ79OrYCs,":[ Why is Kitara white? Not saying she was a darker ethnicity, but she was darker-toned in the show, as was Sokka. Why do we have these pale kids running around? And I want Toph! blaaargh M. Night Fails me."
-egQ79OrYCs,im been waiting for this
-egQ79OrYCs,intense. this is gonna be better than the cartoon! didn't the guy who's playing sokka kinda looked like jasper from twilight?
-egQ79OrYCs,jesus i just about pissed myself! as a fanatic allow me to say how super duper excited i am right now
-egQ79OrYCs,who said they were asian?
-egQ79OrYCs,"y are we argueing race? its a fictional universe, there is no china, america britian, ect."
-egQ79OrYCs,Naruto meets Crouching tiger.....mmm I will rather see clash of the titans
-egQ79OrYCs,"I hate this race argument! The show is an AMERICAN cartoon influenced by asian culture, that doesnt mean the characters are asian! If you wanted to make it closer to the cartoon in regards to race, the Water tribe would be hispanic or something, the air nomads would be asian, fire nation would probably be white, and the earth kingdom would be like european or something."
-egQ79OrYCs,"well, i dont think the casting was done on color. I think they maybe probably actually wanted some people who could actually.. I dunno....ACT?"
-egQ79OrYCs,"why not, he's a good actor."
-egQ79OrYCs,this actually looks like it might be good.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wow, that may be true, but have you not watched the cartoon? It is heavily implied that these characters are asian. The story is built up on Asian mythology and the cartoon borrows from Asian art. Traditional East Asian calligraphy styles are used for nearly all the writing in the show. The shows influences include Chinese art and history, Buddism and Taoism. Although I don't believe Shyamalan intended this to be racist and I don't think it's racist, the characters would make sense to be asian."
-egQ79OrYCs,i think they could of done better with the casting process. i mean for sokka and katara. they could of gotten someone more their COLOR! i mean duh! why make them white? not trying to be prejudice here but its the truth! and definantly could of done better with zuko. i mean seriously. why that guy? what is he from? slum dog millionare? thats so stupid! seriously!
-egQ79OrYCs,ohh! thats a good way of thinking of it. i hadn't thought of that.
-egQ79OrYCs,WOW iÂ´m really impressed i really think itÂ´s gonna be a great movie.i defenetly gonna watch it and then we will see how good it is.
-egQ79OrYCs,"They should sue for copyright infringment.... fucking obvious. This show was called, Avatar the last airbender was it not? Besides that little grr moment, Sokka fits well. Dnt really think they should have showed the fight scenes so much. Where's the funny??"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Me too, not to mention, ~*~TOPH~*~!"
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko is from slumdog millionaire :S
-egQ79OrYCs,if they do make a sequel for book 2 i want to see Ty lee and Mai in it :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"Sorry, Toph is not in this movie because this about Book One: Water, if they make sequel on Book 2: Earth Toph will definetley be in it. :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"ill put it in plain english. The director is trying to make the movire realistic, on a more serious level so stop complaining everytime something doesn't look exactly like the cartoon"
-egQ79OrYCs,naw it's satying true to the events of the cartoons but be realistic here it can never look exactly like the cartoon
-egQ79OrYCs,he did watch the show. he quoted that it's now a regular event with his family. He also stated that the reason for watching the show in the first place was when hi daughter wanted to be katara for halloween
-egQ79OrYCs,his daughter actually
-egQ79OrYCs,"Yeah... Aang and Katara look like their four years old. It's kind of weird. I get that they're supposed to be twelve, and everything, but still..."
-egQ79OrYCs,im sorry but i have a feeling this movie will be an epic fail :(
-egQ79OrYCs,"............Tis movie is off key in all ways even a person whos NOT a fan wuld recognize these errors....""Like the guy just got a description of the movie from his son"" Should'v watched th cartoon himself"
-egQ79OrYCs,@ all the WHERES TOPH idiots... WHERE IS YOUR BRAIN????? if you love Toph you would have loved her introduction... the blind bandit book two ep 6 she isnt in book one...
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie is all based on the first season. Toph will come out in the second movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,toph is in the second season so she will be in the next last airbender movie.
-egQ79OrYCs,zuko's uncle is in the trailer. zuko's scar is a bit faded. but u can tell theres something red in this left eye in the scene where he has his hood on.
-egQ79OrYCs,"See, this is why the movie industry needs to stay away from popular cartoons, anime and video games. They always want there own input into a popular franchise yet know nothing about it, if your not going to represent something correctly, leave it alone pricks."
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah. You can totally judge a 2 hour movie based on quick flashes of martial arts in a 2 minute trailer and the way one actor looks.
-egQ79OrYCs,@angelwidplaguez  appa is the flying bison right? its in the movie you can see it in the top left corner of the first trailer when Ang is looking towards the crowd/figts
-egQ79OrYCs,"It is multicultural on the show. And this movie is NOT European. In any sense. It's completely multicultural. The Water Nation are white, sure, but the Fire/Earth/Air Nations are all composed of Asian's .. meaning this is as European as China Town is if one white guy is in it. I think you need to stop looking at their skin color and start looking at how well they portray the characters. If the creators of the show endorsed this, that's good enough for me."
-egQ79OrYCs,appa and momo arnt in it... same with toph
-egQ79OrYCs,i wish Toph is in it too
-egQ79OrYCs,that's Avatar (cartoon) but made in film right?
-egQ79OrYCs,Yeah u would. U know damn well your gonna end up watching it
-egQ79OrYCs,I wonder who's going to play Toph in the next film..
-egQ79OrYCs,I think this movie is going to be awsome. Please do realize that only so much can be revealed in a trailer. Never the less I am a huge fan and am going to love the movie anyway. :>
-egQ79OrYCs,"Appa is in the trailer released for the superbowl.  Don't worry, he's in the movie [:"
-egQ79OrYCs,Poeple calm down you can only do soo much with a movie I believe its going to be amazing never the less. If your a true fan you'll love it anyway. and appreciate that M.Night is taking his time to make this amazing series into a movie just be happy he's trying.
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks like it's going to be  a trilogy because everything in this trailer looks like it's from the first season from the cartoon.....hence no toph (i really don't think that earthbender was toph)..........plus i would feel really disappointed if they tried to cram a whole 3 seasoned cartoon into an at best 2 hour movie
-egQ79OrYCs,Toph wont be in this movie... she will be in part 2
-egQ79OrYCs,"@kunupik IF SHE IS NOT IN THERE, I WILL BE ANGRY. D:"
-egQ79OrYCs,i hope u're right about that
-egQ79OrYCs,"peaceroxangel i agree wit u, although that won't stop either of us from seein da movie"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this trailer is fuckin beast, the most epic shit i ever seen. But, why are the fire nation indians? They should be asian, and da water tribe is white, when they should be indian. And i hope da next trailer show Appa and Momo"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this better be good, but, where the heck is momo and the flying bison?"
-egQ79OrYCs,i like the new symbols
-egQ79OrYCs,Two minutes of pure epicness.
-egQ79OrYCs,it looks great. so am i to belive that this will be a 3 movie saga it goes by the books in the cartoon for each part
-egQ79OrYCs,"why are the fire benders Indian? thought they should be Asian 
thats weird
but the rest looks great"
-egQ79OrYCs,They made them waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to different from the show aang is supposed to be loose and funny sometimes serious but in this movie he acts like an emotionless kid oh and they changed how the clothes are and the symbols.
-egQ79OrYCs,aang is much more serious in the movie than he is in the cartoon which is GREAT
-egQ79OrYCs,"I get the feeling that this trailer is making just making the matieral seem much darker than it is. Then again Shyamalan is making it, he's not exactly known for being light-hearted with his visual style"
-egQ79OrYCs,"lol, you nailed that one"
-egQ79OrYCs,i feel bad for the producers. it must be hard to make wind seem real and powerful
-egQ79OrYCs,"This movie is going to be much darker and much more fierce than the original show. I think this will be better, and much more epic..cant wait"
-egQ79OrYCs,@wegonhavefun Like there aren't any like that in America *sarcasm*.
-egQ79OrYCs,WHAT THE FUCK!
-egQ79OrYCs,sickkkk
-egQ79OrYCs,ANWAR
-egQ79OrYCs,"I say they just shoot the last two Harry Potter films with an all Asian cast. Just to be fair. I find this films casting really cynical, espcially in an age were films with Asian starts play all the friggin time."
-egQ79OrYCs,holy shit  have to watch=)
-egQ79OrYCs,jacson rathbone is soo hot ! i wish aang was a bit whiter..and older
-egQ79OrYCs,"Dude, the storyline is based on the first season of the TV series."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The cast is whitewashed :/ Don't tell me that in all of China you could not find a chinese martial artist child actor who fit Aang's look? I'm not going to speculate on why Shayamalam casted it this way, but I hope there is more to this than blatant pandering to a white market."
-egQ79OrYCs,I don't like the cast at all =(
-egQ79OrYCs,Anyone know the music?
-egQ79OrYCs,what a twist lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"I know it's not in Japan... I said it  was in a made up world. I know it was made in America but it doesn't mean the show is set in America..  :)

@kenjm4eva I'm only giving my opinion, dude. I'm just disappointed with the cast :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this isnt in japan.
sigh....

this wasnt an anime show. It was american inspired by anime. o_O Katara fits well.. so does sokka"
-egQ79OrYCs,gotta bitch about something huh!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I love the action, costumes, asian influenced world in the film, but I don't like the cast (Sokka and Katara are OK, but they could have at least gave them a tan and make them look Inuit). Even though the show isn't set on earth, but in a made up world, it's still an Inuit and East Asian styled world. In the show, the buildings, music, the costumes, etc. look asian.
And since the characters names sound east asian and they also LOOK asian in the show, it's pretty obvious they're NOT white."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@HacksawIs4 Hacks, I'm assuming you're some stupid ass 12 year old kid because that is the stupidest answer I have heard. 
First off anime doesn't mean it's Japanese. AVATAR is an american show inspired from an anime style BUT if you're talking about the animation itself then it's drawn by the koreans... which a lot of shows are. and you people grumbling about the casting. Do yourself a favor and shut the hell up. Just because it's not 100% true you go and bitch like some fan boy."
-egQ79OrYCs,why katara doesn't look older than angg???
-egQ79OrYCs,Trailer actually gave me a nice chill. So far I say it's gonna be good. Speedracer really got me by suprise and yea... Dragonball was Fail... but oh well! as a fan I will always go see these types of movies. Good or bad I am a fan.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Doesn't the show take place ALL OVER THE WORLD rather than just japan? i mean,Technically there is no Japan, There map is a lot different from ours. HOWEVER there should be a more divserse cast since Aang and his friends do travel around the world. And since Katana and the other guy (forgot his name) are unmistakablely darkskin in the Show. Also Characters like Prince Zuko and his family look asian in the show. And i understand they used Indians but.. That's not the same."
-egQ79OrYCs,sure katara and socka don't look wriite. but i think anng looks quite chinesse other than he's not skinny enough
-egQ79OrYCs,looks fake and gay...
-egQ79OrYCs,"You're wrong in .. every aspect, it seems. The storyline is consistent with the cartoon (so you must not like the cartoon), M. Night is an amazing director (his stories aren't great, however, but that doesn't effect his directing skill) and .. the type-casting is a great change. While the cartoon was heavily based on Asian culture, the creators didn't explicitly want to make an entire world of just Asian's, as per interviews. It makes a lot more sense to have the casting they did."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Wha? Michael Bay is a horrible director. All he can do is make explosions. That's it. Now, maybe all the scenes with the Fire Nation bombing stuff might be better with Michael Bay but everything would be shit. M. Night is a great director .. he's just not a great writer. Most of his stories tend tog"" be a bit hackneyed and corny but he isn't writing this. Just directing, which is the good part. You seem to just like Bay because he made big robots fight and have sexy women. A lil juvenile to me."
-egQ79OrYCs,"They're here .. I believe Chinese is Earth so they probably won't be around until the second movie. But .. the characters from the show were never ""Chinese"" .. they were always just ""random cultural Asian things mashed together."" Lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I like the trailer, but they definitely shouldn't try to do the whole series in one movie. IMO, it'd be waaaay better to do a trilogy or something. 

A movie for each ""book"" would work fine. This way, there's more room for character development and those who haven't seen the cartoon won't be so easily lost."
-egQ79OrYCs,im in love with this show!!!!!! its the most amazing thing evr!!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"I can't wait to see this movie! I love the T.V. show, and the new trailer already looks really great!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Michael Bay cannot direct a movie with a good story in for the life of him. While transformers was a visual feast on the eyes, the story and acting made me want to cry. That is where M Night Shamalan strengths lie. Think the Village and 6th Sense. How amazing was the story/ acting in those? Some of the best direction I have seen."
-egQ79OrYCs,is appa gonna be in the movie?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Special effects look decent, but theyre gonna need way more than that to pull off this Movie."
-egQ79OrYCs,@ tretang666 no shes not in this movie but only because its a triogy and she dosnt come out until the second season so she wont be out until the second movie i suppose but yeah shes my favorite too so i cnt wait til the second one to c who they cast as her lol
-egQ79OrYCs,i think that guy looks too serious to play the role of Sokka lol
-egQ79OrYCs,"Im not really sure what to make of this, on one hand i wish they would've had asian actors since its a madeup world of asian culture, but i will still c it, cuz it's avatar, and i loved the show, i hope its good and not a flop."
-egQ79OrYCs,where are the chinese people???
-egQ79OrYCs,"so, momo and appa are cgi.. but where is zuko's scar?? anyways, what is wrong w/ u people?? if u don'l like it the movie, then don't watch it.. that simple.. besides, cartoon has a big difference in live action thing *whatsoever* just enjoy the movie, criticisms is okay but don't make a big fuss out of it.. btw.. soka is cute.. hehe"
-egQ79OrYCs,"I am twenty one years old and have watched all three seasons of avatar...and loved it!!!!

I think the characters match well. I don't understand why people are mad that the cast is not composed of Japanese people. The show never indicated that it took place in Japan"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Actually Heres the BIG!!! problem....M. NightTakesashitonhimselfconsecutively touched the movie, Why the Hell didnt Michael bae touch it if michael bae did...than this will be a hit...tho he'd have to adapt to veering away from sexy women and what not in the movie lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,Dante Basco for Zuko
-egQ79OrYCs,lol yeah cuz those other idiots took the name
-egQ79OrYCs,I agree with the CGI...looks like DBevolution took a turd...despite the fact that its turd is guaranteed to be better than it is
-egQ79OrYCs,I honestly think the element animation looks pretty crappy
-egQ79OrYCs,"I dont like the actor for Aang...way too asian, and he doesnt seem like an animated kid...Ide rather have a shaved Justin Beiber than this kid...might as well make it Japanese dub lol"
-egQ79OrYCs,true. I'd rather have better actors over looks. They should've at least gotten a few asians though.
-egQ79OrYCs,"the avatar kid looks like he's 7...wtf. and zuko is WAAYYYY off. and sokka is just......idek, theres something wierd about him..."
-egQ79OrYCs,yes yes yes oh wait YES
-egQ79OrYCs,the actress playing princess yue is the most beautiful girl in the world
-egQ79OrYCs,i agree with the whle white sokka thing. i mean dont get me wrong im not racist or anything but wouldnt it have made more sense if sokka and katara were Asian along with everyone else in the movie?
-egQ79OrYCs,"toph is not in this season cause she wasn't in book one, we should see her in earth."
-egQ79OrYCs,where's Aapa!!??
-egQ79OrYCs,hey i don't think the white people make more sense. They should have picked the people according to the race in the show and also the acting skills. if u saw the show avatar is multicultural not european.
-egQ79OrYCs,"the sokka guy looks creepy, and looks like hes gonna cry when he says the rebellion line. zuko looks nothing like the original character. aang seems too serious(hopefully he lightens up in the movie). also, is that IROH wth Zuko, wtf happened to him??"
-egQ79OrYCs,dude u stfu.
-egQ79OrYCs,DUDE THATS EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT!
-egQ79OrYCs,well cuz wen i heard the movie was comin out i heard alot of ppl sayin what the cast was gone be like an alot of ppl dont like when movies arent consistent with watever they came from(well at least ppl i noe)
-egQ79OrYCs,"@losinglenore  Do -your- research. Because it's American made does not predispose them to racism for depicting a certain race as having a history and trend towards the application of Martial Arts. Martial Arts -did- originate in Asia. The real world races most closely resembling those in the cartoon were Inuit (Not Asian, kind of kills that point), Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan. If you watched the show, the cultural mirrors to those in the real world implies them to be Asian."
-egQ79OrYCs,possibly but if its like the show then they dnt start showin affection till later
-egQ79OrYCs,that makes sense but i think ppl r more taken by surprise bcuz the skin color doesnt match the show. but when i heard they were makin this movie i knew the charaters would be different so yea
-egQ79OrYCs,How so?
-egQ79OrYCs,"Personally, I think the movie is going to be epic .. and that's coming from a huge fan of the series. The white people make absolutely more sense than anything portrayed in the series. It would be kind of odd for an entire world just to be of one race like in the series. Having more Icelandic people playing the Water nation, which is dominantly more ice than anything in the series, is a good choice."
-egQ79OrYCs,yea her name is toph but she doesnt come till later. the 3rd book i think
-egQ79OrYCs,well this is the 1st movie she shouldnt have it cuz i dnt think she got it untill the second book?. idk some 1 correct me if im wrong
-egQ79OrYCs,wow im speechless the awful casting is wat i have a problem with an the overly dramatic tattoo yet.... im still probably gona c the movie anyway cuz im nt gona lie it does look interesting
-egQ79OrYCs,I think the narator in this trailer is Avatar Roku
-egQ79OrYCs,"Man, my hair stood on end when I saw Princess Yue."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Zuko has a scar, it's just not very apparent in these clips. it's there. look around for better pics.

they made the nations more racial. Fire- Indian, Earth- Chinese, Air- dunno. just seen ang so far. and Water- they chose white folks due to having blue eyes and the fact that Inuit's arnt exactly the most attractive as a whole.  Think russian. plus it makes the nations easier to identify to people who dont know the entire story from the cartoon.

Angs tatoos are of the 4 winds NOT a cross."
-egQ79OrYCs,1:17 is that Iroh? Is that when he became angry when Zhao killed the moon spirit?
-egQ79OrYCs,Some things are better left alone. They should have never tried to make this cartoon into a movie. Those who watched the cartoon will never be satisfied with this movie. WTF with the white ppl? Hopefully their acting is good enough for that not to matter.
-egQ79OrYCs,"I don't mind the cast being white.  I don't know too many Asians with blue eyes.  That being said, they still did an awful job with casting.  It is very distracting.  And not having Sifu Kisu on board with the project?  Booooo!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"okay, i'm pumped!"
-egQ79OrYCs,and not stick to the characters at all...wtf is all the little tattoos about? and Zuko being Middle Eastern with no Burned Eye?
-egQ79OrYCs,ya zuko's scar isnt like apparent enough :/ still looks awesome though :D
-egQ79OrYCs,"This guy sucks ass...I swear hes so corny, wayta white wash everyone and make Zuko middle eastern...WITHOUT HIS BURNT EYE!!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Dick Face Sham-o-Lot is only making the first book
-egQ79OrYCs,"@siriuslynow 
The white washing of the cast seems much more distracting than I first thought. Katara just made me laugh. Maybe they should remake the Harry Potter movies with Asians."
-egQ79OrYCs,"why does everyone compare Avatar to anime, its not an anime nor was it meant to be an anime.  The animated show is far more resilient than slothful anime screen play."
-egQ79OrYCs,@siriuslynow not zuko
-egQ79OrYCs,nice i can't wait
-egQ79OrYCs,It looks too serious. And everyone is white. wtf.
-egQ79OrYCs,looks pretty kewl ..im jus not gonna over expect incase it turns out wrong..but not underexpect either ^_^ looks pretty  awesome...especially the earthbending part
-egQ79OrYCs,BEST SAGA AFTER DBZ!!!! LUV IT!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MJCDreamart Yes M.Night is GREATLY sticking to the cartoon, but he is planning on make 3 movies one for each book and it will be difficult to put EVERYTHING in them so YES somethings will be left out. Appa IS in the movie as well as momo( if look closely they can be seen in the super bowl version of this trailer) ALOT of the characters from the show will be in the movie, but if there not in the book of water don't expect an appearance! (PS sony plans to start over FRESH with spiderman, NO 4!)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@OptimistismIsHard 
They made all the (main kid/teen) character older in the movies, Their age in the movies will be older than that of their cartoon counterparts~"
-egQ79OrYCs,"@FiaChan91 
Toph Doesn't even appear in the show till the second book 
(T_T; ) this movie is based of of the first book of water, so NO she will not be in it...maybe next movie, good luck, xD maybe they'll turn her into a boy in the movies lol~!"
-egQ79OrYCs,"haha wow, I actually think the way they did the tatoos are really sick. It's like they're real tatoos and the actual air bender logo is embedded in them. It's damn near impossible to get perfect lookalikes but I think M Night did a damn good job. Iro should be a tad more chubzor though =P"
-egQ79OrYCs,SOKKA!! <3333333
-egQ79OrYCs,They did aangs tatoos wrong as hell.
-egQ79OrYCs,the actors look fucken horrible! ..... M. Night is going to fuck up this story!
-egQ79OrYCs,Are you sure it's him? It kinda look like his tail though. I've always thought that they omitted Appa in the story.
-egQ79OrYCs,not much of a difference from the first trailer
-egQ79OrYCs,I hate those assholes at the racebending channel and website!! They're gay
-egQ79OrYCs,What the hell actors are you looking at? Because Jackson Rathbone is a god.
-egQ79OrYCs,The actors aree sooooooooooo fucking ugly
-egQ79OrYCs,How about Momo?
-egQ79OrYCs,this looks extremely promising..i cant wait :]
-egQ79OrYCs,woot for our big furry friend that is Appa XD
-egQ79OrYCs,Has anybody seen Appa?
-egQ79OrYCs,omg that looks so sick
-egQ79OrYCs,Why isnt he asian?
-egQ79OrYCs,"All I hope is that they have this movie Aang still be happy-go-lucky. Not all serious. 
Other than that I can't wait to see it! :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,Cool
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ok race wise, not accurate at all.
But visually and story wise......WOW.
At least Shamylananananana whats his 6th sense name is getting something right."
-egQ79OrYCs,I would loved the movie if it stayed in cartoons...there are some cartoonish funny things they cant do in real movies like this.....-_-
-egQ79OrYCs,"The characters should have been more true to the series but let's face it, this movie is made for Americans. Of course the casting is not the best it could be and I'm sure the studio execs picked the actors, not M.Night.  I'm sure if the studio wanted to be true to the series they would have picked ethnically diverse top young actors with martial arts background and elite fight choreographers. This is made for kids, they don't care about authenticity and the studio knows this."
-egQ79OrYCs,I think so. I heard there will be three movies. One for each book.
-egQ79OrYCs,Is this movie just based on the first part of the show (water)?
-egQ79OrYCs,"in the show virtually everyone! was east asian, i did not see one in this ad"
-egQ79OrYCs,Peter jackson ninja'd the movie name Avatar... that's so lame.. his movie sucked balls.
-egQ79OrYCs,"The cast is suppose to be Chinese, not Indians. Adaptation fail."
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie is gonna rock!
-egQ79OrYCs,Maybe because the casting is racist and the CGI isn't that groundbreaking anyway?
-egQ79OrYCs,"people are so judgemental, have they seen the movie?...if not, then why are they saying such negative things....watch it first then comment....stupid people...."
-egQ79OrYCs,"""Ohh! On no! It's M Night Shayamalan!""
""The Casting looks all wrong
""Leave this cartoon alone!!""

Who the hell cares? Now go fuck yourselves"
-egQ79OrYCs,"this would ne  much better than te dragonball movie

this stays in originol concept"
-egQ79OrYCs,Does anyone here know the name of the music that starts at 1:01?
-egQ79OrYCs,hope she is i love her to bits they better have a good actress for her!!
-egQ79OrYCs,sadly yes...i cant see him being funny at all...(no offence..hes so dense in twilight though)
-egQ79OrYCs,"Ahh...The Last Airbender movie made by M. Nightshitsalot, with wrong visual-casting and a pretty bad-looking storyline...coming out Summer 2010!??!! SWEET!!! I can't wait NOT to see it! :D"
-egQ79OrYCs,hm its just a roomer going around but maybe they ain't showing that cause they do have to cut a lot of things out of the movie since yea its a big series... but i really hope they add her into it all cause just then in the previews they showed mostly all the main characters besides zuko's sis and toph so it makes me wonder even more :(
-egQ79OrYCs,i hear there isn't going to be a toh (the blind earth bender) in this movie.... she is my favorite though *cry's*
-egQ79OrYCs,OMFG I LOVE the AVATaR(cartoon) SO MUCH AND SEEING THIS NEXT TRAILER I THINK I JUST JIZZED MYSELF HAHA kidding xD!
-egQ79OrYCs,"It doesn't matter that Dev Patel and Shaun Toub don't look like Zuko and Uncle Iroh. They will become those charaters because they are both excellent actors. After everyone sees this movie, Zuko and Iroh will look like Dev Patel and Shaun Toub."
-egQ79OrYCs,"With Hollywood's history...there is a possibility. Dragon Ball Z, Mortal Combat, Street Fighter...They have a talent for screwing up things that have cult followings"
-egQ79OrYCs,Fuck you
-egQ79OrYCs,"This is Shyamalan's first attempt at a blockbuster film. 

He better not fuck it up. It is Avatar after all!"
-egQ79OrYCs,OOOOOMMMMGGGG! I want to see that movie!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"Supposedly Yes it's a trilogy, but we know how trilogy's mainly go.

First one: Pretty good, new an exciting stuff.

Second: Copy pasta of first=snoozefest

Third: An Epic Makeup of the progression of all 3 movies combined, Ending in an ultimate (good or bad) Finale."
-egQ79OrYCs,look at the super bowl trailer. if u look in the top left corner at 10 seconds in you will see appa
-egQ79OrYCs,"It's there, at 1:04. It's just a less comic looking scar :)"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Jackson, Yay!"
-egQ79OrYCs,who are these unfamous actors
-egQ79OrYCs,"OK yea M. Night had a 3 last disappointing movies,but the other 3 before those were good, Signs,unbroken,and the sixth sense. but I'm sure he learned his lesson. I bet he will turn it all around with this one."
-egQ79OrYCs,is this based on the cartoon avatar?
-egQ79OrYCs,wheres zuko's scar
-egQ79OrYCs,greeaaatttt
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sarahiscool1 Unbreakable is also a really slow paced movie, and so is The Sixth Sense.  I loved both."
-egQ79OrYCs,indeeeed!!!!
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sarahiscool1 Ah I see. Well, to his credit he said the movie wasn't supposed to be a suspense thriller. It basically takes an old Chinese legend and modernizes it. He's definitely cornered himself into the 'suspense thriller' guy though. 

I liked it for personal reasons. I have children and a wife. I couldn imagine the pain of the main character as he went through the story. I could relate to him basically. The movie is rather slow, but I didn't mind because I wanted to see what happens."
-egQ79OrYCs,Well it's maked alot better than a bragon balls... :/
-egQ79OrYCs,"@MatoroIgnika You havent even seen it yet!! Wait to see it first, he's had a couple good ones!!"
-egQ79OrYCs,Optimus Prime? oO
-egQ79OrYCs,i swear if they kill this movie......****
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie looks good. It better be. If not I'm going to be mad.
-egQ79OrYCs,Where is Appa!!?? i hope they make him o.O..
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sarahiscool1 Don't mention The Happening! It hurts my ears!

What did you like about The Village and hate about Lady? I'm curious, I don't ask just to get into an argument."
-egQ79OrYCs,"Finally...... no confusion anymore with Avatar...and this. X.X so many people got confused cause of the other movie title 

Looks good. I am definitely gonna go and watch it."
-egQ79OrYCs,"The Avatar Franchise: 2005 - 2010

R.I.P.

Shyamalan is killing a great story."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@sarahiscool1 I liked it. And Lady in the Water. They both were small stories with a small group of people. Solid stories, and the movies didn't take themselves too serious. 

 I didn't like The Villagae though. He just tried too hard with the plot twist bullshit and it blew up in his face."
-egQ79OrYCs,I hope not.
-egQ79OrYCs,"@dragonslapp22 

FINALLY! someone who's got a brain. thanks for restoring my hope in humanity dude!"
-egQ79OrYCs,this movie will be the next Dragon Ball Evolution
-egQ79OrYCs,Kung fu is the new sell out. BOOOOOOOORING!
-egQ79OrYCs,"He doesn't need to put a twist in on this. He just needs to take the important material from the show and put it in. Take out the unneeded episodes where they make friends with a town and never see them again. Those you take out, and basically reenact the rest, with changes to the fights, but the same overview."
-egQ79OrYCs,Hopefully not.
-egQ79OrYCs,"Well, i like it. I know its not true to what skin tone people are in the show, but if you are gonna let somthing that simple ruin a movie experience, just seriously go fuck yourself with an iron stick."
-egQ79OrYCs,"@mvcatolico
You are right! In the series, Aang is a bit like a clown and he always makes jokes! He is NEVER serious! But this here......"
-egQ79OrYCs,"Its probably going to end up just like Dragon Ball ""Evolution"" did"
-egQ79OrYCs,"im definately gonna check this out, hopefully it turns out good"
-egQ79OrYCs,looks like Avatar O.o
-egQ79OrYCs,"never heard of the show,but this looks incredible.(ROLE THE CREDITS!XD)
seriously,definetly gonna watch this!:D"
-egQ79OrYCs,"for what i see...this movie only go to the part in the water tribe in the pole,a trilogy will fith better for a long history like this.i hope a trilogy...crappy english excuse me"
-egQ79OrYCs,YEAH!
-egQ79OrYCs,"cool, its a shame that they got white ppl playin Asians characters , but hay still gonna watch it"
-egQ79OrYCs,This movie looks awesome. i really hope it doesn't suck....Please don't suck movie!!
-egQ79OrYCs,Uh...I hope you weren't serious. This is just the first season.
-egQ79OrYCs,LOL YEAH!
-egQ79OrYCs,yep James Cameron's film have reserved this title since 1994 :D
-egQ79OrYCs,it's funny that theye couldn't call it avatar
-egQ79OrYCs,AWESOME!!! :D

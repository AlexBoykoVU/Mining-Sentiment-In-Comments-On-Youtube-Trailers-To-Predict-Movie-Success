7Pa_Weidt08,Going to see it on Saturday! HECK YE!
7Pa_Weidt08,"don't know why, but i loathe James Corden. I can't for the life of me figure out why he's popular, is it because he's british?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Boy is the Emoji Movie looking pretty entertaining right now!
7Pa_Weidt08,The critically and commercially panned Peter Rabbit! Oh boy!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,Mother of god this is a travesty
7Pa_Weidt08,What on earth have you done to Peter Rabbit? Are you dribbling idiots?
7Pa_Weidt08,Hey look it’s garfield 3
7Pa_Weidt08,"I saw this coming, poor Beatrix Potter must be turning in her grave :("
7Pa_Weidt08,Who allowed this!!!??????? HORRIFIC!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,γίνονται πραγματάκια
7Pa_Weidt08,How about no.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Stop putting modern music and jokes in everything. 

I cringed so hard I turned inside out."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I may be the only person but...I think it looks hilarious. Some of you are taking simple things (ie a silly movie) very seriously. True, it's not the stuff we were read to as kids but times are ever changing. Get used to not getting used to things 🤷🏽‍♀️"
7Pa_Weidt08,The movie industry is running out of ideas
7Pa_Weidt08,Headlights!
7Pa_Weidt08,And make a real movie of princess and the frog
7Pa_Weidt08,They should make a real movie of Zootopia
7Pa_Weidt08,The new Eight Crazy Nights looks good!
7Pa_Weidt08,saw a peter rabbit trailer before watching
7Pa_Weidt08,"They’ve basically f@!*ked a classic!!!
Well done Hollywood, hope you spend the money on making a movie where you don’t completely disrespect generations of childhoods!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"CANCEL THIS ABOMINATION. OMG.

This isn’t Peter Rabbit.... This is fake!! No...😭"
7Pa_Weidt08,"So angry..my rage is untethered and it knows no bounds, I will fall upon Hollywood like the crashing of a thousand waves!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,I think James Corden is stuck in a contract with Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,But is the narrator American?!!! It was a british auther called Beartrix Potter who wrote all the lovely Peter Rabit books
7Pa_Weidt08,"I like James Corden, but they should've chosen someone else. And this movie is coming after the sweetness of Paddington? Step your game up, Sony."
7Pa_Weidt08,"James's talent seems to be endless, just keeps amazing us more and more...."
7Pa_Weidt08,I don't think Sony Pictures gives any fucks at all.
7Pa_Weidt08,I'd rather see the Peter Rabbit character retired than live on as a generic modern snarky kid's comedy character.
7Pa_Weidt08,Nobody can think of any actual GOOD ideas from movies these days! My mom was just saying the same thing!
7Pa_Weidt08,#NotMyRabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,How does this have 4000 likes???!!!!! I was so looking forward to taking my son to watch gis 1st movie at the cinema now it will have to wait  what an abomibation! I want to keep his innocence as long as possible and not tardish it with whatever this is. So sad
7Pa_Weidt08,"0:04-1:45, AAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  What in God's name is that?!"
7Pa_Weidt08,IS NOTHING SACRED?!
7Pa_Weidt08,I don't know what's gonna be worse: this or Fifty Shades Freed?
7Pa_Weidt08,Why we can't have nice things
7Pa_Weidt08,A disgusting & appalling travesty. Anyone attached to this typical load of crap should be ashamed of themselves. Could have been a lovely film. Instead we'll once again have brain-washed children twerking out of theatres as the world continues it's downward plunge into idiocy.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is really sad. I know I used to watch peter rabbit as a child but I don’t remember much about it. All I remember is really soft almost water coloring-like animation, pretty scenes with soothing classical soundtracks. So when I found out they made a movie I was really excited to see what kind of nostalgic vibes it gave and hoped it would re jog my memory a little— but this is what I saw. Such a disappointment"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This looks like utter trash.  Am I alone in thinking that James Corden is one of the most unfunny people in ""entertainment"" right now?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well, at least Hollywood is still making movies"
7Pa_Weidt08,Wish they remove this trailer on T.V. ASAP
7Pa_Weidt08,Why do they make fun of the fact that Peter has no pants? None of them have pants.
7Pa_Weidt08,"if Margot Robbie is in it i'll fucking watch it anyway, No matter how bad or stupid 😍😍 God I Love that Lady"
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter rabbit gets thrown out the window and Sony takes over.
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is Hollywood so hell-bent on spoiling all my childhood memories just to make a cheap buck or two? :P
7Pa_Weidt08,"I’m Just Asking, Why Do People Hate This Movie so Much? Welp, I love THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!!! And I don’t Really understand.. I think Beatrix Potter Would Love It... But Showing Off Hate Is Rude... Just uh.. please Dont Show Off Hate...."
7Pa_Weidt08,Portugal. The Man? Why?
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh sweet christ no. NO. MAKE IT STOP.
7Pa_Weidt08,This makes me so sad. Why does everything need to be sassy and silly?
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony please stop making movies. Please?
7Pa_Weidt08,I officially have lost all respect for James Cordan and Sony as a whole.
7Pa_Weidt08,General Hux has fear of a Pig.
7Pa_Weidt08,Just discovered that this movie was being made about five minutes ago—tried to watch the trailer and actually failed. I could not get past the first 45 seconds. This is foul.
7Pa_Weidt08,That looks terrible.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Perhaps we can have Spectrum Pulse cover this film when it comes out, so he can tear it to shreds..."
7Pa_Weidt08,"This movie is gonna be a torturer methed one day.
Like the rabbits are being soooo mean to a guy just cus he dosent want them in his garden.
ANYONE WOLD BE MAD!!! Now for the rest of the comment, im just gonna put the finger.👎👎🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕😤🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕😐🔫🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕"
7Pa_Weidt08,howd general hux end up here after being like second head of command of the first order lmfao
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope you go bankrupt Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,At times like these I wish I could dislike a video 10 time
7Pa_Weidt08,What’s that background song called?
7Pa_Weidt08,Absolutely disgraceful! What would Beatrix Potter say if she saw this?
7Pa_Weidt08,No no no - This ain't Peter. This is a copy of the donkey from shrek.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Pathetic😡! As a new grandmother, I am quite proud of my daughter and son in law who refuse to subject my grandson to this garbage! He will grow up with the classic version of Peter Rabbit! Beatrix Potter IS turning over in her grave!"
7Pa_Weidt08,I grew up with the Beatrix Potter books... this hurts
7Pa_Weidt08,The nick Jr series has better writing than this.
7Pa_Weidt08,Did anybody see at 0:42 there's a no shirt fox and at 0:53  on the left there is a fox with a shirt?
7Pa_Weidt08,"I really loved Beatrix Potter books and films as a child. Please Sony, please please please please can you try to gain an understanding of why people watch films. Emotion, escapism, enlightenment, empathy there's important reasons for stories to exist in our society. They're not just a medium for cheap physical comedy, improvised one liners and whatever name you think will put the most zeroes in your bank account. You our stewards for our culture. You have a responsibility greater than making money. Act like it."
7Pa_Weidt08,how do i delete this video from the internet please youtube support
7Pa_Weidt08,Song?
7Pa_Weidt08,Smh
7Pa_Weidt08,Why...
7Pa_Weidt08,"This looks amazing! Just kidding, it looks absolutely horrible. What a disaster. That's not MY Peter Rabbit!"
7Pa_Weidt08,What’s going to happen next? is Sony going to do a live action adaptation of watership down with Adam Sandler and Kevin James?!?
7Pa_Weidt08,I feel like the bunny is the bad guy
7Pa_Weidt08,It's simply awful and disrespectful. Did Sony really believe this was good enough to spend $50 million USD on its budget? I definetely won't need this.
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm at work
7Pa_Weidt08,The only reason that I’m going to see this is only because Domnhall Gleeson is in it
7Pa_Weidt08,"ThIs SuMmEr, JaMEs CoRden is About tO FiNd Out, thAt RecycLIng a ClaSsic ChilDreNs BoOk ....IsnT aS eASY AS hE ThoUght"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This should be titled ""Peter Rabbit Grows Up to Be a Tw@t."""
7Pa_Weidt08,I seriously have never read any of the books as a child and I don't even know what are they about. Going to cinema just for Domhnall Gleeson.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Hotel Transylvania 3 will be far better than this, who agrees?"
7Pa_Weidt08,okay this movie so stupid
7Pa_Weidt08,"No thanks! The original Peter Rabbit stories were charming with interesting animals characters, this looks like a drunken frat party."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony just flushed my childhood down the toilet
7Pa_Weidt08,Feeel it still!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,Horus x
7Pa_Weidt08,"Guys, the film isn't actually bad. I was able to view a preview. It's got a decent story with good actors. Yes, it's nothing like the original, but still give it a chance."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Again, am I the only person who likes the look of the film?




Hello from the emoji movie trailer


Daisy xx"
7Pa_Weidt08,music?
7Pa_Weidt08,What’s the song? 0:33
7Pa_Weidt08,Approach this movie as it's own New story entirely or you will be disappointed if you try to compare it to the original story by Beatrix Potter
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter is writhing in her grave. It's a wonder they didn't make Peter black.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is their newest desperate attempt to make the new Alvin and the Chipmunks film without the chipmunks. They did the same thing with the Smurfs, so why not get the rights to a property that should *not* get this treatment?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"PIXAR: Our films can be enjoyed by both adults and children, because se can put very subtle emotional moments and deliver lessons in unique ways, and at the same time deliver some clever humour and crack funny jokes, knowing when it's time to stop and relax.

DISNEY: Hey, boys and girls! Want to live great adventures and follow the journey of brave knights and princesses, or watch how society would work if people were animals? We push the limits of creativity...sometimes. We just know how to please kids. By the way, remember our last 23 movies we are referencing in our latest picture?

DREAMWORKS: Um... bouncing things that make smiley faces are cool, we guess. Yes, we ARE working on an original idea, let us polish up Shrek 19: Ogredrive first.

SONY: LOOK, KIDS! THAT DUBSTEP SONG YOU ALWAY LISTEN ON THE RADIO THAT GOES ""OH, OH, OH!"" LOOK, FUNNY ANIMALS FARTING IN YOUR FACE! LISTEN, HE SAID A MEME! LAUGH, IT'S FUNNY! LAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHH!!! What, it stopped being relevant 12 seconds ago? WHO CARES! LAAAAAUGH!!! LOOK, IT'S A THING YOU FIND ON FACEBOOK, SO ITZ FUNNEH! Making a good adaptation of a cartoon or a book? LETS UPDATE IT FOR NO REAZUHN, DA OREEJEHNUL STORI IZ TOO BOHRING!!! HURPDURPWEREFUCKINGGENIUSES! MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!

BLUE SKY: (a barren frozen wasteland with Robots, Epic and The Peanuts buried under thousands of layers of ice)"
7Pa_Weidt08,Trailer is fantastic..who agree with me??
7Pa_Weidt08,WTF!!! O.o
7Pa_Weidt08,"Please forgive us, Beatrix Potter."
7Pa_Weidt08,Dohmnall is like...the best thing about the trailer.
7Pa_Weidt08,General Hux found the First Order life too stressful
7Pa_Weidt08,This is fairy tale.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Anyone complaining about Peter rabbit being rebellious obviously hasn’t read the story. The first thing he did when his mother told him not to go to Mr. McGregor‘s farm, was go there and squeeze under the gate. Then when he lost his clothes, instead of just letting himself be naked [like a normal rabbit] he went and stole them back. Peter rabbit was always a party animal, you just never knew it."
7Pa_Weidt08,Could someone give me some Bleach? Please don't show this movie to your rabbit.
7Pa_Weidt08,1:13
7Pa_Weidt08,What's the song??
7Pa_Weidt08,It's the guy off of Black Mirror!!!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,What's the song?
7Pa_Weidt08,I search Peter Rabbit just to see if tracks from this old CD I have are there and I find this.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Are you trying to get sold to Disney...cause you know you could just donate all the money used to make this movie to chairity...or burn in some bums oil drum, either way be more worthwhile"
7Pa_Weidt08,"is it weird that I don't hate this? I mean it's stupid but I don't really mind. The only thing I don't like is making farmer mcgregor a young guy. But I have read the tale of peter rabbit, and the tale of squirrel nutkin and every other tale by beatrix potter. the source material is something I take a lot of interest in and respect, but at the same time i'm really kind of amused at the idea of making peter rabbit into a 30 year old bloke who's clearly too old to be acting like a college fratboy. The idea... It has comedic potential, even if it's also got idiot potential, as this trailer has demonstrated. I am not disappointed, rather amused by this premise. Is anyone else with me? No?"
7Pa_Weidt08,1:13 rip my brain cells
7Pa_Weidt08,Why?
7Pa_Weidt08,日本版の予告はクソだなディズニーとか特に思う。
7Pa_Weidt08,this is the definition of furries right here
7Pa_Weidt08,How is this Peter rabbit?
7Pa_Weidt08,"This doesn't look great at all. Bad humor, please stop. The ONLY reason I watched this trailer was because Daisy Ridley is in this! To all the stars wars fans out there!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Song name?
7Pa_Weidt08,James Corden should of been stillborn
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope James Corden gets hit by a bus.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is gonna be good seeing General Hux  get owned by a bunch of animals 😂
7Pa_Weidt08,Song used in this video..well the ad of this movie  is called vampire weekend  just in case  u was wondering
7Pa_Weidt08,"I have two responses.  One towards the movie and one towards the comments here.
I am sad as anything that they have done this to Peter Rabbit and to Beatrix Potter.   It breaks my heart to tell you the truth.   It's pretty disgusting and terribly disrespectful towards the author and her beautiful literary works. 
I grew up with Beatrix Potter books.  I still have some.  And I have enjoyed reading the tales to my grandson.   I even don't mind the  animated movies by Nickelodeon.  They are quite nicely done.  
 I wouldn't be surprised that cinemas in England will boycott this crappy movie.   I just don't  think  They are going to take too kindly towards it.   Everyone over there  knows who Peter Rabbit and Beatrix Potter is.  And they aren't going to like this rubbish.  I am British myself and live in the States and I just gave that feeling it won't go down too well with the British audience. 
My second response is towards the thumbs down and majority of the comments made here. 
I am encouraged and so  relieved to see all the responses and how so many of us here are unified in our thoughts and feelings towards this travesty of a movie.   And it's great to know that there's plenty of people left who still have class and taste.  Thank you everyone."
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie is not of Netflix
7Pa_Weidt08,"My mom raised me and my sister on the Peter Rabbit books. The cartoons will always hold a special nostalgic place in my heart. They are some of thw most simple, down-to-Earth stories ever. And as an artist, I love the watercolor backgrounds that Beatrix Potter used, how realistic she made the animals look, and how she explored what lives they would have outside of the human's eye.

I showed this to my mom, she hates it too. May the Sony executives burn in hell. On behalf of all of us who grew up with your work, we're so sorry Ms. Potter."
7Pa_Weidt08,So this is a movie based off of a reboot based off a show?
7Pa_Weidt08,"man, the original book was like the core part of my life when i was 4-6 and i feel like its going to waste a bit."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why do you exist? To become the next Paddington, you wish SONNNYYYYYY!!!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,I haven't been a kid for a long time (and I'm assuming that's your target audience) but does this seem like pure garbage? I can't tell if I've become too cynical and jaded or this just looks genuinely bad.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oh my god this is ten billion quadrillion times worse than I thought it would be, and I knew it would be disgraceful. Please stop."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I Was hoping to write a children's book sometime in the future. I had a simple idea that I hoped to turn into a series if things go as planned. I don't really expect much to come out from this, other than possibly make a small difference in the world.

You know who else had that thought? Beatrix Potter; writer of the ""Peter Rabbit"" books. They were simple, subtle, straight to the point, used simple illustrations to get said points across; and most importantly, Potter was able to tell a story without insulting the reader's intelligence.

Sony Pictures then found a copy of one of the Peter Rabbit Books, and then proceeded to use the pages of the book as Toilet Paper, and this is what got flushed into Los Angeles City Septic Systems."
7Pa_Weidt08,This story is that the farmer tried to kill Peter not a bully smh 🤦‍♀️
7Pa_Weidt08,Song name
7Pa_Weidt08,"Terrible CGI...
Terrible plot...
Gay trailer music...
Horrible jokes...
Yep, this is Sony alright. When are they going ro learn?"
7Pa_Weidt08,so everything these days even based on a series of story's as innocent as peter rabbit has to have shitty toilet humour when adapted to the big screen to appeal to the masses there is no hope the animated series i watched as a kid in the 90's why couldn't they keep it faithful to that to beatrix potter's original works i would love to see that done with this live action cgi instead of modernising it into this crap i hope this flops
7Pa_Weidt08,I feel this movie will do terrible
7Pa_Weidt08,"I have 5 grandchildren I was going to take to see this, not now. They grew up on Beatrix Potter. What morons came up with this?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Wut is that song called
7Pa_Weidt08,Ug no!
7Pa_Weidt08,Is this Peter Rabbit or something else entirely?
7Pa_Weidt08,I swear to god if I see another fucking Peter rabbit add I'm going to fucking kill myself.
7Pa_Weidt08,"How to ruin childhoods: 
Make a shitty adaptation of a old book."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is why I lost all hope in humanity. Thanks sony
7Pa_Weidt08,"what the heck is this. Is I find you Sony, oh you will be having a bad time"
7Pa_Weidt08,Besides the movie. I love the song.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony why just why no one NO ONE asked for this at least make it good.please
7Pa_Weidt08,"No shoes.





0/10."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony change your username this is not entertainment
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ok, I know this sounds crazy but... What if Sony just wanted to make good movies instead of using film to make money? Can you imagine what all of their movies would look like if they actually cared about being good?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Awe the guy from Black mirror.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Hey everyone, the people who somehow enjoyed this trailer and decided to watch the second, while the rest of us didn't bother. As a result, the second trailer has an overly positive like to dislike ratio. We should all go to that trailer as well to spread the hate."
7Pa_Weidt08,"The beginning of the trailer makes it look like it may be following the source material before it went so downhill it may as well have jumped off a cliff. Sony is deliberately trying to force the fact that they are taking the source material and turning it into... this. Posters are even saying ""You think you know him? Think again!"". They aren't just ruining Peter Rabbit, they are taking pride in it's destruction and expecting us to as well. WHY?!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This movie is unnecessary and is probably the most cruelest thing to do to the source material. Now people are going to portray this thing that is just another uncreative, pop-cultured references, doesn't-have-anything-to-do-with-Peter-Rabbit as Peter Rabbit instead of the actual great, unique, and classical story with a good lesson.
Why can't movies original anymore?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Whats the song called
7Pa_Weidt08,"Peter Rabbit: The Movie. What better way to pay tribute to a children's 
classic than to make the characters hyperactive, reference-spewing 
disturbingly realistic monstrosities who inflict legitimately painful 
looking ""slapstick"" on a live-action human? Brilliant."
7Pa_Weidt08,The animation is awesome but..... just. No.
7Pa_Weidt08,"""AHHHHHHH"" ""Ahhhhhhhh"""
7Pa_Weidt08,Just noticed the dislikes
7Pa_Weidt08,I thought Oli White voiced Peter rabbit Lol
7Pa_Weidt08,"Right we want Peter Rabbit to sound like a smug, smarmy, unfunny, poor mans David Brent from Buckinghamshire. Someone get me James Corden!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Why couldn't aardman animations have made it? I hope it bombs
7Pa_Weidt08,"THEY KILLED PETTER RABBIT!! this is so fucking awfull, theres no respect for the origional source material!!!! They make peter sound like a gettho snob!!! and james corden is an awful choice for this!!!  Its like they made TED 4 only with a RABBIT!! you assholes!!! you killed him!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,That pigs laugh was so fake
7Pa_Weidt08,"as somebody who grew up with the books and the original shorts, this is so disrespectful to the source material. beatrix potter must be rolling in her grave!"
7Pa_Weidt08,You gotta admit. The texture and designs of the animals' animation look amazing.
7Pa_Weidt08,Yecccchhhh! Awful.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is basically hop 2 this is going to be bad wait for the reviews I will be surprised if this is good
7Pa_Weidt08,"Holy crap ! Daisy Ridley,James Cordon ,Margot Robbie,Domhall Gleeson and Sia in 1 movie!!!!! Who’s next? Jimmy Fallon,Jered Leto,Adam Driver and Daniel Reynold?"
7Pa_Weidt08,feel it steel
7Pa_Weidt08,STOP SONY Just STOP 😭 Your ruining my childhood
7Pa_Weidt08,whats that song thats playing in the background? Gonna drive me crazy?
7Pa_Weidt08,What is this travesty.
7Pa_Weidt08,Ugh.
7Pa_Weidt08,"and I'm here thinking that is how General Hux screams .. and now I am going to relate this scream to the General.. Kylo Ren scaring Hux and hears this XD 
ALSO
Sony please STOP!! PLEASE DON'T MAKE EVERY CHILDREN'S STORY HAVE A MODERN TWIST SOME ARE BEST WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY ARE"
7Pa_Weidt08,1:13 when they confirm a sequel to this movie
7Pa_Weidt08,What's the song?
7Pa_Weidt08,ugh.
7Pa_Weidt08,Hollywreck is a sewer SHUT IT DOWN AND GIVE THE LAND TO THE POOR
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why. Who on your creative team thought,  ""lets take an adored childhood story, and rather than redo it in classic animation true to its intent,  make it a bullshit slapstick POS that looks like trash.""

Fire everyone involved with this project."
7Pa_Weidt08,Omg but can we talk about Domhnall Gleeson with brown hair? GOD DANG
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm a big fan of Corden as a talk show host but seriously he needs to stop doing voice acting.
7Pa_Weidt08,Memelous
7Pa_Weidt08,Name of the song?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Just watch Furry Vengance, imagine this film but better and already made with Brendan Frasier."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Goodness gracious, I've never seen anything more unfaithful in my life. Even the Nick Jr. cartoon from a few years ago was closer to the source material than this. For shame, Sony."
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow this looks dreadful. Absolutely dreadful.
7Pa_Weidt08,Truly a disappointment. Hope Beatrix Potter didn’t see what they’d done to her masterpiece.
7Pa_Weidt08,.....The Nick Jr series was better
7Pa_Weidt08,"Yikes Domnhall, what are you doing?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Yeah....this movie will be terrible
7Pa_Weidt08,"I like James Corden but keep in mind.......

7Pa_Weidt08,What is the song in the trailer ?
7Pa_Weidt08,the movie look so terrible but visualy the fox is just fucked up WOW
7Pa_Weidt08,"it's funny how they scrapped a Popeye movie cause ""no one liked Popeye""  but i don't know ONE little kid who has heard of Peter Rabbit"
7Pa_Weidt08,Dont dislike OK
7Pa_Weidt08,Let’s roll! Bye Felicia!
7Pa_Weidt08,Can't wait to see General Hux try to kill a rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,"Since Sony has signed a contract with the devil and is indeed part of the illuminati, I'm not quite surprised they came up with this garbage. They took the sweet innocence out of the original Peter Rabbit. NOT happy about this."
7Pa_Weidt08,What happened to the traditional story line of Peter Rabbit.
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie lit
7Pa_Weidt08,Lol
7Pa_Weidt08,Here from memeulous
7Pa_Weidt08,What’s the song in the trailer called?
7Pa_Weidt08,What the hell Sony pictures animation you already did the smurfs now this . And I feel bad for the animators and artists I hope They can leave this worthless studio and come to disney and pixar the 2 the two giants Warner animation group DreamWorks illumination Studio Ghibli cartoon saloon and Aardman the giants of animation then Sony pictures animation the diesasterious Studio plus sony/Columbia their getting worse
7Pa_Weidt08,"From the creators of the greatest Disney movie of all time, The Emoji Movie, and the visionary director of Ice Age and Gnomeo and Juliet...Comes a film that reeks of Adam Sandler, Nine Lives and the Garfield Movie (the live action one)."
7Pa_Weidt08,Geez I didn't know Hux hated the wildlife so much
7Pa_Weidt08,I Know That People Disliked This Video I'm Not Going To Dislike You
7Pa_Weidt08,This is exactly what I was afraid Paddington was going to be... at least they didn’t both turn out like this.
7Pa_Weidt08,these comments are fucking hilarious. i hope they do the Velveteen Rabbit next.
7Pa_Weidt08,Who else came here to see the dislikes?
7Pa_Weidt08,Why isn't this animated?
7Pa_Weidt08,DANG JAMES GOT IT GOING WITH MOVIES NOW 👏🏼👏🏼
7Pa_Weidt08,The Emoji Movie All over again
7Pa_Weidt08,Wasn't the whole point of the book that Peter going to the farm was a terrible and dangerous idea that nearly got him killed?
7Pa_Weidt08,I prefer the tv show
7Pa_Weidt08,Absolute travesty. Beatrix Potter will be spinning in her grave. Kids are going to be really confused if they see this cinematic train wreck and then want to read the books.
7Pa_Weidt08,What’s the song in the background
7Pa_Weidt08,What is the name of the song they use in this trailer. Does anyone know?!
7Pa_Weidt08,"The First 13 seconds were nice and then...
Yyyeeeeeeaaaahh"
7Pa_Weidt08,this movie seems dumb but domhnall gleeson looks like a snack so I'll watch just for him
7Pa_Weidt08,This is bullshit.
7Pa_Weidt08,Song
7Pa_Weidt08,"Am I the only one who thinks this good, it’s supposed to be for kids, and I am a kid (10) and I am so excited and this is going to be the best movie, so if a kid likes it then it’s a good movie"
7Pa_Weidt08,What song is being used
7Pa_Weidt08,"I got cancer after watching this, what do I do? Help!"
7Pa_Weidt08,I saw this trailer immediately after seeing the Paddington 2 trailer.  It's shocking how one captures the spirit and feeling of a beloved childhood  character and the other butchers it by turning it into Alvin and the Chipmunks.
7Pa_Weidt08,"So, let's see...
Peter Rabbit adaptation,
Familiar plot,
Unlikable characters,
Fucking SONY,
Yeah, this movie's gonna suck..."
7Pa_Weidt08,"First, this is not Peter Rabbit. Second...James Corden? Really? Isn't Peter still a child? Third, just...why?"
7Pa_Weidt08,An insult like the tv series
7Pa_Weidt08,What's next are they going to ruin Max and Ruby too😂
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why must they always try to be ""hip and cool""? sigh"
7Pa_Weidt08,who else is going to see it just because of James Corden
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks Awful
7Pa_Weidt08,The origin story of Elmer Fudd.
7Pa_Weidt08,I think I like the Easter Bunny movie better......Remember the one that poops jellybeans and home girl ate it......
7Pa_Weidt08,You realise sony that Peter Rabbit is part of my childhood as a friendly kids book..... NOT THIS.... this.... is not the Peter Rabbit I know. Sony please stop destroying my childhood. Peter Rabbit is not a party animal.....
7Pa_Weidt08,"This seems too much like Paddington, but is very untrue to the spirit of the source material."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Can you fucking not, Sony?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, just, give up"
7Pa_Weidt08,Hot. Garbage.
7Pa_Weidt08,First The Emoji Movie and now THIS!? Shame on you Sony Pictures Animation.... SHAME!
7Pa_Weidt08,just some stupid insult to the real peter rabbit and for dumb grade ones.
7Pa_Weidt08,STOP DISLIKING IT!
7Pa_Weidt08,Well there goes my childhood.
7Pa_Weidt08,It's as if Sony executives saw Paddington (which was great) and took all the wrong notes...
7Pa_Weidt08,"This didn't have to be Peter Rabbit. It could have been literally anything else, a blank space. This trash is NOT Peter Rabbit."
7Pa_Weidt08,"i hope the sun expands and consumes this planet slowly, because we deserve it."
7Pa_Weidt08,"what's wrong with the movie? it seems fun! It's going  to make kids and grown ups learn about the character, maybe even look for it and read the book. it's shining a light on something almost all of you complaining haven't thought about in ages! Jesus, trying not to offend anyone in 2017...."
7Pa_Weidt08,How to completely ruin a wholesome children's character.
7Pa_Weidt08,No...no...no...God no...no...are you kidding me? no...
7Pa_Weidt08,I think Peter is a bit TOO old for 2018
7Pa_Weidt08,How is called this song plz
7Pa_Weidt08,I was so happy when a friends child aged 12 said the movie trailer kinda ruined her childhood favourite book. I thought i was just a grumpy oldy who didn't like the new generation stuff. Peter rabbit had so much charm and adorable childlike character!
7Pa_Weidt08,It looks very cute!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Yeah yeah. Ruin my childhood memories, why don't you"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oh dear, this is gonna be one of those ""HAHA AREN'T WE FUNNEH!!??"" movies, when it isn't funny at all, isn't it? Oh god, can we please stop making those horrible things."
7Pa_Weidt08,Song?
7Pa_Weidt08,After watchin' Riverdales last episode I feel so awkward when I hear dat song....
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter is spinning in her grave right now. Uuuuuggghhh!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks so fucking creepy as well
7Pa_Weidt08,Imagine what Beatrix Potter would have thought of this disgusting mess...
7Pa_Weidt08,HOW ABOUT NO.
7Pa_Weidt08,cute :-)<3
7Pa_Weidt08,"Song is Portugal. The Man - ""Feel It Still"" (Official Video)"
7Pa_Weidt08,"If you go to Beatrix Potter's grave, you'll hear her not only rolling in her grave, but clawing at her coffin, cursing and bashing her head in anger."
7Pa_Weidt08,I see Sony Animation is making high-art again.
7Pa_Weidt08,Whats the song called they used?
7Pa_Weidt08,"The only thing I liked in the trailer were the visuals effects. Otherwise, Sony trashed a good story."
7Pa_Weidt08,Thank God Miss Potter isn't alive to see this.
7Pa_Weidt08,All it takes to modernize something is to suck out the heart and soul and exploit it in HD.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony has been nothing but garbage these years. I hope they go bankrupt. I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to make The Emoji Movie 2.
7Pa_Weidt08,You could power Manhattan with a turbine hooked up to Beatrix Potter's grave right now.
7Pa_Weidt08,What is this this is not peter rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,"For those amongst us that grew up reading the beautiful tales of Peter Rabbit, Benjamin Bunny, and Nutkin, we can perhaps consider this movie terribly classless and antithesis to the delightfully gentle nature of the original tales. Yet, if this movie brings one new reader, especially a child, to the incredible stories Potter wrote, if it encourages just one person to pick up a book, this movie will have succeeded.

This trailer makes Peter Rabbit appear slightly sociopathic. Not convinced this will be good yet I'll see it, and review it."
7Pa_Weidt08,Pretty sure i've seen this movie..but with a raccoon and a tortoise...and a bear
7Pa_Weidt08,WHY DO PEOPLE HATE THIS THE FOX IS ADORABLE?!
7Pa_Weidt08,No
7Pa_Weidt08,"No, god no!"
7Pa_Weidt08,0:33 - Did...did Peter Rabbit just make it rain with fucking lettuce?
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter Rabbit made it rain lettuce. They put a stripper joke in a Peter Rabbit movie...
7Pa_Weidt08,who is the song ?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow, this looks so painfully unfunny."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Can""t wait to see this movie"
7Pa_Weidt08,"hold up hold up HOLD UP! you had an animation team THIS SKILLED at animating realistic rabbits......AND YOU DIDN'T DO WATERSHIP DOWN?????? NO no instead we get this. come on people! of all stories that deserve a nice reboot, its watership down. not this!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony why you do this? You've taken a classic story once again, skinned it brutally, put the fleshy mess onto James BLOODY CORDEN and told him to dance around for entertainment.

It is unsettling and macabre.
This has very little to do with the source material.
Disrespectful."
7Pa_Weidt08,Burn in fucking hell sony
7Pa_Weidt08,"no.... no..... literally ANY animation production would have done better at handling this than sony. they're going to butcher a childhood classic into a mess of fart jokes and weird references. peter rabbit wasn't a ballsy dude, he was a misbehaving brat who grew terrified as soon as he learned his lesson! wtf is this?? this story didn't NEED a movie. if it's going to get one, it deserves something as charming and beautifully done as the original. not this disgraceful mess."
7Pa_Weidt08,This triggers me! REEEEEEEEE!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,Why did they choose James Corden? Am I the only one who finds him really annoying?
7Pa_Weidt08,Love their fur ❤️
7Pa_Weidt08,"I don't even mind the modern setting or the de-aging of Farmer McGregor. Those could very well work. What doesn't work, however, is the transformation of innocent, gentle Peter Rabbit into a crass fratboy."
7Pa_Weidt08,The story seems EXTREMELY predictable and probably will be
7Pa_Weidt08,"2017: We got the Emoji Movie.
2018: We get Peter Rabbit with James Corden
Fucking end my life"
7Pa_Weidt08,"THIS MOVIE WAS MADE IN AUSTRALIA, AND I KNOW BECAUSE MY DAD HELPED FILM IT, I ALSO GOT TO GO ON THE SET WITH HIM!!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Ha! I will watch it when rated PG.
7Pa_Weidt08,This has gone waaaay to FAR!! I WOULD SUE THEM for ruining this. These stories had class and charm and all beautifull things. THIS is ruining the childhood perfection of the stories. CAN I SUE THEM? IS THERE APETTITION TO GET THIS OFF????
7Pa_Weidt08,"Love James Corden! Domhnall Gleeson was amazing in GOODBYE CHRISTPHER ROBIN, THE REVENANT, all the HARRY POTTER films (Bill Weasely), ANNA KARENINA, EX MACHINA... there's no role he can't master!"
7Pa_Weidt08,0:27 show me your war face!
7Pa_Weidt08,what a shameless pile of garbage.
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm not going to pretend I have a huge connection to the original tale but I don't really like the look of this.
7Pa_Weidt08,A another classic by Sony Pictures in the vein of Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Smurfs. (sarcasm)
7Pa_Weidt08,1:14 general hux is afraid of pigs?????
7Pa_Weidt08,peter the rabbit is James gorden
7Pa_Weidt08,You ruined one of my favourite books.
7Pa_Weidt08,"hopefully, it will be better than the Emoji Movie"
7Pa_Weidt08,Ok  The Peter Robert cartoon show  Is much better then this movie
7Pa_Weidt08,Jesus... The show that aired on Nick Jr did a better job at staying true to the source material than this movie! And half the characters they added weren't even in the original stories! I think... I only read the first book and I hear that there's more.
7Pa_Weidt08,My childhood just got raped
7Pa_Weidt08,You know you have messed up when the cBeeBies version is a more faithful adaptation.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw this trailer. As someone who grew up with Peter Rabbit, this just looks awful. And of course it's made by Sony. Guess they gotta keep up that track record of being terrible."
7Pa_Weidt08,"this is disgusting.

how do you take something so lovely and subtle and charming and turn it into this?

I truly don't understand."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is horrible. I hope Disney destroys Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,Aren't Margot Robbie and Daisy Ridley supposed to be in this movie? Where are they?
7Pa_Weidt08,"It was you I knew it how are you so good to see you.
Peter he tried to kill U.its not like him
11 yrs old here"
7Pa_Weidt08,Anyone else still recovering from Emoji Movie?
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter is rolling in her grave.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Nothing quaint, charming or idyllic about this at all.... :(So sick of the same old formula in family movies now."
7Pa_Weidt08,#NOTMYPETERRABBIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,You suck.
7Pa_Weidt08,"In the original Peter Rabbit story, he's just a little boy and he gets into trouble because he wanted some treats and he lost his clothes. I think this is a terrible idea, and I'm going to read the story instead"
7Pa_Weidt08,UmI'm sorry but he looks like the bunny from HOP
7Pa_Weidt08,whats the backround song's name?
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter rabbit committing physical assault. wow.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Dear Sony,Please don’t do this. First the Emoji movie, now this. Not only are you making terrible movies, you are also ruining the experience of childhood for your younger demographic. This was my FAVORITE book growing up. You’ve gone too far. Peter was a love able character, and now he’s just a cash cow. Shame on you Sony, shame on you."
7Pa_Weidt08,my mom will be so excited
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter is rolling in her grave.
7Pa_Weidt08,When Sony didn't learn after the Easter bunny movie
7Pa_Weidt08,Welp there goes another remaining bit of my childhood
7Pa_Weidt08,Plz just do the Popeye Movie... 😥
7Pa_Weidt08,What’s the name of the song someone plz tell me
7Pa_Weidt08,This is not the peter rabbit i know and love
7Pa_Weidt08,0:27 childhood flashbacks
7Pa_Weidt08,I dont know anything about the source material this thing is based on. But it looks fucking retarded either way.
7Pa_Weidt08,Hey can anyone tell me what this song is called?
7Pa_Weidt08,Is this just Alvin and the Chipmunks with different animals?
7Pa_Weidt08,More dislikes!!
7Pa_Weidt08,"The original peter rabbit is childish, poetic, lovely and calm. If you have childrens, show them the original. I dont know why they do that, I dont know why they all want to make ""super cool and funny lol"" characters in children's movie or cartoon. it's sad (stupid) and not sure its really good for childs"
7Pa_Weidt08,wtf did they do to peter rabbit!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,"I have never read the Beatrix Potter books, but even i was thinking, before even looking at the comments or like/dislike ratio that -'Hang on - is this how Peter rabbit is supposed to be? I don't like this interpretation of the probably different character, maybe it's the jacket but he just seems too suave and obnoxious to be likable.'

And then there's the young character who seems to PERFECTLY fits the cliche secondary character in these live action CGI cute animal movies - young, sighing in a suit (more or less) so he must be struggling with a job, and awkward when it comes to seeing these animals are real due to the prolonged screaming. Hmm... where have we seen that before? Hop? The Smurfs? Alvin and the Chipmunks? On the off chance that Sony are trying to create a brilliant film, they should first check the reviews of those which it is trying so desperately to rip off. How much do you want to bet that this young guy also has a girl he's trying to woo and that she'll only decide to fall in love with him when she sees this cute, CGI talking rabbit?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Does anyone know that music? Now I'm attracted to it even though I hear it all the time
7Pa_Weidt08,trailer 2 made this get interesting
7Pa_Weidt08,Sure it's different than the original but it looks fun!
7Pa_Weidt08,hello furries!
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter is rolling in her grave
7Pa_Weidt08,What name of song
7Pa_Weidt08,If you listen closely you can hear Beatrix Potter rolling in her grave.
7Pa_Weidt08,name of the song ?
7Pa_Weidt08,name of the song ?
7Pa_Weidt08,name of the song ?
7Pa_Weidt08,first food fight then emoji movie and now this!?
7Pa_Weidt08,Jack Frost and hop  made this movie
7Pa_Weidt08,"Shall we go over the list of problems wrong with this?
I'll go first. 1.Peter is a kid..not some teenage asshole."
7Pa_Weidt08,Song ????
7Pa_Weidt08,1:16 Aaahhh horribly cgied pig!
7Pa_Weidt08,"There's a CBeebies adaptation of Peter Rabbit that I used to think was absolutely terrible... Suddenly, I don't think it's terrible anymore. ^_^"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Movies from eighties, like ""Neverending Story"", ""Gremlins"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" are obsolete crap. That movie show us how CGI wis highly developed. Since ""Jurrasic Park"" times CGI become very advanced. I can imagine ""Rescue Rangers"" made same method. Disney is big and very wealthy studio; they sure have tools to made hybrid movies (live action & CGI)."
7Pa_Weidt08,1:15 when i realize i have homework and left it at home on a vaction to hawaii
7Pa_Weidt08,Magregger is a farmer
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter would be dissapointed.
7Pa_Weidt08,I reckon this is going to be great. A different take on the story. Peter Rabbit as a rebel!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow, why don't they just squat over Beatrix Potter's grave and drop sh$t all over it."
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope people at least see the original series - it's on YouTube and everything. It was and still is one of the best adaptations of a story that I have seen...
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ah yes..the live action/CGI mix up...When has this worked?.. FUCKING NEVER, SO STOP DOING IT!!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Are you going to see it?  I hear Paddington 2 is good.
7Pa_Weidt08,This ain't Peter. This is Adam Sandler as a rabbit.
7Pa_Weidt08,im in school right now
7Pa_Weidt08,Is that Sia's Voice in the song?
7Pa_Weidt08,Sia as Mrs.Tiggy Winkle.
7Pa_Weidt08,where the H*LL did those 2 Thousand Likes come from?!?
7Pa_Weidt08,"""Oh I'm rebel just for kicking"" I think I've heard that before I don't but I can feel it still"
7Pa_Weidt08,"If you thought The Emoji Movie was bad, this will likely be way worse. I mean, The Emoji Movie is one of my guilty pleasures."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I was over the moon when they announced this, then I saw James Corden was voicing Peter."
7Pa_Weidt08,Whatever about people saying they wouldn't like to be (x bad person) when they meet their maker- I wouldn't like to be James Corden or Domhnall Gleeson meeting Beatrix Potter in the afterlife...
7Pa_Weidt08,"Will people stop freakin changing the whole point, pace and atmosphere of classic children's books/cartoons??! Postman Pat, Dennis the Menace, ANY Dr Seuss film adaptation!! ugh 😠 These big corporation people, modern children's authors, tv producers, guys- come on!!!!!! These stories became popular in the first place for a reason and kids are the freaking same as they always have been! They'll enjoy whatever you put in front of them, it doesn't need to be loud and rowdy and super fast paced. And for goodness sake LEAVE OUT the adult-pandering innuendos (of these things in general, idk if there'll be any in this) 😡 Any adult watching this film has signed up to watch a kids film, let them deal with it. And Parents, the consumers driving all this lark- stop buying into this garbage! You want to push these hyperactive children on yourself? Good luck, but I can't think of anyone who will thank you for it. Show your kids nice things and raise them gentle. 😑 
Edit: I'd mentioned Paddington here but that one is actually true to the concept and everyone apparently loves it x]"
7Pa_Weidt08,Having no pants is not a bad thing. It is not a bad thing to see the parts now and then that are not covered.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I Really Know It Sony Started Making Worst Movies Since The Emoji Movie.

We Need Sony To Go Bankrupt, And Let Sony Died."
7Pa_Weidt08,SONY DOES IT AGAIN BABYYYYYYYYYYYYY
7Pa_Weidt08,just saw the trailer on facebook me and my mom were laughing
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie ruined james corden's film career
7Pa_Weidt08,Ok i was gonna see this just because of how bad it looks but when the dear went iz loight i officially am not
7Pa_Weidt08,"Way to take a nostalgic children's character, total miss the point and tone of the source material and turn it into yet another generic animated comedy. The whole trailer has ""seen it before"" written all over it. If this film is exactly like what this trailer makes it out to be, then im sorry, I will not be seeing this film. Parents and movie goers! Please stop this trend in animated kids films. You have the power to make a change. Show studios this is not what we want by not giving them your hard earned money."
7Pa_Weidt08,Why are they making another Alvin and the Chipmunks movie?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Just like the rebooted Ghostbusters movie I won't ever watch this one either. I also agree with everyone else's hate for this film, with an additional comment about usin' the frickin' stock audio of the bloody cat yelpin'.

STOP USIN' CHEESY AND/OR OLD STOCK AUDIO."
7Pa_Weidt08,At least it looks better than Sherlock gnomes
7Pa_Weidt08,"Are Beatrix Potter's works public domain or something? I really cannot imagine her estate signing off on this. And if they did, someone should be *very* ashamed of themselves. (just compare and contrast this film with _The Peanuts Movie_ from 2015, which was made with love and respect for the source material).
Can Sony Pictures just go bust and die already? Jeez. How many flops does it take?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why is mr tod nice to Peter rabbit in the movie , mr tod is a villain not some nice guy come on !!!!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,I have to say the movie is not the same to the cartons
7Pa_Weidt08,When are the Peter rabbit episode coming out
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow, some real tactless pricks shat this one out."
7Pa_Weidt08,Im going to hate this movie!
7Pa_Weidt08,are you guys seriously getting all your panties in a bunch over.. a children's movie? geez
7Pa_Weidt08,"I remember Peter Rabbit as this cute charming thing. He was fun and engaging.   This is not Peter Rabbit. Its like they made their own new characters and stuck the wrong names on them all. So sad. The moment I saw 'Sony Pictures' I knew this would not be the best, but this is far worse looking than I imagined. The music chosen for this is a terrible choice for what should be a sweet classic, the choice of shots tells a story I don't want to see and the voice over was an immediate turn off too."
7Pa_Weidt08,This isn't the real Peter Rabbit. This is like... Peter Rabbit according to Shrek or something.
7Pa_Weidt08,Watership Down remake looking great I see
7Pa_Weidt08,Who came from the song feel it still
7Pa_Weidt08,Love it!!
7Pa_Weidt08,You destroyed my childhood -____-
7Pa_Weidt08,Over The Hedge 2
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why.. why did you do Peter Rabbit like this.. from what I remember Peter Rabbit was an innocent and a shy rabbit. Not a loud party maniac.. I will not watch this, until someone recreates this into something better and accurate."
7Pa_Weidt08,Screaming goat (old m3me)
7Pa_Weidt08,General Hux. Why?
7Pa_Weidt08,ahh.. sony movies..always get leaked..
7Pa_Weidt08,I found the sound that this trailer used fell it still
7Pa_Weidt08,The screaming part sounded like the goat from the Geico commercial.
7Pa_Weidt08,Okay am I the only one who liked this?
7Pa_Weidt08,NOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is disgraceful, everyone involved with this should feel ashamed."
7Pa_Weidt08,Guess General Hux left the First Order
7Pa_Weidt08,What. The. Hell.
7Pa_Weidt08,My childhood is ruined.
7Pa_Weidt08,Is this an 18 or something?
7Pa_Weidt08,We are certainly not tired of Americans exploiting James Corden for money off us Brits. Fucking scandalous.
7Pa_Weidt08,Paddington is so much better.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Leave it to Sony to wipe their butts with our favorite franchises, and then just throw it in our face. The only reason Spider-Man was semi decent this year I give the credit to Marvel for."
7Pa_Weidt08,Way to ruin a perfectly nice story.
7Pa_Weidt08,"""It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror! Horror has a face, and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies."" — Apocalypse Now"
7Pa_Weidt08,what's the title of the song?
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh poor Beatrix Potter what have they done to you!?
7Pa_Weidt08,Who else came from SlackWyrm?
7Pa_Weidt08,"I could not watch much of this trailer.

It was just to jarring.

Peter is not a discount version of Donkey from Shrek. Yes he is somewhat mischievous but not in this Flamboyant over the top way.

The voice acting of ""Peter Rabbit"" and the background music was just not in keeping with the source material at all.

If the trailer is reflective of the film I would suggest Sony send it back for a major rework and shift in tone. 

If you can't make this sort of film with the same sensitivity and heart shown by Don Bluth when he made The Secret of NIMH and other animated master pieces, just don't.

It does not have to be Watership Down, It is not, but both the Fox and Mr McGregor  should represent a mortal danger to Peter."
7Pa_Weidt08,"so basically you're telling m I'm not gonna like any of your movies from this point on, Sony?"
7Pa_Weidt08,This trailer made me roll in my grave and I haven’t even died yet.
7Pa_Weidt08,"""There lived a rabbit, named Peter, who wears a blue jacket........ and no pants""

Let's play a game: What rating do you think this movie will get on Rotten Tomatoes? Will they be ""better"" or worst then the current score for the Emoji Movie."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I literally grew up with Peter Rabbit! I’ve read the books, I’ve watched the 90’s series, I’ve watched the Nick Jr. TV series, I’ve bought all the merchandise of him at Barnes ‘N’ Noble, and I’ve even had a custom-made stuffed Peter Rabbit lie in my room for 8 years! And the plot for this movie just defines the very existence of live-action remakes. First the smurfs, and now this! WTH Sony?! I’ll still see the movie though. Besides, this is only a teaser."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oh look, another terrible movie that'll be ripped apart by Moviebob, The Nostalgia Critic, and The Cinema Snob."
7Pa_Weidt08,It's great why people hate it
7Pa_Weidt08,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but even Alvin and the Chipmunks was less obnoxious."
7Pa_Weidt08,The Emoji Movie was stupid in every way. This on the other hand is insulting both to the source material and to anyone who grew up with it.
7Pa_Weidt08,The horror! THE HORROR!
7Pa_Weidt08,I came from a comic in insta
7Pa_Weidt08,Just no.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This non cannon to peter rabbit universe, this is true torture porn at its finest."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ah yes, that classic Beatrix Potter novel in which Peter Rabbit throws a house party and goes all Wolf on Wall Street with lettuce leaves. This has honestly shocked me so much - even the music choice... they've turned a clam, mellow, warm character into some annoying, crazy party animal. Can't believe this."
7Pa_Weidt08,What is the name of the song???
7Pa_Weidt08,How is Sony pictures animation not bankrupt?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why would they do this?  Why couldn't it just be a happy nature child friendly movie?  I don't like bashing movies but This is terrible ,  I don't like it at all what they have done to it,  it's horrible,  and should be cancelled,  they ruin everything they just need to stop."
7Pa_Weidt08,whats so bad about this? i like it
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oy vey, Sony!
The animation looks good at least."
7Pa_Weidt08,we gon be poppin the biggest bottles when this flops and sony goes bankrupt my dudes
7Pa_Weidt08,"Butchered it and when it was dead, Sony kept stabbing it and then they crapped on it."
7Pa_Weidt08,This film is going to be a flop. I can tell.
7Pa_Weidt08,beautiful back ground song，I find this because of it
7Pa_Weidt08,what is music that there using?
7Pa_Weidt08,"(Beginning of Trailer): This looks promising 🙂

(17 seconds in): shots self in the head!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Nows the part where everyone complains about how bad the movie is after only seeing a 2 minute trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, if your movie doesn't work out well, you could always make a cross-over sequel between this pop-culture dance-number Peter Rabbit and your new Ghost Busters movie.  But with tons more cliche's, longer moments of characters screaming in surprise at each other, and more pop culture references.  I assure you this will in no way ruin your company..."
7Pa_Weidt08,4K Dislikes?
7Pa_Weidt08,Looks like we found new fodder for the Nostalgia Critic...
7Pa_Weidt08,This is like watching an actor dress up in my dead dads cloths and walk around the house pretending to be him.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is the most generic modern family movie I've ever seen.
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie is based on a book
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is SPECTACULAR !!!
😁👍😍😻😎🕶👌🤘"
7Pa_Weidt08,take the first 10 seconds or so and cut out the rest. then make the rest of the movie like the first ten seconds instead of whatever else that was. you can have a good movie now.
7Pa_Weidt08,Did anyone else here that cow? WHY TF IS THERE A COW WHEN THE STORY TAKES PLACE IN THE WOODS
7Pa_Weidt08,"A movie about me, neat"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Peter makes it rain with lettuce, attends a house party (in which Mrs Tiggywinkle makes a rather inappropriate comment about the state of Mr Foxes wellbeing, while Squirrel Nutkin is passed out behind them) and Peter is described as ""not wearing any pants"" (In the UK pants mean underwear) This is NOT Peter Rabbit. By all means, make another generic animal party romp  film but just don't touch Peter Rabbit!! If you really want to modernise a classic look at Paddington which gets it (mostly) right as a kids film.  

Sorry to be a snob but these books were what my Mum used to read to me when is was feeling sad or anxious as a kid. I know it's a sob story but the world of Beatrix Potter is FAR from anything in this film."
7Pa_Weidt08,"yes, give Peter Rabbit, THE CHILD RABBIT, a fully grown man's voice."
7Pa_Weidt08,Good trailer. #PeterRabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,This literally has nothing to do with Peter Rabbit... What in god's name.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is awful.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well this looks crappy af
Whats the song tho"
7Pa_Weidt08,"i'm very glad to see the dislike bar. it's good that everyone on youtube can see this for what it is, on facebook everyone was acting excited for it smh"
7Pa_Weidt08,"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BREAK EVERYTHING, HOLLYWOOD? WHYYYYYYYYY
Lovely, low-key, wonderfully written, completely classic story with a good moral? Let's turn it into a CG movie about a gang of animals breaking into a house to destroy it with a house party! AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope this bankrupts you, Sony!"
7Pa_Weidt08,SONY!!!! R U TRYING TO KILL UR STUDIO. R U TRYING TO GO BACK TO THE SMURFS ROOTS.
7Pa_Weidt08,"usa needs to buy back columbia pictures from Japan, because they are killing it"
7Pa_Weidt08,"What is this. Whyyyy. Peter Rabbit isn't a loud-mouthed prat. Beatrix Potter's animals don't ""PAR-TAY"". This doesn't work as a comedy either, because the jokes are painfully unfunny. Let me guess, there'll be poop and fart jokes in this, and maybe a few inappropriate sexual references to keep things interesting for the parents wishing they'd never let their children pick which movie to watch. For shame."
7Pa_Weidt08,Really ?? 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😓😒😒😒😒
7Pa_Weidt08,Love it
7Pa_Weidt08,"Dammit Sony! You're taking a dump on a beloved children's story and setting it on fire!

I thought you learned from your mistakes with Pixels, Ghostbusters, and the Emoji Movie...

Wait"
7Pa_Weidt08,What is the song calked?😕
7Pa_Weidt08,Not as good as a book
7Pa_Weidt08,James Corden is not a very nice person..
7Pa_Weidt08,british zootopia looks hella creepy
7Pa_Weidt08,this means time of peace and innocence  is over . time of chaos and mayhem has arrived go peter go  this world  choose  lie over truth  give the mother fuckers what they deserve
7Pa_Weidt08,AHHH!!
7Pa_Weidt08,I know there will be a large disagreement with me saying this but I'm excited for this movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Catch you on the flip side, dude-meisters! NOT! Hey kids, always recycle... to the extreme! Bust it!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Corporate necrophilia at its worst. Most of Sony’s stuff is just pre-hip trash turned to post-hip trash, but this? Pure fantastical naivete ground up and spoiled by Sony’s complete lack of artistic discretion, restraint, and class. My rainhat comes off to StudioCanal for doing Paddington as faithfully as they did, if this travesty is any indication of what could have been."
7Pa_Weidt08,"First time seeing this trailer in theater, I smiled because hey, it's good way to introduce a classic to younger generation. Then the Sony logo appeared. ""Oh no.."" I thought. Then Peter's voice sounded familiar. I thought to myself, please not be who I'm thinking of. After some cringey party scene, James Corden as Peter Rabbit. ""Oh god, it's that carpool karaoke guy!"""
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony has ruined- Ghostbusters, Jumanji, Annie, and now Peter Rabbit."
7Pa_Weidt08,The Nick Jr show looks like Beauty and the Beast compared to this!
7Pa_Weidt08,This is a bastardization of the source material
7Pa_Weidt08,Heya pal! ! ! Dumbass section Video really looks like deeply f|nnydiminish  :<
7Pa_Weidt08,i HATE this
7Pa_Weidt08,No.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is looking very good movie i have ever seen
7Pa_Weidt08,why the hate?
7Pa_Weidt08,Domhnall with dark hair...be still my heart. 💜
7Pa_Weidt08,This is bad and everyone working at Sony Pictures should feel bad.
7Pa_Weidt08,"The Emoji Movie: I'm the worst Sony movie ever!
Peter Rabbit: Hold my beer"
7Pa_Weidt08,I’d rather watch the cartoon.
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow! Just look at that dislike bar *click*
7Pa_Weidt08,Y tho
7Pa_Weidt08,That was also a show on Nick Jr.
7Pa_Weidt08,You have seen the fox rabbit movie that everybody liked....now watch the fox rabbit movie that will give you nightmares
7Pa_Weidt08,Lmao Sony is probably just going to start disabling comments like apple
7Pa_Weidt08,Please just go see Isle of Dogs. Save your money for an actually good and thought out film.
7Pa_Weidt08,:P
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm ready to fucking murder Sony! They're ruining a well beloved classic children's book!
7Pa_Weidt08,This makes me so sad :(
7Pa_Weidt08,"Talk about stabbing an author in the back (even though Potter has been dead for several years). This is horrible, in every single way possible! This is the first trailer that actually made me angry for real. I usually don't get angry over trailers so much, but this one was the last draw!

How DARE THEY make Potters characters and her whole world like this?! I grew up with her stories, the drawings, the characters and this is not what she probably had in mind.

Please, please, please, PLEASE I'm begging you parents around the globe, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!! This is crap!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Amo a Sony mas tá um lixo os filmes.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is nothing like Peter Rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oh god...sony did it again...

Ehhhhhhhhhhh"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Look at all those dislikes. Sony Pictures you sick fucks, what have you done?!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This sucks. First there was a CGI TV Series, Now this? I give this 2 out of 10"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ladies and gentlemen, there is only one way to make this despicable piece of filth flop even before it comes out. And that is to...give it no attention what so ever. The lesser it's known, the less money it'll make. So if you accidentally found yourself on this page, DO NOT come back and DON'T tell anyone about this movie, otherwise they'll check it too and the views will just go up, increasing more people to watch the movie. Thanks for reading, and good luck."
7Pa_Weidt08,"First Ghostbusters, then the emoji movie NOW PETER RABBIT?!?

Wow.... Sony is going to go into bankruptcy with in just a few years I can see it now...."
7Pa_Weidt08,"*_Mm._* You know, it's not hard to see how bad this movie is going to be on its own, but you managed to kill this beloved children's character in five words: _""James Corden is Peter Rabbit""._ That takes talent. I mean, _bravo,_ gentlemen... but hey, I'll credit you on this: if I want to watch infinitely more interesting tales starring Peter Rabbit than this horrid abomination and absolute butchering of a classic tale, I need look no further than the sidebar of recommended videos for a good dozen or so examples! Please, just... fucking stop."
7Pa_Weidt08,Fucking hate James Corden
7Pa_Weidt08,"Only disliked because the movie doesn't look that good, looks like alvin an the chipmunks 3"
7Pa_Weidt08,Poor Sony :( you are not giving freedom control to the directors any of them . That’s way your movies are so bad :( baby driver was good you are definitely doing everything good including tv shaws except movies
7Pa_Weidt08,"Even the Tetris movie is going to be better than this. Is my kids ask to go see it, I'm going to lie and say its for adults only due to extreme violence"
7Pa_Weidt08,9-10 seconds is how long that screaming gag lasted.....
7Pa_Weidt08,Stop trying to make James Corden happen.
7Pa_Weidt08,Bad
7Pa_Weidt08,God damnit sony
7Pa_Weidt08,"This, this right here is the death of art. It is an insult to Beatrix Potter, an insult to the fans of the books and it's an insult to children everywhere that Sony seriously believe children simply aren't worth the effort. This is disgusting and everyone involved should hang their heads in shame."
7Pa_Weidt08,Was the song that they played called
7Pa_Weidt08,The only genuinly good thing about the modern take is the Deer freezing at the lights... EVERY THING ELSE IS FUCKING AWFUL
7Pa_Weidt08,they can't do this right?
7Pa_Weidt08,First the cartoon and now this piece of crap! Not everything needs to be redone.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Instead of growing up with Beatrix Potter's beloved children's classic, today's youth will be subjected to this dunghill of tepid unoriginality. Thanks Sony Pictures Animation."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Peter Rabbit derp dee derp! Derpy derpity derpy derp! Until one day, a derpa derpa derpa derp! Derp dee do ta teedly tum! Peter Rabbit is Da Derp Dee Derp Ta Teedly Derpee Derpee Dumb!
Rated PG-13."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Yikes, first The Emoji Movie and now this. Not the best year for James Corden..."
7Pa_Weidt08,"really disapointed, i love sony pictures...and the characters look great, but what have you done to the story? i really hate the direction the movie industry has moved in."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony Pictures, do us a favor and keep making these movies, that way you go out of business and have to sell back all your marvel properties back to Marvel and then we can have Doctor Doom in the Marvel Universe"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Thanks for ruining the only good memory I have of my father , Sony."
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter Rabbit will end up being a secondary character in his own movie
7Pa_Weidt08,What? Sony making a movie that pretty much shits all over the beloved thing it's based off? I AM SO SHOCKED.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ha, ha!  I love it.  Reminds me of Hop.  Unfortunately, I don't see any other positive comments on this page.  I like this type of movie.  I was watching Garfield 2:  A Tail of Two Kitties last night."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I thought this was going to be beautiful. Turns out I was wrong. Why can't James Cordan do more serious acting? That way, he will be more likeable as a performer. I'm disappointed. I really am."
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm not even familiar with Peter Rabbit. Yet... I still feel a part of my childhood has died somehow!
7Pa_Weidt08,"What a waste, of absolutely everything.  I was fine until Peter frickin' MOWED through the clump of birds.

I'll get the least concern out of the way: The way MacGregor is portrayed here, is a tragic waste of Domhnall Gleeson's immense talent. He's been in a few stinkers over the last handful of years (the films were stinkers, not his performance), and this is no way to improve upon it. He didn't really convince me that MacGregor was all too frightened of the pig, even for all of that screeching he did.  He's usually a much better actor than this, and I'm sad he's been so cheapened.

Next: Peter Rabbit as a whole is supposed to be simplistic, gentle, charming, and quiet.  WHAT. IS. THIS?!  To start, the music is all... gangster'd out and loud, and reminds me of Sing! and the Peanuts Movie trailer and the end of Magic Mike XXL.  They did this to Alvin & the Chipmunks and Paddington as well, but at least with Alvin it sort of worked because they were hip and 2 cool 4 school to begin with.  This complete ""crassification"" of such a pure and gentle atmosphere as Peter Rabbit is known for... shudder!

And the biggest: I'm completely NOT cool with Peter's ""make it rain"" thuggish attitude!!  It's great if some of you think it's funny or an improvement, but I maintain that that is NOT MY PETER RABBIT.  MY Peter is cute and delicate and curious, not rude and loud and a party boy.  I'm so terribly sad at how many reboots have fallen victim to this... complete bastardization and stripping of integrity.  The Powerpuff Girls twerking, the Ghostbust-ette's with their frenetic SNL-style gross-out humor that fell flat, the aforementioned Paddington and Alvin being butchered... I'm sure there are so many others... But MY GOODNESS, can't anything that came before the ""cool"" era just be left on its own and be ""reintroduced"" to today's younger generation without destroying the HEART of the thing?  It is a total affront to Beatrix Potter's ART and VISION that this thing even exists the way it does.  Showing Peter Rabbit to the children of NOW is perfectly fine, and it's a great idea to make a brand-new movie to do so... but not like this.  Never like this.

I hope this movie tanks."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I remember my mom joined a Beatrix Potter reading club that me and my sister went to for several months. We bought the complete collection of Beatrix Potter stories and we were able to develop a real appreciation for those charming, innocent stories at a very young age. I even remember seeing some rather nicely made animated adaptations when I was a kid. This... feels like a betrayal. Not the fact that the movie is being made, unfortunately that was just kind of a given when the copyright protection ran out. Rather just the fact that instead of expanding the story but keeping the tone and charm of the original, they instead are making it yet another throw-away, unmemorable, instantly dated, trying-too-hard piece of animated wasted potential. If Blue Sky can make a Peanuts movie and do a masterful job bringing that to life, Sony should have been able to do the same here."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Hey SPA is not producing the movie. On Wikipedia, there shown to be release by label. So is not going to be that bad. It just like when SPA didn't produce Goosebumps movie because of live action with CGI things like monster. So we might wait and see if this movie will either be good or bad. Depends on how much the next trailer go including critics. I'm not defending the movie, I'm just giving you some news."
7Pa_Weidt08,"dear sony
how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
-everyone"
7Pa_Weidt08,...I kinda want to die now.
7Pa_Weidt08,"*Two days ago, at the Sony lot*

Sonic the Hedgehog: ""Cheer up, Tails! I'm sure the studio making my movie shouldn't be that ba-""

Sonic: ""Welp, time to bail, Tails!""

*Both Sonic and Tails quickly flee the Sony lot and end up crashing into a Paramount board meeting*

Paramount executive: ""Our next big hit franchise is here!"""
7Pa_Weidt08,"OH MY GOD. What an ABOMINATION! Its blasphemous!!! 
Beatrix Potter would be absolutely livid. Thanks for making me really, really ANGRY! 
Who is responsible for this crass bag of maggot vomit? Some board room full of soulless marketing people, no doubt, who want to continue to feed the public anything that can turn over a quick, unsatisfying buck. Always aiming for the wallets of a C minus audience, never A+. Gone are the days of kind gentle children's films, where you can take any child to see beloved and memorable characters created with love and lasting affection. Something to watch over and over...a ""classic"" that would stick around and continue to make a slower burning lasting profit for years. They can only see the opening weekend takings. Nothing else matters to them. I feel sorry for the talented and dedicated artists who have worked so hard on their craft, having to work for these soulless, mindless, talent less, marketing schmucks.
I'M SO ANGRY!! I feel like there is no hope and I'm old and out of touch, BUT I KNOW that I'm right and the marketing people at Sony ARE DEAD WRONG. I don't care what any of them, or their quarterly projections believe. There is a thing you can't put into numbers and it's called CHARM, LOVE, which this movie hasn't a trace of. 
Oh, and James Corden, who I like... why? You didn't need the money. Should have turned it down."
7Pa_Weidt08,What's the theme song
7Pa_Weidt08,"Awesome, I love when they take old, boring stuff like the original lame story and make it into something funny and modern like this! Well done Sony, this will be great."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I've read the books when I was a kid and my grandmother read the books to me at bedtime! Loved the books!! One book was ""The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit who had Bad Manners!"" The Original Peter Rabbit was a Mischievous Rabbit! I think Beatrix Potter would enjoy the take on her stories if she was alive today!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oh....my.....gosh....

Are you telling me that Sony STILL  have this capacity to take one of the most beloved children books from the past and turn into....THIS?!?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Stop.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is not how I remembered Peter Rabbit. Don't release this film, rather let Pixar handle this."
7Pa_Weidt08,I'M A LEMON
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony has taken a classic story and taken a big steaming dump on it.
7Pa_Weidt08,Shame on you Sony
7Pa_Weidt08,You take a hot steaming dump over Peter Rabbit. How dare you!
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh no...
7Pa_Weidt08,Laika is on the edge of bankruptcy and meanwhile there’s Sony making hundreds of millions!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why is this awesome animation, in this crappy movie...."
7Pa_Weidt08,You guys made a beloved character into a legit immoral kind of character!
7Pa_Weidt08,"I suggest Sony re-shoot some of this film, or they'll have a disaster on their hands."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is going to turn out just like the Dr Seuss movies
7Pa_Weidt08,What a way to murder a classic set of children's books. Way to go SONY!
7Pa_Weidt08,"what the hell, no. He's supposed to be an innocent calming and charming rabbit not a actual piece of party garbage ?! would rather watch the emoji movie"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Thank you for continuing to ruin animation in general, Sony Pictures."
7Pa_Weidt08,The studio is a bunch of tools.
7Pa_Weidt08,Shocking disgrace how to destroy a children's classic with inappropriate references and creating a bad example for children
7Pa_Weidt08,0:58 WHY BILL WEASLEY WHY?
7Pa_Weidt08,James Corden needs to fire his agent
7Pa_Weidt08,"You not only ruined multiple childhoods, you also ruined one of the few good songs on the charts. Shame on you."
7Pa_Weidt08,I wish ghosts would exist so that Beatrix Potter would haunt the hell out of those responsible for this.
7Pa_Weidt08,"1:15  A screaming pig, but no screaming goat? I don't understand."
7Pa_Weidt08,You gotta be fucking kidding me...
7Pa_Weidt08,"If you respected the original story parents would have taken their kids to see it and bought the dvd for Christmas. Instead we're treated to an insult to our childhood and guaranteed a flop at the box office .
When did peter rabbit start taking cocaine ?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is ""Hollywood appropriation"" at its most extreme, take a well known children's book character and turn it into Ghetto Sleaze. Way to go! PR is not ""street""! He's a bloody Rabbit!"
7Pa_Weidt08,No way! It’s bloody disgusting! Why are you doing this? I can’t see this is funny at all! Shame
7Pa_Weidt08,"I remember Peter Rabbit well from my Childhood, from Animated Stories by Beatrix Potter, to a song about Peter Rabbit having a fly upon his nose, from seeing him representing Easter in a way, to a CGI series, stuff like that. Now they have a movie, for all ages to see and enjoy, hopefully it won't ruin my childhood too much from how things are tweaked such as Peter Rabbit being older, all the characters being Party Animals, and Mr. McGregor being younger."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Jesus Christ, way to take something with genuine charm and creativity and turn it into some cancerous frat movie with that fat loudy one of the fucking lads lets be avin it cunts James Corden."
7Pa_Weidt08,"As if the ""deer in the headlights"" joke wasn't painfully obvious enough, they had to have the deer actually say ""headliiiights"" just in case the joke was too subtle for you to pick up. 
This is the level of writing we're dealing with here."
7Pa_Weidt08,This should have been an animated film with no pop culture references or modern humor. Who else agrees?
7Pa_Weidt08,0:17 what's the name of the song I heard it in the radio
7Pa_Weidt08,😀😁😂👑
7Pa_Weidt08,"All right, keep in mind that I never read any of the books as a kid, but this still looks AWFUL. First off, HOW THE F*CK DID MARGOT ROBBIE GET HIRED FOR THIS? Second, this looks like a Barnyard/Over The Hedge rip-off. Third, this is being made by the geniuses who made The Emoji Movie(I'm being sarcastic about the ""geniuses"" part of that statement, if you're wondering). Fourth, why the hell is this being released during the time of my birthday? The only good things about this whole trailer are that the animation looks nice and the deer in front of the car joke did get a chuckle out of me. Other than that, this has no reason to exist. Sony, stop trying to make kids stupider and actually release a good movie already, and if you can't, then just stick to making video games and technology."
7Pa_Weidt08,If you hate that much the movie why do you loose time writing a haters comment or putting a dislike on the video let it go just don’t watch the movie or the trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,"Just heard the song from this trailer on the radio. What's it called?

PS this looks terrible"
7Pa_Weidt08,shame on you Sony
7Pa_Weidt08,Why... I.. I'm really hoping that somehow this trailer is just terrible marketing and the movie isn't actually as bad as it looks. Way to disrespect Beatrix Potter. And ruin Domhnall Gleeson's streak of awesome movies.
7Pa_Weidt08,I haven't trusted a live action adaptation of any old children's book or TV show since Smurfs. Espacially from Sony for that matter.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Any other studio would've even attempted to make the film faithfully, but always trust Sony to make any stupid decision just to ruin a beloved franchise."
7Pa_Weidt08,"All you need to see ""Sony"""
7Pa_Weidt08,"The only reason everyone hates this film is because of the Emoji Movie, which I especially hate, but I love the trailer for Peter Rabbit!"
7Pa_Weidt08,What a pile of garbage.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Dear animators: Please leave Sony. You are talented, fantastic people who are making products that will ultimately be remembered as crap. This probably won't change either. There's millions of other better studios out there that would kill to have animators like you. Don't let your talents go to waste."
7Pa_Weidt08,"You think it will end the same way the original did? Ah, who am I kidding, they'd have to bump up the age rating if that happened."
7Pa_Weidt08,"This trend of modernizing old childhood animated classics to make them more ""hip and cool"" for the modern age needs to stop. It's cancer at the absolute worst level."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oh look, sony wants to make cash grab like they did for the retarded smurf movies."
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks bad. Really bad.

7Pa_Weidt08,"Watching this trailer after having watched ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is heartbreaking!! How fucking dare you?!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"And come on guys, the animal designs look pretty good. Their clothing is very remenicent of fables where animals wear those old timey clothes."
7Pa_Weidt08,I think it might be a little funny if they have parts of the movie where that fox would jump out from somewhere making that face just to scare people and laugh at them.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This isn't the Peter I know and love. They changed him into an obnoxious party goer. He was always sweet and a little mischievous, but not obnoxious and wild. Even though nothing can ruin Peter Rabbit for me, this movie is still very upsetting. I'm definitely not going to see it.I hope a trusted and actually reliable animation studio can make Peter Rabbit into a CGI movie, but stick to the original plot and have a kid voice act as Peter, not an adult."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I managed 22 seconds before I had to stop the video, run away into a darkened room and sit, curled up into a small ball, my eyes squeezed shut. Slowly trying to force the darkness from my mind and return to previous days when I lived in blissful ignorance of this horror.

I think I shall never sleep easy now. The night comes and the whispers of James Corden's voice haunt me still. The blue jacket and cottontailed rabbit, which once meant safety, now only bring the memories of this horror back. The bile rises in my throat and my stomach grows colder. Fear shall haunt me forever, fear in a little blue jacket.

So, I probably won't watch it when it comes out."

When the Emoji Movie came out, everyone went to see it so they could make bad reviews and tell others not to see it. What a noble sacrifice! Please. People, you were suckered into giving it free advertising. No publicity is bad publicity! Don't make the same mistake with this movie. If you want it to fail, don't go see it. Period. Bad profits send a much stronger message than angry, unfunny, 25-year-olds screaming into a camera."

If anyone is reading this go watch The World of Peter Rabbit. Hell go watch the TV series instead."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Everyone, imagine a future where Sony Animation Pictures goes out of business and there would be a new era in quality movies. Quality movies of old franchises that actually do them justice. Just imagine..."
7Pa_Weidt08,BOYCOTT!!!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,How could they get this so wrong?
7Pa_Weidt08,"So, it's Sausage Party with animals.

Sony, I question your sanity."
7Pa_Weidt08,The public domain is such an important concept that encourages creativity and the longevity of inventions and ideas... but Sony doesn't deserve to even breathe in Beatrix Potter's direction.
7Pa_Weidt08,Am I in hell?
7Pa_Weidt08,Honestly I want to see this movie. The thing is I never watched peter rabbit as a kid so why I want to watch this I don't know
7Pa_Weidt08,"Yessss sony
Who else is happy that this movie came out. Read my ful comment.

Sony wastes money on these movies
Sony goes bankrupt
Sony sells the spiderman rights to marvel
NO MORE VENOM VERSE"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Just got a email to attend a screening for this, yeah that is a no, not taking my daughter to see this."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony...... Sony...... Why are you doing this??? Why do you insist on ruining that which we used to love? Why do you insist on making terrible film that talk down to its potential audience?..... Please... Stop this.... This is not helping anyone... You're only going to cause your own destruction.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I thought the only thing left in my childhood that wouldn't be ruined by holly wood would be my peter rabbit book from way back when................ I was obviously wrong, goodbye childhood."
7Pa_Weidt08,The pig when he screams😂😂
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is a crime against humanity and an abomination. This is easily the cringiest thing I have ever seen. HOW DARE SONY. The books and original cartoons are nice, happy stories.
In this Peter is a drugged adult party animal with rock music. 
Die.
Just die.
Preferably slowly in the heart of Mount Doom. 

Thanks for ruining my childhood, (insert something here).

I wish I could dislike this 8 billion times."
7Pa_Weidt08,Please if you want your children to know Peter Rabbit please read them the books or let them watch the 90s TV show which was beautifully done. How dare you Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,You assholes. What is this crap?! If you're going to make a stupid animal movie leave Peter Rabbit out of it.
7Pa_Weidt08,I do not approve of this.
7Pa_Weidt08,I can smell furries in the distance
7Pa_Weidt08,You have fucked up now Sony
7Pa_Weidt08,"What is this, an hd remastered Hop"
7Pa_Weidt08,"At least with the Emoji movie we knew it was going to be bad just by the premise alone,  and this nothing of value was lost.

This is a bastardization of a beloved classic."
7Pa_Weidt08,And you guys are making a sonic movie in 2019? I bet it'll be just as bad as this movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,Fucking Sony...
7Pa_Weidt08,"This story is supposed to be simple, charming, and timeless. Poor Beatrix Potter."
7Pa_Weidt08,I was hoping the animals speak british accent
7Pa_Weidt08,"I'm questioning my childhood, and Mr. Tod, GET YOUR SLOBBERING JAWS AWAY FROM THAT RABBIT! well despite Everything I'll watch it for heck of it."
7Pa_Weidt08,I actually like the emoji movie and this is just TERRIBLE
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is there more dislikes?
7Pa_Weidt08,wow Hop 2 looks great
7Pa_Weidt08,*sigh* Sony if you wanted to make a film about loud party animals then make up your own characters don't take one's from a beloved children's series and ruin them
7Pa_Weidt08,"Hop but it's made in 2017. Also, WHY!?"
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm sad for humanity.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Facepalm.
Worst trailer I have seen so far"
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony Animation is dead.
7Pa_Weidt08,i really want to die now
7Pa_Weidt08,Isn't Peter supposed to be child? It looks okay
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie looks like cancer and is corny af. Not going to watch
7Pa_Weidt08,So.........either this movie gonna suck or its gonna be okay.......probably gonna suck
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony Animation vomited up The Angry Birds Movie, then ate the vomit only to spew it up again as The Emoji Movie. This time they've tried for a third time to keep it down but instead it's come back up yet again and splattered out of their mouths with enough force to knock a book off the bookshelf and into the puddle of half-digested ideas on the floor. Sadly that book was a beloved children's classic, emphasis on the word 'was'.

Still let the fun commence, this one won't even come close to FoodFight!'s crown, but it may well beat Elf Bowling The Movie in the list of terrible animated films. As the elderly hedgehog says, "" *Ohh yeah, now it's a parteh!* """
7Pa_Weidt08,"How removed from reality do you have to be to think, even for a moment, that this is a good idea?"
7Pa_Weidt08,This is Hop all over again.
7Pa_Weidt08,You know it's bad when the Nick Jr show is better than this.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Okay, this movie looks like it's going to massively suck.....but, I will admit that in this trailer, there were two funny jokes. McGregor and the pig screaming, and the deer in headlights joke"
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks AWFUL
7Pa_Weidt08,This is a garbage trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,"I feel like if they did this as an R rated comedy it'd work, but because it'll be rated PG it'll be horrible and have a redeeming character arc and a minimum of 500 fart jokes."
7Pa_Weidt08,"The way there acting and the music in the background make this movie look cringy, then again this is probably another flop for sony"
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony... fails again
7Pa_Weidt08,Whats the song
7Pa_Weidt08,This is a crime. My childhood is being crucified.
7Pa_Weidt08,"And I thought the CGI TV show was bad this is just grotesque!  Peter Rabbit was a major part of my childhood, this is filth."
7Pa_Weidt08,M just unliking cause it's a trend.
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow. Nothing's changed. And Sony are involved in the upcoming Sonic movie... May God have mercy on us all.
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie absolutely hilarious
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks horrendous
7Pa_Weidt08,What is this monstrosity? Sony Pictures what are you doing to Peter Rabbit? Not seeing this!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Not only does this miss the point of the book, it looks dumb."
7Pa_Weidt08,Its like the emoji movie but their direspecting an old classic
7Pa_Weidt08,"Dear Sony, Just stop making movies. For the Love Of God please stop!"
7Pa_Weidt08,After that I saw these comments I lost hope in humanity.... people incredibly triggered just because they decided to tell that old story in a different key.
7Pa_Weidt08,"im not even a fan of beatrix potter, and this looks abominable"
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh I bet the Nostalgia Critic can't WAIT to sink his teeth into this...
7Pa_Weidt08,This makes me want a live action Water ship down movie
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wouldn't a better story be him trying to get food for his family while having to dodge predators and farmers? They could've even made it a bit dark, or just a sweet little movie about family! THE HELL SONY YOU STOOPED SO LOW NOT EVEN A GODSEND MOVIE COULD LIFT YOU UP! BET THERE'S FART JOKES AND DRUNK JOKES! Ugh 1K Likes 3K Dislikes. Please Sony, just stop."
7Pa_Weidt08,This was bad to look at and I bet Beatrix Potter would agree because it going to fail
7Pa_Weidt08,"sony,  please stop making bad movies

-everyone"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Poor Beatrix Potter, I feel so sorry for you. How could ANYONE treat you like this? :'("
7Pa_Weidt08,God is dead and we are the murderers. And by we I mean Sony Pictures Animation.
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow ...its Rocking
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, do NOT release this! EVER!"
7Pa_Weidt08,What is this dross?!  Be ashamed; very shamed for making this.
7Pa_Weidt08,PLZ STAWWHHP SONY
7Pa_Weidt08,hmmm did peter rabbit ever do anything remotely like this?
7Pa_Weidt08,"You have just torn my childhood up into tiny pieces, eaten it, thrown it back up again, ate it a second time and the shat it back out"
7Pa_Weidt08,Just please please stop!
7Pa_Weidt08,I hate this film already
7Pa_Weidt08,"No, no, NO! Sony what have you done?! This look terrible...."
7Pa_Weidt08,Idk why people are triggered. The rabbits cute af idc
7Pa_Weidt08,Nope!
7Pa_Weidt08,hahahahaha poor Beatrix.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Phew, at least they've kept that 'American Pie', frat-house vibe the books had. Can't wait for the scene where Peter fucks McGregor 's mum."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, you need to stop this."
7Pa_Weidt08,story aside technically it looks awesome.  beautifully done.  Go Australia.
7Pa_Weidt08,I'd like all the people that downvoted Ghostbusters last year to see this atrocity so they can see how to REALLY destroy a franchise.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sigh .... there goes my childhood. Why do today's children's movies always have to be some big, poopy, frolick with twerking animals???? I have some choice and colourful words for that kind of drivel."
7Pa_Weidt08,Horrible.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony pictures does it again.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is insanely horrible. Seriously SONY? Peter Rabbit becomes a party animal? And what's with that
High School Musical tone? This is unacceptable in so many layers."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is a repeat of what happened with the smurfs. They put a cartoonish character with a human man and add in too many pop culture references. I'm calling it
7Pa_Weidt08,What is the music
7Pa_Weidt08,"I can't believe it, Sony made a movie based on a kid's book worse than the Mike Myers Cat in the hat movie. How the hell is that possible?!?!?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"first Mark Web's shitty spiderman films, then Ghostbusters 2016, then Rough Night, then the friggin emoji movie, and now this. Has sony learned nothing?"
7Pa_Weidt08,The cg animated tv show on nick jr has more dignity than this
7Pa_Weidt08,Rolling. In. Her. Grave.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Swirling whirlpool of awful, generic torment."
7Pa_Weidt08,Whats the song?
7Pa_Weidt08,This. is. Disgusting.
7Pa_Weidt08,I expect that there'll be much toilet humor. I just know it's gonna happen.
7Pa_Weidt08,Guys remember 1:28
7Pa_Weidt08,The way they made Peter in the movie kinda makes me think of Rocket from Guardians of the Galaxy.
7Pa_Weidt08,Everyone seems to hate it. Guess I'll be that one person who likes it
7Pa_Weidt08,I don't have any connection to Peter Rabbit but this is insulting on so many levels
7Pa_Weidt08,you have to give everything a chance and stop hating on the movie then again Hate is never going to end.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Stale jokes, awkward humor, terrible cg, butchering a beloved classic......Yup, this looks like Sony."
7Pa_Weidt08,This look like an underrated 2000s movie
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is the worst trailer I've ever seen, you should be ashamed sony"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Apparently, Sony is trying to Be like ""Paddington"", and so far, their failing miserably."
7Pa_Weidt08,"When I saw the title Peter Rabbit, I was confused for a moment before I remembered the cartoon I watched when I was a toddler. Then I watched this trailer...and I feel like weeping for yet another stupid attempt to make a 'modern' movie of what is probably a classic children's story."
7Pa_Weidt08,Here's an idea Sony: Stop
7Pa_Weidt08,what an abomination
7Pa_Weidt08,What is the song name?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Check out the 90's animated cartoons instead, this looks awful."
7Pa_Weidt08,"The combination of animation and live action is just a terrible, terrible call. Everything about this looks awful."
7Pa_Weidt08,"im hoping besides the old kid humor filler they'll focus on the angle that Peter is kinda full of himself thinking Mr McGregor will never catch him cause he thinks he's so smart. That's why im so far buying the undignified British accent and the attitude, think it can fit the character before he learns his lesson (there better be a lesson!)"
7Pa_Weidt08,Reminds me of kangaroo jack😂 and dr Dolittle
7Pa_Weidt08,Looks ok.....The graphics and original are saving it. As many commenters said the old lets stare and yell scene is disappointing. However it's not really meant for us it's for kids.
7Pa_Weidt08,"We’ll done Sony, you couldn’t have got this so wrong!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Fucking disgraceful.
7Pa_Weidt08,"STOP RUINING OUR CHILDHOODS SONY!
STOP WASTING TIME MAKING TERRIBLE FILMS AND FOCUS ON PLAYSTATION!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Please stop making CGI live action movies. They're a bit creepy.
7Pa_Weidt08,"WTAF? Just when you think the world couldn't get any dumber. 

On the bright side, Trump and Kim might have blown us all to Kingdom Come before this sees the light of day."
7Pa_Weidt08,Does James Corden have a 2 film contract with Sony Pictures Animation or something?
7Pa_Weidt08,James Corden cast as an apparently 'likeable' character? The end of the human race is nigh.
7Pa_Weidt08,I wish James Corden *WASN'T* Peter Rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,"I was interested when I heard there was Peter Rabbit movie coming, but I was disappointed the second I saw the Sony logo in the thumbnail.
Maybe you should just stick to making Bravias and Playstations to watch other companies' movies on."
7Pa_Weidt08,So basically this is what Zootopia would be like if it got a live action remake? Oh gosh! Get that image out of my head! Zootopia is better than this wacky movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,"from the people who brought to you Ghostbusters 2, Emojy nonsense, smurfs....another box office failure..."
7Pa_Weidt08,Everything about this is wrong.
7Pa_Weidt08,I thought my heart couldn't sink any lower after seeing Peter Rabbit throw lettuce leaves like dollar bills....and then they revealed it's a CGI/Live Action combo and I realized all was truly lost.
7Pa_Weidt08,what's that song?
7Pa_Weidt08,"I didn't think Sony Entertainment had money to throw down the pan ruining classic childrens' books but obviously they've been saving for a rainy day. This 'wacky contemporary' update has the shelf life of unpasteurised milk, and will more than likely smell as bad when it hits theatres."
7Pa_Weidt08,"'Discover the rabbit behind the legend' 

What on earth?!

I've always wanted to know the backstory behind Peter Rabbit, he must be such a complex character...

🤦‍♂️"
7Pa_Weidt08,what was the song in the backround
7Pa_Weidt08,"NO NO NO! Why does every children's movie have to be a weird, innuendo filled, slapstick mess! You could have done something really beautiful. The animation is actually pretty good so why couldn't you apply it to a better STORY not just taking characters from our childhood and making them act like a frat boy! You could have made a movie about Peter Rabbit and had it be a dramatized version of the story of a CHILD rabbit played by an actual CHILD actor, no offense to James Cordon but seriously! All this movie does is disrespect its audience (what do you think we're idiots that are actually going to see this movie just because it's Peter Rabbit) and disrespect the source material. Like many of these commenters are saying Beatrix Potter is rolling in her grave. Neither me nor any of my siblings are going to be seeing this movie. It's a disgrace, nick Jr. did better!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Probably going to wind up like Alvin and the Chipmunks, but much much worse. GOD HELP US ALL"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why the hell would you do this
Just why"
7Pa_Weidt08,No. Just no.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I don't know why everyone's so angry(Well, no I completely know why everyone's so angry, this is a disgrace!). The point I'm trying to make is that this is so paint by the numbers and filled with every terrible animated/live action kids movie trope, it's exactly what I expected Sony to do with the IP. It's been done a billion times over before! You'd think by now this would stop enraging us but NOPE! Maybe that's a good thing, though. If everyone shouts loud enough, some day, SOME DAY, they might hear us. Unless of course this ends up being a box office hit for no comprehensible reason at all and they make bank off of it. Then Sony make a squeal that is somehow WORSE than this. Atleast it's fun to shout at stuff, right? We've still got that going for us?"
7Pa_Weidt08,As if humanity needed any more reasons to hate James Corden.
7Pa_Weidt08,Fucking James Corden should be nuked from orbit.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony....just stop.
7Pa_Weidt08,Don't ruin my childhood please.
7Pa_Weidt08,So its over the hedge except with a classical story that really wasnt even used besides for its cute bunny characters. Its sad because I remember reading somewhere that beatrix potter wrote this for her cousin. This book was my fave and I remember asking to get the perfect hardcover for it... the movie... its like an abridged anime of a classical book lol.  Or something like reb00t ghostbusters
7Pa_Weidt08,"At 1:23, you can see a hand opening the piano."
7Pa_Weidt08,The head of Sony's animated film division obviously has a death wish
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter Rabbit? This is Hop mixed with Barnyard.
7Pa_Weidt08,F*** YOU SONY.
7Pa_Weidt08,"What is that horrible smell? Oh yeah. That's Sony, shitting out another terrible movie."
7Pa_Weidt08,"They could have done it like ""Paddington"". But nooooooooooooooooo."
7Pa_Weidt08,"I feel like the ""screaming at each other"" gag was invented in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. But the difference between WFRR and a lot of the other films that use it is that WFRR executed the joke well!"
7Pa_Weidt08,I didn't grow up with Peter Rabbit and even I feel insulted.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I am sure that, somewhere in the spirit world, Beatrix Potter is tearing her hair out and shrieking with rage..."
7Pa_Weidt08,"5/10
The animation, style, and designs looked good.The jokes, voices, loss of charm, etc. just no"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Here's my solution. Just call it Potter Hare or something and make it a spoof/parody.
Problem solved."
7Pa_Weidt08,Of course peoppe judge it by it's first trailer (only trailer)
7Pa_Weidt08,I have no faith in this already.
7Pa_Weidt08,This will be a good one to see next year. I will love to see Peter Rabbit on the big screen.
7Pa_Weidt08,*when I saw the trailer **https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY*
7Pa_Weidt08,I could fart a funnier performance than anything James Corden has done in his career.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Please Sony, stop it!"
7Pa_Weidt08,This thing upset me the moment I saw McGreggor.
7Pa_Weidt08,See Hop 2 In Theaters 2018
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sooooo, did the producers even READ Beatrix Potter's books? Or did they just decide to take the characters and create 2017 partiers to make them relevant to this decade's humour?

If Beatrix only knew what kind of messy concoction was just summoned with her stories and characters."
7Pa_Weidt08,i like it :v
7Pa_Weidt08,Rated G for Garbage.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony really scraping the bottom of the barrel
7Pa_Weidt08,the worst thing is that the plot is a fucking rip off of BEE MOVIE only with a rabbit instead
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sees Peter Rabbit. OK
Sees SONY. Nope, nothing to see here."
7Pa_Weidt08,This actually ruined my day.
7Pa_Weidt08,"God, I wish someone would put the bankruptcy up this cunty company."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is the first time I've felt genuine anger in years
7Pa_Weidt08,Memeoulous where you at?
7Pa_Weidt08,What did Beatrix Potter do to deserve this?
7Pa_Weidt08,The first I saw this I though that Sony is trying to rip-off HOP from Illumination Entertainment. But later I was investigating and Peter Rabbit was a cartoon for kids. This will end up just like the Smurfs and his terrible sequel.
7Pa_Weidt08,Pennywise is real... except he isn't a clown.. he is Sony film executive.
7Pa_Weidt08,Does Corden have a film deal with Sony? Because it's going so well so far 🤔
7Pa_Weidt08,Only Sony would know how to ruin good literature
7Pa_Weidt08,As if the Emoji movie wasn't enough
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow, the marketing guys basically run Hollywood at this point..."
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow this looks awful. I have a feeling that this movie is gonna make root for the humans because screw those animals.
7Pa_Weidt08,ofcourse its Sony....fucking hell do they ever stop?
7Pa_Weidt08,"No. No. No. No. No. NO. Sony Pictures you cannot do this to Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit. NO! You can make as many bad pictures as you like with your emoji movies and your mediocre animation. But you DARE touch UK's heritage and my childhood, Beatrix Potter's classic stories and you tarnish it with your trash writing. Modernising Peter Rabbit and making him a party goer?! UGH. It's completely disgraceful to Beatrix Potter. I'm just horrified. I can't. Will be avoiding this like the plague."
7Pa_Weidt08,what's the song used the in the trailer?
7Pa_Weidt08,"after the emoji movie, THIS IS HOW SONY TRIES TO REDEEM THEMSELVES?!?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Its about the movie not about the title
7Pa_Weidt08,People spend time on this and i like the movie
7Pa_Weidt08,At least the Nick show is more faithful to the original
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony Animation needs to see the light and realize that no one likes the movies they're making. Either start making better movies or go away.
7Pa_Weidt08,It's moments like this where a dislike bar is so beautiful.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why does Animal Logic's talent always end up being wasted (I'm talking to you, Walking With Dinosaurs 3D)"
7Pa_Weidt08,wtf why so many dislikes?!?!?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Screw you, Sony. Taking a beloved timeless classic by one of England's greatest authors and crapping all over it."
7Pa_Weidt08,How dare you ruin a timeless classic
7Pa_Weidt08,#BoycottPeterRabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,Looks every bit as bad as I've been hoping it will be.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is those 2 live action Smurfs films all over again
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is wrong on so many levels. 
It's ruining a classic children's book. Sony's gone too far. They have to be stopped."
7Pa_Weidt08,*drinks lots of alcohol*
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter is BRITISH not fucking aussie.they cant even tell the diffrence and made a movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,What song is played cause that's the only good part of the trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,It thought it was gonna be a hop 2 trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,I want to F**k this movie!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Children don't always need amped up, high energy entertainment. They often prefer a slower paced, quiet, ""cozy"", charming movies. Peter Rabbit is perfect for that kind of entertainment, where a special world is opened up for a child to discover. There is a Japanese filmmaker who does this - his movies are a world unto themselves, and children are mesmerized by them."
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix potter is gonna haunt the movie producer who is making this crap
7Pa_Weidt08,Whats the song called in thack ground !!! Its driving me & my friend's mad cos its good !! Please can someone help us ?????
7Pa_Weidt08,"NO! 
 NO! 👉
 STAP IT! 👉"
7Pa_Weidt08,"The disgusting, gluttonous, talentless hack that is James Corden will lend himself to literally anything that will line his pockets"
7Pa_Weidt08,It says Peter rabbit but what see is Smurfs 4. I want to see cause it captures my attention because my mom used to read the books and show the cartoon. And because this until i see the whole movie then thats when i can truly judge it and based on what you have given us here its like a very STRANGE mixture of Smurfs and HOP. So in a nutshell this trailer is garbage. I will go see it but dont expect praise when i do
7Pa_Weidt08,Forget whitewashing things what's with James Cordon washing everything
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks awful.  I grew up a few miles away from Far Sawrey.  I guarantee that everybody from that part of the world (me included) is going to be horribly embarrassed by this.  It's totally wrong.  Mrs Tiggywinkle would have a seizure at the mess left in that house.  A question for James Cordon: Why?  Why did you do this?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Aw man, this is going to be so bad"
7Pa_Weidt08,Where is memeulous?
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony still want's to be cool so badly...
7Pa_Weidt08,This is going to be the worst movie ever.
7Pa_Weidt08,.....This movie's gonna be sh*t
7Pa_Weidt08,Why create a mockery out of a classic.
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie is garbage.
7Pa_Weidt08,"*doesnt know anything about Peter rabbit*
*sees this video in recommended*
*clicks it*
*sees dislikes*

SONY DON GOOFED!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Man, that Peter Rabbit is one outrageous dude!!!!!1111xDxDxD"
7Pa_Weidt08,You destroy my childhood.
7Pa_Weidt08,The worst part for me is that I showed this trailer to my parents... my mother said that she'd ACTUALLY LIKE TO GO AND SEE IT!
7Pa_Weidt08,"There's nothing charming, funny or endearing about this. It's a sickening cash grab, with no effort whatsoever put in towards being faithful to the source material."
7Pa_Weidt08,Actually how dare you Sony
7Pa_Weidt08,WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT IS THIS?!? This is NOT my childhood. Screw you Sony with your pandering bullshit! Go away!
7Pa_Weidt08,I am convinced that Sony is actively trying to go bankrupt by this point
7Pa_Weidt08,James Corden is the new Adam Sandler.
7Pa_Weidt08,"that looks sh*t , another film to cash in on a famous brand, and totally f**k it up."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Tisk-tisk-tisk!
If you want the movie/books appeal to the kids of today, just stick with the original charms and formula of the books.

Not all kids want the ""hip,"" ""extreme, nor ""in your face"" kind of entertainment that talks down to them & annoy their parents.

When I was little & watched the animated series of the stories; I wasn't bored by all of the ""big words,"" ""lack of humor,"" nor the ""lame"" orchestra like music;
I was entertained by them, and even now as an adult, I still enjoy them.

Beatrix Potter books are like the A.A. Milne books have a simple innocent charm to them that should NEVER be tainted with whatever you think kids are into these days."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Paddington: I made a film that actively worked against the source material in a cynical cash grab that essentially alienated all of the fans and was roundly panned by reviewers and audience members alike.
Peter Rabbit: Hold my Beer!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"...why do I love this even though it looks so ridiculous. It's not even accurate to the original story at all!
Oh well. :P"
7Pa_Weidt08,"oh no, the have 'smurf' it...-.-"
7Pa_Weidt08,Gosh DARNIT this comments section is ridiculous I am probably going to get hated for this but I am interested to see this movie especially if it has James Corden in it So everyone just deal with they are making this movie anyways you can't really stop a film that's already started production I'd like to see all of you make a film by yourselves
7Pa_Weidt08,The only thing I liked about this trailer was the song
7Pa_Weidt08,Do yourselves a favour Sony. Cancel this one.
7Pa_Weidt08,Can I dislike this twice? It's like leftover jokes from Hop.
7Pa_Weidt08,"The only thing that could make this better.....          





.....is Peter rabbit snorting carrots."
7Pa_Weidt08,It's looks okay but what's the story
7Pa_Weidt08,Only thing good about this trailer is the song that plays in it.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Go Home Sony, You're Drunk"
7Pa_Weidt08,ピーターラビット原作名義じゃなければもっとマシだった
7Pa_Weidt08,Why are people disliking this video it's nothing like the emoji movie
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie looks hilarious
7Pa_Weidt08,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
7Pa_Weidt08,THIS IS _T R A S H_
7Pa_Weidt08,Lol this is going to be funny! HaHa!❤😂😂😂😂🐰
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is everyone hating Sony? And how can this movie be that bad? I think it's funny
7Pa_Weidt08,For fucks sake.
7Pa_Weidt08,I got so excited when i heard there was going to be a Peter Rabbit film but now I'm disappointed. It's such a waste because the animation looks amazing but the content is just as bad as any other kids film these days. I honestly feel like they could have tried appealing to an older audience since we grew up with this story & not as many kids nowadays know about it. Instead of making a sweet innocent movie they made this... :(
7Pa_Weidt08,"Lost all trust on you making a Stuart Little reboot, like literally lost al living trust"
7Pa_Weidt08,So he must be General Hux cousin
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm depressed that Rey is in this movie 😭
7Pa_Weidt08,It does look disrespectful to the source material but at least James Corden as Peter Rabbit is marvelously a quintessential casting decision
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony needs to die. Like, right now."
7Pa_Weidt08,It would have been funnier if he sat on a porcupine by accident instead of screaming after he saw an anthropomorphic pig
7Pa_Weidt08,Well This movie feels like The Live Action Smurfs strikes back again with full of filler
7Pa_Weidt08,"""This is only the beginning."" Oh fucking Christ, I hope it's not."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Shiet. Absolute rabbit shiet. Unfaithful to the original source, well done Sony. And honestly for me, it could be at least a lil better if the whole movie were CGI."
7Pa_Weidt08,Why
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow how Ungrateful people have become almost makes me puke (bluuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!)
7Pa_Weidt08,"The is actually one of the worst movie trailers I've ever seen.

Worse than Tiptoes

Worse than Ghostbusters 2016

Worse than Judge Dredd

This is actually awful, this trailer makes me sad"
7Pa_Weidt08,well i guess the world didn't end today like it was supposed to.
7Pa_Weidt08,Who here watched the old cartoon the world of Peter rabbits and friends
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, just stop. You clearly have no idea how to make movies. Just... just... STOP."
7Pa_Weidt08,"And I thought the emoji movie was dumb, oh how ive underestimated them.."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is a rancid dump on a popular book like cat in the hat but makes it feels like a ripoff of Nickelodeon 's barnyard
7Pa_Weidt08,Please cancel this
7Pa_Weidt08,This sucks they didn't even follow the book they tried to make it cool and funny...this was my favorite book as a kid..I haven't read it in a while but I don't remember it being like this.
7Pa_Weidt08,yet another generic movie with popmusic and PARRTTYY! 1/10 for effort
7Pa_Weidt08,"When Sony pitched this idea to its board members, all they presented was a drawing of Peter Rabbit getting raped by the Monopoly Man over Beatrix Potter's unkept grave. I'm just guessing."
7Pa_Weidt08,Primero aaa como se llama la cancion
7Pa_Weidt08,"This time, Sony Animation isn't even behind this. They just slapped its name in the credits because blah."
7Pa_Weidt08,HAAAAHAAAAHAAAHAAAAA!!  Where's your sense of humor???
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, please stop murdering beloved children's characters. We're all getting pretty sick of it. I'm Cumbrian and this is an insult to a charming icon of my beautiful home."
7Pa_Weidt08,A stunningly inept piece of garbage.
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is Sony Animation still running as a studio?
7Pa_Weidt08,James Corden is about as appealing as a drowning kitten
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh Peter what have they done to you I'll stick to Mrs Potter in future at least that is true to her characters
7Pa_Weidt08,I know this is going to flop just as hard as The Emoji Movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,This Movie Based On A Book
7Pa_Weidt08,"I read Beatrix potters books as a kid and I loved them, this movie is just shitting all over her work."
7Pa_Weidt08,Mother of god it's all toilet sounds
7Pa_Weidt08,MY GOD SONY LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES AKA THE EMOJI MOVIE
7Pa_Weidt08,"And we see that Sony STILL hasn't learned their lesson.







I hate myself for ever trusting Sony in the first place."
7Pa_Weidt08,"NO YOU'VE BUTCHERED MY CHILDHOOD 


NO."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Erh... dafuck??! 
I mean... is any of the producers of this familiar with Beatrix Potter's work or what? The animation is not bad and I do love Domhnall Gleeson very much, but, please, do yourself a favour people, buy the books, don't go watch this affront."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ladies and gentlemen, please accept my sincerest apologies for this."
7Pa_Weidt08,Fucking James Cordon. Beatrix Potter is rolling in her grave
7Pa_Weidt08,"I showed this to my mum and it made her cry in disgust. Sony, you just ruined her childhood obsession. You have ruined the art and passion of Beatrix Potters work and have once again made a terrible movie. You are a dishonorable conformist company that do nothing but make people miserable and angry with your cheap attempts at making good movies. End the company you insignificant scum bags."
7Pa_Weidt08,Here comes the cringe....
7Pa_Weidt08,Seriously what is wrong with the world recently
7Pa_Weidt08,Brexit Britain being perfectly represented by this trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is fucking appalling. How dare you destroy a childhood British classic like this. Shame on you, and shame on cordon for supporting this bullshit.
If this is the direction film is going in then I don't want to live on earth anymore. Beatrix Potter would be disgusted."
7Pa_Weidt08,Hop???
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks like it might be the worst movie of all time.
7Pa_Weidt08,"How could Sony do this!?! I thought this would be an innocent charming children's film in the lines of Winnie the Pooh and Paddington, But no they have to turn this to Illumination's Hop or their stupid Bulgy eyed Smurf movies from years back."
7Pa_Weidt08,"So much wasted potential. I feel like this could have been great, If it didn't have James Corden, the shitty humour and the modern day time setting."
7Pa_Weidt08,Dear God...James Corden is now every British guy in any animated movie and it is driving me insane. Beatrix Potter could power a city from the momentum she's created from rolling in her grave.
7Pa_Weidt08,Wtf does this have to do with Peter Rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,Watching this makes me cringe about how what could have happened if Sony animation did the peanuts movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,Never has this Nostalgia Critic scene been more relevant. https://youtu.be/kykWBUOY94E
7Pa_Weidt08,"Remember when Sony worked on Cloudy with A Chance of Meatball?
Yep, they're not even trying anymore."
7Pa_Weidt08,"How to do a live action animation done charmingly well, WATCH PADDINGTON."
7Pa_Weidt08,They're screwing with a classic and with my beloved childhood stories!
7Pa_Weidt08,"I would just like to point out that animation in this style and live-action don't really mix unless it's written well and has less nauseating scenes. Movies like The Smurfs and it's sequel, Alvin and the Chipmunks and it's sequels, Hop, G-Force, Cats and Dogs and it's unforgettable sequel, Garfield and it's sequel and Underdog did not do well. Also the scream at 1:13 sounds like the goat scream."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is so disrespectfull toward the source material!!
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh look another effortless cashout version of someone else's good idea by Sony
7Pa_Weidt08,"I have a bad feeling that somewhere down the line this movie got rewritten to appear cool. That happened with the original Smurfs movie, where it was initially going to be closer to the source material, but they switched it to live-action. The designs of the characters are really well done and accurate to what they should look like, but story, dialogue, and tone is completely off. Probably somewhere in development they designed a moderately faithful adaptation... I hope..."
7Pa_Weidt08,I thought that trend of having CGI animal's in the real world fucking died
7Pa_Weidt08,Also I want to say that Mrs Tiggywinkle would never have allowed such a messy party
7Pa_Weidt08,I do not think this is the Beatrix Potter movie I wanted
7Pa_Weidt08,Whats the trailer song called
7Pa_Weidt08,Why sony? WHY???
7Pa_Weidt08,"Okay okay, I ONLY laughed at the end with the deer in the headlights"
7Pa_Weidt08,This trailer will most likely show up on My Little Pony: The Movie when it comes out this October.
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow. This is such a misfire! Unbelievable.
7Pa_Weidt08,Please don't take your children to see this. Children deserve better. Everything is dumbed down now. I'm so glad I grew up in the 80s/90s.
7Pa_Weidt08,Rip Sony pictures
7Pa_Weidt08,We have discovered the antithesis to Pixar
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is an abomination. But with James Corden as Peter Rabbit I suppose it's to be expected. In this version, Mr McGregor kills and eats all of Peter's siblings, but Peter forgives him and gives him a big kiss."
7Pa_Weidt08,"You could literally give this movie another title and it wouldn't make any difference, they just put peter rabbit on there because it is somewhat familiar to people."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony Pictures Animation needs to be put down for the good of humanity
7Pa_Weidt08,"What the fuck's going on with you, Sony????"
7Pa_Weidt08,wasnt peter suppose to be innocent?
7Pa_Weidt08,"I was so excited about this movie. I was depressed for a week cuz I was too late to get to the filming grounds, I was hoping to get a peek. But I'm disappointed now."
7Pa_Weidt08,"It's sad that Domhall Gleeson went from Star Wars...to this.

But all in all, while it does look bad, it's mainly harmless, even if it is alien to the source material."
7Pa_Weidt08,Song?
7Pa_Weidt08,This is not the tone I wanted for an adaptation of that series...
7Pa_Weidt08,what is this song
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well, I don't even know the original story of this movie itself, but I like this anyway, because I need some comedy movies (especially in my place)."
7Pa_Weidt08,Okay people on here who are complaining please stop it because honestly Peter Rabbit cartoons and books were boring you just feel that way because you're older now seriously I mean really when's the last time you read a Peter Rabbit book to your kids without you and your kids falling asleep come on guys add a new twist to something stop acting like old farts all the time
7Pa_Weidt08,"You did something good for once sony. Also, Fire the director of the emoji movie."
7Pa_Weidt08,Hop ripoff.
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks atrocious.
7Pa_Weidt08,"For anyone who's interested in the actual plot of this, apparently it's about Peter Rabbit and Mr McGregor competing for the love of a woman (who is, apparently, human)."
7Pa_Weidt08,Childhood just went down the drain... Beatrix Potter is shaking her head in HUGE disappointment in heaven because of how shameful this trailer is. It also destroys everything you loved about the Peter Rabbit books. At least the Nick Jr show is more respectable to Beatrix Potter than this.
7Pa_Weidt08,Remember when people complained about Michael Bays TMNT? I'd like to go back to those times now.
7Pa_Weidt08,Anyone noticed how James Corden is slowly destroying his career
7Pa_Weidt08,Sooooooooonyyyyyyyyy!! What is wrong with you morons and your live action crap. I swear you better not screw up the Sonic movie or I will find you jerks in your sleep.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, stop it. Stop it right now before anyone else gets hurt."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, IT'S TIME TO STOP.
Sell MGM to Universal or something, and just quit the movie business for good. Nobody wants you here anymore."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony pls stop.
7Pa_Weidt08,This is only the teaser. I have a feeling as time goes on we'll see more of the story.
7Pa_Weidt08,We truly are in the darkest timeline.
7Pa_Weidt08,You could've made this so charming and expanded the Peter Rabbit true story to fit in all the main characters but instead you produce this nonsense. Beatrix Potter would find this a degrading insult to the character and the world she created 🙈
7Pa_Weidt08,"everyone: You made the emoji movie, how could you even sink lower?
Sony Pictures: hold my beer"
7Pa_Weidt08,"YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, SONY"
7Pa_Weidt08,The nick jr show is better than this
7Pa_Weidt08,I love this! Why are there people that hate it so much? Is that what the movie industry is like?
7Pa_Weidt08,When you think it couldn't be anymore worse then you hear James Cordens voice
7Pa_Weidt08,Well...
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow first that fucking Emojii movie and now this. Congrats Sony you greedy disrespectful pricks
7Pa_Weidt08,1:13 My reaction to this -movie trailer- monstrosity.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This looks so bad, I don't even think it'll even make it onto the So-Bad-It's-Good list."
7Pa_Weidt08,"SONG:"" Portugal. The Man - ""Feel It Still"" (Official Video)"""
7Pa_Weidt08,Looks Great! :D
7Pa_Weidt08,Song name please!
7Pa_Weidt08,Emoji movie was terrible I think this movie is going to redeem sony it looks bloody awesome
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony please stop surfs  up 2,smurfs lost village,Emoji movie,The star now Peter rabbit please stop"
7Pa_Weidt08,This is not right
7Pa_Weidt08,anybody else think that the part where the guy finds the pig sounds like a who has the best screaming goat impression contest
7Pa_Weidt08,"This looks like trash. Why do so many films have to be stupid, over the top slapstick or gross out comedy to be a kids' movie? I loved the animated and live action Peter Rabbit movies I had as a kid, they were simple and didn't need to totally reinvent the source material for them to be enjoyable.  Children's movies can be intelligent and still be extremely well loved classics. Just take a look at Studio Ghibli or even Avatar: The Last Airbender, yes they can be fantastical and have slapstick but they maintain their integrity as quality entertainment because they don't assume children will only be entertained by base level humor like a rabbit slamming into birds or two characters screaming at each other. The lack of effort here is abhorrent and irritating."
7Pa_Weidt08,One of the things I loved when I was a kid was watching The World of Peter Rabbit and Friend on the BBC. This pales in comparison.
7Pa_Weidt08,I wonder if the Death Note could wipe out an entire studio?
7Pa_Weidt08,Everyone who signed off on this movie needs to be executed
7Pa_Weidt08,I never was a fan of the original but this makes the emoji movie look like Citizen Kane
7Pa_Weidt08,That's amazing🐰🐰🐰
7Pa_Weidt08,Delete your animation studio
7Pa_Weidt08,"So, this isn't Peter Rabbit BUT it does look incredibly funny, cute and a nice movie. It is a shame that the directors thought Peter Rabbit had to be 'modernised'."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Until the 0:13 I though this was going be something, but NO!
What classic they're gonna ruin next? 
The Wind in The Willows? Animals of Farthing Wood? Animal Farm? Watership Down perhaps?"
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks fucking atrocious.
7Pa_Weidt08,LOL General Hux's scream cracked me up...
7Pa_Weidt08,Let's play a game. Cover up the title of this trailer. Show it to a friend. Try to see if they can guess what the movie's called.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I remember when where the wild things came out, and a reviewer said it could have been static CGI with Max doing a dive out of a tree and three precocious wild things magically having score cards to rate him with ready at an inexorable speed.
This is pretty much a realization of that type of CRAP."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow... great animation but the ""hipping it up"" thing has been done to death =("
7Pa_Weidt08,The only animal I see in this is a cash cow
7Pa_Weidt08,I have  to see that movie  petter rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,I have  to see that movie  petter rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,I have  to see that movie  petter rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,I have  to see that movie
7Pa_Weidt08,I have  to see that movie
7Pa_Weidt08,I Love Rose Byrne
7Pa_Weidt08,Behold pure liquid cancer. This is a fucking disgrace.
7Pa_Weidt08,no. just... no. get the books. read them to your children. don't support this trash.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Beatrix Potter should just rise from the grave right now and murder James Corden.

In fact, thinking about it, that probably would've been a more interesting film."
7Pa_Weidt08,name of the song pls
7Pa_Weidt08,My grandma gave me a doll of it when I was little and still have it today I miss you grandma
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony Pictures. Stop fucking up good concepts. 
This doesn't look like anything from the books."
7Pa_Weidt08,I didn't have this image.
7Pa_Weidt08,"**watches the first few seconds of the trailer** Oh, this might be ni- **then the rest of the trailer goes on.
Stage one: the look of disgust could be felt from space....Eye-twitching, followed by lack of appetite...
Stage two: shock and horror, subject begins to feel bewildered confusion and desperation.
Stage three: subject feels great encroaching feeling of dread and anger washing over them...followed by ultimate disgust.
Stage four: Stuttering breaths, observable cringing, followed by attempts to refrain from vomiting. Dry heaves, shakes, paling discoloration of the face and having to adjourn from the room that holds the computer where subject has been made to watch the...media(trailer).
Stage five: righteous indignation and justified conspiracy to undermine the corruption and bring it to light, forcing the corrupted to correct themselves or suffer the shame.....
Stage six: post mortem depression

We warned you with Spider Man, we warned you with Ghostbusters(2016), and you only RECENTLY got a clue with the Emoji movie. Maybe now you will all listen. SONY holds nothing sacred, and respects nothing. Hence, they have earned nothing.
And this better not be a ruse, SONY. If so, it is the most shamefully shameless ruse in all of media history, and your movie should not be seen based simply on that merit alone.
Regardless: quit playin' SONY. QUIT PLAYIN'!"
7Pa_Weidt08,0:22 copypaste of nick wilde xD
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie has Australian actresses like Paddington.
7Pa_Weidt08,I wish I could downvote this 8000 more times.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This actually makes me just a wee bit queasy. I grew up with Peter rabbit. They were silly, gentle, mellow books about bunnies sneaking into the neighbor's garden and having the kind of small misadventures  one might have as a small child. They were sweet. They were relatable, just classic stories.
They were not this pile of festering, putrid cgi garbage. What trash. Everyone involved should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. They should cry themselves to sleep on the bags of money they'll probably make off of it.
Aaaaand I'll go a step further; if you take your kids to this movie, you probably shouldn't procreate."
7Pa_Weidt08,That Sony Pictures emblem ruined this before it even began.
7Pa_Weidt08,"James Corden's Peter Rabbit is literally Poochie. He doesn't get busy, he gets bizz-ay."
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow 2017 isn't a good year for Sony Animation.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Great, I cant stand James Cordon"
7Pa_Weidt08,"People in these comments apparently missed the part in the beginning where it starts off idyllic and innocent then goes off the rails.  There's obviously more to this movie than what's in the trailer and I'd bet you anything that it involves Peter starting out a ""nonce"" (as one of you put it) and ends up with him being decent guy closer to the character in the books.

But, you know, nerd raging is easier to accomplish than critical thinking, so I'll just peace out and let you all continue to blow your collective gaskets having never seen the full movie."
7Pa_Weidt08,"""The horror...the horror..."""
7Pa_Weidt08,Man HOP 2 looks crazy
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, stop fucking making movies, you will never make another good movie again. Just give up."
7Pa_Weidt08,this is garbage
7Pa_Weidt08,"anyway: whats next, Wind in the willows adapted into a horror/slasher comedy?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Someone saw the pitch for this, and gave the people behind this money to make this? or did they say something else, run out of money and then do this?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Not bad
7Pa_Weidt08,"I get that they need to expand the story to make a full length movie, but they are going about this the wrong way."
7Pa_Weidt08,I will rejoice the day Sony Pictures Animation finally dies.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Go home Sony Pictures Animation, you're drunk!"
7Pa_Weidt08,You'll float too
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is Sony so bad. Why. Is. Sony. So. Bad?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Head's up, people, we got another GB16 on our hands..."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Shame on you Sony! By all accounts, you ruined a most beloved character! This was certainly a series you should have never even thought to have touched!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Who sings that song
7Pa_Weidt08,"Can you spell ""dead inside""?"
7Pa_Weidt08,So... you folks are just COMPLETELY out of ideas now I assume...
7Pa_Weidt08,When will Sony learn? Also Peter Rabbit tm
7Pa_Weidt08,"I'm still waiting on that Fidget Spinner movie, come on Sony we know you're that pathetic and desperate"
7Pa_Weidt08,Just NO.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Boy Sony is really knocking it out of the park with their movies. You know with ghostbusters, the smurfs, the emoji movie,  jumanji and now this instant classic. Wow just awesome. Im totally not being sarcastic at all... *wink wink*"
7Pa_Weidt08,"/v/ was right, you have to be stopped."
7Pa_Weidt08,"You crossed the line, Sony...smdh"
7Pa_Weidt08,"I'm having 2004 flashbacks right now, I dunno if this looks like another generic live action adaptation or a parody"
7Pa_Weidt08,"If you haven't read the book, just do that instead"
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks awful
7Pa_Weidt08,SERIOUSLY?!?!?  I'M DISGUSTED...
7Pa_Weidt08,"ever since I heard that James Corden is going to play as Peter Rabbit,  I knew that the film was going to be a disaster!!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"As soon as I saw the Sony Pictures Animation logo, my heart sunk.

You know why."
7Pa_Weidt08,"It looks like the Emoji Movie wasn't the worst thing sony could do. Better have a scene where Peter plays Playstation 4, and watches youtube on a sony laptop."
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is General Hux (or Bill Weasley for you Potterheads) screaming like a goat?
7Pa_Weidt08,"I don't think Peter Rabbit transfers well to this style of movie.
Needs some class. Something. Some charm. Have some bleedin respect for the source material PLEASE. 

I really really hate this."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow Hollywood, looks like you're not only ruining a childhood classic but trying to teach children to party early."
7Pa_Weidt08,I do admit this film is slightly different than the books it was based on but at least it brings a new spin on the classic literature character.
7Pa_Weidt08,"First off, how dare you butcher a beloved children's classic in this way. Now that my outrage is out of the way, can we be real here? Just because you want to appeal to kids, it doesn't mean it needs to be 'hip' and 'with it' . Doing that just makes it dated before it's even released. The original book was a timeless classic, and can still be enjoyed today. Also, just because it's a ""kids movie"" doesn't mean you don't have to try. Kids deserve quality entertainment too. And this.... this is NOT quality entertainment."
7Pa_Weidt08,"This probably doesn't apply to the general public but- anytime anyone uses a song Apple already used in their marketing material I almost always just associate it with them from then on and it just feels lazy when someone else uses it. Feels like someone just saw an Apple ad and went, ""Yeah alright, let's use that song."""
7Pa_Weidt08,"What's wrong  with Sony? Are they producers so out of touch with audience, they think this is acceptable"
7Pa_Weidt08,like iwas happy then THEN...0:03
7Pa_Weidt08,i would be okay with it if it was more like the original!!
7Pa_Weidt08,not peter rabbit!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,I didn't realize Sony was making the sequel to Hop.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Please stop, Sony. Please."
7Pa_Weidt08,"How. Crass. How. Cheap. How. Dare. You,  Sony!!.  James Cordon you should know better."
7Pa_Weidt08,"First The Emoji Movie, Now This... James Corden Needs A Better Agent"
7Pa_Weidt08,Didn't The Live Action Hybrid Thing Die In 2013 Wih Another Sony Animation Movie: The Smurfs 2?
7Pa_Weidt08,From the creators of the Emoji Movie
7Pa_Weidt08,Christ
7Pa_Weidt08,Whats the song?? YT help me out
7Pa_Weidt08,There is a special place in hell awaiting everyone involved with this film. Apart from Daisy Ridley. And Margot Robbie. And Domhnall Gleeson.
7Pa_Weidt08,"If its based on an innocent Children's book, why is this trailer aiming at outgoing party people? It doesnt make sense"
7Pa_Weidt08,Somebody get Andre the black nerd to do a reaction to this trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,WHY SONY?!!! WHYYYYY?!!!!!!!!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,"After the Emoji Movie, you'd have thought James Corden wouldn't have done another Sony movie."
7Pa_Weidt08,this looks so good and funny!!
7Pa_Weidt08,This is so incredibly shitty I almost can't believe it... all I can say is I hope whoever pitched this idea gets fired and Sony Animation finally learns that they can't make movies
7Pa_Weidt08,Why. Turn. Peter. Rabbit. Into. A. Alvin. And. The. Chipmunks. Rip-off?!?!?
7Pa_Weidt08,Sorry for double posting but. Seriously? Seriously? Sony what ever your execs are smoking take it the hell away from them. Mr Bean would have had more success heading up Sony pictures over the last 3 years.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well this looks like absolute shite. Why did it have to be Peter Rabbit? It looks so far off the source material, why not just call it something else instead of trying to cash in on a name that you will ultimately just drag through the gutter. Sony WTF are you doing?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Everything about this movie looks and feels so hollow and empty. The Tales of Beatrix Potter were & are such beautifully illustrated and charming books with such really lovely characters, This movie though takes all of Potter's work and discards it as though it never meant anything. This feels like such an insult to Beatrix Potter in the worst way possible. 

Also explain to me why of all the actors that were chosen to voice Peter Rabbit, they went with James Corden? James Fucking Corden. Why? 

Beatrix Potter's works deserve a better adaptation than this."
7Pa_Weidt08,"On the plus side, the world might be on the brink of a nuclear holocaust, so we might not live long enough to see this travesty get a release."
7Pa_Weidt08,Please just go out of business already.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony was it really that hard not do this thing in particular
7Pa_Weidt08,0:03 I lost all hope.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Seriously Sony, what the hell is wrong with you? Stop making movies, this is utter trash. Did anyone working on this movie actually even do a Google search of Peter Rabbit?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Looks Like A Funny Movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,SONY is on a mission to kill cinema.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony needs to f*cking stop.
7Pa_Weidt08,THIS CAN'T FUCKING EXIST!!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,"If you want to see a better adaptation of the books, than watch the Nick Jr. series."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Is it bad that I'm very looking forward for this film?,it's like a modern take of barnyard:the original party animals!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Jesus Christ
7Pa_Weidt08,"goodness, never knew Bill Weasley could holler like that!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Appalling, hateful dogshit."
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter's personality seems to have a wild issue.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony Animation should never have been allowed to touch any of Beatrix Potter's material. Her work has a charm that is completely frickin' destroyed here. If they had not just given into the usual dumb smart-brow story (Hop the sequel), they might have done something worthy, like... Beatrix Potter moves to the Lake District and is drawn into the world of the creatures she meets. Not this crap.

Oh, nice realistic style indeed, but butchered characters. Sony Animation, you're becoming as detestable as Dreamworks!"
7Pa_Weidt08,....................................no
7Pa_Weidt08,My eyes! My eyes! What gave I just witnessed? 🙈😭this looks beyond bad! The spirit of Beatrix Potter has been well and truly slaughtered by whatever monstrosity this is
7Pa_Weidt08,F*** You Sony!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why is there so much hate, its just a quick trailer and I would like to see you all make a movie if this ain't ""good enough"" for you"
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie should be a Nickelodeon Movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why, just why"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Dear Sony I suggest before ruining a beloved British classic you actually spend some time here, we are not America. At least get a British person to write and direct it! Who is this movie for? As you can tell by the comments section, WE ARE NOT AMUSED! Sincerely, everyone in the United Kingdom."
7Pa_Weidt08,No. Just no!
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is based on a story set in the Victorian period, by the way."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony... just stop it! You're always embarrassing yourselves with emoji movies and unwanted Jumanji sequels and now... THIS!
7Pa_Weidt08,This film seems divisive already.
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks really stupid.
7Pa_Weidt08,No. NO! Bad Sony! Very bad sony! You are NOT learning! Shame on you!
7Pa_Weidt08,WHY IS HIS JACKET DENIM!!!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,Not impressed by trailer but movie does have good cast and hopefully whole film isn't as bad as this
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, stop making bad movies :("
7Pa_Weidt08,"Not going to lie.
This actually looks like thier first good film in a while."
7Pa_Weidt08,why is it so... realistic....
7Pa_Weidt08,What if Fantastic Mr. Fox was just worse. A lot worse.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I never thought I'd say this, but Sony just raped my childhood."
7Pa_Weidt08,Song?
7Pa_Weidt08,Ruining what could be a beautiful story with rewriting Peter Rabbit as a party animal... Not impressed. I was about to show my kids but changed my mind after I previewed it. I thought it might be something like The Peanuts Movie that didn't stray too much from the source material. But no this is aiming to inject adult humor into a delightful kid's story. Hollywood needs to stop ruining these beloved stories by making the movie with a fast pace and modern humor just to keep kids and adults attention.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is the very epitome of a zero-sum movie. Sony gets your money, you get nothing. Not a shred of entertainment and 2 hours stolen from your life."
7Pa_Weidt08,Have you come here to dislike? I already disliked.
7Pa_Weidt08,i take it they didn't even read the book?
7Pa_Weidt08,"At first, I thought this looked like a mediocre live action hybrid film, but now that I look at this so called reboot of a beloved children's book, it could be as BAD as the Emoji Movie, no joke, I'm with the crowd here!"
7Pa_Weidt08,James Corden down the rabbit hole along with the tiny talent he keeps company #avoidthisrabbitcrap
7Pa_Weidt08,No. PLEASE NO. Send it back
7Pa_Weidt08,"Thanks for ruining my childhood, James Cobbledick."
7Pa_Weidt08,Is he wearing a denim jacket???
7Pa_Weidt08,What’s the music in background someone tell me
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix would NOT approve.
7Pa_Weidt08,PLEASE KILL ME
7Pa_Weidt08,I just disliked my very first video. Thanks for this great opportunity Sony.
7Pa_Weidt08,So Peters a party boy huh? Beatrix would be ashamed
7Pa_Weidt08,I like the song they use. Anybody know what it is?
7Pa_Weidt08,What were you guys expecting from Sony? Those fuckers won't rest until they rape every property they can get their dirty little hands on.
7Pa_Weidt08,"*Emoji movie comes out 
""Well, it can't get any worse than this"". 
*This comes out 
""I was wrong""."
7Pa_Weidt08,THis is so stupid xD its good
7Pa_Weidt08,my god sony ... you are making me feel ashamed of ever defending Teen titans go. you a fucking awful
7Pa_Weidt08,My heart is broken. All the opportunites this story offers for a beautiful movie and ya'll just ignored all of it.
7Pa_Weidt08,Really enjoying the bastardization of childhood favorites. Keep 'em coming.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well, I thought SPA couldn't keep milking themselves to death, tbh it doesn't look as bad as the smurfs, but the story we're looking at so far is extremely comparable, at least the animated characters look better than the latter though.
Probably going to become a kids flick that umm... Doesn't even show any respect or inspiration to the original books?!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony needs to stop making movies!
7Pa_Weidt08,The worst.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I guess the ""no pants"" joke is getting old"
7Pa_Weidt08,This is terrible.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Hey Sony.  Thank you so much...for taking another beloved childhood memory and ripping it to shreds.
You must have thrown a crap-ton of money at the Beatrix Potter estate to get them to sign off on this travesty.
Shame on all of you.  I hope you lose your fuzzy little cottontails financially."
7Pa_Weidt08,You had me until Sony Pictures Animation
7Pa_Weidt08,i think beatrix is crying right now
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony,can you just stop being Sony for once and do something nice and charming."
7Pa_Weidt08,"this is the worst thing i've seen in the last month
bc there was the emoji movie"
7Pa_Weidt08,is stamp cat the fox because it sounds like him
7Pa_Weidt08,"As much as I love to hear Margot Robbie or Daisy Ridley's voice, or even Sam Neill's appearance, the film kinda ruins Beatrix Potter's legacy for me. Trust me, I loved Peter Rabbit when I was young but this Sony-Columbia-SPA take feels too Hollywood and goes with the style of Alvin and the Chipmunks movies. Also did you know that James Corden is the lead after The Emoji Movie?

Beatrix must be rolling on her grave right now."
7Pa_Weidt08,Peter Rabbit would be wise to stay out of Mr. McGregor's garden. *Peter Rabbit is Sony in this situation and McGregor's garden is the theaters*
7Pa_Weidt08,"SONY! YOU'VE F***ING GONE TOO FAR!

I don't even know where to begin with this!

This is a sin against art!

The Beatrix Potter characters were made to be charming... NOT FUCKING ASSHOLE PARTY ANIMALS!!!!!!

There was a HUGE opportunity missed here! They could have made this movie a collection of stories from the Betrix Potter world! They could have made it in the same art style as Betrix's water color paintings... like these WONDERFUL/BRILLIANT shorts did!

https://youtu.be/fErRjperZiM"
7Pa_Weidt08,I heard Daisy Ridley was in this movie. But I shouldn't waste my time watching it
7Pa_Weidt08,Wish I could dislike this more than once...
7Pa_Weidt08,"First The Emoji Movie and now this abomination?

Starting to see that their cancelling of the Popeye movie was a blessing in disguise."
7Pa_Weidt08,This actually is hurting me right in the childhood.
7Pa_Weidt08,"They couldve taken a page from Paddington. Make it a sweet, nostalgic and warm film that respects its source material.


But nope. They had to make it like HOP"
7Pa_Weidt08,"What have you done to this innocent character? He comes from the Lake District, he shouldn't be a cockney geezer and what kind of corporate meeting did you have that felt inspired to have Mrs Tiggywinkle thrusting! Awful, awful, awful!"
7Pa_Weidt08,What is the song
7Pa_Weidt08,Well this is just sad
7Pa_Weidt08,Expect 90 mins of poop or fart jokes
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie gonna suck...
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is this so bad？
7Pa_Weidt08,Think about this generation's children. When I was younger Peter Rabbit was the best. Now this generation is going to see Peter Rabbit as a party going inconsiderate brat. To shame Sony. To shame
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is terrible 

1.) Peter is a child in the books

2.) mr mcgreagor is an old man

3.) this is stupid"
7Pa_Weidt08,I like his voice in the movie than the tv show's voice.
7Pa_Weidt08,"""Introducing Peter Rabbi- I MEAN HOP 2. Yeah, Hop 2. That's what that really is."""
7Pa_Weidt08,How the hell could they've screwed up something so simple like Peter Rabbit?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Repulsive. I can see the Rotten Tomatoes consensus now: ""Sony's Peter Rabbit fails to do justice to its source material by replacing its timeless charm with an overload of crass and predictable CG animal antics""."
7Pa_Weidt08,"The animation looks so good, yet it's made by Sony 😭"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Visually looks stunning, great animation."
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie based on a book
7Pa_Weidt08,"Basically, Peter Rabbit is a slacker."
7Pa_Weidt08,I was actually hopeful for 13 seconds...and then it got Sonyfied. Why can't they just show classics some respect. I'm actually glad they decided to cancel popeye
7Pa_Weidt08,Ignoring the fact that it's destroying a literary classic by itself the movie looks cute
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony Pictures are not finished with shitting on beloved franchises, I see."
7Pa_Weidt08,I hate every aspect of this trailer. From hearing James Corden's annoying voice to that scene of two characters screaming that is in every awful animated movie ever. Disgraceful.
7Pa_Weidt08,i wish sony pictures would die already
7Pa_Weidt08,This film is a travesty. Beatrix Potter's characters and stories have been loved by generations. This is an insult to her beautiful writing and illustrations.
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is so revoltingly monstrous I can't even wrap my brain around it. Already shaping up to be one of the worst possible pieces of derivative waste ever to be expelled from the cinematic anus. The foulness, lack of effort and nauseatingly unoriginal gags are almost extreme enough to reach transcendence. I think my brain is physically damaged, as in that my neurons have all cried out in a chorus of despair and rage and then committed cell necrosis rather than have to continue functioning. With a bit of luck the memory will fade, but somewhere deep inside the horror will remain... years from now I shall still have nightmares of grotesque unfunny CG creations flapping their mouths and honking out derivative trash while I write in the bed, wishing for sweet death to release me."
7Pa_Weidt08,does anybody know the song? it's the only thing i liked
7Pa_Weidt08,"Who else is fearing for the integrity of their children right now, grabbing their picture books, stealing away their Tales of Beatrix Potter VHSs, finding their stuffed animal, ducking into a bunker and praying to God that their fondest memories won't be spat upon when this movie comes out? ;w; I sure am... TT_TT 
Also, I have one tiny question... WHY THE HELL IS MISTER MCGREGGOR A YOUNG DUDE, AND THE ANIMALS SEEM TO BE THE BAD GUYS!? ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ"
7Pa_Weidt08,This will end up like The Emoji Movie....smh.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ahhh, yes. Another timeless children's book character that has turned into an asshole to appeal to modern audiences."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Please stop making films, Sony."
7Pa_Weidt08,Hope this abomination crashes and burns taking everyone responsible with it.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I started getting worried with the physics of Peter Rabbit's jump off the rock at the beginning were off, it just got worse from there."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is not my peter rabbit ewwwww
7Pa_Weidt08,"James corden is an alright host, I don't watch him personally but WHY did anyone think he'd make a good voice character?!? The animation is alright but this looks terrible"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Generally, is this a parody? It's got to be a parody..."
7Pa_Weidt08,This is actually disgusting
7Pa_Weidt08,thanks for ruining one of the few untouched parts of my childhood
7Pa_Weidt08,"They nailed the look, but completely misunderstood the appeal of the peaceful and charming Beatrix Potter world. Sony Pictures disappoints once again.
Also, James Corden??? Seriously???"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This trailer looks alright, but the ideas that Sony Animation create R just the worst after the Emoji Movie.

Seb Sandford"
7Pa_Weidt08,"_Thank God_ I'm not the only one who's offended by this. Within the first 20-30 seconds I knew something was off... like *what the hell* is this?! Why does everything have to be modernized and made to fit this supposedly ""hip"" formula of what a kids' movie is supposed to be? ...Like nothing in this seems to have anything to do with the _Peter Rabbit_ I grew up with. 🤦😞 Ugh. ..And I was actually really looking forward to this. 😒"
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony....on behalf of everyone everywhere.......please.....stop making movies
7Pa_Weidt08,Cringe
7Pa_Weidt08,But the chart says...
7Pa_Weidt08,This is hellish. Would have loved to see Studio Ghibli do this- with sensitivity and innocence.
7Pa_Weidt08,"🅱️eter Rabbit


-End me-"
7Pa_Weidt08,What on earth? 😲😲😲
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow the animation coordination is awesome!
7Pa_Weidt08,The overly long screaming-at-each-other gag was what earned my thumbs down.
7Pa_Weidt08,#NotMyPeterRabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,"See Sony.
See Sony bomb.
Bomb, Sony, Bomb."
7Pa_Weidt08,I rather watch this over Jumanji.
7Pa_Weidt08,just like Paddington (2014) flim
7Pa_Weidt08,-Hop- Peter Rabbit looks -terrible- great! I'm glad they got -Russell Brand- James Corden to play the rabbit!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow people, it's a comedy, something we are sorely in short of these days, you would prefer movies like IT?
Peter was a mischievous little rabbit running amok in the McGregor's garden (who by the way ate his father) then runs home to his mother to be calmed down by chamomile tea (drugged?), I'll reserve my judgement once it's out and see it entirely"
7Pa_Weidt08,Some things are too good and sacred to be bastardized. Peter Rabbit is one of those things. I hope you guys lose a lot of money and learn a lesson.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Congratulations, Sony. You've fucked up our childhoods once again. Hope you're proud of yourselves."
7Pa_Weidt08,Stop ruining things we love and just make the popeye movie already
7Pa_Weidt08,"thats two, two times Beatrix potter rolled in her grave, ah ah ah"
7Pa_Weidt08,"I think that the HBO's 1990 cartoon version is better than Sony's new adaptation.

P.s. I am proud HBO Channel for their creativity, especially their Peter Rabbit from HBO Storybook Musicals."
7Pa_Weidt08,i personally respect the animation even if it is sony. the models don't look too bad but the way the characters are portrayed makes me physically  ill. They always seem to choose the wrong idea to make try movie on and they make it worse
7Pa_Weidt08,"Okay, I can get behind that it's live-action... but--

1. Why get Sony to do it, Sony's animation is better if the whole film is animated

2. Why not a completely animated movie ?!

3. Why this modernized setting?!

4. Why does this not feel like Peter Rabbit?!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Song from the trailer?
7Pa_Weidt08,"If love and warmth is not going to be put into a movie based on a world that revels in it, why waste the time and money licensing the property? Why? With an original world, you could invent characters, save money, cater to, rather than alienate, your audience, and be free to make your own project. In other words, why take the beautiful world of Peter Rabbit and staple it to this wreck of an idea?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"It's ""OLDman McGreger"" not ""Young good looking man McGreger"" How do you screw that up!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Stop making garbage that panders to kids Sony
7Pa_Weidt08,here comes another failure
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ummm huh? This was NEVER the intention of Beatrix Potter's books. The tone is too modern. Just watch the 90s mini-series, THAT is what she intended."
7Pa_Weidt08,These people took so many childhoods and burned them with no fucks given
7Pa_Weidt08,BOOOOOOO!!! Shame on you Sony Pictures!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,Of course it was Sony Pictures Animation that made this
7Pa_Weidt08,"Me: ""Wait, this is a Sony movie right""
*checks dislike to like ratio*
""Oh, it is"""
7Pa_Weidt08,"Wow, the stories of peter rabbit have beautiful pastoral art and charming whimsical atmosphere. Yet they need to be a campy gounge in cheek 3d garbage fest. Why are studios so obsessed with making 3d versions of peter rabbit?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"It's been a while since I've responded to a movie trailer by saying ""HOW DARE YOU"""
7Pa_Weidt08,"Hey! It's James Corden! The guy from The Emoji Movie? Did anyone watch The Emoji Movie? Anyone?

James Corden, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU! 😤😤😤😡😡😡"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Stop, This is a bad movie, Stop Sony"
7Pa_Weidt08,"What a cynical, zero-effort film based on a classic.

This is why Sony is going under."
7Pa_Weidt08,"What kind of dirt do the makers of this movie have on Domnhall Gleeson to get him to be in this, you think?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Looks like a literal garbage
7Pa_Weidt08,Nothing gets a groan out of me quite like that Sony Pictures logo.  Just please stop.  Spidey deserves better.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Kill me. 

Grabs katana blade from closet

SOMEONE FUCKING HELP ME COMMIT SEPPUKU!!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,DESTROY THIS MOVIE!!!!!! This is the first time ever I've been angry out loud at a film trailer! This film will not do well even with kids! You are destroying childhoods! End it now!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,Good fucking god this looks awful
7Pa_Weidt08,... what?
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh my God... I had to turn it off... This is an absolute travesty.
7Pa_Weidt08,STOP THIS MADNESS
7Pa_Weidt08,"NO NO NO NO NO NO this is not okay! THIS is an insult to Beatrix Potter and the lovable character that Peter is. He is not some obnoxious party bunny. I don't care if they are trying to modernize him. THIS IS NOT PETER RABBIT. Considering what the author had to go through to get her work published, what they are doing with this movie is beyond disrespectful. 😠😠😠😡😡😡 I just took a serious gut punch to my childhood😭😭😭."
7Pa_Weidt08,the animation it's so cutting edge for sure. amazing!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Damnit Sony, why does everything you touch turn to garbage?"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This makes me hate life.

Utter fucking rubbish."
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is horrible, a complete bastardization of the source material.  May the Ghost of Beatrix Potter haunt the soulless bastards who created this."
7Pa_Weidt08,You should hang your heads in SHAME at this monstrosity!
7Pa_Weidt08,Noooooooo! Sony is getting worse
7Pa_Weidt08,"Great, the brilliant minds behind the emoji movie are going to ruin an actual classic character."
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is a disgrace. Sony, this is not the kind of story you make a trendy 2011 film about."
7Pa_Weidt08,No. No. No. You don't get to ruin this aspect of my childhood. Stop. Go make another emoji movie while ur at it
7Pa_Weidt08,Does Sony have some kind of contract with the devil that requires them to produce nothing but garbage films?
7Pa_Weidt08,"0:00 - 0:11 - Wow, they really brought the classic illustrations to life! This could be a wonderful...
0:12 - WHY. JUST WHY."
7Pa_Weidt08,Did you learn ANYTHING from Smurfs?!
7Pa_Weidt08,"First watched the Isle of Dogs trailer looks great
then sees this  ..."
7Pa_Weidt08,Now this is how you ruin your Childhood!
7Pa_Weidt08,"February release and Sony are pretty much two hallmarks of ""quality movie"" right there...lol"
7Pa_Weidt08,"0:57-1:27
............................ okay.... that was funny :)"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Hey a Peter Rabbit movie could have potential
SONY LOGO APPEARS
Oh, never mind then"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Oh no, Sony has done it again"
7Pa_Weidt08,"OH MY GOD, SOMEONE PLEASE KILL THAT THUMBNAIL WITH FIRE!"
7Pa_Weidt08,"And this is by the director of the Annie Remake.  Yea, that by itself should tell you everything about this!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony are you trying to kill your own business or what?
7Pa_Weidt08,From the genius who produced the emoji movie
7Pa_Weidt08,"Maybe you guys grew up with Peter Rabbit, but many people wouldn't even know about it before this movie. The original Peter Rabbit was more a like bedtime story that cannot be turned into a feature film. A new, more exciting and adventurous story has to be invented, so here it is.
Besides, Sony distributes this movie but most of the CG characters and scenes are being created by another studio. Hundreds of people are working days and nights to bring this product to you. Don't just make hate comments that put many people out of jobs.
At least come and see the movie. You'll love the amazing live-action/CG-animated scenes."
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter has just hopped on the Downward Spiral.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Amazing technology alone does not a good film make. 

Ugh, way to rip out the charm of a literary classic. Thanks for another hollow movie, Sony."
7Pa_Weidt08,Ugh I can't stand James Corden
7Pa_Weidt08,"I fucking knew it. The second I saw that shitty style of cgi animation in the thumbnail I fucking knew it would suck. A house party? Fucking seriously?! STOP CHANGING CLASSIC STORIES TO FIT MODERN POP CULTURE!

DO YOU STUDIOS LEARN NOTHING!?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Universal is definitely going to sue you guys.
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony...you really need to start focus testing your scripts before you create movies. You will realize no one wants the atrocities you are producing.
7Pa_Weidt08,And I feel a little funny... I feel a little sad...
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why is Peter Rabbit a party goer and energetic nonce in this? The World of Peter Rabbit is supposed to be charming, endearing and innocent. This is just insulting and sucking everything good about Peter Rabbit out of it. Also Mr McGregor is a young guy? Since when? Does Sony even know anything about Peter Rabbit at all? Mr McGregor is an old farmer with a beard that hates Peter being on his farm. Not a young guy that looks like he's got a degree in teaching."
7Pa_Weidt08,"It’s good until 0:13. The animation is actually kinda impressive, but why is it a live action - animation hybrid? Hasn’t Sony learned their lesson with the first two smurf movies? AND WHY JAMES CORDEN?!?!"
7Pa_Weidt08,Domhnall Gleeson is better than this
7Pa_Weidt08,I like it!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony get out. You're done. Simply done.
TIME TO PUT UP THE FORCLOSURE SIGN"
7Pa_Weidt08,"This movie looks okay... The animation is really good. 
*Realises its being made by Sony*
Oh..."
7Pa_Weidt08,Take something beloved and suck all the charm out of it
7Pa_Weidt08,"Just when I thought The Emoji Movie was the lowest you could sink, you desecrate a literary classic. For shame."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Not gonna, I thought this was a bunny rabbit horror movie"
7Pa_Weidt08,You shoot that fucker. Is creepy.
7Pa_Weidt08,If you're english you'd be understanding of how im feeling right now.
7Pa_Weidt08,"I don't know about everyone else, but this looks like a fun film"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Yet another awful movie from Sony Pictures. Are you guys trying to go into bankruptcy? Ghostbusters (2016), The Emoji Movie, and now digging up Beatrix Potter from her grave and violating her work. Ugh."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Gotta love those Sony execs liking comments such as ""This movie great!"" and removing comments like these.

Wonder how long this will stay up..."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony! I thought you guys learned!! PLEASE JUST STOP!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,"One of the last pillars of my childhood, destroyed."
7Pa_Weidt08,"As much as I remember Peter Rabbit when I was in first grade or something, but this one is terrible. I hope this one bombs at the box office."
7Pa_Weidt08,"They wonder why they lose so much money,"
7Pa_Weidt08,"I was hoping it would be a bit more...emotional, like the World of Peter Rabbit show. Then again, I don't know why they would try to market children's stories toward me, so whatever. I hope kids like it because I really loved Peter Rabbit"
7Pa_Weidt08,"Leave it to Sony to take something that could be a smart and sweet movie and dumb it down to the lowest common denominator.

Sony must be stopped at some point, because I didn't know they were making this and now I don't know what's next."
7Pa_Weidt08,2 complaints 1 peter sounds like an adult 2 bad guys are good guys
7Pa_Weidt08,"Why is Mr.McGregor a young, handsome guy? Why does Peter have to sound like an obnoxious frat boy?"
7Pa_Weidt08,This is a fucking DISGRACE. The film-makers and the Sony execs who green lit this should be put on death row for crimes against humanity.
7Pa_Weidt08,Character designs are impressive but the modern setting is not there for me.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Okay, that last bit with the deer and the car was hilarious though!
""Felix, blink! Blink!""
""Headlights!"""
7Pa_Weidt08,Disagree. This Movie Is Like The Emoji Movie When It's Awful. Is that a yes because I keep seeing dislikes.
7Pa_Weidt08,ehh!
7Pa_Weidt08,At this point i hate Sony more than this movie
7Pa_Weidt08,Nice to see it's been done sympathetically to reflect the gentle nature of Beatrix Potter's storytelling approach...NOT!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,My inner child is officially dead. I'm making funeral arrangements.
7Pa_Weidt08,Animation looks great. Everything else....no.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ya never learn do you SONY
You just...never learn"
7Pa_Weidt08,"To think Walt Disney wanted to do this, but was instead given to R A D I C A L Sony 81 years later."
7Pa_Weidt08,As if we needed more proof that Sony is literally the worst movie studio of all time.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Alright Studios, that's it. You're not allowed to use CGI anymore. That's it. Time out. You have to learn how to make things look good with practical FX again AND THEN maybe we'll give you the keys to CGI back.

This is horrendous. Stop. Please stop."
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh.... of course it’s Sony animation
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well, childhood ruined by Sonny again!  So a young Nice British Rabbit is now a middle aged American man? And no wonder the farmer hates them if they trash his home."
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony needs to stop making movies and stick to making tv's and playstations.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Great Sony, now you are trying to kill Peter Rabbit
Great job at making the animation industry a big joke 😒"
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh god no. It's probably gonna get like 16% on Rotten Tomatoes or something like that bad
7Pa_Weidt08,I enjoyed it
7Pa_Weidt08,"Screw you, Sony. Just screw you. This immediately looks so bad."
7Pa_Weidt08,Has anyone seen my bleach?
7Pa_Weidt08,They're already remaking HOP 2011?
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well, at least the character designs and animation are top notch."
7Pa_Weidt08,Wow. I mean... wow. There is so little effort put into this that it's almost beautiful.
7Pa_Weidt08,Hop 2 looks really good.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Sony, can you all do us a favor and just stick to video games? YOU CAN'T MAKE MOVIES!!!!!!"
7Pa_Weidt08,👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
7Pa_Weidt08,Read the books to your kids and avoid this cinematic suppository like the plague...
7Pa_Weidt08,huhh wtf lol 0:33
7Pa_Weidt08,"You know, when I first heard about this, I had my doubts.  But at the same token, I remained cautiously optimistic when I heard that it was going to be a mostly British cast and that it would have a G rating... And then this came out... I mean... Just why?  I grew up with Peter Rabbit.  I went to Beatrix Potter's house in the Lake District, went to the exhibition in Bowness, grew up with that wonderful, wonderful animated series from the people who made the Snowman!  Why can't they just simply make a movie with the tone of the books?!!?  I mean we used to have children's films that didn't talk down and were sincere in their approach.  And then Shrek came along and every other movie had to follow in its footsteps!!!  Why?!!?  Are people just that worried that children will get bored out of their mind with something that's sweet and gentle without bombarding them without pop cultural references or dated dance numbers?  Is this why movies like The BFG and Kubo didn't perform well at the box office?!!? I apologize if I'm going on a rant here.  But I just hate the fact that something I hold very near and dear to my heart is getting this kind of treatment.  And I know that some movies need some sort of embellishing to work for a contemporary audience, but this just isn't the way!!!  Maybe I'll be proven wrong about this.  Maybe it will be better but this just really dashes whatever hopes I had for this completely away."
7Pa_Weidt08,I am done with Sony Pictures Animation. I'm not going to work here!
7Pa_Weidt08,Someone wants to cash in on Zootopia's success.
7Pa_Weidt08,the voice is just horrible wtf
7Pa_Weidt08,"I'm somewhat oddly compelled by this, but rolling my eyes at the same time. And of course, some popular song had to be the overlay."
7Pa_Weidt08,Why did he have to hurt those birds in the opening scene?
7Pa_Weidt08,Ugh...Daisy Ridley is wasting her time....
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter's ashes are scattering in distress
7Pa_Weidt08,Sony will never learn
7Pa_Weidt08,So freaking Cute.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Remember people, this animation studio made the emoji movie..."
7Pa_Weidt08,"Please stop doing this. WONDERFUL character models and renders, but used so heartbreakingly poorly."
7Pa_Weidt08,The deer tho
7Pa_Weidt08,"I don't get it.

Year...after year...Sony keep releasing the SAME fucking movie. The same flat jokes, bad pop culture references, and bland voice acting. Why? These movies clearly aren't hits."
7Pa_Weidt08,From the studio that brought you the emoji movie. Also the amazing Spider-Man 2 and the 5th wave.
7Pa_Weidt08,you're not in Zootopia anymore boi
7Pa_Weidt08,Anybody who goes to see this doesn't deserve to view films
7Pa_Weidt08,I see that they’re shitting all over my childhood.
7Pa_Weidt08,Holy crap that animation and graphics quality is so realistic
7Pa_Weidt08,CAN SONY ANIMATION JUST GO BANKRUPT ALREADY?!?!?!
7Pa_Weidt08,Song?
7Pa_Weidt08,Cancer
7Pa_Weidt08,This is Live Action Peter Rabbit
7Pa_Weidt08,Treehouse Tv Series Revaled!
7Pa_Weidt08,The World of Peter Rabbit & Friends already exists. Why is this necessary?
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter may rise from her grave and decapitate the director because of this.
7Pa_Weidt08,"No. Not at all. Sony, stop."
7Pa_Weidt08,Still better than The Emoji Movie and The Star combined.
7Pa_Weidt08,Hop 2 looks cool
7Pa_Weidt08,"Beatrix Potter is facepalming right now, I think."
7Pa_Weidt08,Wait the same people who made the emoji movie are making this ? This looks good. Dear god please have a good plot and don't make peter dumb. Amen
7Pa_Weidt08,You know that pig joke would've worked more with a goat. Like that one that was screaming.
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks so dumb.
7Pa_Weidt08,The party scene was funnier in Hot the Trot.
7Pa_Weidt08,Glad I don't have kids...
7Pa_Weidt08,I can hear Beatrix Potter rolling in her grave.
7Pa_Weidt08,What a piece of trash .
7Pa_Weidt08,Head lights
7Pa_Weidt08,Who actually likes this it ruined feel it still. It SO CRINGY.
7Pa_Weidt08,what fresh hell is this shite?
7Pa_Weidt08,"To be honest, the Nickelodeon version of Peter Rabbit was much better compared to this."
7Pa_Weidt08,"People realise this is a kids movie right? They're not making these movies for your childhood nostalgia, they're making it for kids who are probably under the age of 12 so some of you really need to stop acting like it's the end of the world because it's not like the book you read 20 years ago"
7Pa_Weidt08,One of the Juniors first movies and turns into a Sony animation pictures crazy this is crazy just crazy talk
7Pa_Weidt08,"yeah I'm kind of disappointed, they modernized it too much, people just seem to be losing their spirit in filming now a days  and not staying true to the story"
7Pa_Weidt08,I'm actually really excited to see this film
7Pa_Weidt08,No
7Pa_Weidt08,I hope is not bad like hope
7Pa_Weidt08,James corden needs to stop voice acting
7Pa_Weidt08,Lot of boring people afraid of change in the comments.
7Pa_Weidt08,Thanks for ruining my childhood Sony
7Pa_Weidt08,"Song: Portugal. The Man - ""Feel It Still"""
7Pa_Weidt08,No thanks.
7Pa_Weidt08,Domhnall Gleeson can do no wrong haha.
7Pa_Weidt08,Why are so many live action adaptations of kids properties like this? Why does it ALWAYS have to involve animated characters making a man's life a living Hell?
7Pa_Weidt08,i like this song
7Pa_Weidt08,"Ok i thought their  gonna start out like the story based on books, but while im watching it i asked myself one question: what the heck is this? Yep its gonna be one of those movies. But ill still give it a chance."
7Pa_Weidt08,"See's in recommended - Oh No

See's Sony - OH NO

See's trailer - O H  N O"
7Pa_Weidt08,What's wrong with 98 people?
7Pa_Weidt08,Oh god no
7Pa_Weidt08,The uncanny valley....... I see it in this movie.......
7Pa_Weidt08,I like to see this new Peter rabbit movie  in 2018
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks like wank.
7Pa_Weidt08,To all the people saying this looks bad: Remember the first trailer of Paddington?
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter is rolling in her grave
7Pa_Weidt08,I dont know if i can trust Sony again
7Pa_Weidt08,Why is the screaming back-and-forth gag still being used!? It's DEAD!!!
7Pa_Weidt08,So relaxing till 0:12..then the real trailer starts🎀
7Pa_Weidt08,"Looks great.  I remember reading Beatrix Potters books as a kid and thinking ""These books need more drunken partying and wisecracking!""

Though no farting or belching jokes Sony? You're letting us down!"
7Pa_Weidt08,I need that song like rn
7Pa_Weidt08,How did you mess up Peter Rabbit? This is nothing like Beatrix Potter. She would be ashamed of this movie
7Pa_Weidt08,Fucking furries
7Pa_Weidt08,If this was a rated R movie... I'd go watch it... but because it's a kids movie it'll be like Alvin and the Chipmunks....
7Pa_Weidt08,#notmypeter
7Pa_Weidt08,What's the song in the trailer
7Pa_Weidt08,"My childhood is about to be ruined. 

Again."
7Pa_Weidt08,"So this is what General Hux does on his day off, huh..."
7Pa_Weidt08,"This needs to be better than Alvin And The Chipmunks, Hop and The Smurfs"
7Pa_Weidt08,Beatrix Potter disapproves.
7Pa_Weidt08,"Well, we're boned."
7Pa_Weidt08,The animation actually looks good in this
7Pa_Weidt08,Please let this bomb.
7Pa_Weidt08,I like it. xD
7Pa_Weidt08,"These morons still didn't learnt  anything for smurfs 


Crap...😡"
7Pa_Weidt08,"What really makes me upset about this movie is that the character models look good. If Sony wasn't making this movie, it would probably turn out pretty good. The problem is that Sony feels the need to stuff a timeless character with dated references and the most overused jokes out there. Why do these things sell? What is wrong with the mass movie going audience?"
7Pa_Weidt08,The movie looks fun.
7Pa_Weidt08,Those screams were beautiful and kind of musical. :)
7Pa_Weidt08,Wtf happened
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks worse than Alvin and the Chipmunks
7Pa_Weidt08,every animated movie feels skeptical after emoji movie was released
7Pa_Weidt08,this is just bad
7Pa_Weidt08,HOP 2.0
7Pa_Weidt08,Nice to see Hollywood learnt nothing from Paddington.
7Pa_Weidt08,Ele é tipo parente do Roger Rabbit?
7Pa_Weidt08,HOP
7Pa_Weidt08,Today is trailer's day
7Pa_Weidt08,"oh no.
Oh no.
*OH NO.*"
7Pa_Weidt08,"General Hux, why are you screaming?"
7Pa_Weidt08,Nice
7Pa_Weidt08,Make a Knack movie
7Pa_Weidt08,This Peter rabbit as a funny personality
7Pa_Weidt08,"This is like the movie, hop"
7Pa_Weidt08,This looks fun. I'm seeing shades of HOP and Furry Vengeance in this movie.
7Pa_Weidt08,Haha funny
7Pa_Weidt08,This movie looks like it's going to be really good and funny
7Pa_Weidt08,Daqui a 4 anos vou assistir na Sessão da Tarde na Globo -  pode printar.
7Pa_Weidt08,😄😄😄😄👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌
7Pa_Weidt08,Hop?

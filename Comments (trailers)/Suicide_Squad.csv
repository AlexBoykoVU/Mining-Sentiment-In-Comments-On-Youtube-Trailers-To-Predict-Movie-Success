CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide squad is out tommorow,😋"
CmRih_VtVAs,It was perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Most superhero movies are flashy, boring and predicable.
Check Mate."
CmRih_VtVAs,http://chn.ge/2b6JCsK
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm seeing this movie in a few hours and I will judge for myself.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Movie was disappointing, I fucking called it. Anything Zack Snyder is affiliated with is bound to fail. I'm no longer excited for the Wonder Woman nor Justice League Movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wanted to ban rotten tomatoes but ACTUALLY the movie sucks balls. So rotten tomatoes was correct.
CmRih_VtVAs,57 milyonn😱😱
CmRih_VtVAs,You know joker was supposed to be really creepy on set as he didn't brake character
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks awesome to me, can't wait!"
CmRih_VtVAs,pull all trailers together and you have the whole movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,can't believe Ghostbusters got better reviews than this
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC's SUICIDE, this movie is just lazy and so generic! Wake up Warner Brothers you are not doing it right!"
CmRih_VtVAs,SUICIDE SQAUD IS RELEASED OFFICIALLY!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Tonight drops baby tonight is going to be lit
CmRih_VtVAs,se ve buena
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS WAS MADE FOR COMIC FANS. NOT CRITICS.
CmRih_VtVAs,Big shit
CmRih_VtVAs,the trailer is actually better than the movie itself. such a disappointment.
CmRih_VtVAs,This will beat Female Ghostbuster by a mile...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I legit hate rotten tomatoes. They seriously ruin my excitement for so many movies, so much of their critics don't relate to the average audience viewer and his or her opinions about movies. I'm seriously done with that website."
CmRih_VtVAs,Just watch the movie.Will Smith literally owned every scene.Harley was pretty mediocre to the point when she got boring.The other cast members were good.The worse character by far was the joker.He looked like a 25 year old rich guy spending money and having fun. Not a psycho. Batffleck was also good
CmRih_VtVAs,"so i just saw it and i was so hyped for this movie so here is a short review for those who are interested... No real spoilers i think

let me start with the negative shit ..
the movie started great and promising but.. after like lil more than half an hour things started to get predictible and ending was kinda cliché. also many great lines and moments from the trailers where either not even in the movie or just different and those were the things that made the movie so appealing to me. 

now positive 
really liked harley. the audience laughed the most cause of her cuz she was just so much fun. deadshot was also good. now the joker tho, judging from the trailer joker seemed really good and most of the time he was but i just kinda hoped he had a bigger part in the movie. i would tell about harley and jokers relationship but you'll just have to see yourself. (i ship these two btw) 

so yeah the movie was not fully satisfying to me but not really disappointing either most of the time"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warner should present the movies the way the directors wanted it to be presented. They decided to cut BvS and now SS, i hope they release the version of David Ayer"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie was made for comic book fans not for cunt critics who wanna shit on everything they don't like.
CmRih_VtVAs,The most over hyped movie in recent memory failed to deliver. I dunno how they managed to screw it up. Hugely disappointing film. So many unnecessary one liners that make you cringe.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is good actress but she is awful played as Harley Quinn. She couldn't act properly to played that famous character. Movie story and bad choice actors / actresses in this movie too. Everything about movie is awful. This movie need to revamp properly next time with better actors / actresses who would play as characters properly. Anyway this movie and new Ghostbusters movie is god awful and worst in hollywood movies history. Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sadly the movie is getting bad critics... but even if the movie isnt so good, we have to admit: THIS is the best TRAILER EVER!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The joke would be on you when y'all see how bad this shit is ..... 😷
CmRih_VtVAs,Here is your god ( Opens ipad with amanda waller ) AHAHHAHAHAHA
CmRih_VtVAs,If only the movie was as good as this trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,Sadly movie isn't that great as trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,just watched the movie if you think its bad youre missing out on a great movie especially if your a dc fan i enjoyed every minute of the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,one of the best movies ever!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, so after some research, here's the trailer that pretty much made the studio freak out and do reshoots. Don't say it wasn't to add humor. It definitely was as well as action. Also, the team that cut this trailer was an outside hire who were also hired again to MAKE THEIR OWN CUT of the film for test audiences. So basically, there's the original, darker David Ayer version then the crazy zany version with more colors (really, more colors such as titles I think). Also, I read a review that one of the main villains looks like Tony the Tiger..."
CmRih_VtVAs,It's an AMAZING MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,EXCELLENT FILM ! <3 <3 Jared Leto is very very ... very good !!
CmRih_VtVAs,I am 12 and this shit is 15 and I wanna watch it fuck the people whos gonna say no I love will smith great acting
CmRih_VtVAs,"Loved the characters, hated the storyline."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm soo glad t-mobile Tuesdays gave me a free ticket to this. So even if it's bad, at least it was free lmfao 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,im going to see it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait seeing it tonighy
CmRih_VtVAs,How old do u have to be to watch it ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"the worst superhero movie !!!!! 
Jamais je n'ai été autant déçu par un film ! 
Pire que Batman vs Superman. Plus jamais je n'irai voir un film inspiré d'un comics ou un film avec Wil smith"
CmRih_VtVAs,God I'm gonna have a really hard time not watching this until Tuesday. It's pretty much my life purpose right now.
CmRih_VtVAs,TOMORROW IS THE MOVIE AAAAHHH CANT WAIT SO EXCITED!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still giving this movie a chance...I admire to actors' guts to screw off the critics
CmRih_VtVAs,"what... have... you...done......... please...
The worst DC film ever :'("
CmRih_VtVAs,Pure editing perfection.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Saw it last tuesday. Harley, Enchantress and Deadshot are nice, croco is fine, didn't like the joker. The cameo is cool.

The movie itself isn't downright bad, but it is sort of chaotic, going from one scene to the other without real connection between them, it show that there was reshoot.

 Still, there are some cool scenes, a few funny ones, not best super hero movie of the year by far, but should still be watched by fans of the genre."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm mad because from what I hear is that they removed some awesome joker scenes . Also don't call a movie trash just because others say it is. I trust more YouTube review more than websites like Rotten Tomato or what ever . The problem people have with this movie is they wanted some characters to have more screen time,but other than that it was good"
CmRih_VtVAs,wait it said worst hero's ever? THERE BETTER THAN THE OTHER SUPERHEROES IN MY OPINION
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can somebody tell me what was the 2nd song used at the ending credits, after Heathens??"
CmRih_VtVAs,This was uploaded on my bday!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie sucks dick
CmRih_VtVAs,soo this got horrible reviews whut the heck
CmRih_VtVAs,Best film ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want to be this Harley Quinn for Halloween,just with longer shorts.But I do want to buy a baseball bat and draw all over it with sharpie so it is like her bat.And of course my mom we order her daddy's little monster shirt.Cant wait til Halloween."
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Karen Fukuhara, and David Ayer must regret getting those 'Skwad' tattoo's right about now*"
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the age you need to be to go to the cinemas and watch it ?? Xx
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody for this whole trailer=GENIUS PURE GENIUS!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this could be better than the dark knight
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,So is the movie good or bad?
CmRih_VtVAs,that girl is jinx
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't WAIT FOR THE MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,Этот Трейлер лучше самого фильма
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope the movie is good. I've heard a bunch of people giving it bad reviews already!
CmRih_VtVAs,Killer Croc #1!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""This movie is gonna be so awsome I mean just look at the trailer it's perfect and I know the other 2 dc movies had awsome trailers and turned out medicore at best but this is gonna be different""
-Some fanboy with unrealistic expectations who doesn't even listen to reviewers"
CmRih_VtVAs,haha this movie sucked.
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the movie.awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"f*ck rating,this movie is amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the best film i've ever seen in my life!OMG HARLEY QUINN IS JUST AMAZING,THANK YOU MARGO,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HARLEY QUINN!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's sad because Finding dory got a way better review 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Well today's the the day I hope the critics were just being ass holes
CmRih_VtVAs,ok even with that hair color and shit i 'm in love with margot robbie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer was epic and I thought so would be the movie... The Hard Truth: IT DIDN'T! You're breaking my heart DC and Warner Bros. 2 Flops in a row now! Pull your shit together and give us a ""FILM OF A LIFETIME""! Cara Delevingne did a good portrayal by the way..."
CmRih_VtVAs,tomorrow i m going to watch first day first show in India very exited about it...
CmRih_VtVAs,1:38 what's that song?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:45   What's that song??
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like it will be a good movie, I have no interest in Suicide Squad, don't care about the characters, couldn't care less about what actors are in it but I think it will just be a fun movie.  I won't see it opening night but will see it at some point in the theatres.  What I do find interesting is how shocked people are that Will Smith is in it...... I mean people know Will and JPS have an open marriage right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's true. The only ones that would benefit from this movie being bad are those butthurt fucks that think Hollywood is producing way to many superhero/anti-hero movies.. 

Those fucks just want to see the same old fucking love drama bullshit.. They still produce a lot of those movies. It's just that superhero movies get the most attention."
CmRih_VtVAs,the dialogue was corny as hell
CmRih_VtVAs,"i didnt enjoy watching the movie because most of the trailers fucking spoiled the punchlines and the good parts, the rest was just cringy and clichè."
CmRih_VtVAs,ROTTEN TOMATOES i know u were right with how BVS sucks ass but after watching this movie i realize what a complete trash u are mothafckers!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just watched it on a Midnight Premier. Don't know why rotten tomatoes rated it so low, they must have Mickey Mouse sucking their own dicks..This film was freaking awesome!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck rotten tomatoes. Absolute twats trying to ruin the film we've been waiting for. People have waited God knows how long for such a masterpiece and here goes rotten tomatoes and fucks it all up
CmRih_VtVAs,Came here for Harley Quin
CmRih_VtVAs,ive watched dis movie @ its really great
CmRih_VtVAs,Film sucks fucking ass man oh my God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's horrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara's dance while channeling her spell lol
CmRih_VtVAs,only 1 day left fuck i can hardly wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see horrible reviews about this, but it says the movie doesn't come out till tomorrow. I'm looking at the showtimes in my area and they're all in the evening. Wtf is going on here."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody. hook my memories
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cinemex no distribuira su pelicula, todos los cines cercanos son cinemex y no viajare 6 horas para ver esto, lo vere pirata ustedes saben por que cambian sus contratos! que mala onda yo los queria."
CmRih_VtVAs,It was amazing...
CmRih_VtVAs,I am way too hyped for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Guarantee you it's fucking shite.
CmRih_VtVAs,"good diolog, acting, but REally bad story...huhhhh"
CmRih_VtVAs,"A cool plot-twist would be if almost in the end, Joker turned up against  his teammates just for the sake of fun."
CmRih_VtVAs,tom hardy will fit perfectly in this group
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG I SO WANT TO SEE THIS

BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY JUST MAKES THE WHOLE THING AWESOME XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Seriously Why Isn't Deathstroke In The Suicide Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,just going to watch right now
CmRih_VtVAs,1 more day!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Ohhh man I just watched this movie...can't wait for the reviews on this..
CmRih_VtVAs,welcome to the dark side of movies...
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone is saying its bad based on other people's opinions?? You're all dumb.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the last song
CmRih_VtVAs,"Without spoiling anything, i have to say that the end fight scene was a complete masterpiece! with all of joining to fight together and the close ups of that final bit was awesome. absolutely beautifully shot, like the camera shots, the slow motion and the quality and the soundtrack just all went perfectly and it was honestly one of the most beautiful shot scenes in the movie/cbm"
CmRih_VtVAs,Just watched the film and I enjoyed it. I'm starting to feel that Marvel is paying Rotten Tomatoes to give DC low ratings lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ooh! who's that girl in the Red 😍LOVE HER TASTE MUAH ~
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is better than the actual movie
CmRih_VtVAs,orayt bohemian raphspody my favorite song
CmRih_VtVAs,OPEN THE GATES - trick2g <3
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone know the title of song when harley jumps into the vat then joker jumps aswell?
CmRih_VtVAs,i loveeeee harley!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"slipknot dies first,out."
CmRih_VtVAs,"just watched the movie! giving rate 7/10, their enemy not legit , and their mission was so lame! im expecting more ! :("
CmRih_VtVAs,"guys, the movie is not even out yet. instead of listen to other people's idea, we should form our own AFTER watching the movie. these type of negative judgments really are not fair to anybody."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does this movie remind me of Saints Row 2?
CmRih_VtVAs,Screw all of you haters! This movie looks amazing!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,So after justice league are they going to do suicide squad vs justice league ??
CmRih_VtVAs,"A third of the comments:Rotten tomatoes
Another third:Oh no, superman vs. batman
Last third:Fuck the critics 
Ok you haven't watched the movie yet, so you don't know how good it is yet! It's just like svb, the trailer was good but the movie was so fucking bad"
CmRih_VtVAs,What's it rated
CmRih_VtVAs,33% on Rotten Tomatoes BUT 7.8 on IMDB. Best bet is to see it if you want to and make up your own mind.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is amazing. movie is excellent. soundtrack is wonderful. jared as joker is one of the best things i've ever seen in a movie and anyone complaining about him being there only for few moments - his character is so powerful that if he was there the whole movie, we wouldn't notice anything else. i think the amount of his appearance was perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,The actor that acts as joker is dead. He commit suicide because people said his role was scary. That's what people told me. Please comment on this post if I'm wrong and tell me the right answer
CmRih_VtVAs,"The acting was brilliant, by everyone. But the movie is terrible. Way to cgi heavy. Over done action. Focus on the characters. Have people fighting people , watching these guys fighting a good like character with 12 year old cgi was so disappointing. And the plot was ridiculously predictable:( first 30mins and small parts in the rest were awesome. But 2\3rds of this movie killed it as a film"
CmRih_VtVAs,Soesaijt skwat is betesss ermahgerd!!!! ;>
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen made it 100X better
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is AWESOME!!!. Better than Captain 3. FUCK YOU ROTTEN TAMATOES, FUCK YOU ROTTEN TAMATOES, FUCK YOU ROTTEN TAMATOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Slipknot was great in the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't care what the score is on Rotten Tomatoes. I was hyped for this movie, I'm still hyped and I'm going to go watch this movie over the weekend and judge for myself."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG THE MOVIES COMING TOMORROW I'M SO HYPED
CmRih_VtVAs,FFS! Why the hell is trailer better then movie? Why??
CmRih_VtVAs,"After just coming back from seeing this, I felt as if the reviews it got were extremely harsh... I did notice scenes shown in trailers did not make an appearance on screen and the plot was honestly a mess... It could have been so much better, it had so much more potential. And I feel as if that's the reason why this movie got the bad reviews it did. Very harsh in my opinion. On the positive side the characters were great as well as the effects throughout the movie. I enjoyed it but the plot could have been better."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie managed to get even worse critical reception than Batman Vs. Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn makes me gay
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,rotten tomatoes is soooooooooooooo on point with this one....overpaid waste of space actors and rubbish movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched this trailer waaaaay too much
CmRih_VtVAs,What was the book harley quinn reading at 2:31?
CmRih_VtVAs,What was the book harley quinn reading at 2:31?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to watch this tomorrow in 3D.
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought Joker were in the team
CmRih_VtVAs,My God you DC fans are hard to please.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Waited for this for 6 months, it's fucking worth it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith a super villain? Seriously? He has the cleanest image out there. When he was a rapper he couldn't even bring himself to curse. He has no range as a bad guy. Might as well cast Kevin Hart.
CmRih_VtVAs,wana hear a joke... diablo dies
CmRih_VtVAs,"uh so, is this its own company? like its ""heroes"" is it dc comics? image comics? valiant comics? charlton comics?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"the trailer and movie direct by different director right? 
who makes the trailer?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Disappointed...
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck the 31% from rotten tomatoes.  They gave you a movie just fucking enjoy it
CmRih_VtVAs,Give mr joker a long scene  at next movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I love when Joker jumps after Harley to rescue her.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Watched it, awesome movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The movie was really good! I saw it yesterday :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now I'm really scared of the critics when DC movies come out...

I read the reviews and I ended up ranting so loud to my classmates.

Still gonna watch it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's play a little Bohemian Rhapsody gentlemen...
CmRih_VtVAs,A very poor movie. Did not meet my expectations. All I can say is they better not screw up justice league or wonder woman. SMH right now...
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVER!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer was better than the whole movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's watching tomorrow?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,The sad realization that the trailer was better than the  movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,definitely gonna watch it whether its o% rated by any movie critics
CmRih_VtVAs,"batman v superman sucked ass.
but will smith is in this movie so what could go wrong?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Worth every penny... I've watched it
CmRih_VtVAs,"one of the worst movies I ever saw. I just felt ashamed when watching for everyone else that was going to pay money to see this. the editing is worthless, there's no story whatsoever, the ""bad guys"" are hilarious (not in a good way). this trailer really is the best thing about the movie, don't waste your time on this one, thank me later."
CmRih_VtVAs,rad homielicious
CmRih_VtVAs,meh..
CmRih_VtVAs,slipknot dies at the start of the movie XD his head explodes :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Jared Cara Jared Caraaa 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"awesome soundtrack  check

this is gonna be epic ughhh I can wait to watch it!!! !"
CmRih_VtVAs,my media studies class is watching this on Monday 😀
CmRih_VtVAs,i love the way she bend
CmRih_VtVAs,And this is how you get people hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,"It would've gotten better reviews if only the critics would STOP trying to size it up to whatever Marvel releases. Watch it for what it is, not for what it's NOT. Stop watching this movie with Marvel in mind. Go watch a Marvel movie if Marvel is on your mind."
CmRih_VtVAs,I HAVE THE SEEN THE MOVIE AND I THINK WE OWN ROTTEN TOMATOES A HUGH APOLOGY
CmRih_VtVAs,Slipknot dies
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear I watched this movie it was amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Just saw this movie a day early and it was amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll die to watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,I just watched this movie in the theatre. Don't trust the critique too much THE MOVIE WAS GOOD if not better than most of the marvel films
CmRih_VtVAs,"just came back from cinema... watched it. enjoyed it. 
can't wait for the next comic movie :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow people in comment section are really dumb
CmRih_VtVAs,Has anyone seen it yet?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Supposedly the Joker is hardly in it. Jared Leto even said alot of what was filmed with the Joker ending up being cut. That really sucks, I probably won't see this movie  anymore for that reason until it's out on Blue-Ray."
CmRih_VtVAs,Witch one of you little rotten tomatoes ass holes disliked this 13000 times? Fucking douche bags!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,i just watch it and it was awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,ahhhh I wanna see it so bad but idk if my mom will let me !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I saw the movie last night it was pretty awesome 
 but the play role about the jokr I wished will go to James Franco OR Jake Gyllenhaal
but no it goes to the fuc. face and he ruined it"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who should we trust more. Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb
CmRih_VtVAs,"Going through the comments just put the excitement of seeing the movie into the ground. If you think it was bad then fine, but please just keep the criticism to yourselves. Let us decide if it's good or not."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how I've NEVER heard about this till now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Got to see this movie early with my friends on Monday... It was the best movie I have ever seen! Watch for the pink unicorns😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck the critics! this was an awesome movie!!
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,You know I probably could put most of the movies together with all the trailers 😆
CmRih_VtVAs,I was fucking sold once i heard bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Great trailer it's about time Warner Bros. and DC learned how to market their movies!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,movie is Amazing harley hero
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hahah 31% rotten tomatoes. New York Times said this movie was ""bad. Just straight up bad. You could go to the claw machine during the fight scene and not miss out on any action"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Will looks so not like him!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Just saw this today... money grabbing piece of shit. Please dont go see it guys ffs what a let down. Every Joker scene is in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm watching this next week with the boyzzzz
CmRih_VtVAs,"all you people believing the reviews of a website are a bunch of idiots, and I take pride in saying this, believe all the bullshit you like, I'm still gonna have fun with this movie :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I see so many people putting these to other songs and I'm just wondering why NO ONE has compiled any to 30STM. Battle of One would make a great video...js
CmRih_VtVAs,love this song what it called
CmRih_VtVAs,Rotten tomatoes. Farce awakens 80 something percent. Attack of the clones 63 percent. Crystal skull 73 percent. Ghostbusters 73 percent. In what universe does that website have any validity?
CmRih_VtVAs,These guys will make tons of money regardless of your petty opinions
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else notices on the there merch the joker is never in it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow....ok I  have predicted BvS to suck. (I haven't seen the Suicide Squad movie yet) Now like a person who knows that something really bad is about to happen like a plague or an atom bomb going off in the city; I say this one is going to suck too.  Had that feeling when the first advertisements came out for Suicide Squad. Yes I've read the Rotten Tomatoes reviews: it made me laugh. At least I won't be surprised when I see this movie,  or maybe I will: I'm pirating it, I do not trust  DC movies with anymore of my cash. Oooh that sounded mean but that's what is my mind set about DC movies. "
CmRih_VtVAs,Is anyone else rlly attracted to joker? Or is just me lol
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,33% i dont knoooooow 😞

CmRih_VtVAs,34% already and it hasn't even officially come out yet.

CmRih_VtVAs,So wanna watch this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else is here after watching FaZe Adapt
CmRih_VtVAs,I only wish Heath Ledger was the Joker!!!  RIP HL.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so awesome  and it has several strong female leads.  I love it.  100% better than female ghostbusters!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,sucks. sucks so much!
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even know who Harley Quinn is but she is badazz and I love when she smashes the window and gets the little purse.

CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is going to steal the show.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara baby 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just saw the film and I got to say that it was not a complete disappointment, but I was really hoping that this film would be much better. I think that Margot as Harley was one of the few good things about the film. Her performance was extraordinary. Will and Viola were also pretty decent, but nothing more than that. The film started really well and I was excited at the beginning but from there it just went down. ""One step forward, two steps back"" would be the best description. I think Ayer (director) was more concerned to make his childhood dream come true, as he said at SDCC, than actually make a quality, exciting and fun plot that everybody was expecting. And do not even get me started about Enchantress. She and her brother( which was the most confusing character in the picture) looked like a modern remake of The Mummy. Jared Leto as the Joker, was the most  anticipated character and all we got was extended cameo. From what I have seen, he looked like he was trying too hard, but I do not want to criticize him because it is hard to play the Joker after Heath Ledger spoiled us all with his astounding performance in TDK. Overall, if you are DC fan you should certainly watch this movie, but I am sure  you will notice that it could have been made better than it was and that the members of the Squad, beside Harley and Deadshot were not given much attention."
CmRih_VtVAs,All these people saying the movie sucks but haven't even seen it yet. Stop going off what other people are saying and form your own opinion you followers.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker is barely in it? WTF
CmRih_VtVAs,"""FUCK ROTTEN TOMATOES 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾- ROT IN HELL YOU SCUMBAGS TRYING TO RUIN MY FUN WITH ALL YOUR PATHETIC REVIEWS"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Trash
CmRih_VtVAs,Simply amazing - I just came out of theater here in Paris - There was a standing ovation - literally everybody was standing up in applause.  I must say this Joker is crazier than Heath ledger joker - I need a leather jacket and a gold chain honestly he's has too much swagger.  This movie is for Millenials old peoples wouldn't understand - 👊🏾💸🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾👑💰💰💰💰💎💎🔮⚰💉🔑🗝🔪☠ fuck that suicide squad is the Ish fuck the reviews whoever wrote them might be old too.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Like I'm gonna pay attention to rotten tomatoes ratings! They only have idiots rating there!! daredevil has a higher rating than bvs , you know it's a bullshit website!! I stick to imdb!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I've already pre-ordered my tickets bc I've been waiting for this movie since it was announced. I'm just praying it's good bc of the hype
CmRih_VtVAs,Wtf lol
CmRih_VtVAs,All that bs from Jared Leto for a year and he's barely in the movie. Either he was edited out of scenes or they lied to us from the start.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is reality, superheroes don't really come to help, supervillans get annoyed af and just help out I guess, idk what I even said 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,joker dies in suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE WAS FUCKING AMAZING. I saw it today and oh myyyy i've found my new fave movie!!!!!!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,"The design of ""suicide squad"" is sexy ass hell"
CmRih_VtVAs,More Hollywood trash.
CmRih_VtVAs,"No matter how the actual movie does, this will always be my favorite movie trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,This comes out on my birthday
CmRih_VtVAs,"If tomorrow, the critics tell that an Independance Day sequel or a Ghostbusters sequel is pure shit nobody panics, because it's all ""part of the plan"". But when the critics say that one little new DCU movie and very anticipated Suicide Squad sucks as hell, well then everyone loses their minds!

Oh sorry wrong movie/universe."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great, now I cant listen to Bohemian Rhapsody without that turgid movie Suicide Squad coming to mind..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking ruined Bohemian Rhapsody forever

CmRih_VtVAs,That was one of the best movies i have ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,Maybe this is a copy of Deadpool because it says that they are the worst heroes ever and you know Deadpool its the same only is best
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh this shit is going to be bad ass good
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me why the reviews are so bad? Like it can't be that bad...

CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like they forgot Diggle...
CmRih_VtVAs, Enchantress its the real villian
CmRih_VtVAs,"Where are comments like ""Marvel is sh*t"" now? :) :("
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel if they put deadpool in it the movie would be  so much better I mean he fits the role he isn't a hero he's an antihero and he's funny come on..but then again dc did this soooo...
CmRih_VtVAs,Tmobile gave free tickets so I'm going
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh glamorizing mental health issues again, yay hollywood"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks fucking stupid...
CmRih_VtVAs,mierda
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, Don't bother looking at the comments.. They will let you down some people will say ""this movie was sh*it or this sucks. I was so excited for the movie but the comments will let you down tbh.. ps WTF IS WRONG WITH ROTTEN TOMATOES LIKE OMFG"
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY !
CmRih_VtVAs,"Aaaaaaaand it sucked. What a freeking surprise.. 
It must feel good to be a freeking tool boyz:P"
CmRih_VtVAs,Rest in peace slipknot 
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 hold on let me have a drink before watching the rest of the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like the movie , I wished they sticked  to the old Harley Quinn Costume"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg I love Harley wuinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"We did say, Warn a Brother!

This is where we get to say, we told you so!

Hahaha"
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this song
CmRih_VtVAs,It was pretty obvious the movie would be pg13 as soon as I saw fucking will smith. I'll be reminded to be good every scene he's in.
CmRih_VtVAs,shout out to queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best trailer ever, this is my fav song😄"
CmRih_VtVAs,How can this only be at 35% on rotten?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie was amazing. I wasn't actually expecting it to be good at all ever since I saw the ratings, but honestly I have to say I enjoyed every single minute of it. DON'T RELY ON THE CRITICS GO WATCH IT YOURSELF AND JUDGE!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great idea super Villains becoming SuperHeroes
CmRih_VtVAs,Watched it.Joker is the worst part of the movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,What age rating is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN WAIT IT COMES OUT ON FRIDAY

CmRih_VtVAs,Hahaha Harley breaks the glass just to get a purse
CmRih_VtVAs,All these negative reviews are crushing my heart </3
CmRih_VtVAs,it seems we've all seen all of the joker in this movie from the trailers which sucks but in my opinion leto pulls it off need the Jman and  Harley  to appear in batman standalone
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot as Robbie is what's gonna make this film good.. I was always a fan of Dc (FUCK MARVEL)
CmRih_VtVAs,It's a shitty version of Deadpool.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Gangster - Jack Nicholsons Joker
Anarchist - Heath Ledgers Joker
Psychopath - Jared Letos Joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,All the jokers are different. Jack Nicholsons joker was the gangster. Heath Ledgers joker was the anarchist. Jared Letos joker is the psychopath.
CmRih_VtVAs,Pathetic movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""There's a sucker born every minute."" P. T. Barnum... and most of them are at Comic Con... it won't matter HOW BAD the reviews are you suckers will still pay to see the fascist superheroes. Come on... what did you expect? Kubrick?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate how critics can get the movie early
CmRih_VtVAs,hablan español?
CmRih_VtVAs,SHITY MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"cmon DC, when you will get serious?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait 💖

CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith's gonna ruin it
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the Ezio Part!
CmRih_VtVAs,Two things: this trailer gives me LIFE & Harley Quinn is my spirit animal. Therefore I will be embodying her for Halloween 🤘🏻🙄🤘🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name of the song in the mimute 1:40
CmRih_VtVAs,"Les gars je viens de voir le film, si jamais vous hésitez à aller le voir je vous conseille (ca fera du bien à votre portefeuille en plus) d'attendre de le voir en streaming !!!
Franchement je suis pas du genre à cracher sur les dc mais là c'est le plus gros navet que j'ai vu, limite pire que les marvels et pourtant il en faut pour faire pire ! Entre un joker fragile qui ne sert à rien dans le film, des doublages et dialogues cul-cul la praline et l'histoire et sa crédibilité nul à chier, le seul truc bien dans ce film c'est le cul de celle qui joue Harley Queen et Will smith qui joue à peut près bien son personnage.. Franchement pour une fois les critiques officiels disent vrai, c'est un film nul de chez nul, pourtant je le répète je suis pas trop difficile avec les dc que j'aime plus que la plupart des marvel."
CmRih_VtVAs,https://www.change.org/p/rottentomatoes-com-shutdown-rotten-tomatoes
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE LOOKS SO EFIN RETARDED.
CmRih_VtVAs,All the fanboys bitching about how critics have a negative bias towards DC movies need to get a grip. Remember how much critics loved the Nolan Batman trilogy? The new DCU has just sucked so far..
CmRih_VtVAs,DC movies under Zack Snyder are failing bring Christopher Nolan back!
CmRih_VtVAs,:') I'm crying internally....the tomato score was disappointing...I had my costume ready for the premier too...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just watch it today, and enjoy it..."
CmRih_VtVAs,JUST WATCHED THE MOVIE : HANDS DOWN THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!! 😍🙏🏼 IT WAS SOOOOOO GOOD SRSLY & I AM IN LOVE W HARLEY QUINN!! <3 SUCH A CUTIE BADASS 💙💗💋 LOVE HOW CRAY SHE IS 👑💘
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not a DC fan but this film pretty good! And I'm falling in love with Jared Leto as Joker! Idk why people don't like him to potray Joker but for me, it was satisfying enough! Hope the rating not as bad as bvs"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Watched this 100,000 times, still getting chills"
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Harley takes purse* ""Were bad guys. It's what we do."" Yes, Harley! I love her (not in the mushy way, chill)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Just watched the movie at the cinema. It was great.
CmRih_VtVAs,I guess the trailer is better than the movie itself.
CmRih_VtVAs,more garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,guess what people... ur fav character slipknot is dead in this movie. arent u gonna cry?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Saw this movie yesterday morning and to be honest, it didn't reach my expectations...Buuuttt the new Joker and Harley Quinn are to die for♡♡"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've seen so many people bash this movie, but there's no way it could be worse than BvS, which is a win in my book."
CmRih_VtVAs,VIP tickets
CmRih_VtVAs,I watch that movie in cenima done
CmRih_VtVAs,I am convince that Critics have it out for DC movies how the hell this movie gets a 5.3/10 SMH every critic who review the movie is a Marvel fan
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously though everyone looks faithful to the comic except for Harley Quinn, why the fuck couldn't she wear her iconic jester suit? I'm sure it would've made Margot a lot more comfortable and not be embarrassed in front of the other members of cast.

Her beauty alone is enough we don't need her looking slutty fuck you Holywood."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is by far the most colourful movie i've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,"fuck you DC. why you ruin this movie. fuck shit!!!!,, joker cameo like a gangster and why you make  romantic movie, WE NEED MORE BLOOD!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Rotten Tomatoes ruins the hype for the movie. Like, come on 33%??"
CmRih_VtVAs,I was having high hopes and expectations for this movie but sadly it doesn't translate in the movie :(
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow~ way to go~ DC comics
This time's definately a solo Home-run indeed ^^/
guys~ don't forget a cookie movie of Bruce Wayne & Amanda Waler.
And Director's cut version that  i saw some outtakes in movie trailers"

guys~ don't forget a cookie movie of Bruce Wayne & Amanda Waler.

CmRih_VtVAs,Stop looking at the ratings! They are just tools used to make a movie look bad or good without even seeing it.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is music at 13.09 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well,lets hope Justice League gets good reviews when its out.

Because the trailer is kinda cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,why cant someone just make dredd 2
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP dc. 1939-2016
CmRih_VtVAs,이 예고편 만든 사람 상줘야한다. 예고편이 제일 재밌음
CmRih_VtVAs,What age rating is this cuz I want to see this in cinemas
CmRih_VtVAs,"Atleast they dont completely destory a whole city, to kill one bad guy and still get called hereos."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, it looks like there will be 2 historic box office drops this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, the critics said the movie sucked smelly balls, Ayer said the critics are dumb, fanboys want to rape the critics.. But you need to be prepared that this indeed is a smoking pile of crap when you see it, just like BVS and Gods of Egypt and the rest of cesspool movies that directors and fans are defending. Just accept the fact that maybe just maybe it didnt turn out how you or anyone else wanted it to be, let it die and move on to another. Hope that Wonder woman or Justice league will be better"
CmRih_VtVAs,"waste of money and fucking shit, soundtrack was the best thing about it. Tried too hard."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v Superman and all its stupidity and pandering to angry 14 year-olds deserved the mockery right from the start, but Suicide Squad was supposed to be the cool one! I hope after seeing it I can disagree with all these shitty reviews."
CmRih_VtVAs,"dc comics is hell-bent on following nolan's batman dark-serious-tone, now it hasnt worked since superman, sVb, and suicide squad it's time that the upcoming movies change it up"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dead shot as Will Smith ..
CmRih_VtVAs,"What a load of crap, is what its come to ? wtf!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it
CmRih_VtVAs,worst movie ever what a fail..Fuck you DC
CmRih_VtVAs,"Going in with the lowest expectation right now (especially after Stuckmann's review), but it's sad that some people won't even go check out this movie that they were excited about because other people didn't like it. Who knows? Maybe you'll love it."
CmRih_VtVAs,I SAW IT TODAY YASSS
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate this Harley Quinn and Joker!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,who is will smith playing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do I want to look like Harley Quinn🎭🎲
CmRih_VtVAs,"Last week everyone was like, this looks amazing lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,"They should make a movie of Red Hood an dthe Outlaws or something :D
Or a real-life series. I bet a ton of people would like to watch that!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys I hate the rotten tomatoes review on this just as much as the next person , but there's so many articles from sooooo many different sites that all say it was terrible and a mess and written terrible . . . . . Idk what to think !"
CmRih_VtVAs,what makes this perfect is QUEEN <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just watched this movie!! Some points that I'd like to point out :

1. Will Smith can't really play a villain character.

2. I love Jared Leto and I appreciate his efforts, but Mr. J in this movie is just a flashy mobster. Isn't he even aware of what's going on aside from picking up his girl? Not very Joker like.

3. Boomerang is useless af.

4. Margot's performance as Harley Quinn is quiet faithful to the comics, I guess?

5. Not very related, but I don't like Ben Afflect as Bruce Wayne, him as Batman is cool though.

However, Suicide Squad is pretty fun and enjoyable to watch. I hope they can develop more engaging characters like in Marvel's Universe."

CmRih_VtVAs,Was the movie really that bad?
CmRih_VtVAs,IVE WATCHED IT AT THE CINEMA. ITS AN AMAZING MASTERPIECE
CmRih_VtVAs,The only good thing about this movie is Margot Robbie.

CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,que carajos tiene que ver bohemian Rhapsody aqui -.-
CmRih_VtVAs,is bohemian Rhapsody for the album by Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,i would love to be part of that team
CmRih_VtVAs,"I saw the movie,and i have to say that it was THE BEST dc movie.Great job."
CmRih_VtVAs,Skrillex made more people watch this than WB
CmRih_VtVAs,That music fits just perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,"*EXPECTATION:* 
This movie's gonna win 5 oscars. Everyone looks effin' amazing in character. Jai Courtney has totally redeemed himself as an actor and will finally break the curse of being a franchise-killer once and for all. Jared Leto is the best Joker ever. 

*REALITY:*
Awww shit.....34% on RottenTomatoes."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley 👑👑👑
CmRih_VtVAs,"spoiler maybe...?





Floyd dies, at least he did in the arrow."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn looks dead near the end
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully this movie would be the best.
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to see it !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG I'm gonna watch it on Friday,ITS SO COOLLLL!!!!!!!😎😎😎😎😅🤑😀😄😊😚😌😂I love it😜😜😜"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, this movie is very disappointing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dreadful first reviews.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's actually very entertaining and fun, it just doesn't break any new ground comic book movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Trailer looks fine but reviews say that is just a reAlly bad movie, (and not bad in the fun way), sexist and boring. So I guess I'm not going at the movies after all."
CmRih_VtVAs,The only thing that makes me suicidal are these toxic comments. Past the bleach?
CmRih_VtVAs,hmm..so this is the last dc movie on this year??
CmRih_VtVAs,Critics were right about BvS.  I wanted to REALLY like it but it was meh.  I hope critics are wrong on this one.  I am looking forward to this one.
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype
CmRih_VtVAs,"i'm scared to see this 35% oh boy, but there was an 8.9/10 one, thats a good thing i guess, if this a mess i am done with dc but i love batman so much and joker and harley, i am scare for this i am going to watch this on sunday..... this sunday i am so nerves"
CmRih_VtVAs,"rotten on rotten tomatoes, well i guess everyone praising this film in the comments is dead fucking wrong. Oh well, it hasn't been the first time they've been wrong *cough* Batman v superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE BOUGT TO BE LIT🤘🏼
CmRih_VtVAs,Name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only reason I'm watching this is cuz Twenty Øne Piløts new song, heathens is in it xD 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLY IS SO ME
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLY IS MY BAE
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MY GAWWWWWD PLLLLLZZ I WANT TO WATCH IT NOW!!! # I'm going to keep on watching the trailer until the movie comes out!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Critics Hate this Movie, yet they give Ghostbusters a good rating? Fuck you Sony, calling people Sexist when they don't like it...."
CmRih_VtVAs,34% 😔
CmRih_VtVAs,Critics might not like it.  But I'm still gonna fap to this.
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't get to see BvS is theaters but I'm gonna move heaven and hell to see this damn it!!! I will see this <.< if its the last thing i do
CmRih_VtVAs,"if the 13 year old idiots would get over the marvel vs d.c. way of thinking, they'd see this movie sucks, plain and simple"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen 💪👍👏👏
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody & Harley Quinn 😍😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,who's ever talking about the critics I feel the same way that they are just hating every DC movie wtf don't go by there review go by yours I think that suicide squad is going to be the best DC movie yet who's with me!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm very obsessed with this movie. I'm buying so much Harley Quinn merch.😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only thing that confuses me is there's Deadshot here in the trailer played by Will Smith but what about the other that was in the TV show, ""Arrow""? Two Deadshots? Is this one canon?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a strong feeling that this movie is gonna suck. I just know it. Margot robbie's charms are the only thing i like about this. Jared Leto sounds like he's gonna copy Jack Nicholson. Also the music just does not fit here.
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto + queen + eminem = 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
CmRih_VtVAs,4 MORE DAYS
CmRih_VtVAs,"I mean, if this is already being called shit, what are the odds of the other movies being successful? Geoff Johns has barely signed on to take control of the universe (in time for Justice League but not for Wonder Woman). I'm getting kinda scared for the latter. I personally didn't hate BvS so I'm sure I'll like this but I'm worried about the effect critical perception is gonna have on the rest of the DCEU going forward."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only person on the planet that thinks this looks really boring? I don't understand the hype. BatVSup. Saw it. Was okay. Cap: Civil War. Saw it. Was pretty good actually. Deadpool...pretty good. Antman. Pretty good. THIS SHIT? It just looks really dull. I hope that I'm wrong.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie seems way better than those lame movies. *cough* batman v superman *cough*
CmRih_VtVAs,Best DC movie of 2016 anyone agree?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like something an edgy teen would make up, especially Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,Alguien habla español?
CmRih_VtVAs,when I close my eyes and listen soundtrack.....why I feel like I hear deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do I feel like the critics are just a bunch of assholes paid to talk trash now?
CmRih_VtVAs,"one reviewer is saying suicide squad is 3 out 10 and gives thor dark world 9 out of 10 really!! you're saying thor dark world is up there with some of cinema's greats!
i thought it was a good joke to wind up marvel fans but i'm starting to believe disney are really buying reviews! mickey mouse with a briefcase doing shady deals"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why are critics so quick to hate on a none marvel movie? I think this movie will be good as hell
CmRih_VtVAs,may i know the song name?the last one
CmRih_VtVAs,el diablo dies
CmRih_VtVAs,"LMFAOOOO i actually feel pretty bad for jared leto, bitch gets so into the joker role that he actually loses his mind, yet the movie's already called shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I waited for this flim from comic-con 2015,and now i can't see it:(("
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm officially convinced that any hardcore DC fan is a Trump supporter. Trying to shut down a website because you don't like their critique? It's their fucking job. There are no under the table deals between Rotten Tomatoes and Marvel and to even say so is extremely childish. Now I still have high hopes for this movie because the trailers were put together flawlessly, but bashing the most successful movie franchise in the world, and yes they beat Star Wars, won't make your franchise any better. Instead of petitioning against something that gives people reviews on movies so people don't waste their time or money, petition for better writers and directors. Don't complain just because Marvel has had its shit together since 2008. No ones out to get DC. They've just yet to have a good movie since Tim Burton or The Dark Knight Trilogy."
CmRih_VtVAs,tô morros ia the Day! my Hearst Will stop
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like a steaming pile of shit tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO FUCKING HYPED

CmRih_VtVAs,when a movie trailer is better than the actual music video
CmRih_VtVAs,yup august 5th ftw
CmRih_VtVAs,Tbh. This looks stupid. Gonna be another fail like bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jeremy Jahns liked it, all other critics dont mean anything"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Considering I completely agreed with the rotten tomatoes score for Batman v Superman, no matter how much I anticipated it,  I can't help but expect the same from Suicide Squad. Such a shame."
CmRih_VtVAs,Just saw it today...
CmRih_VtVAs,37% on Rotten Tomatoes. Time for another round of fans vs critics!
CmRih_VtVAs,"so hyped to see this movie 
:3"
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Jeremy Jahns said its worth buying on Blu-ray so you know it is a good movie!!
CmRih_VtVAs,👎👎👎👎👎👎
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie got 9 on imdb why is everyone saying it's bad?!
CmRih_VtVAs,finally we get a hispanic superhero
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS. IS. AWESOME!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,yo
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS movie is à cancer
CmRih_VtVAs,why arent their the same charactors in the comic?
CmRih_VtVAs,"ITs too early for the reviews to say this movie was Flop!! I'll say FUCK YOU!!!!!!!! Im still going to go watch it so I can get my own opinion about it. Rotten Tomatoes needs to be terminated, they dont know how to rate for shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Rotten tomatoes clearly has something against DC
CmRih_VtVAs,"There was so much hype for this movie that the reviews are probably skewed. While it's probably around a true 60-65, critics went in expecting 80-85, thus giving us the crucifixion of a 33 RT score. Still, doesn't excuse DC/WB execs for the mediocrity of a product that had so much potential......."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Third strike and you're out DC, not going to give you money to make more garbage movies like the past 3 movies.Going to freeboot this garbage"
CmRih_VtVAs,What was that? I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry the voices... I'm kidding! Thats not what they said....
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my God. Critics hate it. DC just can't make a good movie. My sides are in orbit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Another confirmed flop for DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,Seeing it this Friday! Got two free tickets to see it in 3D!! So excited!
CmRih_VtVAs,This film looks fucking awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,also i loved when harley was in her cell at the start lol !!
CmRih_VtVAs,is anyone going to notice the brilliant music choice ???!?!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,IT'S BATMAN V. SUPERMAN ALL OVER AGAIN
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im watching regardless of the critics, but Ive lowered my expectations."
CmRih_VtVAs,The worst super hero ever thing reminds of the comic book guy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"You might say after this movie, DC just committed...suicide."
CmRih_VtVAs,You stopped Queen from playing!!
CmRih_VtVAs,They used Queen in the trailer? This film better be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,is there batman in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Algum Br?
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn critics hatted it
CmRih_VtVAs,33% Rotten Tomatoes..oops who stuffed up this chance at something totaly different
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol fuck what the critics are saying, I'm watching this regardless. So many views have had bad reviews, and I've still enjoyed them. Soul plane for example lol. I thought that was hilarious"
CmRih_VtVAs,SHITTIEST FILM I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE
CmRih_VtVAs,FREE TICKETS ON TMOBILE TUESDAYS
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith back at it again with another bad ass movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"damn this is gona be so fucking bad, another edgy superhero movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,song at 1:22??
CmRih_VtVAs,"To paraphrase from The Wire, I had such fucking hopes for this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now like I said a year ago, Jared leto's performance definitely didn't top Heath ledger's, it wasn't even close. Lol and if any of you say leto's was better than ledger your obviously just a fanboy of Leto"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm watching this omg so cool
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:10
most quotable quote"
CmRih_VtVAs,is it PG 13 in the UK
CmRih_VtVAs,"Rotten Tomatoes can fucking fuck themselves, they are trash, this film of going to slay"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Bohemian Rhapsody but this song did not fit this trailer at all. Not only that but it was edited badly.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ofc she's going to be hypersexualized. what else would you excpet. definitely won't be watching
CmRih_VtVAs,Critics are destroying this movie.And now DC fanboys will come to rescue by saying that critics are paid by Marvel lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,From a critic stand point this movie is meh BUT ITS HELLA ENTERTAINING
CmRih_VtVAs,"All the reviews are in and they are calling this film one of the worst superhero films of all time. Like it is worse than Batman V. Superman.. . I mean seriously DC cant catch a break. 

I'm starting to think that the only way these movies will be successful is to keep with the animated series and move away from live action."
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't have the time to deal with ppl being negative about Suicide Squad. I have been waiting for this for 2 years shut up and let me LIVE
CmRih_VtVAs,"The reviews are in globally (minus America).
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/suicide_squad_2016/
It's shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,8====D
CmRih_VtVAs,RT: 38% fuck(
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else's birthday was 1 August!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've said this so many times, but FUCK. ROTTEN. TOMATOES."
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard it sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,If this movie bombs DC will have a lot of anger and disappointment on their hands.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I saw the movie. and it was just as i expected i told you guys it was going to be bad, it's better than BatvSup but it's still pretty bad. I'm pretty sure all the other DC movies that are coming are going to bad as well, they may as well cancel them if they are going to be as bad as BatvSup and SSquad."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks shit. The soundtrack is honestly terrible. the characters are a joke, seriously there just bad for the sake of being bad, they have no real story line. Harly quinn is clearly supposed to be crazy, but just comes off as an attention seeking bitch. I honestly wanted this to be good. I thought a joker film would be amazing, see his backstory. Find out more about his abusive father.

But nope just changed superhero to bad guy. same bad writing, bad storyline, and terrible characters."
CmRih_VtVAs,To watch batman you need to be caught up on the movies do I need to be caught up on anything if I wanna watch this?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm dying 😱 I NEED TO SEE THIS NOW LIKE NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,reviews not looking to good….Marvel will always win

CmRih_VtVAs,LOVE Harley's hair
CmRih_VtVAs,Hahahaaaaaaaaaa TRASH!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,would be over two thirty hours !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"And yet another piece of shit movie from WB and no one should be surprised. Who knew it takes more than flashy trailers and bankable actors to make a good movie?

LMAO this is actually sounding worse than BvS. Good job guys!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is now getting worse reviews than BVS. What the heck is DC/WB is doing? Y'all are just trying to grab the audience with trailers, but when the movie comes out its HORRIBLE. DC/WB STOP MAKING BAD DC MOVIES. You guys are ruining the DC cinematic universe. You might as well sell the DC Cinematic universes to Disney and let them get the job done."
CmRih_VtVAs,reviews are coming in they don't look too good...
CmRih_VtVAs,"it sucks how many people don't know queen Ummm what song @1:30 its mother fucking another one bites the dust,we are the champions,saviors and princes of the universe,dont stop me now Queen so get your head out of that big bottomed girl and pay attention! because i've got not time for losers! ................ er fuck what's the point, this gonna fly over half of people on here'!  they probably think im talking about fucking royalty!"

CmRih_VtVAs,The music made this trailer awesome :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:38 katana's eyes
CmRih_VtVAs,"All I see is glorification of rebellion, violence, bad rolemodels and sin again. Kinda like the world/society is. It's not my kind of entertainment."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is Bae <333
CmRih_VtVAs,so the suicide squad is teamed with the jocker

CmRih_VtVAs,"""Bohemian Rhapsody"" for this trailer, ""Ballroom Blitz"" for the other trailer....do they have a third version that uses ""Dream Weaver"" to make a triple play pilfering the ""Wayne's World"" soundtrack?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw it at the premier in NY last night.
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is gonna be epic⚡️
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not Gunna Lie , looks Lame and Over Hyped."

CmRih_VtVAs,honestly my only problem is why deadshot black. im sick and tired of blackwashing or whitewashing characters in comic movies. why cant they just stick to the fucking original race.
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad Mark Hamill is not the Joker.  He is the best Joker.  Another miscast character.  The first Ben Affleck as Batman and the second Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther
CmRih_VtVAs,Seppuku Squad is an amazing anime

CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad Joker is only in it for 20 minutes.
CmRih_VtVAs,If this is not the most bad ass epic trailer than what is
CmRih_VtVAs,"Develop an action game for Suicide Squad for PC & Consoles, we will say yes definitely"
CmRih_VtVAs,"yo, Harley quinn is fine"

CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm really pissed off that it's a 15. Me and my friend were planning to go see it  (we're 12) and I've been a big fan of DC, Warner Bros., Marvel and all the the comic books to go with it. When I found out Harley Quinn was in it I went crazy, I love Harley Quinn and when I first found out about her I wanted to be like her. Then I found out this movie was a 15 and I'm really annoyed. Can't believe this movie is a 15 and not a 12A."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is there anything in the world better than a sexxxy af female villain?
(That's a rhetorical question, the answer is obviously *_NO!FUCKING!WAY!_*)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Deashot:* Played by Will ""Always Plays Himself In Every Movie"" Smith. 
No one asked for this. No one.
Who wants to see a 50 year old Deadshot? Just wondering....anyone??
The rest of the cast seems almost perfect, tho. 
Especially the girls. Yummy."

(See what I did there?) 😄 😏 🃏☠💯"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it just me...or do Margot Robbie 😲, Cara Delevingne 😲, and Karen Fukuhara 😲 all seem 10x more *(sexually)* appealing as villains? 
I can't even say which one I think looks the most edible here. As far as I'm concerned, it's a 3-way...dead even."

CmRih_VtVAs,*hello*
CmRih_VtVAs,I dont know about how they portray Harley Quinn.... her history is way more sinister than the light bubbly crazy I see in this trailer. Hopefully they do her character justice. Can't wait to see this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't think The Joker will have many scenes...if not..I'm going to be sad 😢
Joker and Magneto are the best villains by far!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Just 3 more days yes!!!!!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly. You can't have an awesome trailer like this and have it be a shitty movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"slipknot is dying first, i call it"
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like this movie will go down in history as the most overhyped stinking rotten tomato EVER!

CmRih_VtVAs,Team Harley.  She's my kinda Crazy =)
CmRih_VtVAs,I like this is the suicide squad alpha 101.
CmRih_VtVAs,Zabawa :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guysss it's what we do :D"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Smallville"" started this"
CmRih_VtVAs,I would see this movie if Jared Leto wasn't in it. I wanna see a movie where MCR are secretly super heroes. Gerrard Way ftw!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:47 Finnicks death scene
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the official song
CmRih_VtVAs,I ten years old and I wanna watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Would love to see a sequels do Nightwing, Batgirl, Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy true justice. Hoping this one is great enough for that too happen."
CmRih_VtVAs,Music?
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie would be good if they had a better joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's the name of the song that plays after ""WORST HEROES EVER""?"
CmRih_VtVAs,El Diablo dies in Suicide Squad after sacrificing himself to kill Enchantress' brother. Enchantress gets her heart crushed by Rick Flagg.
CmRih_VtVAs,"gotta love the joker and harley relationship they're like Sid and Nancy! 
its mutually abusive she's kicked his ass as much as he has hers!  only difference is joker enjoys it when she kicks his ass! lucky she wasn't in dark knight if harley was there when joker called Rachel doors beautiful better believe she would bunny boil the bitch! glenn close ain't got nothing on harley!  but i do love all the feminist that call joker abusive and turn a blind eye when she does things like cuts jokers face off and starts ""dating other people"" by putting it on men like a mask!"
CmRih_VtVAs,My New Favorite Movie!! Ima Gonna Watch Dis!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The best film I wanna watch it

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so happy it's before school starts
CmRih_VtVAs,momma mia
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does deadshot look like Tory lanez with that beard tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jut saw suicide squad. It's really good. In case you were wondering I saw it because of military reasons, and it was free"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let's admit it, we'll only watch it cause it has Queen playing in the background. If they keep on making trailers like that Blitz one, nobody will see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Just saw this movie! Pretty good! The only thing I didn't  like was the ending 8/10
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody by queen

CmRih_VtVAs,Does every female character really need to be half naked and hyper-sexualized? Their original characters weren't.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The title alone makes me want to see this. Suicide Squad. Cool. On the other hand, that's what I said about The Expendables. One of the most embarrassingly stupid movies, of all time."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rapsody just set this trailer perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad. The only movie where you'll see the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air meet the Clown Prince of Crime.

CmRih_VtVAs,This is it. This will be the movie that turns me from a marvel person to a 50/50. It's all about if I cant live without the movie for me and if I am willing to pay to watch the movie a couple more times in the theater.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 stupid fucking loser ruined it
CmRih_VtVAs,Wooooooww
CmRih_VtVAs,You guys have no idea how much I am excited to see the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer introduced me to ""queen bohemian rhapsody"".... Since then I listen to this song everyday."
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone has a hard-on for Harley... What about Will Smith? He's pretty fucking hot...
CmRih_VtVAs,"song at 1:39, please"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have mixed feelings about this joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the title of the music?
CmRih_VtVAs,so pumped up for this movieeee
CmRih_VtVAs,can someone please tell me what's name of the song from 1:45 plz
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anybody else notice these things? Like how the Universe runs in big cosmic circles, Like… Why would a rock band from the 70's make such an excellent soundtrack for trailer for a movie about Batman's Rouge Gallery Villains? Like if you took flamboyant Freddy Mercury, shaved his mustache , died his hair green , put em in a red suit and you got the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can I Haz
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey D.C. You should make a movie with Marvel?!😊
CmRih_VtVAs,"So the suicide squad is… Dead Shot, Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, ah…the Enchantress? and…  and who is the guy who controls fire? And who is the Turkish guy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hmmmmm … that is the best railer they mad of the three….
CmRih_VtVAs,Brillant - double A Plus for the Queen Sound Track! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Not my type of movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I've never wanted to see a movie more in my entire life omfg
CmRih_VtVAs,Why in the actual FUCK DOES THIS PIECE OF ART HAVE 13K DISLIKES
CmRih_VtVAs,I sure wish deathstroke was in this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,QUENN! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't wait aaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,The worst part of the trailer ls at 2:31 because that's where lt ends
CmRih_VtVAs,"if you care about what happened in Sweden, France, Somalia, Tokyo, Germany, Turkey, Brussels......
Can we get enough of gory suicide squad?"
CmRih_VtVAs,but they said itll take place in the asylum everyone but deathstroke would be there.... but the teen Titans movie that'll be coming out in a few years will have Slade same person just a different time frame
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie could come and visit me anytime after midnight, EVEN if she was totally insane... SHE IS ABSOLUTELY HOT!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,WHO ELSE NOTICES HOW PERFECT THIS EDITING IS? LIKE WTF SO GOOD
CmRih_VtVAs,is it wierd that i am 14 and in love with Margot Robbie?
CmRih_VtVAs,That joker looks like some random guy from a gay bar
CmRih_VtVAs,la cancion del principio como se llama?
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to know what the voices are really saying
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Joker!!! the GREATEST VILLAN ever CREATED by MAN
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto from 30 seconds to mars omg and Will Smith yay can't wait to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,Me to bro me to
CmRih_VtVAs,What's he saying exactly at 00:06? Does anyone know?
CmRih_VtVAs,Heathens. twenty one pilots. thats all I have to say.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know if it's just me, but I love Batman more when he isn't a lead role and comes in to just be badass, hopefully that's what happens in this movie. Could you imagine him showing up out of nowhere to fight the suicide squad? How awesome would that be?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"the joker is hawt

or is that just me 0_0"
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so pissed they changed the rating to a 15 and now I cangt watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,I watching this movie because the QUEEN Harley Quinn is in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,here from twenty one pilots
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is shitting on Marvel/Disney Films
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think it's so awesome that this cast is filled with a who's-who of Batman villains or crossovever villains...Katana was even an ally of Bats at one time (perhaps even in this DCMU, how cool would that be?!)

I cannot wait to see how Joker and Bats tie into this story, while having it NOT be a Batman story! This is the type of shit many of us comic fans have waited our whole lives to see, movies that take chances like this.

Obviously Suicide Squad didn't do it first but they DC-WB is getting it done so....I'd be amazed if this movie sucks.


Also loving how a good portion of the plot and Amanda Waller's interactions (and Batman and Joker's) have been kept under wraps nad not spoiled."
CmRih_VtVAs,wow 6  months ago? wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my favorite trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I am not into superhero movies but for some reason I reeeally wanna watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't fucking wait to watch it it's probably gonna be the best 2016 movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so hot idek...
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this rated? Like how old do u have 2 b 2 see dis? Cuz I wanna buy I don't know if I'm old enough
CmRih_VtVAs,If Trump is elected this will all come true
CmRih_VtVAs,when  will be the movie out?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Arrow fans be like, ""You're welcome.""
Like if ya know what I mean ;D"
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker looks like someone they found on the street and just gave a roll
CmRih_VtVAs,Except from Will Smith.. this movie looks like crap..
CmRih_VtVAs,ty
CmRih_VtVAs,That Joker looks fcking hot as fck!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"[Kermit] Ehh, Scooter?

CmRih_VtVAs,This joker can never be that good as the older one.

CmRih_VtVAs,I just want to someday see Johnny Depp as the Joker...
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who thinks harely quinn looks like jinx from League of Legends?
CmRih_VtVAs,From the trailers you could say that instead of being the movie title suicide squad it could be Harley Queen movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Twenty one pilots made an album called Suicide Squad. I'm kinda confused, does the movie even relate to twenty one pilots at all or what?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"i've been waiting for this for a fucking year
and I just find out that i'm too young to watch this
and just one month i'll be 15,be able to watch it😈"
CmRih_VtVAs,This dont look like clasic Jocker
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited about this than batman v superman and I was really excited about that
CmRih_VtVAs,It's amazing what music does to the tone of a video... If this trailer had the same song as the first trailer then it would be much more serious
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Freddy Mercury
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie will own this movie. GIRL POWER!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love skrillex

CmRih_VtVAs,This is just dirty dozen with super villains
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one that thinks Will Smith makes a bad Deadshot?  based on what I've seen in previews so far its more like Will Smith in a Deadshot costume going to a halloween party rather than actual Deadshot

CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see Cara Delevingne as Enchantress. Hopefully her acting is up to par - movie should be great.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't understand! so is the bad guys killing good guys or what??

CmRih_VtVAs,is it rated r or pg 13?
CmRih_VtVAs,I am low key very attracted to Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,1:40 is literally better than any fireworks display i've seen in my country.
CmRih_VtVAs,FINALLY! The DC I always wanted to see! Not whatever boring dark violent bland rated-r movie! (Man of Steel and Batman V Superman)
CmRih_VtVAs,"i know this movie would be fab but if heath ledger is still alive, it would be a better movie :'-("
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker is lowkey very attractive, wtf"
CmRih_VtVAs,The number of times I've watched all the Trailers of this movie is unhealthy....there I said it ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Twenty One Pilots brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish it was ma or r18, when they take out the sex, coarse language and brutalviolence it makes the movie less enjoyable to watch. Deadpool was great cos they script writers had freedom to make the movie funny af but this is gonna be more appealing to younger audiences:("
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY QUINN I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,bader than dead pool?
CmRih_VtVAs,"All my friends of heathens take it slowww

CmRih_VtVAs,but what's the opening song in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,they were having fun making this

CmRih_VtVAs,"Song from 1:38

CmRih_VtVAs,"I dabed so hard, my arm broke"

CmRih_VtVAs,"Jesus, its ripped off batman, its got the joker And Harley quinn...."

CmRih_VtVAs,wake up marvel ....hahahah
CmRih_VtVAs,At first i thought that Enchantress was Poison Ivy
CmRih_VtVAs,still cant stand the look of that faggotey emo joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,BAD IDEA...........
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker just seems crappy, let's hope the move itself proves me wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,You don't even need to look at the trailer knowing it's good
CmRih_VtVAs,I've been waiting for this movie for 6 months
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh God. Harley's last words reminded me of Moriarty off of BBC Sherlock......Oh dear God. What if these people met Jim Moriarty? What if Moriarty was on the Suicide Squad? That would be both awesome and completely terrifying....
CmRih_VtVAs,The more I watch this the more I am excited for this movie!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The real question is... who's the villain?
CmRih_VtVAs,"we are bad guys, this is what we do ! Hehehe ^-^"

CmRih_VtVAs,lit trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Kayne Wests song in the background?
CmRih_VtVAs,Timmy Timmy Timmy  Turner
CmRih_VtVAs,;^)
CmRih_VtVAs,"i muted this video, and watched with Skrillex and Rick Ross's song.Just awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie shouldve been named ´Hancock and his droogies´
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the guy screaming about in the beginning? it sounds so dumb xD
CmRih_VtVAs,I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPIC MOMENT GOSH! I AM NOW AGAIN ADDICTED TO HARLEY QUINN! GAWWSH!
CmRih_VtVAs,YES a fucking bad guy movie looking like purge
CmRih_VtVAs,and where they put skrillex song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Assault on Arkham spoiled this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously hope they are going to Save the World from Rotschild, Rockerfeller, Soros, the Queen, Bankers, Corporations, Government, the Vatican, etc..."
CmRih_VtVAs,What age are you supposed to be to watch this?

CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait any longer for a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,i came here from heathens TOP
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!!! and suicide squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes! Omg I don't like the super cheesy all goodie two shoes Heros. I love that more movies are coming out about villains or people who don't classify themselves as Heros. Like Deadpool. That was fucking great. I bet this will be too.
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA DELEVINGNE IS MY WIFE SHES MINE
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker is actually amazing tho

CmRih_VtVAs,I have to go back to high school in August dammit
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn's accent should be Boston accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,I got more hyped over the track Skrillex made for this...
CmRih_VtVAs,There's just something about Bohemian Rhapsody that just pumps people up! >:D
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm quite excited for this one! Got me hyped!
CmRih_VtVAs,Unrealistic bullcrap. Green Baraes and swat would do a lot better then them.
CmRih_VtVAs,apparently Margot Robbie hated her costume
CmRih_VtVAs,caca💩
CmRih_VtVAs,the song choice is good
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody is perfect for a movie that goes balls to the wall...like this one!
CmRih_VtVAs,bets. Joker. Good or suck casting?
CmRih_VtVAs,I think bohemian rhapsody should play constantly throughout the movie lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a GOOD DC movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Viola Davis will do a wonderful job as Amanda, but I think Pam Grier's Amanda Waller is best. She fit the part so well when Smallville was still on TV. I thought she was perfect. I am so excited to see this movie. I hope it lives up to the hype!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait anymore
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie Looks Easily a 9/10
CmRih_VtVAs,Who has the Game

CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who gets chills of joy whenever they watch it?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not aloud to watch this. Oz I'm 12
CmRih_VtVAs,MOST. BEAUTIFUL. CAST. EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn. Generally I'm not that into comic book movies. There's way too many of them and considering how many almost none (except the Dark Knight) are actually great. Don't know about this but it certainly looks fucking awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Bismillah"" part has muted in the song !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,HEATHENS
CmRih_VtVAs,"One of the best trailers ever.

Hope the film delivers."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone explain to me what suicide squad is I feel left out i dont get it 😭
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm hyped. Leto looks awesome, Robbie's funny, Smith's gonna keep me from getting bored of ""They're psychos, get it?!?!"" and the rest of the ensemble are definitely gonna contribute the variety you need from a movie reliant on this type of dark humor. :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,sO READY
CmRih_VtVAs,is this another demension of Gotham city where Batman doesnt exist and joker is heavy on tatoos??
CmRih_VtVAs,LoL CaptainBoomerang with that Dr.Pepper
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait what

I can't hear Brendon at all? 

It sounds like they used the original with Freddie, and then a bit of the guitarist of Panic!, Kenneth, singing."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so ready to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,where is Batman ???
CmRih_VtVAs,0:57 that line gets me every time😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait I'm confused I heard that Brendon urie was also singing bohemian rhapsody for suicide squad

CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn makes the movie good
CmRih_VtVAs,discount joker harley quinn and what that alligator name
CmRih_VtVAs,That awkward moment when your 12 and from England so you can't see the movie eventhough you've loved the characters for years....
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the 25th time i watched this
CmRih_VtVAs,Not gonna lie most excited for harley quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever cuz the music matches it perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone please tell me whats that song played at 1:40
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is finally getting its shit together
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn it Joker, I can't wait TO SEE your toys"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else came from the heather
CmRih_VtVAs,Can I like this 500 times over
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who thinks that when captain boomerang is screaming at the beginning, it looks like Sheamus from wwe"
CmRih_VtVAs,When is this gonna come out???
CmRih_VtVAs,are we not going to talk about how pretty Cara looked in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I watch this trailer daily
CmRih_VtVAs,"jesus, the ""I'm so odd and out there"" teen angst naval gazing squad will love this... ""you're like Harley.... and Mikey is like.. bla bla"" well done, warner bros, first coup getting themselves as leaders in the fight against global media with the moronic, and ego based, anonymous, now more targeting of young adults... hopefully as many will not fall for this crap as they did thinking a time warner activist group fights time warner... fucking idiots."
CmRih_VtVAs,also the Joker's laugh (from what is in the trailer) is quite satisfying
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm personally not a fan of DC but this has a lot of hype so i might go see it
CmRih_VtVAs,DAMN I LOVE joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"what songs are used in this trailer , if someone knows pls do help me out"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:33 most satisfying thing ever
CmRih_VtVAs,I am hyped as freak for this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't pay attention to the trailer at all. I just sang bohemian rhapsody.

CmRih_VtVAs,"New news, Harley Quinn dies. When she falls from the height"
CmRih_VtVAs,yet batman!
CmRih_VtVAs,I could have done without Queen playing the whole time
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally! Am I the only one who always preferred the villains ?
CmRih_VtVAs,the fact that this trailer is amazing scares me
CmRih_VtVAs,There is no way this can be be better than 'Batman: Assault on Arkham'
CmRih_VtVAs,So who's the villain of the movie?🤔
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything seems awesome except the JOKER he looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best movie of 2016...never mind, just noticed batman was in it"

CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one that doesn't care about this movie AT ALL?....
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn😍
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the trailer that got me exited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Who was saying the words with Harley lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"if only they stuck with this dark theme like in the trailer. DC isn't suppose to be funny, people!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be insanely awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Will it be in 3D?
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the music so bad :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Hold up hold up hold up is Harley Quinn her REAL name? It's weird bc I lie her but... I don't know whether that's her real name or nah
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks boring. 
CmRih_VtVAs,joker has chage to ugly from very creepy
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't care what anyone says im excites as shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Please tell me I'm not the only one who wants to see this just because of Twenty Øne Piløts haha |-/
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:10 We are malicious individuals, this is how we conduct our business."
CmRih_VtVAs,omg they put my favorite song for my favorite movie xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley: *smashes window takes the bag*
what? were bad guys thats what we do."
CmRih_VtVAs,How is this even rated 15
CmRih_VtVAs,it's so beautiful I'm going to cry
CmRih_VtVAs,I miss the old Joker...
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith not even trying to play a convincing Deadshot.
CmRih_VtVAs,Where the fuck is king shark and killer frost?
CmRih_VtVAs,wow 53m! I want 60m min for this beautiful trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Please put it on Netflix!
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the queen soundtrack 💕💕
CmRih_VtVAs,Im a Marvel fan but I hope this movie is good. Atleast one good movie from DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,SOOOO EXITEDDD!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,This reminds me of assault on arkham
CmRih_VtVAs,"okay, or they could just show katana twice."
CmRih_VtVAs,dang ... 12k marvel fans came to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like an absolute psycho. I love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Team soldiers
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tbh it  doesen't even matter if the movie is bad, cause of the amazing soundtrack. TØP and Panic? Just take my money allready."
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope it does not disappoints like Dawn Of Justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just The Joker casually lying in a giant circle or knives, guns and baby clothes..................................umm ok. The guns and knives maybe but baby clothes?"
CmRih_VtVAs,But when the movie comes out?
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Im not sure who is my favorite Dead Shot or Captain Boomerang which do you guys like more
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still confused-- why isn't Harley with the Joker? Could someone explain that to me?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is the worst casting choice for any movie the guy is so 1 dimensional it's unbelievable plus this film looks shit too
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm excited for this movie but it's gonna get bad reviews. I know I'm gonna love it, but it's probably gonna get like a 40% on rotten tomatoes (rotten tomatoes sucks ass). If you think about it, it's kinda true, look at batman vs Superman, I thought that movie was amazing, but it got bad reviews, Man of steel, I loved it too, but it also got bad reviews, honestly this movie going to get bad reviews, it'll get a 60% AT BEST. But I know I will love it. And I do wish it was rated R so when I go see it I don't have to hear annoying ass kids yelling out "" That's Batman!!"" Or see some middle school kids acting like they are all cool and they say some stupid shit out loud when it's a sad part of its quiet, Or hearing a baby cry, Movies like this need to be rated r, atleast Deadpool was R and not many kids watched it and it was WAY more enjoyable in theaters."
CmRih_VtVAs,this has to be one of the best trailers ever. Kudos for choosing queen song too.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this movie 18+ or 12+?
CmRih_VtVAs,Another Oscar for Jared Leto?
CmRih_VtVAs,😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,IS THAT CARA????????
CmRih_VtVAs,I could already imagine Overwatch vs these guys in the most epic movie of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the songs name
CmRih_VtVAs,YASSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck me harder daddy
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks good with batman
CmRih_VtVAs,0:45 Cara?
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope cara delevigne doesn't have a big part because her acting sucks and she'll ruin the movie. I mean have you seen paper towns? She should just stick to being in Taylor swift's squad cause she can't model either.
CmRih_VtVAs,is that jared leto?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is a better trailer thsn the latest one, the last one left me unwanting to see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"While it doesn't _ruin_ the movie, I do think it is a shame that it isn't rated R. I hope that line about voices is in the movie proper."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Thank me later. ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,I just want it to be august 5th already !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,If Harley doesn't say Mista J in this movie I'm gonna lose it lmfaoo 😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's excited for the heathens song???
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is it fucking pg13?????
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope it's as good as trailers from 2015
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i finally got it . . . the reason 
 . . why some WS movies are annoying is cus he is Fresh prince of Bale .. King of Comedian. Serious face doesnot suit him."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Personally I don't like how Harley is aware of ""the voices"" in her head or says ""we're bad guys, this is what we do."" Because if she were crazy she WOULDN'T be aware that the voices in her head aren't real & she wouldn't see why the things she does are wrong. But then again; it's just a movie. 🙄"
CmRih_VtVAs,IM DEAD IM DEAJDAFJGSRJTGHRJTG
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,That moment when you cant fucking scream on the cinema hahahahah
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED TO SEE THIS
CmRih_VtVAs,YOU'RE ALL MORONS !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this movie's gonna fucking suck
CmRih_VtVAs,I KEPT HEARING IT'S THE PANIC! VERSION OF BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY AND THIS IS THE ORIGINAL WHAT
CmRih_VtVAs,remember guys we have to make an original villain black because ya know racial stuff @Deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,why did they give harley a romance novel? she could slit a guards throat with that paper!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The pursh That Harley Quinn is steeling, is that the Youtube Dimond playbutton in the form of a pursh?? Or is that just me? 

(And sorry if you can't read some of the words, I am dislective)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT TIL THIS COMES OUT I LOVE THE TRALIER AND IS IT JUST ME OR DOES JOKER KINDA LOOKS A BIT SCARIER ANF UGLY!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I orgasmed pretty hard during that I'm not gonna lie😬
CmRih_VtVAs,"finally, a diverse cast that actually includes an ASIAN PERSON!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes yes yes yes yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:17 That guy looks like Sheamus from WWE before he got the mohawk!
CmRih_VtVAs,"after the movie gets released, all the edgy teenagers are going to act like psychopaths and pretend that they lost their sanity."
CmRih_VtVAs,"If the movie is half as good as the trailer, it's going to be a masterpiece. Seriously, there should be an Oscar for trailers and this one should get it."
CmRih_VtVAs,twenty øne piløts 😭😭
CmRih_VtVAs,"Coincidentally, I was just singing We Are The Champions before watching this."
CmRih_VtVAs,Just realized Harley Quinn is my spirit animal. Everyone keeps telling others that I'm just crazy
CmRih_VtVAs,You guys know this is DC's deadpool but goes for a larger audience
CmRih_VtVAs,who is going to see Suicide Sqaud?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is too good
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,So excited for Harley and The Enchantress😩😩
CmRih_VtVAs,This might be the only DC movie I'll actually like 😂😁
CmRih_VtVAs,LITTTTT
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that bohemian rhaspody (background song) has more YouTube views than the own movie trailer makes me laugh😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Hype!
CmRih_VtVAs,"YASSS 
im gonna yel when heathens come on |-/"
CmRih_VtVAs,If you didn't know the song then you deserve to die...
CmRih_VtVAs,NEED to see this movie!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,SONG???
CmRih_VtVAs,I already wanted to see this movie really badly beforeTØP and Panic! but they made it way much better.
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,im still confused about joker his role in this movie.. is he after harley ?
CmRih_VtVAs,love this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,12k people have no soul (and this is coming from a Marvel fanboy)
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Literally drooled watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,I really like the joker in this movie I'm so EXCITED!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Came here just for the song Bohemian Rhapsody. Still, gonna watch this movie. xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know a trailer's awesome when it has ""queen""(:"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith ❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker is the best villain all time
CmRih_VtVAs,"If there would be the real Joker from dark knight rises it would be good,i mean amazing movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:40 song name please ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not gonna be disappointed when I see this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,PG-13 this is gonna suck
CmRih_VtVAs,Who came here from the song Sucker For Pain?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will smith ??!.... omg...... just noticed.... I hate this motherfucker so much!!! Why, why in the movie. why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear Sony.

Twice as many views as GB2K16 and 50x as many likes to dislikes. Don't make SJW movies ever again.

Sincerely,
Reality."
CmRih_VtVAs,"My first thought was:
'Oh look, Margot Robbie is playing jinx'"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yesss
CmRih_VtVAs,Its a good trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sure, lets make all the other male crazies attack the male guards, but lets single out the one Native character by making him punch a woman guard. (A sucker punch too no doubt.)  I'm not saying woman guards don't deal with the same shit, and they're definitely not weaker, but why does Adam Beach have to be the one to punch her?"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:28 what songs?
CmRih_VtVAs,idk why but this reminds me of the purge
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can wait to see it!
Boss"
CmRih_VtVAs,I've heard this song before. But I don't remember the name >_<
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF!! IS PROTOTYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,Seems like DC is trying to make movies more like marvel movies. I really hope they don't do this. Hopefully the movie will be more like the dark knights. I just don't want it to be a flop like batman vs superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 me just about every fucking minute of the day
CmRih_VtVAs,And for Killer croc
CmRih_VtVAs,I am Bit also for deadshot he was a cool Batman villan now we just need deathstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk. this movie just doesn't look that good. At least for me it doesn't. It basically looks like 'Lets get a small backstory for these random bad people and make them kill something' so idk. This movie is probably gonna be like every other movie thats been over hyped. if anyone knows what actually makes these movies worth it please let me know.
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie makes no sense because if you watch batman you would know that THE JOKER DIES AND THE JOKER IS IN THIS SO IT MAKES NO SENSE
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks so good if Adam sandler was in it , it would still be good !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith passed on id 2 for this? at least margot robie is hot
CmRih_VtVAs,JARED LETO MY LITTLE CINNAMON BUN😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"i would laugh like hell if this makes more money than bvs(and sure it will be better than bvs)

MAN! U GOT JOKER, HARLEY QUINN,DEADSHOT ..etc what more u want"
CmRih_VtVAs,Im gonna see it cuz itz amazin
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like the best movie of this year 🌵
CmRih_VtVAs,They've got my attention...
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is so hot tbh 
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Jared Leto dies or at least goes crazy after this movie, no one will ever want to play the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,bruh I get a boner watching Harley Quinn bend over
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is so fucking hot I would smash anyone else
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just me that's excited for Cara? Ok, it's just me"
CmRih_VtVAs,kinda wish Harley had a higher pinch voice. is it just me?😞
CmRih_VtVAs,2016The year heroes can't get along but the bad guys can
CmRih_VtVAs,1:42 why is that guy looking like Panda Panda Panda Panda Panda?
CmRih_VtVAs,I can see Marilyn Manson making a killer Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,the trailer makes this movie look like there's way too much action in it which makes me think there may not be enough time for character build up
CmRih_VtVAs,"Epic selection of the Song......every word of it fits perfectly, and after 1:37 no words.....Just Salute !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,yo this might just be the first dc movie that is actually good.
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the greatest trailers EVER made!
CmRih_VtVAs,IVE NEVER BEEN THIS HYPED ABOUT A MOVIE BEFORE
CmRih_VtVAs,I really don't understand what the hype is about this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,12K DISLIKES...that's outrageous
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here 4 Eminem
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that my boy Will Smith?
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything is better when played alongside queen
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this movie and I'm not even sure when it will be released in my country!!! :'(
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ace chemicals at 1:58
CmRih_VtVAs,kick will smith out and it will be a good movie
CmRih_VtVAs,my favorite trailer so far
CmRih_VtVAs,"I predict another bloated, incoherent and dour mess of a movie, despite the reshoots and the sassy trailers. After two zack snyder bombs and the complete clusterfuck that was arkham city on PC, it baffles me why anyone still have faith in warner brothers and their pathetic, desperate attempts to create their own DC cinematic universe.

And jared leto's joker looks pathetic."
CmRih_VtVAs,have batman lol
CmRih_VtVAs,i love u Harley quin
CmRih_VtVAs,why do like this movie so much
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbies character is so unoriginal but other than that this looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,I really would love to see deathstroke appear....
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer eveeeer!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck will smith
CmRih_VtVAs,is joker talking to batman at 1:21
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone know definitely which character Scott Eastwood plays?
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is like that kid in school who randomly starts trying and starts pissing off the smart kid (marvel) with his superior grades XD
CmRih_VtVAs,the video game brought me here !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What in the actual fuck!! Can someone explain me why are some Die Antwood's draws here???? I'm having a fucking orgasm for this!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,tis going to be my berthey end my tio is going to take me end i em sow happy♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡
CmRih_VtVAs,YES FUCK YES FUCK ME YES FUCK FUCK
CmRih_VtVAs,"Out of all the people breathing air, you couldn't have done better than Will Smith? That guy sucks at everything"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who has played Suicide Squad Special Ops. Its very fun. You get to play as Deadshot, Harley and The Fire Dude_Forgot his name. Its for Android and Apple."
CmRih_VtVAs,""" Oh , I'm Not Gonna Kill Ya , I'm Just Gonna Hurt Ya , Really , Really , Bad ! "" I Need See This Movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does Batman come out in this movie as well?
CmRih_VtVAs,Lot's of senseless violence!  But I am going to watch this movie on IMAX and enjoy it :)
CmRih_VtVAs,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guardianknightcomics/gears-and-bones-vol-1-trade
CmRih_VtVAs,First time watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,this film is going to suck so  hard :) wait and see

CmRih_VtVAs,no red band trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,Heya buddy.. Rofl own It's   fantastic !xideo control
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lmao 66,666 comments (sorry I made it 66,667)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman in it sort of takes a lot of the premise of the story. Why the heck is he needed in this flick? He just gets in the way of Suicide Squad. I don't understand why the producers / writers / directors put him is beyond me. He's just a distraction.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I plan on seeing this, but is anyone having trouble being convinced of this version of Harley Quinn? Like this is a difference character just mooching off the name."
CmRih_VtVAs,https://youtu.be/CmRih_VtVAs?t=127
CmRih_VtVAs,Samuel jackson
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's most excited for Harley Quinn and the soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the thing at 1:45 riping the subway train
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just what the world needs, ANOTHER comic book movie..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is amazing no matter how many times I watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,Lets hope they don't immediately kill off captain boomerang like they did in Arrow.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see very little potential acting wise, apart from Will Smith, Jared Leto and Viola Davis."
CmRih_VtVAs,My dicks going to hurt after that movie XD

CmRih_VtVAs,this is gonna be great

CmRih_VtVAs,Damn Harley @ 2:08
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the point of The joker without Batman? Sucks.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So basically, this movie will have nothing to do with the contents of the comic book?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Glad its only pg13
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm literally just watching this for Harley and the Enchantress the fact that there scenes of the joker is also a plus
CmRih_VtVAs,tbh I'm just watching this for Twenty One Pilots
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie is harley quinn isn't it. she is very sexy I must say✍✍✍

CmRih_VtVAs,The Hot Topic CEO Must Be Busting A Nut To This Lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,The moment I heard bohemian rhapsody I knew I had to watch this movie :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Does Jamey Marie Presley play Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the background music? I forgot the song.
CmRih_VtVAs,rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hate the fact that will smith is in this movie but I'm still gonna watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst. Comic Book Guy Reference. Ever.

You're welcome."
CmRih_VtVAs,since when did the joker had silver teeth and jacket and why doesnt he have a long lipstick on his face and purple jacket and flower ehat happened to the old look
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why do I have the feeling that will smith will be the final nail that stops Any future dc movies for a while. And now they are talking about a love triangle between Harley, death shoot and the joker :/ so I guees it's gonna be a sequel to fokus or some thing? I Hope it's gonna be good but I Really dont think so."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is joker even part of the squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Crazy women is  best.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer was so good! Now it feels like they're ramming down our throats that they're ""bad guys."" 
Deadshot: We the bad guys
Harley: We're bad guys it's what we do!
Amanda: I want to assemble a task force of some very bad people
Guy in restaurant: They're bad guys"
CmRih_VtVAs,its all most out 😁
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nobody cares about the twenty one pilots song. ""I'm only here because of twenty one pilots."" Please go on some other page to parade on how much of a fan girl you are. This is the suicide squad trailer not the heathens video so go away."
CmRih_VtVAs,so excited! this looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,whoever paused at 2:07 .... HIGHFIVE xD
CmRih_VtVAs,the Joker looks kind of stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,how old should you be to watch this?
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG can't stop watching this trailer. Can't wait for the movie!! Who's watching this for Heathens, Harley Quinn, And The Joker? *evil laughs*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, this movie will be #1 if it were only rated R and not some PG-13 rating for pussies"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone know the age rating ?
CmRih_VtVAs,where the hell did the killer croc and the witch appear? I never saw those 2 in the comics...
CmRih_VtVAs,smh at all the dumb teens wanting to watch this badass movie just because of some shitty song by a fuckboi band
CmRih_VtVAs,only watching this movie due to twenty one pilots writing heathens for it :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Are they god?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm watching this movie cause it looks awesome (also cause Harley Quinn is hot)
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad 🎥 trailer with electronic music on my channel
CmRih_VtVAs,My cousin worked on this movie which I find really cool!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Betweem all the hype of Joker,Harley and all, most people forget that fucking KILLER CROC is in this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"Omg, Less than One mouth. Just two weeks, I can't wait!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,When Will Smith is in the film you know it will be good
CmRih_VtVAs,This is like my 50th time watching this trailer. This is going to be the best movie ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is DC's respond to Deadpool.
CmRih_VtVAs,realease date plz???

CmRih_VtVAs,sexy toys joker
CmRih_VtVAs,i miss heath ledger :(
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that cara
CmRih_VtVAs,I wouldn't be surprised if Heath came back from the dead for the sole purpose to take the role as joker back for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone's here for Jared Leto?
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this song
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm going to see this with my roommate when it comes out. I love twenty one pilots and I love jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 😍😍😍😍😘😘😘
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, idea Does anyone   understand  larger than thi| case ."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm only watching this because of heathens and im lesbian af for Harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker will probably be pretty good. Jared Leto is a damn good method actor. Margo Robbie seems to have pulled off Harley Quinn too. She's a great actress. Will Smith is amazing in Hancock so he'll probably be good as Deadshot too. Those three are the main characters, so I don't think we have anything to worry about. It's interesting to me that not all of these characters are villains."
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song
CmRih_VtVAs,1:20 i remmber him sayin I cant to show you my NEW toys not I cant wait to show you my toys
CmRih_VtVAs,Tiene muy buena pinta
CmRih_VtVAs,cara delevingne is pretty shit at acting no offence to her but it's true
CmRih_VtVAs,Yay!!!!!!!!! Harley Quinn!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even like DC but this time I'm making an exception for Harley Quinn. She's amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the music?
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't know angry grampa was in the movie 0:05
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am a straight girl who does not know very much about DC comics except it has Batman, Superman and Joker. BUT DANG HARLEY QUINN HERE IS SLAYING MY EXISTENCE. I swear, if I am not gonna get into comics after that, then i dont even know what is life animore."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks really bad
CmRih_VtVAs,1:38 part lol I'm just watching because Harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Happy birthday to me/Happy birthday to me/This comes out on my birthday/Happy birthday to me...And please don't be like the latest Fantastic Four movie. I hope you don't do that to me!
CmRih_VtVAs,Adam Beach ayyyy ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Hardcore Henry 2 is already out?
CmRih_VtVAs,YAAAAASSSSS I WANNA SEE IT SO BAD
CmRih_VtVAs,BOUGHT FUCKING TICKETS FUCK YESSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,copied from arrow .. oh again feelsbad for deathshot .. he wasn't really bad ..
CmRih_VtVAs,"For those of you who don't know one of the most iconic songs ever that's playing in the background, it's Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. RIP Freddy Mercury"
CmRih_VtVAs,sorry its the voices haha that's not what they really said
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm going to watch this shit because of Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,lol hope their marvel/kick ass approach for this pays off. I doubt it.
CmRih_VtVAs,The soundtrack for this movie is so awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my god I want to see this movie so bad. but I'm 13. And my parents are super strict...
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything looks cool but new joker will be a huge disappointment due to over acting and show off. Late Heath ledger has set the bars really high
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk why but I just came for Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,oh nice Jinx is playing Harley quinn should be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,BRING BACK SCARECROW ! JONATHAN CRANE NEEDS TO CONTINUE EXISTING! ;-;
CmRih_VtVAs,i am so ready for harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Plz don't fuck up like Superman Vs Batman did...... plz plz plz......... This movie is the only hope for DC to shine I swear.........
CmRih_VtVAs,yasss queen 😍😍❤❤❤
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,batman in vacation
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCKING GOODMY 12 YEAR OLD BRO WANTS TO WATCH IT!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks Melanie Martinez should've been in Harley's place but Harley still got this tho😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, no comments once so ever on the Queen song (Bohemian Rhapsody) playing in the background?"
CmRih_VtVAs,omg i cant wait till this movie come out i have the shirts and posters

CmRih_VtVAs,why does this feel like dead pool all over again?
CmRih_VtVAs,lmao you didnt tell me that Cara Delivenge is here
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one who thinks that Harley is ugly and why doesn't she have the cute accent...?
CmRih_VtVAs,01:52 i hope that is prototype
CmRih_VtVAs,Spoiler Alert Deadshot dies according to the comics
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hope Harley talks a little higher in the movie, like it was in the classic cartoon :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Mama Mia mama Mia
CmRih_VtVAs,This better come out in America first this time
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, I think this will be one giant mess of a movie. They are introducing a lot of characters, most of which we never heard and/or don't give a shit about. I fear it will be like ""Avengers smth smth Ultron"" with creators more focused on giving every character their five minutes than telling a story..."
CmRih_VtVAs,It's messed up because joker and Harley they are together then they are not.. And it keeps going.. But ❤️Harley And Joker ❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen is the best
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Im totally dying to see this movie and not because of some song but because it looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"At 2:10 she so should have said, ""Window shopping."" The missed opportunity drives me crazy every time."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 oH YUM
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so exited!😱😍
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 minutes... I would destroy that booty 24/7

CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be bad ass movie ever I going to love this so much 😆😆 and Harley Quinn is my favorite love her she is bad ass can't wait for this movie 😆😆😆😩😩
CmRih_VtVAs,"They did joker justice 
New look is amazing !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does will smith ever not save the world?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, but when is DC going to make a Justice League movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC >> Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Eobard Thawne > Suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to make more than $42 dollars.  You watch and see.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone's here for Harley, I'm more of a Joker kind of person"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm pumped for this
CmRih_VtVAs,I love harleyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

CmRih_VtVAs,im watching it
CmRih_VtVAs,is it me or can the solo from Knights of Cydonia can go with this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,WOOOW
CmRih_VtVAs,Y SO MANY DISLIKES?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I came here for Heathens, but this must be a damn good movie I really want to watch it now!"
CmRih_VtVAs,They didn't play the PatD version of BoRhap?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can you feel it? This is about the insanity of our culture, the madhouse the corporate-state has committed us all to. It is shows how society is reaching a breaking point, and that soon all hell will break loose. Hold on tight, amigos, it's gonna be a wild ride."
CmRih_VtVAs,Im sweating from watching the trailer. I HAVE to see it.
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like a terrible take on guardians of the galaxy. boo.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my favorite trailer. And Katana is my favorite member of the Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,my eyes were all on Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,super hero movies are making huge moves in the past couple years.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this Will Smith movie or he's just in it.? Didn't do sequel to Independence Day good decision suicide squad bad  decision
CmRih_VtVAs,THE HYPE IS REAL
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one that gets an adredilen high from watching this?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley 💖💖💗
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope I HOPE it will be just like Batman: Assault on Arkham. That movie was so amazing. 
I don't think it will be like it, but l hope it will be..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so pumped for this
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,how old do you need to be to watch this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant wait for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,i hope this movie is better than that superman vs batman BULLSHIT.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i reeeeally find harley quin attractive,
just a point."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52
CmRih_VtVAs,"Look, whether or not y'all have hype for this movie, can we take a minute to appreciate how brilliantly this trailer was edited? I mean, machine gun fire synced to the beat of Bohemian Rhapsody. Oof."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dont forget to Warn-a-brother!

Remind me when did they ever get things right in making a comicbook movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,is the stuff that the joker was lifting Quinn out of the stuff he got pushed into
CmRih_VtVAs,Willem Dafoe needs to be the next joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love that Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"At first I was just gonna watch this for Heathens, but NOW"
CmRih_VtVAs,MY BIRTHDAY IS ONe DAY AFTER THE RELEASE
CmRih_VtVAs,Wayne's world :v
CmRih_VtVAs,name suicide squad 2 team members (wish list)
CmRih_VtVAs,If Margot Kidder's the principal reason to see this movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's watching because of Cara Delevingne?
CmRih_VtVAs,i just love the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect gunfire synchronization at 1:23
CmRih_VtVAs,"I edited this trailer to look like a horror movie, I would really appreciate it if you checked it out!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just gotta say, having Bohemian Rhapsody as the background music for this trailer was a great choice."
CmRih_VtVAs,ESTE FILME SERÁ MUITO FODA!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Slipknot dies first, El Diablo sacrifice himself, Waller is kidnapped by Enchantress, a red blur puts Boomerang in jail"
CmRih_VtVAs,for the league fans is it just me or jai courtne's voice sounds almost the same as yasuo's voice 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,This might actually be one of the best trailers I've ever seen. Such a shame the movie is usually never anything like the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the  music
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the guy at 1.16 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever comments suicide squad sucks your a dummy the only thing I don't like about movie joker looks like such a trouble maker but he also looks stupid like really they put tattoos on joker and his hair it's too green and he has silver teeth crazy joker looking weird and he has a freakin joker mobile it looks sick that's the bad thing about it!🕷
CmRih_VtVAs,I just notice almost all these people from batman incept that witch and katana well actually I think katana is from batman too😵
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited for this movie..
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is a cutie
CmRih_VtVAs,el boton de reproduccion esta siendo violado
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN HOLY FUCKSNEEKSW
CmRih_VtVAs,has anyone notice.how is harley q taller than croc.Like really wtf croc is probably the  biggest villian in DC.they trying to make it more realistic making him normal size man.He's a comic book character that looks like a fucking crocodile.Jesus just like bane in dark night.they should tower over everyone.how on earth did they fuck that up shit was it even mentioned when they were shooting the film.Dam they ruined what could of been the coolest villain in DC.they couldn't do some shit to make him bigger. Christ  look at lotr hobbits they couldn't do same shut but bigger.and no one is even talking about this.and also wtf is up with there wardrobes.they in some hip hop punk rock star crossover.idk I bet this movie will blow and since when has the joker wear stupid cliche tats there so generic joker don't follow trends.
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker gives me boners. I don't even have willy though. It's all vagina. Harley Quinn too (obviously)
CmRih_VtVAs,the timing with the music and the trailer is so fucking satisfying
CmRih_VtVAs,bullshiiittttt  what  if supermann  wanna take white house..this fuckers dont even get a 1%  chance!!  and stopp making murdere. killers the god hero..asss

CmRih_VtVAs,Great song choice 👏👍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Remind me, who exactly is the skull-tattooed dude?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't care what anyone says: the Penguin is my favorite Batman villain! Why isn't he in ""Suicide Squad?!"" Just because he can't...run...or...really do anything...he's still awesome! If my psyche was a person, it would look like Danny DeVito as the Penguin. The Penguin is gangsta!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Gonna be an awesome movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks bloody amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh yeah, the joker died at the end and Harley Quinn is all over Deadshots nuts"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think I'll save my money, I've already seen it. Not that good, just watch batman assault on Arkham, it's literally the exact same thing but in cartoon form"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best

CmRih_VtVAs,51 million views
CmRih_VtVAs,Personally I think that Will Smith never brings anything to the character he plays. Of course he's a fantastic actor I just don't see anything in the characters he play. Maybe it's just the dull character idk.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 Djmariio?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasnt gonna see it until I found out Cara Delevigne will be playing the enchantress

CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevingne 😻👑
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can´t wait! I´m so glad that less than month and we will finally see it. OK, I admit wanna see it mostly because of Jared, but I think this is gonna be one of the best movies to me so far."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really hope this movie competes with the hits of Marvel. The idea and designs of the characters feel original. Nice to see a movie from the villains perspective. Marvel is great, but I'm sick of it now."
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is that
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh my God, the way the song matches with the clips... So perfect"
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN HELP PLEASE :((((((((((((

CmRih_VtVAs,I like Arrow's version of dead shot
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm surprised no one is complaining about 1:59?? i mean they completely changed her origin story
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie looks so fucking hot as Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,Who actually here wants to watch the movie instead of some dumb excuse?

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not just excited to watch it for one thing. I'm excited to see how all of it turns out
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm only watching this because will Smith is the only good actor in this entire movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is in the wrong genre. I hope he doesn't ruin it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant stand comic based movies except for Batman. Funny i cant wait to watch Suicide Squad. Guess it's because i always wanted the villains to win XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow the like to dislike ratio is amazing compared to ghostbusters

CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to see this with my squad
CmRih_VtVAs,i will not let this wack movie mess up my favorite song.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nothing like Will Smith playing Will Smith in a Will Smith movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"No matter what problems you are dealing with, we want to help you find a reason to keep living. By calling 1-800-273-TALK(8255) you’ll be connected to a skilled, trained counselor at a crisis center in your area, anytime 24/7."
CmRih_VtVAs,Gonna watch this movie just because of Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"One thing I'll say about DC is that they're jumping into the more fantastic elements of their universe a lot sooner than Marvel and that's a good thing. I feel like Marvel grazed it a bit in Thor but never took it full throttle, and they're just starting to embrace it with Ant-Man, GotG, and now Dr. Strange. Really hoping this movie kicks ass. Couldn't ask for a better time to be a comic book fan."
CmRih_VtVAs,this is maybe the best trailer ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this movie :D
CmRih_VtVAs,|-/

CmRih_VtVAs,"Welp, people, I'm gearing up to see Suicide Squad. Anyone else?"
CmRih_VtVAs,what excuse will you DCucks come up with when this bombs?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 ruined the moment
CmRih_VtVAs,while everyone making sexual comment about Harley or only interested in this movie bcuz of her Im just here for the sexiest crazy joker! that is my number 1 reason for this movie. nr 2 is harley quinn and nr 3 is joker and harley together!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm watching DAT on Aug 5th my baday

CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks terrible. Are people aware this was a comic? NO.

CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't care what anyone says, I fucking love the new Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fuck...12 year olds must be pumped for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think that Heath Ledger's Joker is better, I think he would have been casted in this movie if he hadn't died in 2008"
CmRih_VtVAs,Stupid storyline if you ask me but it will be cool to see Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if the Deathstrok will appear in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,I think cara delevingne and Joel kinnamon make out .. Watch 3 trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is the fresh meat at Belle Reve.
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool could kill all alone
CmRih_VtVAs,I watch this trailer at least twice a day because I cannot fricking wait
CmRih_VtVAs,is jinx based off of the crazy girl in this movie or is it the other way around?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Are people seriously just watching this movie because of Tøp and P!atd?

Do you not see this amazing trailer? Do you not see how amazingly this fantastic song lines up with the movie? DO YOU NOT SEE THAT HARLEY AND JOKER ACTION?!?!

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm very confused as to why any band other than Queen is being mentioned in the comments.

CmRih_VtVAs,but the did a very good job on harley. maybe the new joker will grow on me I don't know
CmRih_VtVAs,the joker is supposed to look evil not retarded honestly he looks nothing like eny of the past jokers. I don't know maybe it's just me but I think he should look more like him.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Guess what guys!!I came here to watch the trailer!!Not bc of one song!!Yay😄

."
CmRih_VtVAs,i knew it was gonna have these these many views!
CmRih_VtVAs,"one of the best trailers i've seen, and i can't wait for the movie to come out ❤"
CmRih_VtVAs,I am not even big on these kinds of movies but this seems interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,Harleys Voice should of been more higher. since its how she always was. but still hot
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear  to fucking god when I'm in the movies watching this I will scream Margot Robbie is hawt
CmRih_VtVAs,"All my friends are Heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know.
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Christopher Nolan should've directed this ,,I think David Ayer going to do a good job on this ,, this movie dosent look to dark dc movies always stand out because it's a dark drama action movie... Hmmmnn"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just in case nobody looked at the fucking soundtrack there is 1 panic at the Disco COVER and 1 twenty one pilots song and for all the pre teen faggots who are saying they're only watching it for the soundtrack, the rest of the album is mostly rap you fucking cunts Eminem is on the album but you don't hear anyone saying ""I'm only watching this for Eminem"" so no one cares about only 2 songs on the album that are edgy hot topic playlists because the rest of the album is gonna be an amazing rap album so shut the fuck up"
CmRih_VtVAs,i still don't get why this is called suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,the song in the trailer is so good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kinda wish they chose a different actress for Harley. The look is great, but the accent kinda throws me off. Harley's always had that sorta pseudo cutesy tone, which makes her even more snarky. Although the actress does look like how I always imagined Harley. Also, can we have a suicide squad 2 with cat woman in it?"
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the movie rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the movie rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,No hate to this movie but King Shark doesn't look good at all and joker looks too young...
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait so what exactly is this movie about?
CmRih_VtVAs,o man this movie is going to be bad ass marking my days in a calendar till then
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it possible to not be hyped about this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,looks boring
CmRih_VtVAs,Im watching this because 1. The joker (jared leto) because he is so hot as the joker and not to mention my favorite villain of all time 2. Harely Quinn because come on shes harely Quinn. and lets just take a minute of silence because Margot Robbie is playing her 3. Deadshot because will smith 4. Captain Boomer rang cause he is hilarious in this movie 5. Heathens and You don't own me. those are 5 valid reasons to watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot and Jared are frickin incredible.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i want to see This movie so baaaad, it's so fucking cool"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith as Deadshot is cringeworthy
CmRih_VtVAs,Ben Affleck not again....
CmRih_VtVAs,Dead pool already took the title of worst super hero ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"lets be real here... 
the editing is done by a fucking god"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Heathans though.
|-/"
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song?

CmRih_VtVAs,Hit the Dab
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Joker looks like a Marilyn Manson ripoff, and they could of picked someone better for Harley."
CmRih_VtVAs,No one watching this just because it looks like an awesome movie? Or for the comics? Because everyone is apparently here for tøp or harley etc.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the Crazy girl Harley??
CmRih_VtVAs,calling all edgy teens

CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the purse look like a diamond play button
CmRih_VtVAs,"everyone is here talking about the soundtrack while I'm going ""please don't suck like BVS please please have an actual plot and not overly use will smith"

CmRih_VtVAs,Heath Ledger is still better as Joker. ;(
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it weird that I find Quinn extremely attractive ?  😨😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Either the trailer is awful or this looks absolutely shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,i just watched the trailer in the big screen!!!!! one of the best experiences i ever had!!! :D just amazing!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who wants to be a hero? So fucking boring.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm gonna be Harley for Halloween
CmRih_VtVAs,"People who listen to twenty one pilots
1. Suicidal 2. Emo 3. Feminist (same thing)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think this actually looks pretty good, I just cringe at that last line every time I hear it though. ""We're bad guys, it's what we do"". That sounds like something my eight year old niece would say to justify doing something. Like, there wasn't anything more witty the writers could come up with?"
CmRih_VtVAs,nahh.... she's just crazy xD
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck all the people who are seeing this because of tøp. This looks like a badass movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's heathens
CmRih_VtVAs,dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks ridiculous.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Here for the craziness couple ever .. Joker x Harley Quinn 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't to show you my toys!!! 😀👏🔪🃏🔫💰
CmRih_VtVAs,Super long buildup i expect a letdown.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody is so amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks like a good movie and I'm interested to see it, but seems like the joker ""leto"" is the bad guy and Harley Quinn ""robbie"" is apart of the group to save the world. now they're supposed to be lovers, how are they ""enemies"" in this movie thanks for the help"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad and Bohemian Rhapsody EPIC
CmRih_VtVAs,|-/ <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is back!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I am going to watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys
CmRih_VtVAs,terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,12k people will be murdered by deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,MAMA KIll SHOT A MAN
CmRih_VtVAs,P!ATD anyone ... This reminds me of .... Never mind
CmRih_VtVAs,in theaters on my bday yaas
CmRih_VtVAs,"well if its not a sad trailer then its not normal to cry, but it could just cause ur happy its coming out people cry when there happy sometimes"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just have a quick question for everyone, is it normal to cry during these trailers? I'm asking for a friend of course."
CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't Harley Quinn remind you of Jinx from League of Legends? (or is it the other way round)
CmRih_VtVAs,wheres tyler and josh? oh they were still singing as they fight
CmRih_VtVAs,What 12.000 idiots disliked this???
CmRih_VtVAs,song at 1:47?

CmRih_VtVAs,"Besides that heathens shit, anybody here because they actually want to see the movie?? Because same"
CmRih_VtVAs,umm pyrocynical everyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,I have never been more excited IN MY LIFE
CmRih_VtVAs,I love u r make up Harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think it's stupid to watch a movie just because of one song. I watch a movie because I'm excited for the movie itself, not one soundtrack. Twenty One Pilots makes good music, no doubt. But I don't understand why you are willing to watch Suicide Squad just because of Heathens? I mean, you can simply buy the Album and listen to it 24/7. Can someome be so kind and explain this to me?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait so the Queen himself Brendon Urie is covering Bohemian Rhapsody and Heathens is there cool. I was planning to see it anyways but that's just a really cool Bonus!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it just me, coz I just really cant wait for this movie !!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,How many people are going to hang them self during the showing
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait until this movie comes out
CmRih_VtVAs,what movies should I watch to learn about the villains in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Why pg 13?
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking fan girls plauging the cinema. fuck off and shove your popstars poster up your ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol, wtf"
CmRih_VtVAs,there heathens!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone is only here for the soundtrack....I'm here to see a badass movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I did not come here cuz of the song...I'm not going to see it just cuz of the songs...I'm not going to freak tf out just cuz of the songs
CmRih_VtVAs,Sad that this looks way better than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,heathens?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait... who was singing that Bohemian Rhapsody? It wasn't Brendon. Was it? Or was that the original?
CmRih_VtVAs,at the last part she has a point
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm in it for Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,when is suicide squad 2 coming

CmRih_VtVAs,Missclicked. Heard bohemian rhapsody. Stayed
CmRih_VtVAs,I stg if I see one more person watch this JUST for tøp I'm going to riot.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Shoots people, Eats people, burns people, possessed by a witch, and she's just crazy.                                                                                 Sounds like the Republican party. LOL"
CmRih_VtVAs,That girl is jinx.
CmRih_VtVAs,"k so yeah twenty one pilots is great but its getting very annoying with the ""im just here because of heathens"" what if someone said they are going to a tøp concert just to listen to stressed out live? I'm pretty sure you'll get all defensive about that. Go enjoy the movie whatever but don't swarm the comments with the same thing over and over again. If you want to talk about heathens go to the heathens music video , just came out recently."
CmRih_VtVAs,wtf is this ive never heard of this movie till now
CmRih_VtVAs,The amount of times I've seen this trailer...

CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song in the beginning?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oml! The synchronization of the weapons going off, with the bohemian rhapsody,  was epic!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this erases the bitter taste from Batman v. Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone know Adam Beach
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want a standalone movie for ""Katana"""
CmRih_VtVAs,um where is the traditional harley voice..

CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name plz!
CmRih_VtVAs,I came for the Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst.trailer.ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Best use of a music in a trailer i've ever seen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,wasn't this film supposed to originally be rated R?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Life Cycle of Films in the Internet age:

Audience: July 2- ""I Can't wait for this movie to come out. it's gonna be badass!!!


Film opens: YouTube Critics- ""It sucks!!!""



Audience- ""It does??? Uuuh...Okay. Suicide Squad sucks!!! I hate it when they make the trailer badass, and the whole movie sucks."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Just what the world needs. More violent movies based on comic books. Pass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyones here for heathens or either P!ATD. I'm here for both, and the movie itself. It's kind of weird just to go to a movie for a song or two. Not to mention, aren't the full songs."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm very sad to say this but Harley Quinn looks like a skank/slut
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm very very disappointed with Harley's new costume! Harley never wore ""booty shorts""! She wore a black and red jumpsuit! So if the actor had such a problem with her costume then she should have said something! Again Harley never dressed like a skank so... And yes the actor of Harley was uncomfortable/hated her costume!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Heathens!
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you're seriously only going to watch this movie just because there's a couple songs in it that you like, you're an idiot. Waste of money to see a movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,If this movie flops(hope it doesn't)Fox just needs to hand the DC universe over to Marvel because the last several movies they've done have been shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so freaking ready for this!! can't wait😱😱😱
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason I'm watching this movie is because they put Queen in the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside-down, and I'd like to take a minute, so just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became infamous in Gotham Bel-Air."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys! It's what we do!"" haha I want to murder whoever decided it was a good idea to put that in the script"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I hear voices too.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hyped, but I think film was on universe DC heroes. Hope so"
CmRih_VtVAs,Craaaaap
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who tf is Heathens? What's with this top shit and all this rave of the Bohemian Rhapsody and all crap? I came here to see if there were good reviews on the movie, not butthurt fans complaining about the soundtrack."
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Oliver?
CmRih_VtVAs,She does NOT sound like Harley Quinn.... where is the accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,wheres watchman 2?
CmRih_VtVAs,NO IT NEEDS THE P!ATD COVERRRR
CmRih_VtVAs,This suicide squad is so popular I just had to see the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What the fuck is up with all this ø shit?
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok i must say i am a huge marvel fan and ive never really been into DC as much, but this looks fantastic. Very excited!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay... Who disliked the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thanks for stealing Will Smith assholes.

-Independence Day Fans"
CmRih_VtVAs,team marvel

CmRih_VtVAs,is this a real film? is this just pandering?
CmRih_VtVAs,Are these people seposed to be good?
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer itself is a masterpiece.
CmRih_VtVAs,Uh am I the only one who's excited for the movie itself and not heathens? I mean I love the song but I'm v excited about the movie in general too
CmRih_VtVAs,what's this song called
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks like fun, except will smith and the blond actress."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley doesn't have her accent!

CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is the best!!! And they made it match so well with Bohemian Rhapsody! I am not a big fan of the song but I loved it here! And then I found out that it's being performed by Panic! At The Disco and I got even more excited!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Choose Panic! At The Disco for the future movies!!!! Brendon is the best!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Why are Queen songs so fitting with action movie trailers?
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMFG all these comments are about the music, talk about something else!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the guy in 0:54?
CmRih_VtVAs,this song goes perfect with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no idea what was going on in that entire trailer all I know is that Will Smith is in there.
CmRih_VtVAs,Prepare the memes...
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot is hooot

CmRih_VtVAs,THE SONG IS  BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY YESSSSSSSS!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Their Bad Guys""
""The worst of the worst"" 


Oh the lies the lies."
CmRih_VtVAs,Love dis movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn reminds me of Jinx from League of Legends
CmRih_VtVAs,Daaaaaaaaaamn 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok..ok Ik this Is a stupid question but...what about batman? Sups?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't  wait for this song... And to hear Heathens and Sucker For Pain
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen makes everything better
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks really good. The only flaw is that Harley and Joker look and act nothing like the original characters from the comics and movies. Harley is supposed to be this childish lost puppy with a hammer not a bat, and they make her a psychotic slut. Joker is supposed to be a stuck up sugar daddy and they make him a gangster-like guy. Overall, great movie, just doesn't portray the characters very well. Oh and let's be honest. Most of us are only seeing it because Heathens and Bohemian Rhapsody. XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,I need riddler I feel that he has so much potential idk why
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen Anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,person who plays harly quinn looks like jaime pressly
CmRih_VtVAs,August!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^-^ right around the corner
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh sweet Jeez, please please don't suck. After the cram fest that was BvS, DC can't take another bad hit. Hell, I would settle if the movie was just O K, I'm not even hoping for a mindblow anymore."
CmRih_VtVAs,That was so cool
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant stop lissing to the song called heathens in this and the movie omg I cant wait!!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,Im just a sucker for pain
CmRih_VtVAs,"chick that plays harley quinn can not capture her personality and her annoying whinny voice, which was what was cool about her. also fucking killer crock. i just cant deal with his small size compare to the comics, its as lame as when they introduce real juggernaut. these characters suppose to be freaks of natures. their main draw is their size."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like this movie is either going to be really good, or they are going to fuck it up. Really hoping that it is awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Twenty Øne Pilots' song Heethens is gonna be in this
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought Harley Quinn was Anne Frank
CmRih_VtVAs,"Here's a question for all the people who think this movie will do good, when was the last time WB released a PG-13 film that wasn't a complete disaster? Their most successful film last year was an R-rated action film directed by a 70 year old Australian man, while their biggest bombs were all generic PG-13 garbage. Speaking of which, it looks like we can add the latest Tarzan movie (also PG-13) to WB's growing list of bombs..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm to young to watch this but I need to watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Harleyyy look amazing

CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only top and PATD fan that wanted to see this before we found out about the soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,i like this song
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one that doesn't give a fuck about heathens... yeah cool...
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53 is that Cara Delevingne?
CmRih_VtVAs,The bass on Bohemian Rhapsody at 1:37 is very satisfying. I too am here cause of heathens XD

CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like I'm the only one who didn't come here because of Heathens
CmRih_VtVAs,"This song and trailer are good as fuck, just another reason Xbox is better than PS4, accept It nerds"
CmRih_VtVAs,low-key cringing because of all of the kids in the comments saying that they are only seeing this movie for a song. pls stop.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's sad how the majority of the comments turn from hype over the actual movie itself to hype over a song being played in the movie. I find it a bit silly and ridiculous. Really, what's the difference between listening to the whole song on your phone/ipod opposed to listening to a bit of it in the movie? If you ask me, it sounds like a waste of your money and your time just to sit through a movie over a song. Then again, a good thing that might come out of it is that people there for that purpose might end up liking the movie itself."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like it's gonna be a great movie
CmRih_VtVAs,why does this have to be on august 5th why not today!?
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant wait to show you my new toys hahaha lol
CmRih_VtVAs,50mil views? gg

CmRih_VtVAs,"Most people just want to see Harley and Joker. there's already full music vids of the small clips of Harley. Damn the movie hasn't even come out.  Chill. i bet my big toe none of them know or even care for the other characters. Unless theyre being portrayed by someone famous. (Will smith, Cara delewhatever...). 

 Heathens is lit btw. Im more excited about the song than anything"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry but this really is an insult to Joker. He's just NOT of the bad guys. 
Goin back to rippin off mob dealers? No. No!"
CmRih_VtVAs,So...where's Batman ?
CmRih_VtVAs,good trailer and cant wait to see it and cant wait to see the new joker

CmRih_VtVAs,only twenty oneeee <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, I know Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Deadshot, and Joker, but who are the others?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who gives a fuck if TOP brought you here
CmRih_VtVAs,What book is Harley reading at 0:10?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Good trailer?

CmRih_VtVAs,GAY
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 me Lolz!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,if this is going to be suicide squad how come batman is there
CmRih_VtVAs,Well it's safe to say this comment section is cancer.
CmRih_VtVAs,omggg the soundtrack for this movie is awesome😄
CmRih_VtVAs,Stfu about your gay ass heathens
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw Panic play the Bohemian Rhapsody cover live in concert and I'm excited for the studio version to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,"don't forget, we're The bad guys"
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone is going crazy about the soundtrack whilst I'm going crazy of Harley :D
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song called?
CmRih_VtVAs,mamamiya mamamiya
CmRih_VtVAs,WOMAN TRYING TO BE TOUGH@@... LOL
CmRih_VtVAs,despite what people says i believe this joker is going to be great not the best cause it's Heath but damn good either way
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the crazy girl she's so funny
CmRih_VtVAs,THE SOUNDTRACK IS THE FRACKING BEST
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just rename this trailer to twenty one pilots or some shit because it seems everybody only cares about the song in the trailer, not the movie itself"
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm in the group of people whos gonna watch the movie just because of tøp😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Twenty One Pilots and Panic at the Disco won't be in the film. Their songs are on 'Suicide Squad: The Album', not the soundtrack. The soundtrack, the music you'll hear in the movie, is made by an Oscar winning composer called Steven Price."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only people I care about in this movie are BATMANNN, Joker,  Harley Quinn, Deadshot, El Diablo, Katanna, Cap Boomerang.
anyone else in this movie looks boring so far. just so far."
CmRih_VtVAs,ZOMBIE BOY
CmRih_VtVAs,whoever is watching this in july.
CmRih_VtVAs,0.08 Turkish Coffee?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone please explain to me what this movie is about? Please?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is Heathens actually going to be in the movie or just the soundtrack for it? Or is any song on the soundtrack in the movie as well?
Sorry if it's a bit of a stupid question, I'm just a bit confused about it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ahahah the guy look's like Batman Joker if you look at him xD
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm cosplaying this Harley now half because of tøp I don't even like DC that much oml
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn can get it tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,Which song is it???
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley, Poison Ivy, and CatWoman should have a movie ♡"
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,2016; A year heroes can't get along but bad guys can
CmRih_VtVAs,What I don't get is that is this movie legit about the villains or is it a batman movie? Like wtf🤔 if it was a batman movie then why isn't he the main character of the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I miss Heath ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,first music?
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst. Heroes. Ever
CmRih_VtVAs,love how most of the comments are from the clique

CmRih_VtVAs,...bohemian rapsodi es solo para la edicion del trailer...pero quedó espectacular....quiero verla ya..!!  saludos a todos
CmRih_VtVAs,that moment when you rralise that the song playing is bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara. <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie aspires to a career in garage filmed porn.  this will help.

CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 ...
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant find one single comment that is not about Heathens and Top HAHAH

CmRih_VtVAs,"That ""creat-your-own-suicide-squad-skull"" thing is awesome, don't you think ?"

CmRih_VtVAs,|-/
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the soundtrack for this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ohhhh my godness, where a Heatbens?"
CmRih_VtVAs,me at school 0:12
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like Warner Bros finally learned to make a comic book movie right.
CmRih_VtVAs,"You need to add a few more characters like king shark, black spider, killer frost, KG beast. Your missing those characters, they were in assault on Arkham"
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO JOKER??!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Isn't Tom Hardy in this movie anymore?
CmRih_VtVAs,alguien me puede decir cuando saldra la pelicula
CmRih_VtVAs,"when the credits came up and when bohemian rhasphody was ending, the color of the credits and how he finished the song made me get images in my head i cant explain in human words."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Soooo, let's get this straight, the cops get the bad guys to do good things, because in doing these good things, they get to kill and hurt people, so it's a win win for everyone?

Also it looks amazing :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,How many times do I have to watch this?
CmRih_VtVAs,AHHHH SCOTT EASTWOOD 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,o hi britta
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me who is the real bad guy in this movie ? :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was thinking, maybe when Harley said, ""What was that? I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry... It's the voices. I'm kidding! That's not what they really said."" Maybe she was trying to throw everyone off, get the upper hand in the situation. I mean she used to be a professional psychiatrist! She's smart, and clever, also really funny!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,stfu! i love TØP but pls... this movie will be amazing and you only talking about heathens. this is not music video. go away.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Bohemian Rhapsody. Love it already.
CmRih_VtVAs,arima new member of the suicide squad

CmRih_VtVAs,Nothing against bohemian rapsity but they play that instead of the bomb ass soundtrack of this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will be so good I can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,i prefer marvel over dc but this looks like a good movie
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is that
CmRih_VtVAs,what are they going to do
CmRih_VtVAs,SHIT I HAVE SOME COMPETITION
CmRih_VtVAs,God the hype for this movie in the comment section is going crazy. It's either because of the song or the movie in general. Or both.
CmRih_VtVAs,Twenty one pilots brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, is that the REAL Suicide Squad?"
CmRih_VtVAs,oooooh.....MAMAAAAAAA
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 - Red Buttons.
CmRih_VtVAs,"it would have been so great if they got Jared Leto to sing a song for the soundtrack, him being the lead singer of 30 seconds to mars and all"
CmRih_VtVAs,2 mins 4 secs tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know how you get too grown so your brain starts adding logic to movies and it kinda takes away from your experience? I find that a real nice barrage of gunshots and destruction and superpowers negate all logic...I expect maximum pleasure from this movie, hehehe."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm literally obsessed with this movie already and its a few days before my birthday so im excited, I looked up so much shit about it and im kinda getting salty because now people are just gonna go see it because of TØP :/ like I love the new song and love them but its annoying.  BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY GAVE IT MORE ATTENTION SO BLESS

But let me just say I am VERY happy they got a good soundtrack for this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,heathens

CmRih_VtVAs,Not actually here because of Heathens. I actually just want to see the movie because I like the comics.
CmRih_VtVAs,hell yeah margot robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,What was the song in the back round
CmRih_VtVAs,No bands brought me here just comics
CmRih_VtVAs,why is it taking three fucking years for this shit to come out? 5 fucking months of previews? when does this fucking movie come out!?
CmRih_VtVAs,people here for twenty-one pilots-go away go listen to the song and leave this comment section alone
CmRih_VtVAs,skip to 2:06 thank me later
CmRih_VtVAs,We get that your bands are gonna be in this song. Can you all shut the fuck up now? We get it. We get that's why you're here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is so beautiful ugh
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't be the ONLY one who doesn't like the fact that the Joker doesn't look like a clown right? He looks cool, but he looks more like he's emo or something and less like a clown."
CmRih_VtVAs,sale luego😭😭

CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna see if Dc fucks up again or actually makes a good movie that doesn't bore me to death like Batman Vs Superman or make me hate a character because of how poorly represented they are just like lex luthor in BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,wow they used this song
CmRih_VtVAs,All my friends are eating steak it's slow...|-/
CmRih_VtVAs,I just hope this will be as good as we've been anticipating if to be.

CmRih_VtVAs,"So Harley Quinn,killer crock,desdshot, joker and...I don't know the the dude with fire...he looks like victor zsasz"
CmRih_VtVAs,at least it's not another batman movie
CmRih_VtVAs,As I heard BOHEMIAN RAPSODY my eyes filled up with tears!
CmRih_VtVAs,Sucker for Pain brought me here and I'm glad it did cuz now I can't wait to watch this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith seems out of place.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley fake with a baseball bat is just gr8
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,There hasn't been a good DC film since Dark Knight. I'm seriously hoping this won't be a pile of shit like Batman V Superman...
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS LOOKS FUCKING EPIC
CmRih_VtVAs,Thanks QWEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,i was just waiting for tyler joseph to pop out from somewhere oops

CmRih_VtVAs,Bad guys doing good for a day
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did the tøp fandom have to invade this comment section like cmon guys you're gonna ruin the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,All my friends are heathens take it sløw.......
CmRih_VtVAs,TØP + Suicide Squad is just perfection what a great time to be alive
CmRih_VtVAs,"THIS is how you market a movie, Ghostbusters. Learn."
CmRih_VtVAs,Of course there the worst heroes ever cuz there villans bas guys
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm most likely seeing this movie only for TØP and P!ATD.
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the ending song for this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,oh snap this is the thing from Arrow.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey, please check my last video, it's a masterpiece about suicide squad 😩🔥"
CmRih_VtVAs,"At first i thought Harley was being played by Emma Stone, but then i found out it was Margot Robbie"
CmRih_VtVAs,"am I the only one that can't stop watching this and heathens???? like seriously, help me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Terrible, suicide is the money invested in this garbage."
CmRih_VtVAs,music? 1:40
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why but ppl hav been doubting Will Smith IMO he is going to be FUCKING perfect. Based on what we've seen he is going to make an amazing deadshot.Jared Leto too I think he will make a fucking awesome Joker (not as good as Heath Ledger tho no one can top that guy.) I dont mind that Leto's Joker wont have scars.Also the silver teeth I think its fucking brilliant and thats another thing ppl did not like. Overall, as a die hard marvel fan this is one of the few Dc movies I have been looking forward to.And I kinda OVERhyped this movie cause Joker is my fav villian of all time."
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad or Guardians of the galaxy

CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm super excited for the movie, but the woman who plays Harley doesn't quite give me the ""original"" Harley vibe. Which her voice was kinda bubbly and such. Not looking for hate, just stating an opinion lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for the p!atd version of Bohemian Rhapsody

CmRih_VtVAs,Almost all of the comments are about TØP (My favorite band) and not the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly I'll take queens music in this trailer over 21 pilots no offense to them but every time I hear queens bohemian rhapsody I picture this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was already really excited for this movie (I've been waiting a year) and then I see the soundtrack and see that p!atd and tøp are gonna be in it, I swear to god, if I don't see this I'm gonna kill someone"

Whether you're seeing the movie for tøp and p!atd or because of the characters and the story, I hope you enjoy it (:"
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought they were supposed to use the twenty one pilots song
CmRih_VtVAs,proudest fap

stir.. and expect profits..

*yawn*  

same old formula..

CmRih_VtVAs,This movie clearly has a hard on for Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) otherwise she wouldn't be oversexualized like she is and in every scene

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2077291827/science-fiction-thriller-film-offering"
CmRih_VtVAs,harely quen is so HOT
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,that's  a nice song for a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,This is coming out on my birthday 😀
CmRih_VtVAs,"Garbage in,Garbage out"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 Green Arrow
CmRih_VtVAs,gaaah I came too late! Fuuuuuuck Harley Quinn I'm here. Wait what?! I gotta wait until August??😬
CmRih_VtVAs,"mcu's been around since 2008 with no movie about villains
dceu's 3rd movie is a movie about villains"
CmRih_VtVAs,Officially rates PG-13.
CmRih_VtVAs,the concepts seems really exciting but the trailer left me disappointed. maybe they used too famous of actors but the characters weren't believable to me.
CmRih_VtVAs,love suicide squad & hate wb. gonna watcha lotta for free.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a normal boy
I just saw cara delivign
And i'm ganna watchit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody , music perfect for trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Annalise Keating, you have trials to attend to!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really wanna see this
CmRih_VtVAs,"너무 기대됩니다.
이건 기대해도 실망 없을거 같은 영화"
CmRih_VtVAs,song name ??!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:23 - that shot is fucking amazing, doesnt even look like the joker in the other shots. Anyway, people need to remember, this isn't a continuation of Heath Ledgers joker. I mean when I first saw a picture of Jared Leto dressed up as the Joker months and months ago i literally said oh my god how fucking stupid. but this is a whole different character, this isn't even batman with a new joker. Lets all remember the joker character has been different in all movies - people just get stuck up on Heath Ledgers version (which is irreplaceable no doubt) but characters change = the way they look, act, talk and always have"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,well now I'm hyped to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,when does Harley Quinn get her own movie?!?!

CmRih_VtVAs,This is lit.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this movie just got up higher on my list :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"the song is called ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this is better than BvS it looks pretty good
CmRih_VtVAs,Boycott Scientology
CmRih_VtVAs,Tom Cruise approves this trailer. When people drop money on this SHIT you help fill the coffers of the wackiness that is the cult of L Ron.
CmRih_VtVAs,i like how the joker looks fr.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this movie doesnt fail. The dceu is counting on this

CmRih_VtVAs,Still the most badass trailer ive ever seen this year.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so cool 😎😎
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this Suicide Squad 2? Cause I didn't see Deathstroke nor Ravager. Or does Slade Wilson get a cameo?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The shot of Joker jumping to ""save"" Harley always give me chills."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now that this song has been in the trailer, would it be too much to have it in the movie somewhere, too?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Worse*
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 who's the girl ?
CmRih_VtVAs,what song?
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the trailer and I can't wait for the movie now!

CmRih_VtVAs,The Movie and Concept look dumb.....expecting another DC box office flop
CmRih_VtVAs,00:40 jerk…
CmRih_VtVAs,Jim Carrey shouldve been The Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker are back !
CmRih_VtVAs,I JUMPED UP DOWN AND SIDEWAYS WHEN THE VIDEO STARTED WITH QUEEN

CmRih_VtVAs,i saw this trailer so many times
CmRih_VtVAs,i saw this trailer so many times
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cara Delevign's acting is so cringey. Doesn't seem authentic, more like modeling."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck movie critics... They're destroying the diversity of art. Hope the reshoots didn't ruin and marvelize the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"How can no one know the name of this song? Come on guys, have none of you ever listened to Queen?"
CmRih_VtVAs,hmm...looks a bit underwhelming considering the hype
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm starting to believe this movie will be a sleeper hit.

CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone know what rating they think this will be
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath ledger is looking down and y'all best belive he is proud

CmRih_VtVAs,I don't get how could a doctor of mental illness the hardest thing to master she was smart and sane but when she hooked up with joker she turned into a insane dumbass don't get me wrong I love Harley Quinn but it doesn't make sense
CmRih_VtVAs,Love how they sync the sound effects with the song

CmRih_VtVAs,THIS WILL BE THE BEST DC MOVIE YET!!!!!!!!!!!!1

CmRih_VtVAs,"I""m really excited to not see this movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 when your getting a drink at night and don't want to wake your parents
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn the song men it's just the song
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Many great and memorable sayings have come out of movies: 'I'll be back', 'My Prescious', 'Let's Partae!, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn', etc. Now there is: 'We're bad guys, it's what we do.'"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man Will Smith still tryna act tough, I love it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is Quarude- Bohemastorm for those who don't know
CmRih_VtVAs,Dirty Dozen rip-off
CmRih_VtVAs,Damit Dc and Marvel get all my money.
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be rated like Deadpool right ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I want the panda suit scene to be awesome sooo badly!
CmRih_VtVAs,Dc Comics villains the bestT
CmRih_VtVAs,If you go to the Bohemian Rhapsody video and comment saying you are from here you are a bad person.
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is poison ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect soundtrack!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is a little bit unfair, If any movie use Bohemian Rhapsody as soundtrack will look like the fucking best movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait

CmRih_VtVAs,seria mehor con el guason de ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,bruh

CmRih_VtVAs,Is it me or does this remind me of bronsen
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that the joker and Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna see dis movie soooooo bad! >~<
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker sounded like The Joker in Dark Knight when he said ""I can't wait to show you my toys!"" RIP Mr Ledger. This Joker will honor you as you"
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,THAT MOVIE LOOKS HIGHKEY FYE😲😲🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Me watches Suicide Squad trailer...*  ""Yes!  Finally, a live action Warhammer 40,000 movie!  Margot Robbie as the Laughing God?  This is awesome!""  *Squints at screen...*  ""Wait... it says her name is H... Harley... Quinnn...  That has to be a spelling mistake, right.  They meant she's a *Harlequin*... right?  RIGHT?  *Cries*  ""F*ck you, Hollywood!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,literally the best movie trailer ever ! I just hope that they didn't show us the whole movie in the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've been waiting for this movie for so long. I didn't follow too much that was happening during development because I never thought tptb would ever actually make it and I didn't want to get my hopes up. Even during casting I hemmed and hawed about Jared Leto's Joker and Marie Robbie's Harley Quinn. I see this trailer and now and I am so excited!! If the movie is at least as good as this trailer, I'll be happy. TBH I am still a little concerned if this movie can contain Will Smith, IDK, but after this I'm willing to chance it. That was an excellent musical pairing with Bohemian Rhapsody too! Who'd have ever thought that such a great song would work as well for (at least) two totally different kinds of film? Even if you hate Wayne and Garth, you gotta admit that no other song could have possibly worked as well in that Wayne's World scene, and now here again in the Suicide Squad trailer. I wasn't overly happy with the first trailer partly because of the music, but of course here you see (more of) the finished movie with better music, it makes the whole thing looks a lot better. Fingers crossed! #SuicideSquad"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker.....I want one
CmRih_VtVAs,lo unico bueno del avance es bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Yay good thing it's in August so I can watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,From 1:19 to 1:24 is when you knew you're completely fucked by this psychotic killer.
CmRih_VtVAs,HECK YEAH IT'S BOHEMIAN FUCKING RHAPSODY
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one of the few movie trailers i watch over and over again. And it's all thanks to BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. LAAAVVVVEEEEE THIS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"For me, this is the movie that needs to be good for me to care about the DCCU. I never had high hopes for BvS (Zach Snyder was still directing, we never had a stand alone Batman reboot, the forced JL tie ins, etc.), but this one has a lot of potential. It has a solid cast, director, and so far both trailers have been very entertaining without giving away the plot of the movie. Not to mention I am really interested in seeing Jared Leto. If this one sucks, then I may be done with the DCCU for a while."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn fighting crime in panties, think I'll go see that"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is gonna look more discussing than ever in this movie. Prepare your anuses.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man , this movie is going to be AWESOME !"
CmRih_VtVAs,actually seems like a bad movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Batman in here ?
CmRih_VtVAs,At first I though captain boomerang was Tom hardy but NO it HAS to be jai Courtney
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm obsessed with the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yes, I wanna see that xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,i feel like this movie and the song are a great match!
CmRih_VtVAs,all of the trailers are badass because the joker and Harley Quinn are in all in the trailers? hahahahahahahahahaha.
CmRih_VtVAs,So you think you can love me and leave me to diiiieeeee????Best song and trailer combination ever!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,PLZZZ be PG-13
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really think this is one of the best action movie trailes ever, Suicide Squad could be the worst year's movie, but this trailer is awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hold my weave/hair piece 
I didn't just see who I thought I saw right??
Is that Cara!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad fans: ""OH MY GOD, A LIVE-ACTION VERSION OF HARLEY QUINN!!!!"" me: ""Birds of Prey did it first. Just saying!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer's good but the song is better
CmRih_VtVAs,"Favourite characters: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Joker/Batmen"
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing song choice in the trailer :)
CmRih_VtVAs,is tom hardy boomerang?
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't know Deadshot was black
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the jokers new look. Sue me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wanna see the 7 guys who didn't made the justice league team? Then watch Suicide Squad. ( I only watch the trailers because of the girl h
CmRih_VtVAs,I just love how they used Bohemian Rhapsody which is probably one of the best songs in existence.
CmRih_VtVAs,I REALLY TRIED TO HATE THIS BUT IT LOOKS SO GOOD
CmRih_VtVAs,*-----*
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought the broad was Ann Hathaway and I was about to be pissed... Whew that was close.
CmRih_VtVAs,I <3 suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Man I sang to that whole song because I love the band Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,I pray the sequel is rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,I could wait for it to hit the redbox
CmRih_VtVAs,I swore to myself I wouldn't give DC another chance but this looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,this just a normal night out with the boys
CmRih_VtVAs,2:12 umm daddy's little monster umm ok
CmRih_VtVAs,SO FUCKING EPIC!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"And the Independence Day fanboys crying and whining about Will Smith is greedy.. 

50mill isn't a shit compared to how big an of actor Will is.

When Suicide Squad comes out, everyone will forget about Independence Day, Im not gonna be shocked if Suicide Squad hits top 10 all time box office, just by seing the insane rates on the trailers already"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hype , just watched x-men , really dissapointed"
CmRih_VtVAs,"A cheezy, special FX knockoff of ""The Dirty Dozen""."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn!
CmRih_VtVAs,who luvs guns me who luvs fire me who luvs bad guys me who luvs me

CmRih_VtVAs,i have never been so keen for a movie😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,WHO isnt Firefly from the Batman Comics into the Squad ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith? Really? The dialog about voices in her head was so damn corny. This movie is gonna blow
CmRih_VtVAs,Why Harlequin and not Catwoman?
CmRih_VtVAs,who is killer crock?
CmRih_VtVAs,I need this in my life...I might be Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,this gives me chills
CmRih_VtVAs,Quinn look a litle bit like Jinx from LoL?
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA DELEVIGNE
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't know it was possible to ruin Harly Quin's character until now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevigne's in this???? 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,DOES CARA DELESOMETHING REALLY HAVE TO BE IN EVERY FREAKING MOVIE I WANNA WATCH!?!?!?!??! AAAAH
CmRih_VtVAs,love it
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song at 1:45 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,comes out on my birthday
CmRih_VtVAs,Croc's gonna die first
CmRih_VtVAs,"Come on, DC, get Suicide Squad to turn the tables. We can't have Marvel fans getting the hops."
CmRih_VtVAs,como se llaman las canciones
CmRih_VtVAs,"just from the fact that they put bohemian rhapsody in it, I know this movie is gonna rock."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith trying to be tough again... this is gonna suck.
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything is great and joker is worsttttttttt !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought The Suicide Squad was a platoon of men in the DC universe that were too dangerous to keep alive so they were sent on suicide missions that often included them fighting dinosaurs. https://www.google.com.au/search?q=star+spangled+war+stories+war+that+time+forgot&client=firefox-b&biw=1920&bih=947&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwichZHc9urMAhVDxxQKHRxcAiUQ_AUIBygB
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen made this watchable
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song at 1:38??
CmRih_VtVAs,I totally think Harley and Joker should have a seen where the song Crazy Little Thing Called Love plays in the back.
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect song choice
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my favorite movie trailer ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever...
CmRih_VtVAs,"One of the best trailers ever. I didn't care about this movie, then I saw this trailer, now I'm totally looking forward to seeing it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,There's  no way you could turn bad guys into heroes
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara 😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,I really wish they tried to have the Harley Quin accent
CmRih_VtVAs,EVERYTHING DUMB ASS!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is my favorite
CmRih_VtVAs,BAD-ASS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The idea of Suicide Squad didn't sound interesting at all to me, but after watching this trailer, I gotta say: This looks like it will be a freaking fantastic movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is Bae <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly can not wait. I mean I have seen T.V. shows with the Suicide Squad, but this is going to be really good."
CmRih_VtVAs,who ever decided to put Queen in the trailer should get a raise
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith made a good choice with this movie. Any other movie he is in will flop, cause he and his wife are millionaire crybabies. This movie would do well without him."
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name? x3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Stupid fucking name for anything let alone a movie, fuck off. Call it something else for fuck sake. How unconscious do you have to be?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"amazing trailer, but was that the joker?
if it was then thats the most generic joker gimmick ive seen in years"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really can't wait to watch the movie I have watched the both trailer 10000000 times
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this movie gonna be awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody turned it from amazing to AHMAYZINGG
CmRih_VtVAs,2:04 the best scene
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN NOT WAIT TILL FUCKING AUGUST (have watched this trailer  over 100 times)
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to torrent this shit!
CmRih_VtVAs,Like si vienes por Queen :v
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is my girlfriend
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST. TRAILER. EVER. CAN T WAIT FOR THE MOVIEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,should have use the actors form arrows since its a rip off of their suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,are they just gonna kill themselves
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian rhapsody. As a member of a marching band, that is my FAVORITE song."
CmRih_VtVAs,God damnHarley
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why don't people like this Joker, he looms like he's having the time of his life!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh look! A trailer with a female lead! All those likes are sexist!
CmRih_VtVAs,Brittany v:
CmRih_VtVAs,como se llama la cancion?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder which robin is going to be in the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing trailer and August 5th is too far away
CmRih_VtVAs,I think someone will kick Avengers ass :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can you, please, make it not in 3D?"
CmRih_VtVAs,She is the farthest thing from Harley Quinn besides how she looks. I have a strong feeling this is gonna suck asshole.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm going for Harley and the joker and slipknots death only😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit at 1:38-1:39 Katana couldn't lock up the Darkness.
CmRih_VtVAs,YAAAAASSS THEY USED BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY MY FAVE SONG I'M SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,Rated R?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is hot😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Translation: ""We're trying so so hard to be Guardians of the Galaxy... except darker and grittier and sexier, and without any of the likable characters! PLEASE LIKE US!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,dc is do dumb for changing their logo right now
CmRih_VtVAs,if its an 18 I think it should be a 12+ because its a DC
CmRih_VtVAs,"so today i found out that Harley Quinn is played by ""Margot Robbie"", this whole time i thought it was ""Jaime Pressly"".... does anyone else think they look alike a lot even when they talk?"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 groot ???
CmRih_VtVAs,good song
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody!!❤❤❤❤
CmRih_VtVAs,papa john
CmRih_VtVAs,"better ingreeedienats

CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is fucking hott
CmRih_VtVAs,We want heath ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,"este trailer lo vi en el cine UVK,  antes de ver superman vs batman, y la vrdd q fue alucinante, porq no fui el unico que se puso a corear la canción  en ese momento! y con esos parlantes...waoo alucinante!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Please stop casting Joel Kinnaman in action movies he's shockingly mediocre and that grill on Joker was a poor choice  other than that this film is going to be a master piece and competitive with the Nation's Mouse God Disney-Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,why do i keep seeing emma watson at 1:52 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I came for Queen and Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol the voices
CmRih_VtVAs,I prefer the J.L.A version of dead shot /capt boomerang...but i don't have millions to spend on a movie so that will doo pig
CmRih_VtVAs,Because why assign a Special Forces group like the Navy Seals or the Army Rangers to do a job when you can offer a group of extremely dangerous criminals freedom if they do it instead?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""aha sorry.. the voices""
Me too harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Doctor Strange trailer - Marvel trying to be like DC

Suicide Squad trailer - DC trying to be like Marvel"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey Warner Bros, you gave whoever cut these trailers a promotion, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone know what it is rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry, but seeing as the last guy that played the Joker pretty much died from his role, I don't think Mr. 30 seconds to Mars is gonna cut it for me. Just saying, he is a very short guy, not intimidating at all."
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone who play lol MUST see Jinx in her haha xD
CmRih_VtVAs,im more of a marvel fan and i dont like dc but i want to see this movie bc of harley but at the same time i hate joker gnskghshouf
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody??
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody :')
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to watch this.
CmRih_VtVAs,hey! do you know that this movie premiers in august 5?! in my birthday?!
CmRih_VtVAs,who wants to trade?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is this the real life
is this just fantasy
caught in a landslide
no escape from reality"
CmRih_VtVAs,is that Cara Delevigne at 1:53?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Here let me start something: 

I'm calling it: 40% Rotten rating, it won't make much more that MOS at most, DCEU won't win their future! 

Am I doing it right? Nothing on you Warner, just imitating the haters."
CmRih_VtVAs,Missing Heath Ledger.......
CmRih_VtVAs,what the heck.... mama Mia
CmRih_VtVAs,that song tho! 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one of the best trailers I have ever seen and I can't wait to see it looks amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The worst thing about this movie is that there's no mistakes, so pumped"
CmRih_VtVAs,i like the trailer is good well edited and the song choice is amazingly well fitted my only objection would be harley's character doesn't come of right to me she has to be one of my favourites in the originals and the animated movie  Assault on Arkham and the character just doesn't seem right
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks fire 🔥🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is Batman in it? I thought this was a team of 'bad guys', the Suicide Squad.. Kinda kills the whole deal. There are already a bunch of flicks with Batman in it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs up if you think Margot Robbie is going to steal this flick !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hated the new trailer, but now it's grown on me. But, I still prefer that darker aspect of the DC comics."
CmRih_VtVAs,Plz let it be pg 13
CmRih_VtVAs,whats The song
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't contain my happiness
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie, just looks, so bad..."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,They picked the best song for this trailer!!! 🤘🏼😌
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie should be edited as creatively as this trailer was. I wish there was more movies edited like Scott Pilgrim. Deadpool, Suicide Squad, Guardians of the Galaxy... All these meta infamous- team-of-anti-heroes blockbusters could have much more entertaining value, box-office appeal and  risk-taking creative recognition if only the editing of those movies was paced by the soundtrack and with the sound environment which implies the sound editing and the sound mixing to have a multitude of different rhythms constantly changing depending on the emotional tone of the scene in question and that, all alone, would represent countless hours of tedious work but this kind of musical editing shouldn't be limited to a trailer or to an opening credit sequence, it should be expanded to an entire movie from start to finish with an awarenesss of when it's getting f*cking annoying and when it adds to a scene or a transition."
CmRih_VtVAs,I see Jinx in Real Life ROLF
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my to-oys.."""
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't believe they ever considered Emma Roberts for Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie is perfect in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 is my favorite part. When Joker Jumps to save Harley Quinn. Man! He's got a heart.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, it's what we do"" I love Harley quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,Have it been aired?
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:52 that girl she is in the leaves , she is sitting down brown hair. She's from arrow lmao its the exact same clip . Its oliver ex gf from the island 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:42 I am groot
CmRih_VtVAs,The most funny thing is when I was listening Bohemian Rhapsody song and suddenly the urgent need to watch this trailer was REAL 😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,*i want the song*
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Will fucking Smith. Looks like it could have been a good movie but then.... Will fucking Smith.
CmRih_VtVAs,Does any one know what the names of the songs ??
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks pretty dumb!
CmRih_VtVAs,si hay un oscar para los trailers este se lo lleva
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Joker looks really weird they should have made him better
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the villains in the movie that is not the Suicide Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Conclusion:this movie looks like overproduced,lowest common denominator,will smith garbage."
CmRih_VtVAs,They nailed the trailer with that song!! Fits Perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,She has a nice ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, this trailer looks good, but BvS also did"
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST...TRAILER...EVER!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why
CmRih_VtVAs,I actually love this version of Bohemian Rhapsody so much!
CmRih_VtVAs,Was a good cast until jared leto popped up. Might be worth watching for Will Smith and Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"Also, this Joker reminds me somehow of the Mask."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't like actors where I can spot the ""acting"".  WIll is the champion there."
CmRih_VtVAs,Misleading title where's the suicide
CmRih_VtVAs,I would be mr boomerang XD with the drink
CmRih_VtVAs,bohiem raphsody i think
CmRih_VtVAs,Best edited trailer i ever seen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love it :DDDD

CmRih_VtVAs,Worst. Film. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh! Mama mia , mama mia"
CmRih_VtVAs,Pretty colours :D
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is good only because they added that song. The movie is gonna suck.
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN always goes so well with violent movies! can't wait for ticket pre sales !!!!! Jared Lego is definitely going to show us the younger more criminal Joker. and Harley Quinn nuff said!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I always seem to see something new each time I see this trailer, probably because everything is so rapid fire that I can barely understand what is happening."
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who's gonna watch only because of Jared leto??? :) oh he is genius :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, who's going to take out the Material Defender? OS-114? I think not."
CmRih_VtVAs,The clown girl is sexy
CmRih_VtVAs,they should not use a good song for a trailer.... can't pay attention to trailer... singing along!!   lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and amazing cast! One love
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody!
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,"at 2:07 the quote ""si vis pacum para berllum"" is it hinting the punisher???"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This I can call MOVIE!  All good stuuf,big project and even cost millions to view I am sure everyone will do anything for watch it it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,any time you hear Bohemian Rhapsody..its a good thing!.. but why do we have to wait  til august>?? grrr!!

CmRih_VtVAs,Two of the hottest women on the planet in one movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why so many dislikes?
CmRih_VtVAs,I was excited for this but batman vs super man disappointed me so I'm pretty sure this will too
CmRih_VtVAs,This fucking sucks. That is all.
CmRih_VtVAs,Please be good!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara??
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to watch that only for Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, so is this Suicide Squad film going to take place around the same time as Batman V Superman? If so... That's pretty cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,This reminds me of APB Reloaded
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so good it gives me chills. just like in the song!
CmRih_VtVAs,jjsjsjjssj soy laoka
CmRih_VtVAs,jjsjsjjssj soy laoka

CmRih_VtVAs,My life is complete now
CmRih_VtVAs,1:51 is that Alex Mercer from Prototype :v
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC = Suicide Squad
Marvel = Guardian Of The Galaxy"
CmRih_VtVAs,That drink guy 😂😂😂 I can't stop laughing
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna crap on Captain America Civil War
CmRih_VtVAs,Song
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see it 😃😃😃😃
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this film
CmRih_VtVAs,"at 2:07 you can see one of the shirts says para bellum, which is part of the name for the 9mm cartridge,  but i know you didnt care about anything at that point"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Queen •Bohemian Rhapsody•
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to watch this already!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,A movie 'bout bad guys becoming good guys or trying(not) to be. Seems legit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley just needs more of an ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen, song is best"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wonder Woman ..Harley Quinn ...stealing the spotlight this year!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody is what make this trailer awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear this is DCs last hope
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can not wait till this comes out,its ganna be epic,and great even cooler that it has will smith and he's my favorite actor out there"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie looks like a goddess as Harley Quinn. A lot of people has a problem with how she's dressed but the way she's dressed makes her look that much more hotter. I loved when she bent over to grab that purse out of the store window. I'm really looking forward to this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:06 .....
the moment when you just want to tackle :) :) :)
Margot simply indescribably beautiful ....."
CmRih_VtVAs,"IM SO HYPED TO WATCH!!
1 Bad point though i dont like what they did to the joker :s"
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow the only main girl in here is just known as ""jokers girlfriend"", she has the stereotypical ""girls are crazy"" character and she is dressed like a prostitute , I thought this was 2016 lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx is on the Suicide Squad xD
CmRih_VtVAs,wow marvel made a funny movie that had a funny super hero that wasn't really a hero. Do you know what is better than that? A funny movie that has a few funny super heros that aren't actually heros.
CmRih_VtVAs,B movie bollocks
CmRih_VtVAs,lol what happened to Joker's eyebrows?
CmRih_VtVAs,cuando se estrena?
CmRih_VtVAs,Me and my friends were singing this and were so into the trailer without realizing how loud we were singing this so we yelled out.... here!! As the song quickly ends there and everyone just looked and someone when like yeah!! I don't blame you lol!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie will bomb harder than Batman V Superman, people will watch it, and it will be just as stupid, and Will Smith wont win an Oscar for his lousy performance confirmed #nevergonnagetit #Blacklivesmatter #moviegonnasuck"
CmRih_VtVAs,Battlefield 1
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Still not convinced Margot Robbie will be a good Harlequin
CmRih_VtVAs,hey. this movie looks good.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg i cant wait too see this freaking movie!!!>_<
CmRih_VtVAs,"Classic music, bad guys transformed into heroes.. They copy this from The guardians of galaxy come on..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"can't believe people ar blind or no-one see's this but at 0:01 the faded letters spell out ""FIRM BUT AIR"" thought it was funny"
CmRih_VtVAs,rip cod
CmRih_VtVAs,Battlefield 1 trailer was better
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg yess! 
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Joker will be the antagonist of the movie because we never see him with soldiers, nor we seem him in a prison. He was also surrounded with thugs (or some other villains, I have no idea), unlike other villains, who appear as a group. In my opinion, Joker will try to separate Harley from the rest of the group (because of his interest towards her) and will be oriented towards her (as a subplot). The basis for my assumtions are the three trailers currently released. Forgive me for ortographic faults, if I have any, because english is not my native tongue."
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol you want views just play a Freddie mercury song
CmRih_VtVAs,I love marvel but darker settings is always a good thing
CmRih_VtVAs,annnnd I'm on board for Leto's Joker... He looks great and seems legit.. plus I heard he gave the crew chills while he was in front of the camera.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm really wanting this movie to be good. This looks like DC hope to turn things around... it's like the GOTG of DC...... and I can't believe I'm about to type this but Jai Courtney may have found his role... 😱
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great. Now i can't listen to Bohemian Rhapsody without people saying ""oh you seen the new trailer for suicide squad?"" like i just discovered that song from the trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,So proud to be a Dc fan boy
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this.  Suicide Squad is my shit and Harley Quinn is my main bitch
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably the only one who thinks this looks juvenile and awful. Borderline movie bait that will not deliver. The lines are just so corny.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie comes out on my birthday...!!! best birthday EVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im against rape, but the like button had it coming"
CmRih_VtVAs,Never has there been a movie I wanted to see more in my life than this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kinda sad Harley isn't speaking in a high pitched voice. I really hope this movie doesn't ruin her character. I'm sure she'll do a good job at her portrayal, but I'm a bit nervous."
CmRih_VtVAs,"so what? are they trying to say this is how harley and the joker met? are we just going to completetly gloss over the actual way they met? and harley just seems all wrong, i dont know, hope it's good, but not holding much hope"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait too see the cape crusader again, Benn Affleck nailed it. Hope that they don't change the mood of the movie as well, keep it the way it was intended. Looks awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,My Favorite song ever! ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN´T WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Harley fighting against joker?? They're my OTP :(((
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am so sick of will smith playing will smith, please tell me you didn't oversaturate the support role of deadshot"

CmRih_VtVAs,song min 1:46 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Personally, just for looking the trailer I don't like Margot's personification of Harley Queen, it looks like she is overacting
Harley Queen is more natural, to much crappy dialogue"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I have the Halloween custome for dis year lol
CmRih_VtVAs,TOTALLY WATCHING THAT!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this pg13 or something? I know it's not anything under that.

CmRih_VtVAs,The shot where Joker is falling in that green pit was DOPE!!
CmRih_VtVAs,So testosterone boys and Harley Quinn giiiiiirls
CmRih_VtVAs,PewDiePie have more subscriber than Warner Bros. Pictures
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is gonna be sick but i still wish they had made a batman movie prior to this that had both the joker and harley quinn in it  when christian bale was still batman the Christopher Nolan batman movies were so awesome i love how he made it as if they were real not like they turned the comic into a movie like when they had riddler and two face or when clooney played batman smh (batman and robin was hands down the worst batman movie..aside from the oldschool batman with adam west)..i hope they do make a separate film still with joker and harley against the bat bc if done right it could be so bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"Soooooo hyped for Suicide Squad. i thought I was really excited for Batman V. Superman and Captain America Civil War, but this is where it is. Jared Leto is going to be a great Joker. of course not better than Heath Ledgers performance but It might match up pretty close. Marvel is flying into the dust with these new movies. (Just my opinion), RISE OF THE DC FAN CLUB!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHASPODY WAS PLAYING AND I SCREAMED
CmRih_VtVAs,desde el 1:38 pasan las escenas que te hacen desear esta pelicula
CmRih_VtVAs,Who noticed that joker saves Harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,This is by far the best way to incorporate Bohemian Rhapsody into a trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,I was looking up fan made Vids and I found one that was basically like this one and was made before this one  Illuminati confirmed 😵
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie should have been directed by Tim Burton. He is the one that can make a balanced dark at atmosphere without falling in the ""ewwww"" area.."
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone know what this movie is rated cuz I'm only 11 and I can only see movies that are pg13
CmRih_VtVAs,beware of the panda
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it me or am I the only person that finds Leto's Joker attractive? 🤐🤐🤔🤔
CmRih_VtVAs,tho y would superman even become evil? 🤔
CmRih_VtVAs,what is this song called?
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Bohemian Rhapsody plays in the movie as well.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope Poison Ivy is in the sequel!

CmRih_VtVAs,please@
CmRih_VtVAs,Jesus this looks like shit. No wonder there's not a decent actor in this. David Ayer shouldn't be directing superhero movies. Margot Robbie doesn't embody Harley Quinn. Will Smith needs to stop trying to be a superhero. The fuck is the soundtrack they're trying to implement here? Fucking shit DC get Christopher Nolan back on your projects. Looks about as good as Jonah Hex. Gagh.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, I think this movie is gonna be shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is Deadshot's mechanical eye in the wrong side???????  This will bug me for the whole movie I think..
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is this witch lady and the guy with the fire powers?
CmRih_VtVAs,"At least 70% of the views this trailer has, are mine"

CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite part is from 0:00 to 2:31
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto is 44 years old, Ben Affleck is 43 years old. Jared looks so young even when compared to Ben and Henry without make up."
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker went gangsta in dis movie and got a grill...Harley Quinn is da shitt
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52

CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is going to be so epic, it will blow everyone away because people don't expect as much from this as BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,"MAN, I love this trailer. :) <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,What this movie means is: we need evil ppl to stop evil?
CmRih_VtVAs,So its now funny and using 2 songs from Wayne's World in their newer trailers? LMFAO how stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,not a DC fan but I think this movie is awesome!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,she dosnt even have harley quinns fucking voice ughhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:25 I swear jokers laughter is so fucking awesome, gives me the chills of excitement"
CmRih_VtVAs,Slip Knot dies early in the movie confirmed! He is not in the thumbnail!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now, this is a story all about how

CmRih_VtVAs,SUICIDE SQUAD + QUEEN =PERFECTION 
CmRih_VtVAs,O por dios 😮
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably gonna be shit but I'll watch it for Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,So are they good guys know or still bad guys ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Was Batman vs Superman epic?No but it was good enough considering it was
 first movie with DC heroes together.Will SUICIDE SQUAD be 
better?Absolutely but JL movies will be even better.For all of those who
 make negative statement for recent DC movies there is only 1 logical 
explanation:MARVEL fans.Go watch and comment your movies losers because 
DC will always dominate you"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:52 IS THAT CLINT EASTWOODS SON????
CmRih_VtVAs,Kisses:3
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker is beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the name of the song at the beginning
CmRih_VtVAs,This film looks so god damn gooooooooood
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this film. I saw BvS 3x cause it's so good! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Brittany Murphy would have killed as Harley yet Margot Robbie is a great choice too. I just wish ledger never killed himself cuz him and Brittany would make a great Harley and joker
CmRih_VtVAs,queen! lml xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared is the best joker ever!❤️ did i just saw scott eastwood ?? Margot robbie , you slay girl 👌😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you put Queen and Margot Robbie´s ass in one thing, you have it all done."

CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, that's what we do!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Is anyone else just reawatching and reawatching it
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer EVA
CmRih_VtVAs,"he says ""your a witch"" while hes next to enchantress, & reading the files. really? tell me yall dont catch that"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a bad feeling about this movie. I'm afraid they will fuck up the characters.
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that a giant panda at 01.42?
CmRih_VtVAs,I want a muffin
CmRih_VtVAs,gogogogogogooo
CmRih_VtVAs,i kinda wish they picked someone else for joker. or try to make him look lik the one from arkham series

CmRih_VtVAs,Wtf?there is bat man or its a fake one again?(they love to do fake batmans)
CmRih_VtVAs,How many chicks are gonna be harley Quinn for Halloween now... Whatta bore! 😴
CmRih_VtVAs,""" I can't wait to show ya my toys"" and him slapping him while saying it makes it all da betta :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Im getting Guardians of the Galaxy vibes... i LIKE IT!
CmRih_VtVAs,That song made it so perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,The songs in a movie trailer irritate me so much. They just break the whole scenario. I just hope the director doesn't ruin the movie with that.
CmRih_VtVAs,Emma Roberts was offered the role or Harley Quin and turned it down to be on Scream Queens...
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker and Harley Quinn are already my favorite characters
CmRih_VtVAs,that is cool I love Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"One of the best sound editing  in a trailer. Seriously, the perfect matched music tempo with actual scenes makes me put this movie on my must-watch list."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't like when comics focus on the villains instead of the heroes, so to me a movie where all the protagonists are villains is, well let's just say I will not watch it"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks like the most epic and awesome movie ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,I would rather kill myself than commit suicide
CmRih_VtVAs,harleen quinzel
CmRih_VtVAs,"Since when the joker hair become green and the red smile on mouth gone and the teeth is weird , I prefer the joker from The Dark Knight"
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here for Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,wrong song
CmRih_VtVAs,I've heard King Shark will be in this movie. Is it really true?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:42 panda panda panda.... I GOT BROADS IN ATLANTA
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite part is in exactly 2:08 trust me it is
CmRih_VtVAs,"MY DARK KNIGHT IS RISING AT 2:07, XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this song is in the movie :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can someone please tell which volumes of the comics is the ss movie based on. Is it based on the old comics dating back from the 80's, the recent ones or a combination of both? I want to read the comic before the movie comes it seem like an awesome movie but im aslo intrested in the orgins of each ss members"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is your fav character in Suicide Squad? My personal fav is El Diablo
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker has a purple Lamborghini and enjoys being shirtless? What universe is this? Metal teeth... Where's the pimp cane to go with? I'm sorry but this is not Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I helped produce this fine movie, I hope you all enjoy our hard work to put a movie like this together, can't wait to see it with an actual audience."
CmRih_VtVAs,Excellent song choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,All the comments on Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,the bitch playin harley and will smith need to goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
CmRih_VtVAs,This song makes me want to watch Wayne's World
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hear's bohemian rhapsody, ""I'm gonna like this film."""

CmRih_VtVAs,"01:08 the way she says ""woah"" and the way she's standing is so cute... haha"
CmRih_VtVAs,If only heath ledger was still alive...
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Suicide Squad"" was in Arrow too :) with deadshot too :) (i know its both DC, im just saying that) :3 :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dhe most pernicious image of all is dhe Ices Squad: A creation of commodity culture, it allows us to buy into an inauthentic simulation of suicidal praxis: Dhe group encourages passive spectating and martyrdom becomes anodher product to be consumed∴"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie pulls of Harley Quinn so perfectly! Just how I envisioned her in real life from the comics!
CmRih_VtVAs,good trailer but the movies still probably gona suck.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody is about suicide. This movie is titled ""Suicide Squad"". Genius! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:05 is EXACTLY what I didn't want to see hear. It's just overdoing it. Super cringy
CmRih_VtVAs,I think we all know who will in an Oscar this year...
CmRih_VtVAs,"The conversation I have with my friends about going to see this movie. 

Me: hey, you wanna go see suicide squad?

Friend: do you wanna go see it just because of Harley Quinn?

Friend: damn it Mike! Why does your horniness get in the way of going to the movies!"

CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks so badass, so much crazy yet fun stuff. Hope it doesn't disappoint like DoJ."

CmRih_VtVAs,i just cant freaking wait.. harley is my life.
CmRih_VtVAs,the subway monster is the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, a DC movie that looks fun. (Even if it is that grey color.)"
CmRih_VtVAs,As long as they're making these trailers with music I kinda wanna see them do king for a day by greenday :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"If it doesn't last like at least 3h, I am going to be very disappointed..."

CmRih_VtVAs,"I really want this movie to be good. especially after BvS ended up being garbage. but everything about it strikes me as ""trying too hard"""
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm getting so hyped!
CmRih_VtVAs,Squad goals 💯
CmRih_VtVAs,I like this one better than the new one
CmRih_VtVAs,Ive lost my faith to humanity for not knowing this song. I mean this is after all one of the best songs ever and everyone should know this instead of those fucking anaconda and gangman style
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else think Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is kind of shit?  sure she's talented and sex but she doesn't come off as a good Harley Quinn imo.
CmRih_VtVAs,So you think can stop me and spit in me eye
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn is bae
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is the best movie ever even tho it hasnt even come out yet

CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 **PAUSE**
CmRih_VtVAs,"Its not my theory but one i agree with, that the joker in this is actually jason todd. Which explains the absence of the red hood , and the robin costume in Batman V Superman that has ""Ha Ha , the jokes on you"" written on it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Where do i find the song????
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sorry but this was a horrible trailer

CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite part was when bohemian rhapsody was showing... My fav song
CmRih_VtVAs,that girl looks like jinx
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I'm assembling a team. They're all shamed actors that are looking for redemption in a flashy superhero movie. We're talking about real fuck-ups.

Will Smith, who thought it would be a good idea to mess up his own career to give his son Jaden a starring role... *in an M. Night Shyamalan film.*

Jai Courtney,  the blandest actor in Hollywood, who has starred in some of the worst action movies of the last 5 years. Including ""Terminator Genysis, ""A Good Day To Die Hard, and ""I, Frankenstein"".

Jared Leto, who used his Oscar speech to plug his crappy band. Seriously, he thanked ""30 Seconds To Mars"" DURING THE OSCARS.

Adewale Akinnvouye-Agbaje, who left ""Lost"" and forced the to kill off Mr. Eko - who was, like, the best part of the show at that point.

And Joel Kinnamam, who actually agreed to star in the Robocop remake!

If these miscreants can band together and complete their impossible mission: create a fun, profitable comicbook blockbuster utilizing a 70's pop soundtrack, they will be known from that day as the GUARDIANS OF- I mean, uh, SUICIDE SQUAD!""

-From Cracked"

CmRih_VtVAs,yo solo vengo por queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Something sticks out to me, but it's the kind of thing that I don't want to really judge until I've seen it in the movie, and that would be Harley. I dunno, she doesn't really come of as feeling like Harley Quinn to me, she doesn't talk like her, she just acts like a regular ditsy blonde, and her outfit is....it's to give the horny teenagers something to look at and not much else. Again, I don't wanna say it's a bad representation of the character, I still want to see if it feels like a Harley Quinn-esque character in the movie. And if she doesn't fit the Harley bill in the movie but is still a fun character in the movie, I won't be complaining about that either."
CmRih_VtVAs,what do the chemicals that harley & joker-(jason todd-robbin) do to them after there go in it? does it make them immortal? tjats what i read somewhere..
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quim is hot

CmRih_VtVAs,"This is one of those perfect trailers.  It gives away practically nothing, but makes me want to see a movie I wasn't quite sold on before.  Seriously, film execs should hire whomever cut this, it's brilliant."

CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not much of a superhero fan, but this got me hyped!"
CmRih_VtVAs,PERFECT !
CmRih_VtVAs,As a Batman admirer i have to admit that snyder shouldnt be EVER again touch his filthy hand on any character of DC comic
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Mila Kunis or Cara Delevingne would have been much better for Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie doesn't look good as Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,heard that they are adding action scenes and making it also a bit funnyer.
CmRih_VtVAs,i love this . omg cara!
CmRih_VtVAs,Should've been heath ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) raises her pinky while she sips here tea lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANNOT wait for this to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the girl?? She is so f*ck**g beautiful! 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,kick ass !
CmRih_VtVAs,So if they're the worst of the worst who are they fighting that would warrant them being brought together as a team? I'm seriously wanting to figure this out. The trailer doesn't explain shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"something more intense is finding nemo...
its a story about a  man who's wife and kids were killed be a murderer and only one of his kids survived, one day nemo was captured by a kidnapper. While marlon is following the killer he bumped into a woman who's mentally challenged who helped him to find his son only to see his son dead and loose hope and eventually his son .... uugh i cant continue hmm anyone want to continue the story?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"so.. DC villains were together fighting evil while marve ""SUPERHEROES"" fighting each other? :v 
and deadpool just be deadpool i guess.."
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who sang along?
CmRih_VtVAs,How do people think this looks good? This looks like trash.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know who I'm most excited to see. 
.........................

(Cough) (cough) Batman."
CmRih_VtVAs,4me 4me 4me 4meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
CmRih_VtVAs,"i wanna start something...hmm marvel is better than DC.


wrong idea"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm pretty damn excited....... Oh lord 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nice, they destroyed Bohemian Rhapsody."
CmRih_VtVAs,I really WANT to see this movie :3 ♥♥♥ Anybody with me?
CmRih_VtVAs,CAN'T WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIT  *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,is that Atomic skull in 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn it, they replace Tom Hardy with Jai."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I watched this like 23 times, who else is hyped up for this movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks really good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone watching this after watching the 3rd trailer? :P
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 : my friends are dying but who gives fuck?  I'll drink coke first 😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love Margot Robbie and Karen Fukuhara, my two fave heroine in DC franchise XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who came back from the new trailer ????
CmRih_VtVAs,look like a cool movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Feel like the movie is going to suck
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow so they're making the batman villains from DC a retarded version of the xmen... woo glad I'm skipping this piece of shit. Garbage. Pure garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,"So sick, demonic, and ugly. Good for teens and little mommy pappy boys."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let me think of a joke...








Batman V Superman:Dawn Of Justice"
CmRih_VtVAs,from the title I thought it was just gonna be people falling off towers
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully this will be DC's suicidal mission to get any support after BVS failure.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks bad. The trailer focused on jokes and action and nothing on what the general plot was. Movies that usually do this means that there really is no story and the movie will be mediocre at best or complete garbage at worst. Before you call me a DC hater or Marvel fanboy, I think the Marvel movies have been pretty mediocre or just awful. Avengers 1, Iron Man 1, and Cap 2 are the only ones I'd call good."
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST FILM TRAILER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ashley Costello should have been Harley tbh..
Who agrees?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"i love that choose Bohemian Rhapsody as song for this trailer ...
What a song,, yet still wonder how lots of pepple  donot know about this great song"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is an insult to freddie mercury.
CmRih_VtVAs,Only for Harley love !
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looking forward to it but
That's a sad song though 😿"
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA😍😃😍😍😃😃😜😜🙂😍😍😍😍😍😃😃😃😃
CmRih_VtVAs,Disgusting. you detach from reality further n further bcoz u r scared little pusses afraid to face the real life monsters! ud rather die chocking on popcorn than as heros fighting the evil
CmRih_VtVAs,why da fuck is will smith in this. they all complain there isn't enough black actors in Hollywood.that's cos the same people take all the roles. fuck off will and jada and maybe let some new talent in.
CmRih_VtVAs,IDI NAXUI SUKA BLEAD ONE LOVE MARGO ROBBI
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite part is the sound of that can opening at 1:35
CmRih_VtVAs,can.not.wait.need.see.now.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see this!
CmRih_VtVAs,tratando de buscar un puto comentario en español
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the songs name in the beginning?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's betting that this movie is going to do better at the box office than Batman v Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Get this out... NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,I need to watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited!
CmRih_VtVAs,"i was really wanting to see suicide squad, but know with the genius touch of bohemian rhapsody is impossible to don't watch it. This movie was ok i will probabily see this to hell yeah i will watch it and for the first time ever will smith will not be will smith omg"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm So Excited for this movie! It even comes out on my birthday!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The use of Bohemian Rhapsody was very jarring, I don't know why."
CmRih_VtVAs,11k terrified marvel fans😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Christian Bale and Heath Ledger will always be my Batman and Joker. No one is going to even come close to how well they did in TDK.
CmRih_VtVAs,THE NEW TRAILER IS EPIC ! CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad is going to save DC from that terrible Dawn of Justice movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Do they give awards for trailers? Because this one deserves all of them. Been watching this all day
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this basically Dc's deadpool?
CmRih_VtVAs,New trailer tonight🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,The movie better be awesome like the trailer xD
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like Macaulay Culkin. I guess Kevin got weird after he was left home alone.
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait first batmanvsuperman now this great time to be a dc fan
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm convinced that Queen was born to sing Bohemian Rhapsody so it could be in this trailer. It all fits so perfectly together.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 Aww!! It's a heart!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet 2:05 was everyones favorite part haha
CmRih_VtVAs,Will batman use his drones in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,new tráiler :D
CmRih_VtVAs,go fuck yourselfie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just take my money, lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only person that thought the teaser looked better
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be so much better than b.v.s . Can't wait too see the joker in full action.
CmRih_VtVAs,they all batman villain right ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna see this hella bad 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 this shit looks hella good
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the trailer they're saying has all the comedic bits from the movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Let me get this straight Batman and Superman both get there correct trademark colors for their suits but Harley Quinn can't get her original trademark red and black color scheme????😅What the hell dc
CmRih_VtVAs,The dislike bar is the size of the haters tiny penises(or boobs)
CmRih_VtVAs,New trailer coming soon!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith being dead shot is a complete joke, they really had nobody else in mind to be dead shot? like really nobody? and  Harley Quinn like they didn't have nobody better either? I mean she's ok but I'm not over exaggerating like everyone claiming she's an awesome Harley Quinn..she's ok at least"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is doing a awesome job on anti hero movies. Hope this movie would be perfect and they can make more movies like death stroke.
CmRih_VtVAs,What if they instead used the Kanye West version of bohemian rhapsody for this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,best edited trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Boá tarde
CmRih_VtVAs,Boá tarde
CmRih_VtVAs,rite at the helicopter's anti-aircraft countermeasures is where I super jizz!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto laugh as a joker is good,but he will never be able to top Ledger psycho laugh."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Harley sippin her tea reading a book is at the end of the movie. After they've defeated whatever they had to fight and when they go back to their prison cells with little rewards, like Harley's little Harlequin book. Cause she definitely didn't have blonde and pink in the beginning of the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,There's no reason I should've been more hyped for this movie (even before this trailer mind you) than anything I've seen from Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,🎯🎯🎯NEW TRAILER TONIGHT with the song BALLROOM BLITZ🎯🎯🎯
CmRih_VtVAs,The suicide squad members get along cuz their mothers` names r Martha!
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype is real...but it comes out in august...its only april...
CmRih_VtVAs,Spoiler!! Joker dies and when harley quinn puts dirt on his coffin its gonna rise at the final shot
CmRih_VtVAs,"batman v superman was good. but so was man of steel. how many ""good"" films are the DCU going to have until we have a ""amazing"" dcu film. maybe its just zack snyder but i like mos and bvs , buy they both could be sooo much better. when will we get a dcu film as good as guardians of the galaxy or the winter soldier
 no im not a marvel fanboy. im a comic book fanboy"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm only watching this for Harley Quinn. The rest can suck it.
CmRih_VtVAs,+1 the people how prefer marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,worst joker ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"In parts of the trailer Harley is wearing a ""Puddin"" necklace around her neck and in other parts she's not. Maybe means something? Like maybe her leaving Joker and coming back to him later on in the movie??"
CmRih_VtVAs,new footage today btw
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad, please don't disappoint!"
CmRih_VtVAs,'I cant wait to show you my toys' Fuckin' Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,"i DO hope that the movie is actually good……
BvS kinda letdown for me… :("
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else notice Dean Ambrose at 38 seconds?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody... aahhhhhhh UvU
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else sing along for some weird reason i'm not gonna tell anyone therefore it's not important please ignore this comment.
CmRih_VtVAs,Even if this movie does happen to be a flop--at least the trailer was fucking amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this is as good as Deadpool.... It looks like it will be
CmRih_VtVAs,Crazy)
CmRih_VtVAs,Best edited trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the villain of this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,who are the characters in this movie??? can you name them??? plssss
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait till this comes to netflix
CmRih_VtVAs,"fed up of people with a bad accent saving the world by promoting weapons. Oh, I am not talking about the trailer btw."
CmRih_VtVAs,"There bad guys who are paid to save the world Sort of like that. 

FIB using them for weapons or something"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who finds the joker really really hot
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really hope that Harleys dialogue is better then what we see here. So far, it could have been written by an edgy 15-year old girl."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The guy opening the soda or beer...so me...""Well shits hitting the fan time to Crack one open."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really liked BvS, but feel like this movie will do way better"
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman V Superman. Check.  Now bring on Suicide squad. Fuck yeah. (BTW I loved BvS. Get at me haters)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Maybe this won't be a ""mehh, it was aight..."""
CmRih_VtVAs,not trying to offend anyone but why is Deadshot African-American? He's Caucasian in the comics tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Worst. Heroes. Ever""
They were never heroes in the first place."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like its gonna be rated r. I mean HOW can they keep THIS pg-13?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate Will Smith for Deadshot tbh, but he'll do  well anyways"
CmRih_VtVAs,if the critics hated BvS for being too dark.....just wait until they see this!!!!!!! I'm not complaining this movie could only work if it's dark
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE YOU HARLY
CmRih_VtVAs,song
CmRih_VtVAs,song
CmRih_VtVAs,what is this movie rated
CmRih_VtVAs,0:18 I don't why that makes me laugh every time I see the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"WTF are modern trailers? Already know the plot, the 'Joker' dies in acid and basically all the main characters."
CmRih_VtVAs,This two and a half minutes trailer looks better than BvS already.
CmRih_VtVAs,queeen
CmRih_VtVAs,gotta see it
CmRih_VtVAs,So exited for this movie!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is this trailer like guardians of the Galaxy?🤔
CmRih_VtVAs,For what age is that movie ??
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith -Oscars 2016- the first black win oscar
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fuck, now I'm gonna have to fap during the movie and miss most of it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"idk why I noticed when Harley broke the glass to grab the purse the shirt next to it said ""Si vis pacem ,para bellum"".."
CmRih_VtVAs,hyped🔫💣
CmRih_VtVAs,"please....Warner, do not put so much comedy in this!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman featuring suicide squad. Can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT DAY I  AUGUST I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE IF I DONT ILL COMIT SUICIDE
CmRih_VtVAs,"Revive Heath Ledger and put him in this film
Is that too much to ask?"
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one that started crying while watching this?
CmRih_VtVAs,I cringed at their use of Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,i am sick of this forced humor
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it bad I noticed branding on the display, 'Si vis Pacem, Parabellum' -If you wish for peace prepare for war?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This one actually looks good. Hopefully it doesn't tank like bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,0:08 Looks like Britta from Community!
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy much?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can I say that this trailer reminds me a lot of the guardians of the galaxy trailer without getting any of the fanboy hate?
CmRih_VtVAs,Just came here after watching batman v superman for the second time....THIS YEAR IS GOING TO BE FUCKING AWESOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is how you trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,who thinks that joker is so awesome but insane
CmRih_VtVAs,Brainiac is in this film during the subway part!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I'm Harley..
CmRih_VtVAs,Who here is from glam and gore??
CmRih_VtVAs,LEX LUTHOR WHERE ARE YOU
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else besides me saw this trailer when going to see batman v superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,what's is the name of the soundtrack really nice to heaerw
CmRih_VtVAs,WHY DO THEY MAKE US WAIT SO LONG!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is the Joker ugly?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jokers grills just annoy me so fucking much
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than avengers
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well atleast this will be a good recovery film for warners and dc. Snyder's batman was fucking shit, lucky for them this looks exceptional."
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even know how many times I've watch this😂
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like complete junk
CmRih_VtVAs,This gave my heart a boner
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am really hoping this one is not just good but great, since i was disappointed by BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,_What's the music for this trailer?_ _I love it._
CmRih_VtVAs,BVS (Ahem.New Batman) taught me not to judge the new Joker first before I've seen the movie. 
CmRih_VtVAs,IF BvS is any indicator then this movie is going to bomb hard.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like hamill's Joker better
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody was just perfect for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,first of all.. perfect song choice!!! second when is this in theaters!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,And all the sudden everyone wants to see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ihate the part where that guy opens the stupid soda can and ruin the music 
Like wtf ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is Hot!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else feel this flick would definitely be more entertaining as a dark deadpan humored rated R film?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I ain't satisfied until Will Smith decides to do a rap song for the movie, who's with me?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks like at least this movie will have some comic relief (thanks to The Joker & Harley Quinn)....'We are the bad guys, this is what we do'...hehehe!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm hopeful that I'm going to see it, I'd be really sad if I cant"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley looks bomb AF 😍😍 and I made a fan video with her in it and you can check it out if you want,I'm not really a advertiser type of girl,but hey!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Pause at 2:07 for some Harley butt.
CmRih_VtVAs,Viola davis 😅🙌🏼
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley:WOOOOOAAAAAHHHHHH 
Me:yes this is going to be great"
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this film is able to save the DC Cinematic Universe, it's going to be pretty sad if the Suicide Squad portrayed here is a 1000x more likeable and heroic than this universe's version of Batman and Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Michael Rowe should be Deadshot. He played him perfectly in Arrow, and while Will Smith is a great actor, the casting is way off. Smith lacks the intense/psychotic look that Deadshot carries. its really a shame."
CmRih_VtVAs,barely any love for Deathstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,take my money i wanna see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else turns up when 1:32 starts.
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song?? Plz tell me
CmRih_VtVAs,go Leto! GOOOOO! That your best!
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP DC
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is just perfect for this...coolest way to mix it into a trailer...gun sounds :>
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't even remember the last time I saw a movie trailer this good. I mean, come on, the first Warcraft trailer featuring the ""300:Rise of an empire"" edit of Black Sabbath - War Pigs on the backround is pure awesome and just too epic, but the concept,montage, music and video cuts in this trailer are a work of cinematographic art, not to mention advertising and promoting mastery. Whoever created this trailer should win at least a giant gold medal, if not a big financial bonus. If the movie is at least half as good as the trailer, Suicide Squad could be ""One For The Books"" in the history of comics book movies, if not movies in general. Awesome trailer, just awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,<3 Queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RAPSODY
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how they made captain boomerang look cooler than his comic counterpart.
CmRih_VtVAs,will smit look realy bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,harley is my bae
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm scared of all clowns except the joker ._.
CmRih_VtVAs,Didnt wanna see it at first but the trailer blended so well with the song THATS what sold me. Also the joker and the crazy girl didnt hurt either 😜
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite part is when will smith was getting ready to fight
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think, SS will be the best movie of DCEU ever... I hope better than TDK"
CmRih_VtVAs,So this is pretty much universilally liked
CmRih_VtVAs,Kinda sucks that the bad guys are made into Heros. Really wanted a movie about villains being.. Well. Villains
CmRih_VtVAs,I dont like that joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"""i think we'll go with a little bohemian rhapsody gentlemen"""
CmRih_VtVAs,@1:15 deadshots enhanced vision thing is on the wrong fucking eye
CmRih_VtVAs,"Right you fuckers, someone cam this in HD not a fucken patatoe! inside a drum!  while being fucked by a carrot! !!! got that!  have a nice day :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who likes the new joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,Imagine if Deadpool was there. DOPE!
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto sucks ass
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE THE WAY HARLEY IS
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm just here cuz Queen is queen
CmRih_VtVAs,esta peli va a estar buenaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,"And of course, will smith needed like 5 different speaking lines in the freakin trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,you know what i hate about this trailer you give so much important information about the movie in the trailer its obvious that Harley Quinn dies in some form of acid and the joker joker jumps in after her do not give so much away when you do trailers it could very much ruin the surprise and suspense or prob already ruined it i will still watch but that was a fail on the makers of this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks Boss
CmRih_VtVAs,A movie about super villains who become a team and fight crime. Now that's the way I like it!
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Suicide Squad fails, DC's next film will be Suicide Hotline"
CmRih_VtVAs,is there any relation  with batman or any other dc hero's. .? with this movie. . ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Shit I had goosebumps when I watched the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Doesnt look great, but at least looks good enough to want to see at least once."
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the second song that starts at 1:38 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody and this trailer are so perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Suck it MARVEL!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, half of those views have got to be mine."
CmRih_VtVAs,What a triller omg!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"What I do enjoy is how the film takes apart the difference between being bad and being evil.

They're bad, but they're definitely not evil."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Jai Courtney in this?
CmRih_VtVAs,Please be rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh baby!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Freeze me and wake me up in August
CmRih_VtVAs,That soundtrack mixing tho
CmRih_VtVAs,I come to here to see if suicide squad can lift up my mood after to see BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,"why do I read ""worst heroes ever"" in comic book guy voice. :p"
CmRih_VtVAs,might be cool....but will smith?  naahhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,i love the color theme
CmRih_VtVAs,im actually less excited about this movie now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Feels amazing when thinking that the batman in bvs have saw all these guys
CmRih_VtVAs,WHOOP DEAD POOL IS COMING LOL XP
CmRih_VtVAs,killer crock: he eats people.... lol xD
CmRih_VtVAs,please be good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Don't get overhyped for this like we did with batman v superman. That movie was so boring, I fell asleep for 35 minutes of it and when I woke up I asked my friends what I missed and they said nothing lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope this movie doesn't suck
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx isdatchou?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 Not all bad guys steal things Harley . Some just kill people
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so fucking hot!
CmRih_VtVAs,"O my god now in every bohemian rhapsody video im probably gonna see ""the sucide squad trailer brought me here"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nunca había visto una haley qinn tan pinche plana, joder, tengo mas nalgas yo."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,anthony jeselnik should write for the suicide squad movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my unicorn
CmRih_VtVAs,My fav part was Bohemian rhapsody jk probably the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,that drinking dude at 1:35
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the kind of tone we need for DC. Ever since the Nolan trilogy, DC's cinematic showings have been in a spiral loop of grim and gritty. Even where grim and gritty needs to be as far away as possible for certain characters (Man of Steel/BvS). Not to say that this tone needs to be in every film DC puts out. Tone needs to change depending on the character. This one is different from the Nolan trilogy and fits with characters on screen. Kinda reminds me of GotG a bit which is a good thing. Please keep this up DC. Maybe I'll get a decent Superman movie before I die."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Don't worry guys, it's gonna be FUN(!)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"why does will Smith think he ""deigns"" to play deadshot? He looks AWESOME in this role!"
CmRih_VtVAs,A movie about crazy killer villains looks funner than a movie with Batman and Superman.  Who'd have thought?
CmRih_VtVAs,wasted opturtinte could have potetionel
CmRih_VtVAs,this better be good
CmRih_VtVAs,"A wise man once said ""show me your soundtrack and I will show you the movie's future!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 best scene in the whole movie.. i bet^^
CmRih_VtVAs,I just want to find out what the panda is doing with an AK.
CmRih_VtVAs,Proof that hollywood can ruin even the lesser known super hero comics
CmRih_VtVAs,Was Batman Vs. Superman that bad guys? :o
CmRih_VtVAs,so glad they're refilming to make it more funny
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, this film is about a bunch of criminals with no redemptive qualities (that only comic book fans will know) who come together to form a team (like Guardians of the Galaxy), is set before the events of MoS and BvS (which will confuse the general audience), has a similarly dark tone like BvS (which is a reason for it underperforming), is directed by a guy who has only done about a half dozen comedy/action films (genres that don't lean too heavily on character and plot development), is relying on being successful off the back of BvS (which isn't doing too great itself), and is trying to convince us it's going to be good because it uses a Queen song in the trailer and shows funny Harley moments which will probably be the only moments of levity in the whole film?

Does that sound about right?

P.S. Some cheap writing in there too; ""We're bad guys. It's what we do."" *cringe*"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have total faith in this movie since it's being directed by David Ayer who makes actual good movies and cares about character development rather than HACK SYNEDER>
CmRih_VtVAs,eu adoro filmes assim
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody 💓
CmRih_VtVAs,Can this have an R rating please ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Trying to make the trailer awesome by putting a epic rock song in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope the villain in this movie is Brimstone.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley and boomerang and the joker are the best characters ever
CmRih_VtVAs,just going to be better than bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,"02:07 , best part!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats the song called

CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone's parents have the same name in this movie ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this just fantasy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"damm,, what is the song? its reaaly beautyfull"
CmRih_VtVAs,is it Emma Watson at 1 53?
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker would most likely die jumping into the chemical pool from that height. even if he med it into the rather small target the sudden deceleration would cause Joker to die of internal bleeding.. 

But, screw it, I'm gonna watch it five times anyway."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is like a drug.

i need help..."
CmRih_VtVAs,is that jason todd who is being tortured by joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,i want to fucking watch it!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is hands down one of the best movie trailers I have seen!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara looks so different LOL
CmRih_VtVAs,Well at least we know David Ayer can tell a story. Don't worry about the reshoots. Reshoots normally happen in post production.
CmRih_VtVAs,the girls on her are  so fin
CmRih_VtVAs,Coolest. trailer. for. any. movie. ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,don't get this
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that the joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well DC, looks like you've finally figured out one of the reasons Marvel is so popular, a sense of humor."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is no one going to talk about how they made deadshot fucking black!!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that is loving jared Leto as joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks like dc`s gurdians of the galaxy, (not an insult) cause dc have so many intressting characters, and seeing their fun,dark and deep side. can`t wait. (fully aware this will be darker but still i get kinda the same feeling as when i watched the trailer for guardians."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that really joker???
CmRih_VtVAs,WE NEED DEATHSTROKE!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow, its going to be great movie, im going to watch it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"So you think you can love and leave me to die. If el diablo dies in that building, I'm going to be real sad."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was lit in the cinemas😂
CmRih_VtVAs,idk why but flame-dude is adorable and I feel bad for him
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who else heard the news that after bad Batman V Superman reviews they're reshooting to add humor to Suicide Squad. 

I had high hopes, but now I'm a little worried...."
CmRih_VtVAs,"the song is awesome but Harley is supposed to be really stupid and deadshot is narcisistic, also was that thing supposed to be joker?"
CmRih_VtVAs,alguem sabe os nomes das músicas do trailer ??
CmRih_VtVAs,i swear. movies are now using songs from queen in trailers. like the one from hardcore henry like. what other movies use quenn like wtf?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 fucking that robbie's pussy
CmRih_VtVAs,Ya DC good luck reshooting all of it
CmRih_VtVAs,The reshoots are going to fuck it all up!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who wants Harley Quinn to call batman B-man in this movie? (if he is mentioned!)
CmRih_VtVAs,no spiderman?
CmRih_VtVAs,The moment when you realize all the jokes within the film were just in one trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's really hurtful when Joker dies
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw this trailer when I was watching batman vs superman and I AM DEFINITELY GOING BACK TO WATCH THIS. ITS EVEN BETTER IF ITS IN 3D. I really love the girls!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant believe the fact that Boheimen Rhapsody works verry well in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Çalan şarkının ismi ne ?   What is name song ??
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is a babe
CmRih_VtVAs,lol Harley at the end tho
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer looks cool. Harley's hot even if she's a criminal
CmRih_VtVAs,1.44 who ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sneaky poops taking out Freddie's ""Bismillah!"" before ""We will not let you go!"" for reasons that are obvious but should not be -.-"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why did joker shaved his eyebrows ? *derp*
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this movie :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a spoiler 




ben afleck Is in the movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,I know this movie is going to good just for one reason. No Zack Snyder
CmRih_VtVAs,I actually think jai Courtney would be alright in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,your going somewhere very bad
CmRih_VtVAs,Leadger(R.I.P) is the real joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Most unconvincing Harley ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is just perfect. Great to see her in a role like this.
CmRih_VtVAs,FYI Harley Quinn has nudes from wolf of Wall Street 😉
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so different from the other one. It's really weird. The other one was like some out of place emotional stuff and this one is just fun and action.
CmRih_VtVAs,*Cacete...vou ter que esperar até Agosto pra assistir esse filmaço!*
CmRih_VtVAs,"I fucking hate the typography, it's so fucking teenager"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen made this trailer 80000x better
CmRih_VtVAs,Wish all theese batman movies kept the sane charecter and conected and made more sence. They never keep the same characters.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nothing really matters to me... Except this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,sometimes the trailer can be better than the movie.. I hope this movie does not let us down.
CmRih_VtVAs,"We Only Have 122 Days, 2 Hours, 22 Minutes, and 34 Seconds!"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC rocks
CmRih_VtVAs,that sip was oddly satisfying
CmRih_VtVAs,it's just you
CmRih_VtVAs,same
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG WHEN SCHOOL IS GOING TO START IS WHEN ITS COMING OUT HOLY SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody knows music name?
CmRih_VtVAs,shut the fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,coming from a marvel fan..harley is fucking amazing. sorry black widow..harley is my quin. 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh God this movie is gonna suck so bad
CmRih_VtVAs,needs more Ben Affleck
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemien rhapsody + This Trailer = AMAZINGNESS
CmRih_VtVAs,People might not like jared leto as the joker but im relly excited to see what he can do.
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Harley beats the shit out of the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,is that the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait to masturbate to this in my local cinema, its going to be a blast."
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasnt really excited for this movie because of DCs streak with bad movies and because I didnt like the trailer at Comic Con but after seeing this im soooooo hyped!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know who dies in this movie.



The marvel universe"
CmRih_VtVAs,Enough with using pop songs for movie trailers. It only makes me hate Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who thinks jared leto and zac effron look very familiar
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the Batman in the movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,I live for Harley 😍😚
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm actually impressed there is a trailer that doesn't give away too much and doesn't have any fade to blacks!

Plus a killer tune! Count me in."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody...
CmRih_VtVAs,Really DC? U are copying Guardians of the Galaxy...?
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song that starts at 1:45 ? something like so u can think ...
CmRih_VtVAs,The great thing happened to this trailer is bohemian rhapsody <3
CmRih_VtVAs,My friend thinks Harley Quinn is awesome. She's 12 and yeah... it's cool though.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can see Ben Affleck in this but Henry CAvill not so much. Haha just think about how mopey supes would act and harley would just torment him about it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the Bohemian Rhapsody background...
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever made this trailer deserves an oscar
CmRih_VtVAs,best part joker laughing with them knifes :0
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck I am so hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone think it could be Floronic Man in the subway? Could lead to an epic Poison Ivy introduction.
CmRih_VtVAs,where is deathstroke???
CmRih_VtVAs,some scene in toronto
CmRih_VtVAs,So excited for this movie! Been watching this trailer like ten times lol I love bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG... Is that cara?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm only watching the movie cause of Queen, I'm sold"
CmRih_VtVAs,they better put bohemian rhapsody in the actual movie
CmRih_VtVAs,It was a really poor choice of song for the ad. I'm no less excited for it though.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07
You're welcome"
CmRih_VtVAs,"hahahaha 2:11 Harley's shirt "" Daddy's lil monster "" LMAOOO"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley mmmm
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn Harley is so hot, shortest short shorts ever!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 2:07. oh my!
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't stop me now from queen would have suit this trailer better
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything sucks.....
CmRih_VtVAs,Gay
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn it's been a while since a trailer got me this excited for a movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how much of this trailer is in the movie now that Warner brothers is reshooting the damn thing.
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched this a lot now please help me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone know what the name of the actress playing Harley Quinn is? Google is pissing me off... :(
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG this guardians of the galaxy TREND of using OLD music now in yer trailers is ALREADY PLAYED OUT
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so freaking excited
CmRih_VtVAs,I've been searching that Back round song for a long time what is the title?
CmRih_VtVAs,for people who are hating dc's movies they are doing way better with the tv shows like gotham flash etc all marvel really has is agents of sheild
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's sings this song
CmRih_VtVAs,I think these guys will fight the Marvel I like DC better
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the music?
CmRih_VtVAs,IT'S PERFECT !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"who 
I've
in
rock
ford"
CmRih_VtVAs,so margot robbie is jinx
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley acts like a typical ""LOL I'M SO CRAZY"" Tumblrite who is attention seeking as shit instead of how she should be acting (look at examples from Batman, The Animated Series, and the Arkham games)."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Deadshot = Great character

Will Smith = Great actor"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley seems like the edgy emo girl that says ""LUL SO RANDOM"" all the time and will smith needs to not say ""let's go save the world"" it's the worst line in this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate it when they use such amazing songs in the trailer for a movie, since it keeps stopping ;-;"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Adam beach!!!! 

""We're just and Indian...and some suicide squad..."""
CmRih_VtVAs,When they announced they were doing a suicide squad film I ran round my house cheering. When they released this trailer I ran down my street cheering.
CmRih_VtVAs,This comes out on my birthday lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lying, no good, dishonest producers..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"who thinks Jake Gyllenhaal would be a great joker. just make him lose some weight like he did in nightcrawler, dye his hair green and make him do his creepy as smile and boom a great joker, oh add some make-up of course"
CmRih_VtVAs,Film age?
CmRih_VtVAs,I am only REALLY excited for Harley and The Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,The amount of times I've watched this is unreal
CmRih_VtVAs,Thanks
CmRih_VtVAs,I SAW CARA!!!!!????
CmRih_VtVAs,Justin beiber sounds really good singing this song
CmRih_VtVAs,New trailer April 10 MTV movie awards
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope they show the joker for the psychopath he is and not for the collective idea of the funny freak some audiences have built
CmRih_VtVAs,"Omg!
That Harley!
:)"
CmRih_VtVAs,came to the computer....days later..i knew harley quinn is horny..thats when trap trickers knew he should jerk off
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how crazy it is and you believe that it should be like this coz in the words of Harley Quinn: ""We are bad guys its what we do.."" and of course most importantly their brilliant song choice to choose Bohemian Rhapsody.. just perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,Rotten Tomatoes better not f*ck up this time :/
CmRih_VtVAs,NEED TO SEE That FILM BAD
CmRih_VtVAs,looks awful why jared leto. why the fuck jared leto? why cara ? fuck this movie they were going a good direction and they ruined it
CmRih_VtVAs,"To all the ""DC fans"" who joined Marvel fans in sipping that famous brand spanking new tea everyone's raving about while bashing BVS I'll just day this: BVS got all of its budget money back, and WE THE REAL DCEU fans helped the cast and crew get there and now we'll make it to August, BIOTCHES! #DontfuckwithDCnation."
CmRih_VtVAs,C madre
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not till August! NOOOOOO!!!!!! (Dies in a hole). My love, all my favorites, the perfection of this universe. NOT TILL FRIGIN AUGUST!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thats cool and all, but batman would shit on all of them at once...."
CmRih_VtVAs,marvel fukker
CmRih_VtVAs,es lo mas esta pelicula
CmRih_VtVAs,why can't I stop watching this amazing trailer 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope that all DC cinematic universe films are 12 and not 12A because DC could do a lot more interesting batman stories with a 12 like death in the family what might actually be a 15
CmRih_VtVAs,So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye...
CmRih_VtVAs,Another helboy crossed with avengers ripp off movie no one asked for. Serious sugar coated shit cakes are coming out of Hollywood's dirt arsehole.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody makes this trailer awesomly evil and elegant.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't respect will smith anymore since his playing this character
CmRih_VtVAs,They made a really good trailer though..  I think this is a cool movie!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Unlike Batman V Superman (which I ended up liking) I'm really optimistic about this one. Thankfully, Goyer isn't involved with the writing. Most of the issues I had with Man of Steel and Batman V. Superman can mostly be attributed to David Goyer."
CmRih_VtVAs,April 10th. New Trailer. Get Festive
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's just so fucking gorgeous, I can't believe these are the times we're living in."
CmRih_VtVAs,If only this film came out before Batman vs Superman. We would know more of Batman's story and maybe BvS would be better. But no...
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't really count the times I have watched this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG 43 millions views
CmRih_VtVAs,BvS sucked so I'd imagine this going to be just as bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm bothered by Harley wearing only underwear and a crop top while everyone else is in full body gear. What the fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,the only reason there doing this is so they can try to get to deadpools level it. even tho it has killer croc dead shot and a bunch of other cool guys they will never get to the Canadian hero's awesome dick smashing level
CmRih_VtVAs,yup. I'm seeing that the DAY it comes out.
CmRih_VtVAs,Totally awesome! cant wait to take my totally awesome girls
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song at   1:46?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the guy with the sword and who's the person possessed by a witch with flies around her?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Even though I actually sort of liked Batman v Superman, it looks like this movie may be the last hope for the DC Extended Universe. 
If Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman are critical duds, it's all over..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks as cool as Dawn of Justice! And Dawn of Justice is the best movie I've seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,What the hell is this. I  thought there was BATMAN in this. Looks quite boring
CmRih_VtVAs,Rat a Tat would've been a good song for this trailer tbh alsO wHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT CARA
CmRih_VtVAs,the joker and harley remind me of an icecream truck for some reason...
CmRih_VtVAs,where is deathstroke in this like what the heck
CmRih_VtVAs,i think this might be one of my favourite DC movies
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow now im not sure which even gonna be better,
DC badguys trying to save the world or
marvel heroes beating up each other to the ground.."
CmRih_VtVAs,im too excited for this movie like omg i seriously cant wait and i loooooooovvvveee Harley Quinn and i have a feeling shes gonna be awesome in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 1:58 the color red and purple forms a heart
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys
CmRih_VtVAs,"Probably going to be the best DC film ever. Over the past years it has been quite a poor display of DC movies, hopefully this'll be a game changer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it more or the boomerang guy is Tom Hardy???
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Drown the kids and shoot the neighbors! We've got a winner!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,this film would be infinitely better with an r rating
CmRih_VtVAs,watching this cause of Cara ~
CmRih_VtVAs,As a fan of the suicide squad since 2004 I have never been so excited for a movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Better save my money to buy this on iTunes
CmRih_VtVAs,is that kira from teen wolf? lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Black Manta God Dammit!
CmRih_VtVAs,Sweet
CmRih_VtVAs,"Male Crush: Joker
Female Crush: Harley
Both are amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi has Batman suicide squad been out arereddy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish Heath leadger was still alive so he could do the joker on suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 really
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, lets be honest here. As awesome as this trailer is, the fact that they have Bohemian Rhapsody makes it 10 times better can we agree on that?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just noticed that Harley Quinn has a small heart tattooed on her cheek. Possible Marina and the Diamonds reference?
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope this will turn out good unlike BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so pumped!
CmRih_VtVAs,It's all fun and games until reshoots are needed to make the film fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,In skwad we trust 🙌🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is playing
CmRih_VtVAs,Why you destroyed this beautiful song :(
CmRih_VtVAs,I think it's been 2 years that I waited for the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai's eyebrow raise at 1:28... <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker will ACTUALLY have a fear of being killed by Batman. this film will be interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT TO SHOW YOU MINE TOYS!
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is gonna suck like hell and yet I cannot wait to see it... Thanks bohemian rhapsody!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one of the best trailers I ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,Everytime i realize the wait time for this masterpiece........ 1:53
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man of steel- suck
Batman vs superman-suck
suicide squad-please warner bros. make one good movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh god this movie better be good we've taken too many Ls already
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is about to be badass!
CmRih_VtVAs,The guys who made this trailer are really talented!
CmRih_VtVAs,This had better make up for the BvS train wreck....
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg the Harley Quinn looks so....her
CmRih_VtVAs,snapchat brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,this is going to be the best movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't wait!;
CmRih_VtVAs,This Joker.. #imisswhysoserious
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn. That's all.
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,would this movie be good for casual dc movie fans?
CmRih_VtVAs,Watching this trailer for the 100th time.
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO READY! I FEEL MY LIFE...i mean heart... SMILING
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Quick question:

How's joker related to the suicide squad movie? And why isn't he in the Suicide Squad?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope we get a foreshadow of Batman/Joker rivalry on this new universe now that we know Batfleck has a small cameo in Suicide Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,"At 1:16, did I see Harley holding a Rhino 60DS ?Cuz if I did, I'm spending way too much time on Youtube"
CmRih_VtVAs,I am going to be disappointed if the Queen song won't be a part of the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,WHATS THE SONG NAME
CmRih_VtVAs,this is a movie ive been stalking for a year now and the trailer is out . the trailer is way better then i expected.
CmRih_VtVAs,hope this is better than batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate the way they cut the song and turn the volume up and down. See what The Big Short has done with When The Levee Breaks.
CmRih_VtVAs,who's here because of bohemian rhapsody?
CmRih_VtVAs,IM WANT TO BE HARLEY
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm the only one who is in love with harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,what type of music is from 1:09
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai courtney will be a good captain boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait till the moment one of them gets killed off and no one bats an eyelash
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope this isn't an R.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think it's will be great than Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY CRAP IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE! HARLEY QUINN IS BÆ
CmRih_VtVAs,Who thinks joker will abuse Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman will hit the billion for WB lol maybe the Harry Potter spinoff. That would be hilarious if BvS won't hit it
CmRih_VtVAs,Wouldn't be better if DEADPOOL was in this squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wonder if Stephen Amell makes a cameo...?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm pissed! Why does this trailer not even have 1M likes?!?!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Roman reigns sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody made this whole trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,I just love this
CmRih_VtVAs,they should have put dont stop me now as the sond in my perfesional opinion :)
CmRih_VtVAs,lmao you guys realize they put every joke they had in the movie into this trailer??
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I just fucking love this trailer!!! I'm using this in my movie themed birthday party... :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this a super hero movie or horror movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will be great then BVS ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg I love bohemian rhapsody by queen
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this going to be the funny face of DC?
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer around
CmRih_VtVAs,let's hope the joker doesn't pull a lex luthor
CmRih_VtVAs,God I love this movie 
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just heard that they're doing re-shoots to make the movie more light - hearted... They better fucking release an original un-cut version without the jokes. They're murderers, not superheroes for fucks sake."
CmRih_VtVAs,So warner bros did do changes to this movie! So disappointed!! If you watch the first trailer that ever came out you'll the difference!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one whos seeing this movie because of Harley Quinn 😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 2:07, you're welcome"
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's her accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone know who the bad guys are in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so pumped for this omg
CmRih_VtVAs,i nned to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is so much better than the first one, hopefully the movie is more like this, dark/comedic tone is a perfect fit for these characters and this movie. Love Harley Quinn!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So batman killed joker because he killed Jason Todd, they're just flashbacks of joker, why do you think batman killed people in the new film"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really don't care about this whole Marvel vs DC useless feud bs. I'm just glad the characters I grew up with are all on the big screen in live action n' sht. I'mma watch it all and tell my future grandkids of how DC and Marvel rocked the Cinemas in the 00's and onward.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else think this movie reminds you of Jinx?
CmRih_VtVAs,in David Ayer we trust
CmRih_VtVAs,"Think i just fell in love with Harley Quinn, any competition here ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet 63% percent of the ppl watching this went to watch Bohemian Rapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,who else paused directly at 2:08?
CmRih_VtVAs,"How do you make a trailer good?
Use the best song ever created.
Queen, oh how i love you <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the age rating for suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Good lord this movie looks terrible.....and im not being sarcastic.
CmRih_VtVAs,The facts that cara in it 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,joel kinnaman looks so different here hehe
CmRih_VtVAs,"There's rumours that WB wants to do reshoots to make the film more 'humourous' and 'light-hearted'. Remember the last time a comic-book movie had reshoots? That's right, Fant4stic. Do you remember how good that was? No, you don't. Because it was a  big steaming pile of shit pumped out of the anus of a studio. I'm worried that if these rumours are true, and the movie turns out to be shit, I will throw my popcorn at the screen the night I see it and just give up on DC movies, because if that what comes out, we will all know they're playing catchup with Marvel. Let's all hope for the best for this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,@Warner Bros. Pictures  Please don't do any reshoots for SS. Keep SS dark as it supposed to be. Make movies for us comic fans. Not critics who never read a comic in their life. Can't wait to see Suicide Squad. :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,go away evil dogger
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's body fits Joker's slender shape! I hope he rocks it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"DONT CHANGE THE ""DARK HUMOR."" I bet marvel's behind the petition, smfh. Keep up the GREAT work DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Look at the writing on t-shirt on 2:07 :D si vis pacem para bellum! In latin this means ""If you want peac,e prepare for war"" :D perfect reference ihmo :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer looks awesome, but the fact that they are doing major reshoots 4 months before its release and that is not because they missed a shot or footage was lost its because they need to make it more fun. This movie already looks like a lot of fun I am kind of worried now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey if you saw the movie and thought it was bad, chill, IT WAS JUST A JOKE, DC PLAYED US APRILS FOOLS DAY JOKE, now lets sit back and wait for Suicide Squad :3"
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard Leto almost went crazy playing Joker. I heard he sent a vid to the whole cast in character talking next to dead bodies of pigs.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So apparently they're putting tens of millions into reshooting scenes so the movie can be more like this trailer, because the trailer is basically just a work of genius editing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath ledger will always be a better joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody is the best possible song they could've found for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared leto will be the successor of the late great Heath ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,omg soo weird
CmRih_VtVAs,Porque siento que el Guasón será una especie de gran Flashback durante toda la película
CmRih_VtVAs,"This .. JUST LOOKS FUN! probably will be amazing though, giving off a great vibe"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks fucking awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,If reshoots are happening to fit this trailer whats everyones opinion on that?
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone give whoever edited this trailer an award; Bohemian Rhapsody fits so well.
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST?!?!?!?! So i have to wait a YEAR FOR IT?!?!?! So much buuulll!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This shit comes out on my birthday! Hype!
CmRih_VtVAs,"PLEASE, DONT FUCK IT"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 2:08 







how many erections can we get?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So apparently Warner Brothers studios are reshooting some scenes for this movie. Turns out, the jokes and comical scenes for the movie are all in this trailer, which means this very well meant that this was gonna be a darker themed movie, AS IT SHOULD. They're reshooting because of a positive response audiences gave when watching this trailer. WB is now spending millions of dollars to re-film scenes just to add more jokes and humor. Personally, i don't think they should do that. These are diabolical DC villains who kill for fun. Why would they make them a little more light hearted. THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO DO GOOD. They're not choosing to do good. I just hope they don't go overboard with the humor like Marvel. Thats one of the reasons why i like DC more than Marvel. It was more serious and a darker tone. Leave the cheesy jokes for Marvel."
CmRih_VtVAs,WB ruined batman vs superman but hopefully they didnt ruin this movie too
CmRih_VtVAs,I fucking swear if this movie is turns out to be as bad as batman vs superman all hope is lost for DC movies
CmRih_VtVAs,wats the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,wny they gotta go and change this shit smh
CmRih_VtVAs,THE HYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,yes my birthday is on August 3
CmRih_VtVAs,I HOPE WE'LL SEE MORE OF GRANNY'S PEACH TEA IN THIS FINE FEATURE.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is going to be the best movie of the year... mark my words!







 I know Deadpool was great, i love that movie but this one is going to be better."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Saw this trailer on the Imax screen at Leicester square befor BvS & 
people were cheering & clapping by the end. I really hope the film 
is as enjoyable as this trailer & not underwhelm me like BvS did"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow... This is one of the best movie trailers ever made...
CmRih_VtVAs,It's not even a good trailer it's just a good song
CmRih_VtVAs,When I watched batman v superman this came on before. it was better than the whole film.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I went to the cinema for watch dirty grandpha and the trailer with the bohemian raphsody was so aaaaa and i'm so exited for all this movie, will and cara is just... perfect"
CmRih_VtVAs,AAAAA
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so, so sorry, DC fans. This is going to suck."

CmRih_VtVAs,Oh God I can see all the Harley Quinn merchandise being sold at Hot Topic
CmRih_VtVAs,So after Conway loses to Underwood he joins Suicide Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"everytime i watch this, there is one particular part in this trailer that is just...i cant explain it.  1:56

The notes of the ""OhHHHWHOAHH"" while the Joker is swan diving into the vat of acid. Then the ""BABBYYYY"" as he's lifting Harley out. Its honestly beautifully put together.  It gives me chills.  IMO, its the most beautiful seconds of this trailer.  So subtle yet so powerful.  Love it.  Freddy Mercury would be so proud =)"
CmRih_VtVAs,i Really want this to be great.  but thats the joker i mean really?  *shakes head*  my favorite villain ruined!  But at least harly looked good.  Please save this for me Boo!
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone judging Leto & haven't even seen the damn movie. Watch him prove everyone wrong. I'm confident in his performance.
CmRih_VtVAs,Let the marvel fanboys rain in....
CmRih_VtVAs,"When I hype a movie, I speak gibberish um.. Mudbora borada barso wohahi tantiya wakene! August, people!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, Joker was Robin. See ya."
CmRih_VtVAs,Only here for Jai Courtney
CmRih_VtVAs,dude ive never been so exicited for a movie xD harley thoooo v.v 💕 & ..... this is going to be PG13 i think right?
CmRih_VtVAs,Eargasm...
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this is how you do a trailer.  Best Trailer of 2016 so far.  Can't wait for this movie!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's king shark?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide squad the real superhero film.
Just saying"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Omg! Harley is so cute ican,t  wait for this movie!😁"
CmRih_VtVAs,so beautiful omg
CmRih_VtVAs,Why did the Joker save Harley Quinn out of the chemicals? Didn't they often try to kill each other? I'm so confused if they're in love or not
CmRih_VtVAs,If you my friend play the worlds greatest song in your trailer then we can't help but say it's gonna be hell of a movie . Please prove us right.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,What's gonna be better force awakens or this
CmRih_VtVAs,"I literally come view the trailer, over & over again. My fascination grows, i pretend to be every character in each scene, my most favorite Harley Quinn. I think of myself in my hairy, body & thick meaty thighs, wearing tiny booty shorts & colored pigtails & saying, ""relax were bad guys, it's what we do"", as I slowly make my way down to your toes to suck & say, that I'm I'm super excited for this film!"
CmRih_VtVAs,i have never wanted a movie to come out so badly
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my TOYS"" Lmfao"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the fact they used this song in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"My house trailer was much better than this. I camped someplease in southern texas, and smoked some crack. I just finished some work on my farm, and now I'm on vacation. This trailer gave me cancer, please donate one hundred rubies for my recovery. Much appreciated, love from Iride."
CmRih_VtVAs,Saw this trailer. Thought it is ok. Saw it in theater before movie - blew my mind. Wide screen action punching to Bohemian Rhapsody is probably coolest thing I experienced in my life.
CmRih_VtVAs,omgaa i wanna see this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Deadpool, I think you're about to meet your match."
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the greatest trailers of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Plus, Jared Leto is the HOTTEST VILLIAN I ever saw in my ENTIRE LIFE!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I do not understand how this video has 11k dislikes... I mean first of all, great casting choices, Margot Robbie is looking good in that Harley Quinn costume... I don't UNDERSTAND!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who lets a stupidly crazy smile come to their face when I hear Harley Quinn let out ""Whoa!"" at 1:09 ? Just as an example."
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't stop watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer I ever watched hands down
CmRih_VtVAs,"2016:
The year all the heroes are fighting each other over the stupidest shit imaginable......
..and villains gather to have a hell of a time.

FUCK! I have never been so excited for a superhero movie before in my life, and its main characters are villains! 

I am hyped for this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I watch this trailer everyday 5x a day. This trailer gives me life, the only reason for me to live. When I first saw the trailer I got a seizure out of excitement. I have a calendar just to count down the days for Suicide Squad. When I go to the premier of the movie I will probably have a hart attack at the opening credits. I will watch this movie everyday till it is out of theaters. And wait for the DVD to come out. Then I will wait for Lego Batman."
CmRih_VtVAs,suicide squad a last hope
CmRih_VtVAs,is that poison ivy in the subway?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jesus Christ I'm so fuckin pumped man
CmRih_VtVAs,"David Ayer, you are our last hope for a DCEU. #suicidesquad #firesnyder"
CmRih_VtVAs,"is this done trailer the reason why everyone watches that queen video?

If so...

*packs clothes*
Fuck this shit im out..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, Queen just makes anything so good!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only guy that is more hyped for Deadshot than Harley Queen horny stuff?
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07, fellas. 2:07"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie needs to be rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to see it and by sarahs girl named jordan
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm scared
CmRih_VtVAs,"Don't know about the rest of y'all, but I'm looking forward to seeing El Diablo the most."
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this doesn't flop like Batman Vs. Superman...
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome I just read that Ben affeck is confirmed for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I've watched this too many times XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley looks FANTASTIC in this. Whoever did casting is a wizard or something!
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever did casting for this movie did a fantastic job
CmRih_VtVAs,Seriously how come this trailer gets +43 million views while the last BvS trailer is close to 3.5 million
CmRih_VtVAs,1:16 Best part of the trailer O_O
CmRih_VtVAs,So gonna watch it.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is going to be fun better than BVS which is shame that were rooting for the villains
CmRih_VtVAs,0.18 Tom Hardy is that you?!
CmRih_VtVAs,my new favourite trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that thinks Margot Robbie is going to be the best in this movie? I mean.. Look at how good she portrays Harley Quinn!
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is this
CmRih_VtVAs,severely disappointed on how they seem to be portraying Harley. also her outfit makes no sense. I just hope it's better than what they're showing
CmRih_VtVAs,"And i thought maybe this could be a great movie. oh my dear god, fuck u DC.This is just a fuckin disappointment after the first Teasers & Trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was never a fan of Harley Quinn, she annoyed me, but I love this version of her"
CmRih_VtVAs,what a fucking good song...
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody playing in the background is really just too much to handle
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no doubt this film will be better than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,Бля жду этот фильм
CmRih_VtVAs,How many of them do you think will die?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not hating but Harley's voice is not right
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08-2:10 are the best part of the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,ive never got excited this much to watch a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel has the best heroes, DC has the best villains. So this is going to basically be DC avengers in terms of quality and reception."
CmRih_VtVAs,And here I thought this would be a scary movie.... My mistake.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody have any idea who the enemy in this film might be? Who the suicide squad is going after?
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucked by Batfleck Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how they used Bohemian Rhapsody for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Even though I'm an open and proud gay man I can honestly say when it comes to Harley Quinn I'd totally hit that 😆
CmRih_VtVAs,The best use for Bohemian Rhapsody in a while
CmRih_VtVAs,Were is batman in all these mess?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Heard Batman from BvS is in this film, Are we Gonna see the Badassery and Brutality of him in this film?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"AGAIN I'm REMINDED of The TIMELESS Voice of Freddie Mercury,and Queen.

 So Freddie,again You TRULY Died way before your Time !

But I think you'd be Happy at what Your LEGACY,and VOICE left us !

I think it's Safe to say YOU,and Queen will Live on for a Loooong Time !

( R.I.P. ) My Zoroastrian Brother......"
CmRih_VtVAs,bet you guys came here to see the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this trailer is Misleading and it turns out the film is as dark and humourless as BVS I am going over to DC, punch the heads of the film devision and tell them to LIGHTEN UP!!!!!
also will there be Lego sets of this because that would be awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,This song was made for trailer music. I can feel it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Last time in a movie theater was 1995. I think I will have to see this movie in all it's glory in a movie theater. I hate what theaters have become, but some movies are worth the sacrifice."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hopefully, this movie will be much better than that BvS bullshit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Did I see Emma Watson there?
CmRih_VtVAs,This and Civil War are gonna be the best comic book films of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,"And it looks like a post Metropolis/Superman government clean up waiting to go wrong. You know, after he and Zod wrecked the city. So TSX had to clean up and take the blame. 

""Nothing really matters to me."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:20
Joker:"" I can't wait to show you my toys."" 
Is he talking to Batfleck?"
CmRih_VtVAs,please be better than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,i really hope this movie is funny as fuck and awesome as heck. DC for the win
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love this movie and it hasn't even came out yet. True love.💖😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Who were dem people Joker? Harley Quinn? Lobo (but a girl)?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Even if the movie is bad, this trailer will remain great."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dc for life!
CmRih_VtVAs,Actually looking forward to leto's joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie will be the best Harley Quinn in my opinion. (In live action movies)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol, the enchantress looks like she has major stink fumes floating around her! Kinda reminds me of the character ""Pig Pen"" from Charlie Brown! 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,I im dying to see this and i absolutely love harley queen shes my favorite😎🃏♦. All the characters look so amazing even rick flag lol😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Whos going to search Bohemian Rhapsody on youtube after watching this??. 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like ronin 48
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how the only woman lead in this film (the only badass one involved in the action anyway) is sexualised. Like women can't be awesome without being ""displayed"" like that. Hope she kicks some serious balls."
CmRih_VtVAs,where is batman???
CmRih_VtVAs,Just shut up and take my money already
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks so freaking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Clint  Eastwood Son dick Grayson?
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one who can't wait to see joker's toys???
CmRih_VtVAs,what the hell is wrong with you people ? lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,cuando vea esta película podre morir en paz...
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone else agree that Heath Ledger was the best Joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wonder if Robin is in this movie. Because Robin suit has ""Ha Ha jokes on you"" in BVS( I swear I'm not spoiling the movie, it showed the suit in the trailer.) and since this movie was suppose to be before BVS, Robin probably gets rekt by the joker. If this movie was after BVS we could've saw Robin featuring in the movie. Idk this is my theory. And also Batman is in this movie, so probably he is going to save Robin, if it's not too late."
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,cool Adam Beach is in this movie awesome!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,It is going to be my fav movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or does Leto's joker seem like a mashup of ledger and hamill?
CmRih_VtVAs,August? That's too damn far away ugh
CmRih_VtVAs,What songs??
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this trailer more than 10 times already lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am too excited for this movie, and I really do hope it's as fun and crazy as the trailer portrays it to be. 👍❤"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this movie more I cant' wait to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,This years mad max fury road!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love Harley Quinn in this!  what's that I should kill everyone and escape... sorry, voices... I'm kidding they didn't actually say that!"
CmRih_VtVAs,it's so epic from 1:38 xD Can't wait for it
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this song
CmRih_VtVAs,Definitely one of the best trailers of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, the time for the lucky good heroes is over.
This is first."
CmRih_VtVAs,this is seriously the best trailer in existence.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a make for break for the DC universe with this movie. This movie needs to save BvS movie after the mix reaction.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, time to change my pants"
CmRih_VtVAs,God dammit 😭😭😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great casting, so basicaly in the movie we will see Harley Quinn, Enchantress, Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, Slipknot and WILL SMITH !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Movie Trailer Ever!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,m here just for d JOKER
CmRih_VtVAs,This is great eye-bleach after Batman v Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,I can not wait till it comes out

CmRih_VtVAs,nirvana is such a great band I mean its just incredible
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY OMG YESSSS QUEENNNNN
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain Boomerang will steal the show
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't tell; what book is harley reading at 0:09?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I swear this is the best comic book trailer I have ever seen. Such a well done trailer, how the scenes match up with the song not only in the beat and such, but also the lyrics. If you really look at it, you can see how each line of the song correlates with whats happening on screen. Bravo, DC. Bravo."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer of 2016 in my opinion. Can't wait till August!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is this actually one of the most greatest trailers ever to come out in recent times? (I have no bias for Suicide Squad or Bohemian Rhapsody, just the mere treatment of this trailer makes it great for me)"
CmRih_VtVAs,song??
CmRih_VtVAs,Can this comment get the same number of likes that the year is.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like it when the gunshots match the beat of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,What were all the songs used  in the trailer ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Which city  does suicide squad belong? Gotham?
CmRih_VtVAs,plz tell me the bgms..
CmRih_VtVAs,Came after superman vs batman I hope this movies better
CmRih_VtVAs,11 472 people didn't get a boner watching this.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see Joker's toys
CmRih_VtVAs,against what are they fighting?
CmRih_VtVAs,So edgy...
CmRih_VtVAs,Хотя бы не проебите их
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this trailer for over 20 times... Is that bad?
CmRih_VtVAs,wooow amazing action...exited to watch it..
CmRih_VtVAs,weak
CmRih_VtVAs,"In the words of the wise philosopher king Flo de Ri Dah

WHO DAT GIRL"
CmRih_VtVAs,high hopes for this movie and I really hope this doesn't flop
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley cringe
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope there's an IMAX 2D showing!! Really looking forward to this one. I'm seeing BvS tomorrow in IMAX 2D; hoping its not too bad! (I didn't like Man of Steel that much)
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this is a good joker for this film but i dont want him in the next batman film.
CmRih_VtVAs,where is Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,"who's your favorite character of suicide squad? 
For me 
Enchantress 💀"
CmRih_VtVAs,is joker the villain here?
CmRih_VtVAs,is......was that Ike? from Mad Tv Ike Barinholtz
CmRih_VtVAs,nice trailer...love the part when the guy took a sip of his drink lol.....I think I'm gonna check this out when it's released..
CmRih_VtVAs,That song. Perfection.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully this will be a lot better than Batman v Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jokers laugh makes me happy
CmRih_VtVAs,Commet ur fave villan! me: Harley Quinn over 9000
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song in the beginning?
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this and sang the song the whole time
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is fantastic, i really hope they can deliver, unlike BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else hope there's a ""gear up"" montage in this movie?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well they'd better put this song in the movie bc i have been watching this on repeat since it's bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see it but everybody has to wait till August that sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 groot?
CmRih_VtVAs,oooohhhh Margot Robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,I have this feeling that this film might be way better than Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,wait so joker isn't a member of suicide squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,I really wanna see if Joker and Harley Quinn reunite and how they'll react to each other. I ship them so much.🃏💚❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know about this version of Harley Quinn, I would've prefer the version where she wears the bodysuit as a joker/buffoon, with the hat, maybe that's for when she joins the Joker, just saying, that's the one I'm not very convinced about. By the way, I saw the B v S movie, and I liked it, I thought it was good, I think it was used more as a set up for the coming movies. Affleck's Batman was good, it was the 'old(as in age)' version though, not in his prime version. I think many people are saying they didn't like it just because they don't like Affleck. The only thing I didn't like, was that there was no teaser at the end of credits, that must be a Marvel thing, wouldn't hurt if DC did it too, that's a hook to have you watch the next one. Can't wait to see what they do with Cyborg, Aquaman, and Flash... Wonderchick, grrrrawwwrrr. o.O"
CmRih_VtVAs,I guess I am legend does have a prequel
CmRih_VtVAs,I
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,this film looks to good
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks fucking stupid, no wonder this generation is all fucked up in the head."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it weird that the villains are showing more human emotion than the heroes.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney ? well fuck this movies gonna suck
CmRih_VtVAs,Joel Kinnaman! Nice! I like that guy.
CmRih_VtVAs,will Smith MEH
CmRih_VtVAs,who is the guy with fire???
CmRih_VtVAs,wht is the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,this is SUCH A GOOD TRAILER IMFG
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or anyone else thinks they got the wrong actors for this movie....
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that avengers formula is failing and formula for new sci-fi movie is coming back for eg. see Edge of Tomorrow or Deadpool. This film is going to be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,is this rated r please say no
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman v Superman was mediocre. Hopefully this movie will save the DC universe. Marvel is pwning DC so far.
CmRih_VtVAs,Do they assault the mental hospital in Gotham.
CmRih_VtVAs,how can we concentrate on the movie when Margot Robbie too damn hottttt
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does Joker have a beasty ass grill?
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank God! This movie has a different director
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's ok, Snyder's only producing this one."
CmRih_VtVAs,My anticipation for this is so high.
CmRih_VtVAs,When does this movie come out again?
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie seems more risky now with the reception of dawn of justice which wasn't that bad
CmRih_VtVAs,Rated R pleaaase
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know about you guys but I'm way more excited for this than Dawn of Justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,so. This is DC's answer to Deadpool.
CmRih_VtVAs,Spoiler alert: Dumbledore dies
CmRih_VtVAs,"Пожалуйста, не проебите этот фильм как БпС!"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG !! what the fucken trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,MOTHERFUCKER GIVE US THIS MOVIE NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,I just want this movie to be out June I'm so sad
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's frosty?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 .... That moment when you realize you have to watch this movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this rated
CmRih_VtVAs,nice music
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want this moive so bad, the trailer is awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's ironic how this movie has more representation than all of Marvel's recent productions combined.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a Marvel fan and BvS was garbage. 29% on Rotten Tomatoes, GTFO DC. This looks even worse. Boycott DC until they make real movies like MCU yo!"
CmRih_VtVAs,#makeDcGreatAgain
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody did not go well with the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, anyone who says this doesn't look badass doesn't know shit. This looks amazing!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think cara can have a bad guy role in this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks as bad as BvS, yo. Why can't DC make good movies like Marvel, that's all I want to know."
CmRih_VtVAs,I went to make toast and it burnt donate a like for my toast
CmRih_VtVAs,make standlone batfleck trilogy . suicide sqaud 2 . and dc u r on your track
CmRih_VtVAs,"BEST TRAILER EVER
I WANT TO SEE 2 
AND MOVIE"
CmRih_VtVAs,This will probably be better than Batman V Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT! ! !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I just came here for Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,while everybody is excited for this to drop here i am sitting infront of a computer but totally excited to see harley  portray the role as joker's bitch in this movie. Fuck! i think im in love!
CmRih_VtVAs,nothing beats this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"after BvS,this is what i want.cant wait to see"
CmRih_VtVAs,when is this released. Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nothing really matters, to me!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Release it now
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone watching this trailer right after they saw Batman V Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this not the best song to feature this trailer!? #GOQUEEN!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What songs where used in this trailer and who made them? They sound really good
CmRih_VtVAs,People say that this might be better than B vs S but can't even afford to go watch it...
CmRih_VtVAs,"That was great when Harley bent over for the purse
😘🍑"
CmRih_VtVAs,I REALLY want to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Save us Suicide Squad, you're our only hope."
CmRih_VtVAs,I just came here for Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"first off, Harley Quinn needs to be showing more..  skin. second, Batfleck is starring in this movie. so yeah. He will be putting up with a lot of shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this hot movie and the song playing at 01:04 makes it so much better and entertaining
CmRih_VtVAs,"need. to. see. this. movie.

 #SuicideSquad"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks like a great movie and its the first time the Harley quin has been made to an action real life person
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman v Superman hate... Batman v Superman hate everywhere...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why, but something about Harley's ""Woah!"" just cracks me up every time!"
CmRih_VtVAs,OPEN DA GATES BOIS
CmRih_VtVAs,So is this like DC's version of Guardians of the Galaxy ?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Damn
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M SO EXCITED I COULD CRY
CmRih_VtVAs,What are the name of the song ???
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this movie. I'm so hyped! I just hope the joker is good on this one.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody ftw
CmRih_VtVAs,Dam. I took my finger out of my butt and now it really stinks. Should I just put it back in my butt so I don't smell it anymore?
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank God League of Legends decided to make a movie featuring Jinx.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is watching in 2016?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who has injustice: God's among us?
CmRih_VtVAs,Viola Davis does not deserve to be Amanda Waller. The role go to Cynthia Robbinson. I know that this movie is part od the DC Extended Universe and that Viola Davis received an award for her acting but she is so damn ugly. I am just pissed that Amanda Waller from Arrow got killed.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:03 will smith
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08  You're welcome ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn rules
CmRih_VtVAs,#suicide squad can not wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Dc is just coming out with a boat load of movies more than marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,nones gonna talk about harleys booty at the end of the video? ok...
CmRih_VtVAs,i wish harley still had her accent-
CmRih_VtVAs,Please don't let Joker be a former Robin..........
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley: What's That I should kill everyone and escape.Sorry that's not what they actually said I love that
CmRih_VtVAs,ok ok ok that crazy giy that screams into the camera and he also punches that guard looks just like furious pete!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Even with what happened with BvS, I still have high hopes that suicide squad will be great."
CmRih_VtVAs,Isn't me or that I'm just really horny for Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Will Smith finally going to play a bad guy or are they good?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait.. So this will be PG13... Well f*ck that, I wanna see an absolute psychopath version of Harley Quinn.. You know, setting people on fire, slitting throats, etc.. Same goes for the rest of the bunch."
CmRih_VtVAs,just saw batman  vs superman. Im just here watching this trailer to remind me how good DC really is....
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't stand this trailer. The best thing that happened was the comic-con leak. It made the film look dark,menacing and scary. This just makes it look cheesy. Even though I'm excited for Harley Quinn, I'm not so sure now. The whole ""voices"" dialogue was kind of lame, almost like there trying to hard to let you know she's insane. Oh well hope it's good."
CmRih_VtVAs,let's hope Zach Snyder doesn't direct it
CmRih_VtVAs,"BvS was an okay movie, to treat it fairly I would say average. I just really hope this movie will take the cake though. I love Marvel movies, but I wanna give WB/DC a chance."
CmRih_VtVAs,I am hyped for this movie only because jared leto is the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else is excited to see them kick ass!?!?!? <3 cara delevingne
CmRih_VtVAs,Its too bad that it will be improbable that anyone will ever act the joker better than Heath ledger. That motherfucker was truly insane.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song
CmRih_VtVAs,HU3 FODA CADE OS BR???
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 the residents (eyeball) mask
CmRih_VtVAs,"soo happy its based on New 52. but too bad they didnt put King Shark or Black Spider. i love those two. aside from my lovely Harley, im excited for El Diablo"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was hesitant to even look at the trailers for this movie solely because of Jared Leto.  After hearing the critics for Batman V Superman though and seeing Man of Steel for the first time realizing it wasn't as bad as people made it out to sound, I decided to give this movie a chance and watch the trailer.  And while I still want to be fair and give Batman V Superman a viewing, *this movie **_blows_** the past two away in how much personality and **_fun_** it has to offer in this single trailer alone.*

I'm solely seeing THIS movie in theaters to support THIS direction of DC's movies instead of ""Bleak, super serious, mature,"" and waiting to see Batman V Superman on TV.  Sorry but, even after liking Man of Steel, _I CAN'T ARGUE THAT IT WASN'T DULL/LIFELESS AT MANY POINTS._"
CmRih_VtVAs,"i really like this trailer, a lot.. after seeing bat v sup which i feel like that movie is like putting so many food into my mouth makes me choked (im not saying that its a bad film tho, dnt get me wrong), this suicide squad will be my last shot, will dc give us a fcking badass superhero movies, or just an ""okay"" movies? cus i wanna see dc heroes in a big screen too.. even tho i am marvel fan"
CmRih_VtVAs,"joker looks disappointing as fuck -.-    

RIP Heath Ledger"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can say that although I thought Man of Steel was flawed, it was still a good movie. After seeing Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, I can honestly say it wasn't a good movie. But with Suicide Squad, I feel like this is where the DCU is really going to make it's first GREAT movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Here after the batman vs superman dissapointment. 
hopefully this gives DC some hope!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited...you have no idea
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully this doesn't pull a man of steel and batman v superman where the critics give of a bad score even though it's a good movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be DC's Guardians of The Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one that returns here to see the end of the trailer ? .
CmRih_VtVAs,BEN AFFLECK as BAtman is in this movie??
CmRih_VtVAs,"A Summary of All of the Comments:

1. This is going to be better than Batman v Superman.

2. This isn't going to be nearly as good as Batman v Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 omg dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,I loved Batman v Superman. But i think Suicide Squad will be better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm pretty sure this movie will redeem BVS's sin. And I really hope, they would consider to change Zack Snydick with David Ayer for JLA"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn looks like my aunt, and it's making Very happy."
CmRih_VtVAs,0:17 e o chico bioca ? :v
CmRih_VtVAs,What is it rated? Plz be pg-13
CmRih_VtVAs,"Trailer is just fabulous and looks like Guardians Of The Galaxy meets the Deadpool and Will Smith looks perfect in Character, Maggot Robbie is really crazy enough for it and Jared Leto looks psychotic version of Heath Ledgers Joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith's comeback?
CmRih_VtVAs,what dose that say wil...... will smi.. will smith WILL SMITH
CmRih_VtVAs,she's hot.. you guys know who it is
CmRih_VtVAs,This better be good. One cannot waste the talent of Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,what name song at 30
CmRih_VtVAs,i wrong
CmRih_VtVAs,what name at 30
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a simple man. I see Tom Hardy, Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jared Leto, and Viola Davis, I immediately buy my tickets on Fandango."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this gonna be a PG-13 :o
CmRih_VtVAs,why isn't Enchantress seen with any of them? Is their mission about recruiting her?
CmRih_VtVAs,raj
CmRih_VtVAs,For the love of god make margot robbie make hardcore porn.
CmRih_VtVAs,last chance for DC
CmRih_VtVAs,thats song :D
CmRih_VtVAs,DAT ASS
CmRih_VtVAs,Please be better than Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song title?
CmRih_VtVAs,How cruel to release this in Januray and make us wait till August
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear to god if they mess this up...
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys heheh😈😈😈
CmRih_VtVAs,If DC fucks up this movie its over
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow! Leto has come a long way since getting beat to a bloody pulp in Fight Club he always was one of them johnny depp heath ledger crazy fucking actors that left you scratching your head wondering why they choose the roles they do. So I guess in a weird way he is perfect for the joker cause I think he gots a few screws loose in real life. Good luck jarod.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait for this in 2021
CmRih_VtVAs,"All DC movies will be trash now, Thanks BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the second song??
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite part is the Joker swan diving to get to Harley in the vat of chemicals
CmRih_VtVAs,Finnlay a woman in a movie that actually makes me want to see the movie 😂 bad ass villains yus
CmRih_VtVAs,"man i really dont like how the joker looks
but lovin harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath Ledger set the bar high for Joker. I don't know if I'll actually enjoy this movie. That last scene was so cringy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i think i will actualy go to the movies for this one, instead of wait for it online"
CmRih_VtVAs,The crazy girl kinda looks like Jinx from League of Legends
CmRih_VtVAs,deadshot is probably the least insane person out of this group not including the non prisoners
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best trailers ever
CmRih_VtVAs,i hope in the next squad movie they killer croc fight king shark
CmRih_VtVAs,"I thought the ""damaged"" shit wasn't going to be in the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Suicide Squad will save DCU. Can't wait for August. Excited as fuck. Wonder Woman was great in BvS tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who loved batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,bvs was great
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be the start of the DCU.....
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like the Joker in this was way overdone. In my opinion he's more of a mental, drug addicted, serial killer. Whereas Heath's Joker (which is what every joker should try to be)was dark and sinister and calculated, while using some joker humor. Leto ruined it for me I'm sorry...the change is too much to take seriously."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just had a weird thought, what if this is a prequel to bvs and the guy who joker Is saying I just wanna show you my toys to is in fact Jason todd. Make sense as to why batman is hunting joker down in the batmobile as seen in the set photos food for thought."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks so good. Can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,BVS needs help from suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Would love to be the main villain in one of these movies!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn Delicia.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 THE BEST PART
CmRih_VtVAs,It feels like recent movies are using queen songs
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ooooooooooooo baby! Can't do this to me, baby!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I FACKING LOVE THIS MOVIE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
CmRih_VtVAs,Im just so amazed how this song goes so great with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know what song is playing in the background its great
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do they get these garbage directors? invest assholes.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I he only one constantly googling this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone got a boner of seeing Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 best scene
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who finds Harley hot?
CmRih_VtVAs,"HOW MORE THAN 11,000 DISLIKES i guess people dont like good movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v Superman in my opinion was good, but after hearing everybody else reviews on it, I'm having some bad thoughts about Suicide Squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm most excited for Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58-1:59. What is going on?
CmRih_VtVAs,DC Comics really needs this to be good....#batmanvsuperman #underwhelming
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is playing as Deadshot :)
CmRih_VtVAs,clint eastwoods son at 55 secs
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is BRILLIANT lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,I was getting sick of alot of superhero movie and coming out in 2019 2020..but I have a feeling this one can't wait and of course deadpool..that guys good ..cant think of his name was in a good action movie and was Bruce Willis' son in die-hard 12 which was surprisingly pretty good
CmRih_VtVAs,The part when Captain Boomerang drank some beer made me realize that this movie might be more of a comedy than an action movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:47 is that DeathStroke?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just pray and hope guys,just pray and hope...."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like DC's version of Deadpool so it better live up to the hype like Deadpool did
CmRih_VtVAs,Boulevard of broken suicide squad...
CmRih_VtVAs,YASSSS !!! CANT WAIT .... CARA <3
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll give the DCU one more chance...
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna see Captain Boomerang actually throw a boomerang.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Help us Suicide Squad, you're our only hope"
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:39 i love how slipknot punches the woman straight in the face hahahahah
take that feminism"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC taking a huge gamble with this but I think it will work out for them the same way Guardians of the Galaxy did for Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Should be a decent movie at least. After BvS, I am not in the mood for a bad DC film."
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the galaxy ripoff
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn ass damn
CmRih_VtVAs,He really does look a little like Jason Todd.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't care what the critics say, I enjoyed Batman v Superman, and I am sure I will enjoy this too! :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,redeem yourself with this movie for BvS DC!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Ben Affleck playing Batman in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does this movie look lighter and funner than BvS?
CmRih_VtVAs,this will shit all over Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 you're welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,what are the song？
CmRih_VtVAs,om om omg out one day before my birthday
CmRih_VtVAs,Even more promising than Avengers: Civil War
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is this release date sooooooooo far away. 😖😖😖
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the only hope for DC since Batman vs Superman sucked so much dick
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Harley doesn't sound like that""

Boohoo.If you haven't read the comics, I don't want you to say anything... period. All these dc movies and properties are taking inspiration from is the comics  and only the comics. Just because she isn't like how you saw or heard her in a video game or cartoon that doesn't mean this version of her won't do the character justice. If all they did was rehash, then what would be the point of making a new movie. Things change, grow up."
CmRih_VtVAs,so anyone knows what's that black thing they are fighting against?
CmRih_VtVAs,Any movie with Queen music is awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Im excited to see the movie but this trailer sux.  Its like whoever made it was high.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please don't fuck it up like batman v superman!
Please don't show the villian! Let us see him/her in the theatres"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is so different from the arrow witch I think had the original suicide squad 
(Spoiler happening look below to see the rest)





Dead shot dies 
So he's probably going to die in the movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,I miss the old Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,rip batmanvsuperman and now let pray for suicide squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,rip batmanvsuperman and now let pray for suicide squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone have an idea how many years prior to man of steel will this movie take place?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,They all act like they're cosplaying.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now that BvS failed, this is my last hope for DCCU"
CmRih_VtVAs,Gotta say DC is really finally putting out some exiciting movies don't think it'll top Deadpool though
CmRih_VtVAs,I went to seen batman V superman last night and when I heard the song I was already fangirling the the trailer continues and I almost screamed
CmRih_VtVAs,Why can't Harley at least he dressed in the outfit from Arkham city and not blue and pink
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP FREDDIE...
CmRih_VtVAs,this gave me a boner
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now that Dawn of Justice is out, I'm hoping that this will be better."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's now desperate and begging for this movie to be good after watching BvS???
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else find joker cute? :/
CmRih_VtVAs,i saw this trailer right before i saw batman vs superman and i shit in my fucking pants.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is anybody else disappointed with how killer croc looks???
CmRih_VtVAs,It's up to this movie to save the dceu...
CmRih_VtVAs,background music forsure is gonna be sick during the fight scenes xD!
CmRih_VtVAs,",.tHe JoKeR LOoks DUm BOoOOoooO"
CmRih_VtVAs,If that guy with the knives is meant to be Joker then it is horribly wrong
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie has to fix DC movie adaptations  because Batman v Superman was not that good and I have a feeling it will be a very good film for DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer I have ever seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,I was pumped about it I still am but Harley's voice is GONE
CmRih_VtVAs,1:21 The guy on the left looks like The Orb from original sin. Don't ask me why I know that. Please.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Every time I see this trailer, it just gets me even more hyped up for the movie. Maybe it's the song choice."
CmRih_VtVAs,here is to hoping this is WAY better than BvS. Come on DC... do something.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like Adam Beach is going to die in the opening credits lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide squad, your brother has fallen to the dogs. You are the last chance for the DCCU."
CmRih_VtVAs,"please don't make this movie as bad as BvS. pleaseeeeee :""("
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song of the beginning of the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is the final hope for DC
CmRih_VtVAs,This one and 'BvS' is actually in the same universe? No fucking way!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody....!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"who the fuck says ""WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA""  at 1:08 ??????????????"
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto going for that thin lanky moving joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think there is a price you could pay me that would entice me to watch this.
CmRih_VtVAs,why do people think this looks good... its so cheesy and too many effects... looks like something thatll maybe entertain a 10 year old. too much shite going on i cant relate to any of these cunts
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is disappointing. She doesn't talk at all like that. 🙄 she more New York American when she talks. And she's crazy as hell. This girl looks sane.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i´ve seen this trailer two million times. FUCK me god, i want to see this joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see deadshot is different now..Wonder if he is banging Harley yet to be politically correct . Someone had to change his identity as well.  NOPE , Except for bat-man I'm done D.C. Just more crap.. Unless DC stops kowtowing or at-least can create some new original  characters , better off waiting for IMAGE COMICS...  W.i.l.d. Cats , Spawn and the gang has a better chance against Marvel Franchise."
CmRih_VtVAs,There was a zipper right there why did he need to cut the body bag open 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"please be good, please be good ..( and yes im writing this after watching BvS)"
CmRih_VtVAs,shut up and take my money!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do people have a problem with the cast like seriously haven't you learned you lessen the cast of bvs was fantastic
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody! Fuck Yeah! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't get enough of the Joker's laugh
CmRih_VtVAs,"Most of these guys are Batman's foes and they're gonna be ""heroes""!? All i can say is WHY NOT? LOL"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow.  Are Brian May and Roger Taylor really this hard up for money at this point?
CmRih_VtVAs,#яшка
CmRih_VtVAs,it's joker guys
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like I have been waiting for this for years!!! I am so excited it looks amazing! Still wishing ledger was there ..
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker = Jesse Einsenberg ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Love it...
CmRih_VtVAs,i will see this movie it looks so good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sees BvS

Help me suicide squad you're my only hope 
Help me suicide squad you're my only hope 
Help me suicide squad you're my only hope"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well it can't be any worse than BvS...
CmRih_VtVAs,NOW I WANNA WATCH
CmRih_VtVAs,Song: queen bohemian rhapsody :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Speechless...
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so fucking good. I can't wait for this and Wonder Woman after seeing Batman v Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody starts playing I get excited.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn...yummy
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto. That's all I'm going to say
CmRih_VtVAs,I Really Want To See This Movie
CmRih_VtVAs,looks  like bad ass role  fr will
CmRih_VtVAs,90%. Batman's villains
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a simple man. I hear Bohemian rhapsody , I give likes."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can someone help me out, can't tell who it is at 1:44, they just stand still and go right through the centre of the train."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""WORST...JOKER.....EVER.."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"In the first fraction of the video, did they just use Queen?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is Harley quinn crazy so I'm going to love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"блять ну почему? ПОЧЕМУУУУУ ВО ВСЕ ФИЛЬМЫ СУЮТ ЭТОГО УЁБИЩНОГО АКТЁРА ИЗ КРЕПКОГО ОРЕШКА 5, терминатора и дивергента... ну он же никакой, почему он всзде?!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if feminist scumbags start whining about Harley Quinn being too beatuiful
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith is still wrongly casted.........  but that said this is gonna better then bat V sup.
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay I just saw batman vs superman (spoiler free) all I have to say is go watch it. Just phenomenal DC just came at the right time!
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"I would like to watch this in my local cinema but they""ll probably age restrict it like that movie 13 hours:Secret soldiers of Benghazi"
CmRih_VtVAs,"They should have had Tara Strong dub over for Harley, haha ah well, this movie is gonna be a blast"
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait for the movie! is gonna be a real shit. yeaaaaaaaaaah
CmRih_VtVAs,i have never enjoyed any trailer this much
CmRih_VtVAs,the Basilisk is the villain
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody comment section brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Is probably the best trailer I've ever seen. Bohemian raphsody cobined with movie sounds, you get me DC, I am Gonna see this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks sick and awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is one of the best trailers I have seen in long time, great mix with Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wouldn't it be hilarious if THIS was the DCEU movie that got the approval of majority fans/audiences/critics alike. 

It will take everyone by surprise and  WB will be scrambling to announce more villain-centric  films like Lobo/Black Adam because it seems their main icons are just not working for anyone."
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie looks like it has a lot of problems and I'm gonna point them out.....

1:WTF IS UP WITH HARLEY SHE LOOKS LIKE A DAMN WHORE!!!

10:at least tell peeps what its about they jus shoved a bunch of pics and scenes in your face and still act like your gonna jus know what your looking at 
11:I'm done....."
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,LOVE HARLEY AHHHH
CmRih_VtVAs,Katana!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"what is this song? Someone, tell me the name!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,deadshoot ...good .
CmRih_VtVAs,I've never really liked DC superheroes but the thing I've always loved was the villains. So an entire movie dedicated to a team of them seems really fun. I would love to watch this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 metacritic 100/100
CmRih_VtVAs,"At first I was interested in the movie, but poor staffing choices and characterization have killed it for me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"That was awesome.
These video editors deserve an award."
CmRih_VtVAs,what la the name of the last song?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a marvel fan and this looks fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one of the best put together trailers I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08
CmRih_VtVAs,Funny... the only hope left for DC universe right now up to these bunch of villains...
CmRih_VtVAs,who is it playing the joker ?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be total ectasy!
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont know i dont like the way the joker looks.. hope his acting wil be great... to be honest i think dean ambrose look more like the joker then this thing they did
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know it's probably a good thing Tom Hardy couldn't do the film, mostly because him and Jai Courtney look really similar at least based upon his appearance in this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,my daughter  loves Harley quen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hope this one to be much better than Batcock v Supershit, that movie sucks..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Guess I just have to look forward to this now after BvS....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Came here to trash the movie, and after watching the trailer I think the marketing team's actually done a great job. Now I'm kinda interested."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Theory! Suicide Squad will feature Jared Leto as Jason Todd brainwashed by the former joker, later to become The Red Hood. Margot Robbie's character is really playing The Joker's daughter (i.e. ""Daddy's lil Monster"") as the name Harley Quinn isn't mentioned in any trailer. She will don a prosthetic Heath Ledger Joker face and take on the mantle of the new 52's most terrifying villain!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,best song ever
CmRih_VtVAs,I just wanted this trailer to never end
CmRih_VtVAs,i hope nobody would jinxed this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,cara delevigne?? seriously?? wtf?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i just saw batman v superman and its awesome , i cant wait to see this movie this summer"
CmRih_VtVAs,The visual tone of this movie seems strikingly different from BVS.
CmRih_VtVAs,is that cara?
CmRih_VtVAs,When are we gonna get a new trailer? Usually one more will get released.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be one hellish ride! Can't wait to see this on the big screen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"NERDGASIM OHHHHHHH GOD IT""S EVERY WHERE"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jesus:

Listen to My voice as I call to you. Dear soul, entangled in the darkness of this world, it is to you I cry out. I am your Savior. I am calling to you loudly now because the time for you to hear My voice has arrived. No longer should you turn away from Me. Dear soul of the Kingdom, you belong with your family. Who is your family, you ask. We are your family. You have a great many souls here on earth who will love you but you must come back to Christianity. Christianity is simply the following of Christ. And who is this Christ? I am this Christ. I am Jesus, who died on the cross for you. 

My sacrifice made it possible for you to enjoy heaven. Let Me tell you about Me, so you will understand who loves you, and who you are being called to follow. I walked your earth as you do. I saw the failings of mankind as you see them. I was grieved at the injustices, in the same way that you are grieved when you see things that are not fair. Did I grow bitter? No. I did not. Why was that? Because I am God? No. I was God on earth but I was God trapped in man’s body and constrained by the limitations of the body.   

I did this so that when it came time for you to follow Me you could not say that it was easy for Me because I was God. I did not use My divinity except during the last three years and then only to heal, cure, and otherwise support My claim that I was the King of heaven, come down to lead all back to the Father. I did not waste miracles on those who would reject Me, regardless of proof of My divinity. Do you intend to reject Me? You are Mine, dearest soul. Come back to Me that I may introduce you to love and joy. I want to tell you why I did not grow bitter on earth. I did not grow bitter because I knew that many would follow Me. And I did not grow bitter because I knew that you would return to Me. Can you believe that you are that important to Me? I assure you, it is true. At this moment, there is only you and I. 

I am looking at you now. Will you return My gaze, you poor child whose heart is frozen? My love pours out upon you. My graces flow down to you. Open your heart, dear soul. Ask Me to come to you. I am here. I am waiting to love you. Do not freeze Me out any longer. Everything is possible for Me. I can heal you and cure you in an instant if you will let Me. Ask Me, dear child. You are part of My family and My family aches to have you back. I am calling you by name. Close your eyes and listen to My voice. I am asking that you say simply, “Jesus, love me.” I will take care of
everything else. You feel My presence now and you can rest in My love as I transform your heart. No fear, dear child. All is well when God is present, and truly, I am with you.


February 16, 2004 Direction for our Times"
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet some pervs are looking at harleys ass at the end
CmRih_VtVAs,i do
CmRih_VtVAs,I cannot wait im legally hype
CmRih_VtVAs,Stop WB! Im dealing with 2 other movies right now
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one that addicted to this version of bohemian rhapsody song
CmRih_VtVAs,its feel weird to see will smith is playing as deadshot since i've been watching dc tv series arrow and flash...I like how deadshot is in the tv series...but let see how well this movie goes...can't really judge a book by its cover
CmRih_VtVAs,I still hope this is not the real joker. I hope joker has already died and this is the brain washed Jason
CmRih_VtVAs,superman dies....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
CmRih_VtVAs,wait cara delevinge is also their rite!!
CmRih_VtVAs,but I'm confused why is Harley trying to kill her master ...... when she loves him and works for him
CmRih_VtVAs,best movie ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,"i just came for the song
 bohemian rhapsody -Queen"
CmRih_VtVAs,ha ha jokes on you
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is gonna be bad 
Because..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian rhapsody ""Queen"" bu fragmana daha iyisi olamazdı "
CmRih_VtVAs,I only care about Cara Delevigne.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did dead shot just say let's save the world?  Also there is an animated version of suicide squad. It's called batman assault on arkham and came out 2 years ago
CmRih_VtVAs,oooooow yeah it's going to be great movie WOW I'm going to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,My first thought a. Joker movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,why is there a girl in a all guy prison
CmRih_VtVAs,"If it didn't have that ""cara"" bitch in it I would be even more excited. Poor casting choice with her in it"
CmRih_VtVAs,"im more excited for this than batman vs superman, an i think its actually might be better than batman v superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone know what rating this would be for at the cinema's when it comes out? Deadpool was R16 here in New Zealand but I'm curious if it'll be the same because unfortunately I had to find other ways to watch Deadpool because of age restrictions.
I did minimal research to try & find out but what I read is that they would like to make it R13? although I can't really see this as an R13, I'm seriously curious, does anyone know?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"and i thought this would be a dark movie... but now they are the ""worst heroes ever"" ?!
oh come on i dont want another kick ass."
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel still stands in first place.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everything gets thumbs up from except for the Joker. I can respect a perfectly good interpretation of Joker and really do like this one. However, this is the same universe as Bat Affleck. They do not seem like polar opposites and it looks like Bat Affleck can kick his can any day without any problems. They do not balance each other at all."
CmRih_VtVAs,"not gonna lie, im not at all a dc fan but im really excited to see this"
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to see this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,11k Marvilibiers
CmRih_VtVAs,How great would it be in Stephan Amell Green Arrow showed up in this and was the crazy badass that he can't be on the PC CW
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 Alex Mercer in Suicide Squad confirmed.
CmRih_VtVAs,that was beauuuuuuutiful
CmRih_VtVAs,Soooooo excited asdfghjkl!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Johor.     Vidoe.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this tomorrow before Superman v Batman.
CmRih_VtVAs,My chicken popped off :v
CmRih_VtVAs,"hopefully this movie will redeem dc for superhero films this year, bvs turned out just to be a giant beautiful mess"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer should have more viewsss!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The force is strong with this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that the trailer has Bohemian rhapsody makes me wanna watch it even more
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this will be a better movie than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my globe evil panda on the loose and he has a gun XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"I kinda think they did ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" to promote this movie and i hope that the coming ""Justice League vs Teen Titans"" movie is to promote a, yet to be announced, live action Teen Titans movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,5 to 5 trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,song at 1:41 plss anybody tell
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey look its Robin.
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad and Civil War are gonna blow Batman V Superman out of the water. #CountOnIt
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody........
CmRih_VtVAs,"Once they come out , more excited to see it . Love this movie :3
Once they come out , i confirm watch it sia"
CmRih_VtVAs,Very nice ... Rate 8/10 because they show Batman fighting with them
CmRih_VtVAs,Aku suka lagi ngetren
CmRih_VtVAs,epic as hell!
CmRih_VtVAs,"im just asking here, is it the same story as the Suicide Squad WB Animation, were the squad will break apart and kill each other?"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:50 cara??
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE LOOKS FUCKING AWESOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to watch movie NOW!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dude. This trailer is filled with spoilers. 5 bucks says that their mission deals with the Joker and Harley Quinn betrays the rest of the team then suffers for it (as she always does because the Joker is an abusive, sadistic motherfucker.. and she suffers from Stockholm syndrome hardcore). Like I said this is my guess not sure. So not actual spoilers. But that is what I got from the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,"How can 11,000 people dislike this, it looks so amazing! I'm really excited!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just remember, the Batman V. Superman trailers looked cool too, and look at what D.C did with that."
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy crap! This actually looks very good!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,My dad met Jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,this would be so much better rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,We're bad guys it's what we do ha
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is Oracle?
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope this is the film that redeems the DCEU...
CmRih_VtVAs,i give 10 for trailer and soundtrack/headblast
CmRih_VtVAs,this is gonna be awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or am I the only one who likes the way harley quinn looks in the movie but not The Joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see this (^_^)
CmRih_VtVAs,SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
CmRih_VtVAs,who else is here because of bohemian rhapsody ?
CmRih_VtVAs,This must be way better then deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, I'd be mad if humanity is wiped out by some meteorite/virus/nuclear war before I get to see this"
CmRih_VtVAs,owh thank you 😂😁😀😄😃
CmRih_VtVAs,Any body else notice at the end of the trailer when is shows suicide squad the Q looks the same as the statue of liberty mask from purge election day
CmRih_VtVAs,I love that Cara is in this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I lost it when Harley said,""We're bad guys, it's what we do!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"First Impression: alright
Second impression after letting it sink in: Ya know, a lot of people say this will blow. Why? It's trying something different. I like how it has of a bit of a ""splash colored"" Noir look, but i'm more worried about Dawn Of Justice. Dawn of Justice is trying to be like Marvel, and set up DCU too quickly. This however looks so much better IMO because how it actually LOOKS new. Sorta like Sin City meets Reservoir Dogs. I rather go see this ANYDAY than Dawn of Justice. And that ending to the second trailer looked awful. And Zod is Doomsday? Great, now i WONT see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST CANT COME FAST ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
CmRih_VtVAs,who is gona watch the movie only for will smith
CmRih_VtVAs,is it an 18??????
CmRih_VtVAs,is it pg13?
CmRih_VtVAs,that song is the best song ever. especially when covered by a drunk Brendon urie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this. xDD
CmRih_VtVAs,"I swear if I die before August 16th, which is the date this movies comes out, then the place I am going won't be able to rest."
CmRih_VtVAs,Toys......We ALL NEED Toys!!! Muahahahahahahaha!
CmRih_VtVAs,I have never watched a trailer so many times
CmRih_VtVAs,THE BEST TRAILER & OST  EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"*""I can't WAIT to show you my toys!""*
I'm really looking forward to Jared Leto as The Joker..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg ! Harley never used fucking Deagle ! Kill me please
CmRih_VtVAs,"This song is fitting so good , God bless the editors are great"
CmRih_VtVAs,I would love to see an R rated cut of this movie. The Joker in that sort of environment would be absolutely terrifying!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn makes being a super villain look so much fun.. ""we're bad guys.. it's what we do."" 😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else just doesn't read the comics they just watch the movies ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im already having dreams about being in the cinema watching this...
Is that weird?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"II honestly never expected DC to make an Suicide Squad movie, but now that they have, better read the comics another 100 times."
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP slipknot
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,am i only one who can see that joker got his girl in this flick?
CmRih_VtVAs,i miss heath ledger. he was the perfect joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"see Ghostbusters, That is what a GOOD trailer looks like."
CmRih_VtVAs,black manta for suicide squad 2
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley and Joker😍
CmRih_VtVAs,want a taste of the movie might be like? definitely go watch Batman:Assault on arkham!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything is amazing except Harley's voice. Where's her high pitched voice?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF happened to The Joker!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley: ""What's that you want me to kill everyone and escape? 😂 hahaha I'm kidding that's not what they really said 😈"" 
Me: *Boner intensifies* ""O.O I think I'm in love"" XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"That's how you do a trailer. Regardless of if the movie turns out to be good or bad, this will always be a great trailer. It gets you pumped."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this movie going to do something never before seen in a DC movie? Is is going to be... FUN?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like this won't be that great
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley looks great. As long as Margot Robbie can channel the childish, quirky madness of the character then she's done her job, no matter what her outfit looks like."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life? YES.
CmRih_VtVAs,are people still fighting over marvel and dc? i'm just glad there's going to be more than 2 superhero movies this year. 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn: I SHOULD KILL EVERYONE?!

This is #SquadGoals <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,So Will Smith chose THIS mess instead of Independance Day: Resurgence? LOL.
CmRih_VtVAs,Brilliant trailer. Lets hope the movie is anywhere near as good.
CmRih_VtVAs,THE JOKER WINS :}
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is taking over
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone know what it will be rated like 12 or15
CmRih_VtVAs,I just feel this is going to be hot garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't get it.  Where is Batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk what gonna happen with the movie but I love this trailer so much
CmRih_VtVAs,Dead shot really why not death strok?
CmRih_VtVAs,I got a question why dose Harley Quinn have blue and red hair instead of red black
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,The comments section in Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"There's already a suicide squad movie, and it's called assault on Arkham, and it's good."
CmRih_VtVAs,love how the beat went with every scene
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quin can get all this d bruh
CmRih_VtVAs,sorry to disturb but what is the name of the song? plz don't hurt me......😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
CmRih_VtVAs,"This SUICIDE SQUAD trailoer mixed with Queen's music is beyond
good, beyond excellent -  an unforgettable masterpiece !!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn and Joker are just...disappointing
CmRih_VtVAs,Ends up they'll kill each other and Harlequin will kill Joker out of rage CatWoman will appear and Superman and the Justice League will to stop them
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love Queen and Bohemian Rhapsody, but the song does not match the video. It just doesn't..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks badass
CmRih_VtVAs,Never shout never hood where you at?
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that they managed to perfectly align it with Bohemian Rhapsody makes me fangirl every time I watch it! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Missing Heath Ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't care what anyone says..Harley is insane and the Joker is far more worse..and though he doesn't and never really loved her, she makes him feel alive.. .and she will always belong to him.. ."
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this looks great. Not a huge fan of what we have seen of Harley Quinn but we have almost seen nothing and Margo Rovi is hot. Best movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,They go to Gotham City.
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck this shit
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody😍
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is coming out in August 2016?! Iam not going to survive that.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this doesn't look as dark as it should like the comics, not to mentioned - SPOILERS - the joker is dead in the first comic anyway so I have no idea why he is in it as a main character. I feel like they're going too much for the funny appeal and not actually sticking to what the comics were and the idea of them, but it is an interpretation and I'm probably going to enjoy it anway"
CmRih_VtVAs,I am waiting for cara delevingne 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara looks so awesome <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"_I think this is the film for non-comic fans. I love these characters, but this trailer was boring. I don't even want to see it now._"
CmRih_VtVAs,"IS THIS THE REAL LIFE?

NO, THIS IS PATRICK"
CmRih_VtVAs,tbh just gonna watch this for harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"So far, Harley is my favorite character, but if Catwoman is in this, I will lose my mind."
CmRih_VtVAs,i love the dark side of DC
CmRih_VtVAs,"I need this movie now
*makes grabby hands*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear DC and Warner: I want ""Swamp Thing"" and ""Doom Patrol"" movies. Or better yet series, on HBO or somewhere like that.

Get on that, would you?

Sincerely,
Yohei72"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hyped!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll be honest this looks more fun then Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"you chose deadshot over deathstroke? we saw deadpool, so cmon already!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I was never a DC fan but this looks great
CmRih_VtVAs,"My year's gonna be full of comics. Suicide Squad, BvS, Civil War, X-Men. I just can't wait! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,God such creepy heroes :3
CmRih_VtVAs,My place we can see the movie already but u have to wait till August?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hello mr eyeball!
CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't look that good.
CmRih_VtVAs,is it me or is it weird to be into crazy chicks
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's Joker laugh nearly made me cry. So awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,i want to see the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn is my idol. It sux she doesn't have an accent. And can anyone explain the blue? I always loved red and black, not blue."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara YASSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,wooow
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this is a great trailer 
Didn't spoil much but kept me complete on edge the whole way through loved the timing with the music aswell great choice"
CmRih_VtVAs,My favourite song!!! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,robbie is boring and she does not look hot here
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats last song name ???
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, I saw a very interesting theory that MIGHT be possible. Wondering if anyone else agrees. Who thinks the joker is 'jason todd'?
In Batman vs Superman, Bruce says a very interesting thing to Alfred: ""12 years in Gotham, how many good guys are left? HOW MANY STAYED THAT WAY?""...could that be a hint towards Jason?

Also if you look at Joker's tattoos: There is a 'J' (other than Joker, could it hint to Jason), there is a Feather tattoo (represent robin), the Joker seems to know about Bruce's past ""You let your family die""...

Thoughts???"
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie looks so fucking terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,"this over ghostbusters and dawn of justice, COMBINE!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"How to register for suicide squad member? I want to join this team and kill Batman , Superman and if thats possible also the team ironman and captain america in marvel. ."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys""
Lol😂😂😂 I can't wait for this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 moment - i`ll just leave it here
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the kind of film you see only because everyone else is going to see it. There is no other reason.
CmRih_VtVAs,So it seems the Joker is the bad guy amongst the bad guys
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me who wants to know what the voices said?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is there Tom Hardy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer made this movie more anticipated than batman vs superman 
Civil war and xmen combined"
CmRih_VtVAs,mv
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is badass
CmRih_VtVAs,who are the hero's  names
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think that Bo-Rap worked with the trailer ut I think that Don't Stop me Now, (also by Queen) would have worked"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is going to smash Marvel with their movies this year and also the coming years. RIP Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh i wish Freddie was alive so i can see his expression lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Wtf the joker looks so fucking disgusting
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not trying to be offensive or rain on the movie because it looks amazing but does anyone know why Chris brown was casted as dead shot? From what I know the original dead shot character is white.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like this song, Justin Beiber is such a good singer"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks Cool but spidey is finally in avengers movie so DC you are still in the second place..
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish they had casted Jessica Nigri as Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,I know will smith wanting a Grammy for this
CmRih_VtVAs,But I cannot wait till this movie come out! this looks awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody? yes ples
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else would rather see a movie about bad guys but I would love to see batman vs superman 100000000x more!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Please changes harley quins vocie
CmRih_VtVAs,They need to make another trailer and the only problem I have is that in the comic isn't deadshot a white guy
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it August yet.......?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I find it funny that this is the song I did a performance to. The only song I did a performance to out of the 10 we did.
Oh, and I was the bad guy.

Also, the movie looks like a generic super hero video with your generic video game plot."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ive never been more intrigued by a trailer.. ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey
CmRih_VtVAs,was that a residents mask at 1:22 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Me encanta:-D
CmRih_VtVAs,whomever composed this trailer needs a fcking medal
CmRih_VtVAs,this actually looks kinda dumb. i mean i will probably end up whatching it opening night but it looks kinda just like they mashed up all the bad guys and had them scream and shoot at stuff and call it a movie. not really any character interaction whatsoever.  but im waiting till the next trailer to finanlize my judgement. still looks fun to whatch an a perfect example of eye candy
CmRih_VtVAs,Going to be one of the best movies of 2016.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think we'll see Enchantress much in the movie which is a shame because she seems like an interesting character.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"I FU***NG LOVE HIM
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011494486329"
CmRih_VtVAs,"so great, can't wait for the movie, I hope bohemian rhapsody really be on the soundtrack, its kind of perfect for this poor looser already dead on life :-) ..hope the movie be as crazy as hell, I still think that DC movie are a little better to the marvel ones, marvel is too much movies too little in each, DC less movies but little better..."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 Relationship goals.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't help but feel like the joker is unintentionally the main star in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith should be in marvel's not dc's
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY I had to check if my music was playing
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't make up which team is good and which is bad. Everyone is so bad ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hancock suicid squad haha
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sometimes I cringe heavily when I see a comment such as:
""Whats the song""
""I learned this song cause of this trailer""
""Lol, never heard of this song"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why word ""Bismillah"" have slower pronounce??"
CmRih_VtVAs,That Harley Quinn doesn't look like her character at all. She just looks like some blonde bimbo.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the actor os Harley Quinn that model from Victoria secret? Idk she just looks like her...
CmRih_VtVAs,"those dc villain trying to be hero when all the superheroes are fighting each other, maybe there will be ""Evil Avenger"""
CmRih_VtVAs,u all need to look into ur dc stuff coz quite clearly this aint the real suicide squad dont get me wrong still looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,Song please ?
CmRih_VtVAs,what the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG #LOVEHARLEYQUINN ^O^
CmRih_VtVAs,Premiere is at the same time as my Birthday *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney is one fine ass human being
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this! and I for one love how they portrayed Harley. I've seen people criticize her outfits and hair but it is pretty accurate if you follow the comics and even the video games.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Two things.

1). Jared Leto has fucking GOT this shit. He legit seems like he REALLY wants to injure that dude.

2). I have a really, really funny feeling that Jai Courtney is going to walk away with this movie. I don't know what's going on with his character, but he seems hilarious.

Oh, also, HOLY SHIT Scott Eastwood is handsome. Just...y'know....leave some pussy for the rest of us, dude."
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is on point with superhero movies this year. they are all unique
CmRih_VtVAs,"Goes without saying, but Queen's awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,August is so far away 😔
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show u my toys"" slaps a guy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wanna see this movie, but I don't want to be judged by the know-it-alls that I know nothing about the Suicide Squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,so epic omf
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Heath Ledger was alive, he wouldn't let that movie goes to Cinemas. The Joker represented by Heath was much acceptable than Jared Leto's joker. I think that the personality of the joker died when Heath died. Until another great actor comes to play the role of the joker, the only one who played that role perfectly was Ledger, It does not mean that Jared is bad, but Jared was not serious about the role of the joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Waiting Each Day For The Movie !
CmRih_VtVAs,That moment when Suicide Squad looks better than Superman V. Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,this jokers gonna be the best with Nicholsons portrayal behind him. heath behind Nicholson
CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly really want to see this movie. Harley looks great! Sure she doesn't have the accent but c'mon, this is modern and real life! The accent would be cheesy! The action will be great! It seems to have the balance of humor and seriousness correct. However, this is only the trailer. Joker looks fucking amazing!!! I cannot wait for this movie! Definitely my most anticipated film of the year!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anybody else see the Chinese woman from Arrow
CmRih_VtVAs,So many jokers over the past years and I honestly think this is one of the best
CmRih_VtVAs,It's like the purge just more fucking insane
CmRih_VtVAs,They still haven't completely finished the movie yet
CmRih_VtVAs,the song matches with the trailer so well
CmRih_VtVAs,It's gonna suck
CmRih_VtVAs,0:26 Will Ferrell?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Was Harley Quinn always blond? I thought she had brown hair
CmRih_VtVAs,suicide squad putlocker search it up about to watch it now will reply to my comment about the quality :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"DEADPOOL, CIVIL WAR, DAWN OF JUSTICE, AND SUICIDE SQUAD? BEST YEAR EVER!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know it's pretty unlikely, but I hope deadshot takes on more of a leader role. He'd be perfect for it."
CmRih_VtVAs,what is it reated
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 replay button
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's be honest Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker might be a tad better than Heath Ledger's version
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hell YES! Looks amazing. Let's face it, we've waited way to long for a live action Harley Quinn. =0)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm here because I saw the comments on Bohemian Rhapsody original video.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who saw Katana.I mean she is not bad. She was actually a hero if I remember correctly.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2 minutes, 31 seconds of... *AWESOMENESS!!!!*"

CmRih_VtVAs,"I am more excited about Katanna, but harley quinn kinda seems cheesy"
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody 😊
CmRih_VtVAs,不错哟，这个妹子像冰与火之歌里面的那个龙母，挺漂亮的。不知道什么时候上映，我肯定会去看的，可惜电影配额制一年只有五十部，奶奶的。i love that girl.

CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so hot
CmRih_VtVAs,Star of this Trailer: Jay Courtney finally doing some acting! Yeah they really gave me nothing to really care about Jared Letos Joker. I have to wait for the movie I think.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto is the BEST Joker ever!
I want more scenes with the Joker <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,the new call of duty looks so nice.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer I ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly after seeing the animated version I'm not quiet as excited anymore. Will Smith just looks like will smith the funny guy. Jared leto joker reminds me of some mafia guy instead of bat shit crazy joker. I hope they prove me wrong if not atleast xmen, deadpool and other movies are out this year as well."
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 ""Seriously what the hell is wrong with you people"" she wanted an expensive purse for free, what's wrong with that lol 😂😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,This song alone makes this the greatest movie trailer ever!! R.I.P. Freddie Mercury
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel is better...
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a die-hard Batman fan. I'm more excited for this film than Batman v. Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jay Courtney doing his best impression of Tom Hardy here...
CmRih_VtVAs,"All the sudden everyone loves joker now
Its like yesterday they wur just talking crap about the clown"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who got excited when they showed Kitana's soultaker and enchantress with that energy around her?
CmRih_VtVAs,damn if only tom hardy stayed in this movie! !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone come here just to listen to Bohemian Rhapsody like me?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The movie looks like it's gonna be great, but the song in this trailer is a huge disappointment.

There are way better rock songs they could have chosen... It just makes the trailer look corny, but I know the movie isn't, by actually focusing in on the costumes, graphics, & dialogue.. Smh."
CmRih_VtVAs,If freddy mercury himself was in this abortion it would still suck
CmRih_VtVAs,"jared letos joker reminds me of a slightly autistic 17 year old whos into my little pony, kicking hamsters, and not bathing. Ya know, just like the target audience for this snoozefest."
CmRih_VtVAs,this movies gonna be so stupid lol. its G rated just like the cheese it is.

CmRih_VtVAs,all of you everyone I know more about them even the song so yea that's is
CmRih_VtVAs,11k of Marvel fanboys.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else here who agrees with me on that it was ingenious to play ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" within this trailer?! It fits and transitions with the scenes so perfectly. Also makes me anticipate the hell out of this movie. :))"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I AM A SHARK.
Thumps up if u got that reference,Lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here

CmRih_VtVAs,the best i could take from this was Queen :C
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone else think him carry would make an amazing joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,the C in DC Comics stands for Comics? So saying DC Comics is like saying Detective Comics Comics. ??? LOL .....  or the correct name is DC Entertainment .... that would be like saying  ..

CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is full of occult fuckery

CmRih_VtVAs,the dong its called Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,Another guardians of the galaxy trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly so happy and proud that these super hero movies aren't giving into these dumb fuck feminists. We wanna see sexy women fighting, not overweight, unhealthy, ugly women.""Thats not a real woman"". Bitch this isn't a movie about a real world, that's why all the guys have six packs and kick ass, it's fantasy."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whoa, this seems to have that thing that every other DC movie seems to lack . . . fun!

For the first time, I'm slightly interested.  At the very least, it was a good trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF NO DEATHSTROKE RIP IHML PLZ JUST AND A CAMEO OR SOMETHING PLZ
CmRih_VtVAs,what is it rated ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I am already so attracted to this version of the Joker...
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is the best trailer of any movie ever. great music, great shots, just enough exposition. amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is possibly the most well edited movie trailer I've ever seen. Sure, other trailers give more action that what was seen here, but how artistically brilliant this is is unbelievable."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who are they fighting against? who they shooting?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jack Nicholson: Gangster Joker
Heath Ledger: Anarchist Joker
Jared Leto: Psychopath Joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,umm... the TV show is better. ..
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS TRAILER GOT ME SO HYPED
CmRih_VtVAs,The problem with this trailer is I'm not sure the movie could live up to it
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is what happens when heroes fight each other,... Villans have to take over"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is everyone hyped up for joker? I get that they have to do something new with him, but the dark knight joker set the bar way too high, and this joker is barely mediocre. I'm excited to see the squad in action not this lame ass joker."

CmRih_VtVAs,That makes me want to finally go see a comic flick in cinema !
CmRih_VtVAs,That Joker will never surpass the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like the best movie ever😈❗
CmRih_VtVAs,This is such a catchy trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool vs deadshot at wrestlemania 32 book it vince!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"“It’s about [Harley] breaking free of The Joker and becoming this fully actualized, independent person,” Ayer explained. “That really is a metaphor for everyone’s journey here.” NO. I am not interested in watching some crappy super powered lifetime movie about a woman who breaks free of her abusive relationship and finds love with a troubled ex con single dad."
CmRih_VtVAs,to be honest I'm thankful there is no rated R in Suicide Squad if there was MY PARENTS WOULD NEVER
CmRih_VtVAs,song from 1:22 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker: "" I can't wait to show you my... TOYS""
Me: ""that's what she said"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Aww... I wish Harley had her accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm guessing Margot Robbie got that last quote ""It's what we do"" from the Geico commericals, and also does anyone know why they're called the suicide squad?  Cause I highly doubt any of them will end up committin suicide in this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sold on Leto as the new Joker. And Harley Quinn looks like...Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie nailed it. This movie is going to be a MASTERPIECE.
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is so good i could fap to it
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Were bad guys it what we do"" like make bad jokes eh hem Joker cough cough"
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain Boomerang #1 !

CmRih_VtVAs,PERFECT SONG CHOICE OHGOD MY HEART
CmRih_VtVAs,Even when Dc is making a fun movie its still dark and gritty as fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Deathstroke should come around as well. It would be awesome just like the comics.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara.
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype is real. I usually don't like movies and hate super heroes movies. But this one ... I can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol,I bet there's some people who have never heard of this and thinking ""Suicide Squad?""
Lol, but I can't wait to see this"

CmRih_VtVAs,Hancock? is that you Hahaha :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have never cringed so hard at a movie character in my life. Harley Quinn just...ok. The only good thing she has going for her is that she's really hot. That's it. The whole ""Sorry, the voices. I'm kidding! That's not what they really said..."" Oh my god I'm gonna kill a ferret. I liked Harley Quinn up until now. But I am, however, wanting to see the Joker portrayed by Jared Leto. That's gonna be fantastic."

CmRih_VtVAs,song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,Dark Knight was great and didn't have an R rating. Don't lose hope people
CmRih_VtVAs,"God damnit, they had to use Bohemian Rhapsody to appeal to me...."
CmRih_VtVAs,if only this was rated R. Reminds me of Watchmen
CmRih_VtVAs,Noobs. This isn't the first Suicide Squad movie.

CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rapsody y suicide squad el duo perfecto
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait till this comes out
CmRih_VtVAs,In the comics arkham knight is stalking suicide squad for a little. So there suicide squad are doing something and arkham knight is setting up his army with deathstroke then him and scarecrow team up to defeat the batman.
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto is perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else get done watching the Civil War trailer and then come back here to get excited?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Is this the real life""?
""Cause this movie is so shitty"".
""Caught in a landslide"".
""Let me escape this reality""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Every time I see this I keep wondering: Are the guys in the masks maybe the False Face Society?   Does that mean Black Mask might be around somewhere?   He DID try and hire the Joker before so maybe they're doing something like that here.
CmRih_VtVAs,They had to film this shit in punkass Canada huh.
CmRih_VtVAs,It been a while since there a good dc movie cause I'm not 100% sure batman vs superman will be good
CmRih_VtVAs,"To the kids that are thinking of looking up the song and then commenting about how this video brought you there; just don't. By all means listen to it, it's the best rock song in the history of anything ever after all, but don't say that this video brought you there, that's not something you should be proud of."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Although Heath simply can't be topped, I'm still quite excited to see an actor like Jared portray the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,This will blow Marvel out of the water
CmRih_VtVAs,I've lost count on how many times I've watched this
CmRih_VtVAs,Croc is definitely my man...
CmRih_VtVAs,It feels like Guardians of Galaxy movie with Batman villains
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is Mr.Wayne?  he is among the cast
CmRih_VtVAs,why is will smith playing deadshot in this movie when they have a perfectly fitting deadshot actor in form of Michael Row in Green Arrow?
CmRih_VtVAs,What is it rated?

CmRih_VtVAs,this was one of the best trailers i have honestly ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,"The comment section here is MUCH better than the comment section in the facebook post. Dont go to it, theres a LOT of ppl keep bitching and whining like immatures."
CmRih_VtVAs,The fucking song makes the movie worth watching.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dammit this year is going to be so fucking epic woth all of these amazing superhero movies from both companies dammit i love!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"If only IMDB had a Top 250 for trailers, this sure as hell would be The Shawshank Redemption."

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm quite eager to see Jay Leno's portrayal of Joker. I honestly can't fuckn wait for this to drop!!! so excited!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly this looks pretty good. At least it seems way more entertaining than X-Men: Apocalypse Probably also more entertaining than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm insanely excited to give this movie a try
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn's original Red and Black Jester outfit totally beats this horrible skanky, slutty, incorrect colored costume(if that's what you call it)

CmRih_VtVAs,"love, love , love this trailer !! whoever edited it is a genius, super exited to watch it :) xx"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. A trailer for a comic-book movie that isn't swarming with haters below.
CmRih_VtVAs,why does one of the look like the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"what is the song in the last "" leave me to die"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"People asking what the song title is...seriously, are you really that thick?

And I'm not hearing the iconic Harley Quinn voice here...not saying it's a deal breaker, but if Margot Robbie doesn't perform it at least once in the movie, it's going to be weird as hell."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks awesome ... i hope this is not false advertising and it has a completely different tone then advertised
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it August yet? 
No? 
Ok...I'll just watch this on repeat until then."
CmRih_VtVAs,Seen this so many times OMG SO HYPED FOR THIS 
CmRih_VtVAs,This was kewl
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name of the songs?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is just my opinion but, 

Tell me that is not the hottest version of Harley Quinn you've ever seen in your life......"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:51. This is love this is love this is love
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anything with Will Smith (no homo), Queen soundtrack, exploding everything and hot Asian assassin has to be awesome. Cant wait."

CmRih_VtVAs,Queeeeennnnm
CmRih_VtVAs,♥♡♥♡♥♡♥♡♥ LLEVO MESES ESPERANDOTE YA TE QUIERO VER!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,a sequel was already greenlite
CmRih_VtVAs,watchmen was r rated & look what happened to it. granted it deserved that rating but look at how much money it made which wasn't a big success
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm way more hyped for this than any other  Marvel/DC movie coming out.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks so boring and cliche, but then again movie trailers usually are different from the actual movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,every time i watch this trailer i like this joker more and more
CmRih_VtVAs,why make such a good trailer so early???? you think that belle reve is torture? waiting after this trailer is real torture.
CmRih_VtVAs,Tom Hardy would've been perfect on this :(
CmRih_VtVAs,I think it's going to be a great movie but a terrible adaptation
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't freaking wait for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,katana!
CmRih_VtVAs,"harley quinn's lines and mannerisms seem to be modeled after a cringey middle school girl who describes herself as ""so random XDXD."" I'll watch it, but I have super low expectations."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm ashamed to see what Harley Quinn has become.
CmRih_VtVAs,What genres is this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,"For those saying this should be rated R, that would be great if this were a standalone film but since it ties into the new DC Cinematic Universe, they dont want hella nudity and gory scenes in one movie and a watered down cameo in another. Though I think this movie is going to push the limits of PG13."
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am i the only one who completely loves the purple, pink and blue colors?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Parece un AMV Pro' , =)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever had the idea to use a Queen song for the trailer... you rock!!
CmRih_VtVAs,eeeeee cant wait luv who they got for harley quinn perfect whole reason i wanta watch. luv the part where her and joker r n water and their colors form heart ammazing💜🙊😹
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see Mr. Waylon Jones rip some motherfuckers apart
CmRih_VtVAs,panda kills lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"quite frankly I don't know who is Tom Hardy and I don't give two fucks about him. Jared is the one I care about, since fight club, love him. and the 10 fucktars who disliked this movie is obviously that they have shit instead of brains. Joker jumping at the pool of chemical shit to save Harley. one word: BEAUTIFUL"
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol not alone Hal, I watch it all the time too :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,At some point I think that DC is more badass than MARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,better then bat vs super
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer looks crap. I wish the movie will be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 .... a love story needed to be added huh?
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,If we're getting a Rated R cut of Batman V Superman THIS is definitely getting one.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song name ?

CmRih_VtVAs,By far best movie trailer ever made.!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Deathstroke should be in this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,There holding Batman back now but once BvS comes out I bet he's all over the marketing campaign
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why does everyone think Jason Todd is the Joker? ACE Chemicals pretty much confirms that they're going the Red Hood storyline, Joker is a completely different guy. Joker ends up killing Jason, and when Jason comes back he comes after the Joker. Jason being Joker was funny at first but it's insane people really think that's the route they're going"
CmRih_VtVAs,"A little off topic but, I really like Joel Kinnaman as an actor. I'm so glad he's in this :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Please be R rated please be R rated!
CmRih_VtVAs,Song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,if this movie is half as good as the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel sorry for the MCU....

Can't wait ^^
Harley is my favourite female comic villain ever"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really love that Harley is finally getting some appreciation for once because no one really knew who she was and she's a great character.

CmRih_VtVAs,"At 1:20 when the Joker tells someone he can't wait to show him his toys, no one has mentioned that this person looks a lot like Scott Eastwood whose identity in this film has been kept under wraps. Can't believe no one's said anything about this."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Come on, not every movie suit for R-rating, are you going to persuade the studio to release a R-rated film for their third film? ignore huge audience group is a terrible idea in the early stage of DCU development."
CmRih_VtVAs,omg... they really put Bohemian Rhapsody in this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,im not fuckin sgined in m8
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice trailer I can't wait for this movie to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see this movie soooooo bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"WHERE İS THE ""BİSMİLLAH"" (!)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is bae.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jokers laugh at 1:29.....OMG.....
CmRih_VtVAs,The soundtrack to this trailer is so amazing. the fact that Captain Boomerang messes it up right before the climax fits his character😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kudos to whoever did the trailer.. it looks absolutely brilliant, as good as Fury Road's Retaliation trailer. Goddamn, I cannot wait for this movie. 
Unpopular opinion: I think Leto is going to do good in his role as the Joker. I don't care what anyone else says, I think he'll do great. Of course, he's no Heath but I think Leno will add his own twist to it (I hope). 
THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE EPIC (also, Katana looks awesome. I love her already)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"FFS, I bet there are junkies less addicted to heroin, than I'm addicted to watching this."
CmRih_VtVAs,epic as fvck
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like the Marvel movies, but this looks so fucking unique compared to those. The only really unique movie was Gotg which i didn't care for."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks the hype is gonna be too much and the film won't live up to it?
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfection.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jesus Christ. Harley is fucking gorgeous.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably the only DC movie I've actually been excited for
CmRih_VtVAs,Esse coringa ele ta de zoeira ele qué apronta
CmRih_VtVAs,I literally can't watch this garbage.
CmRih_VtVAs,FIRE PETER ROTH ....
CmRih_VtVAs,Hahahaha reminds me of Glee XD
CmRih_VtVAs,what's it rated
CmRih_VtVAs,10 bucks will and Margo bang in the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Now make one with don't stop me now
CmRih_VtVAs,SO STOKED!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:29 There's nothing in his pockets but knives, a lot of knives, some guns, a lot more knives, a few Molotovs and grenades, and holy shit a lot of more knives"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Illuminati film at its best, wont stop me from seeing it, but in the scene where Harley smash's the window for the purse the drawings are black and white, symbolism of masonry and you see serpents devouring each other and the shirts within the circle of serpents have the phrase  Si Vi Pacem Para Bellum. This translates to if you want peace, prepare for war."
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer song?
CmRih_VtVAs,of the best trailers ive se en from start to the ending
CmRih_VtVAs,i love when movies use rock
CmRih_VtVAs,A song by Queen is just cheating
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be the funnest movie this year.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have no intention of EVER seeing this movie.
If any of you in the comments plan on seeing this film, fine; I won't stop you.
The thing is, I WOULD see this movie if it was about people like Booster Gold, Blue Beetle and/or Plastic Man getting wrongfully put in jail and having to track down someone like The Trickster in exchange for their freedom, à la Guardians of the Galaxy (wherein a group of good-hearted lovable rogues/criminals are the main focus).
The only problem is, that's NOT the film we're getting here.
You see, the so-called ""heroes"" of this film are for all intents and purposes terrible, terrible, homicidal monsters—honestly getting the Joker to track down Death Stroke is a pretty asinine idea on its own considering that the Joker is far worse than Slade Wilson could ever hope to be, and Amanda Waller is no better for letting him run free in exchange for him capturing Deathstroke."
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else already wanting to know who is in the sequel? praying for ivy since she was in the comics. would kill for a suicide squad with both harley and ivy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:45 is that the enchantress behind that guy? Why he saying: ""You possessed by a witch"" ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a good Kanye song but not my favorite. Maybe my 2nd.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just watched the new Ghostbusters trailer, it left a really bad taste in my mouth, pulled at my memories at the beginning and left me dissapointed near the end. So I needed to watch something to get that bad taste out, and I watched this trailer again for 107 time, I love this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"While I am looking forward to Batman V Superman more than Suicide Squad, this is probably the most fun I ever had watching the trailer. It's immensely amusing and enjoyable."
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked the other trailers for the other good movies this year but this one if my favorite . I've watched it alot
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooks so good.
CmRih_VtVAs,How old do you have to be to watch?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm extremely worried about this new Joker and the fact that there are so many characters.
This movie has to be at-least 2 hours or more."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've been waiting for 8 months, release the movie already I might die any day now! You know,coz life is unpredictable."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait so all this takes place in Gotham right, cus like that's where those villains are?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have figured it the joker is working with Darkseid clearly he's laying in the middle of the apocalypse symbol
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool and the Suicide Squad thank you god
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I keep laughing at the scene where it gets quiet, and all you hear is Captain Boomerang open a can of soda and drinking it, its probably during a fight to."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys reason to watch this: Margot Robbie, Cara Delevingne. Girls reason to watch this: Jared Leto, Jai Courtney"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who made this trailer? I want to shake their hands!
CmRih_VtVAs,isso vai ser uma merda sem tamanho!
CmRih_VtVAs,I love harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,So what? they too fucking scared to put Deathstroke in this thing?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder who the villain will be
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone think that this will be better then DeadPool?
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait to show you my toys!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this
CmRih_VtVAs,When did the joker get tattoos
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched this trailer at least 30 times so far. Can't wait till this movie hits theaters.
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a Marvel fan, I can say that this looks amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,yea this is going to be the best movie ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,i liked the other trailer a lot better
CmRih_VtVAs,1:19 I can't wait to show you DEEZ NUTZ. HA! :3 Gottem!
CmRih_VtVAs,what's up with jokers body at 1:58?
CmRih_VtVAs,0-o I'm so excited
CmRih_VtVAs,Let me out! COME ON!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm obsessed with this trailer. Seriously.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:21 is she supposed to be that fat black lady
CmRih_VtVAs,me too.
CmRih_VtVAs,im mr. carrots and im gaing be macking a youtube videos
CmRih_VtVAs,dafaq just happened.. every good actor in Hollywood is a part of the dc universe.. fuckyea...shit is just going to get real...can't wait to see the justice league on screen......😭😭😭😭😭😭
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 clearly gave the ending away
CmRih_VtVAs,MAMA MIA MAMA MIAAA
CmRih_VtVAs,This is it Jai Courtney...this is your shot at redemption. Die hard 5 and terminator will be forgiven if you put effort into this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen - We Are The Champion will be more suitable for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,SO FUCKING EXCITED. IVE SEEN THIS TRAILER LIKE 50 TIMES NOW OMGGG
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel are you taking notes?
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,If you don't understand some of the characters.......read more comics
CmRih_VtVAs,"I haven't been this excited about a movie in a very long time...I'm so PSYCHED!!!! Usually wait a couple weeks after a movie hits theatres to go see it, but I want to see this one right out of the gate! <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,"nice, bohemian rhapsody fits perfect with this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,who else thinks that this song is perfect for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,this in an amazing trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Killer croc looks fucking dumb -___-
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith as Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke!?....I'm ok with this
CmRih_VtVAs,Replaying until August! Eeee
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm just addicted to this trailer. I lost count on how many times I watched it
CmRih_VtVAs,JXD :] IM SO PUPMED TO SEE THIS MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,"I thought this trailer was fake, am still confused.  The other trailer is so good and this is so off...I almost don't want to see this movie now after watching this..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who paused at 2:07 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,it's coming out in too long
CmRih_VtVAs,If you look really close you will see that when killer croc body slams the dude his hand is like 2 feet above the guy he body slams.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is killer croc practical or Computer Generated Imagery
CmRih_VtVAs,can't stop wachting
CmRih_VtVAs,Wonder what rating this is probably a 15
CmRih_VtVAs,DC's answer to Deadpool but will it break records like pool tho???
CmRih_VtVAs,that's by far the coolest trailer i ever seen !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,WHERE ARE JOKERS EYEBROWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not sure I like Harley Quinn in this one. Her acting seems off.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dont really like margot robbie as harley quinn. Doesnt fit well
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,so they can put slipknot but not Shazam in the DCU OK WARNER FUCKS OK...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Much better than the first trailer IMO. The other one was way too ""edgy"" like wtf. Batman trailers aren't that dark. This one fits way better. Makes the movie look less like shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah bro
CmRih_VtVAs,The song was fucking horrible! Hate the new age bullshit music this trailer had. Fuck it.
CmRih_VtVAs,this will be my bday gift
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST use of this song. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,that was legitness
CmRih_VtVAs,Why isn't it August yet? T.T
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't tell you how many times I've watched this..but if this movie is as good as the trailer...Marvel is in for a fight.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cringe every time Margot Robbie talks
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like absolute shit
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of this song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker is so sick
CmRih_VtVAs,LOL love how he just came out that body bag and just punches the nearest thing closest to him lol no hesitation
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish this was rated R but I should just be happy this exists!
CmRih_VtVAs,song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,OPEN THE GATES. Trick 2g???????????????
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just saying, but nobody remember the ssquad now"
CmRih_VtVAs,still pretty shocked that hollywood is letting will smith play a white guy
CmRih_VtVAs,('O')
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith is a pussy for letting his son where a dress
CmRih_VtVAs,"When I see this joker, I kinda feel like seeing an older version of Joker in TV shows Gotham....."
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,2:05 best moment xD
CmRih_VtVAs,WAAAANNNTTTTT
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is clearly gonna be the funniest one in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,#Suicidesquad
CmRih_VtVAs,Lmfao wtf is this
CmRih_VtVAs,did I see a panda
CmRih_VtVAs,This is only the beginning of 2016.
CmRih_VtVAs,"a group of nutjob ""hero""s, nice.
where is deadpool?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith as Deadshot? dang.
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad Heath ledger is dead because I think he fit the role of joker better than this guy does
CmRih_VtVAs,cara delavigne is hot...
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,The editing with the song. Brilliant! 🎵🎵🎵
CmRih_VtVAs,thx
CmRih_VtVAs,"I look forward to seeing this, but I would have liked to see them add in Killer Frost."
CmRih_VtVAs,I honestly don't know why but I look up to the Jared leto. Especially the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"See, I think they did a good job of getting someone who literally looks insane to play The Joker, a character who is clinically insane xD Also, i get the feeling that just from this trailer, 500 new lemon fanfics appeared for Joker x Harley. I mean, there were probably already a million, but there's more! xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians 2 looks great! Oh wait...
CmRih_VtVAs,How to saving a kid movie? Put the best band of the world as soundtrack in trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadshot looks so awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,i always wanted to be a actor  not like it will happen:(
CmRih_VtVAs,no tendran exito con marylin manson con el pelo verde haciendo de joker
CmRih_VtVAs,The way how joker jumps like
CmRih_VtVAs,When does this movie come out?
CmRih_VtVAs,that one chick is fucking hot
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is awesome! I hope the movie is PG13.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm worried about will smith I think they probably put in Jason stantham as dead shot but let's see how will smith does in suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,everyone forgot the already existing suicide squad movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,who else is here because of Scott Eastwood's Instagram bio
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably I have made up like 25% of all the views on this video
CmRih_VtVAs,This still looks better than any marvel movies. DC for life
CmRih_VtVAs,"So from what I gather Jason todd (the second robin)  will be ""killed"" by the joker in this movie. hence the ""I'm not gonna kill ya, I'm just gonna hurt you really really bad"". in the BVS trailer a robin uniform with ""hahah"" spray painted can be seen. so Jason todd might show up as red hood in a third movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,<3
CmRih_VtVAs,lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys this I know movie's gonna suck and I haven't even seen it yet. And I'm not gonna. Play some real music, or at least the better version of this one, the one sung by Kanye. Besides, no one will ever beat Romero's joker! Ledger and Nicholson are fucking usurpers and this this transsexual being that calls itself Jared Leto isn't even a man!"
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever made.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is just like Mad Max: Fury Road.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'am the only one that is expecting more Zoolander 2? 😂😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who's more excited for this than for batman v superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else can't stop watching these trailers?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, it's PG-13 because it's for the kids who think they are so special and crazy because they always like the bad guys (the special snowflakes.  I think it would have been much better if they made this an rated R movie and focussed less on making them as cool and different as possible. And I really hope Harley Quinn is not just the cute sex object, like it seems here."
CmRih_VtVAs,who is 1:52 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,ha ha ha lol
CmRih_VtVAs,ahhh hahaha just wait until I show Milkey C my.toys
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuckin badass Jared Leto I love it whuu huuuuuu 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Joker a gay? Because he sucks dicks!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I love harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how the first look trailer was all suspenseful and scary, but then we got this. Oh, I love DC."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen song made this trailer epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Stop comparing two DC movies.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kinda, maybe, sorta, mashed the replay button over and over again. Whoops."
CmRih_VtVAs,im excited to see this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hands down one of the best trailers I've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie <3<3<3<3
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Margo steals this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"can someone explain what suicide squad actually is??
are they bad guys that are going to save the world??"
CmRih_VtVAs,Boomerang went insane...
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this is going to be something new. Can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,I FUCKING LOST IT WHEN I HEARD QUEEN PLAYING
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Voy a llorar de tantas ganas que tengo de que salga seguro que va a ser la mejor pelicula del año.
CmRih_VtVAs,I want the Dark Night version of the joker. But sadly he died
CmRih_VtVAs,Ive watched this trailer over and over
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not gonna lie, I'm looking forward to this for everything but Harley Quinn and The Joker. They're really stepping up the emphasis on them and it's not really that good looking, if anything it seems tacky, as for the rest of them, hell yeah. Can't wait to see Will Smith as Deadshot."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:02 Spoiler?
CmRih_VtVAs,this song is killing me
CmRih_VtVAs,That gun sync with the music is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie sounds like it would be created by Michael bay, George peppard(if he was a director and wasn't dead), and Chuck Norris."
CmRih_VtVAs,Esse joker will mitar mesmo
CmRih_VtVAs,same here
CmRih_VtVAs,i wanna watch
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish this would be an R-Rated film, it would be awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does every video on youtube have to have haters on it? Why do haters even exist? The only videos that don't have haters are the ones with zero views
CmRih_VtVAs,its beutiful
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hopefully this is Rated R. Parents and developers need to realize that, even though it's animated, there's still some cussing and violence, in comics and anime. But that's still part of what makes it good. Maybe they learned from how good Deadpool was."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:38 music ?????
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Fucking Trailer Ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Why the fuck do they show so much?? I feel like I have already seen the entire movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The cinematography in Suicide Squad and BvS is soo awesome, one of the best cinematography I've seen compared to other superhero movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,So overrated
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith will be deadshot?? shit
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else Depressed that we all have to wait till August 5th for this movie?😔
CmRih_VtVAs,I Quinn Harley wait to watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,"How many thumbs down? Over 10,000? Some dumb ass people lmao."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best Comic Book Movie Trailer ever? I think so.Prove me wrong.If there's a better one,I either forgot about it or can't think of it.Any of the X-Men,Batman,Superman, Green Lantern,Iron Man,Thor,Avengers,Blade,Watchmen,Judge Dredd,Hellboy,FF? Nope.Guardians Of The Galaxy had great music throughout the movie but a better trailer? Nope. Not even the great Deadpool's trailer could beat this one."
CmRih_VtVAs,"While I'm excited for this movie, I don't like Harley's costume because it doesn't have her black and red colors"
CmRih_VtVAs,DAT ASS!!! 02:06
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this...!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST FUCKING 5TH? FML
CmRih_VtVAs,When the movie comes out tell me if it was any good! please im from the past!
CmRih_VtVAs,i don't think Cara Delenvigne is a good actress
CmRih_VtVAs,me I think this pg13
CmRih_VtVAs,me I think this pg13
CmRih_VtVAs,Partly sad that Harley doesnt have her accent but she still acts cute
CmRih_VtVAs,"i have to admit, this trailer is pretty epic. but i can't help but be disappointed with the joker.. i mean.. yes the joker is crazy... but not that crazy.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't mind me just watching this trailer for the 30th time
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does The Joker look like a fuck boy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto better have done his homework for this role. Personally, I think he'll be a good Joker. But he's got big shoes to fill."
CmRih_VtVAs,"comic fans you should check  out Comic Animo! it's really good content, you find out some of the latest news, you meet people with the same interests as you, there's role play, it's really awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"killer croc looks shit. wish they made hin like in arkham origins, best looking killer cric in my opinion."
CmRih_VtVAs,what's it gonna be rated
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only girl who has a crush on Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Expectations will be the BANE of this movie....
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song
CmRih_VtVAs,CANT WAIT

CmRih_VtVAs,Whos The Japanese
CmRih_VtVAs,Whos The Japanese
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 is where the good shit goes down.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, bad movie officially confirmed."
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know... It doesn't feel like a joker movie
CmRih_VtVAs,40 millions  view - including my 1 million
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that Queen is playing makes this 20x better
CmRih_VtVAs,1:48 to 1:51 that's how you shoot Will.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who feels this movie DOES NOT need 3D?
CmRih_VtVAs,DC FANS ALWAYS INSULTING AND TALKING ABOUT MARVEL WHILE MARVEL FANS DON'T GIVE A FUCK LOL XDXD
CmRih_VtVAs,"Este es sin duda el mejor trailer que he visto hace mucho, es divertido, tiene buena musica y te emociona, se aleja de los cliches de los ultimos trailers"
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks so good but it looks like its going to be 16 and rated R

CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley looks like Emily Autumn, but she is so underwhelming in the trailers . . . More like a rich brat than fucking crazy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:03 through 1:36 was the only part I kept watching.
I mean dat gun drum doe at 1:04"
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't see deathstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,"back to life,back to reality."
CmRih_VtVAs,"casting the austrailian actor as wolverine is like casting Jack Nicholson as tinkerbell

.. u know it works and u know the level...so upstairs u swallowed pride and went with him.  Not  one of you has read a comic. who is the dickhead now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"ws

seems ok but still american. haowas about i link p with Marvel and make wolverine real: everybody thinks he made a good wolverine.... he didnt. he missed the comic. GOOD ACTOR, shit as wolverine."

CmRih_VtVAs,i think i just came in my pants from the syncing in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker looks like he's wearing Halloween makeup
CmRih_VtVAs,"Could this actually be a better film then B.V.S. 
   Is this the time that Dc actually got the right actors for the right rolls?. 
It all started with Superman: Man Of Steel, now we get Batman V Superman & Suicide Squad plus Justice League 2017."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the joker remind me of Miley cyrus..
CmRih_VtVAs,WB you guys can make it r rated
CmRih_VtVAs,what a fantastic trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,i forgot the religious fire guy's name
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my gosh Margot Robbie has never looked hotter or am I just in to crazy girls can't Waite to watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 who is this O.o
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably the best trailer EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,wait are the villains the heroes in this (the badd guys become the good guys)
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm totally obsessed
CmRih_VtVAs,+haljordan4life same
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm very excited for this movie. Looks like brilliant fun. This is the only DC movie I'm actually excited for right now. Dawn of Justice looks awful.

I feel that DC are rushing to catch up with MCU and they're going to fail as a result."
CmRih_VtVAs,;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 1:59 and you'll see that the dye from jokers and harleens clothes are the red and blue, and the form a heart around the two"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:17 Hey look kids! It's Captain Spaulding.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker jumping to the acid pool? That's what leto would call ""SHAKESPERIAN"" 🙌🏻"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker jumping to the acid pool? That's what leto would call ""SHAKESPERIAN"" 🙌🏻"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the joker ！！！His crazy side，treachery……or whatever is so attractive😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who sees the Joker here and things Till Lindemann?
CmRih_VtVAs,im just here to listen the song does anyone know whats its called
CmRih_VtVAs,It's becoming apparent now that Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang will die in the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So when I went to go see deadpool and this trailer played and some fucking dickhead said ""worst joker ever"" I wanted to do something but I am sane"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best 2 mins 30 sec of my life
CmRih_VtVAs,is that lady with the sword the same one in arrow season 3 named katana
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's more hyped for this then BvS?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a feeling that the scene with the joker surrounded by the knives and guns and such will be where enchantress does some magic and makes him the monster that is attacking everything, using all the weapons and stuff as a catalyst to ""add"" to his body or give him some form of magic infused ""armor"". Just a feeling, could be wrong and seriously hope I am."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel Fanbabies are complaining that this movie will suck due to 3-4 bad movies before it. Shall I name some bad Marvel movies? 

Fantastic Four
Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer
Fantastic Four (2015)
Spider-Man 3
The Amazing Spider-Man
The Amazing Spider-Man 2
Daredevil 
Elektra
Ghost Rider
Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance
X-Men The Last Stand

So who has some better movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason I'm watching this movie is because of Cara acting as Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker is kinda weird in this, but I think that I'll like him when I see the movie.

The biggest problem I have with him is the teeth they gave him, it seems like it messes with his speech.

But nonetheless seems like a great movie and I can't wait!"
CmRih_VtVAs,idk why people hate on jared letos joker. I love how they changed up the joker so its not the same exact joker again. The flashy colourful joker almost seems more realistic.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love marggot robie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let's be honest, this trailer wouldn't be half as epic if queen's song wasn't in it."
CmRih_VtVAs,love Harley Quinn's new look.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Let's see how fast and far you can fly, Dark Knight. This town is mine!"" - Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Best part
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait until 1:45 can you see that green stuff in the subway.That looks Like a full hd green
CmRih_VtVAs,the enchantress <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love this trailer. Very well edited and put together, and doesn't show too much of the movie."

CmRih_VtVAs,That song tho
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it me or does Harley Quinn kind of look like Anne Hathaway?
CmRih_VtVAs,what song?
CmRih_VtVAs,lets give guns and armor to the enemy..great
CmRih_VtVAs,a whant to see this movie now!!! a can't stop watching this trailer with awsome song and the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I never like to compare DC and Marvel because i like both equally but holly shit this trailer looks soooo much more awesome that Civil War
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else think the humour is really cheesy and also rip killer crocs outfit
CmRih_VtVAs,is it August yet?
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched about five times a day for the last week.. Gives me such a buzz! August feels too far away 😫
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a marvel fanboy but this shit is awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like a black ops 2 map
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think the actress who plays harley is not fitting for the charater I imagine her crazyer and with more annoying voice
just my opinion, don t hate ( you can if you want ;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,suicide squad.... freddy mercury.... this trailer is pure heaven
CmRih_VtVAs,"so whats the point of harley being in the squad? no superpowers, just crazy...thats all?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great Trailer. I can't wait.. But that whole ""we're bad guys it's what we do"" line is so painful to hear. Idk why it's just super annoying lol dammit Margot"
CmRih_VtVAs,this violence and music remind me A Clockwork Orange
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm addicted to this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is the movie only 57min long?
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone know what is the song of this advertise
CmRih_VtVAs,"Its going to be a good year for me :D Superman v Batman, Civil War, TMNT, and FRICKING SUICIDE SQUAD! Soooooo excited!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great cast
CmRih_VtVAs,Waiting!....
CmRih_VtVAs,I love when when trailer sound effects line up with the music so good.
CmRih_VtVAs,no one liked hulk anyways... 😅

D.C.:Batman vs. Superman(HELL FUCKING YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Suicide Squad(_____/\____/\______/\_/\_/\/\//////______________)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling Joker jumped in an Ace chemical vat to save Harley. Talk about flashbacks.
CmRih_VtVAs,I already nominate Margot Robbie as best leading actress
CmRih_VtVAs,Its come to the point where its a religion to watch this everyday for me.

CmRih_VtVAs,I want to know the harlys voices really said in her head
CmRih_VtVAs,maybe when it says too late my time has come maybe it meant that dead shots time has come to fight them and when it said shivers down my side that means that the fire guy gets shivers when he falls in the water anyone agree
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the black woman Amanda Waller from Justice League?
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool new trailer for Alice Through The Looking Glass. But the white queen looks a little different.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker gets faggier and faggier as the premiere gets closer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Haters please go fuck yourselves
CmRih_VtVAs,guys run before the scene kids takeover

CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a marvel fan but this movie looks epic! Definitely gonna go see it!

EDIT: 7/1/2018 This movie sucked and the only good part was the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody was in the trailer for the film. Marvel >>>>>> DC"
CmRih_VtVAs,In speed 0.5 Harley quinn sounds like a drunk hahaha !!
CmRih_VtVAs,It's too bad Tara Strong never went in into live-Acting (other than Sabrina) she would've made a great Harley. Not that Margot can't pull it off.
CmRih_VtVAs,varey lik

CmRih_VtVAs,0:07 sounds like the voice of angry grandpa
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker isnt actually that bad from what we saw in the picture

haha "" cant wait to show u my toys"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Does somebody else thinks this is godamm creepy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Trailers ruin all action scenes...seen it before, bet itll be the same with this one. They just dont care dont they??"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have seen Deadpool... AWESOME movie! But this movie... Will be EPIC!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Really Want This To Be Rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sophisticated Woman in The Wolf of Wall Street opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, ditto in Focus opposite Will Smith, and now crazy Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad. Look out world, here comes Margot !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Warner Borthers trying to trick me into getting excited for this joker by putting Queen in the trailer.. nice try guys...

CmRih_VtVAs,Song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how this movie is gonna be dark but its got a lot of colors in it. I really like that! It all just looks beatiful
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how the walking talking stereotype of an Australian only drinks beer in this
CmRih_VtVAs,the good thing about the suicide squad is that when they make stupid choices it wont be their fault since they're used to being evil
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song called
CmRih_VtVAs,I cannot WAIT TO SEE THIS! Leto as the Joker is gonna be amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,"sad when you hate batman and can't stand the movies, but love The Joker and Harley Quinn."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The song choose for the trailer was greeeeat. I'm excited for Harley Quinn's craziness. After all,the world needs more crazy."
CmRih_VtVAs,All sings point to a HARD R. So please..... Please I promise I'll see it twice
CmRih_VtVAs,The Jared Leto joker looks better but the Heath ledger joker had a better personality
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just noticed in some shots Harley has the collar and others she doesn't.

And most of the squad are not shown with a collar at all. Interesting."
CmRih_VtVAs,CMON LETS HIT THAT 40MILLION VIEW COUNT!!

CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn ❤

CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be pg-13
CmRih_VtVAs,I still think the dude that explode the subway is Undercover Groot with Superpowers 👌 (and the dude with the fist is Undercover Dick Grayson)  😂😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like both Marvel, and DC. That being said. DC has a far better villain roster. That's why this movie is going to be the SHIT!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn seems so forced to me here. It's like i'm watching bad anime again.
CmRih_VtVAs,Still wish will smith wasn't dead shot and croc was bigger. Still going to enjoy this film though.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I remember the day this trailer came out.Earlier,I was talking to a friend of mine""Still not sure about Suicide Squad,man.""
Then I saw this.Immediately called him""We're doing this,"""
CmRih_VtVAs,scott eastwood is in this movie! 0:55 lol he from taylor swift wildest dreams

CmRih_VtVAs,i have watched this trailer a 100 times...the movie will come out in august..mhm..shit i have to watch this a few more times
CmRih_VtVAs,"How can this movie look so good when Batman v. Superman looks so shitty?! You are tearing me apart, DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,If only this was Rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey wasnt will smith whinning about the oscars being too white? And now he plays a anti-hero who was white in the comic?Just imagine the roles reversed, hypocrites somehow...."

CmRih_VtVAs,OMG HARLEY QUIN OMG I LOVE HER
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really wanted to watch this film first time I saw the trailer but over the last week I've become obsessed with 30 seconds to mars, in particular Jared Leto, and now I am counting down the days until the film comes out, super excited"
CmRih_VtVAs,the only thing that isn't total bullshit in this trailer is the music
CmRih_VtVAs,THE MOST COLORFUL MOVIE TRAILER I'VE EVER SEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,Хороший трейлер! Но каким же будет фильм?
CmRih_VtVAs,"deadpool, suicide squad, civil war and dawn of justice are all coming out!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else expecting to see them all head banging in a car?
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn all this time I was thinking Cara is going to be Harley Quinn...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ever since Guardians came out, almost every movie trailer are doing these retro music intro. Anyway, can't wait for this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone please tell me that's joker in the trailer

CmRih_VtVAs,"so fucking hyped, this trailer is awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,this has to be one of the most beautiful and colorful dark and gritty looking movies I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"did you realize that in some scenes,harley doesn't have the ""puddin""necklace?"
CmRih_VtVAs,The comic con trailer was so much better than this one
CmRih_VtVAs,I just came here because of the comments ln Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody official video saying they heard that song in Suicide Squad official trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,WBLPDE BLASTER LENGKAP{
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm quite eager to see Jared Leto's portrayal of Joker. I honestly can't fuckn wait for this to drop!!! so excited!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my new addiction in life
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is the Harley accent? :(
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is good but it was the worst heroes i ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 the year of the good bad guys.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen : princes of the universe "" fit better for this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,I mean.... I just can't wait until august
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys! It's what we do.""  That line just made my day.

I also love how they have yet to show a single hint of who the villian is, because for some reason I can't see Joker as the villian (Harley Quinn)."
CmRih_VtVAs,Well I was excited about this... Until I saw Will Smith was in it. Fucking crybaby.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I've watched this trailer 39 times.
CmRih_VtVAs,i am so FUCKING READY
CmRih_VtVAs,Well that looks a hell of a lot better than the promo pictures.
CmRih_VtVAs,What's this song called
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody just did it for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i think it's not a match backsong, just saying"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one cringing hard at Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i really really need to watch this movie, the problem is we still have a few months left, which is really really BAD!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,so is jokey the bad hahahaa joke nation
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like a bad cunt !!! can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemia rapsodi
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear if they kill Harley Quinn...
CmRih_VtVAs,OPEN THE GATE!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Reminds me of the film ""Smokin' Aces"".  Completely out of control! The Joker: [giggling] ""I don't, I don't want to kill you! What would I do without you? Go back to ripping off mob dealers? No, no, NO! No. You... you... complete me."""
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that the hype will ruin the movie for some people...
CmRih_VtVAs,"should have used ""dont stop me now."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, Jared Leto looks like he'll play a great joker, no problem with him. But thank god he wears a shirt, because whoever thought he'd look good without one was just wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,Man this song matched this movie perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,hate that it comes out in August. it's making me wish August come sooner but I don't want it to cause school starts in August :/
CmRih_VtVAs,This too shall pass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whats wrong with you Harley, by your fault I now have a strange stressed in my low parts."
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,god they finally did it... one song for a whole trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,Really want to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhepsody i love you song
CmRih_VtVAs,I still wish this was R rated. Could have been 10000 times better than it already is
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love the fact people put DC down no matter what.

""Batman v Superman looks like shit compared to Suicide Squad""

You might as well say, DC is better than DC."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dude I just saw Solomon Grundy
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,what is this song
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh I love Harley I would just crash that wind and take that bag
CmRih_VtVAs,Rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Jobe from The Lawnmower Man?
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeeeeay i like this trailer.I♥️suicide squad ♦️♠️♣️🃏
CmRih_VtVAs,The Queen music doesn't work AT ALL.  This trailer really turns me off.  Not excited to see this movie at all now.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song plz ?
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer I've ever seen in my life
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone feel like they should be seeing this movie in IMAX 3D
CmRih_VtVAs,waitin for sucide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,THATS HOW YOU USE A SONG IN A TRAILER FUCKING AWSOME!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh... My... God... It's the best!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm obsessed with this trailer, need help"
CmRih_VtVAs,"yo, the Mr Croc is sooo tiny"
CmRih_VtVAs,If DC pulls this off...... REST IN PEACE Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,I really scream when I heard queen's song
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys it's what we do"" Going to quote this for a long time"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Crap,,,,,,first ben afleck as batman and now will Smith. I just know im gonna be thinking about the theme song from fresh Prince of bel air now throu the whole damn movie an d for the first time ever be om supermans side to beat the hell out of the guy in the batman outfit. The movie looks amazing but goddamn it why will Smith? Why not another actor you could believe as a killer. Hope im wrong and the movie is gonna be awesome but I feel a heartbreaking disappointment here."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think the good part starts from 1:04 and ends at 2:14
CmRih_VtVAs,"I personally think Jim carry was much better a choice for joker than whoever this guy is 
I can’t wait to show you my toys"
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST IS TOO LONG I NEED IT NOW!!! TmT
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer looks amazing but it's not the kind of movie I'd want to see.
I love how DC is making a lighter movie for once though."
CmRih_VtVAs,I´m not the one who gets hyped that early in general but i think this is the BEST FUCKN TRAILER I`VE EVAAAA SEEN !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,seriously if i can burn people like that joker would die in less a minute
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer I have seen in a while...
CmRih_VtVAs,is that girl harley quinn goddamn she is hot
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen  brought me here :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto's Joker has a really good maniacal laughter
CmRih_VtVAs,I think they're a group of villains. Why would they become heroes?
CmRih_VtVAs,Great soundtrack :)
CmRih_VtVAs,looks over the top
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared letos joker seems to be pretty good but he still looks stupid with the grill and fucking tattoos. killer croc looks stupid as fuck too
CmRih_VtVAs,no se ve tan interesante como que se ve muy boba ...
CmRih_VtVAs,I STILL CRY
CmRih_VtVAs,CRYING
CmRih_VtVAs,"so is captain boomerang jai courtney or tom hardy because they both look mega alike lolol. either way, this movie looks freaking bomb"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,I like it. I want it. But I know they're gonna ruin it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"besides Jared Leto, I doubt if this will live up to it's hype.  Hope they prove me wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,i hope that the person that designed the jokers appeareance gets fired.
CmRih_VtVAs,There's a more serious intent with this film and it's actors who participated in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,38 MIL VIEWSSS????? 😱
CmRih_VtVAs,"Calling it right now, this'll be one of the biggest critical and financial disasters of 2016. It'll be right up here with Gods of Egypt as a huge dud."
CmRih_VtVAs,I did!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie and Deadpool are going to be the best of 2016!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys I heard Jared Leto brushed his teeth then immediately drank orange juice, I'm honesty getting scared, where does Leto begin and the Joker end?!?!!!?!??"
CmRih_VtVAs,"it looked good until the title screen,  what is that shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've play Bohemian Rapsody so much in GH that i got tired of this song, and now it appears to be everywhere .-."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else sees and hears Jeannette Voerman in Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Great Music.. It Matches so (Bad) !!! .  Awesome Trailer !!!!   Can't Wait for August !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,just when we thought there wont be more insane joker :)

CmRih_VtVAs,Meet the Deadpool of DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is going to steal every scene in this entire movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,They let Harley Quinn and the Joker have hair dye in jail?
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so watching this on its opening day!
CmRih_VtVAs,Love this DC/Marvel pissin contest!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll be  waiting for this movie just to see my love 😘🙆🏼 Harley Quinn..
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like a War Boy from Mad Max.
CmRih_VtVAs,is that Harley Quinn in that movie ! I saw the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that is really not happy with Jared Leto playing the Joker? Just me?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I looked it up, it sez they are aiming for pg-13 so it fits with other dc movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a Marvel guy, this looks astounding! It actually looks fun! Probably because the characters are having fun. If we take superheroes to seriously (not that we never should), we become angsty, annoying and nonsensical. Basically, Kent's father. Man of steel was nice, but DAMN it people lighten up!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Esse filme vai ser FO DA

CmRih_VtVAs,They ruined the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the kind of comic book movie that would really need the R-Rating ... too bad they aimed for PG-13. If only Deadpool would have come out earlier
CmRih_VtVAs,"10,725 dislike joker can wait to kill you like toyss!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not much into comic book nerd rivalries but man DC coming back with a vengeance with Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman this year. Civil War looks cool too tho.

CmRih_VtVAs,queeeeeen and suicide squad <3 what more can we ask for ?!?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,This was more like a final trailer...I bet between now and August we'll see the whole film through tv-spots and a whole slew of internationals

CmRih_VtVAs,pffft...maaan...hope this is better then kick ass 2 was

CmRih_VtVAs,marvel fan here....Can't fucking wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Does anyone know if they would've considered Heath Ledger for the role of Joker in this had he still been alive? I know that this movie isn't affiliated with Christopher Nolan's trilogy, but I cant help but wonder if he would've been good for this Joker or not. What do you guys think?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad & GOTG > Justice League & Avengers

CmRih_VtVAs,"This is wonderful, but Deadpool can bet about the ""worst heroes"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still bugs me that Margot isn't doing the Brooklyn accent, we know she can do it perfectly, but she did no research. Proves the people making these films don't care about the source material or someone would have pointed it out."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is definitely my favorite movie trailer.

CmRih_VtVAs,Tryhard to the MAX
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker wants anarchy on the streets. He wants to draw out his favorite adversary, ""Batman"", for conflict and amusement.. His intent is to corrupt, control and destroy Gotham when freed from his prison. Harley Quinn is a student of the Joker and slowly follows in his anarchistic footsteps. She needs to be more like the Joker in this film. Diabolical. The rest want to go about their ways before they were incarcerated. Just some ideas. :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg! Bohemian rhapsody! Fits perfectly! Best trailer ever imo
CmRih_VtVAs,Help with the song wich version of bohemian rhapsody is?

CmRih_VtVAs,"a new generation of scene kids begins. oh god, help us"
CmRih_VtVAs,"After seeing Deadpool, WB really missed out on a good opportunity with this. This movie would have most definitely benefitted from an R-rating, and instead it's going to be a watered down, PG-13 ""family movie"". I don't understand why studios still think everything needs to be for kids, but hopefully after his movie bombs, studios will finally stop trying to make everything PG-13."
CmRih_VtVAs,New Joker = Shit
CmRih_VtVAs,This is like the 100th time I've watched this lol!

CmRih_VtVAs,"I like how 99.9% of people had/have no idea who these obscure comic book characters are but have been so mind fucked by disney's marketing machine into becoming experts who converse  on this or that detail anyhow.  Like when the ufc hype was in full effect everyone was able to discuss ""ground game"" and other obscure concepts like it was second nature."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love IT ❤
CmRih_VtVAs,😍😍😍😍

Literally obsessed w Harley Quinn ;_;"
CmRih_VtVAs,I smiled the first time i saw this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 DAT ASS WOW
CmRih_VtVAs,"More excited for this than BVS! Also, Jai Courtney actually looks good so far from what I've seen!"
CmRih_VtVAs,All aboard the fucking hype train!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Would be really awesome if they made an Addams Family trailer like this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks amazing but I remain unconvinced with the Joker, It doesn't seem like the crazy ass clown from the comics. Waiting for the movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg freakin awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"I already saw Deadpool, now I'm ready for Batman v. Superman, then Captain America: Civil War, X-Men: Apocalypse, and now I'll see this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait so is Enchantress in the suicide squad? And whos is the japanese girl with the sword? She seems important but they didn't really say anything about her...
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol the most anticipated movies about superheroes are Batman v Superman, Deadpool, Captain America Civil War and this xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,queen is the best... hardcore henry and suicide squad.. perfection.
CmRih_VtVAs,the credits are soo colorful
CmRih_VtVAs,Agreed.
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanted to cry when I heard joker laughing on the floor. leto I fucking salute you!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know if you guy  noticed the suicide squad poster the joker is holding a stick similar to robin http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/dcmovies/images/2/2a/Suicide_Squad_Team_Poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160119223645
CmRih_VtVAs,Why oh why did they put Harley in booty shorts?
CmRih_VtVAs,damn how long do ive to wait for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,I watch this like 3937 times
CmRih_VtVAs,Most disgusting version of the joker I have ever seen and I'm not talking about the acting.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love on how their first instinct when they are released is to punch the person nearest to them
CmRih_VtVAs,did I just see death stroke?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley does not seem as childlike as her character normally is.
Hope she's more in character when I see the movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The bohemian rhapsody linked in perfectly with the events of the trailer I almost forgot how much I love that song
CmRih_VtVAs,what queen song is that?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is what a good fucking trailer is supposed to be: you see things, you just don't understand what happen, and you like it, plus you wanna see the movie. Not like the second trailer of BvS where you basically understand the whole story and you're like ""well it'll be broadcast on TV one day"".
And also, nice to see Will Smith in a good role."
CmRih_VtVAs,groot?
CmRih_VtVAs,This and Hardcore Henry are the best trailer with the best used of Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,do people know that suicide squad is in the arrow tv series
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me everyone in the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Me while watching this trailer... WHY IS QUEEN STILL ON!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks good, wanna see dcs take on something more silly, kinda like marvel"
CmRih_VtVAs,I already love the panda
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who wanted a Black&Red Harley instead of the Blue&Red one? It goes more with the arkham harley origins theme for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:49 Are we going to ignore that syncing?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto will make a great joker I think. A bit more psycho :)
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is full of life
CmRih_VtVAs,all aboard the HYPE TRAIN!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,"The reasons why i love this trailer:

1. fucking Queen!
2 2:07"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do marvel fanboys have to hate on this vid? D:
CmRih_VtVAs,green hair gaspher
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:34 Well, where's El Diablo's tongue? O__o"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 is Harley's flashback of how the Joker made her into Harley Quinn. Calling it now.
CmRih_VtVAs,fresh
CmRih_VtVAs,They said if they reach 40 million views on this video they are gonna release the next trailer👍🏽
CmRih_VtVAs,Rated 5 stars +10 million
CmRih_VtVAs,talk about squad goals...this is why I shouldn't be a comedian
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS SO FUCKING INSANE CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here. Only Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,
CmRih_VtVAs,they could not have chosen a better song for this amazing trailer. SS HYPE!!
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking epic
CmRih_VtVAs,The sing choice ruined the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,watched this trailer for margot robbie and queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,With the success of that Deadpool has found. THEY HAVE TO MAKE THIS RATED R. Do the right thing Warners!
CmRih_VtVAs,Q
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this song.
CmRih_VtVAs,perfect background song
CmRih_VtVAs,Awsome
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna see this fucking movie already
CmRih_VtVAs,Which actor (bar Margaret) does Harley Quinn look like it's really bugging me
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer 2 not 1
CmRih_VtVAs,One cannot simply only watch this trailer once
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did you guys know that ""Mr Ecko"" (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) during the time he was on the island on lost he came across a swamp of talking crocodiles. They bit him and changed him into one of them. He was caught swimming back to Gotham City where he was fished up in the harbor by a fishing boat that had 30 men on board. He killed and ate them all in a violent rage. He lived in the sewers for a while until he came across bane ""Tom Hardy"" who ripped off his arms and tossed him into the sewer flow like where he threw Commissioner Gordan on the dark knight rises. He was found a few days later by the vigilante known as batman while he was searching for Gordan. Batman analysed his body and had discovered that he was involved in the murder of those 30 men on that boat so he sent him straight to Arkham Asylum. And this is where the story carries on from for killer croc"
CmRih_VtVAs,hey timmy whos your favorite super hero?That crazy one from suicide squid!W-w-what?
CmRih_VtVAs,damn I saw the deathshot ☺
CmRih_VtVAs,"Katana is a good guy, bodyguard of Rick Flag. But in 1:38 you see her eyes briefly turn black. Enchantress will possess her, or take her under her command, eventually maki g her kill Rick Flag. Killer Croc does attack her, that's what i think, and them both end up in a death-match where only the one will survive; i put my begs on Katana, Killer Croc is fast and colossal, but she has her sword, of course, unless she lost it in the sewer where the fight is."
CmRih_VtVAs,br1ll I agree but is just me or does anyone even care about the suicide squad? I just wanna see what the new joker is going to be like.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Instead of hero's I want villians fighting bad and having Deadeye,Harley Quinn, Joker,and Killer Croc (P.S. if you don't know who they are your not allowed to watch it. )"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks Harley Quinn looks so pretentious
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fucking awesome im tired of that batman,superman Shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, it's what we do..."" This kinda sums up the lowlives of this world, and some of 420000 who liked this trailer. The good thing, though, is that there are far more ""We're good guys, this is what we do..."" who fucks up lowlives for causing nothing but problems in the world."
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like all the stars in this movie gonna do well! including Jai courtney and Cara.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:39 best part!!!! I hope the movie is as good as the trailer!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow what a trailer!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Im the only one who is gonna see this movie only because Harley Queen?

CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool killed a lot pf mfs
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you watch Arrow, You'll see what the suicide squad is, their background and the people who owns them."
CmRih_VtVAs,That song is lit 🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, it's what we do."" I can feel a strong, sarcastic sass with this one."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I saw this at the theater for Deadpool, and as soon as all of us college kids heard the song, we all started singing.  It was sooo awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"420,000th like, I NEED HELP."
CmRih_VtVAs,Really didn't feel it

CmRih_VtVAs,Glad to see Will SMith is just ...being Will Smith from Bad Boys.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hears Queen song pauses video to comment sees other comments  I approve :-D
CmRih_VtVAs,"I mean.. This movie REALLLY has to be SUPER great if it wants to compete with.. THIS FUCKING TRAILER. Yeah, I think this trailer alone is gonna be better than the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC Scientists have discovered ""Humor.""  Research is being conducted"
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie would be pleased...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I literally can't stop watching this trailer, anybody else have the same problem?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think I'm gonna like this Joker, pure psycho version."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley: I don't give a fuck if I'm saving the world I still need to be Fashionable
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody makes it like 200 times better
and it fits so good :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"question, is the guy at 0:19 dj kaleed?"

CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 2:10....
Anne Hathaway.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks raw as fuck!!! Wtf is the problem??? They just turned him into a thug is all.... A super thug
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know why but I love the image of Joker jumping into the pool of chemicals or whatever they are and bringing Harley up into the surface in his hands. Looks beautiful.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, the best trailer I have ever seen"
CmRih_VtVAs,posion ivy is in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,He visto este trailer muchas veces!! jajajaja
CmRih_VtVAs,anybody else think killer croc is gonna die
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn needs film with Whirlpool !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,When I look at the joker I can't stop seeing Rayon.
CmRih_VtVAs,"should punch the ""art"" and ""costume designers"" in the face till no teeth in mouth for what they ve done with harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is in Movie! Must be *not worth to watch*.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one having a big crush on joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"When the teaser came out I was like-""Shit... DC is digging itself even deeper with this crap..."" But when this trailer dropped, I got so unbelievably hyped, that I literally can't describe it with words."
CmRih_VtVAs,jai courtney.... WORST. ACTOR. EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,not being excited by the movie is one thing but this trailer is pure art
CmRih_VtVAs,Addicted ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"who is that at 1:44
?
?
?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody with an awesome Trailer! No one can possibly dislike this trailer! Yet, 10000 dislikes! WTF is wrong with these people?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks fun, but the joker would never be a hero not even under threat i would love to see jared leto´s joker on an Batman film not as part of the suicide squad that doesnt make sense to me. just saying..."
CmRih_VtVAs,did i just see Joker save Quinn? Love is in the air !!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,is that McQueen?!?!

CmRih_VtVAs,"compared to first one, its weak. still cant wait to see it tho"

CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,You put the craziest song in the world into the craziest trailer ever. It fucking works
CmRih_VtVAs,Uploaded on my b-day 😀😀😀
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love this trailer, but I'm still unsure about a movie with this many so called dangerous criminals being PG-13. I feel like it will neuter it in some way."
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this movie does not fuck up in screenplay, well it's already on the 'classic' list."
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you're a DC fan and you think this movie is your only hope to not hate DC movies 'cause batman vs superman's trailer spoils everything, then try to watch the latest and final trailer of BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I might be wrong for saying this but wasn't Harley originally a therapist? And the Joker was originally a high billionaire by the name of Jack? Idk anymore but nice to see that Joker still cares about Harley. And is it wrong that i think their characters should have kid together. I mean how funny would that be. Part crazy and part lunatic. On a side note wow i can't believe the lead singer of 30 Seconds To Mars plays the Joker. I am just like ""hey its  Jared from 30 S.T.M."" That one guy though at 1:35-1:37. Dude is like forget this your only out once."
CmRih_VtVAs,Look's awesome. Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,The girl with the Japanese flag on her mask is from arrow on netflix

CmRih_VtVAs,MAMA MIA LET ME GO
CmRih_VtVAs,jinx !
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07
Dat ass.."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that DC has finally had enough of Marvel's success and broke into their HQ and stole the movie formula. This is the first test.
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman v superman trailer 3 was better. More hype
CmRih_VtVAs,I just hope they don't kill off killer croc
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg they used Bohemian Rhapsody ❤️😍 QUEEN✊🙌🏻👑
CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly couldn't care less if this movie does not live up to the hype. I am satisfied just watching this trailer, I cannot seem to get enough of it.  It is the best god damn trailer I have ever seen, it should win an award...for real."
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a great movie from DC. Marvel has been doing this for years.
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a great movie from DC. Marvel has been doing this for years.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto makes me want to orgasm in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,There are more comments about bohemian rhapsody playing than there are about the actual trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I guess they got rid of Harley Quinn's accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:38 Was like: Damn, these drugs kick iiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnn...*flies away in a imaginary world filled with bacon-human who all talk Klingon.*"
CmRih_VtVAs,I HATE THE SONG
CmRih_VtVAs,"OH, this song was on this trailer.
Well, I listens to bohemian rhapsody lately, and the comment section are talking about Suicide Squad, and im so confused bc i just watched the first look lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER AND MOVIE EVR!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What song
CmRih_VtVAs,Watched this 100 times from how this trailer fits with bohemian rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Do you think if Heath Ledger was still alive, they would have cast him instead if Leto?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this trailer this is the best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wooooow, is so perfect this squad ❤"
CmRih_VtVAs,best movie ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,my husband watches this and the trailer for batmas VS superman every day. no joke
CmRih_VtVAs,my husband watches this and the trailer for batmas VS superman every day. no joke
CmRih_VtVAs,The no-eyebrows joker sucks +9000 worst joker impersonation EVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,The no-eyebrows joker sucks +9000 worst joker impersonation EVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,i wanna nut in margrot robbies ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know how many times I've seen the trailer, but I can't resist to watch it again"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who's that guy who splits the subway in half at 1:44?
I don't recognize him."
CmRih_VtVAs,I watch this trailer everyday like  something new is going to pop up lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's ready to the toy's!!
CmRih_VtVAs,a dark movie or a comedy movie !!??!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Caesar Romero's Joker was just a foolish clown. 
Jack Nicholson's was more of a crime lord, a sociopath if you want. 
Heath Ledger's was more ruthless and serious in his business (and the most brilliant).But the Leto version of the Joker is more cruel and sadistic than the others, a homicidical psychopath who enjoys torture. More of the Batman: Dark Knight Returns type, who can become angry and very very scary."
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't think I've ever watched a trailer so much on repeat like this one.  Fucking phenomenal.
CmRih_VtVAs,What they do to the Joker ? That´s not even Joker what the fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,bets are on: what shot from the trailer won't make it into the final cut?
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like queen....
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody is all I need
CmRih_VtVAs,came here after watching bvs trailer 3 dc is really  killing it
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else was brought here by bohemian rhapsody song??
CmRih_VtVAs,Who the hell is the guy that punches that other guy at 0:40
CmRih_VtVAs,I have to be honest. I wasn't hyped for this movie until I saw this trailer! The music makes it x10 better!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Really excited for this movie..but

..i really miss the old joker :'("
CmRih_VtVAs,i like superhero movies in which heroes won't have superpowers more like V for Vendetta and Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, Suicide Squad Pg13?That is ridiculous! THEY ARE VILLAINS! Joker want supposed to have any limits. Instead DC Cartoons are more adult than the live action movies. Fucking sad man. Finding out SS is pg13, me and my group of 20 will wait for red box! So disappointed! Being outdone by Marvels Deadpool. DC should be ashamed!"
CmRih_VtVAs,and slade wilson..
CmRih_VtVAs,who is that witch chick?

CmRih_VtVAs,Lemme see hmmm Deadpool or this
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it R Rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,So excited! can't wait💕🙌
CmRih_VtVAs,the only thing I don't like about the movie is how the joker looks
CmRih_VtVAs,So looking forward to see how Deadshot and Cpt. Boomerang will be portrayed.
CmRih_VtVAs,😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks really. Really. Stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,Imagine how awesome this movie would be with heath ledger as joker :/
CmRih_VtVAs,Those 10000 dislikes are the Marvel fans that know that were taking back our crown
CmRih_VtVAs,Squad goals.
CmRih_VtVAs,It has been giving too much of sneak peaks. I wished it's an 2hour episode. 😑
CmRih_VtVAs,It has been giving too much of sneak peaks. I wished it's an 2hour episode. 😑
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not that I complain, but why is Quinn in every second frame in this video?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is how you advertise a move.
None of that ""Jared got PTSD playing the joker"" EDGY EDGY 2 EDGY 4 U shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,well this looks like a trashy cheese fest pile a shite
CmRih_VtVAs,i did NOT expect bohemian rhapsody to be played
CmRih_VtVAs,people who disliked this are fkn queer
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does killer croc strangle katana??
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing how Suicide Squad gets more views than Batman vs. Superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,imagine tom hardy in this trailer ..
CmRih_VtVAs,Adam Beach
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, there u go. Margot is making me watch this again. I'll watch any movie which has Margot Robbie in it <3 
Hottest girl on planet"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't believe they left off King Shark.
CmRih_VtVAs,I've got the feeling this will make more money than Batman V Superman but it probably wont.
CmRih_VtVAs,Good
CmRih_VtVAs,yo sólo vine por Bohemian Rapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,so who ís a bad guy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot robbie is hot asf
CmRih_VtVAs,"10.000 dislikes?! Seriously, tha hell is wrong with you people..."
CmRih_VtVAs,the reason to watch Suicide Squad = Jared Leto's Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 Looks a lot like a Die Antwoord background
CmRih_VtVAs,"Has anyone noticed ""Puddin"" written on Harley's golden necklace? ✌🏻️😎"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I once told myself I didn't want to watch this movie.

Now I want to watch this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"These are now my favorite ""heros""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoa! Jacksepticeye is playing as Joker! Who would have thought?
CmRih_VtVAs,i think i jizzed:(
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone knows the song???
CmRih_VtVAs,So fucking AWSOME !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't forget that the suicide squad used to be a military group that fought dinosaurs from space. Warner Bros should mention this in their origin for task force x.
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever did this trailer needs to make one for Batman Vs superman because whoever is doing the current BVS trailers is hot garbage.
CmRih_VtVAs,Mama Mia mama Mia mama Mia let me go🎼🎤🎹🎬Nothing really matter to me😔😢
CmRih_VtVAs,"10, 478 people got offed by the Suicide Squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I must say it's nice to hear oldschool art rock in this trailer.  Perfect. 

The cage that Harley is swinging in, is identical to the ones, and may *BE* one of the ones, used to illegally imprison G20 protesters in Toronto in ""Torontonamo Bay"".  That's perfect too.  Like, Amanda Waller was running the Toronto cops that day."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Apparently they now have therapists on set for the suicide squad actors to make sure they dont follow the road their character is playing. It's not proven, but lots of people speculate Heath ledger killed himself because of the role of playing ""the joker"". That's why just to make sure, Warner bros have hired therapists to make sure nothing happens again!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto as the Joker gives me life.
CmRih_VtVAs,"great trailer, mose excited ive been for a dc movie in a while"
CmRih_VtVAs,if the trailer ta well imagine the film
CmRih_VtVAs,this film and fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks horrendous.
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody is a classic and one of my favorites!
CmRih_VtVAs,I just got over my addiction to Queen. Then I saw this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley doesn't have her brooklin accent. I mean that's totally fine decision to make but it just feels kinda imperfect to me that they went with that for her character. Still excited for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad > Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,i watch this trailer to see cara delevingne <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Ahh it's gonna be a great year

CmRih_VtVAs,eeeeewwwwwwww!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker sounds like aids
CmRih_VtVAs,i swear to god if this is another messed up dc movie boyo boy
CmRih_VtVAs,"This came on before a Deadpool showing I went to today (awesome movie btw, go check it out if you haven't already, *no spoilers* if you're replying to this about it) and this trailer looks even better in the cinema. Can't wait to see it there in August."
CmRih_VtVAs,"are was a DC vs Marvel comic in the comics, last time i checked"
CmRih_VtVAs,I need to stop watching this but I'm so excited to see it!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the Joker a part of the squad or not?
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MY GOFJSLDK
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Deathstroke in this?  One of the guys looked heavily armored.
CmRih_VtVAs,I got a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe from that music. Looks like a sick movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,when queen starts playing and you start crying immediately
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it ✨
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 thank me later
CmRih_VtVAs,this look interestin af
CmRih_VtVAs,enchantress's costume is sexist bullshit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:31, Katana with the soul-sword and somg in background. Perfect"
CmRih_VtVAs,"10,000 dislikes???  STAN LEE'S HERE! MARVEL-FAN ALERT! CALL THE JUSTICE LEAGUE, THE AVENGERS' GONE BAD!"
CmRih_VtVAs,100% going to watch this for Will Smith the man!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm guessing the ""thing"" at 1:44 (also briefly seen at 1:51 and responsible for the destruction at 1:06) will be the villain that the Suicide Squad will be tasked to go after? Is this an existing villain from the comic books?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This was a great trailer, but damn if Jared Leto's Joker was the ugliest looking live action Joker I have ever seen (and not in a good way)."
CmRih_VtVAs,New Batman vs Superman trailer kicks ass!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith finally in something with balls. Omg this looks awesome can't wait!!!
If this ends with some kind of God laced twist i will never forgive you Will!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"What I like about this trailer is that it's as if someone at Warner Bros./DC asked, ""...um, yeah, can we have fun again?"" Then Warner Bros. said, ""No! You have to do it our way!"" Then this person went, ""Yeah, screw it. GO NUTS, EVERYONE!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,The red and blue makes a heart. at 1:58 with Harley and the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith loading a gun in time to Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the most gloriously epic things I've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,
CmRih_VtVAs,Yoi
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sure Leto is going to be very good as the Joker. But not as good as Heath Ledger.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can'th waith to shhowh you my toysh
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's amazing how well Queen, one amazing song works with these collection of clips. But be reminded that we have no idea what the soundtrack for this is. So exciting! But put your pants back on for a bit."
CmRih_VtVAs,the like/dislike ratio....
CmRih_VtVAs,The new joker needs to see a dentist
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who things this looks shit? the style for the characters just really don't fit i mean Joker looks like some fucking junkie
CmRih_VtVAs,With these movies being multi-million/billion dollar projects how are comics still just geeky nerd books?
CmRih_VtVAs,How the EFF does this gave 10 thousand dislikes!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing trailer cant wait for the movie!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,*spoiler alert* Brainiac spotted at 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im addicted to this Trailer!! I cant fucking wait, I might die! I mean 'August'? Really?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"the crazy girl can be jinx from league of legends, if they ever make a movie for that tho."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Admit it, you have to watch more than once."
CmRih_VtVAs,they better make a solo deathstroke movie he's best badass in DC Univrse
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot robbie is a strange one. She hasn't got the biggest tits, she hasn't got much of an ass yet she's still incredibly hot."
CmRih_VtVAs,I am in love :D
CmRih_VtVAs,millionth time and i cant get enough
CmRih_VtVAs,I dunno..... Harley doesn't really seem like Harley without the accent.....
CmRih_VtVAs,I want it now.

CmRih_VtVAs,Help! Tips to stay cool until august?!  :/
CmRih_VtVAs,is 1:59 is that supposed to be the Lazarus pit
CmRih_VtVAs,I sooooo ❤ this trailer! I might spend my money 💰 two or three times on this movie 🎥 if it's super vicious!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:28 epic
CmRih_VtVAs,I need help too I watch this shit every day I just can't stop
CmRih_VtVAs,Watched this 100 times and I just noticed WHERES THE JOKERS SCARS!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like crap
CmRih_VtVAs,Estoy esperando con muchas ganas la pelicula
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be good
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks so much better than Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,So much goosebumps
CmRih_VtVAs,LOOOOOOVE HARLEY QUIN
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is on suicide watch. That doesn't looks like is going to be a good DC movie at all.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my new Watchmen.
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,doesn't look that cool to me.
CmRih_VtVAs,please subscribe to my channel I just started!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
CmRih_VtVAs,wow Dc I'm impressed by you Ive enjoyed all the shows and movies but this one has gotten my attention I loved Dc since I was a kid svsb is gonna be garbage but this is gonna be bad ass p.s. marvels better
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait for this to hit the $5 bin at Walmart, I'll be first in line, Abe-back in hand."
CmRih_VtVAs,"And now everyone will go to Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" video to comment that this trailer sent them here as if it never existed before now."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dam Did you seen the Vaydor?(the super car).
CmRih_VtVAs,I serious can't wait any longer
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone who subs to me gets a sub back u can unsub if i dont@@@
CmRih_VtVAs,Very shit
CmRih_VtVAs,I may have screamed as soon as the music of Queen started singing. This was absolutely perfect. Jesus.
CmRih_VtVAs,なんてこったい
CmRih_VtVAs,MAMA MIA MAMA MIA YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME GO!!!1
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this trailer! It's just waaay too perfect *_*
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuchsia
CmRih_VtVAs,The shells hitting the floor syncing up to the beat of the song = 11 out of 10 amazingness.
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA DELEVINGNE IS IN IT OH MY <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Excited to see, don't get me wrong. The only thing I'm worried about is that this movie will miss the point. They aren't just ""bad guys"" they're villains. DC shouldn't try to make them into the Guardians of the Galaxy by telling a story of crooked and crazy, but in a fun way, criminals that get the chance to be heroes let them be evil just fighting other evil guys. I mean Killer Croc is a damn cannibal! Any jokes from him are going to fall flat for me based on that principal alone."
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith is in it that ruined it for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,02:00....aaawwwesooommeee
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel is better

CmRih_VtVAs,the worst heroes ever have the best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,omg alex meraz as a swat or something
CmRih_VtVAs,No words... NO WORDS can describe how keen I am right now
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever! That song and movie was made for each other. Genius!
CmRih_VtVAs,Undertale wasn't that fun
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK'N AWESOME JARED !
CmRih_VtVAs,"i'll kill everyone who is asking for the startersong, really!"

CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah no. This looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,The editor of this trailer is so damn good! Im more excited to the next trailer than the movie but i still love also to watch. 👍🏻😁
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who like this Joker here???
CmRih_VtVAs,Im the only one who saw this trailer 1 million times? THE ONLY ONE?
CmRih_VtVAs,I know u excited when u know the dialogue for the whole trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can someone tell me who the chick with the sword is?
doesn't seem like they introduced her and I'm curious. 
Also, I acknowledge the fact that I'm a DC and Marvel noob."
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank you for introducing me this song. I cannot stop listening to it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"in one of the trailers there is a scene where you can see batman on top of a car. 
Is he going to be there in the movie ? Also is this in the same timeline as the batman vs superman ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like he's off just doing whatever.
CmRih_VtVAs,I remember seeing a skit that was the insperation for this movie and it had one of the exact same clips love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"I should start using Harley as my everyday excuse.

""Huh? I should knock out my boss with a baseball bat? Oh sorry....the voices."""

CmRih_VtVAs,why does harley quinn seem like a nice person in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,The gay singer goes perfect with this gay movie !
CmRih_VtVAs,This is on the day before my birthday and I have heard so much rumor about the movie itselfI had to see! The trailer looks great and putting Will Smith cast in this movie? Thats just a hell to the yes. It looked amazing already but it can't get any better
CmRih_VtVAs,All the characters look so interesting I seriously can't wait omg
CmRih_VtVAs,"The more I see of Jared Leto as Joker. the more he reminds me of a cheap Mark Hamill impression, which I am totally ok with"
CmRih_VtVAs,Show more people good music plz this is fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever thought to put Bohemian Rhapsody in this trailer should be given a raise. It fits perfectly!
CmRih_VtVAs,heath ledger was the best joker ever
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks badass
CmRih_VtVAs,"These days, when I feel down, I watch this trailer and say to my self that there's a life worth to wait for this August. And it cheered me up 😁"
CmRih_VtVAs,Scott Eastwood is at 0:55 if im not mistaken .. isn't there a rumour of him playing NightWing
CmRih_VtVAs,no puedo esperar a ver ya la película!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie it's so perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,"The way they used the music in this trailer was perfect! 

""Here's the deal, You're going somewhere very bad, to do something that will get you killed"" 

Geez he makes it sounds as if they going to hell or something LMAO"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 When you try to lowkey pregame some Four Loko before getting on line for the club
CmRih_VtVAs,this just made batman v superman less entertaining
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh no
harley's accent

CmRih_VtVAs,La payasa esta muy buena 7u7
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how Harley says""We're bad guys, Its what we do"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker worse than I've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,I really want to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,I like that when the Joker pulls Harley out of the vat tank there is a warped heart around them.
CmRih_VtVAs,Vibes no marvel trailer can make you get...
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope I live long to see this and Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer of 2016 hands down!
CmRih_VtVAs,"God, i love Harley Quinn.
I am so excited for this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why people are bagging on slipknot, that guy is in the squad for a reason, I mean he hangs people for living, that's pretty bad ass if you ask me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey guys wanna here a racist joke? 








African American acceptance."
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, this shit it's a weird X-Men movie (with a cheap Joker from Batman: 1:20 a Saiyajin: 1:48 and Bubbles, from Powerpuff Girls, in drugs 2:10)?"
CmRih_VtVAs,and thats how you make a trailer :>
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie looks like crap
CmRih_VtVAs,"What is the Joker supposed to be feeling in this scene?
Oh, right, damaged. Good thing that tattoo is there."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker looks like Freddie Mercury .-. My god
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for dis
CmRih_VtVAs,That Swedish accent though.
CmRih_VtVAs,I cannot wait until this comes out
CmRih_VtVAs,"I realised that I have a problem, I LIKE VILLAINS!! Especially villains in movie trailers with AWESOME Queen Music!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"@Miroslav S Dude they open months apart, enough time in between to watch both..."
CmRih_VtVAs,@The Brick Baron Yeah she's the Enchantress.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did I see Cara Delivigne?

CmRih_VtVAs,"10,350 dislikes were from MCU bum boys..."
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone know who the villain is?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will smith soes nit really fit in a superhero movie

CmRih_VtVAs,is this going to be like the assault on arkam movie or something different
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the c any girls hair
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:39 .. Turned me on..  Margot just nailed it I guess but still not happy with Harley Quinn's voice. When I saw first trailer thought its waste of time. I am gonna watch this no matter what, hope they don't screw up good characters..Come on DC .."
CmRih_VtVAs,a
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait for this movie!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I just know how it going to go.  Joker is going to act stupid so that everyone underestimates him.  Then He plants bombs everywhere to blow up the city. He does shit like that all the time.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey guys, there's a new script that improves audio quallity on
videos,It makes me feel like i'm in a club lol,this stuff is
insane, *if anyone interested in trying out, The link is in the comment below*"

2) Bohemian Rhapsody
3)??????

I wonder which will be the Song for the next Trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why weren't there more scenes of the katana girl? Or the guy with the braided hair? Or the guy with the boomerang? I guess they're gonna die.
CmRih_VtVAs,My two highly anticipated movies of 2016 are Dr. Strange and Suicide Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,SO COOL! Joker Fan Here!
CmRih_VtVAs,enchantress 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,i keep rewatching this. is that bad? hahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,"This does not look very good, to be honest."
CmRih_VtVAs,I marvel fans. And I love this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've lost count of the amount of times I've watched this. Tried to show some friends at school only to find that its blocked on my school internet. After that I tried to send a link to them before they asked me ""Are you sending it?"" to which I replied with ""Oh, sorry, I'm just watching it...again,"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Wtf is with the music? Doesn't fit at all... O.o
CmRih_VtVAs,good thing they added the guitar solo from the song.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's probably just people trolling but I am DEEPLY saddened by the amount of comments asking for the name of the song used in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,D-108 is my home room just thought you should know.
CmRih_VtVAs,6 Months!!!! Fuck yeah!!!!! :D :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,When people come out of the movie theatres when this is out they are all going to act like they are in the movie I prob will

CmRih_VtVAs,R.I.P Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"shoot people

CmRih_VtVAs,Can you release it already
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry, don't crucify me, but is Joker going to have be the main Antagonist in this movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:50 - 2:05  omfg sooo good
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Such an awesome trailer.  Good job WB
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer screams ""Look, we have an old timey song in our trailer! We're just like Guardians of the Galaxy!"" This looks like shit. I wish I could get hyped for a DC movie but they all look terrible, and that sucks because Im way more of a DC fan than a Marvel fan."
CmRih_VtVAs,"A guy that throws boomerangs (captian boomerang) is in the same facility as harley quinn, killer croc, someone possesed by a witch, and the greatest mercenary that never misses his target. good job planner.

(No im not talking about the director or anyone, I know suicide squad is a comic, I just allways found that factor absurd.)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looked cool until I saw Joker, ugh"
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant stop watching
CmRih_VtVAs,"I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED I'M USING THE CAPS LOCK KEY TO ENSURE I'M CONVEYING MY EXCITEMENT PROPERLY.

LETS WATCH IT ONE MORE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  >.<"
CmRih_VtVAs,"For a brief moment I thought I had seen an younger Clint Eastwood, awesome."

CmRih_VtVAs,Wrong soundtrack choice? Or is it just me?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a problem... I watch this trailer 150 times everywhere I go! and if I don't go anywhere, I watch it 300 times!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,eres muy bonita
CmRih_VtVAs,eres muy bonita
CmRih_VtVAs,So basically everyone who disliked this video was part of marvel head quarters
CmRih_VtVAs,They All SLAYED!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks way better than Deadpool! #fuckmarvel
CmRih_VtVAs,They should let Ryan Reynold's Deadpool appear in this movie for 4 minutes. Would pay extra to see what he does.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Trailer makers watched old AMVs from the mid 2000s and thought; ""Bad ass music timed to match action sequences, we could totally do this for our movie!""

Well done sirs."
CmRih_VtVAs,another suicide actor pobably :/
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn Is so EPIC! I love her so much!! 02:05 xD i DIED HAHAA
CmRih_VtVAs,Can we just talk about Harley in 0:53

CmRih_VtVAs,OMG THIS MOVIE COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!! IM SO STOKED (AUGAUST 5)
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley gets my dick wet.......😈
CmRih_VtVAs,Tom hardy would be a good captain boomerang if he got bigger
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't believe it...charisma and Jai Courtany. Who would have thought?

Oh, and the Trailer kicks ass too."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delavigne ❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,Im really exited for this movie but why do need the suicide squad if superman is in this universe? Are we just going to ignore him?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Por Dios, que trailer tan espectacular!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will do surprisingly well
CmRih_VtVAs,I got so addicted on this trailer then started watching all batman series mostly with harley quinn.. so love her!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or does the joker in this trailer look like Marlyin manson
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH U PEOPLEWe're bad guys its what we do
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll never get tired of watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,At 01:43 some strange figure cuts the subway train in half... it's a human figure covered in some kind of armor... just WTF? O.o
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, I don't think Will Smith is playing Deadshot, because Deadshot is not black. Can someone confirm this??"
CmRih_VtVAs,HORRIBLE loook and choice for Harley! She has the attitude and voice all wrong! She's not even cute!
CmRih_VtVAs,I am here just for Jared Letto so handsome and crazy character!
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh.
CmRih_VtVAs,When is this film coming out
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how the actress for Harley plays her I feel like it's incredibly accrete
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What's that I should break out of here and kill everyone?""
*Everyone stares*
""Sorry the voices.""
*laughs*
""I'm kidding! That's not what they really said."""
CmRih_VtVAs,They definitely picked the best song for this...
CmRih_VtVAs,i watched this trailer too much. i need help
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie keep getting sexy every time i watch this trailer especially the last part :)
CmRih_VtVAs,So everybody is saying they wanna fuck Harley Quinn and i'm here wanting to fuck Enchantress lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,10K dislikes .... Like wtf can you hate??!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,est lindo jeje
CmRih_VtVAs,"Call me crazy but I have a feeling this movie will be meh. Lukewarm at best, dont get me wrong, I want it to be the best movie it can be but more often than not a very strong trailer like this one is usually followed by an ok movie. Best song use but feels edited to feel like the movie is going to be one way but ends up actually being an okay movie. Bad movies try too hard on trailers and a lot of times good movies don't. I really want to be wrong"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate how they did heah ledgers make up and Jamie fox as deadshot...really?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hurm!! Not quite as good as Watchmen!
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will make over a billion.
CmRih_VtVAs,g
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks kinda corny in my opinion...
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot loooks like Emilly Autumn :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Dislike for idiotic song
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont know exactly how many time i seemed this trailer.. LOL
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 - year of the DC movie takeover.
CmRih_VtVAs,Next trailer will probably be during or after et Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn look more like Juliet Starling from Lollipop Chainsaw game, Joker keeps looking like a lead vocalist of an emo band, I can dig DeadShot but you have a potential movie and turn it into a action comedy where once again change the real persona of the characters... yup, not going to watch it."
CmRih_VtVAs,is it just me or when captin boomerang came out of the body bag to punch the cop didnt he look like dean ambrose frm wwe
CmRih_VtVAs,"Woah, cant w8"
CmRih_VtVAs,I need help...I've watched this trailer too much
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this trailer specifically because they synced up Bohemian Rhapsody to gunshots and explosions.
CmRih_VtVAs,I predict this movie will top Batman vs Superman...!
CmRih_VtVAs,_Daddy's Lil Monster_
CmRih_VtVAs,idiot
CmRih_VtVAs,very nice soundtrack :)
CmRih_VtVAs,horrible
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker looks terrible but Harley looks cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara!!! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,they are going to problably ended up betraying each other.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Trailer EVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I absolutely agree with you, RJKT! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Another anti hero movie starring Will Smith. Hollywoods really running out of ideas. They should just call this hancock 2.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Most likely a good movie but just like every other trailer (usually); we have all seen the best parts in this trailer already, no point in paying so you can watch it :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx eres tu?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 why does he still have the ''damaged'' tattoo on
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:19 Jinx, 1:52 Prototype, 100% i must see this film whole !!!!!!! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so nkce Sejms. bawdy science $ !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer has me saying... I want it all, I want it all, I want it all. And I want it now"
CmRih_VtVAs,"After hearing how this song fits perfectly with the trailer,it would be awesome if they could use Queen-Flash in upcoming Flash movie. :) FLASHHHHHH AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen? As in Oliver Queen? 
Green Arrow Confirmed!!

What? It makes more sense than The Joker being Jason Todd"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish they made killer croc bigger than a normal human he looks bad human sized if he was a little bigger it would've looked better
CmRih_VtVAs,你好，美国人
CmRih_VtVAs,"that dude that gets cut out of the bag reminds of Bronson so much, I cant be the only one he thinks this."
CmRih_VtVAs,Its so good that I could masturbate to this
CmRih_VtVAs,grate song bad harly

CmRih_VtVAs,guardians of the galaxy DC version
CmRih_VtVAs,"heath, why did you die? :'("
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love it when gud music is used in trailers and it matches up with what's going on too, like in the dead pool trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a virgin.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop of watching this! Help!
CmRih_VtVAs,like a kick ass
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else notice emma Watson at 1:53? Whats going on there?

CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody fits so well!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will esmit
CmRih_VtVAs,Can August hurry up. i eant to see the hotness of Harles and crazy ass Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,I just feel that if the movie suddenly all about Joker... I'm gonna be mad because the trailer is so awesome about Haley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"no more rated R.I thought superhero and supervillain movies were for the kids.They already can't watch deadpool,and let's be honest adults are already old enough to stop watching superhero movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,yeah not interested anymore.
CmRih_VtVAs,I've fallen in love with bad guys 😀❤

CmRih_VtVAs,Can some one tell me the name of all the songs in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,WHen Heroe Movies are like that... something is wrong with our society...but what is worse.. i probably will like this movie... wtf!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,wacthing this over and over again
CmRih_VtVAs,Devided we fall! Devided we fall! Devided we fall!
CmRih_VtVAs,"It really is that problem of the Queen song being so great and everyone just having middle of the road expectations for this movie, if this movie isn't as good as the song, then it will be like Michael Jordan wearing flip flops to a basketball game."
CmRih_VtVAs,I am debating upon whether this takes the cake as my most anticipated... I'm down to this and Rogue One.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer kept me awake all night, is that normal?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg, cant stop watching it. harley quinn is love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

CmRih_VtVAs,SHIT THATS HOT
CmRih_VtVAs,10 210 MARVEL fans disliked this video.
CmRih_VtVAs,More successful than BvS in its own right?
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this trailer more than i should.
CmRih_VtVAs,no
CmRih_VtVAs,When You heard the bohemian rhapsody too many times that you have no idea what happened in this trailer because all you hear is the song.
CmRih_VtVAs,"WOW.. Harley Quinn is amazing!

6 more damn months! Oh god! `-`"
CmRih_VtVAs,so who is scott eastwood playing
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker wants to escape so he can kill again.  The Squad are paving his way out of the Asylum.  The Squad doesn't want to go back to Arkham.  Batman steps in to round them up.  On the flipside, the Squad could be targeted by some type of special task force to get rid of them so no one has to put up with their criminal ways anymore. Just guessing. :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"THE VOICE IS SO NOT LIKE HARLEY AT ALL, And It feels so wrong with Jared as the joker... Its not like them at all..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"this can be such a good movie, ;_; so worried it's gonna flap"
CmRih_VtVAs,i want el diablos powers so bad

CmRih_VtVAs,i did this in speed 2 so funny
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Cara Delevingne...
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 groot
CmRih_VtVAs,favorite scene is when the joker is falling
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Joker is in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yes! Work it, Joel Kinnaman!"
CmRih_VtVAs,uh whats going on here?  Seems like a micheal bay movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so excited for thissss!!! Katana, Deadshot, Harley, Enchantress... *boner*"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is nobody talking about jared leto's epic laugh?
CmRih_VtVAs,together they'll crush the MCU #DCARMY
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is going to suck so much it is going to make Marvel's Fantastic Four look like the Avengers. 

Do you hear that whistling sound? That is the sound of this BOMB about to drop."
CmRih_VtVAs,I watch this when I'm stuck at work. It helps me deal with life. That's what Queen and DC does to me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto my favourite joker. I can't wait to show you my toys
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,watching 3rd time in the same day..

CmRih_VtVAs,"Es una pena para aquellos que dicen que nuevo joker de Jared Leto es malo, no saben de lo que hablan 😒 a mi me gusto mucho y a la mayoria de las personas,  es increíble 😍 a Leto  si le queda 👏"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm going crazy for this movie. What are the songs of this trailer? I really like it. 

Plus I can't wait when joker threw himself in the chemical thing and caught Harley. I can't wait for that scene"
CmRih_VtVAs,I fell in love with the trailer... then I saw this version with Bohemian Rhapsody and now I'm obsessed.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is gonna be so fun
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen just rocks
CmRih_VtVAs,no escape from reality. too late. my time has come send shivers down my spine stomach aching all the tme
CmRih_VtVAs,1:56 Effy?
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like Deadshot is going to be a really big character. I even thought for a second that he was the leader because... I don't know I'm just getting the vibe that he's a major character or maybe that's just me noticing Will Smith more than the other characters.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think Will Smith can surpass Michael Rowe's Deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,came here just to listen to bohemian rhapsody ☺☺☺
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody at its finest

Cool trailer brotha"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I usually don't like Bohemian Rhapsody, but it worked very well with the trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is well edited omg esp at 1:50
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys do listen to Boheimian rhopsody(The song in the trailer).
Best Song ever."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Mortal Kombat: DC vs Marvel edition

'FINISH HIM!' *DC releases Suicide Squad* 'FATALITY! DC WINS!'"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dunno, I think she's trying to hard to act crazy. doesn't come off as natural at all"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Freddie'd be happy to see that his epicness is used for so awesome thing like ""Suicide Squad"""
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song name pls
CmRih_VtVAs,who else came here for cara
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer confirms what I already knew..... this movie is going to blow
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if that Agent Eastwood is playing in this movie could be an undercover Dick Grayson...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Really.... I've seen a few people talking shit about Will Smith, yet you all accept Jared Leto being shoved down your throat. He's a shit actor from a shit band! An his role in this film is starting to seem more dominant... He's not the Joker he's a joke!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool forever
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is amazing! I can't stop watching it, I'll keep watching it till August. I'm so looking forward to it, beyond excited!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I want you Miss Harley Quinn

CmRih_VtVAs,Soo many good films coming out this year exciting!! i'm going to see everyone of them if my pocket will allow me :L!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"sup {o!  great discovery3 delightful miscreant what's your opinion about that, gxys"
CmRih_VtVAs,the best trailer of 2016 so far
CmRih_VtVAs,This is Warner Brothers failed attempt at trying to compete with Marvel. Everything from this trailer and the way the present these characters is very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy pathetic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Not trying to say that DC is better than MARVEL but seriously LOKY is the best villain they have so far. I mean he sucks in comparison to( JOKER| ZOD| DOOMSDAY| LEX)
CmRih_VtVAs,what is this
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like it's better to root for these guys instead of Batman/Superman lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I love harley quinn 😍💜
CmRih_VtVAs,"Shit! I´M IN TEARS.... 
#DCComics #SuicideSquad #DawnToJustice #BohemianRhapsody #FuckMarvel"

CmRih_VtVAs,So the Suicide Squad is sent on a mission to take out the Joker. I already love the idea.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Maybe its poison ivys monster
CmRih_VtVAs,Should i watch this in 3D guys?I need help!
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason why i'm not going to watch this in 3D is because i think more audiences will show up at the movies if they are going to watch this movie in 2D.I want alot of reactions when i see this movie but i'm still not sure if to watch this in 3D.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's watching this in 3D?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is this trailer so addicting?I know,its the song and the beat going with the trailer shots.Also they are showing alot of action but i trust David Ayer"
CmRih_VtVAs,liked it. i feel like harlyquins voice needs to be pitched up
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 When you can't drink soda in school but you still bought it anyway
CmRih_VtVAs,The editor of this deserves a raise!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Old school joker harly quiz and scorpion plus a witch nice man I added it to my playlist haha
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie, funny and hot"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley QUEEN ❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,SO MUCH FUCKING HYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie haven't out yet, and i already want a sequel"
CmRih_VtVAs,What's that I should unlike this video sorry the voices I'm kidding that's not what they really said
CmRih_VtVAs,2.5/10 not enough Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shit this looks...AWFUL.  No joke.  The bohemian rhapsody doesn't really fit either it seems too pleased with itself without delivering anything worth being pleased about.
CmRih_VtVAs,"we're bad guys this is what we do .......
. I FUCKING DIED"
CmRih_VtVAs,EVERYONE pause at 1:56 !!!! You can see the Joker behind Harley dancing and partying !!!! Gotta keep an eye out for all of Jokers APPEARANCES
CmRih_VtVAs,"Reddit please fucking murder yourselves. This is such a trainwreck of a movie, a moneystunt and a bait for dirty dumbfucks, and you are literally eating it up. Holy shit, I hope you get infertile and/or die in a traffic accident."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd rather see will smith play black lightning mr terrific or maybe martian manhunter i just can't see will smith in a villain role
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know how I feel right now 'excited' is an understatement...
CmRih_VtVAs,i think i fall in love with this trailer.. and the voice of Margot Robbie.
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks like a ghost busters movie
CmRih_VtVAs,aaand I have seen it over 60 times... I need help.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh yeah, and fuck Marvel."
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched this for longer then then the movie will run
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53 song plz?
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks crap :/
CmRih_VtVAs,...And where is Batman during all this?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I watched it 2 many times now :D LOL

CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) will be the only reason I watch this film! Looks awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone going crazy for Harley Quinn while I'm just here thinking ""Yes! Enchantress is all mine!"" Cara Delevingne is beautiful."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thumbs up if you think Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as The Joker are going to steal the whole damn show. Everyone else is going to be so serious. And using Bohemian Rhapsody is pure genius!!!...Also, freeze frame at 1:16 and see the big-ass 6-shooter Harley's using."
CmRih_VtVAs,A+ for song use
CmRih_VtVAs,WORST JOKER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lleva mas de dos semana, y me sigo chorriando*0*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so glad they chose the bohemian rhapsody. 

most people: suicide squad brought me to queen
me: queen brought me here"
CmRih_VtVAs,i have to see this every day
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is the mix between the beauty and silliness of Sofía Vergara and the craziness of Bellatrix Lestrange. What's better than a hot and funny girl with a psycho mind?
CmRih_VtVAs,ahhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22

CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,ok another spin off batman
CmRih_VtVAs,It's going to be weird to see the Joker in a film that's not a Batman film and plus seeing him work with other villains.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stand the three bladed light saber
CmRih_VtVAs,Jesus Christ I've seen this so many times that I think I gave it 5 million of its views
CmRih_VtVAs,I got mental problems with this trailer (need help)
CmRih_VtVAs,joker is jason todd
CmRih_VtVAs,joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Playing this in the background on loop while I work......hype levels reaching over 9000.

CmRih_VtVAs,Good song
CmRih_VtVAs,Ight gunna get some hate for sayin this but next railer should have skrillex or at least some kind of EDM mixed in. Think it would be pretty awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont like it how they made the trailer seem like a comedy filled w fun and laughter. and harley quinn..read the comments abt her :p
CmRih_VtVAs,i am so excited for this movie. i was loving the trailer but then i saw the release date. August? really?
CmRih_VtVAs,"♫Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?♫ Great song choice.☠ I'm mostly excited to see The Joker, Harley Quinn and Katana.☠"

CmRih_VtVAs,If yall havent seen that new suicide squad cartoon. suicide squad -Assault on arkham.Yall should check it out.Its the funniest cartoon ive seen in a while.
CmRih_VtVAs,1980
CmRih_VtVAs,"Heh, its soooo gooooood to be bad!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best use of rhythmic editing I have ever seen in a trailer ♡ I'm so excited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,so where da fuck is batmen at when all this is taking place lmao??
CmRih_VtVAs,"anyone else notice the Deadshot part of the trailer where the bullitt casings dropping on the ground, match the song? fucking brilliant editing boys! 1:49"

CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone explain me who is that woman with the mask? I'm curious
CmRih_VtVAs,you know who would of been better to play deadshot.. jason statham or karl urban or a new actor. no offense to will smith but i dont see deadshot i just see will smith with a custome.
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody gives the color for the movie!!!!!!!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,Edgy
CmRih_VtVAs,Omfg
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't care what any of you want to be critics got to say about this movie.. It going to be Fucking awesome. I'm pretty sure you idiots know that in comic the character have to change up to gain more readers. I know the old version are great but their new look and style are good to.. If you a true Dc fan go see the movie and support it. Unlike marvel fan who support this deadpool movie with it one liners and gay jokes.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney is killing it as Captain Boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,A LOCUST IS PART OF THE BIG TEAM
CmRih_VtVAs,They cannot replace the joker with that bum
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is always in a good mood she is rainbow and sunshine with a touch of villain
CmRih_VtVAs,So many idiots calling this a Guardians of the Galaxy ripoff... Suicide Squad came out before Guardians of the Galaxy...
CmRih_VtVAs,OMGGGGG. ILY. SONG? <3 <3 <3.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whoever decided to put Queen in this trailer deserves an award.
Especially the Harley parts, Bohemian Rhapsody should be Harley Quinn's theme song."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wheres King Shark? And why didnt they leave Killer Croc original sized? not enough money?
CmRih_VtVAs,Eirik
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat Ass tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"let's just agree that this trailer s the best one in comic world so far its interesting ,funny ,emotional and perfectly and beautifully  done .... the song s perfect , more than perfect actually and its well shaped with the sequence of the scenes ... amazing and i m sure it ll be a big movie in the box office"
CmRih_VtVAs,dubsmash -vilsonvikash or sucide squard 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Soooooooo...Owlman is going to be in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,MAMA MIAH!!! MAMA MIAH!!! MAMA MIAH LET ME GO!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how most people think that this movie will be bad only after a two minute trailer. everyone is a critic now, I guess."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto, DIED!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,yay 12a
CmRih_VtVAs,Are they in the city where superman and zod fighted? metropolis? or
CmRih_VtVAs,"Totally different tone from the last trailer. Not anticipating this movie as much as Batman vs Superman, but this is a movie I will definitely see."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley QUEEN, BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY THE BEST SONG EVER"
CmRih_VtVAs,ja q tem o MC Gui tem q ter a musica do MC Livinho
CmRih_VtVAs,were bad guys...its what we do!
CmRih_VtVAs,DUDE MOMS GONNA FREAK LMAO
CmRih_VtVAs,"whats the name of the songs ?
 cos ................ their AWESOME"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly thought this was a joke to Emos, Scenes, and Goths."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ledger and Nicholson. That's it.
CmRih_VtVAs,No one else has the right to play as a Joker......... What the fuck...
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm very interested in how Jared Leto will portray the Joker. He seems a lot more insane than the usual ones.
CmRih_VtVAs,whoever decided to put Queen over this trailer........ WHY DID YOU MIX SUCH AN AWESOME SONG WITH SUCH A CRAPPY MOVIE????
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks darn good.  I mean really f*^king good.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the panda guy at 1:42 but who the hell is he? Is there a panda in the batman movies that I missed or what is going on.
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone tell me who are the eye heads at 1:22
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that's what you call a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best trailers I've ever seen. Hands down...
CmRih_VtVAs,Fake trailer fan made.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no genetal
CmRih_VtVAs,Somehow it reminds me of The Secret World
CmRih_VtVAs,Did you know the original cartoon version of this. The suicide squad fights against Batman whilst carrying out the crimes for the black women? No batman no success.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why people are hating jared? I really liked him playing joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant wait for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,So much Marvel hate... I dont get it... Marvel and DC both got flaws and pluses so stop your goddamn whining. Jeez.
CmRih_VtVAs,I couldn't find Spiderman in this trailer. Is the cameo rumour really true?
CmRih_VtVAs,I Wanna Sample test.. for sample most danger people on the planet
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh god i wanna watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie and deadpool are the movies I'm looking forward too
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinss lines on the trailer are really corny imo...not really funny or witty. Good thing she looks good tho
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't count how many times I've watched this. Holy ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"everything looks amazing

apart from the joker..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is enchantress always in the front
CmRih_VtVAs,My God Scott Eastwood looks like the double of his dad.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian rhapsody surprisingly fits with this trailer, Like really well. Good choice."
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't know Cara was in it too.
CmRih_VtVAs,Zzzzzzzz   next
CmRih_VtVAs,Im watching because of j kinniman wooooooooooooooooooo 😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,SONG IN TRAILER? PLEASE :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,The ultimate enigma for humanity is how appealing it is to be bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yaaasss
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you make a fucking trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,another trailer i saw the batmobil..so bats gonna be in the movie???
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Just give the guy who chooses the music an award already
CmRih_VtVAs,cara eu tenho uma boca de chupa pica olha só
CmRih_VtVAs,I freaked out when I heard queen. And then I fangirled over Harley Quinn. I'm so pumped to see this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,It is amazing movie.....:)
CmRih_VtVAs,when you noticed that there is no batman on Harley's car.....
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be one to see on some shit in theatres. So colorful and action packed
CmRih_VtVAs,The colors look amazing in this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker should never have been made to look like a rebel biker.

That detail has already ruined this movie for me."
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,Hype made by hypes for hypes.  So much hype.  The hype is much here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't fuggin WAIT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't get how people like this crappy version of Harley Quinn. The Joker is not so bad, I guess..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're the baaad guys, that's what we dooo""
The moment I realized what a piece of crap this movie will be. 
Also, the ""I hear voices. Haha not really. No, really I do"" joke was just... ugh."
CmRih_VtVAs,cant imagine the number of Spacebar's being punched  at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I really the only one who thinks Jared Leto in makeup looks like Jhonny Depp....its uncanny, once you see it you can't unsee it...."
CmRih_VtVAs,quinn need a spank
CmRih_VtVAs,Matching the gunshots with the music is just pure genius.
CmRih_VtVAs,uuhhh. Kinna low brow stupid...
CmRih_VtVAs,When the Joker laughs at 1:28 it sound like the laugh from Bioshock vending machine when you try to hack it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is is dumb, but who is the damn bearded guy with anger issues?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think the character tearing up the train is either Enchantress or Blight from the new 52.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like it's going to be better then Batman vs. Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope the movie is as good as the trailers :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Isn't Deadshot supposed to be dead? He exploded in season 3 of The Arrow...
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen comments brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,great marketing. release it a couple months before Halloween and bank on all the  character costumes.
CmRih_VtVAs,i just cant get enough of this trailer!!!! Harley queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker: ''I can't wait to show you my toys''
Me: ''And I can't wait to see you my boyz''"
CmRih_VtVAs,I ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ HARLEY QUINN AND I AM DESPERATE TO WATCH SUICIDE SQUAD😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,puta
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish dead shot had his mask.... But of course will smith must be seen I guess...
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Trailer I have ever seen...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn is going to steal this movie. Awesome, can't wait"
CmRih_VtVAs,What's this about?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Esa musica de los 80
Esos héroes que son antihéroes...

Debe ser Guardianes de la galaxia"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can we just have films with Marvel Heroes taking on DC villains? That would be sick.
CmRih_VtVAs,Do you want to see my toys *Images a purple dildo with a razor blade on it with a smiley face on it*
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you put the speed on 0.25 and pause at 1:56, you can see the Joker ( I think) at the back..."
CmRih_VtVAs,They're trying so hard to be guardians of the Galaxy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this is the best trailer by far. Can't wait to see it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"People be thirsty for Margot Robbie lol. Just watch Wolf of Wall Street, you can see her be naked there😂😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,"WOW! HOLY SHIT! WTF! OMG!!

looks horrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,any of u guys like deathStrokes new look
CmRih_VtVAs,That moment when ur more hyped for this than Batman v Superman also Batman is appearing in this movie he is a bit of an important character just a bit.
CmRih_VtVAs,¿Para qué edad es?
CmRih_VtVAs,Súper mega waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy
CmRih_VtVAs,kero kero kero
CmRih_VtVAs,If this movie ain't PG-13 I'm gonna be pissed
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen goes with it soo much
CmRih_VtVAs,Did no one see mirai nikki's eyeball man?
CmRih_VtVAs,looks way better than batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,WHaT is diS shity sung? disview!
CmRih_VtVAs,best.trailer.ever - I double dare some one to do better
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes Adam Beach
CmRih_VtVAs,What happened to Harley Quinn's signature voice? :''(
CmRih_VtVAs,"1st trailer ""Bee gees""
2nd trailer ""Queen"" 

To whoever responsible of this ""I fucking love you"" !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like poop
CmRih_VtVAs,So... um where's batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,DC better than marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like I still have reasons to live
CmRih_VtVAs,this is going to suck. the DC movies are darker and edgier compared to marvel. it honestly feels like they're trying to hard. but I saw man of steel. I'm going to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,"What people say: I hope will smith don't mess it up

What people really wanna say: I hope having a black guy doesn't mess it up"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well... I really hate the outfit for the new Harley Quinn. She sorta looks like a teenager that trying to act quirky by dressing in bright colors.
CmRih_VtVAs,asuh dude ✌
CmRih_VtVAs,"Absolutely loving this. 2016 is going to be a fantastic year for superhero films. Deadpool, Captain America:Civil War, Suicide Squad, Batman vs Superman..."
CmRih_VtVAs,it looked ok then i saw will smith yeah fuck this movie that is all
CmRih_VtVAs,What the name of last song in trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"10k people confused the dislike button for ""Dis-I-Like""."
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this trailer too much. I need help
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,I started crying because of Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad Deathstroke isn't in it
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie reminds me of Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange.
CmRih_VtVAs,music goes perfect with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else find it wierd how deadshot is will smith.. -.- like cmon people.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is that a huge spoiler at 1:57? The Joker and Harley Quinn dying together in acid? I hope not but then again, today you hardly need to see a movie if you've seen the trailer. Same thing if you buy a DVD - all important parts of the movie are shown in the background of the menu before you even have a chance to press play."
CmRih_VtVAs,so want to see the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,That looks awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,the last super hero movie i saw was the first avengers movie.... i think i might have to watch this one
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is this trailer so addicting
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably the best trailer in recent years..
CmRih_VtVAs,Shitfuck
CmRih_VtVAs,very very good 👏👏👏 i want to see
CmRih_VtVAs,czlowiek duzego
CmRih_VtVAs,"I had reservation about Jared Leto playing the Joker, but after watching this trailer i think he's going to be great."
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanted Joe Maganiello to be death stroke soo bad. Hopefully he can jump on. The dc team sooner than later.
CmRih_VtVAs,It better be a 12A or PG13 or I'm gonna kms.
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait

CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone explain the difference between deathshot and Deathstroke

CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know the song(s) name?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie could use some Huge Weaving.
CmRih_VtVAs,He drunk a soda in the middle of the balttle
CmRih_VtVAs,I keep forgetting Margot Robbie is not Jaime Pressly and I sure do hope that the joker isnt robin...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know this is going to be a great movie, but I have one question. The Suicide Squad's usually called in to do what Waller would prefer ""under the wraps"" and also a suicide mission. This, however, looks to be a mission that spans the destruction of a couple city blocks. And no superhero heard about this?"
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,cool !
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith as Deadshot?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen Rocks!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody goes perfectly with this epic trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,was that deathstroke?
CmRih_VtVAs,still rly do not have a clue wat tis movie is about
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dont know, I enjoy this genre of movie but it comes across a little weak, more and more of these films are being demanded by the fans, that will watch this film whilst fapping with the comic book jammed down their throat and having Naruto and Ash Ketchum strangling them to completion, I mean come on."
CmRih_VtVAs,June moone
CmRih_VtVAs,IT'S COMMING OUT ON MY BDAY
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone out there cant stop watching it?
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking hate that song
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT TITLE OF THIS TRAILER SONG
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:35

""I'm not drunk enough for this"""
CmRih_VtVAs,The bad guy (tentacle guy) kinda looks like the Oberon warframe
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't make this movie funny... Don't make this movie funny... Don't make this movie funny... Don't make this movie funny... Please...
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't make this movie funny... Don't make this movie funny... Don't make this movie funny... Don't make this movie funny... Please...
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see this movie so badly 😱😱😱
CmRih_VtVAs,Other Joe got a promotion!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody. Perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,im afraid this will suck as a high budget movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,all the geeks on here are so sad but hilarious haha
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if Deadshot needs to get him one of those.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen in the background tho
CmRih_VtVAs,the trailer is actually so well edited to the song I wanna marry whoever is responsible
CmRih_VtVAs,Imagine heath ledger was playing the joker.. I hope leto can equal that performance.. Id say surpass but thats impossible. U cant surpass perfection. RIP heath
CmRih_VtVAs,Yassssssssssssssssssssssssss I'm soooooooooooooooo EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:57
So joker is going to jump into a pool of acid (or something) to try and save harley at some point. If it's towards the beginning: cool. If it's toward the end: lame."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is definitely how to NOT get away with murder
CmRih_VtVAs,"starting to notice a big similarity between heaths joker letos joker. they sound bit similar with that nasally tone and at 1:44 we've seen that motion before when the joker says ""tell your men they work for me now"" and that bit about chopping him up and feeding him to his pooches."
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto is a horrible joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"meh he's no Heath Ledger, but he'll get the job done."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"All I can say is, ""About F****g Time!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Rating
CmRih_VtVAs,"Does this trailer suggest that this movie maybe, just maybe, has a sense of... comedy? THE DC CINEMATIC UNIVERSE IS SAVED!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,still a better love story than twilight
CmRih_VtVAs,This might be a good movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,If Heath ledger was the joker ( obviously he can't anymore) this would have been wayyyyy better.
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought deadshot was white
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought deadshot was white
CmRih_VtVAs,them joker scenes are the best. especially the one with the weapons around him.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto will doing a amazing joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,SAITAMA SE COGE A TODOS ESOS   P  U  T  I  T  O  S
CmRih_VtVAs,1:21 GAY
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought dead shot was the fire guy because of how he was kept in water.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait a second. at around 0:55 on the trailer he says ""you're possesed by a witch"" meaning cara (the actor for enchantress) has already turned and is able to activate her powers."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer looks absolutely incredible!
CmRih_VtVAs,soy el unico que habla español y vio el trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Most these views are mine
CmRih_VtVAs,0:09 Melanie is in this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else is more exited for this than Batman V Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,who else thinks joker looks better than the dark knight rises 2008???
CmRih_VtVAs,So are they good in this movie and was that the joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC IS THE BEST, DC IS AWESOME, batman v superman and this will both be awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn 😍😍😍

Hoping they show more of her dark side throughout the movie, but damn this quirky, funny version is just ❤️"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who is addicted on this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else thinks Jared Leto should do live action Killing Joke movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like these trailers are showing that, aside from The Joker, Harley is gonna be the biggest star of this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks really fun
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so jealous of Harley she gets a handsome clown call me crazy but he looks better then ever
CmRih_VtVAs,why is will smith playing Deadshot? Deadshot is fucken white. Goddamnit i hope its not gonna be as shitty as the new Fantastic 4 movie where Johnny Storm(Sue Storms BIOLOGICAL BROTHER.) is black.
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs up if you think this movie is going to be great.BTW I think I'm in love with Harley Quinn lol well have a great day.     :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,i can watch nothing but this trailer for hours
CmRih_VtVAs,"9,973+ dislikes? The hell is wrong with you people!?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone also think killer croc is gonna die???I mean he's missing for some parts!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this? I only keep watching this 'cause the song sounds amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why the fuck are Joker and Killer Croc in this? Also, Will Smith has officially managed to ruin Deadshot forever. Greeeeeeat. Oh, and Killer Croc. Oh, what have they done to Killer Croc.... I'd legit only watch this because Captain Boomerang is in it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer of all time and the best song of all time!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is so hot!!! XDD
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg i thought the guy with the beard was tom hardy i got so excited....let down :(
movie looks awesome though can't wait to see it"
CmRih_VtVAs,👯👯👯
CmRih_VtVAs,white guilt is forcing Will Smiths' irrelevant character down our throats. #flop
CmRih_VtVAs,I really want to see this!
CmRih_VtVAs,This music. 10/10
CmRih_VtVAs,They should really make a Deathstroke movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Definitely going to be the number 1 movie on my must see list
CmRih_VtVAs,In the originals Harley fell in love with a maniac But in this movie it just looks like she found love with a thug only because the way the Joker looks. And am I the only non-DC fan who looked up every episode of every DC show just understand this amazing trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything Harley says makes me cringe
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07.
CmRih_VtVAs,"ddkdlflr

CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,KECEPATAN SINAR
CmRih_VtVAs,Couldn't they have made a legion of doom movie instead ??
CmRih_VtVAs,"So far what i saw was unsuccesful jokes in a ""guardian's of the galaxy"" like movie and plus a realy realy hard efford to make some of them look ""crazy and insane"" which is way overused here and it just doesnt work for me, BUT then again,  thats only my opinion"
CmRih_VtVAs,came for the music.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope deathSTROKE is in this
CmRih_VtVAs,seems dull
CmRih_VtVAs,I know I love queen

CmRih_VtVAs,Love this trailer and this song
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool > Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"Omg the tattoos on joker, this could make sense if it's true. They say tattoo man is in the movie. What if joker wants his power. Tatoo man is wearing tattoos of all his sins. What if joker wants that? That be an awesome theory."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley QUEEN! ♥ xD
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else pause this at 1:52? I LOVE YOU CARA!! 😘
CmRih_VtVAs,I loveeee this joker! Can't Wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer makes the movie looks awesome! except Harley Quinn, I wish she wasn't it this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,This should be a series not a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,If you thought Bohemian Rhapsody was going to rev me up for this movie...you were right...you were so right.
CmRih_VtVAs,Literally best trailer i've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can somebody please tell me the name of the song???
CmRih_VtVAs,The usage of this song now makes me want to really watch this movie. And you know what? I will. Better not be a disappointment dammit.
CmRih_VtVAs,What are you guys doing here! Go to the fine brothers channel unsub & unlike all of their videos!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 i got you fam
CmRih_VtVAs,"""how to get away with suicide squad"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"When Robbie says, ""We're bad guys, it's what we do,"" her Australian accent slips."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is joker part of the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"we have entertaining videos, check us out! you will be surprised!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd have written the match up of Bohemian Rhapsody and Suicide Squad as downright crazy.But the trailer was brilliant!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Leto's joker will be great
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's do something fun - Cara <3 hahahays :* cara delevingne brought me here :)

CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to show you my...toys. GGAAAAAAYYYY
CmRih_VtVAs,2edgy4me
CmRih_VtVAs,"at 1:56 you can see joker behind harley where it seems is where Harley is dancing, this could also be when the joker and harley jump in the car and encounter batman."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is this such a heath ledger imitation?
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Trailer Ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Queen??? Best trailer ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,love it 10/10
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,the new joker looks soooo stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,"The song choice was distracting, did not fit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this movie rated R or PG-13???
CmRih_VtVAs,I just want to see Batman Beyond come out.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53???
CmRih_VtVAs,I always pretend to be punching with Will Smith while rocking out to Queen when watching this trailer at 2:03
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best trailer ever.
Gone crazy with Queen.
:raise:"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song fits the trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,I came for the villain appreciation but I stayed for the lovable psychosis of Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,What rating is it
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this movie!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,WHO COULD EVER DISLIKE THIS?!?!?!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or is Anne Hathaway a 1000 times sexier?
CmRih_VtVAs,That metal clink sound though XD 1:54
CmRih_VtVAs,I think civil war will be the be better than this
CmRih_VtVAs,So cool
CmRih_VtVAs,WHY DC YOU TORTURE US ALL THIS TRAILER SHOULD REALESE A WEEK BEFORE THIS MOVIE CAME OUT
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope they don't delay this movie it looks amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody as the theme song. Awesome !
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate the new joker look
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this? A DC movie that has a sense of humor and a sense of self awareness?
CmRih_VtVAs,@Dark_Dragon_Master seriously? Quenn Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS TRAILER IS AWESOME!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,more excited than being saved from death.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll only watch this movie for Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm attracted to the Joker.  Somebody help me.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Keep in mind: Croc attacks Katana, she defeats and kills him and she takes his (rotten, filthy) soul with the Soultaker sword"
CmRih_VtVAs,I ❤ QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,No scape from reality...
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuckin' hate this Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,So who are the bad guys of the movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Mother Mary Immaculate through your intercession destroy the satanic cult of Hollywood and it's poisoning of our young ones.
CmRih_VtVAs,I suppose Wil Smith will want an oscar for this...
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer completely destroyed my hopes for the movie, I tought they where going to do a serious film... this looks like a cheap shot at comedy."
CmRih_VtVAs,wats the song playing in the background
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this video
CmRih_VtVAs,"Murderes and Killers. Flesh eating hybrids - A horde of crazed psychpaths, released from maximum security prison. And a PG-13 rating. This is beyond shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bisminlah
CmRih_VtVAs,ho my god
CmRih_VtVAs,GOD BLESS QUEEN AND FREDDIE MERCURY
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who isn't that big a fan of Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only off putting thing in this film is Will Smith. Other than that, the film looks solid and promising."
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is going to get avg ratings
CmRih_VtVAs,А Я  себя считал маньяком...
CmRih_VtVAs,what is this movie rated
CmRih_VtVAs,YOU MEAN THE BEST HEROES EVER? THE FUK
CmRih_VtVAs,Marry me Harley Quinn... my kinda lady and just the right kind of crazy !!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't help the goosebumps..love Leto 🃏
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like another Guardians of the Galaxy movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I can wait to show you my toys ....BOOM DEAL WITH THAT
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice to see they have an enlighten trailer version of SS... But I still like the first one... Dark and desperately EPIC.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well at least they're getting a movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,i watch this trailer more than 10 times a day.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like a revelation actually.
CmRih_VtVAs,looks awful
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like total shit
CmRih_VtVAs,big movie
CmRih_VtVAs,looks tasteless and very poor. ive seen many cosplays that are more real to the characters and story. if you think this will be any good then you are a hipster with no tastes.
CmRih_VtVAs,Releases in August.....Thats so far away. Have to make do with watching this trailer over a gazillion times!
CmRih_VtVAs,i have a theory that they are just showing the lesser scenes off harley to get our expectations low so we will love her much more when it turns out our low expectations were wrong
CmRih_VtVAs,i hate how much of the dumb blonde stereotype was shoved into this harley. and how cute it is to have a mental illness like rly?
CmRih_VtVAs,I gonna watch this because of Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love Captain Boomerang and am surprised and delighted that despite him being kind of dorky (as his thing is literally just throwing boomerangs), he's still survived through decades of comics and been in animated movies and is now being a main character in a live action movie.

They keep trying to get rid of Captain Boomerang but
he always COMES BACK"
CmRih_VtVAs,So glad Captain Boomerang is apart of this lol he is such a shitty villain
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't be the only one who is bothered by the fact that deadshots visor is on the wrong eye.
CmRih_VtVAs,sinplismente sensacional
CmRih_VtVAs,there's an animated version but i don't remember the name
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm in tears
CmRih_VtVAs,The atmosphere of this movie seems really dark to me... Or maybe it's just bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is that ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"to whoever put the legendary Queen song ""bohemian rhapsody"" to this trailer.............. you sir/madam are a legend."
CmRih_VtVAs,"why do i feel like this movie should actually be called ""Harly and Deadshot + some other guys that aren't important."""
CmRih_VtVAs,its gana be one of the movies that everyone will say is gana me bad then it ends up being amazeing and makeing a crap load of money.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody is the song
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,"This had better be rated R,"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how they timed the music to the ricochets at 1:04
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm in love with Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"At first, I thought Emma Watson was in this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching it
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how it happened. This is how The Joker died.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warner and DC. Best team-up. Ever. 

The Dark Knight Trilogy, V for Vendetta, Watchmen, Man of Steel, BvS, Suicide Squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait until they stop making movies to appeal to reddit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay maybe I do want to see this more then I thought I did. lol
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fantastic!
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here!
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker:  I can't wait to show you my toys!  :D
CmRih_VtVAs,so fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so fucking horrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking lame....
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is so much cuter as the joker 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer makes me so happy....
jared looks like he's having the time of his life..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie estaria tan orgulloso ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07  "" Si vis pacem, para bellum "" "" If you want peace, prepare to war """
CmRih_VtVAs,was I seeing things or was Harley pretending to shoot stuff really hardcore with what ever was in her hands at one point in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"what is the last song after ""mama mia"".....???
just amazing song"
CmRih_VtVAs,hell yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,"about 34,230,242 of the views are me"
CmRih_VtVAs,I already want to know the songs
CmRih_VtVAs,I know you don't know me but can you share this one for me support the fight against cancerhttps://www.gofundme.com/hmmae2gsIts the thoughy that count takes 2 mins to read no scam
CmRih_VtVAs,I do not like this Harley but even her should not be that stupid to be with this lame Joker cause  i don't get that CRAZY yet cool vibe of THE actual JOKER
CmRih_VtVAs,sooooo Jinx is based on Harley quinn..... or just copied?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is going to be so awesome, really looking forward!"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:23 is that Bruce Willis?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think the villains are going to steal the show in the DC Cinematic Universe. The heroes are great, but the villains are so much better, in my opinion. The MCU is great and all, but it has a major villain problem. Hopefully DC would overcome this."
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody sent me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is this the beest trailer, that you have eeever seen? You know, like the song"
CmRih_VtVAs,music name ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i like the way they sync the music beat with the bullets/explosions sound.... it makes the bohemian rhapsody more badass!!
and ow yeah, so far david ayer didn't lie, it's all about bad vs evil!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG I LOVE IT
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,August? :-(
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok yes, awesome movie can't wait! And the soundtrack...damn Queen, nothing compares to Bohemian Rhapsody!!! But ...😕 movie is not showing till August wtf? But also...33 million views! seriously! 😮😮😮😮"
CmRih_VtVAs,Русскую озвучку запороли.Твари
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is life
CmRih_VtVAs,I think i broke the replay button...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really do think that Cara's character (June Moone/ The Enchantress) will be the antoganist in this film. Based on what I've red about her character's history, The Enchantress is really powerful."
CmRih_VtVAs,Craziest thing is this trailer and the Comic-Con first look has more views than BvS trailers.
CmRih_VtVAs,Next trailer the song they should use is I'm a Barbie girl!
CmRih_VtVAs,YES!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""It's the voices!!1!11""

""We're bAD guys duhhh it's what we DO"" 

*cutesy giggling*

Is it their intent to make Harley totally insufferable and a caricature of a real character to serve the male gaze? Because holy shit this is like 2 minutes long and I already can't stand her"
CmRih_VtVAs,0.53 love it :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith will be the death of this movie.. why fucking why did you cast him... smh
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well one thing is sure, it wont be booring :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,so batman is out there beating SM's ass letting the joker take his place as a hero..... srsly batty? SRSLY!?!?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody ..... makes the trailer really awsome ..
CmRih_VtVAs,ow ow cara
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly this is one of the best trailers ive seen. im not even a fan of superhero movies
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone is thinking The Enchantress is the villain, but those people Deadshot was shooting at had something on their faces. So, I'm thinking Starro."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not often excited for movies, but this looks fucking amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Soon as they cast Will Smith (good actor but not for something like this) I immediately knew this is where this project was headed.  Should have been much darker and way more psychotic.  These are supposed to be super villains.  The worst of the worst.  But no, let's make it fun and family oriented with cheesy cutesy comedic lines...  I really don't like what I see here."
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC actually built a Bracer SMG for Deadshot 
 Marvel's Black Widow never had"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else wants to fuck Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,I have two wishes. I hope it's rated R and I hope Will Smith doesn't ruin it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody! 
God it goes so well with this!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,GoodTrailer--
CmRih_VtVAs,GoodTrailer-
CmRih_VtVAs,It's really hard to sing Bohemian Rhapsody when it keeps getting stopped and cut
CmRih_VtVAs,i can already tell this movie will be 1 million flavours of fun i havent been this estatic for a DC movie ( that isnt animated) since The Dark Knight oh and queen just fits this perfect this song should better be in the actual movie althought thats just my hopes
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is going to make people want to see this movie alone
Because people still love Smith he's always been a high quality actor
Smith loves his fans ISNT pissy towards them always in the nice guy roles"
CmRih_VtVAs,^.^ !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,wow this looks good!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer has me SOOOO excited!! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,JARED LETO!! You are the best multi-talented man!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi
CmRih_VtVAs,Отличный состав!!! Скорее бы уже лето...)))))
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that Will Smith?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice MUSIC
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just love Harley's ""Woah"". So cute..."
CmRih_VtVAs,queen bohemian rhapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"It feels like DC is purposely copying marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Think about it, Old music and either outlaws and thugs or villians becoming saviors or antiheros. Dammit dc.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Spider-Man ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Were bad guys its what we do i totally lost my shit at that moment 😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,first mistake trying to make them partially like a HERO cause they will never be heroes and shouldn't try to look like ones
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is gonna be so cool! It's just like the superhero movies I wanted to like, but couldn't, cause the characters were, by my parents definition, ""good"". Now we finally have some edgy characters that I can associate with, cause I have a dark side too! And since they're presented as ""bad"", it makes me feel like I'm my own person cause I just reverse everything I'm told!

Ah shit, I just remembered I'm not a 16 year old emo kid.. Dammit, scratch all that."
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of the last song? Thanks
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is this so popular in Australia
CmRih_VtVAs,i saw a fan made trailer for suicide squad befoer the 2 real trailers came out. it had the song seven nation army by the glitch mob and it was awesome i think it woulda worked just as well with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is my new crush
CmRih_VtVAs,There better be a scene like the animated movie where they all try to take out Batman and he just beats the crap outta them easily
CmRih_VtVAs,So is this just another will smith movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Rhapsody ❤
CmRih_VtVAs,I want a wallpaper from the minute 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is becoming like Marvel in trying to be PC.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Fucking Trailer Ever! ... I mean it's queen after all
CmRih_VtVAs,Poison Ivy??? A good one this time..
CmRih_VtVAs,"So we have to wait till AUGUST!!! ........................







Seriously. We have to wait that long?  Dude."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Cara Delevinge supposed to be the Enchantress?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 who else thought of the assassins creed leap of faith while watching th is part
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, I've just regained some degree of hope for this film and for DC's judgement in general. Here's hoping they won't let us down (again)."
CmRih_VtVAs,What's that song playing
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully this movie is as fun as it looks.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The guy who says, ""Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you people?"" Is that the detective from that Netflix series?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Mr. Nobody? Anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know who is that at 1:44 splitting the train I find it interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to watch this💕
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love that ""I'm kidding....that's not what they said *laughs*"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't like the Harley they casted. Her voice is supposed to be high pitched, whiny, and CRAZY. She acts like some one is is 45% crazy. The real Harley is 130% crazy"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope this movie is as good as it's trailers and are not just hyping us up.
CmRih_VtVAs,and where the hell repeat button is ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Cheb hasni
CmRih_VtVAs,"honestly I love dc, but I don't think this movie will be as good as everyone is making it out to be. Just looks like a bunch of glamour shots."
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto is increible
CmRih_VtVAs,"can someone explain who some of these ""hero's"" are except of course joker and Quinn never heard of suicide squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Stop trying to make Jai Courteney happen, its not going to happen!"
CmRih_VtVAs,cool!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show u my toyysssss
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't stop watching this trailer, I just love it and can't wait for the movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 mmmm
CmRih_VtVAs,"And that, everyone, is how to make people forget about Batman V Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still not sold on the new Joker looks, and Harley sounds really annoying."
CmRih_VtVAs,Brandon Garcia I am.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is so hot!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love DC, don't normally trust most if their movies tho cause they normally aren't that good, and I'm not sure about Will Smith (although I like him as an actor) as dead shot. But the fact that I've had a crush on Harley Quinn since I was 5 and half her ass will be showing throughout the entire movie, I'll buy a ticket. Yeah, that's how I roll"
CmRih_VtVAs,ive watched this 307 time now :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"They picked the ""Harlequin"" character for this one!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Was .....the Joker ever part of the squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,Um at 1:59 the joker looks like a robot
CmRih_VtVAs,I dont like the continuity or lack of it with the scars from Ledgers Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this some sort of if batman didn't exist movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Yahtzee messed me up with that logo.
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish the actor that played deadshot in Arrow was in this instead of this dude... But theyre both badass af regardless
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a feeling that this movie has multiple threats
1) Joker
2)Tatto Man
3)Enchantress 
I wonder if they all play a part to create this mess that the squad has to clean up. Im not sure about anything at this point."
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait for the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Which was the one possessed by a witch?
CmRih_VtVAs,que te den por el culo marvel :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith?! are you guys serious?!!! i am not watching this movie anymore!
CmRih_VtVAs,Beat that marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,What. I'm going to kill you all.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi
CmRih_VtVAs,Dirty Dozen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel sucks, Marvel's CEO donated to Donald Trump. The sickest fucker ever."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:24 Ryan Hurst ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen, your right I would have put maybe 5 finger death punch in it to give it a little more kick."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53 Cara?
CmRih_VtVAs,song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"For a long time movies didn't do anything interesting, but damn Hollywood has been dropping some sick shit lately. I am actually enthusiastic, all those damn great Marvel movies came out recently, now Fox looks it's is doing Deadpool right and Warner Bros. is going to make an anti-hero movie as well... Not to mention the new Tarantino movie and how the new Star Wars was actually good! Don't even start about the fucking raw awesomeness that Mad Max was. What a time to be alive."
CmRih_VtVAs,lowkey may just see the movie cus they put queen in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,please don't suck
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman was supposed to show up wasn't he?
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:29 in the top left corner of this shot, you can see a red boot and a black boot. Also, notice Joker doesn't have the ""grill"", the damaged tattoo, an has a Nicholson-like smile. This could be a flash back scene, where Harley has the classic Red and Black jester outfit. 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 Harley doesn't die..right?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause exactly at 2:08 
 Your welcome"
CmRih_VtVAs,whoever invisioned the joker.......TERUBLE
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I seeing things or did I see my beloved Jai Courtney here?
CmRih_VtVAs,So this is the allahu akbar squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the scene with Joker and Harley in the toxic white stuff?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 you're welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,Why did they make the joker look like that... It sucks.
CmRih_VtVAs,"observe 1:46 carefully 
you find some series of events......."
CmRih_VtVAs,probably everone says this but the look for joker is like .......why
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know I thought this was going to be a lot more serious with that first trailer.  Then I heard Queen and I was like, ""Is this one of those fake trailers?  Screw you!""  And now I see.  This is going to be awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Black Skinhead version of this trailer is better imo.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:53 this fucking bitch made me facepalm so hard I felt my own brain project out of my fucking skull. Someone shut her the fuck up.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG THIS COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY WHOOOP WHOOP I KNOW WHAT I WANNA DO!
CmRih_VtVAs,the amanzing spider-man 3
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone's so hyped for Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,funck top ana suicide
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is brilliant.
CmRih_VtVAs,honestly best movie trailer ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,so cute
CmRih_VtVAs,film brutali da paura uuuuuu 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is an alligator part of the suicide squad.how is that even possible ?
CmRih_VtVAs,joker's my favorite dc villian and heath ledger was my favorite actor .... shit I'm gonna miss him
CmRih_VtVAs,IT LOOKS AMAZING!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Captain Boomerang gettin' respect.  'Bout time, damnit."
CmRih_VtVAs,soo The Joker's gonna torture Harley Quinn with electroshocks and then throw her into a chemical vat.....ouch
CmRih_VtVAs,"this joker is a joke.
Ha ! get it ?
No, really is..."
CmRih_VtVAs,They coulda picked a better actor to play joker
CmRih_VtVAs,THE JOKER DOESNT LOOK LIKE JOKER
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 you are welcome! ;) 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY QUINN 💚💚♦♦♦
CmRih_VtVAs,People need to stop complaining when they haven't seen the movie yet.
CmRih_VtVAs,""" seriously what the hells wrong with you people"""
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is fucking awsome ! Jared Leto ! Will Smith ! Cara Delevingne ! and the music on this video is Queen :D  Fucking awsome !
CmRih_VtVAs,ayy... no m gusto este trailer ;v
CmRih_VtVAs,hi
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is so unfitting it's fitting... IT'S FUCKING AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,"They need to make a trailer about just harley quinn now with ""Killer Queen"" as the music for the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the most epic trailer I've never seen in my life!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome ^^
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm officially obsessed with this movie I've watched it about 20 times 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,ahahahahahahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,kandakariii
CmRih_VtVAs,LIT LIT LIT LIT LIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kind of a dark title for a movie considering how suicide rates are going up in the U.S., and is now one of the country's leading causes of death."
CmRih_VtVAs,Scott Eastwood...worth to go see this movie just for him ;-)
CmRih_VtVAs,5/10 needs more death stroke and Jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else notice Scott Eastwood in this? :)
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name of the song in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is already my favourite part of the film! ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,So this is basically Hot Topic the movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Totally makes up for Batman Vs. Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think the first minute or so looks pretty promising but than its pretty much shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"if i get goosebumps, I know it's going to be a good movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Good music thou.
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks like DC might break that whole ""NO JOKES!"" rule of theirs"
CmRih_VtVAs,I loved the last scene <3
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn plus Queen - bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,nobody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,is that girl drinking tea harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,guardians of the galaxy dc version
CmRih_VtVAs,I think anne Hathaway can also be Harley because Margot sounded and looked like Anne hathaway in a part in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,es mejor Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"IF HARLEY DOESN'T SAY ""PUDDIN'"" IN THIS FILM I'M GONNA LOSE MY SHIT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Even though DC has 2 movies coming out this year I think they beat marvel this year!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, questions for the people who created this

1. Why does Harley have cotton candy hair, no bubbly voice or heavy Boston accent, (I detect a Boston accent but it's not as heavy as Harley Quinn from the Animated Series or the Arkham games) and not her costume from Arkham Knight?
2. (I mean NO offense when I say this) Since when was Deadshot African-American?
3. Why does Joker have silver teeth?
4. Can you put up a list of the characters so then I don't have to go looking all over the internet to see what people THINK the characters are?
5. What city are they in? Gotham? Metropolis?"
CmRih_VtVAs,rip marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait until this movie comes out, I'm so excited because the joker and Harley Quinn are together in this movie!!! hell yeah"
CmRih_VtVAs,i like the new theme of the batman universe but honestly why would the girl who is controlled by a witch be a member of the suicide squad. wouldnt all they'd have to do is an exorsism on her to extract the witch
CmRih_VtVAs,crazy damn so fucking awesone
CmRih_VtVAs,worse joker ever. RIP heath ledger.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one tired of Cara Delavigne? She's fucking everywhere...
CmRih_VtVAs,This already looks adorable. I can't wait to see the new Joker by Leto. He always puts every character to the next level.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you wanna see this story before it comes out, go watch Arkham Assault. It's the same story. Quinn has sex with Deadshot, or somebody, in the movie. The Arkham Knight (Video Game) is the Under the Red Hood storyline, Superman vs Batman looks likes it might be a mix The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 and the Injustice (Video Game) storyline. Of course not exact duplicates but still the same."
CmRih_VtVAs,Seeing all the marvel vs dc comments and I just don't get it. I guess growing up in a small town I was just happy to find any comic books that I just read whatever I could find.
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman: Assault on Arkham makes me more excited about this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,They pray for villains when their heroes let them down.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the guy that is going through the train at 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, I never got the hype over the pictures for this movie, but the trailer looks awesome!! The pictures were too... clean? Anyway, this looks like an awesome movie, finally!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"How is it that Harley went from being my favorite batman villain to the character I hate seeing in anything? I'll tell you why: Fuck the Arkham games, they started it. That's why. Otherwise, fantastic job, this movie looks good. Harley, not so much, everyone else is pretty slick."
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone can you tell me every song in trailer ?
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like a nice movie....plus....queen!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley *_*
CmRih_VtVAs,I just realized how similar this and the Guardians of the Galaxy are.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like ""Saint's Row"" the movie. You've peaked my interest Warner Bros."
CmRih_VtVAs,such a masterpiece...
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx.:D
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn... hmm yummy..
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn... hmm yummy..
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait and please restain my hypeeeeeeeeee!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've heard some people say that this trailer copied the GOTG trailer by dubbing it with a classic song, and come on, get real. This one did it way better."
CmRih_VtVAs,kepaso
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rapsody fits this trailer so well *-* Whoever did this, should get an award"
CmRih_VtVAs,"me:AWWWW YEA CANT WAIT WHEN IS IT COMING OUT FEB?
*reads description*
but y"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Movie spoiler:



Harley Quinn is hot."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The other trailer was much better. I wanted to see the movie after watching that one, but now I do not."
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT SONG IS THIS?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is that girl in the water?
CmRih_VtVAs,The salt is real. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my god oh my god OH MY GOD THIS MUSIC!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,instead of music before working out just watch this trailer :)
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm kind of tired of superhero movies...but this looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks 2edgy4me. Especially the new Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG so exited to watch this😄😄😄
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait! ERRRRMAGURRD
CmRih_VtVAs,Live Forever QUEEN!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dunno about this, man."
CmRih_VtVAs,"while evertone thinks this is a badass comic book squad vs squad story. . . all the crazies in the world know its just a love story between the joker and harley quinn. fuck yea, oh fuck yea."
CmRih_VtVAs,JINX IS THAT U?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, despite being a Queen fan and a Suicide Squad fan, I hate this trailer. I have no idea why I hate this trailer since I know I'll go see the movie anyway but, for some reason, Bohemian Rhapsody just does not work for me for this film. Oh and Harley's voice in this seems the wrong type of annoying to me, like ANNOYING annoying instead of CUTE annoying. Joker still LOOKS stupid, the tats and teeth just bug me, but I have high hopes for the character. Will Smith looks like he could be Deadshot, lets just hope he plays him seriously. Croc looks awesome and I have no bloody clue who the guy with the Baron Samedi tats is supposed to be :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Deadpool and Suicide Squad, both companies' action/dark-comedy movies released at nearly/exactly the same time.

Competition is a wonderful thing lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to marry Harley Quinn 😘😘😘😘
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn just got sexier ladies and gentlemen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Movie looks Fucking Awesome,they did an amazing job"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who thinks this will be better than Batman Vs Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG my favorite parts r 0:53 and 1:35 every time I see this I just can't stop laughing especially 0:53.

What was that 
*dead silence*
U said to kill everyone and escape
*starts laughing historically*
*while saying*
Jkjk that's not what they really said."
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,oh boy cant wait for this . YEAHHHHHHH
CmRih_VtVAs,2:10 We're bad guys this what we do
CmRih_VtVAs,how dare they use the joker! heath ledger will always be the one an only joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this is going to suck
CmRih_VtVAs,Margo 💜💚💜
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG😱😱😱😱👏
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song that starts at 1:38
CmRih_VtVAs,prepare for the worst joker ever. -.-
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy fuck, this looks good. Finally a great cape-shit movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen music + Highlander= awesome... Queen + this=sad PG13
CmRih_VtVAs,"Q:Seriously what the hell is wrong with you, people?

A:We're comment spammer, that's what we do!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this rapsiody
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the title of the music?
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is Harley's accent?????

CmRih_VtVAs,How does Will Smith keep getting cast?  I have a feeling it has something to do with the antithesis of what his wife is bitching about on his behalf.. #irony.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have high expectations for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the seconds music of this trailer ????
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the seconds music of this trailer ????

CmRih_VtVAs,la magia de QUEEN!!! HOLA a los que hablan español!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What was that? I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry, it's the voices. Ha, ha I'm kidding... that's not what they really said...""

CmRih_VtVAs,This isn't the 1st trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,now try it with any justin bieber song :-D
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie mercury....perfect for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,this whole movie looks like a cringe-fest
CmRih_VtVAs,"what the heck, they have already given us 2 trailers for this movie (both are theatrical and not just little teasers trailers) and this movie doesn't come out for half a year. Kind of lame"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn's ass got me here

CmRih_VtVAs,dc>marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Which Queen Song is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,No one's gonna talk about the booty @2:07? k.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just finished watching Batman: Bad Blood......OMG best movie in a long time.Trust me, you will never see anything that cool in live action...go watch it."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think 2:08 people need to watch
CmRih_VtVAs,This better be rated R cuz this movie can't capture the darkness of this kind of story without it being R rated tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,What? A superhero movie that actually looks good.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm only watching the movie because of harley😂👌🏻❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,Best song for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the name of that song
CmRih_VtVAs,"someone catch me up because I am a little behind on my superhero/comic book lore. who's who, and from what universes?"
CmRih_VtVAs,cool
CmRih_VtVAs,omg
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Queen so much more now is that possible
CmRih_VtVAs,what a mess
CmRih_VtVAs,"Perfect blend of characters,action and madness ..hopefully one of the best movies of 2016"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I swear if she doesn't do the ""Mister j"" correctly I will murder her"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy, this looks awesome. At first i thiught it was fake!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Must see. Was Queen made for suicide squad or suicide sways made for Queen?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know about you guys, but does anyone else love the new Joker's appearance?"
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith will be the end bringer of this flick he just cant act and now hes suposed to be vishus miniacle killer come on out of all the other good afro american acters that could have bin casted this seems like a cash grab just because and for the name.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley better be funnier in the actual movie
CmRih_VtVAs,really cool
CmRih_VtVAs,The shitty queen music kinda ruin of the watching the trailer of this new movie experience
CmRih_VtVAs,Ow! The edge.
CmRih_VtVAs,"How big would this movie be if Heath we're alive and reprised his role as the Joker??? It would essentially be DC's ""The Avengers""..."
CmRih_VtVAs,august.. really that long
CmRih_VtVAs,YESSSS!!!!! IM SOOO EXCITED!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Boheimian Rhapsody?
CmRih_VtVAs,wait what no batman ? no hero ?

Warned you."
CmRih_VtVAs,OH HELL YEAH!
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song in 1:39?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else is just in it for the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the one that burns people and the one possessed by a witch?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm kind of disappointed  that they may go with the ""New Area 52"" backstory for Harley. I like it better when she goes insane on her own (even though Mr.J did play a big role in that) than when she's pushed into a pool of chemicals and she's forced to go insane. It victimizes her a bit too much. Then gain, I've heard many variations of the New Area 52 storyline, although a bit of that could've been lies. Either way, Harley is still Harley and she's still awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait fucking till August to watch this I'm building a dam time machine so joker can show me his toys :)
CmRih_VtVAs,😯
CmRih_VtVAs,"no not Jai Courtney again, havnt they learnt from Die hard and Terminator that he cant act for shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh dear God I can't wait for this version of the Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07  Marvel fans be like.

DC: seriously the hell is wrong with you people

Marvel: we're bad guys its what we do.

To all dislikes and marvel fans."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto talks like a Ferengi.
CmRih_VtVAs,Any one else get the chills at the end?
CmRih_VtVAs,my favorite part of the trailer is when they unzip the body bad and the dude gets up and punches the first person he sees lol!
CmRih_VtVAs,The guy with fire hands is cool!
CmRih_VtVAs,wow... this is gonna be terrible.... worst Harley ever.... not even an accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,33 Million Views in 12 Days... I am definitely going to watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,well thanks to will smith dead shot isn't wearing his iconic mask.... fuck you will smith
CmRih_VtVAs,"We're bad guys it's urrrp what we do, son!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith should be good, but i kinda wished they casted Deadshot from Arrow.  The guy was just the right amount of cynical."
CmRih_VtVAs,@0:28 Charlie fucking Bronson
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn the Joker in this movie looks like sht and not at all scary or badass as the old one. I mean where are the scars or the long af lip or the paint on his face or the long hair!?!?!?!?! ITS PISSING ME OFFFF. I mean it ruined the whole character of Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,CREO QUE SERA LA MEJOR PELICULA DEL 2016 Y JARED LETO NO SE VE COMO JARED LETO SE VE UN LOCO DEMENTE EL JOKER TOTALMENTE RENOVADO UNA NUEVA VERSION FANTASTICA !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can I just say how PERFECT this song is for this trailer.. okay bbye
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie (Quinn) is so fucking sexy
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so hyped for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Helo
CmRih_VtVAs,"So more scrawny women with little training compared to the guys get to do stunts while thin athletic BG players are deemed unable to handle stunt work. Yeah this movie can go fuck right off. Look at that agent bitch getting punched out, she's a bullshit hack."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm way more excited for this than Superman vs batman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Didn't know what this was till I saw someone put ""Suicide Squad brought me here"" on the Bohemian Rhapsody music video. Ironnnnyyyy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So instead of King Shark we get a guy with a  skin condition? Lame. Alligator guy is NOT EVEN A REAL THING IN THE COMIC. Was it an intellectual property issue, or too cheap to pay for the CGI for King Shark?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The movie looks like it might be awesome but I have a hard time picturing Will Smith as a ""bad guy"".  He always seems like a good guy."
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to want to watch this movie so bad
CmRih_VtVAs,if tarantino direct this !
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought this was a series wtf?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think, I'm the only person in the world who fucking hates the sound of Queen^^ ... maybe sth. is wrong with me, but I CAN'T LISTEN TO THAT, ESPECIALLY NOT IN SUCH A TRAILER^^.. sry"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks so awesome. And looks like they got a great Harley :D
Let's hope they don't fuck up the Joker. 
 ... And they got EYEBROW-GIRL! Yess :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"what a minute, so harley just walks around in panties for half the movie?
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
CmRih_VtVAs,hope they have batman in it
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm gunna be in the Pokemon Super Bowl Commercial after halftime show
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck queens ass hard
CmRih_VtVAs,ERMAGHERD.......
CmRih_VtVAs,Why the fuck is Deadshot's scar/eyepiece on the wrong eye...
CmRih_VtVAs,looks cool af.....except the joker. sorry but i just can't get into the new look
CmRih_VtVAs,I think crossbones will be in it
CmRih_VtVAs,This shit gon be good
CmRih_VtVAs,1:56 Kylie jenner
CmRih_VtVAs,kind of upset Harley doesn't have her iconic accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does this look so good and Superman Vs Batman look so... not. Maybe it's because this looks like it's having fun?
CmRih_VtVAs,that looks to be pretty cool
CmRih_VtVAs,"me ah gustado mucho 
pero le doy una año maximo de vida ajared leto desde que la pelicula se estrene

i realy enoji it 
but i give it 1 year of life to jared leto upon the movie premier

nice job"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG bohemian raphsody in this trailer kills me
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer looks deliberately better than the first one
CmRih_VtVAs,that. WAS. BEAUTIFUL!!! the whole trailer is awesome and makes me so excited for suicide suqad its untrue. GAH! im so amped that was awesome. that is the sort of trailer films should do for theirs. top fucking notch stuff and the movie looks amazing to boot.
CmRih_VtVAs,loooooooovvvvvveeee
CmRih_VtVAs,I would not call the the worst heroes ever. There more like BADASSES!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Oh baby! can't do this to me baby"" this trailer is fuckin awesome. bohemian rhapsody... man they nailed it. I love you queen! and always will.."
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is that
CmRih_VtVAs,joker in this film really looks scary. really like a maniac serial killer. great team work.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wanna see this movie mostly for the bearded dude screaming in the first half of the trailer. However, I HATE how Harley Quinn is portrayed in this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Really, I love such type of people. The last dialogue from the lady makes me feel smile from my Heart! When I am free from work and worries, I want to be in their team doing something crazy lolz..... Hope to see it in Cinema soon."
CmRih_VtVAs,"the most part I love 1:39 ...  
a blend of action and the music is very harmonious."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The slow buildup, The Neon colors, The effects synced with music, The little bit this trailer shows, the can of beer, the joker, this Trailer is absolutely perfect in every way hands down🙌🏽"
CmRih_VtVAs,2016-year of comics
CmRih_VtVAs,grrrr
CmRih_VtVAs,they stole my song i wanna sue
CmRih_VtVAs,looks ite..
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn's voice is not high enough and she's not scantily dressed enough. Not accurate
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hmm, so looking at how there are US solider's accompanying them, could this mean the squad members DON'T have bombs implanted on the base of their necks? If any of them try to run or disobey orders, the solider's are ordered to kill them? Hmm. This should be interesting."
CmRih_VtVAs,"that's not a movie. actually the american gov., with some others, did this in iraq and syria by creating isis!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Still think Joker having a grill is stupid; but Jared Leto's performance here is starting to grow on me.
CmRih_VtVAs,*WHO ONLY CAME FOR CARA DELEVINGNE??*
CmRih_VtVAs,I had zero interest in this film until I saw this trailer - deserves an oscar for soundtrack choice and editing all by itself!
CmRih_VtVAs,Me cago
CmRih_VtVAs,Has anyone else noticed this is the EXACT SAME plot to Assault on Arkham?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks amaxing
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who wants to fuck margot robbie hard in the ass??!!
CmRih_VtVAs,تافه جدا
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is sooo different in tone to the comic con one xD
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is going to be a GREAT year to go to the movies!! This is definitely a must see.
CmRih_VtVAs,So Harley is basically... Jinx?
CmRih_VtVAs,So this is the Basically DC Version of Guardian Of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,Should have kept it to the suicide squad from arrow >_>
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks full of itself over hyped over spending Hollywood wank production, plus it's got will smith, there's a shit actor if ever I saw one.  I'm young and I'm ready bored to death of these kind of films. We've seen it all before. There's nothing creatively new about it. Such a stagnant industry American cinema is. Shame everyone hates thinking critically for themselves so they lap it up. Like being tube fed your own shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,true dat tommy carr also i freakin love this trailer the only problem is the jokers lips... doesn't he have read all across his face because of the stitches???? but besides a super small mistake THIS IS AMAZING.
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer or movie summary?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like if guardians of the galaxy became a washed up crack addict, found a gun, looked in a mirror and started laughing psychotically."
CmRih_VtVAs,so no heroes? batman is nowhere to be seen
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith on pahaperse AINA :DD
CmRih_VtVAs,She doesn't have an accent. 😠
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 thank me later
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm gonna see this only because they put Bohemian Rhapsody in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"ESTA BUENAAZAAA...... ay dios, hasta agosto   yo ya quiero verla!!                                                                               PD: que nadie habla español por aqui??  :/"
CmRih_VtVAs,jared kicks ass.but can some one tell me what is this.movoe bout im not really a fan of all this.marvel or batman or comics things is this like all bad guys together of some cartoon or what
CmRih_VtVAs,NERDGASM
CmRih_VtVAs,In 3D Excellent
CmRih_VtVAs,B
CmRih_VtVAs,Kicker
CmRih_VtVAs,"another super hero movie ?

WILL-""Gaylord""-smith  - won't win a Oscar for this - so can we expect some crying next year ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wasn't really that excited about this until now as I never read the comic book. I knew Margot Robbie and Jared Leto were on the project and I figured it would be worth a watch. Now that I know Will Smith is in it, I'm stoked. Great trailer too."
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck will smith.
CmRih_VtVAs,All this trailer made me want to do is watch Freddy Mercury perform.
CmRih_VtVAs,lmao Worst. Heroes. Ever! but i will watch it!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Here's the deal...""

""NO! We will not let you go!""

Foreshadowing?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm thinking what if the next trailer use Don't Stop Me Now - Queen as the theme song. That'd be DOPE!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley can get the D any day
CmRih_VtVAs,HELL YES!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass tho when she steals the purse... Daaaaaaaamn!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Viola Davis is amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is my spirit animal
CmRih_VtVAs,"Boomerang just comes out and starts punching people in the face, rofl."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC and Marvel are both brilliant!! Stop arguing people and be grateful and enjoy them both!!😆
CmRih_VtVAs,"Here's what I think:
1. Adam Beach looks badass in here.
2. New type of the Joker: Psycho.
3. Would've been awesome if Tom Hardy stays and plays Rick Flag, but I'm willing to give Joel Kinnaman a chance.
4. Margot Robbie is HOT.
5. I always like Captain Boomerang.
6. Can't wait 'til August.
7. If they succeeded with this movie, than Marvel should make their equivalent: The Thunderbolts."
CmRih_VtVAs,So this movie is going to be amazing...
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it August yet?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this a saints row movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,poop crappywood programming at its shittiest
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish Harley sports a much stronger Brooklyn accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer make you wanna do some crazy evil shit haha
CmRih_VtVAs,OKAY BEST SONG CHOICE EVER. AND BEST MOVIE EVER. Really freaking love the style they're going with this!! Also Harley Quinn. I'm done. I really can't wait anymore!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was like K about SS but now, :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the name of this cool song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow, that sure was...boring... :/"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, This is how DC is planning to move out of the ""Dark & Gritty"" train the great Chris Nolan created for them !? Looks like they are trying to follow MCU, which isn't a problem. I really don't know if I should be hyped or disappointed. I'll decide after watching the BvS. I mean if you want to create ""Dark"", it must be Nolan Dark, definitely/specially not Snyder Dark. MoS was ruined. There was too much Nolan Shadow, and very little of his quality."
CmRih_VtVAs,ahhh august! ;(
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is how you do trailer, not like the spoiler fest called batmans vs superman. trailer has to hype you out to go see the movie, not let you feel like you have already seen it."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the music they put!
CmRih_VtVAs,looks fucking shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel. You will be remembered until suicide squad and superman vs batman comes out.
CmRih_VtVAs,아..기대된다!! 할리퀸♡♡
CmRih_VtVAs,00:08 What book does Harley Quinn read?
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever chooses this song is a genius
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the name of the queens sogs ?
CmRih_VtVAs,como se llama la canción de fondo
CmRih_VtVAs,wow this looks great! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait omg! THIS IS AMAZING!!!! omg I wanna die THIS IS SO AKDKAKDJJA
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool
CmRih_VtVAs,the best trailer i have watched in my life
CmRih_VtVAs,"why is Cara delevigne in this film? she must be really good at sucking cock, as she has as much personality and presence as a ghost."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Trailer Ever
CmRih_VtVAs,is that jinx ?
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn is going to be based off the of the New 52 version of her, I can tell. She's silly, weird, rebellious, and yes, a little sexual but in a taunting and fun way. But the movie producers WANT you to think Harley is just silly, just you wait for the movie, she's going to turn darker. Her backstory is too deep and emotional to just make her eye candy. At the end of the movie I think she will turn more insane and emotional."
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song playing during da trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,In real life I'm actually insane like the joker. I'm constantly laughing like him.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Unlike GOTG, Suicide Squad is actually getting casual viewers interest. I mean in just 6 months its first trailer has gotten 62 million views(50 million more than the GOTG trailer.) And it's most recent trailer has only been out a week and already has 32 million views and almost 400.000 Likes. Suicide Squad has an all star cast plus VERY well known comic book characters like The Joker and Harley Quinn. C'mon, if you don't think that a movie about Bad vs Evil starring Oscar winner Jared Leto, Emmy Winner Viola Davis, and Global megastar Will Smith isn't going to make atleast a billion you're kidding yourself!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't they usually get good actors to do the voices for video games?
CmRih_VtVAs,So you think you can stop me and spit my eye So you think you can love me and live it to die
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen❤ UwU
CmRih_VtVAs,Grat movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen is strangely perfect for this movie  the words the matching EVERYTHING  its the perfect song for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,YES! and harley quin looks hot :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"August though? who the hell is gonna care by then, thats too long of a wait!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"still ages untill its out, so annoying."
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto's performance will be on par with heath ledger's
CmRih_VtVAs,name of the song(know already it's from Queen)
CmRih_VtVAs,Rick Flagg is Robosoldier :)
CmRih_VtVAs,LOOKS PRETTY SHIT BORING AND PREDICTABLE TO ME ....
CmRih_VtVAs,"ахренеть сколько всего за 2,5 минуты"
CmRih_VtVAs,Not since The Dark Knight has a trailer made me so excited for the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"How do you become a Marvel or DC fan? You have to watch both DC and Marvel. And if you wanna stay a Marvel or DC fan, you have to keep watching both to know. Period."
CmRih_VtVAs,No we already know harley quin reads a book way to ruin movie smh
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie would be the best if Will Smith wasnt in it. Looking forward for Cara BUT I CAME HERE FOR JARED AND MARGOT!! #suicidesquad
CmRih_VtVAs,kd os br carai
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS LOOKS FUCKING AWESOME I LOVE QUEEN!
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST !!!! aw... sounds like 100 years more haha
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not any to these types of movies at all, I have never watched bat man, joker etc. but this one, imma watch!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,What the hell is doing Jinx here?
CmRih_VtVAs,Maniacs...
CmRih_VtVAs,"sucide squad love the crazy one bitch "" wat was that ?i should kill everyone and escape !its the voices!!!ha haa   am kiddinggggg"""""""""""" she is the crazy one love youuu babyyyy and waiting for you sweet heart"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey guys help me make my dreams happen 
gofundme.com/etm7bfk4"
CmRih_VtVAs,When wibo
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so sad about Harley's voice,love her anyways tho xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Killer Croc supposed to look more intimidating, than this... and Deadshot black? Seriously? That tatooed guy looks cool though..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"maybe I've seen this wayyy to much. maybe.

nah there never to many times you can see this"
CmRih_VtVAs,This Bohemian Rhapsody has me so hyped to this trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie and Jared Leto is the Best.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I must admit the performance I'm kinda most worried about is Will Smith as Deadshot. The ""Let's go save the world"" line delivery sounded like such a 'Welcome-To-Earth'-esque line, I just hope he remembers he's meant to be a bad guy, not a hero."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, so this is just going to be an attempt to make the DC version of Deadpool/Guardians? Pass.

Edit: Since people that watch this trailer obviously cannot comprehend a simple fucking English sentence... My comment is not about which comic was first released, or which movies are first released. The first trailer for SS was selling it to us as a dark, dramatic, and deep look at what happens when you torture someone into being a 'hero'. The very nature of the SS itself/themselves. THIS TRAILER makes it look like a movie along the same lines as Avengers, or Guardians, or even Deadpool. Those movies involved a simple plot with well-done action, and lighthearted humor and self-deprecating one-liners along the way. But that is not what the SS is about.

And it has been proven time and time again that LYING to your audience through trailers just to sell tickets ends up killing the IP/franchise 9 times out of 10. It's almost like fucking idiots like you fucking idiots that can't fucking read a simple fucking sentence without jumping to fucking conclusions are so fucking dumb that you cannot fucking tolerate a fucking little bit of fucking misleading advertisement.

I want the Suicide Squad to be a great movie, but this trailer worries me. So I will be waiting for the time that I can see it at a very very very very very low monetary cost, or until the reviews redeem it."
CmRih_VtVAs,I dont like this :|
CmRih_VtVAs,This Harley sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks shit
CmRih_VtVAs,a girl in this movie is jinx the character of lol league of legends
CmRih_VtVAs,worst enemies? bad guys? more like worst movie ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,uughh! Wish Will Smith wasn't in this movie -_-t
CmRih_VtVAs,sad that harlequin doesn't look like the original :/
CmRih_VtVAs,was that Harley the joker pulled out of that pit.. i think it was :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name anyone please? its so fking awesome!!... 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,YYAASSS HAVE TO WATCH!
CmRih_VtVAs,The girl looks like Jinx from Lol! Like a little bit crazy!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Before i saw this trailer i really disliked the thought of Will Smith being deadshot, and Jared Leto being the joker. After seeing this trailer i have completely changed my mind. I am definitely seeing this movie in theatres."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking forward seeing Joker and Harley!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let's be honest, after the latest batman v superman trailer, this is gonna blow it out the water. Also, the new Joker is surely gonna be more fitting than the depressing and emotional performance given by Ledger. Hate me if you will, but Ledger's Joker is the most overrated performance in recent film history."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lets settle this. 

Just like Christian Bale's Batman is NOT in the same universe as Ben Affleck's new portrayal, Jared's Joker is NOT the same Joker as Heath Ledger's. Their performances will not be comparable, because they're playing two entirely different versions of the character. 

So for all of the people saying ""There will never be a better Joker than Ledger"", in HIS specific portrayal of it, you're right. But Jared didn't step into the role of Ledger's Joker, he's created something entirely new to fit into the DCCU, and it looks like he's done a pretty damn good job of it. When the solo Batman movie comes out--if the Joker is in it--the onscreen rivalry between Affleck's Batman and Leto's Joker will be a drastically different one than the type that Christian Bale and Heath Ledger had. 

Now everyone stop bitching, and just enjoy the fact that we all get a Suicide Squad movie, aight?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bye Bye Marvel ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bye Bye Marvel ?
CmRih_VtVAs,BAAADAASSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is going to be FUCKING AWESOME. 2016- year of the comic book movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is fucking hottttttttt
CmRih_VtVAs,This is better than the corny deadpool movie that's for sure
CmRih_VtVAs,"marvel,I LIKE ALL Dc comics,i like batman.THATS ALL!"
CmRih_VtVAs,would be better without Will smith...
CmRih_VtVAs,psyched for this but disappointed that hardy was't casted
CmRih_VtVAs,"Other than Will Smith being in this film, I am actually genuinely very interested in seeing this. 

Deadpool on Valentine's Day and then Ill wanna see this

(I don't hate Will Smith, he just always plays ""Will Smith"" if you know what I mean)"
CmRih_VtVAs,wohooo jokeer
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 tho.....
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:59 does she die??
CmRih_VtVAs,Im I the only one who watched it 100 times?
CmRih_VtVAs,fuu
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,looking forward to this wSy ore then BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,OW THE EDGE
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not crazy about this movie's version of Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,shut up and take my money
CmRih_VtVAs,suicide squad are just like guardian of the galaxy. 5 members in S.s and 5 members too in guardian of the galaxy..?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm personally a marvel fan but this was a good trailer and it, will most likely be a great film"
CmRih_VtVAs,The girl wearing mask reminds me of bridal mask I screamed*😆😆😆
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait when Joker will show me his... TOYS! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,0:17 I didn't know FuriousPete was in the Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,its gona be a shit movie
CmRih_VtVAs,呵呵
CmRih_VtVAs,JOKER: Do you wanna know how I got these grillz?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jovany Rodriguez brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just what the world needs right now. This shit is part of the problem. I bet somewhere in the world someone will kill people, and think the government will let them out to track down the joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit yes
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squats-
Plot: Chicks with boney asses try doing squats to get them bigger but ends up killing themselves because of a spinal injury."
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably one of the best Jokers yet he looks and souds  demented af!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,hyPE IS REAL
CmRih_VtVAs,"Awww, no jokers daughter?"
CmRih_VtVAs,nice choice of song
CmRih_VtVAs,Everytime I watch this it just gets me more and more hype.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:59 is confusing to me, it looks like joker had jumped in some stuff to pull harley out of it. Joker was never romantically involved with her like that, he treated her like crap all the time."
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this movie is dark. It's time to show kids these day that DC isn't for babies
CmRih_VtVAs,whats is the song? is amazing😍
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,I came up with a stronger super than any super ever created his name is power lord
CmRih_VtVAs,Well can't wait for under the red hood Ben don't let me down.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,Gh
CmRih_VtVAs,why does joker's laugh sound like penguin
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, Joker and Harley.  What have these soulless Warner Bros. executives done to you..."
CmRih_VtVAs,All I'm saying is look at his flesh at 1:58 and pause it at 1:43. That's a leap to say it's Leto and I'm not saying that but maybe some kind of connection? I'm probably looking into this a bit much.
CmRih_VtVAs,"another movie set up in fucking chicago, jesus fucking christ !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks awesome! Can't wait till August!
CmRih_VtVAs,"9,513 Marvelitas doesn't liked this video"
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to love it so badly....
CmRih_VtVAs,"if you're gonna use the song, make the movie live up to it"
CmRih_VtVAs,how can you make a hipster joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh to hear Marrgot Robbie say ""Puddin"".... that is what i want..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT AND THANKS TOBUSCUS LITRAL TRIALER
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks awesome but do we really need to wait That Long!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hyped for Suicide Squad!! and Deadpool, that shit gonna be funny 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks  so much  better  than  batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks  so much  better  than  batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"No Ragdoll, no Scandal, no Catman, I feel like other than Deadshot they picked all the lame members."
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love Villain characters so bad.. that feels so wrong.
CmRih_VtVAs,amaziiiiing.....!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song called?
CmRih_VtVAs,0:53-1:03
CmRih_VtVAs,My buddies and I joke about this song so much that I couldn't take this seriously
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so excited about this film, but. I'm SO ANNOYED ABOUT THE LONG ASS WAIT!!! I'm an impatient soul, I waNT THIS FILM NOW."
CmRih_VtVAs,The best movie trailer of 2016!!
CmRih_VtVAs,can someone tell me what movie this rated
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like it has some Asian cinema influenced..start by saying 'Old Boy' ..'Battle Royal'.. -- and throwback to Blade Runner and Dark Knight
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie will either crash and burn horribly or it'll be one of the best of 2016...either way I'll be seeing it. Jared Leto will never be Heath Ledger, that is obvious. Yes, Heath was one of the greatest, if not the absolute best Joker there ever will be. But Jared brings in a new character of him to the scene and I think that's how we have to look at it. Jared brings his own style of the Joker. Instead of comparing the two we should see it as two different characters completely"
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing sync with the song throughout the video. Queen ftw!
CmRih_VtVAs,"OKAY,that actually does look PRETTY COOL."
CmRih_VtVAs,"In DC we trust. Fuck Marvel's commercial crap, at least this looks more grounded."
CmRih_VtVAs,Geez is it August yet??
CmRih_VtVAs,"""When I wore that number it was classy, more flashy mater-dene than motor cycle fetish."" I guess DC doesn't give a shit how the Joker is portrayed anymore."
CmRih_VtVAs,"01:29 i would still be enjoying myself like he did, if that happens, its not everyday you can lie down in a almost perfect circle of weapons like that"
CmRih_VtVAs,WILL SMITH!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know much about the suicide squad but the trailer,looks so stinking sick!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well im feeling sad now..tom hardy was replaced for the role of rick flagg..but maybe thats a good thing because rick flagg looking crazier than the squad itself would look weird
CmRih_VtVAs,looks shit
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd be more hyped if it was the Arrow/Flash DC universe for this. The suicide squad actors were perfect in Arrow.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 spoil
CmRih_VtVAs,@1:22 my goosebumps starts when Joker was laughing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who thinks Joker is the best villain?
CmRih_VtVAs,The only thing i dont like about this move trailer is that it showed a little bit too much of the cool scenes in the movie. Other then that it is amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is crazy i dont know who half the people are
CmRih_VtVAs,no  one will watch Batman Vs Superman now lmaol
CmRih_VtVAs,hi
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name of the first song in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who the fuck is that at 1:44, it keeps bugging me, at first I thought it was enchantress but it looks like some zombified poison ivy witch thing guy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I find Harley incredibly sexy
CmRih_VtVAs,"The girl with the bat reminds me of Jax from League of Legends, I'm sure Jax is based off her"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can imagine Harley Quinn with that new Yorker accent
CmRih_VtVAs,More people watch useless movie trailers in 1 week of its release than watch 9/11 videos. What a sad world we live in. America deserves the fascist government they will get.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is the song so romantic ??
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this movie does right! If it doesn't that will be 250.000.000 in the trash
CmRih_VtVAs,for a second i thought I saw Sheamus & Dean Ambrose 😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,1:39 Harley Quinn pretending to have a gun
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:08
Your welcome"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE

CmRih_VtVAs,este tráiler si que promete......:3
CmRih_VtVAs,Very ineffective considering they'd all kill themselves.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else has watched this 100 times?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i can,t wait for both"
CmRih_VtVAs,song!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Too late.............Open the gate! - Great editing.
CmRih_VtVAs,THE JOKEEEEER!!!!  I'm gonna die watching the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Only problem i see is killer croc, he doesn't  really look like a croc, I wish they had done him like the video game, but apart from that, this movie looks amazing!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Joker goes to jail at the end honestly he will be back for the Justice league or something
CmRih_VtVAs,So this is everyone batman fought?....or
CmRih_VtVAs,Graphic designers be like that font tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant tell what i want to see more batman vs superman or the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is the second half of the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 the bad guy of the movie :D ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks this movie will suck hard?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wats the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,This and deadpool will be the most different superhero movies of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,"this had better be as nutty as the trailer...
not some oppurtunity for making happy meal toys"
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK THIS SHIT IM HYPED FOR DEADPOOL
CmRih_VtVAs,SCARY😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay so I'm sold I will probably go see this sans kids though for obvious reasons.
CmRih_VtVAs,lo amo alguien kiere ser su novia del guasón yo si es ermosa
CmRih_VtVAs,PLZ DONT SUCK!! This looks awesome ! I hope its not one of those movies where the trailer is better haha.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the choice of song
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith = GG. insta hit.
CmRih_VtVAs,i LOVE HARLEY QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,"After Deadpool, this is the movie I'm looking forward to the most!!! I loved the tonal contrast between the first and second trailers. As long as there's action and explosions, I'll be freaking happy! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Watch ""second chance"" on fox Friday's at 8"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemein rhapsody......great stilllllllllllll
CmRih_VtVAs,"Freddie Mercury brought me here. (And yes I'm the guy with the top comment in Bohemian Rhapsody, so don't listen to the deceivers that pretend to be me)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst. Heroes. Ever.
But they are pretty freaking hilarious."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't Wait!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Batman and it's villains but... wow... what a sexist looking film
CmRih_VtVAs,"Like everyone i just watched it like 50 times, but spent more time in the minute 2:07 than the rest of the movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't know harly quin was a member of the suicied squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait until August, I can't, I need this now, now, please I need this, it won't get out of my head. HELP!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,a super hero movie for bad guys interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,I like DC and Marvel but still you have to admit marvel are better at planning their movies (Build up to avengers/Infinity stones/New avengers/Thanos/Infinity War) Marvel already have 12 films out and DC have only just managed to sort their schedule out with suicide squad being the 3rd movie in the DCCU.
CmRih_VtVAs,I projected this trailer onto Apple TV so I could watch it on the bigger screen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nicely done preview. Margot Robbie bombed this role, costume sucks. The rest looks cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,Now we're talkin'!
CmRih_VtVAs,Look like Saint Row :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cool.
Just 1 question though ,who/what is the enemies?"
CmRih_VtVAs,August???!! Seriously?! Omg

CmRih_VtVAs,i would love to watch this ^_^
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddy Mercury brought me here!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:29, befitting of Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer was a lot more light-hearted than the other one, it's nice bc I thought it would be serious the whole time..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I see dead people in America on the street. Try to find the true.
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever decided to put Queen over this trailer........GIVE THEM A RAISE!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:18 DUCT TAPE
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why but I get this ""Borderlands Psycho"" vibe from the Joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Peces
CmRih_VtVAs,Same
CmRih_VtVAs,0:00 - 2:31 Best part of the trailer. Thank me later <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"COOL..big time actors, comedy, diversity! I mean the villans are ""as evil as their suppose to be"" but I CANT WAIT"
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't play LOL but Margot Robbie reminded me of Jinx. A lot.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry, but Will Smith looks out of place in this movie. & I definitely see Harley Quinn being the star of it, from the looks of the trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,That ass though.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hay every body > This is yours truly, The trol.> Hay, did you hear the latest news of the day on ALL American media ??? The Barby Doll ( however you spell it) got a new makeover. Yes , it was all over the news. Isn't that great!!!. Also; there is a new GIG for people out there. You tape yourself up with DUCT tape and then you try to get free.> One moron got taped up standing, and fell back and cracked his skull . Now he is brain damaged. well , he probably was brain damaged like most American teens, to begin with... Hay, also ( this is another good one) people now inhale this type of dost and choke. Isn't that great!!!  Yes; America is ""VERY"" sick, and I might add, and getting sicker,> like most of you below here. END"
CmRih_VtVAs,vou ver esse trailer todos os dias da minha vida
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone think the thing they will be fighting reminds you a lot of Alex Mercer from Prototype?
CmRih_VtVAs,How the Joker just makes this fearless free fall into the acid in combination with Freddy singing in the background... It's like 1 second... but one awesome second doing something to me I can't explain.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy wannabe
CmRih_VtVAs,at 1:28-1:29 you can see Harley Quinn's red and black high heels. 😨😱
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Dunno - it was better with the haunting music. This just makes it seem like a straight up action film.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I might be considered stupid but I thought Tom Hardy was 
Captain Boomerang"
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best film trailers ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for this than Batman v. Superman and Civil War combined. This trailer is perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,who here thinks this will tie into batman v superman in some way
CmRih_VtVAs,first Bee Gees and now Bohemian Rhapsody as the trailer song? sign me up for the Hype Train!
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEEEENNN

CmRih_VtVAs,"Complete list of members in movie in case someone wants to know are: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Killer Croc, Rick Flag, Cpt. Boomerang, Slipknot, El Diablo, Enchantress, Katana, and The Joker is bonus!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn, El Diablo, and Deadshot only reason i'm going to watch it, though i think they should have included Black Spider and King Shark."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how this trailer is a great way to more people hear my favourite song ( Bohemian Rhapsody the name btw)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I find Cara is a better Model than Actress :) ❤
But she's pretty asf and I would be gay for her 😂😂❤"
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,I gotta go watch Wayne's world now
CmRih_VtVAs,queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beautiful music of course, but doesn't go with the video. Poorly put together."
CmRih_VtVAs,still...WORST. HARLEY. EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know who any of these "" bad "" guys are but this movie looks great !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Man this movie looks stupid as shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"who or what is that, that completely fucks the train??"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The guy in the metro is Slipknot. If you stop the video and pay attention, you can see the ropes covering his body and the ropes come out from his arm. I know . I know. They changed the original Slipknot. But they sure made him cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1 like - KISS YOUR CRUSH

CmRih_VtVAs,"How are the suicide squad trailers getting more views than the Batman v Superman trailers, I knew people were excited for suicide squad but I didn't know they were more excited for it than BvS. Could SS actually have a bigger opening than BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dc or marvel







made deadpool?"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:37 lool hahahahah
CmRih_VtVAs,at 1:44 whos that??
CmRih_VtVAs,The new Joker has nothing on Ledgers and while they are different and comparing them is essentially point the fact (opinion really) remains that it's just not looking to be nearly as good.
CmRih_VtVAs,i love this bad team 😆
CmRih_VtVAs,I .. want... it .. NOW!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is that destroying the train at 1:44?

CmRih_VtVAs,When you understand that film will be cool
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:59 what is wrong with jokers skin? Looks like its all muscle
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh wow. Everything in this looks awesome. EVERYTHING. I mean i was skeptical about them using the word bad guys on themselves being too corny but everytime harley quinn says it, i get the urge to touch myself and whisper ~bad guy~"

CmRih_VtVAs,I. Am. So. Excited. I. Can. Not. Function.
CmRih_VtVAs,whos also here because of freddy mercury?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This gonna be Harley Quinn movie - 1st retrospection about her life before and with Joker, and later actual action with Suicide Squad.
Personally i think she puts to much action on her face while speaking some crazy stuff, im kinda afraid she can destroy this movie (just as im afraid that Will Smith can be like main character there and rest of squad could be in his shadow) but it's only a trailer, who knows how whole movie will be and if it's how Harley should be, and Will will be so often on screen as others."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 You are welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,9k people are those jackasses DC Haters
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Dc is going to be consistent about this villain stuff, then

CmRih_VtVAs,why is this so far away ffs
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Mmm
CmRih_VtVAs,OH.. MY.. GOD..
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley's one-liners in this make me cringe
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wasn't going to see this movie because of how silly the joker looks, but I think this trailer sold me"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's the guy from wildest dreams vid clip
CmRih_VtVAs,Using Bohemium Rapsody for this trailer was absolutely brilliant!  Was anyone else singing along?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is it when actresses play blondes they don't dye their eyebrows...
CmRih_VtVAs,I sooooow definitly have to see this movie! I really must see this one!!

CmRih_VtVAs,"What if, they will create a movie, Heroes and Villains will team up. Meh."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn(Jeonghan). Okay.
CmRih_VtVAs,sooo cool... :-D
CmRih_VtVAs,"and what are they supposed to save the world from, insipid normality?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Say what you wan't about DC. But they have the better villains
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one whos fucking disgusted by this crappy joker and whorish harley? i mean i still hope for the best but this trailer reaaaaaally fucked me up bad. looks just not right to me
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody! I love this song!
CmRih_VtVAs,I will never get over this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Things about this trailer...
1. Harley Quinn is funny & scary at the same time
2. She's the best character!!!
3. When Harley was saying should she kill everybody,ain't that the guy from TSwift's Wildest Dreams vid??"
CmRih_VtVAs,i think the best trailer ever for villains movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,we know the batman is long story ...so why they doesn't have series ???
CmRih_VtVAs,when joker says i wanna show u my toys i thought this isnt a porno....right?...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so hyped for this movie. I just hope Jai Courtney doesn't fuck up his role of Captain Boomerang, lately everything he touches turns to shit and his arrogance is something of an annoyance to me. As for Will Smith, ugh, they just needed a high name actor to help sell the movie. They can still do it with unknowns. . . 

Oh fucking well, on the other hand I'm Loving ALL the characters, their looks, the cheesy expected dialogue and Jared Leto as The Joker, they have my respect as a comic book reader and toon superhero fan of both DC and Marvel. . . 

One more thing, REALLY PEOPLE? Really? I see a lot of people asking what the song is, you can't tell me no one knows who this band is! Fucking wow! The music education has really gone down the fucking tube. Oh well, you can have your shitty Kesha's, Myley Cyrus and shit for brains, fake ass Drake. . . For those who don't know it, it's Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. . . Fucking serious?! lol! ! ! :-) :-) :-)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody is the best song ever
CmRih_VtVAs,LoL Jinx new skin confirmed...
CmRih_VtVAs,Song at the end?
CmRih_VtVAs,OH> MY> GOD> I HELD SHIFT TO PRESS PERIOD TOO>
CmRih_VtVAs,DC rocks.Marvel loser.
CmRih_VtVAs,"dc to marvel : can""t wait to show you MY TOY in 2017 (justice league)"

CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,someone tell me the song name plz
CmRih_VtVAs,this has nothing to do with race but im not too sure about will as dead shot
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think, I am possessed by this trailer.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Slipknot punches the chick out xD .....he will die
CmRih_VtVAs,and also their roles?
CmRih_VtVAs,cara's american accent leaves a lot to be desired
CmRih_VtVAs,THERE ARE DISLIKES??!?! HOW COULD PEOPLE DISLIKE THIS VIDEO?!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyobody knows who's the characters?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks great, especial the fit in with the music"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck you Marvel!
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley with no accent just ruined this movie..
CmRih_VtVAs,This has to be the greatest movie of all time. Has to be.
CmRih_VtVAs,The 9k dislikes are the people who's favourite hero is sponge bob
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm liking the looks of The Jokers toys
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool
CmRih_VtVAs,First trailer/teaser for this was way better
CmRih_VtVAs,Who are they?
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks retarded.
CmRih_VtVAs,please dont make  Harley Quinn out to be a sex symbol...she has such a deep background ;___;
CmRih_VtVAs,DC and MARVEL are completely different universes! SIMPLE! IF YOU DON’T LIKE DON’T WATCH! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Goodtrailer
CmRih_VtVAs,i like this
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Actuall looks quite good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jesus H, Scott Eastwood is a spitting image of his old man!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:47 badass
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith should say: this part of my life is called: Fu*cked up:. 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,just release the goddamn movie already
CmRih_VtVAs,There will never be such a good Joker as we had in Batman Begins.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Almost 32 million views, i'd say a good chunk of a percent is just my views alone!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just fucking love the quick shot of Harley Quinn shooting the hand gun.

CmRih_VtVAs,Seriamente necesito el nombre de la canción
CmRih_VtVAs,"Although this trailer is amazing. I just find more incredible that David Ayer managed to make Jai Courtney act, I look forward for his Cap Boomerang interpretation."
CmRih_VtVAs,In my opinion harley quinn isn't her without that sexy but slightly serious brooklyn accent😧 this will have to do
CmRih_VtVAs,come to think of this why does the joker has silver teeth instead yellow smelly teeth
CmRih_VtVAs,love the trailer but a tad early to release it don't you think
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this might top deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm way too excited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Genocide squad is now entering Europe in the millions, sponsored by Jewish companies."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,please spread -> https://www.change.org/p/youtube-terminate-nicole-arbours-youtube-channel
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like shit. Like it's trying to be a bad comedy movie. Gonna sell a lot of tickets though with hope that some horny teenage boys will see some Harley cleavage.
CmRih_VtVAs,awsome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,what is this song
CmRih_VtVAs,hooh its so nice guys
CmRih_VtVAs,counting down the days!
CmRih_VtVAs,they chose a good dong for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sure her acting will be really good but I'm afraid of the non-iconic Harley voice actually distracting me.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm just here for the mayhem
CmRih_VtVAs,my dick's hard for this trailer... Bohemian *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,ADAM BEACH
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer 2015 2016 2018 2001 2099 3015 & 3016.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really hope the actual movie has this kinda vibe and feel, something like a darker guardians of the galaxy with less corniness and less Disney."
CmRih_VtVAs,La cancion es lo mejor ❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song name that is  playing in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Vagabundo e foda mane!
CmRih_VtVAs,Yay that's i wana watch
CmRih_VtVAs,o selling same agan..dahhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rapsodhy, or whatever im not sure how to spell it"

CmRih_VtVAs,wouldn't be the same without bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of the song at the beginning?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like it'll be absolutely terrible, and like this will be the worst Harley Quinn ever done."
CmRih_VtVAs,SS isn't a comedy is it? Because it sure seems like it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Brittany Murphy would have made THE PERFECT Harley Quinn. I can see it now. She would've been fucking perfect. RIP.
CmRih_VtVAs,":04    108 let me out dog,      :52    i'm kidding that's not what they really said."
CmRih_VtVAs,One does not simply watch this once
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy sh*t that was awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,wheres kurt cobain?
CmRih_VtVAs,When Bohemian Rhapsody started playing I got a little too excited
CmRih_VtVAs,I really like this
CmRih_VtVAs,soy mexicano arriba mexico
CmRih_VtVAs,ONE OF THE BEST TRAILER I EVER SEE IN 2016 !!!! CHEERSS !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,the worst of the worst
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't be the only one here thinking this looks tacky in the extreme..
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's definitely the best trailer I've EVER seen, can't stop watching it."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG! Cara <3
CmRih_VtVAs,im i the only one that watches this trailler to hear the song
CmRih_VtVAs,They need to have poison ivy and scarecrow in this
CmRih_VtVAs,I KEEP WATCHING THIS DAILY WHY
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype is real
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,will their be a new tralier
CmRih_VtVAs,Oddly fitting track for the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie just makes me wanna bang robbie margot more. SHEESH...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a few nit-picky problems about this trailer.. Amanada Waller stated that these criminals (dead shot, Harley Quinn, Croc, Diablo, and Captian Boomerang) are the worst of the worst... When clearly Joker, Enchantress, ZOD, are/ were out there in the world.. And Isn't DC big enough to have a huge list of villians existing, especially locked away, if Batman is aged in this version?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Where are the most evil characters of TV history: The Mountain, Ramsay Bolton and Joffrey Baratheon?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank me later 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Hancock is the best.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have watched this so many time and have to say the cast much not want to kill each other :3
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,epic
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 your welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn me recuerda a Switchblade Symphony.
CmRih_VtVAs,Tobuscus brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think it's cheating editing the trailer to sync with the music, that's the easiest way to get people hyped for a movie. Still badass trailer though."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto will be an amazing Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Merlin Jean brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna know who did this queens remix
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh look. will smith is going to ruin another movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh my god, they will show how the Joker made Harley Quinn.... I'm so fucking excited."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Ben Affleck be in this movie? If so, will he be using the same batman suit that he has in Batman v Superman?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"better add more screen time for will smith,  jada pinkett might complain"
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW
CmRih_VtVAs,id watch it if they cut out joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man, everybody in this thing just looks like a bunch of tattooed up hipster douchebags. 

I'm actually saddened by how shit Leto's Joker looks, such a wet noodle of a successor to Heath Ledger's performance.

This is going to be the Big Bang Theory of superhero movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer managed to make me think 180° after watching the first one
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fuck this looks amazing!! This is my most hyped movie of 2016, looks fucking wicked. Plus they didn't completely spoil the plot like they did for BVS."
CmRih_VtVAs,More trailers!!!! 👍👍👍👍 plz!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The music is just perfectly chosen! Really good work you guys at Warner Brothers, good job! I'm now SOOOO excited I could almost forget the deadpool movie release ;P
You guys (all the cinema industry) sure know how to bring on the competition, this year is gonna be somewhat filled with madness and capes ;P"
CmRih_VtVAs,they should put this trailer a week before the movie. DC why u torture us? August is 7 months away from now.
CmRih_VtVAs,This reminds me of the Netflix series: the Arrow.. Suïcide Squad and i see slade
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that's how you make a good trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:19 como le hacen
CmRih_VtVAs,Since when was Harley Quinn ever a schizophrenic?
CmRih_VtVAs,cara is so beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I´ve watched this 100 times already... And I think I´ve paused it at 1:58 like 50 times...
CmRih_VtVAs,i want to watch it only cuz Viola Davis
CmRih_VtVAs,"the children had fun, now it is the turn to adults"
CmRih_VtVAs,Eat shit Disney. EAT IT!
CmRih_VtVAs,One more small step down for American culture.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will and viola are gonna make this the best movie
CmRih_VtVAs,A B S O L U T E M A D M A N T B P H
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked this trailer. They didn't reveal too much and now I really wanna see this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"After watching both this and the Batman v Superman trailer, I think the murdering psychopath villains might be the only likeable characters in this cinematic universe so far"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the guy that's like a young 70's Clint Eastwood?!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57  Is that Joker and Harley in the Ace Chemical vat? Are they using Harley's backstory from New 52?
CmRih_VtVAs,WORST....JOKER....EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley's bubbly pop at 1:53 turned me on a bit too much.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love DC and Marvel but seriously this movie already won me over by putting Slipknot in it mainly because I LOVE the band surprisingly i have never heard of him before this movie i knew everyone else but him
CmRih_VtVAs,If this and that dead pool film turn out to have shit plots or cinimatography I'll cry.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling this will be Rated R but if it is PG-13 it looks pretty violent but anyways ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, I think this was an absolutely fantastic trailer and it looks like it going to great, but did anyone else think that Harley's jokes were just really cringeworthy? I can see she tried to sell them but... eeeeeh... they were pretty bad."
CmRih_VtVAs,YESSSSSS! I loved it the second I heard the song. Who is singing along?
CmRih_VtVAs,Squad goals
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can already see all those ""edgy"" girls imitating Harley Quinn because they think it's cute... ugh... movie looks good though, kinda glad they're bringing some comic book ideas in it"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer reminds me of Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,Caraaaa😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone tell me the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,tbh I'm only excited for Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone tell me the song/soundtrack plz?
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone tell me the song/soundtrack plz?
CmRih_VtVAs,"what does the ""crazy"" girl actully do"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG! me urge que estrene esta película
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker and Harley Quinn are going to be fun to watch.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really like how at the end of the trailer when Harley is stealing that purse right next to it is a shirt that says....""Si Vis Pacem Prepara Bellum"" which is Latin and translated it means....'If you want peace, prepare for war."" Really symbolic when you think about it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Prepare to cry as The Joker ruins this film with amazing potential.
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason I wanna see this movie is HARLEY QUINN ♥♥♥ !!! Well ok not the only reason but the major one :p
CmRih_VtVAs,here is the thing I'm super hyped but were is Deathstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,"people that dislike this, GO TO HELL!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Brutal.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This has got the same amount of views as the first one within one week! Impressive, most impressive."
CmRih_VtVAs,oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy!!! hahahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats that song called when joker jumped?
CmRih_VtVAs,"when Harley quinn bends over, comic book fan boys all over the world shot there fat. LOL."
CmRih_VtVAs,The Oscars is the bad guy!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who's a little disappointed Harleys voices doesn't have that southern twang from the 90's cartoons?
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anybody else see Emma Watson?
CmRih_VtVAs,"'WORST HEROES EVER'

I think part of an Avengers trailer got mixed in with this..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"So much people on these comments are talking so much shit about this movie and it hasn't even came out yet! How about you wait for the movie to come out watch it, then you can talk shit if you want! "
CmRih_VtVAs,I love that trailer with song can't stop watching 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,nice
CmRih_VtVAs,worst trailer ever c
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is fucking awesome and that song isn't too shabby either, I know it's from Queen but what's the song name?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if Margot Robbie will use old Harley Quinn's voice because it sounded like she didn't which I disappointing :( But I can't wait for this film looks amazing !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,when is the FNAF trailer ganna come out?????
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is going to ruin Arrow, they already had to kill off Amanda Waller because of this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it August yet? :P
CmRih_VtVAs,"MAMA, JUST KILLED A MAN :("
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm I the only one that is really obsessed with this Joker even if the movie hasn't came out yet?
CmRih_VtVAs,same
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks like a cool movie, but my prob is the Killer Croc. He looked a little bit small."
CmRih_VtVAs,"They got me on Bohemian Rhapsody but I just have to ask: Why is every superhero movie half-comedy? Not that it bothers me, plus this is quite a new and refreshing thing for the oh-so-dark-DC, but I'm just curious"
CmRih_VtVAs,come on guys this not even the real suicide squad in the real story they save the joker on the Arkham Asylum
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name pls?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love D.C
But Jered Leto was a bad choice. I know i'll get so much hate for saying this. Joker looks more like a serial killer here , than a crazy clown."
CmRih_VtVAs,the hell??!!! why does this shit look like an action- comedy  movie trailer -_- .....
CmRih_VtVAs,Spoilers... Jar Jar is a powerful sith lord
CmRih_VtVAs,1:29 Joker *WITHOUT* tattoos
CmRih_VtVAs,me encanta este trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Why Queen?¡¡¡Why?¡¡¡
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else keeps thinking Captain Boomerang is Tom Hardy but realises its Jai Courtenay?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, Harley gets to be with her pumpkin !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Still upset that Harley's colors is red and blue and her voice is different
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, Harley, the voices in MY head are tellin' me that your performance in this movie will make the viewer cry. BLOOD."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't fucking wait to see this!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen made this trailer 20x better :) BUT FINALLY DC COMICS IS GETTING SOME RECOGNITION AM I RIGHT? FUCK MARVEL (my opinion pls no attack me) YAY FOR DC
CmRih_VtVAs,Wheres Batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks amazing, I can't belive this is real."
CmRih_VtVAs,love the ending...
CmRih_VtVAs,"AWSOME, THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT. and the best thing is that the trailer didn't show too much."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Don't get me wrong I love Jared Leto and his joker and this movie. But I feel weird watching the dark, eerie first trailer and then this. It just gives me a weird feeling in my gut"
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker's the only one I'm buying so far
CmRih_VtVAs,I kinda wish Harley Quinns actor voice was more like the original Harley Quinn but I will get over it haha Can't wait to see this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,pardon my french here but fuck yes and just take my money already
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody makes everything perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer I've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than the Deadpool trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg this looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg this trailer is so fricking awsome, i cant wait for movie to come"
CmRih_VtVAs,sowhatthefuckdoesharleyquinndobutsuckjokersdickandlooklikesheknowshowtoswingabat???
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here for cara😂😊❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys hahahahhahahahahah that is funny so going to see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,tbh I was really excited for this movie but it looks like a 13 year old emo kid's wet dream
CmRih_VtVAs,The Comic con trailer had more intensity and this one had more of a comedic feel..Still cannot wait to see it nonetheless...
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker Harley and deadshot... deadly combination wahahahahaaa!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think so Harley will steal this film. Joker seems to be boring on this trailer ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's watched this like 50 times already?
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see Joker with an RPG in his hand trying to blow up one of those choppers!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith as Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,cannot freaking wait
CmRih_VtVAs,I was interested in this movie until I saw the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Vincent Van Gogh brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley has no accent that kinda defines her, and otherwise seems like some typical blonde schoolgirl trying way too hard to be funny. Like they weren't quite sure how she would act so they just thought ""Make her crazy and have her say random things"".

The Joker looks like a hipster. Like some Joker fanboy who just happens to look like a crackhead and dyed his hair green because he likes the joker so much.

Will Smith looks way too emotional, like his role is going to detract from everyone else because he's so extremely serious and emotional like he's the only one who has a real plot.

The other guys scream a lot. And that's about all the character I see."
CmRih_VtVAs,
CmRih_VtVAs,JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! WHO THE FUCK IS GONNA WAIT UNTIL AUGUST! FUCK!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who's more hyped for this than Batman v Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks sick as fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie really looks promising, Joker is bad ass"
CmRih_VtVAs,im so hype about this trailer!! ...and just 1 Question.... who are they gonna fight?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why couldn't Margot Robbie research Harley's accent? She practically did her accent in Wolf of Wallstreet just more mellow. I know that's such a menial thing to be bothered about, but its Harley fuckin Quinn! She has one of the most distinguishable voices in the entire Batman series. She's nailed the persona, and the movie still looks amazing. Just gonna be weird not hearing her accent."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 oh
CmRih_VtVAs,The only good dc movie #marvel4life
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought this would be about Burnley Football Clubs Suicide Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't understand anything from this trailer -_-
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will smith, bohemian rhapsody, and the suicide squad I. One movie, HOLY GRAP
I can't wait"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 would put my tongue between those cheeks
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think that Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn in the right way. She looks dumb and crazy but I think she is more like a psychopath
CmRih_VtVAs,"FUCK i watched this trailer like 10 times and i still get chills when i hear 'Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia' Freddie Mercurie was a god...."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Something tells me that will smith begged to be on this movie to be relevant
CmRih_VtVAs,i have a bad feeling about this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,August 3rd 😭😭😭😭 I can't wait anymore !
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie will be self-aware, uncompromising and possibly the most pleasant surprise in a year full of SUPERblockbusters."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm on board. My only hesitation is that this Joker looks a bit milquetoast. We'll see.
CmRih_VtVAs,queen me trouxe aq
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Disney-Marvel movies in danger
CmRih_VtVAs,most ppl think this is the original joker and its not! robin turns into a form of joker thats why on bat vs super u see robins costume and it says the jokes on you. he turned into joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,31 Million views in just one week
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF AUGUST I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG
CmRih_VtVAs,Boomerang getting out of the bag and dropping the one guy with a one punch haha
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks like a lesbian :/
CmRih_VtVAs,"look at 2:03 it looks like only harley, deadshot the commader and the nija women survive"
CmRih_VtVAs,Love this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"🎶""So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye""🎶 *Shows Deadshot 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope the movie starts off with the Batman chasing down Joker and Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one whos not interested in the movie anymore?!!
CmRih_VtVAs,When did you watch this video(all of you)
CmRih_VtVAs,sorry guys I'm gonna end up masturbating to Harley Queen throughout the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,is that christian bale at 0:59?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm here only for joker
CmRih_VtVAs,guys i forgot the song title will you help me?
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Boomerang and Katana mentioned at all? I saw them but like mention them at least
CmRih_VtVAs,"well well well

CmRih_VtVAs,"bad ass song for the movie,🙌QUEEN"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I glad that they,ve taken an evil camp slant on the characters just as DC villians should be portrayed . Harks back to Batman 60s tv series good job DC !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Politi
CmRih_VtVAs,my goodness. what a great time to be a DC/Marvel fan. ❤ 
CmRih_VtVAs,It's Cara <3
CmRih_VtVAs,IS THIS THE REAL LIFE?
CmRih_VtVAs,"There is an animation movie regarding this that has been out for a while.  It's really good too! Check it out people!  Same type of story line script (looks the same actually).  DC Comics/Warner Bros. made that one too.  I forgot the name of it though (same name I think?). Please forgive me, I watch A LOT of imported subtitled ANIME!  PEACE People!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see jarred letto as the joker like he has to be one of the coolest and plays the character better then anyone has before
CmRih_VtVAs,"damn
 perfect song for the movie lol.. cant wait to watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,August? Fucking August? Fucking thing looks done to me. Roll it.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,The marketing for suicide squad is way better than batman v superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,agelopoulos giati patria out Glikia
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like an acid trip of a cluster fuck movie, think the ppl who made this movie misunderstood fun & cool (like Deadpool) for cartoonish & forced."
CmRih_VtVAs,ok real talk. Whos gonna die first in the movie??
CmRih_VtVAs,was that cara delevigne?
CmRih_VtVAs,was th
CmRih_VtVAs,not bad. thanks for the song

CmRih_VtVAs,scott eastwood gonna be nightwing or nay.?
CmRih_VtVAs,freddy mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,C'MON. OUTSTANDING EFFORW! ATTEMPT HOP ! 11
CmRih_VtVAs,Jury's still out on this one. It could go either way. Only time will tell.
CmRih_VtVAs,http://igg.me/at/MX-hobHw4Jw/x/13270827 Hey everybody! Take a look on our campaign!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is awesome, good use of bohemian rhapsody"
CmRih_VtVAs,actually screaming
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can we just be real about the people complaining about the way Harley is portrayed in this? Margot Robbie has done a voice that's both fun, makes you aware it's Harley, and won't annoy you for 2 hours. In Arkham Knight, everyone was complaining about how Tara Strong's squeaky Harley voice was the worst thing ever. Robbie brought charisma and charm in these scenes and she's going to blow every actor away with this performance. Have faith people!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"what a great bgm,...
movie in august...cant wait...
Rip freedie mercury"
CmRih_VtVAs,Terrible Song for a trailer like this. Shoulda used something more dark/mystical
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith should not be playing deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,where the fuck is mr freeze?
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song  between 1:42 n 1:55😁😁😁😁i really need to know
CmRih_VtVAs,incluso Freddie Mercury sigue reinando en nuetra era!!!!! ..... #besttrailerever
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Sent shivers down my spine"" describes what I felt when I watch this"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey, that looks pretty good...
Margot Robbie I mean, the movie has the potential to flop and drop like old people with polio"
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:28 , no tattos , and diferent smile. 2:03 tattos , other smile in the car with harley and batman is above the car.(batman in the present?????"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker with no tattoos, grill or scars plus different makeup 1:29"
CmRih_VtVAs,Boomerang is real MVP
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know about you guys, but this trailer seems pretty DAMAGED. 

For fuck's sake, that tattoo..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anybody even know half of the members in the group? I mean we all know Crock and Harley but the others I just want to make sure where they fit in the DC Universe.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not a good enough reason to use Bohemian Rhapsody, sorry"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:07 They remove Bismillah in this song ~
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is everyone in denial about how dumb this looks
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley is cute, Deadshot is a badass, Killer Croc is fine, Kitana is Kitana, Boomerang is really edgy, Enchantress is a creepy Satan spawn, and the Joker is crazy as fuck.....

This is going to be DC's best movie this year!"
CmRih_VtVAs,what happens to will smith?ever since he got that mopey look his movie usually suck
CmRih_VtVAs,"People need to back off Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Over the years there have been SO MANY different versions of Harley Quinn, sporting different looks and each with it's own personality. People like Heath Ledger's Joker from Nolan's trilogy because it was an original take on Joker. Now let Margot Robbie surprise you with her incarnation. As they say: don't judge a book by it's cover."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Slipknot and Boomerang: starts beating the shit out of people when they get released
Harley Quinn: ""Hey boysssss""
Can't wait for this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,"After this trailer, I am not looking forward to this movie now. Don't know why, but maybe it's because I don't like the cast, (no Heath Ledger), and it sounds like they just took a good song, and put it in just because they can, and the only relation that it has with the movie is that it is someone going to prison. I'll still see it though, I mean, its D.C so it can't be bad right, I mean, when has there ever been a bad D.C movie? (obvious sarcasm is obvious)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more of a marvel guy but I'm more exited for this then X-man apocalypse
CmRih_VtVAs,YA QUIERO VERLAAAAAAA😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,0:59 Latino Christian Bale
CmRih_VtVAs,Good trailer this movie looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love Marvel but, they just wet their pants"
CmRih_VtVAs,is it cara??!!! o.o
CmRih_VtVAs,WIll Smith is going to ruin Deadshot.  Might as well rename the character Deadshit.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43-1:44 is that groot?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"can someone please tell me, is the joker a bad guy or good guy in this movie? I know he is a bad guy in the normal things, just wondering"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a shit show.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like the song, can't wait to see it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian raphsody bro
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect song for a PERFECT movie!!!! Damn so excited!!! Why August 5th why!?????
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be great
CmRih_VtVAs,shit Trailer! shit cinema!
CmRih_VtVAs,People are talking shit about a movie that isnt even out...
CmRih_VtVAs,It's very interesting seeing the joker dive into that pit of goop to get Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"I so badly want to be pumped up about this movie,, but I just have a bad feelings it's gonna be garbage.. I hope I'm wrong. Had the exact feeling when daredevil came out"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 The Joker is probably saving Harley's life.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen a tope
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only thing they shouldn't say is 
""the most dangerous ppl on the planet"" cause there are way stronger Villains in the dc roster, like doomsday for example"
CmRih_VtVAs,sick I love harly and the joker looks really crazy and you got Will Smith in there!
CmRih_VtVAs,El Diablo is hot af
CmRih_VtVAs,the music fucked this completely up my goodness
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love this song and it fits well with the movie because people think that the song was about suicide and or murder, but it's highly believed that it's about Freddy Mercury coming out. so does it really fit?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else see the heart around Harley Quinn and the Joker when the joker is holding Harley while she's in the acid?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Daddy, slay me."
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I think slip knot may die i dont know
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,The song when you sing up for musically and baby Ariel pops up with her familiy🤔😭

CmRih_VtVAs,Deadshot is nigga?
CmRih_VtVAs,;-; fANTASTIC
CmRih_VtVAs,please subscribe !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like Jared Leto's acting from what I've seen so far and I like the look they gave the Joker. I'm not sure I love Harley Quinn, but we will see. I think the movie will be great regardless. The first trailer that was released (which most definitely is not this) was truly masterful."
CmRih_VtVAs,My gods are you kidding me people are actually asking what the song is.What has the world come to!!Its Queen!!! Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,im so hyped omgggg
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC comics and Bohemian Rhapsody, whats not to love?❤❤❤"
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so fucking ready for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nice to see DC making a fun movie for a change. It's just ironic that this movie would seem so lighthearted and fun, while their main superhero movies are so lifeless and boring."
CmRih_VtVAs,August 5th I have to wait that long!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,To bad Will smith is in this.
CmRih_VtVAs,That joker laugh is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did you notice in the minute 1:29 Joker has not the Damaged's tatoo in his face, and has a painted smile like Nicholson's joker?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"My theory about the Harley/Joker acid bath scene: If you look closely at them, you can see their clothes are disintegrating, and colors are floating around them. Now, with the initial reaction to the Joker's tattoos being so negative, I think that acid bath is going to erase all their tattoos. Just my random theory."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im coming to terms with the fact that people dont know the name of the song. But why are they asking when they can just ""Shazam"" it?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Man I can't wait to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,Will you entertain?
CmRih_VtVAs,one of them looks like jinx... >->
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is for us to pause it at lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bad guys are trying to save the world. Interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Sorry, it's the voices. I'm kidding! Haha...that's not what they really said."""
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm Australian so the only reason I wanna watch this is cos of Captain Boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,Could use more female 'heroes' though.
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard this movie is based on a true story.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Apart from Joker's excessive tattoos which he would look 10x scarier without, and Harley's horrible outfit design, I'm actually pretty hyped for this.

+1000 points for using Bohemian Rhaspody"
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont know why people get hyped about this... its just one more shitty movie wtf.  sorry not sorry
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide squad: featuring will smith, Jinx, Renekton, Brand, Diana and more!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Futuro fracaso es más comprometedor batman vs superman veo luz en esa película
CmRih_VtVAs,LITERAL Suicide Squad Trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 tattooed man?
CmRih_VtVAs,Naaaa me da asco la peli solo con ver la mujer
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto making the joker look sweet!
CmRih_VtVAs,harley's costume is terrible. she looks like a slut
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fucking great
CmRih_VtVAs,"After 41 years, Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody lives on... What can I say!!! I'm pleased..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is looking worse by the second. WB just can't do trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,Wannabe guardians of the galaxy but with deadpool humor 
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this movie set in the same universe as Batman vs Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,"9k dislikes wow, i think they isis"
CmRih_VtVAs,Love it.....Can't wait to see  it......
CmRih_VtVAs,"I´m so hoping, that this movie will be awesome, and it does have some things going for it, that make me cautiously optimistic, but it does starr Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney, who have both ruined every franchise, they´ve been put into (I´m convinced, that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sequel never happened, because Joel Kinnaman jinxt it), so I really hope their bad jubies sort of cancel each other out."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why are there so many DC and MARVEL disputes in the comment sections, I'm personally a fan of both and I'm just like wtf? Is there anyone that is hyped for BOTH, Deadpool AND Suicide Squad?﻿"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys."" The guy he said that to…his haircut looked kinda like Robins' in the comics…"
CmRih_VtVAs,hype af
CmRih_VtVAs,"When I saw wolf of wallstreet I though Wow this girl looks like Harley I'm still surprised that the directors of this movie thought the same thing. 

I think she's gonna be a great Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Personally I am excited for this movie; it's different, it's dark, it's funny and it's just unique. Seems like it will be very enjoyable to watch"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Usually, as I am dull, I wait for movies to come out as DVDs so I can watch them at home with all the comfort. For this movie I'll do an exception. I can't wait to see Leto's Joker, Harley Quinn (my favourite female character), Delevingne as Enchantress. Oh, and by watching this trailer I believe this movie is going to be amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,i wish they had chosen better fitted actors and taken the movie more seriously.
CmRih_VtVAs,it's just getting better and better every time I see it...and it's just the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,my Body is so ready for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so excited for Captain America : Civil War motherfuckers
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet Enchantress and Slipknot will die
CmRih_VtVAs,Favorite character hancock
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorta disappointed in those who are bashing this film before even seeing it, simply because they don't like the jokers design. tut tut."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Each new trailer makes this movie look less and less interesting. Putting a timeless amazing song on it only makes the movie less credible. However I of course plan to go see the movie hoping the the best.
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC's Guardians of the Galaxy. 

Which is great, 'cause GotG is aweeeeeeesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,I like Harley she looks crazy and sexy but in the other hand the Joker is a bit off or maybe I just love ledger too much.
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally Will  Smith is in a movie again.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wish I was alive to see this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"What was that ?!  what is the name of that song ? ...sorry the ignorants ,haha i'm kidding  (i hope) that's not what they really said"
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddy Mercury brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,spanihs?? :(
CmRih_VtVAs,let me tell you one time again THIS JOKER SUCKSSSSSSS.
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,Tbh only want to see this movie for some Joker and Harley Quinn interactions❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,Hayley quinn looks like that girl from my name is earl
CmRih_VtVAs,DC IS AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,Much better than batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"life brought me here.

CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 that would so be me
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rapsody- Queen. Thank me later song forgetting young people pricks
CmRih_VtVAs,bitches
CmRih_VtVAs,will Smith the only Smith with talent.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks slipknot is badass. I adore the characters that dont get that much attention.
CmRih_VtVAs,No its not
CmRih_VtVAs,tbh I think this is gonna do better than BvS wish it didn't but it is
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wrong song choice for this trailer. It makes it look like a goofy comedy. This is meant to be dark and gritty, not like fucking Antman"
CmRih_VtVAs,why did they copy the joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Every time I start getting interested in this movie, the Joker shows up and ruins it.  They just had to make him look like some try-hard wannabe auditioning for Joker's gang.  Can't take him seriously at all.  At least they did a good job with Harley.

Awesome trailer, though.  Good use of the Rhapsody."
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is going to bring back the ""scene kids"" I feel...."
CmRih_VtVAs,I want the song name please
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please, what the name of the song ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im gonna order the latest superheroes trailers we see. To the best to the worst.

CmRih_VtVAs,Why is it so far away 😭😭 xx
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish she said ""Yatzie"" in this trailer haha"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like how the bleeding colors when Joker brings Harvey out of the acid (?) create a heart. Oh yeah, and the rest of the trailer was fucking awesome too..."
CmRih_VtVAs,CRAZY Movie! pufffff i need this
CmRih_VtVAs,"stop at 2:05

Good feeling broo"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 :^)
CmRih_VtVAs,THE JOKER FLIPINN' SCARED ME!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,i don't mean it's bad or anything but this movie is gonna destroy everything i grew up reading ;(
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm seeing this for my birthday (August 19) 2 weeks after it comes out
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you know this is one of the best movies ever. I don't really like DC and I don't know half of the people in this thing but I still want to watch it. Really really badly!
CmRih_VtVAs,"And yet no one mentions the queen of 9GAG:
Emma Watson"
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone recommend some  comics with joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fucking shit !!!!!!! AWESOME !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow so good of this trailer to promote smaller musicians by using their songs
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks so good
CmRih_VtVAs,I just knew Will Smith wouldn't use the dead shot mask for long in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Pack your bags Marvel kids.
CmRih_VtVAs,@We bad guys it`s what we do!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker is the bad guy!! sorry not sorry for spoiler
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else wanna fuck the crazy out of that bitch?
CmRih_VtVAs,If this was a video game I would play it
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker looks like a hipster wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so good. joker looks just as promising as ledger (RIP).
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect movie for 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Man dc is going to kick marvels butt!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:51 What's this? Is Alex Mercer finaly free again?
CmRih_VtVAs,that ass 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst. Heroes. Ever.

CmRih_VtVAs,awesome trailer !! although I really don't like will smith I might just put it aside and watch the movie ... :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Lost it at 1:35 xD Perfectly pitched en timed!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, if you're going to ask ""what's the song"" on THIS video, I am going to answer Darude- Sandstorm. Don't make me do that, ok? Ok."
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone agree with me that Jared Leto can give Heath L a run for his money on the joker character.....
CmRih_VtVAs,What's going on with Joker's shoulders at 1:58?
CmRih_VtVAs,"So Will Smith is Deadshot. This is his third role (by my count there may be more) playing a character that in any other media is white. Jim West, Robert Neville, and now Floyd Lawton. Everyone is ok with it, even though a white person playing a black character would be the most racist thing ever and would be met with outrage and front page headlines for months until the project was scrapped or the actor recast. But yea he should boycott the Oscars for the way he and other black people are being treated...."
CmRih_VtVAs,El mejor trailer jamas realizado!! la cancion es perfecta!
CmRih_VtVAs,What age is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen goes good with this.
CmRih_VtVAs,PERFECTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like cheap trash, sure to be a success then...."

CmRih_VtVAs,El diablo is a sexy guy ahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,here for Delevingne 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,here for Delevingne 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pourquoi tant de vue pour un film aussi brouillon , aucune histoire, aucune moral , se film n'éprouve rien... Donc pourquoi tant de visionnage , alors que des chef d'oeuvres comme Black Mass n'atteigne pas les 10 M de visionnage ... Personnellement je trouve ses trailers à chier (et le film) , ils ont tout jouer sur les personnages , tous des personnages interprétés par des acteurs connus mais sinon dans l'ensemble l'histoire pue la d'aube"
CmRih_VtVAs,well that was boringmore hype for civil war and batman v superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, i understand that Obama bring the biblical end."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide squat. Wait, I mean suicide squad. ummmm, nvm, suicide squat it is."
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you guys don't know the song playing, may God bless your soul"
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,who else wants the old joker back?
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see how King Shark fits into this movie! He's rumored to be in it!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07

CmRih_VtVAs,Hmm... Let's face it suicide squad deadshot copying pewsiepie I mean arrow
CmRih_VtVAs,look at harley's shirt: Daddys lil monster
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still a little disappointed that Captain Boomerang doesn't have a ridiculously exaggerated Australian accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so seeing this !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot still the worst thing in this film & this entire year of film. And why the fuck are they focusing on her so much? Why is she waling out with them? Her main quality was her craziness not brawling with people or hitting them with a bat.
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury and Queen brought me here :)
CmRih_VtVAs,What an awesome time to be alive for superhero movies. Cannot wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,love love love this trailer!!! who edited this?? looks amazing!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"i really exicited

CmRih_VtVAs,this is amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,I've seen this about 50 times and it hasn't stopped being entertaining. It's such perfection and I love it so much ❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope the movie FLOPS!!! Will Smith is a RACIST!! Then you can think twice before working with a nasty racist asshole
CmRih_VtVAs,"so, they are heroes?"
CmRih_VtVAs,omg I'm in love!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley doesn't even have that cute voice she had :(
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't believe there are almost 9000 thumbs down. I guess you really can't please everyone. This was one of the best trailers I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,#worstherosever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, before I watch this, is this trailer like Batman v Superman trailer which pretty much spoiled the entire movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is the best trailer suicide squad look awesome

CmRih_VtVAs,"Dafauq is wrong with  some ppl comparing Batman V Superman & Suicide Squad ? Their both WB/DC movies , Batman in Suicide squad. Why can""t you  just watch both"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does Will Smith want an Oscar for this shit? He's kidding! His talented children will be ashamed of him!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of Cara's role?
CmRih_VtVAs,Mistah J looks great !
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's been only ten days and the trailer already has 30 million views.. *__*

CmRih_VtVAs,Cara <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith as Deadshot has to be the stupidest fucking casting idea ever

and i'm so fucking sick and tired of modern day Joker being portrayed as a goddamn edgelord

like laying in the middle of a circle of knives how goddamn edgy can you be? I expect joker to be a villain with physical comedy and gigantic goofy but dangerous props with more witty dark humor than just trying to appeal to people who get wet over the idea of ""bad ass wow cuts himself and lays in knives""

fucking disgusting"
CmRih_VtVAs,мальчик подпишитесь кому не трудно ) уледные видео у меня на канале)
CmRih_VtVAs,2:09 Call of Duty 4 SFX am I the only one to recognise it ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im curious to see killer croc, joker, harley, then deadshot, everyone else look cool too.  But in these trailers I'm always trying to see croc, bad ass batman villain, whom I'm guessing gets cut down by katana"
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE!! Btw what is the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,hey guys what is the name on the song i know its queen but what is the name ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'M SO IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE, OMGOMGOMGOGOMG!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is deadshot black
CmRih_VtVAs,MY theory is that the joker car scene that was shown to have batman on top of the car through leaked on set footage is backstory to how Harly Quinn got caught
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm excccciiitedd
CmRih_VtVAs,"AWESOME TRAILER

HAIL QUEEN!"

CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone seen the Suicide Squad animation on Netflix? Some scenes are directly in this movie lol..
CmRih_VtVAs,0:20 so why isn't Donald Trump in this?
CmRih_VtVAs,You know you got a good movie on ur hands when you don't have to show us again that Batman is in this as well
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'd like to know which book is which is reading Harley in the first part. If anyone knows, please tell me"
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,I think DC might have the better comic book movies of 2016 over Fox and Marvel...SO HAPPY TO BE ALIVE FOR ALL OF THIS THOUGH
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this film to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Ooookaayyyy.... I've seen the preview pictures. Harley Quinn looks like a Emelie Autumn stripper, Joker looks like a brat boy, I'm not updated on this story at all..I'm doubtful of this...""

CmRih_VtVAs,That Harley is hot AF
CmRih_VtVAs,song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,Already looks way better than SupermanVSBatman Dawn of Justice
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a very strong feeling that Jared Leto is going to play an amazing Joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nice. Well, right up until the point where she breaks the window, bends over and it's like were back in the Stone Age again. Who came up with that shot? Michael Bay? Ben Dover? Pathetic."
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO EXCITED PLEASE AIRED ON CINEMA ALREADY
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here from Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,So excited because of harley quin !
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie doesn't look very good, what exactly is this meant to be about? I get the impression that it is a lame movie with a bunch of obvious jokes that satirize superhero fiction. Or is it just shitty parody, I get those two confused sometimes."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks AMAZING. Was ruined by the song though.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone have a guess as to who the bad guys they're fighting in this movie? They look like tree/leaf people kind of. Maybe they're trying to get a hold of Poison Ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto as joker.. orgasm
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything so perfect ...
CmRih_VtVAs,I like this video just because BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
CmRih_VtVAs,no need to go to the theater..that was the whole movie right there
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am not the biggest fan of Jai Courtney, but he might just be the best thing in this trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,when the girl said were bad guys its wut we do i completely cracked up XDDD
CmRih_VtVAs,quinn sipping coffee...even those calm movements are so scary
CmRih_VtVAs,"What is Civil War?? What is Disney ...I mean.. Marvel? 

Thank You DC for BVS and SS ;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Make DC good again...
CmRih_VtVAs,<3 Harley Quinn solo movie please!
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy best trailer of 2016 Batman!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 daaamn son that is worth the entire video.
CmRih_VtVAs,30M
CmRih_VtVAs,"This actual looks half way decent. Aside from some terrible and almost terrible casting choices (Will Smith and almost Oprah), Deadshots awful costume, and Jared Letos attempt at a Heath Ledger Joker voice this looks like it will be a fun movie. Of course Harley looks hot which sells it for me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hasn't this premise been done before, many times before? Just change the characters and Hollywood thinks this will fly, huh? Does anyone in Hollywood have an original idea or is it all been boiled down to formula? Have my answer but more astounded that Hollywood doesn't let in new blood because there is plenty of it. Their and our loss. Nepotism has its price."
CmRih_VtVAs,worst joker ever they simply killd his personality
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 You're welcome. We all paused at this moment

CmRih_VtVAs,"There's no such thing as the best Joker, only your most favourite one"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this trailer im soooooo excited for da movie
CmRih_VtVAs,baddest joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Super hyped fam. Love suicide squad and I think they finna do a dope job on this movie. (Better than batman v superman trailer).
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see Jared Leto play joker and I think he'll do a bad ass job. It's a little bit different but that's not really a bad thing I mean in this trailer he seems to have that comic book feel but still keepin it a lil bit fresh. And yah I think Margot Robbie is gon be an amazing Harley Quinn. She looks kinda like the new 52 version but not really (that's not bad thing.) them people that be sayin that she sounds and acts annoying are the people that don't like the character. She is pretty much the same Harley we love just a little bit more realistic and new. She doesn't have the accent we know her for but that's ok to me because she still kinda has that Harley voice but just a little bit different. Y'all entitled to your opinion but for those who just hate on it just to hate on it have no life and don't know how to just chill and let it sink in the movie is happening get over it. If u don't like that's cool but don't think everyone should have the same fuckin opinion.
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain Boomerang aka Jai Courtney looks identical to Tom Hardy
CmRih_VtVAs,so far I see a rip off joker and harly quin
CmRih_VtVAs,"Odd song choice. I'm disappointed Harley Quinn doesn't have a Staten Island accent, but then again I'll be forever disappointed that Brittany Murphy will never get to play her. Looks like a fun movie, though."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Odd song choice. I'm disappointed Harley Quinn doesn't have a Staten Island accent, but then again I'll be forever disappointed that Brittany Murphy will never get to play her. Looks like a fun movie, though."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this looks aggressive and cool in the same time.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this looks aggressive and cool in the same time
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is a racists pile of shit
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 Dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool Vs Joker. Why not? (The world burn) :D
CmRih_VtVAs,too bad its pg 13
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait long enough for this movie. i love this an batman v superman so much i made my own combined trailer of the two and it actually is my first good video. But seriously margot robbie is gonna make a good harley quinn! Also if you read about Jared Leto he is going to be an amazing joker. he took he role so seriously he never went out of character and will smith said he felt like he never met jared xD
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait!I want to see that movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I would go see this this BUT Will Smith is in it so I'll pass.

CmRih_VtVAs,who the hell would dislike this trailer!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, this is a movie more than worth watching."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why i have a feeling that this movie gonna turn out like marvel based movie ??? ....
CmRih_VtVAs,SUICIDE SQUAD?? MORE LIKE MARK WAHLBERG TEACHING HIS KIDS TO TALK!!!! YEAH BABY!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm boycotting all Will Smith movie's. He used to be my favorite actor and now he's a whiny bitch. You don't like white people and your the racist. Jadda stinks isn't getting watched no more either losers.
CmRih_VtVAs,It bested the last Batman V Superman trailer WOAH
CmRih_VtVAs,8000 people don't have a brain
CmRih_VtVAs,They guy at 31 seconds was smiling the whole time while he hits him and flushes another out with water XD I think hes having too much fun lol
CmRih_VtVAs,1:51 was that prototype?
CmRih_VtVAs,"They finally let Queen into a movie trailer and they did it in a beautiful way. Doesn't the crazy girl remind you of one of the American idol contestants or phoebe from freinds? I don't know, but can't wait to c this movie with my comic class"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see Joker toys.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the first trailer in a long time that I've watched so many times. Very well done, can't wait to see the movie!"

Deathstroke-esque silhouette on the police car next to Deadshot. May be too much of an assumption, but it's there."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ehh.. Idk
CmRih_VtVAs,How long as it been since Will Smith was in a good movie?  I remember when he was the box office king.  I hope this one the Prince is Fresh again!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see all the girls dress up as harley quinn for halloween.. and the movie of course.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like this is either going to be either ""meh"" or excellent. The PG-13 rating has me worried it won't be as dark as it should and will have a bunch of stuff to appeal to younger audiences, which is fine, but is rarely done well (e.g. Jar Jar Binks)."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wonder who has the best accuracy between Deadshot, Deadpool, and Deathstroke."
CmRih_VtVAs,go sucide .squad..m eager to watch
CmRih_VtVAs,Badguy Guardians of the Galaxy?

CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 one of my favorite parts of the trailer (look carefully btw)
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Will Ferrel at 0:26 yelling? Lol sounds just like him. OPEN DA GATE
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dont get me wrong , Heath Ledger was incredible and i dont want to take away from that but if you go into this movie negative on the leto joker because of the ledger joker your gonna ruin the movie for yourself just go in positve on this new joker.. Plus he looks pretty bad ass, and well done"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, Jared Leto certainly has the mouth to play the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is an R rated movie, right? For titties and violence? They're bad guys."
CmRih_VtVAs,What was that thing in the train.?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"Much better then I expected, it looks like DC's answer to Guardians of the galaxy."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer is amazing, but Harley Quinn looks like she's going to be the stereotypically dumb and annoying blonde."
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOME ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,COOOOOOL!! can't wait to watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,What if... the subway monster is Braniac?
CmRih_VtVAs,what song?

CmRih_VtVAs,No wonder this batman went crazy
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching
CmRih_VtVAs,Robbie looks like she's gonna be an amazing Haley Quinn and leto as joker is starting to grow on me
CmRih_VtVAs,literally this movie is the only reason I need to stay alive
CmRih_VtVAs,all you guys are wrong its not the acting or format of the movie that's going to kill it. it's you expectation of what it's going to be that's going to ruin it
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie mercury brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit, they ruined the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 what a cheeky skrub
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so damn ready for this movie

CmRih_VtVAs,im a bit afraid for this movie. it comes out in august and most action or hero movies that come out late summer tend to be bad. I hope its because 2016 has a shit load of comic book movies and no one wants to compete but august ruins it.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto is a good actor, but as time goes on it seems his acting is becoming more and more forced. Like, he looks like he's trying too hard to be a bad guy in this movie. He has a lot to live up to, like cesar romero, jack nicholson, and heath ledger before him.  This looks like a good movie, but I honestly think Jared Leto will ruin the authenticity of it for me. To each their own I guess."

CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad trailer full of random shit on which they edited a freaking Queen song that doesn't fit it at all?? Keep your hands off of Queen and make a better trailer DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Well mark me down for scared and horny!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,the last trailer was so sad ;( BUT THIS IS FUCKING BLOWING MY MIND
CmRih_VtVAs,You either jack off and go to sleep or you stay awake long enough to see yourself jack off again.
CmRih_VtVAs,this was published on my birthday!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,that song was gay
CmRih_VtVAs,that song was gay
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol the part when she smashed the window for the bag , that's so me"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC fanboys are the worst fanbase
CmRih_VtVAs,Greatest trailer of the year so far! An assemble super villain film is what we need! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok I'll be honest, this looks better than Batman v Superman and Superman is my favorite superhero (like you hadn't noticed from my name and picture). The most recent BvS trailer showed too much especially that Doomsday reveal. A lot of people including me were already speculating that Doomsday would be in it, but it would have still been a nice surprise to see the reveal when we're watching the movie. Suicide Squad is still 7 months away and they'll surely come out with one more trailer so lets hope they don't reveal too much."
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice pictures!
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker and Harley needs more puns. Seriously.
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody brought me here 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,I WANT TO MARRY KATANA!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,it's gonna be awesome....luv the new joker with his teeth
CmRih_VtVAs,now we are talking
CmRih_VtVAs,"so we got jinx, brand, lucian and renekton? xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,August??... thought this movie was coming out next month?
CmRih_VtVAs,anybody know the name of the song?please
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't see the suicide
In this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is called Bohemian Rhapsody.Best song ever
CmRih_VtVAs,a movie that can make me forget green lantern's stupidity
CmRih_VtVAs,wrong guy for deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie strikes me as ""trying too hard""."
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that they used Bohemian Rhapsody gave me a boner o.o
CmRih_VtVAs,I have converted from the Marvel side to the DC side! I have seen the light!
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see this.
CmRih_VtVAs,That music is so terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey! If anyone is into GAMING, please take a look- no pressure to sub. If you want me to check our your content just leave a comment :-) have an awesome day guys!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Хуйня как обычно...
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker is so misplaced here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Uh oh... An August movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Uh oh... An August movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Poison Ivy anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,10/10 best movie of the year.
CmRih_VtVAs,What? Deadpool wanna be Squad? Looks semi legit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whoever thought Will Smith is Deadshoot, is on the same Meth as the joker, ugh, on the  other hand, I tax Harley till kingdom come"
CmRih_VtVAs,"i explained it in ""Piankenstein"" video on my channel"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this awesome looking movie!!! And BvS too of course
CmRih_VtVAs,i actually like this joker more.😊
CmRih_VtVAs,LAAAAAME
CmRih_VtVAs,"well, this trailer looks better than the previous one."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Those who ask what song is playing in the background, you don't deserve to watch this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,So pumped 😆
CmRih_VtVAs,fUCK IM SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think they don't show Spidey in the trailer, so many will surprised when he shows up."
CmRih_VtVAs,"anybody else pause. at 2:07
no? just me, you guys are missing out"
CmRih_VtVAs,ㅇ
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I went to the toilet in 2015 and came back in 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 will be a hella good year.
CmRih_VtVAs,ㅎ
CmRih_VtVAs,THE BEST TRAILER MANKIND HAS EVER SEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,horrible casting
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or Margot robbie is looking like anne hathaway in this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,i bet that scene were el diablo is screaming is his death scene
CmRih_VtVAs,too much plot ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let's admit it, at least the million views that this trailer got, was you... I love this trailer!! 😂😂😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I still have my doubts about the new Joker.. Regardless, still a good trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks good but I'd like it better if they used the Waller and deadshot from Arrow
CmRih_VtVAs,wait.. where's Batman??
CmRih_VtVAs,Howgy?  Extra Special Wrrk. elderly careless # 1!
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's going to be the best Marvel movie ever! While DC's Civil War sucks. There you go, star the conflict."
CmRih_VtVAs,has Joker glamour? #omg
CmRih_VtVAs,"We're bad guys, its wht we do! 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,More exited for this than i thought i would be
CmRih_VtVAs,background song name???
CmRih_VtVAs,"very worst trailer i ever seen is these ,  it's like a prank and i don't see anything that makes me happy , sorry but so bad these trailer ..."
CmRih_VtVAs,so the joker and harley quinn i guess
CmRih_VtVAs,"that's how it begins..

THE HYPE

it turns good men..

IMPATIENT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn is the best of the all trailer..
margot robbie is great"
CmRih_VtVAs,"COMMON IS IN THIS!! As the Tattooed Man.  I love that character, so underrated. He had a chance to shine in Final Crisis.  I wonder what they will do with him."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry Marvel, but your bullshit model of rehashing old Comic book events to sell tickets is over.  Civil War took place 10 years ago and was an epic marvel event, which tonnes of crossovers and it included the X-Men. Now they bastardize it to shove it into a film.  The Avengers infinity gauntlet story has already been played out of the Comics and AGE OF ULTRON has.  The Cap vs Bucky thing has, does Marvel Studios actually have an original idea that they can build on from scratch?  

DC is building everything from scratch with no bullshit references to the comics.  With the exception of the Frank Miller Batman vs Superman fight, they were going that fight anyways regardless of whether it was inspired by that.  All of their other movies will be original stories.  I feel sorry for Marvel fans, Marvel had it easy.  Now their live action comedies with Marvel characters in them will have to change."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a marvel fan, but I have to admit, this looks awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"30 millions of views in 4 days?
WOW! 
this movie gonna be Rock!"
CmRih_VtVAs,the joker is Freddie Mercury
CmRih_VtVAs,1:56 isnt it winter soldier ? (marvel)
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Hi Boys !"" , Harley <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a bad feeling that Batman vs Superman is going to suck but the suicide squad looks promising
CmRih_VtVAs,"Should be fun, I'm going"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,THE BEST MOVIE TRAILER ... EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,So many good superhero movies this year !
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith, well now I'm definitely watching it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,We are bad guys!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait... So that crazy chick with ""voices"" isn't Harley Quinn? If The Joker is in it where Harley at tho????"
CmRih_VtVAs,batman reborn...
CmRih_VtVAs,BS I cant W8 :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"people are saying this joker is closest to the original comics joker , how does that matter, if it isn't entertaining how does that actually matter?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this trailer so much! I'm so seeing the movie opening week😎
CmRih_VtVAs,Darude- Sandstorm.. Couldn't think of a better soundtrack for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best trailer, the song suits it. Im not sure whos the villain tho hahaha"
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing music choice here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:13 - 1:15 , was that *TITS*??  lol :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,"29,342,238 views ... 29 million was ME :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,they should release this movie in march and push BvS in August to make it better
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this going to be one heck of an epic movie
CmRih_VtVAs,most awaited movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"the one who picked this song is a genius.

kids nowadays need to learn what good music is."
CmRih_VtVAs,pg-13 trash which will not be capable of doing justice to the comic don't bother with this crap same your money for deadpool instead
CmRih_VtVAs,А давайте деградируем !?
CmRih_VtVAs,we have now seen all the best parts of the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,This and Deadpool are two movies I'm looking forward to this year~~~
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is this the real life?....





No this is Patrick."
CmRih_VtVAs,mehhh i like the cartoon dc movie better
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it ^^ <3
CmRih_VtVAs,suicide squad hype❤
CmRih_VtVAs,"After seeing this trailer, I'm more pumped for this than for batman v superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,so.... what exactly are they fighting?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone saying this is better than Batman V Superman. Lets get real this looks good but BvS is simply EPIC!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Last year, Mad Max: Fury Road is the most Insane Movie of 2015 ... I hope this year, Suicide Squad will be The Most Insane Movie of 2016!! Yeah!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,why do I feel slipknot will die off or receive no dialogue in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith doesn't deserve to be deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be a Crazy Amazing Movie!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:55 WOOOH!
CmRih_VtVAs,Knight Squad activator! license serial key generator!!! ==>  https://twitter.com/trusted_hacks/status/671785355989905409?pidid=4c0bcd59-6209-4baf-90ed-d37983c48e0c                                                                 Suicide Squad - Official Trailer 1 [HD]
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone expected Heath Ledger to be shit, let Margot Robbie and Leto have a chance >.>"
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith deadshot?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here!!
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn is friggin hot
CmRih_VtVAs,I will be buying this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer released ... and everybody went crazy :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh come on, harley must be always smiling not making pretty chick smile, but oh well good job!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"All you people talking shit about Harley not having her accent... She is great, come on. I didn't hear you crying back then when Heath Ledger did The Joker COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than the original Mark Hamill's. He had no accent whatsoever."
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide i wish.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it me or does Joker just keep on getting Creepier and Creepier






Worst.Hero's.Ever <3 I'm already in love"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen Brought me here! :P
CmRih_VtVAs,"So these guys were villains, then they turned to be someone who could save the world so who is the super villain here?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This 2 minute trailer was better than the entire Iron Man 3 lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,Well I'm sold on Leto being Joker and scared shitless of him
CmRih_VtVAs,hey guys which song was playing in d background
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've been watching this trailer every single day, seriously what the hell is wrong with you people?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"get a new thing! trying to hard overhyped nonsense
we all waited so long for dc to come onto the scene and what they do is just overhyped nonsense
should have sold this and batman superman to marvel instead of ruining your name"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's like DC's Guardians of the Galaxy (that's a compliment, fanboys)!!! Does anyone else here feel that this movie will be better than BvS?"
CmRih_VtVAs,jinx
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn sounds like white chick at the end of trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,que chingon esta super hello
CmRih_VtVAs,is batman in this movie ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"So now they're trying to make it look like it's similar to Deadpool. Weak sauce, DC. Weaker sauce, Warner Brothers. The movie is gonna' tank."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I Think Joker had to be Black..and actually a woman, feminist..and lesbian  , that would be politicaly correct movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so inlove with katana hayzz i feel funny ..
CmRih_VtVAs,WHERE IS THE BAT??
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait to see it i am so excited
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'll be honest, I'm a bit unsure about who I should root for"
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's hope Harley's lines are not as cheesy thru out the movie as they are in the trailer. That's not even Harley from her own comicbook character. Meh. Watch it when it's out on Netflix and borrow a buddies account.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer has gotten Guardians of the Galaxy 2 producers thinking they might have hit the reset button to somehow counter this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Tom Hardy?
CmRih_VtVAs,hat
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot looks great as Harley...but I'm so used to Tara Strong's voice...
CmRih_VtVAs,looks live it's gonna suck real bad
CmRih_VtVAs,hat
CmRih_VtVAs,I want harley to say Mr. J!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a boner so erect that I don't think my wife could even keep it up. 


Please don't tell her that."
CmRih_VtVAs,harley doesnt sound like harley -.- why?u cant jus grave a blond and call her harley quinn -.-
CmRih_VtVAs,10/10 would assemble again
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG so fucking AWESOME!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Such a well edited trailer! I am so pumped for this movie :D
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like it's gonna be fantastic.  And I think Margot Robbie is gonna totally nail it with Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,the alligator thing looks fucking stupid as fuck its completely fake
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody else got the feeling that they just saw the best parts of the movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Best movie trailer of 2016!! Also I've watched this trailer too many times
CmRih_VtVAs,leto is going to be a way better joker than ledger because ledger wasn't really a true joker to begin with.
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone more excited for this then superman vs batman
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm crazy and beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,"Here's what I get from this; to be cool/awesome you either have to drive yourself to pure insanity, develop or be born with some sort of deformitie/ ""power"", be a demon, or know how to use your eyes 



Seems easy enough"
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk remember the how good the first Dark Knight trailer. Yikes this is a close one! 😬
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is really well done WB, and excellent song choice.  so far, I'm still not sold on Harley, guess we will just have to see how she is in the movie, not enough content in the trailers to judge yet."
CmRih_VtVAs,In what superhero universe are they the baddest and most evil people on Earth?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer changed my mood from ""Well I'll wait for the reviews to come out."" to ""I'm seeing this opening weekend."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Movie looks stupid as fuck....
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this trailer is any indication, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is going to steal the movie. With all the 'heaviness' of the others, she is going to be the one to give a 'lightness' to the whole thing. I'll bet she'll be the one that comes first to a lot of minds when they look back on the movie. For instance: 'We're bad guys, it's what we do...' And her annoyed tone of voice an roll of her eyes, is just perfect for it. 

(She reminds me of the weird goth-type girl in my high school that we kept wondering why she seemed so sexy. Always skipping down the hall wearing long gypsy skirts and beach thongs and ropes of beads, sometimes painted all her nails in weird colors, etc. Like Luna in Harry Potter. Or tight leathers, strange makeup, etc. No doubt she had a great figure. And rarely dated, but when she did it was only the 'nerds'. Sure, the cheerleaders and the others were hot, but what was it about her? We just couldn't figure it out...)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't why but I'm much more excited for SS than BvS... I'm trying to keep my expectations low for BvS because then I won't be incredibly disappointed
CmRih_VtVAs,who are the 8k people that disliked this masterpiece?
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought that was Britta
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it bad that I was expecting Arleen Sorkin's Harley voice to come out of Margot Robbie's mouth? Got a little disappointed but I'll hafta watch the movie myself before I judge anything haha.
CmRih_VtVAs,A moment of silence for those people who said Jared Leto will suck as Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,The music works perfectly with the trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,No seriously why would you dislike this??
CmRih_VtVAs,Haha ive watched this more times than i should have and that joker laugh just made me laugh haha
CmRih_VtVAs,No me canso de mirarlo
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer i've ever seen in my life... for anything
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is soooo HOT!!!!!! <3 <3
CmRih_VtVAs,aT 0:17 the guy looks like furious peat
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone please tell me who or what it is that stops the subway train? and then there seems to be some long ass tentacles or something in one shot? any ideas??
CmRih_VtVAs,thay did good picking adele to do a new song for this trailer. she sounds great here!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm surprised they didn't play suicide is painless.
CmRih_VtVAs,what the hell is they fighting????? im lookin in my  comics and ehhhh not finding anything that looks like those beings.
CmRih_VtVAs,AVENGERS WHO?
CmRih_VtVAs,"the characters seems too try hard, the only fitting one is jared leto as the joker, cara just seems to be chucked in with her medicore acting skills"
CmRih_VtVAs,No one can honestly say that Smith's Deadshot and Leto's Joker are not epic looking
CmRih_VtVAs,That's not the joker... Or killer croc or even dead shot
CmRih_VtVAs,BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT  THERE NO KING SHARK OR DEATHSTROKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Agreed, using Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody was great choice on their part."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:29
The Joker's toys"
CmRih_VtVAs,I kinda don't want to watch it now...
CmRih_VtVAs,THE SONG OMFG
CmRih_VtVAs,not a fan of the new joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn just killed it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is Will Smith contractually obligated to say ""let's save the world."" In every movie he's in?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Big runner up for deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like this movie is DC's answer to Marvel's Guardian of The Galaxy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best trailer I've seen man.

I just wanna see it coz of the Joker & Harley Quinn."
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is about to be litty titty
CmRih_VtVAs,I think people are hating on Leto's Joker just because it's the cool thing to do. There are more things to worry about this movie and the Joker isn't one of them.
CmRih_VtVAs,is that not tom hardy????
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my god does Harley's shirt actually say daddy's lil gangster i need confirmation right now!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dont know about you guys, but I am mostly excited about harley quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's all be honest. This will be better than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""She is just crazy"" <3

This song, this trailer... I'm dying. Genial!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is great as Harley queen. I just loved every moment. The joker is great as well. And will smith is in this movie too.. so yes guys 2016 is going to be toooo frking god damn awesome...  \m/
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen forever!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is so perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,Squad goals.
CmRih_VtVAs,joker and Harley die
CmRih_VtVAs,1:00 - 1:03 XD i love Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not saying I mind, but man they made Harley Quinn look super slutty."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like pure shit. Fuck hollywood.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:36
That would be me in a battle😂😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC comics has the best movie trailer I ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel is dead.... (Waits for screaming fan boy outrage)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith as Deadshot? Really?  That's just horrible casting.  Don't get me wrong, he's good/okay in some movies, but even in this preview he is terrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG Harley tho!!❤🃏
CmRih_VtVAs,Oscar worthy
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is certainly a big year for WB, and we know they're going to crush it. NO, not in some pansy ass East/West Coast dick measuring contest like you bastards want, but a solid win in this genre for the slowest horse on the track. _You_ can have your favorites, but even you can see it's going to happen, and that's okay. It doesn't automatically your studio of choice will stop production, you little ninny."
CmRih_VtVAs,"REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD AND CREATIVE TRAILER,"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I still am not able to find myself in this! This means nothing, though, probably an end-credit reveal."
CmRih_VtVAs,Al parecer sera buena
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really want to see the new Joker he's my favorite ""bad guy"". But he's going to be hard to outplay the Joker from the dark knight"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so excited for this. I've been waiting for them to finally include Harely in the movies! she's been in the comics,cartoons,etc. It's about god damn time,Marvel. And Jared Leto! I'm PSYCHED."
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM SOOOO EXCITED!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,PLEASE movie be great please be great am so exited and ready abt you please dont suck
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think it's a very real possibility that this will outshine Batman vs. Superman. In my opinion, BvS just seems to take itself too seriously, but Suicide Squad looks like it actually has some humor and fun to it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""what was that I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry... the voices, haha I'm kidding that's not what the really said...""  LMAO!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Came here from Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,"8,613 people have never heard of queen"
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO SHIT ON BATMAN V SUPERMAN... batman v superman is going to be pretty awesome still but..... THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE MAD!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks shit tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,_HARLEY QUINN IS SUCH A FUCKING PERFECT CHARACTER 😍😍 AHH I LOVE HER SO MUCH I CANT WAIT TO WATCH HER ON MY BIRTH MONTH 😍😍_
CmRih_VtVAs,DC= throw out everything and start over.
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok , hey, hi there, warm greetings from Malaysia, check it out my Pop song cover, there are music of different genre, please enjoy!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Harley Quinn played by the girl from wolf of Wall Street?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who even is the villain
CmRih_VtVAs,"i mean open mind for a new joker yhadda yhadda, but you can't tell me his laugh doesn't be sounding like waluigi..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope the post credit scene will tease infinity wars!! I love Captain America also
CmRih_VtVAs,"More heroes, anti-heroes and badarse villains for 2016? This is going to be a fucking funtastic year!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"top 10 characters that i am most interest to see in this movie 

1- Joker
2- enchantress 
3- harley quinn 
4- El diablo 
5- killer croc 
6- katana 
7- captain boomerang 
8- rick Flag 
9- deadshot 
10- slipknot 

so tell me, what's yours?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Malditamente asombroso, agosto ven a mí 😆"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm marvel fanboy, but I like this trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol this is my favorite movie and it isn't even out yet.
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Freddy Mercury
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this song
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok this movie looks really good but I think BVS is going to be better. I mean its freaking batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Couldn´t have chosen a better song
CmRih_VtVAs,This suicide squad is waaaaaaaaaaay better then the tiny Arrow suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love both this trailer and the comic con trailer but I think they portray two very different movies. The comic con trailer sets a much darker mood and Harley Quinn seems like a very different character. She looks crazy in both but a different kind of crazy like funny cute crazy and mentally disturbed crazy. The songs in both trailers are awesome and fit perfectly and they may seem very different while I started a joke seems dark and bohemian rhapsody light and fun, if you listen to the lyrics, they both talk about the world misunderstanding and judging them. Bohemian rhapsody is about Freddy being gay and not being able to tell anyone and I  started a joke about being misunderstood and suffering while others find pleasure. I think the songs fit perfectly since the movie is about a bunch of criminals who everyone thinks is crazy and evil but forgets that they are human beings too and they can ""do some good"" as Viola Davis says. Either way I think the movie will be great!"
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is playing in the back ground
CmRih_VtVAs,Looked good until Will Smith showed up. His Schtick is getting old.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie not acting the harley quinn part well for me. Not crazy enough. to formal and to booring
CmRih_VtVAs,Fantastic 4
CmRih_VtVAs,the best trailer.ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Almost like movie trailer version of Deadpool's poster campaigns, good take on making something different 👍🏼"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omsakthi
CmRih_VtVAs,i wasn't expecting much of captain boomerang but he seems awesome in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"yay...will Smith in another movie, playing (surprise!) will smith.......yaaaaawn."
CmRih_VtVAs,love the new joker
CmRih_VtVAs,This week my source of love has been both this trailer and the song <3 :')
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn isn't just ""crazy"", she's fucking smart. she went through medical school and became a psychologist for arkham. she also has a very high IQ point. so, on top of being a little bit fucking crazy after being with the joker all these years, SHES A FUCKIN GENIUS"
CmRih_VtVAs,and is this why i prefer russian films
CmRih_VtVAs,Best part of the trailer.... Margot Robbies ass ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 That scene is going to be inteeense...i can't wait T.T
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh yes. I had no Ideas they would have so much fun. And their good guys....Yah right and I'm the Incredible Hulk......Hulk Smash
CmRih_VtVAs,What is it rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bet this is gonna be better than Batman Vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,nah i think this will be bigger than bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok... so is the SS going against the the Joker? Or am I missing something...
CmRih_VtVAs,I honestly had doughts for this movie but now I'm convinced that this will be a good movie
CmRih_VtVAs,so usually amanada waller puts bombs in the squads necks to make them co operate. for some reason i feel like they wont do that in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks gay af.
CmRih_VtVAs,I need that soundtrack in my life
CmRih_VtVAs,best movie of the year
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody 🙌
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like marylin manson in far away clips.
CmRih_VtVAs,8th time watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Please don't ruin Dr Harleen Francis Quinzel.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn but I want her signature accent!!
CmRih_VtVAs,TIHS IS JYOKA??
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah... Still not for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else is so pumped to see this movie.....I cant even stop watching the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,the only probleem i have is harly quin and the joker. i like the other depictions of them compared to these new ones
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate how theyre portraying harley. she just comes off as annoying. joker looks dumb too... wish theyd go back to how they were in the 90s cartoon series. best representation of them on screen ever
CmRih_VtVAs,wow what a comment. typical queen fan.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Was there any intention using the most overplayed song of all time? Movie looks good but Jared Leto is gonna be a weak joker I think, plus from what I read on celeb gossip forums when searching for douchebag stories on actors/musicians Jared is a sick-minded manipulative cheating peadophile. It'll be a matter of time when the allegations and charges come his way and he's the next Bill Cosby for sure."

CmRih_VtVAs,Slipknot is so screwed
CmRih_VtVAs,"is it the trailer, or the music that gets me?"
CmRih_VtVAs,overrated and looks boring
CmRih_VtVAs,holy fuck if this came out without me knowing this existed in the MoS universe i would of thought this was and entirely different DC world i love how different this feels compared to MoS even if they have the same batman
CmRih_VtVAs,the only thing i am disappointed with is harley quinn tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,You can really tell how much they wanted Tom Hardy instead of Jai Courtney from the styling. They look so much alike here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love harley's quote ""We're bad guys, that's what we do!"" I LOVE THAT"
CmRih_VtVAs,Expectations are set to very low.
CmRih_VtVAs,They should have used the dead shot from arrow he is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith boyz!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm glad Margot was already nude in Wolf of Wall Street, just to get that out of the way, because jeez she's smoking hot"
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer reminds me of guardians of the galaxy for some reason
CmRih_VtVAs,"OH SHIT THIS MOVIE LOOKS AWESOME wait August?

Can I fucking kill myself yet?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,song plz
CmRih_VtVAs,"when i watch deadpool ima be like ""that dude was crazy af"" when i watch this movie ""HOLY FUCK THESE BITCHES ARE PHYCO PATHS"" *nerdgasms*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know many of you here are already going to see this movie. But, for those who are unsure, what incentives would make you or others you know on the fence go and see this movie? Would a promise of a small gift for opening/presales like a quality key-chain be incentive enough or do you need to see more trailers before a decision can be made."
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,SWEET!
CmRih_VtVAs,rre anormales son los personajes esos jaja xD
CmRih_VtVAs,This gives BVS a run for its money!
CmRih_VtVAs,wow the music sucks!!!!! queen sucks!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I remember when people used to say that this joker was going to be one of the worst and now look at them now they like leto
CmRih_VtVAs,Lame.
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant stop watching this trailer. this anf deadpool most anticipated movies to watch.  i will laugh so hard on these movies 😆
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys!!! Oh man I feel bad for that guy May God help you 😭😭😭😭😭
CmRih_VtVAs,.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that one girl going to play in every last movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this is done right and word gets around I bet it can beat the first Avengers movie......well maybe not, but close?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else only came for Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,"<3 Harley, you da queen! <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is awesome like star wars 3rd trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope IronMan is in this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Call me crazy but ive been trying to figure why i love this trailer so much, it feels a lot like guardians of the galaxy to me. Now hear me out, its a bunch of criminals trying to good but they dont have much care of their surroundings too much or following the law. They look out for themselves and it seems like a serious movie with some comedy involved (but that seems to be the formula for superhero movies). Their are a few other things and i doubt the movie is going to be anything like it but the trailer gives me a good vibe about the movie. Cant wait.


Edit: Aside from the comparison i love the way this trailer is making the movies seem to be. Crazy action packed with a dark story but a nonchalant way of tackling it."
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this (at the beginning
CmRih_VtVAs,I love your videos
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie will be the perfect Harley Quinn :)
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is in 1:40-2:05
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is in 1:40-2:05
CmRih_VtVAs,Man i barely got bohemian rhapsody out of my head. now i cant get it out of my head again. oh well.... great fucking trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok so I saw the trailer in the ad before the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,shit
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait to show u my toys...
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it bad I watch this like all the time?? XD I just can't wait for it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Aug. is too damn far away,we want this now damnit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a neon dipped piece of shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,August is way too far away
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07... Damn...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait for this movie, I really like the Marvel heroes but man DC always had the best villains."
CmRih_VtVAs,sub to me and i ll sub back
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please be rated RRRRRR!!!, everybody here needs to watch Deadpool at least 5 times, show them it can make money(which it already can) with the rating."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seems like a bad choice for the DCU's third movie. Most characters look stupid or uninteresting. Still, could be decent. They should've replaced this with Wonder Woman or a new Batman movie so that BvS isn't a rushed pile of garbage."
CmRih_VtVAs,AAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,I litterally can't stop watching it omgg 💘
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love Warner Brothers. When i'm smoking some weed and you see some cops, ""Warn a Brotha"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome trailer!! but I still think the guy who play joker in Gotham suits better than Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,looks  boring
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked the trailer but I feel like they could have used a better song choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,is Harley Quinn reading twilight?????? lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't fucking wait.So hyped, take that shitty bvs movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody! perfect song!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie (judging from this trailer alone) seems to embrace the madness behind it all, and flow with a very chaotic feel, while the trailers for Batman Vs Superman, and Civil War, both seem to try too hard to create a dark feeling. Personally I believe this trailer (and the upcoming film) are better, and will be better then the other two superhero-genre type movies coming out later this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,marvel sucks balls
CmRih_VtVAs,james ried.and nadune lustre will surely.watch this. #jadine
CmRih_VtVAs,"anyone else feel like doing some crazy, explosive sh*t when they see this?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Do you think Will will be nominated for Oscar for his role in this movie??  I sure hope so, because the awards show just isn't going to any good unless Will and Jada are attending."
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE IS SICK I LOVE IT!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I already hate her as Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did you guys notice that in some of the shots where Harley is in prison she has the blue and pink hair and others she's full blond. I have a theory, that they fail a mission or something goes wrong that gets them back into prison and then are called out a second time in a finale. I'm trying to see something that backs this up."
CmRih_VtVAs,"best trailer ever, ... ever !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Typical Jew Bullshit... Deadshot is WHITE!  

You want a BLACK character, THEN created one from scrap who is BLACK.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Soy única y diferente
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is there a way to love a trailer? There is, and this is the one!"
CmRih_VtVAs,is it even posible that this dude could look any cooler than he does @ 1:47?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm gonna be completely honest with all of you, fans and actors alike. First trailer was very mixed for me, verging on the ""not pleased,  going to need MORE convincing."" Looking at this trailer, that ""convincing"" was won over in mere seconds. I'm not much of a DC fan like many of you out there. In fact, all I can really stand is Batman and the Teen Titans. I'm a fan of them for sure!!!
The DC cinematic is something I'm going to really have to try and get into the best I can, with one thing being that. I know of some of the protag-antagonists, Harley, Deadshot, Croc, I know. The others? More research is needed and required. Anyways, I think that the movie is off to a  great start with this trailer and am looking forward to seeing it more than I was than when I saw the Comic Con trailer. I'm even more excited to see it than the Batman vs Superman movie.....damn the Lex Luthor casting. It's like the only thing holding me back. Otherwise, I'm getting more excited for that."
CmRih_VtVAs,okay I'm not a die hard DC fan so why is Harley Quinn's hair pink and blue rather than the iconic black and red?
CmRih_VtVAs,personally i don't like this joker's laugh but i'll give Leto a chance
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn ftw!
CmRih_VtVAs,esse filme tem que ter no minimo três horas pra mostrar pelo menos um pouco da historia de cada um e o vilão(kkkkk) do filme
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a marvel fan but this seems like one of the best superhero movies ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Worst. Heroes. Ever""

Well, they are still better than ""Teen Titans Go""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Okokok looks hella awesome but I'm not sure I actually like what I've seen of harley quinn so far.  Idk I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong...but I just don't know if they've got the character right (I'll wait and see)
CmRih_VtVAs,Eso esta para  ver una y otra ves nos e cuanto pueda esta ya con cada trailer  q sale  ase q  salga mas fenomenal
CmRih_VtVAs,song name
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks amazing as Mr. J!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,#nerdgasm who's with me?
CmRih_VtVAs,i wanna facefucc dat blondie
CmRih_VtVAs,I am the only one who spotted the Monster energy drink commercial at 2:03 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,the movies keep getting better and better.. xD
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST REALLY
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:28 My favorite moment. I just love that laugh. I can't wait to see Jared Leto's performance, I love this!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who watched this 100 times
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA DELEVINGNE 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody.....................ENOUGH SAID!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm surprised no one has caught Will Smith's infamous line: ""Let's go save the world."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably the best marvel of the year. I am waiting it like a kid :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one that loves this depiction of Harley? 
Also, I have to say, this is definitely one of those movies where I just will watch it not for deep, philosophical reasons, or for any specific story reason. I'll just watch it to have a good fuckin' time with my friends at the theater. Sometimes, just to know you're human, you just gotta take a breather, and this definitely looks like the best one to take."
CmRih_VtVAs,joder que ganas tengo de verla madre mia
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel a little bad now ... of all the superhero movies that are coming out this year, this is the ONLY  ""must see"" on my list"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can somebody tell me what is the name of the book Harley Quinns book?
CmRih_VtVAs,How in Azura's name are there people who dislike this.
CmRih_VtVAs,did u guys see kickin wing?
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like we are gonna see a lot of Joker? Or at least more than I expected. Not sure how I feel about that. Trailer looked good. Can't wait to see this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so ducking fine
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fan here, this movie looks like it will be awesome, I just hope they didnt make this one a cluster fuck like Batman v Superman will be."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so fucking ridiculous.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wtf, The Thompson Holiday trailer came on at the same time I started watching this playing the exact same song!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, guess the masses are tired of the same boring Batman, Superman, et al."
CmRih_VtVAs,That's a really flat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,deadshot is white and dead cuz he died in the arrow series so already holes in the story line plus looks dumb
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is back BEATCHES!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"how the fuck does so many people not know this song in the trailer, Come on man I listen to hip hop and I know who Queen are."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hello, 99% of you guys wont read this but i just want to let you guys to know that im a new youtuber! My dream is to be a big youtuber! Many in my school knows about my channel, and they make fun of me and say that im never going to be big. But i dont care, im gonna try to make my dream come true. And i need your guys help ❤️ i post mostly gaming videoes and i really want to build a fanbase, this is my dream, and i need you guys to help me! I post daily gaming videoes and try to make better quality videos everytime. If you subbed or watched some of my videos, thanks, and you're the best!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Only watching it for Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,the best song for the trailer!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"If anybody even dare ask what song this is, I'll fucking kick them in the nuts."
CmRih_VtVAs,Tuve que parar de ver el trailer cuando me di cuenta que estaba viendo la pelicula entera enserio... paren de hacer eso Xd.
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone's losing there shit over joker. I'm just worried why jai ain't using boomerangs
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the actor at 1:27?
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks really good and we got more Joker and Harley scenes!
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope one day I find a man who turn me on as hard as this trailer.....
CmRih_VtVAs,SONG PLS
CmRih_VtVAs,"rumours say that the Joker may be jason todd because it was said that when The Joker tortured Jason, he carved a J on his left cheek. It would also explain why The Joker looks so yound and new in the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Stupid movie without any story !
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07.. most paused moment in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone know the age rating?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dat ass, though."
CmRih_VtVAs,this  would be awesome if i was twelve years old
CmRih_VtVAs,i had hoped deathstroke would feature in this
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like the concept and the cast, but not so much the script, it looks kind of dumb."
CmRih_VtVAs,very well edited
CmRih_VtVAs,this can be so f. f. fun

CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever put this frickin amazing trailer together PLEASE give some tips to the Batman vs. Superman people. The trailers are supposed to make you WANT to go see the movie. B vs. S should have stopped after the teaser and the trailer after that.
CmRih_VtVAs,"From Jack Nicholson to Heath Ledger. Just when you thought  The Joker couldn't get any better, You watch this trailer and are sadden to find out. You are correct,
He Can't."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks that when the joker jumps in the toxic waste he's saving Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,däääämn
CmRih_VtVAs,So where's deathstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is perfect.
The pacing of this trailer is magnifique. This trailer is a WORK OF FUCKING ART."
CmRih_VtVAs,NEED. TO. WATCH!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly looks lame. The way they try integrating Bohemian Rhapsody, of all songs they could have chosen, into an action movie trailer just looks fucking stupid. And you can tell Harley is going to just fucking ruin it. Her character is just the ""lol, im soooooo quirky and cute, look at me, I joke about being crazzzzy"" and the delivery is just honest to god cringy."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 Any 1 else see the heart?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the guy in the panda suit?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like more this Joker than Heath Ledger's joker, yep I said it"
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst song choice Everest
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad is going to be better than BvS. Or the trailer was just THAT good...
CmRih_VtVAs,R.I.P Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,All these  movies coming out this year is making my life so much better.
CmRih_VtVAs,So to aqui por culpa do DJ :P
CmRih_VtVAs,Unconvinced
CmRih_VtVAs,"that is the worst harley queen ive ever seen. They grabed ab excelent story and made it funny, that is a deadpool thing, not joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,"1.Civil War

CmRih_VtVAs,This year will be great for movies

CmRih_VtVAs,unico que habla en español
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tom Hardy acting in this movie? of course Will Smith, Robie Margot and Cara Delevine too but one of then is Tom Hardy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dc shit
CmRih_VtVAs,I love that they used Bohemian Rapshody
CmRih_VtVAs,Song really suits trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is very colorful and the song and beat r in target.


oh and u haven't seen everything this is just a tip of the iceberg."
CmRih_VtVAs,yo best trailer to this movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS THE BEST FUCKING TRAILER IVE EVER SEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,This could be the movie i been waiting for!
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm so exited for this movie! it seems like it will have a different feel than any other DC movies which i'm sure will help make it successul!
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh how I fear this is going to be a Good trailer Bad movie scenario again...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm wondering how this movie can make sense with no Batman. These are all Batman villains, people he's put away for doing all sorts of nasty things...so what, Bats doesn't know about the Suicide Squad? He does know but isn't taking any action against them, either as Batman or as Bruce Wayne?"
CmRih_VtVAs,i don't know how i'll be able to wait until fucking august for this damn
CmRih_VtVAs,Seriously..Every time I watch this trailer I feel like it's better and better. Sry my english is not good :)
CmRih_VtVAs,What makes them a suicide squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks amazing. and I like how they portray Harley Quinn. and I just realized something. aside from Joker, nobody here has been in a movie before. that just makes me more exited. and everyone is acting like their comic book counterpart. I'm more of a marvel fan, but this looks like it could be one of the best superhero (not really heroes, though) movies ever."
CmRih_VtVAs,gay
CmRih_VtVAs,Un premio oscar al mejor trailer

CmRih_VtVAs,Как такое дерьмо может нравится ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why the fuck is Will Smith playing deadshot?
CmRih_VtVAs,im really glad Will smith is part of this film 👌👌👌
CmRih_VtVAs,i think ive given this video at least 100views
CmRih_VtVAs,"Esta película es PG-13 o R?

CmRih_VtVAs,I CANNOT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see Deadshot in this movie. NOT WILL SMITH!!!  Where's his FLIPPING mask the whole time?? GAWD
CmRih_VtVAs,The scène with captain boomerang getting out of the sack and hit the agent got me really laughing real hard
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks awesome and Harley Quinn looks banging xP
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie.... Why do you have to be so damnnn hot.....
CmRih_VtVAs,The blond one is like Jinx from LOL.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith probably wants an Oscar for phoning this in.
CmRih_VtVAs,Just completed seeing it the 100th time....thank you WB and DC Comics !
CmRih_VtVAs,which song is used at last??????????
CmRih_VtVAs,Movie about Jinx confirmed? :P

CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect song for the perfect trailer:D
CmRih_VtVAs,"no puedo dejar de pensar que con HEATH LEDGER esta pelicula hubiera sido mejor, de todas formas se que Jared lo hara bien :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Waayyy too disneyish for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman vs superman got this amount of views in two months...suicide squad got the same amount in five days!

Slay skawd slay!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"on 1:21 look at that guys back, whats that golden thing?? maybe a sword"

CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the Joker look like a cross between David Bowie and Lil Jon...
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck that queen song was annoying!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tried watching this with an open mind and disregarding all previous teases, but I still am not feeling this Joker. I'm liking the voice Leto's doing, but really don't care for the look."
CmRih_VtVAs,can anybody tell me what's the BGM's name in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow... Awesome..

CmRih_VtVAs,wow super
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer i have seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Since Marvel fanboys know that this trailer is bomb and can't shut up they write comments like: ""I""m actually more excited to this then BvS...""
You better just leave... just, leave."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow this really looks like fun! Imma gonna see it! In theaters! 
I have to say, between this and Deadpool I get the feeling that 2016 might be the year that changes the superhero film genre a bit. Both of these films deconstruct the superhero film genre a bit in featuring characters who aren't quite as heroic and selfless as your average superheroes. If both of these films are successful and can catch the audiences' attention we might see more of these kinds of films in the future. And I for one am ready for that because even though I'm a comic book fan I've kind of started to grow tired of superhero films already. It would be nice to see something different on the big screen and movies about villains and antiheroes might be exactly what I need. I mean you can watch Avengers save the world while making quips and being perfect nice guys only so many times before it gets stale."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why harleyquinn loks like a porn actris?

CmRih_VtVAs,"I know some people do not like the idea of another Joker then the one that Heath Ledger portrayed. And some say Jared Leto is not appropriate for the role. 

But seriously that facial expression in the scene at 1:19 is really, really well done by Jared Leto. You can see the hate and anger behind the smile of the Joker. 

Can't wait to see the full movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this trailer

CmRih_VtVAs,Good trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,im so excited i cant even wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"I could imagine Lady Gaga portraying the role of Harley Quinn if Margot Robbie didn't ""accept"" the role.  Just sayin' ! This movie is just cool and crazy.  From PHilippines with love."
CmRih_VtVAs,Good idea not showing Batman. David Ayer and Warner Bros. know that fans can assume Batman is in the movie if the Joker has the slightest part in the film. Trailer No. 2 will probably show B-man.
CmRih_VtVAs,Really not a fan of the jokers aesthetic but I'm still buying the shit out of this movies funko pops.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody made this good trailer even better
CmRih_VtVAs,More excited to see this one than Batman Vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,My only gripe is that Margot Robbie doesn't do the voice of Harley Quinn aka Arleen Sorkin.  That's it!
CmRih_VtVAs,I will be ashamed if they don't at the very least include Styx's Renegade in the soundtrack.
CmRih_VtVAs,@ 1:43 I sure do hope that's Poison Ivy! that would be so fukin badass!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto gives such fan service to all the Jokers!  I see everyone: Romero, Nicholson, Hamill, and even Ledger in there!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope jai courtneys not in it
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so fucking perfect!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thank god Will Smith is in this movie or else Jada Smith would of called for ""racism."" Lmao"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06  yeah!
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's the batman!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Look at who is in the seat when joker says ""I can't wait to show you my toys""...Looks like Ben affleck possibly?"
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i remember joker saying""I cant wait to show you my NEW toys"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"The style is reminding me a bit of ""Saints Row the Third"", anyone else?"
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn is the only reason I'm going to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn this trailer is so sick!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm soooooooo excited for this xx
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason I will probably watch the movie is to hear Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,jinx .............<3
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish people would realize that even if Heath Ledger was alive, he wouldn't play the Joker in this universe. They've relaunched them all. Like how Bale is no longer Batman. Respect the past, embrace the future. Harley Quinn's casting was beyond perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,im glad they didnt went the typical ''bwaaaaaam'' trailer. movie looks fun
CmRih_VtVAs,2:02
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard General Zod makes an appearance.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:56 that b Joker in da bakround?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harleys dialogues are cringeworthy. Everything else looks amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley doesn't have a Brooklyn accent :(
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Joker didn't have that stupid grill I'd be fine with all the stupid tattoos, but the grill just ruins the look for me"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if a DC vs Marvel movie is possible...how would they be able to construct a story where they both meet.
CmRih_VtVAs,To be honest Joker looks like ugly teenager
CmRih_VtVAs,Really wanted to see Poison Ivy in this movie ^^; looks amazing anyways though!
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like they shouldn't post any more trailers cause then it would give it all away (Spoilers). But thats me
CmRih_VtVAs,"God, I wanna see this so badly"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Three Things I Know/Think:

1. Slipknot and Boomerang are, at least, thinking of betraying the squad 1:11
2. Joker will only appear in flashbacks (more obvious)
3. The goo is magic (you can't just science that up)

What I Don't Know:

1. How the heck does Harley Quinn get tea?"
CmRih_VtVAs,harley is hot
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is going to be the best year for movies..
CmRih_VtVAs,but August is still far ;-;
CmRih_VtVAs,"So. You know how in this movie, Harley Quinn has Pink and Blue pigtails? When Joker rises Harley from the acid, you see the colors pink and blue. That scene is a flashback to when Harley wasn't ""crazy."" Most likely, she dyed her pigtails those colors as a thank you."
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol Suicide Squad is constantly having more trailer views than Batman v. Superman. 

This time its not even close 26 mill vs 21"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes I love this movie can't wait to watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why, but I just can't get behind Will Smith as Deadshot for some reason."
CmRih_VtVAs,"ANYONE ELSE NOTICE HARLEY'S ""PUDDIN"" NECK BRACE IS ONLY IN CERTAIN SHOTS? I don't mean like when she's in prison, but when she's all done up?"
CmRih_VtVAs,/
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm the director of this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Parece buena pero, en serio que mal esta él Wason que le paso? :'("
CmRih_VtVAs,At 0:37 he looks like Dean Ambrose
CmRih_VtVAs,So you think you can stop them and spit in their eyes?
CmRih_VtVAs,*watches this 10 times in a row*
CmRih_VtVAs,That ass tho
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome want to see it so bad
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is awesome. Even those few people who hate DC movies, have to admit, this trailer was pretty Bad-Ass."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a question, has Capt. Boomerang always been like this crazy in comics? I have never seen a Flash comic with Boomerang in it that's why I'm asking"
CmRih_VtVAs,oh Argus and your suicide squads. P.s Will smith is deadshot or I think he is.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this where i get mine craft mods?
CmRih_VtVAs,Been a long time since I've been excited for Will Smith in a big budget movie. So glad he looks great in this!
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how I'm starting to see rumours of a Sinister Six movie being revived and rumours of a Thunderbolts movie being considered after WB and DC released this new trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so excited people!!! My favorites!!! I mean Joker I can kind of deal with since if Joker was a real guy he would sooo have tattoos. Anyways, I can't wait!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,God was Harely Quinn cringe in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only who really really really despises Will Smith playing as Will Smith ?? am I the only one who sees it ?
CmRih_VtVAs,THE SODA PART WAS FUNNY!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is out of place in this movie and Harley Quinn sounds too dumb for the character
CmRih_VtVAs,will Smith !!!! life goals complete!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,#Dctakeover
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else paused when she bent over? Kappa
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see Leto version of the Joker! I think he's gonna blow people away like When Heath Ledger did his joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,YouTube brought me here anyone else get here same way?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else is here because of Queen?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fan here with a message for you DC fans:

Good luck! And I mean that! I hope your cinematic universe turns out great! 

Not trying to sound all pompous or whatever, but you guys are kinda behind us. That doesn't mean you can't catch up, though! 

After seeing this, I'm sure you guys will do awesome! 

Though, to be honest, I'm slightly more excited for this than Batman vs Superman.... 

BvS seemed to blow it's load in the last trailer. This one looks like it's still got lots of tricks up its sleeve.

Anyways, I think I'm speaking for a number of Marvel fans when I say I want you guys to have as much fun and get as much enjoyment out of your universe as we do ours!

Here's to you, DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,thanks for the traumatic heath ledger flashbacks
CmRih_VtVAs,predictable
CmRih_VtVAs,I've seen this trailer 30+ times now because of that fucking ad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Song!!!!!!!!!!! Please
CmRih_VtVAs,queen ❤
CmRih_VtVAs,Im more excited for this than Bat vs Super...
CmRih_VtVAs,What's that stuff on joker when he is the acid
CmRih_VtVAs,HELP ! HELP PLEASE! I broke the freakin replay button. can't stop watching
CmRih_VtVAs,Also the guy there fighting looks like a mimic
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen omg
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason I've seen this trailer so many times is Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,fun
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury made this trailer extremely great.
CmRih_VtVAs,and starring Adam Beach....
CmRih_VtVAs,só eu de br?
CmRih_VtVAs,The crazy one is soo beautiful. haha :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fucking sick!
CmRih_VtVAs,Stop the trailer at 1:56 you can see the Joker behind Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait to see Jared Leto play the Madness Prince, Joker!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just want all the merchandise....
CmRih_VtVAs,daaaaaayyuuuummm.... this is more hype than batman v superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Previous opinion: God, I hate the new joker. New opinion: Holy shit, I can't wait to see the new joker on the big screen."
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 Dat ass 
wanna see more ? Watch  the wolf of wall street"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie will flop , I'm calling it and Civil War is waaaaaay better than this crap."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC all the way. yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok why isnt slade wilson (aka. Deathstroke) in the team he should be hes my favourite :(

CmRih_VtVAs,"very inside my mind I was waiting for a trailer with R.B. soundtrack,  I was tired of same cliches in trailers.

congratulations"
CmRih_VtVAs,SO EXCITED!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,the design text in this movie looks like a kid that plays cod with 20 subs intro
CmRih_VtVAs,-:
CmRih_VtVAs,I now think every movie trailer needs to have Bohemian Rhapsody as the song.  I can't think of a movie this wouldn't work with.
CmRih_VtVAs,"yeah, that gotta be harley origin, in set footage joker was wearing same clothes"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope so badly that it's pg13 so I can watch it... 😗
CmRih_VtVAs,I couldn't even recognize Jay Hernandez/diablo
CmRih_VtVAs,jokers laugh sounds like peter griffin combined with wario
CmRih_VtVAs,This is ... AWESOME !
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish they would have just made a Joker movie about him and HQ and have batman be in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,All you DC fans out there have you heard of the villain OMAC? I believe that's who the main villain is and who there fighting in this movie if your not familiar with his character look him up his under used but still bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Seems DC knows how to suddenly make a good movie again.
CmRih_VtVAs,What makes this trailer so awsome is Queen!!
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck all these haters in the comment section.

CmRih_VtVAs,This is the 100th time I watched this trailer.......I might have a problem?
CmRih_VtVAs,yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is mine joker get your hands off of her!
CmRih_VtVAs,who is that samurai wielding girl?
CmRih_VtVAs,Without the music of Queen it would a huge pile of garbage.

CmRih_VtVAs,harlley is very sex

CmRih_VtVAs,check out my talking cat video if you're bored
CmRih_VtVAs,"And where are the heroes? Oh, they're fighting each other..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm only watching this cause my friend told me it has bohemian rhapsody on it. the rest, not bringing anything new on the scene, I feel like after Deadpool its gonna be all about Anti heroes, and seriously? nobody seemed to like Kickass when it came out... now suddenly everyone is into it."
CmRih_VtVAs,r jokers toys long and purple
CmRih_VtVAs,"warner... i want a deathstroke movie

CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever
CmRih_VtVAs,This or the last Star Wars. Which is more anticipated
CmRih_VtVAs,So so so so hyped for this!

CmRih_VtVAs,I can't believe I have to wait until August to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the guards name in the beginning?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,I doubt anyone else noticed this but at 2:05-2:06 when Harley breaks the glass look at her legs they look really weird. They look they're prosthetic legs. Idk what that's about but it's seems odd. You have to pause right when she breaks the glass.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith if you want an Oscar get more serious and better roles.
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn I just wanna watch this because of Margot... She's literally perfect!!!! 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bombed already...

CmRih_VtVAs,"At first, I thought they were gonna fuck up Harley Quinns character and sexualize her and remove her badassness. But that doesn't seem like it's gonna happen."
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,I just see it repeatedly for the using bohemian rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,God you can't even mention Marvel in the comments without being completely destroyed by someone
CmRih_VtVAs,That last line was cringe worthy. Its so bad but still gonna watch the shit out of this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Arrasaram muito com a música do Queen!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you make a movie trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 Joker has Tyler's kiss sign on his hand (Fight Club reference)
CmRih_VtVAs,someone know the song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,HEY WARNER BROS. YOU SHOULD MAKE A FALLOUT TV SERIES IT HAS PLETHERA OF GAMES AND A GREAT STORY BUT PLEASE AT LEAST PLAY SOME OF THE CONSOLE GAMES TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY AND MCHANICS BECAUSE IF YOU DO IT RIGHT IT WOULD BE AN AWSOME SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am i the only one here that thinks the trailer was bait designed to get ""edgy"" teens to go watch the movie

CmRih_VtVAs,Please take your time to browse my channel and maybe view and like some videos
CmRih_VtVAs,I realy hope this movie won't be some shitty PG-13 movie like Man of Steel
CmRih_VtVAs,this is amazing !
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel: Um... WE have civil war...?.... Yeah go check that out for us
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,I think they made the joker the worst they could
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not a comic book aficionado.... but I gather this is the Suicide Squad vs. The Joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,omg I want to watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh boy, here comes another Jada boycott!"
CmRih_VtVAs,K beia historia de amor
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow. Moral decay all around. Let's not make good super hero movies anymore, lets just have a bunch of the lowest morale people we can get and glorify them."

CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or is anybody else more exited for Suicide Squad then BvS?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Joker is different to the Last, but was more the origin of himself, so i really wanna see this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG! this keeps looking better and better. think Dc may have a chance at beating the marvel universe after all
CmRih_VtVAs,the hype is real
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this from?
CmRih_VtVAs,that bohemian rhapsody( correct? )
CmRih_VtVAs,donde putas esta batman 😢
CmRih_VtVAs,song?????
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Is soon damn hot and the best choice for my beloved Harley Quinn. Baby I love you
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst. Heroes. Ever. but who said they were heroes?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sorry to sound sour but I hate the idea of this movie not the concept but the idea to make this comic into a movie since all of dcs comics are more like real life so who would sign off on this stupid idea to let criminals go free granted with gourds but still
CmRih_VtVAs,is a Joker a member of the squad or is he the villain they're going after?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone remind me why they let these bad guys out?
CmRih_VtVAs,I live that this movie has a little humour. I'm so excited for this movie and the deadpool movie!!

CmRih_VtVAs,"Hopefully they all actually die.
Not pull a shitty victory from retconville."
CmRih_VtVAs,норм жопа
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley looks and sounds amazing! Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fanboys do not have balls to admit this trailers awesomeness. So they found a way to criticize BvS by claiming SS trailer to be better, then they are bitching for it being a copy of shitty GOTG, while they don't know the Suicide squad was in works from 2010 and script was ready, they were just waiting for The dark knight trilogy to finish as Nolan didn't wanted two live-action Batman universes on the screens at the same time. First we had Marvel fans vs DC fans, and now we have BvS fans vs SS fans. what is this stupidity. cant we get excited for both SS and BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,why we have to wait so long to see this masterpiece?
CmRih_VtVAs,"In Jesus we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. And there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. God is love, and He loves you so much that He payed, and died for your sins on that cross so that you may be liberated from them and gain eternal life and favour from God ."

CmRih_VtVAs,Absolutely horrible music choice for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Leto is the coolest joker ever. I did enjoy ledger; but ss has Leto seemingly insane. rather than simply mad and angry.
CmRih_VtVAs,My uncles friend worked on this movie :) darryl stawychny he also worked on pacific rim!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Don't get me wrong, this was a well-done trailer, but ultimately I don't think the movie will be much good... WAY too much is happening in this film, there are too many characters and I think the film will collapse under it's over-bloated weight. Also, really not digging Leto's Joker or Robbie's Harley Quinn..."
CmRih_VtVAs,what harly said at 1:02?
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07-Looks (Nods head) ""Nice"" :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Haven't seen anything similar to this trailer. Unique, especially love soundtrack"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yess bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so fucking hyped for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,cool!
CmRih_VtVAs,When the fuck did Harley become an edgy Juliet starling?
CmRih_VtVAs,I love black guys...they are so big down there!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"explosions!!
COLOURS!!!!
MARGOT ROBBIE'S BUTT!!!!   :D  2:07"
CmRih_VtVAs,HowdyC  Brevo! skinny blink What's your opinion abowt !!
CmRih_VtVAs,26 milhões em 5dias
CmRih_VtVAs,i'll just wait for its BRrip in the *net haha
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh Mah Gawd QUEEN! I already love this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie mercury brought me here.....
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,sólo este tráiler ya es mejor que los vengadores
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith just ruins this movies - by being in it! - ugh.. why don't you try taking a different role and be an actual actor instead of a cliché... board.
CmRih_VtVAs,isn't margot too pretty for the role? honest question
CmRih_VtVAs,Karen Fukuhara looks cool and beautiful as Katana. It is her debut on the big screen. Hope she plays well.
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian!
CmRih_VtVAs,Pumped !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"*First trailer*
Batman v Superman: ""Holy shit it looks awesome!""
Suicide Squad: ""Eh, it looks ok. I just want to see Joker and Harley""
*Second trailer*
Batman v Superman: ""Eh, it looks ok.""
Suicide Squad:  ""I WANT TO SEE THE FUCKING MOVIE!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn I miss Heath Ledger! Not because of Jared Leto but because he was just reaching his acting prime.
CmRih_VtVAs,Lunatic Fringe by Red Rider should have been used for the Suicide Squad trailer instead of Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen since that was already used in Wayne's World.
CmRih_VtVAs,this is like guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Huh, I never cover this stuff on my blog or channel. I'm stuck in the past lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Showed a bit too much, but I guess it's on me for not resisting watcing the trailer. Looks good, way more excited for this than the Bat vs Superman ..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Both DC fanboys AND marvel fanboys are ridiculous. It's not rocket science to like both
CmRih_VtVAs,will fucking smith !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,...I think I'll skip this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Are you shitting me?

This is amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,why do i feel like the trailer is similar to infamous?
CmRih_VtVAs,The witch is hot ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait !!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Im just kidding... thats not what they said""
I was laughing so much at that part
I cant wait for this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Ouuuuu yeahhhhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 would be ending fast!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto looks fuckin spooky as the Joker. I CANNOT wait for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't wait omg
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Ain't no Rest for the Wicked"" by Cage the Elephant would have been relevant here."
CmRih_VtVAs,MARIHUANA
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE LOOKS REALLY GOOD OMG!!!!!!!!!! : ]
CmRih_VtVAs,the trailer looks good but.this music does not fit this at all.....URGH...
CmRih_VtVAs,My guess is that the girl with zero powers defeats the villain after all
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or does Harley Quinn seem way less cool and way more annoying in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:25 I love her voice, cannot wait to see her more in the movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is amazing !
CmRih_VtVAs,Надо глянуть
CmRih_VtVAs,Dc fans always say that DC is for grown-ups but this trailer made the movie look like a PG movie
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy sh!t!! This will be my graduation present :)
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant wait ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm exited for everything!
 I'm exited Ryan Reynolds gets to finally do his dream job and do Deadpool Justice for us all! I'm exited for finally getting a theatrical incarnation of Civil War and the Russos are doing their magic again, I'm exited for Batman V superman... how could you not be?!  I'm exited we will get the final X-men chapter with Apocalypse, I'm exited for Suicide Squad I mean David Ayer is doing is A game here! just look at it! and let's not forget Doctor Strange!
I feel confident that cinematic cancer like Fantastic 4 is behind us, Spider-Man is no longer in the clutches of Avi Arad, and DC finally reaise we were craving Justice League goodness for ages. this is the final hoorah for comic book movies and this year is a pivotal year, where DC gets to prove us comic book fans that their cinematic universe can also be a reality!
if Comic Book movies won't be with us forever, we can always count on the latest and greatest to give closure to an amazing era in cinema. this is what Hollywood was created for: to be a factory that brings our nerd dreams to fruition, to breath life into America's mythology."
CmRih_VtVAs,I have newfound faith for this movie. It certainly looks like they're having fun in this trailer. Glad to see this movie isn't taking itself too seriously.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the song with it
CmRih_VtVAs,yyyyyaaaawwwwnnnnnnnn
CmRih_VtVAs,Surprised that no one has noticed that the shot when the Joker is surrounded by his weapons on the floor he doesn't seem to have his silver teeth or tattoos on his face ? Interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,The bit where the Joker falls into the chemicals made my jaw drop.
CmRih_VtVAs,i feel like bohemian rhapsody made the whole thing better
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is incredible, but I want some of the characters to feel tragic. We can see that the're kind of going with this, with Deadshot punching away his sorrow, plus staring at the rain, and El Diablo closing his hand with a form of sorrow over coming him. Other characters, such as Harley, should feel much more insane."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Judging by the scene where the joker jumps into that pool that Harley's in and the scene of them riding around in his car, it's looking like the squad is sent to kill the joker, but Harley betrays them and joins him because they fall in love
Or it's a trailer and no one knows jack shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,crap movie for crap ppl
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks like rubbish to me, nothing but one giant cliche of your typical movie tropes."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can we all just admit this looks better than BvS. I mean theres some still mystery with this film
CmRih_VtVAs,It's soooooo near my birthday!!! I feel like this movie is going to be my birthday gift <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just look at the Joker's expression when he says ""I can't wait to show you my toys."" Haunting."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm more excited about SQ than BvS becuase it seems like BvS wil be just setting for their new movie Universe, while SQ seems to have an actual story, an actual script, and we're probably going to see some serious acting from several of the cast members."
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie looks retarded
CmRih_VtVAs,100 раз уже пересмотрел
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one digging the Joker's laughter at 1:28 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song called
CmRih_VtVAs,"All I want to hear is Harley say ""Mistah J"", at least once."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,0:54 slade wilson
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley is brilliant, insane and sexy as she is very anxious to see the best villain in theaters, Margot is perfect as Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,well this looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Why i find this Joker so sexy Jesus Christ *.*
CmRih_VtVAs,is that scott eastwood im seeing??? 😎😏
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn why so many dislikes?I thought it looked like it will be really good. The joker looks like he's gonna be the most fun character to watch
of course lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dn why so many dislikes? i think this version of the joker will be fkn great.
They know they can't get the same kind of joker they has in  Dark Night 
Nobody will be able to play that role after him lol
had to go with a more comic type of joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is going to be a good movie...now having Margot Robbie play Harley Quinn is a great thing... same goes for Will Smith playing Deadshot, and Jared Leto playing The Joker...who knows, he might be good as Heath Ledger was ( maybe )...the actor playing Killer Croc is Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje ( formerly known as Adebisi from the old HBO show OZ & Mr. Eko from LOST ) for those don't know or remember him...IMO this could be more anticipated than all of the Marvel movies coming out, maybe except for Deadpool...Outside of Suicide Squad & Batman vs Superman, I wonder what else DC might be planning to put out"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is amazing.  The perfect blend of parts of the movie and music.  Kudos to the producers of the trailer.  Hope the movie is as good as the trailer.  Already hearing that Deadpool lives up to the hype.  Hoping SS does too.
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman was to busy fighting Superman during the making of this film
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this too many times in a row
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be amazing. Best trailer ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,is it me or does Harley Quinn look like Anne Hathaway
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know The songname Please?

CmRih_VtVAs,"just within the week it already beat batman v superman trailer  2. I'm still definitely going to watch batman v superman but this trailer did a better job with its marketing and not turning some fans off. good trailer in my opinion for Warnerbros, not too much, lil different, just right"
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,"Has anyone figure out what Harley says when she's in the car with Joker? It sounds like Joe or Jo? Or maybe it's just 'stop' or 'don't' or 'go' or something, I don't know, just trying to figure out because I wonder if in this movie she'll call him Jo XD I would hope that we'll hear Mistah J and puddin' though."
CmRih_VtVAs,who made these trailers? just give him a promotion already.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guardians of the Galaxy 2 looks pretty good!  Oh wait...what?  This isn't Guardians of the Galaxy 2?....heh, sorry.....the voices.  I'm just kidding, that's not what they said........yes, they did."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone notice the red and black heels (maybe nodding to Harley's classic suit) at around 1:29?
CmRih_VtVAs,One motivation for watching the movie....BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY💞👏
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've never been excited for a ""superhero"" movie like I am for this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is going to be better than bvs, civil war or deadpool, I guarantee it."
CmRih_VtVAs,never thought i'd see the day where the joker looks like the weakest link in a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer has to beat 50 shades of grey trailer views!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,that white hair chick were cute. whats her name?
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here!
CmRih_VtVAs,J
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of the music at 1:09 - 1:32 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,tattooed man is the tentacle thing in the subway scene
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddy Mercury brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,I just lost my last brain cells. what a piece of crap
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here.

CmRih_VtVAs,awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Where can get the song which starts at 1:40?
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:28 Every time I hear that Joker laugh, can't help but get shivers and goosebumps"
CmRih_VtVAs,were bad guys! its what we do.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sometimes  find that I am too happy in life, then I watch this to remind me that all hope is lost.
...all hope is lost."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer gave me the chills
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait for this
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer killed a lot of concerns I had with this movie, but I'm still worried about Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn."
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh marvel , you got something coming at you."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,whos the blonde
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel needs to step up their game after this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought it would be about ISIS XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"So can we talk about how I think Killer Croc is the one who dies in this movie? He assaults Katana and when Harley Quinn says ""whoaaa"", he's not in the line up and everyone looks already severely battered and lost articles of clothing."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Some of the dialogue is a little predictable and cliche, but otherwise, it looks like some good action."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm crying.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see they don't use Deadshot's full mask through the whole movie. Hollywood, don't be scared to cover the actors faces in comic book movies. We know who is under there just stay true to the look."
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Harley uses the New York/New Jersey accent - I didn't hear it in this clip : (

CmRih_VtVAs,LoL
CmRih_VtVAs,Hands up for Freddie Mercury.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's one of the best trailers I've ever seen. I've must've watched it like 15 times already.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see this movie... This is the best trailer i ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn doesn't give a fuck about your feels, DC haters."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Christ, has no one seen fucking Wayne's World?  Is all of Youtube under 14?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer for some odd reason has too much of a GOTG vibe to it. Perhaps it's the strong emphasis on the music?
Either way I think the Joker is going to make this movie and Will smith is going to be a great anchor to keep the humanity to it all."
CmRih_VtVAs,jaredleto😏
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm absolutely fine with everything they're doing here, with the exception of one thing, quite minute compared to other complaints and dislikes, but being a massive Killer Croc fan, I love the way they represent his crocodilian features in this new version, but he just isn't big enough, height and physique wise, I mean, come on, for being the powerhouse of the squad, you'd think he'd at least be the tallest in the group, but he's not even that! I don't know, maybe the movie has something up its sleeve in terms of his ""evolution"" throughout the movie, who knows, regardless, that's my opinion, just had to get that out there"
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched this 4 times. I'm definitely watching it opening day!
CmRih_VtVAs,Here for Cara.. 🙌💕
CmRih_VtVAs,the most awesome song brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,How on earth do I start reading this? Do I have to read other comics first or like what?
CmRih_VtVAs,A lot of these scenes are from the first look but the difference in song makes it totally different in tone. Bohemian Rhapsody turning killers into comedians since 2015.
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE DC <3 What a time we live in! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait to see this. Really loving harley quinn, looking sexy as hell"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't believe I'm living to see this it's crazy bruh lol
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is that?
CmRih_VtVAs,how come of all the things people notice and talk about this movie is not towards how the trailer shows how awesome Kitana's soultaker looks
CmRih_VtVAs,That's going to be good

i thought there were more Marvel fans out there than that?"
CmRih_VtVAs,The more and more I watch this trailer the more and more I think it's the best trailer of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,The MV for Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,where is saitama?
CmRih_VtVAs,one of the best trailer i ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks good, and unlike 99% of the 12 year olds posting here, I actually BOUGHT and READ the DC Comic book written by JOHN OSTRANDER in 1987."

CmRih_VtVAs,Came to check when its showing >>> watched the trailer and got too excited I forgot to check

I'm so proud in American's movie

CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED TO WATCH THIS
CmRih_VtVAs,"When Harley is jumping on the rope that looks like a rope hanging from a helicopter, the joker is probably flying it and was probably gonna leave her behind as if the place was gonna blow up but she ran and jumped to hang on. As she is completely love blinded with the joker haha. That's my guess. Man im hella hyped for this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,great soundtrack

CmRih_VtVAs,#suïcide sguad
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, the first trailer, although an awesome trailer, there was no explosions or nothing which made it look cheap to me, but this trailer is brilliant. Tons of explosions, helicopters, bad ass moves and that NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! 👌 Legit awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,the voice was dubbed by heath ledger from heaven..:3
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn and Joker...two reasons why this movie is a must watch.
CmRih_VtVAs,The song itself is better than this trailer.

CmRih_VtVAs,a bilada vai cantar

CmRih_VtVAs,I think i always imagined Britney Murphy as Harley Quinn. So its quite odd for me to see Margot Robbie in that role..hope see does well in that role..
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how much Will Smith got paid by WB in an attempt to give credibility to this crap.
CmRih_VtVAs,the new joker is going to be on another level. It's nice to see a psycho joker for once :D
CmRih_VtVAs,This will smack Star Wars The Farce Awakens for 6. THIS WILL BE THE HIGHEST GROSSING FILM EVER

CmRih_VtVAs,"You know I don't know what some of you complaining about maybe it has something to do with Will Smith boycotting Oscars, but the biggest plus about this is its NOT ANOTHER FUCKING REBOOT!!!!!!! THANK GOD!"
CmRih_VtVAs,That ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Beautiful trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,looks likes guardian of galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,This is everything!! Queen touch makes it epic and not just a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY QUINN IS HOT! 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is Harley Quinn baby voice ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else fricking loves to chosen song for this! *Michael Rosen* Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,When I see Harley and Joker I see actors trying to play a character. I don't see the actual characters come to life.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:40 take that feminism.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, that's what we do"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK BECAUSE IM PERSONALLY SICK OF SEEING PEOPLE ASK THE SAME QUESTION OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS IS WHO IS IN THE SUICIDE SQUAD:
Slipknot
Captain Boomerang
Enchantress
Katana
Rick Flag
Harely Quin
DeadShot
Killer croc
El diablo

and obviously special guest
The joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,what song?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks great!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still wondering the running time of this movie. I'm betting 2 hours 43 minutes including end credits. Wht abt u guys?
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck bvs suicide squad will be much better
CmRih_VtVAs,lol any one notice that margot robbie's ass look like a 12 yr olds booty lmfao when she hitting the window? also i think im going to like this movie the one the thats bothering me a bit is that Harley Quinn doesn't look to have her infamous Brooklyn accent i hope that she has one or at least a high pitched quirky voice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Since David Ayer said he made batman fight, I hope its against the whole squad like the animated movie... now that my friends would be fucking epic. But then again he could just be a flash back memory of harley or joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to watch this movie!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn the movie. Featuring some other villains and some Joker flashbacks
CmRih_VtVAs,"I always cringe when people say ""bad guys"" especially when someone calls themselves ""bad guys''"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did anyone else notice, at 1:30, bottom left of the picture, all those little packets? These look like 23 packs of c4. 23 little packets of fiery, explosive, doom. I can't even begin to think the kind of damage these would do. I really want them to be c4. I really want to see the ultimate ""WTFNOPE"" look on Batman's, Deadshot's, or Flag's face."
CmRih_VtVAs,As if this trailer needed any boost in the number of views. You add this song as background track!
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, which one happen first? BvS or SS?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This awesome 
Me lo he visto mas de 10 veces"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queens dont stop me now couldve been a better choce
CmRih_VtVAs,My kind of super Hero shit!
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG SO I'M LITERALLY CRYING BECAUSE THIS TRAILER LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE, BUT I THOUGHT THE SAME ABOUT JOY AND THE ONLY GOOD THING IN THAT SHITTY MOVIE IS JENNIFER LAWRENCE'S ASS, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ENTERTAIN ME, SINCE I'M A GIRL

Dont Fck Me"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why? Why Bohemian Rhapsody? It doesn't fit, it's Freddie's masterpiece and deserves more respect.😫😫"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This better be a good movie if you fuckers have the guts to use that song in the TRAILER. If not, god speed to you & yours for the Internet's wrath has no mortal limit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me the song in the trailer?  PLEASE ITS SO CATCHY
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer is like a huge badass party
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What was that? I should kill everyone and escape?"" -Harley Quinn 2016"

CmRih_VtVAs,Never been so excited for a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,she fits harley quinn so perfect im in love
CmRih_VtVAs,i watched this 3 times
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else feel like Margot Robbie is kinda not bringing it in these scenes?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm most excited to see this! I especially love how Margot's Harley is shaping up!

I know there are critics that don't like her voice, and I say fahrvergnügen. I think about that shitty WB/CE Batman cartoon where Joker looked like Blanka. And in that cartoon, Harley had that Queens accent, but good god was she annoying on that show! Margot's is the reverse: may not have the accent, but she's got the spirit."
CmRih_VtVAs,nice...;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone here to see Harley Quinn ?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate this harley O.o

CmRih_VtVAs,1:15. Every fucking movie will
CmRih_VtVAs,That's not a harley queen voice
CmRih_VtVAs,I watch this twice a day since it released.
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my God this is gonna be so sick!!

CmRih_VtVAs,I absolutely love that they're using Queen's song♡
CmRih_VtVAs,Copy-paste of guardians of the galaxy ...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think we would all want Black Manta, King Shark, Deathstroke and Killer Frost in the sequel"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow Ike is an extra!!! sad :(
CmRih_VtVAs,Planning giveaway need subscriber
CmRih_VtVAs,A Swedish actor 😍 Joel
CmRih_VtVAs,Since then Joker is the Best Valiant in DC comics he's the best.
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,The girl at 0:11 looks like Diandra Soares from BiggBoss8
CmRih_VtVAs,Where the fuck is Captain boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is so cute compared to the others.
CmRih_VtVAs,Now I know Fredie's rhapsody is schyzophrenic as hell :)
CmRih_VtVAs,That's How you make a Trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the guy at 01:44 getting wrecked by the train?
CmRih_VtVAs,Visit
CmRih_VtVAs,noooooo i wish Tom Hardy wouldn't have dropped out ):
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know why but I have watched this trailer at least 40 times! I just love it! As much as I love Batman and Superman-for some reason I'm getting more excited for this! Why people why???????????????????
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm kinda disappointed? I had like the highest hope for this one when the teaser came out and now it just feels mediocre.
CmRih_VtVAs,that logo reminds me of scene culture :(
CmRih_VtVAs,Still surprise Will Smith is doing a superhero movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Great year for DC!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks pretty terrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,who is that on 1:59
CmRih_VtVAs,this had so much potential..... and then shit actors existed
CmRih_VtVAs,"The funny thing people forget to realize is that this song, must commonly interpreted about a man convicted of murder and sentenced life in prison, but the song is actually about Homosexuality and being shunned by the Church.. Read the Lyrics."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I will not be taking my smallest and sweetest son hunter to see this film, it seems far too deranged and I do not need my son to see a mirror held to our society just yet. I will show him that mirror myself on his 18th birthday so that I know he will be safe while he gazes. I just can't stand the thought of something happening to him"
CmRih_VtVAs,"When did Katana become A Villain???

Batman & the Outsiders she wasn't (I'm SO carbon dating myself lol) enlighten me plz..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't like Harley. She acts silly, not crazy. And her lines are cheesy. I was expecting a lot more from Margot. 
Joker does look totally insane, he's the main reason I'm watching this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,#HailGrasa
CmRih_VtVAs,I hear a slight Heath ledger's joker voice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Rick flag: deadshot, he shoots people…hes a crocodile,he eats people…he burns people and youre possessed by a witch and shes just crazy!!!
My point is rick flag knows enchantress is a witch and he still bangs her, looks to me shes mind controlling everybody on joker's orders plus she was in the black house and some ones bedroom so slipknot is the first to die, im gonna masturbate to harley quinn and idolize captain boomerang
Deadshot sucks donkey balls and el diablo looked cool but seriously though and can opening sound in the middle of a battle wow Boomer mate i salute ya my good mate …shrimp on the barbie"
CmRih_VtVAs,The time has come for the supervillain to take charge of saving the world.
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my god! They use a legend song!
CmRih_VtVAs,Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney will form a separate team whose sole mission is to ruin this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,The REAL fact of this movie is this will never top star wars and thats the truth!Looks interesting though.
CmRih_VtVAs,gee i wish they'd remind us a few more times that they're bad guys. talk about 'forced'.
CmRih_VtVAs,behomaien rapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Enchantress is the real X factor here. She is stupidly powerful.  She's a Zatanna level sorceress.
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn it all looks good!
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's awesome that Adabisi is Killer Croc, Oz lives again. The prison shut down, they turned it into Arkham Asylum. They performed horrible experiments on Adabisi and he ends up getting mutated into Killer Croc."
CmRih_VtVAs,omg.....that was fucking awesome......fuck fuck fuck.....so many fucks given to this trailer....
CmRih_VtVAs,Boycott Will Smiff
CmRih_VtVAs,the guy who played DeadShot in Arrow is much better than Will Smith. DC should have used him to play DeadShot is suicide Squad. just like Marvel that uses the same actor/actress to play characters in every TV show and Movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Let me outta here darlin....please!
CmRih_VtVAs,Great Movie. But the SOUND IS ONE OF THE GREATEST!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Goodbye, everybody."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 2:30 with caption..

""*How you feel when yo girl's head game so strong*""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this meant to be the dc counterpart to deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,"Deadpool and SS are my most anticipated comic book movies this year! Don't get me wrong; I'm sure BvS and Civil War will be terrific, and I have full confidence in Apocalypse. But the first two I mentioned look out of the norm and full of attitude."
CmRih_VtVAs,Spoiler alert: Batman shows up at the end and kicks all of their asses.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith's name in front of Jared Leto's... 

Fuck Will Smith."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ugh.. gotta wait until August?? Sad Face... :(
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one that thinks this movie is shit?
CmRih_VtVAs,over rated!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for this than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,"See, the first teaser/trailer was boring and dark. THIS one has me genuinely hyped."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks way more interesting than Batman v Superman. BvS screams tried hard fail to me. Thats probably why they rewrote it and got it away from Civil war a much better premise that isn't just ""Cap vs Ironman."""
CmRih_VtVAs,But the song better be used in the movie at some point.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks amazing 😆😆👍🏼
CmRih_VtVAs,Will be epic!
CmRih_VtVAs,god damn! that's EDGY
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is so hot
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like I just watched half of the movie. Also, weren't there only like five of them in the original trailer or something? Now they've just taken a stack of comics and hurled it at the screen."
CmRih_VtVAs,Like because of the soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,"As far as generic trailers with horrible jokes go, that was absolutely nauseating.
Could be the good movie in the end, you know like bad trailer - good movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 is my favorite scene of all. Yeah, I'm bad guy and that's what I do :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is just a really weird guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,joker has a fucking grill i can't believe this
CmRih_VtVAs,good

CmRih_VtVAs,"I legit had goosebumps while watching this.

CmRih_VtVAs,Seems too much like a copy of Guardians of the Galaxy :/
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara ❤️😍
CmRih_VtVAs,That moment when a movie about villains fighting villains is more hyped than a movie about the world strongest man and the greatest detective fight
CmRih_VtVAs,No Brooklyn accent for Harley? *DISAPPOINTED!*
CmRih_VtVAs,A DC-comics movie without a ton of exposition and preachy dialogue(well at least so far)? HALLELUJAH!!! DC you have renewed my faith in you!

CmRih_VtVAs,"If you're comparing Joker to the previous movie Jokers then slap yourself. They are all different.

CmRih_VtVAs,"People are judging Suicide Squad wayyy to much! This movie looks more promising then Daredevil Season 2. It is keeping to the lore of the comics! Also this isnt the 60s' anymore, the looks follow the characters in Squad comics. Jared Leto looks awesome. My favorite fictional character, and he looks badass. And for anyone who says he doesnt look classy or not like the joker, have you seen the new trailer???? He is wearing a suit in every shot. Next to that does anyone remember the comic where the Joker cut his face off and wears it as a mask???? I do, wasn't so classy then... Harley looks great and Margot Robbie is perfect as her. Enchantress' magic being shown looks awesome, Killer Croc not being CGI is awesome, Deadshot looks amazing. Casting is on point, looks are on point, vibe is on point, that Trailer was on point. Then Again Im going to be the one guy that doesnt like Deadpool and loves Suicide Squad. I would love to hear other people's thoughts on this."
CmRih_VtVAs,pfff Ithought it was a movie about bad guys doing bad stuff... not saving the world. Wont watch sorry.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the bitch from paper towns in this? Looks like her
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think I know the cast now, you've got Will Smith as Deadshot, Jared Leto as The Joker, Margot Robbie as Harley, Adewale Akinnouye- Agbaje as Killer Croc, Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Karen Fukuhara as Katana, Jay Hernandaz as El Diablo, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Common as Tattooed Man, Adam Beach as Slipknot, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, Ben Affleck as Batman, Jim Parrick as Joker's Top Henchman, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. Is that it or did I miss some?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh hell Ye!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am liking  letos joker, it feels like the comic joker, unfortunately, still not convinced with harley..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I still feel like the casting for Rick Flag and Deadshot is completely backwards.
CmRih_VtVAs,"for all those who want to know the name of the song it is
""stairway to the highway to hotel rhapsody"" by justin minaj"

CmRih_VtVAs,DAMN I LOVE BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why do these post Nolan DC films look so damn cheap? They look really really cheap. I'm concerned about this,the concept is great but the execution... idk. Harley's dialogue is cringeworthy,i'm hating her already. Also,the thing i hated the most was the use of that one Queen song(which happens to be one of me favs),it makes them look desperate. Oh boy,lets hope this won't be another flop. I'm already sick of Marvel and DC keeps releasing shitty movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,It's weird how the first trailer is so dark and brooding and now this trailer is off the walls whacky and happy!

CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck yes I can't wait to see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,damn it almost sounds like they made bohemian rhapsody for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,YOUNG STREET TORONTO!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song? I love it
CmRih_VtVAs,August???
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith as Deadshot looking worse and worse. At least for anyone who has read the comics.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie is going to bring back 12-year-old scene girls who joke about ""the voices"" and use the :3 emoticon. the world will once again be the hell that it was in 2007"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad or batman vs superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,boomerang remainds me of Bronson(Tom Hardy)
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a lot of fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,that joker gives me the creeps that means job well done Jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,This Joker reminds me of the one from the cartoons. The Mark Hamil Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's like it somehow looks really good and really bad at the exact same time. Like, if you take it completely seriously, then it just looks horrible, but if you look at it as a fun, over-the-top thing that shouldn't be taken really seriously at all, then it actually looks at least sort of enjoyable.
But not Leto's Joker. As much as the advertisements insist that ""ohh, jeez, the Joker is so dark and edgy !!1!!1!"", he's honestly the least interesting part of the trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,"only white people shoot up schools, white people should not be allowed to have guns!"
CmRih_VtVAs,George Bush did 9/11.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 You know Captain Boomerang's an Aussie when he stops for a beer! hahaha...
CmRih_VtVAs,the worst hero ever is not them IT'S DEADPOOL
CmRih_VtVAs,my heroes <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"song name?





haha jk I dont have a death wish"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still a bit iffy about Jared, but I know I'll be wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,"i think i just saw Emma Watson, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"l luv this trailer looks good, its better then the first trailer ... opposite from bvs they look in the first trailer but very bad on the second trailer.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Out of the whole trailer why does Enchantress leave me with the best impression? She only had one line ""Let's do something fun."" I guess it's because I feel it's the best written line seen in the  trailer IMO"
CmRih_VtVAs,"can't stop replying super villian DIRTY DOZEN.
O FUCKING YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Carefully optimistic.
CmRih_VtVAs,look at this. we’re gonna have to relive some dark times. myspace is about to make a comeback. preps will have to hide in fear once again. the hot topic CEO is rubbing his hands together as i’m typing this. get ready for thousands of deviant art suicide squad ocs complete with scene hair and too many belts.
CmRih_VtVAs,Almost 25 Million Holy
CmRih_VtVAs,hey on 1:58 you see Harley quinn become white
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am i the only one watching this for the 300th time

:)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait for the scene when batfleck tells joker to eat his broccoli, and joker screams: ""YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD!"" and storms off to his room to post about it in his tumblr."
CmRih_VtVAs,this is nothing like the suicide squad from the arrow
CmRih_VtVAs,whose squad is this? yours? mine? together?
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant stop watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's gonna be great.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh my, oh my! This Joker's laugh might be my second favorite of all time (after Hamill's of course). The overall look of the Joker is bullcrap topped with some diarrea but the personality and character traits seem spot on. This looks more exciting tan Batman V Superman honestly"
CmRih_VtVAs,"IT'S SO COOL! Well except for the Joker, he looks like a retarded kid who fell right into the bleach, then was raped by The Hulk and then got his braces done; just before being kidnapped by the guys who appear in Tatto Nightmares. Seriously, when I say he should be destroyed, I'm talking Megatons. 
Everything else, pretty sweet so far."
CmRih_VtVAs,As someone who grew up with Nolan joker this new one looks a bit weirder but I think He'll do fine
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pretty hyped for this movie until I saw Cara Delevingne! No hate, but really? She's not really good at acting"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, I'm going to be the first to edmit it. When I first saw the Comic-con trailer, I did not feel the hype. I thought: Well this looks like it's going to be okay.
But now... HOLY SHIT, THIS IS AWESOME!!!!! I have changed my mind about this! I feel sooooooo hyped now, and I have to wait to August? Well, what can you do?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This actually looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,who plays Killer Croc? And who is the fire villain and who plays him?
CmRih_VtVAs,is that TOM HARDY?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think I saw Scott Eastwood, maybe that's just me....."
CmRih_VtVAs,This HYPE TRAIN is gonna hurt really... really bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Heroes. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks fucking awful
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM SO HAPPY.

CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemia rapsodia :3 *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer got me excited, but this new trailer has now distracted me with all of their bad acting."
CmRih_VtVAs,The song goes well with the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is BANE he better be in the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is poppin with that handbag!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey you guys please subscribe to my channel I have four subscribers so proud, so proud"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish will smith wasnt in this movie at all, i dont feel like he is a good fit.... i hope im wrong tho"
CmRih_VtVAs,"worst movie ever
but it has will smith in it SO IT IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE YERRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
CmRih_VtVAs,tittle of songs
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer makes it look like it's going to be more of a marvel-type movie, meaning it looks like it's going to be appealing to 13 year old girls and it's going to be predictable"
CmRih_VtVAs,At least this Joker looks like he showers.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who all of the bad guys. All I know is the joker that it who the rest
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Queen plays
Me: Okay, this is gonna be a good trailer..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanted to see king shark eat yo-yo :(
CmRih_VtVAs,#squadgoals
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that Will Smith or Commander Shepard? Lost.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 One rule of battle: Never give an AK-47 to a madman!
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how funny this movie would have been if Harley Quinn's character was played by a gay guy LMAO
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,"civil war, batman vs superman and suicide squad? holy crap this is my freakin year."
CmRih_VtVAs,This actually looks pretty cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,Not really a fan of DC but this movie is something to watch.
CmRih_VtVAs,great... Cara delevigne is in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I see a little silhouette of a bat
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else see super man at 3:27
CmRih_VtVAs,my favorite part of this trailer is at 2:07.
CmRih_VtVAs,"That was beautiful, now please make the second official trailer with Dont Stop me now by Queen, PLEASE!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not saying Leto Joker will be the best Joker, but judging from this trailer, we are all in for a treat this August!!! I can't wait to see his new toys!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,waka waka waka
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm curious. Is joker part of the Suicide Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG 😍😍😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why, but I LOVE that font!"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is trying to make a fun movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Would anyone else Tongue punch the crap out of Margot Robbie's anus. or is it just me?
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad > Civil War.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whenever Harley Quin said ""Hey boys,"" it reminded me of the Batman v Superman trailer when Lex Luthor said, ""Boys"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't fucking wait
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this
CmRih_VtVAs,like this one better then last one
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsodi!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"FLAPPY BIRD 2 IS OUT NOW
FLAPPY2 ( ANDROID )
FLAP 2 GREEN BIRD ( IOS )"
CmRih_VtVAs,jared♥♥ our new joker★
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is gonna be so good there is no words for it,  just wish harleys voice was higher pitched like the cartoons etc,  but meh,  cant wait,"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:38 yeaaaah
CmRih_VtVAs,tapped on this trailer. tapped home button to turn off music player. Turns out I wasn't the one playing bohemian rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,looks way better than Batman v Superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,I really don't know. I hope this is either really out there or it will just be crappy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn voice should be higher
CmRih_VtVAs,"HOLY SHIT, cant wait to see it"
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks better than Batman v Superman. it may just be me, but this is also a little confusing: the suicide squad is made to let villains work down their prison time by doing jobs soldiers and heroes can't/wont do. I get that. it seems like the Joker is the villain turned leader of the group (whose team seems to be mainly Batman characters) but what with the katana wielding woman? isnt she an ally of Batman? it feels like there are three or four factions here. I guess ill just have to watch it...instead of Batman v Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""WE'RE BAD GUYS THIS IS WHAT WE DO"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I CANT WAIT TO SHOW MY TOYS"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"O FUCKING YEAH

CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad. Where bad is the new good...
CmRih_VtVAs,that booty ..... woww :P
CmRih_VtVAs,This should stay the Wayne's World OST and nothing else. Doesn't fit at all...
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's official: According to YouTube, this trailer has more views in 4 days than in BvS's trailer #2 in 2 months.  Suicide Squad wins again. 
1:39-2:05 is just flawless editing and the best rockin part of that song."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow! This looks awesome! Looking forward to new superheroes. Now I know what my character shall be for Halloween, Harley. Heck why wait...start now"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is Bohemian Rhapsody from Queen 😁
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM ERECT
CmRih_VtVAs,The drinking scene is funny!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC fans  be like Batman v Superman & Suicide Squad what a year what a lovely year.
CmRih_VtVAs,I THINK IM IN LOVE😍
CmRih_VtVAs,is Harley dying at 1:58 ? ! ?
CmRih_VtVAs,DC made a trailer that did't Spoil the Whole movie?.. Good for them Give the people who made this trailer a raise.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the joker not have his scares on his cheeks
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that ksi lambo
CmRih_VtVAs,bla bla bla PG 08 ! lol
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks like a Christmas movie

CmRih_VtVAs,I need to watch this NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,FRIGGING SICKKKKK!
CmRih_VtVAs,that JOKER is a JOKE?
CmRih_VtVAs,two words : CAN'T WAIT !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can wait to show you my toys!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn so much XD Literally my only complaint is the voice could be a little better.
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of this song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I get the look of the Joker now, this entire film is on crack."
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks like some campy crap from the 90's
CmRih_VtVAs,Hmmm..just 7 months to go....First Star Wars and now this. Hollywood torturing my sanity
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 Joker's back looks nasty as fuck!
CmRih_VtVAs,is suicide squad dc or marvel (sorry I'm Uncultured )
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the name of the song I forgot but I really like it and I know its by queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Superheroes? Check! Psychotic? Check! Old school music classics? Check! Please add a bow and arrow...
Could you imagine a movie about a sane, regular day hero on a modern pop track?"
CmRih_VtVAs,this kind of movie need a hard r rating just like deapools
CmRih_VtVAs,BRAZZZIIIIILLLLLLLLLL
CmRih_VtVAs,a wismichu no le gusta gusta esto
CmRih_VtVAs,Who saw Iron Man strangling Captain America at 2:33?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 I have just realised that Harleys hair colour could be the residue from Jokers jacket
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is nailing the role..
CmRih_VtVAs,damn i love this song
CmRih_VtVAs,margot Robbie ♥♥
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 is where we see Dick Grayson AKA NightWing. It's the man on the right
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sure i'm going to have the same problem with this that i did with Man of steel cause for everything i loved there was something i hated. like i like Deadshot and Killer croc, there seems to be some good humour to it but then Joker and Harley quinn don't seem like Joker and Harley they act like Scene kids. that think there edgy like no one runs around telling people there ""Bad guys"" your not going to find any legitimate crook admit that. it just seems of.... i'm just really really mixed on this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really like Harley Quinnm she is an amazing character in the comics but I'm really not liking what I;ve seen of her in these trailers, I get the feeling they're just making her a ditzy, sexualised stereotype rather than the genius and interesting character that she is"
CmRih_VtVAs,omg bohemian rhapsody i love this
CmRih_VtVAs,Open the gate me at home hen I get told to go to school
CmRih_VtVAs,0uuu
CmRih_VtVAs,Liked because Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that another song would be more appropiate than Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hu2
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi
CmRih_VtVAs,finally the movie that DC needs and DC fans deserve
CmRih_VtVAs,Will this movie get an R-Rating or PG-13?
CmRih_VtVAs,what this trailer needs. ...is alot of COW BELL!
CmRih_VtVAs,"deadpool should join....(and i no hes marvel so dont comment ""well hes marvel stupid"" it was a joke)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This video has more likes than Captain America: Civil War, but Civil War has more views than Suicide Squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith... Ugh...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm indifferent in terms of the whole ""Marvel vs DC"" thing, but this movie is going to be a ton of fun regardless."
CmRih_VtVAs,What/who is that at 1:44??
CmRih_VtVAs,showed the whole movie ffs
CmRih_VtVAs,We see Capt Boomerang but don't see him using any boomerangs.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS LOOKS SO DOPE
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite thing about the trailer is how it syncs with the song just I'M HYPED!
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 was the best. Cant wait to se it in 3D
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is killing it! No joke.
CmRih_VtVAs,01:18 your welcome

CmRih_VtVAs,wasent croc supposed to be 8feet tall green and not yellow?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow... Love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Awful song choice for this trailer. This movie is about a gritty envirement with psychos etc, and this shitty song makes it sound like a comedy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks epic.

but I have no idea what it's about."
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a good DC movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Song:Queen- Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will smith playing deadshot is absolutly ridiculous.Just cuz of ""diversity""( aka stupidity), they turned an originally white character black, fucking anti white leftist hollywood politics"
CmRih_VtVAs,Please tell me this move's going to be this bat-shit insane and fun as I hope it is.
CmRih_VtVAs,If the entire soundtrack is like this sign me up.
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07
CmRih_VtVAs,We ALL paused at 2:07....
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this movie allready

CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awful
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna..... suck
CmRih_VtVAs,I get the feeling this movie is going to suck. The acting is so bad especially the girl.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 who is the guy getting supposedly hit by the train? And who is the person standing in the train?
CmRih_VtVAs,Did I see Furious Pete there?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi

CmRih_VtVAs,no words can explain how much i hope this don't turn out to be terrible

CmRih_VtVAs,The most ridiculous trailer ever lol. Can't wait to see the film!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:20 Joker was talking with Rick Flag? Looks like Rick Flag.
CmRih_VtVAs,Braniac
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Lego is going to mame a great joke!!! Nothing in this world is perfect. People will a!ways find something they don't like. Personally I'm glad the joker is different how many times can we keep putting the same shit out before it gets old. I grew up on classical joker, but having a son that's 7 and loves Batman, He deserves something new just like we got as kids and grew to love. Last thing, to all the haters of new joker or superman and batflek you don't have to like them its cool but I can guarantee the people that hate the hardest probably don't have a cleaver bone in there body, are living in there parents basement and haven't had pussy since pussy had them. And as original or creative as the people who made the new fantastic four movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song they used
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker looks so cartoony... There portrayal of him is going to ruin the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate Will Smith as Deadshot. Everything else looks good though.
CmRih_VtVAs,Judging by the trailer harley quinn and deadhsot r gonna be my favs. I hope katana has a lot of screentime in the movie i really love katana
CmRih_VtVAs,They let Jinx from League of Legends star in a movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard Queen and saw Viola Davis and instantly knew that this movie is going to be good
CmRih_VtVAs,i thought it was coming out in February D:
CmRih_VtVAs,"To bad, seems like a child's movie!  :( Should be more like Watchmen.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"yeah, this in gonna suck."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks corny!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here and I'm 12
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit this is the best movie trailer yet
CmRih_VtVAs,"But how can these guys be the good guys? harley quinn, the joker?"
CmRih_VtVAs,The best trailer I have seen in my all life
CmRih_VtVAs,FINALLY!!!!!!! HARLEY QUINN IS QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,"That one in a lifetime sensation, when you are actually excited to see Jai Courtney in a movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,so are they the good guys?

CmRih_VtVAs,"The worst Joker ever, but I'm still gonna watch it because of Margot  and Will Smith ahahha"
CmRih_VtVAs,The only good thing on this trailer is the song...
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think there is any tea in that cup.
CmRih_VtVAs,ITS FUCKING RIDDLER AT 2:31 HOLY SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,Y did they have to do my boy will smith like that in the begging
CmRih_VtVAs,"There are two moments that got me hooked on this film:
1) The Joker, of course
2) That helicopter scene, missiles firing like gangbusters."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who saw the troll face at 2:32?!?!!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,that rare moment when DC released a comidic movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Take a chill pill, folks. DC hasn't ""butchered"" ""killed"" or ""ruined"" YOUR favourite characters. This is just one interpretation AMONG MANY. Each artist, writer, and fan interprets the characters in their own way. It's not like interpretations that you enjoy have suddenly been erased by Suicide Squad. All those comics, TV shows, movies, and other media still exist."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG WTF did i just watch ?!?!?....worst of the worst movie ever....:(  The best was QUIN'S  song
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yesss! Fuck Yes! I'm Loving this really, really BAD! ! !"
CmRih_VtVAs,"At first I was really scared for this, especially for Harley. I was extremely worried that she would just be a pretty face in the script, but holy crap I was wrong. I am so excited for this now."
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait anymore
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yaaaaaaaaaaaagh!!!!!!!!!! Soooo exited!! 
😄😆🙂"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well I had my doubts before, and this could be trailer magic, but this looks really incredible now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks absolutely ridiculous, and not in a good way. I'm actually really disappointed. I expected more."
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok so this trailer has in 3 days as many view as the star wars trailer had in one day.... The whole trailer has Queen music.... It appears in the same month as another movie that looked crap but it was awesome (Guardians of the Galaxy). Iluminati confirmed, this movies gonna be so damn good"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Alright, so we've got Deadshot, Harley, Killer Croc, Enchantress, Katana, Captain Boomerang and... I have no idea who the tattooed fire guy is."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared look fucking amazing in this move:)
But Wil Smith  look so boring....."
CmRih_VtVAs,It seems Jared Leto will become the best Joker (with the best Harley)
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song called?
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like its gunna b a sweet movie to watch its different atleast we haven't ree made an existing cartoon into a movie in really getting tired if that it's old keep it in the past and let's make more interesting and different movies 
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think I'm going to have to boycott this movie, there's not enough minorities in it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks freaking awesome. The Joker still looks terrible but his performance seems fantastic.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Margot Robbie could do the Harley voice I think she would be perfect. As long as she doesn't sound like the Arkham Knight Harley, she sounded too much like a baby at times."
CmRih_VtVAs,So exited for this movie😝😎😜
CmRih_VtVAs,tão foda q me arrepiei todinho aki
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG YES. CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT!
CmRih_VtVAs,FUUUCCKKKKK
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is my spirit animal
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ive ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else's video stopping at 5 sec and won't go further on multiple platforms?
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song
CmRih_VtVAs,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Suicide* *Squad* trailer 1 already, in it's first 4 days of being released, has 3 million more views than *Batman* *v* *Superman*: *Dawn* *of* *Justice*'s 2nd trailer does, which is pretty amazing considering that *BvS* 2nd trailer has had a 48-day head-start over *Suicide* *Squad*'s newest trailer. Each day it's looking more and more like *Suicide* *Squad* will be the breadwinner of the DCCU in 2016."
CmRih_VtVAs,had to watch the trailer multiple times because (yet again) I kept being distracted by the shere awesomeness of boh rhap.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Will Smith smith?
Yes, Will Smith will smith"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I will watch only for actors
CmRih_VtVAs,"you know what? this just became my second most anticipated movie of 2016, after Deadpool."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, the first trailer made this seem like it would be really dark and grim... but after seeing this I now realise that this will be in fact incredibly light hearted and jokey. What a shame."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:37 Jai Courtney, you never fail me"
CmRih_VtVAs,"the reason I didn't skip this commercial was because the bohemian rhapsody was playing, glad I didn't skip, b/c it turned out to be a DC movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara isn't a good actress I feel like she might ruin the movie....
CmRih_VtVAs,"BOYCOTTING ANY WILL SMITH MOVIE, RACIST BASTARD, HIM AND HIS UGLY ASS CHILD LIKE WIFE ."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie might turn me into a DC fan
CmRih_VtVAs,Huh?
CmRih_VtVAs,What Happened To Joker . I mean Really why ?
CmRih_VtVAs,does Harleys necklace say puddin?
CmRih_VtVAs,Como se llama la canción de fondo :(?
CmRih_VtVAs,is it just me or Margot Robbie look cute as Harley ??
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bro, Harley Quinn. mmmmm."
CmRih_VtVAs,That epic song though!
CmRih_VtVAs,I vote one of the best trailers of all time
CmRih_VtVAs,where is Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,that moment 1:40 when music and action match perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol I love how Tom Hardy filled in for Jai Courtney on his days off.
CmRih_VtVAs,"They RAPED the song so bad in this trailer. Well, what the hell , I'll still watch it."
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck yes
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see joker's toys!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, doesn't involve Batman. Don't care about this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys !
CmRih_VtVAs,What even is this xd I love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm pretty sure i'm responsible for at least 1/4th of the views
CmRih_VtVAs,when you realise suicide squad has more views per trailer than batman v superman (supposedly biggest movie of 2016)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53 is cara Delaven
CmRih_VtVAs,ohh i can't wait until it's out!! so excited!
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who thinks we should get a deadshot movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Still not liking this Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,DIVA
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing. The combination of comedy and action is awesome. It is going to be so much better then batman and civil war.
CmRih_VtVAs,No man is a failure who is enjoying life with *(I G R O C K E T D O T C O M)* go get some extra ordinary fame on instagram
CmRih_VtVAs,I really want this to be good!!!....I just have a bad feeling.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker is what we all live for right?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto can show me his toys ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody, interesting music choice for a trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a Marvel fan, down to the core. But I'm not childish enough to say that this doesn't look like a good movie and I can't wait to see it. DC has a lot of catching up to do because their only good movie for the past 8 years was The Dark Knight, while Marvel has been killing it since 2008, but this looks like a good start."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuckkk I can't wait ANYMOREEEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto: *Leaves toilet seat up*
Suicide Squad Director: ""I'm peeing my pants, please stop"""
CmRih_VtVAs,IS THIS THE REAL LIFE
CmRih_VtVAs,Shit's wack.
CmRih_VtVAs,sign me up
CmRih_VtVAs,"Funny how Warner Bros. censored the ""bismillah"" (in the name of Allah/God) from the original song. Scared, much?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"am I the only one who feels like this is DC version of guardian's of the galaxy? a bunch of ""bad guys"" who come together to do something good?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is like the 50th time I watch this... No ragrets
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love this trailer so much, cant stop watching it, I WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE SO BADLY <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,Simply amazing Suicide Squad and Batman V Superman are really going to launch the DCEU into greatness.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warner I will get to watch this movie on my PC, or it will come with bug too?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait until movie
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, I just noticed that woman got laid out 0:40"
CmRih_VtVAs,there they are stupid villains saving the world
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,margot Robbie bending over gave me a hard on....
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a Harley girl in a Harley world. I'm sarcastic and fantastic. You can brush my hair but, I want pudding in everywhere. Celebration with Gotham's detonation. Come on Harley, let's go party!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm gonna watch this movie for sure
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no faith in this movie. I have little faith in BvS. Civil War is gonna shit on both of these turds.
CmRih_VtVAs,The DC animated movies are less cartoonish than this
CmRih_VtVAs,- Shouldn't Harley Quinn should have a fierce Brooklyn accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or does this look like they tried too hard on it. I really hope it's good and it isn't another botched film like man of steel or dark knight rises.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,what is she doing at 1:39
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly I just came here to hear Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,The 7000 dislikers must be thinking 'we're bad guys its what we do'
CmRih_VtVAs,R.i.P marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker's face :D 1:23
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:45 Le nom de musique ,  s'il vous plaît !? Merci"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks Joel Kinnaman kinda looks like Ashton Kutcher?
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is rock baby man I can wait to see this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,What on earth is going on at 2:03??
CmRih_VtVAs,"I..have..to..see..this...movie....
But I call that one of them ( probably the girl that hears voices or just overall crazy) will turn on them or something."
CmRih_VtVAs,Gay musik
CmRih_VtVAs,Such a well edited trailer. Love how everything fits the beat of the music. Easily the best trailer I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,they should make a second movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker isn't really the main antagonist, is he? He doesn't feel like it anyways."
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to listen to Queen now.
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith as a baddie is not right. but im sure he will play it well.
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMFG!! AM SOO HARLY QUINN!!!  AM CRAZY AND REBEL!!!!!! SHE IS JUST LIKE ME!!

#Crazy #UniqueAndDifferent #Comics  #Tumblr"
CmRih_VtVAs,"hasta agosto del 2016, y lo andan anunciando desde el año pasado.
jajaajaj Como les gusta hacer esperar a la gente"
CmRih_VtVAs,Seriously we could do with out cara delavigne  if that's how you spell it
CmRih_VtVAs,who the hell is Scott Eastwood playing?
CmRih_VtVAs,0:53 This movie is going to be awesome. Love Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,I still can't believe how great Jai Courtney is in this trailer.. JAI COURTNEY!
CmRih_VtVAs,What the hell is that thing on the subway scene?
CmRih_VtVAs,Kitana probaly won't be introduced to later in the movie because when they announce the team they never say her
CmRih_VtVAs,are they like the DC version of gardiens of the galaxy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why the hell is this called ""official trailer 1"" if it's the second trailer for the movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,but look at these guardians of the galaxy :v
CmRih_VtVAs,Stick with your shit 'I started a joke' Not something as great as queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I need to quit bitchin', first I bitched about Ben Affleck as batman and then I complained about Will Smith as deadshot. and the trailer for both movies is fantastic. Can't wait to see them both."
CmRih_VtVAs,Groovy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah I have to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck this looks like shit. can we stop making comic book movies for adult children already? no? oh they make a lot of money? oh ok. sorry i said anything. i should pay $15 & go see this because i like to waste my money on sewer culture. i especially like how you already know what you're getting & how it will end just by watching the trailer. very cool. also the use of queen here is very smart to rope in that mountain dew doritos demographic. thanks jewish hollywood.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this! 😀
CmRih_VtVAs,i thought my music player just started playing favourites as soon as i plugged in my earphones!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Could swear one of those guys look like tom hardy :L
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't care about BvS. This is the only DC movie I'm interested in. Thanks for an awesome trailer. You bastards just knew playing Bohemian Rhapsody would melt the coldest Marvel heart...
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SOOO FUCKING READY FOR THIS...
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer further complicates my weird attraction to Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,24 million wiew wooooowww her biji dc
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks absolutely insane...
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Качество хорошее фильма.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Неожидано, Харви Квин стала облёвананой наркоманкой, но в принципе это текущий тренд есть куда падать."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm officially hyped now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow so now the joker is a hero? Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,i really hope we get a movie about our Gothan Sirens.
CmRih_VtVAs,Waaa this looks great
CmRih_VtVAs,who the hell is that guy in the subway 1:43
CmRih_VtVAs,хрень какая то
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shit I'm defiantly gonna see this when it comes out DC you've outdone yourselfs
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here!!
CmRih_VtVAs,cannot wait for that movie like harley quinn looks great and enchantress and killer croc and deadshot and many more CANNOT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,paused at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,queen?? anybody?
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else notice that when the Joker and Harley Quinn were in the acid that the hair dye made a heart around them?
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome trailer!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The teaser was better. I preferred the darker tone.
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,who is the dude at 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,who exactly is the bad guy(s)?
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's face it captain boomerang is the real MVP here! I wonder who they're trying to stop? (1:44)
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevingne is Hot in this and will smith and Jared Leto is Great In This Movie in Their Rolls
CmRih_VtVAs,Would've liked it better if they casted Ann Hathaway instead of Margot Robbie for Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,I know this will be an unpopular opinion (at first I was skeptical about Leto's Joker too) but after seeing him at 1:59 with that purple outfit waving his finger I can say he looks DAMN GOOD.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2 questions: wtf Harlequin got in her hands, at the end of the chains, when she pretending shorting 1:39 ? 
and who's the villain at metro 1:45 ??"
CmRih_VtVAs,Only been out for four days and it already has more views than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,The music is the Soul of this Trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i just hope those jokes be all the jokes on the movie, I don't wanna a marvel movie...  always full of jokes.. I wanna dramatic action. I hope that I got right the vibe of this movie 
P.S.: Harlequin I love U 💙💖💗"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn is a nock off of Emily Autumn
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant waaaaiiiiiiiit :3
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody was the perfect song choice for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,This has more views than Batman v Superman trailer 🤔
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope this doesn't turn out to be a shitty movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks really good
CmRih_VtVAs,unbelievable! batman vs superman trailer 2 = 21 million views in a month. suicide squad trailer = 24 million views in 3 days!
CmRih_VtVAs,If Will Smith doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this movie he'll probably cry racism and boycott the Oscars like the little crybaby he is.
CmRih_VtVAs,at least they didn't spoil the shit like they did batmanVsuperman
CmRih_VtVAs,"When i first saw this joker i thought ""WHAT?! He looks terrible! He'll be the worst joker ever!"" 

When i now see this joker ""Wow he's awesome! He's gonna be amazing! He may even beat heath ledger!"" Maybe  ;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF is wrong with Harley's voice? Fucked up her outfit first and now that :'(
CmRih_VtVAs,1:08 Harley's wooo just made my day! :p
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasnt gonna watch this until i realize Will Smith was in it
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm kinda disappointed Margot is doing the classic Harley voice :/
CmRih_VtVAs,More views in 4 days than Batman v Superman in over a month.
CmRih_VtVAs,At first I thought it was Jai Courtney and I watched it again and it was him.
CmRih_VtVAs,leto's joker is giving me the same erection as ledger's one.....GLORY TO THE JOKER
CmRih_VtVAs,I have mixed feelings about this movie... but excited nonetheless.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the writer of this film?
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why am I here?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys- It's what we do."" ♡ CAN'T WAIT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,nice song.. !!  I love it bt it is not in movies ahhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will prove that David Ayer is a way better director than Zack Snyder.
CmRih_VtVAs,I did a review on this if anyone wants to check it out. and who else is ready for captain boomerang he seems like a fun time?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope this movie will be great just like we expect it to be
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath Ledger > Every actor in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This already has more views than the Batman vs Superman trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great choice of song. The trailer movie became more badass, I mean they really are badass but a great soundtrack adds more excitement to watch the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"stubbed my toe while watching this, pray for me"
CmRih_VtVAs,"What is 
the name of this song"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please don't suck, please don't suck, please don't suck!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Another disappointing movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,Have only watched the trailer 100 times
CmRih_VtVAs,Isn't Harley supposed to be scantily clad?
CmRih_VtVAs,so im guessing the two profiles rick flag didn't read (Slipknot and Katana's) are the ones who die in the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pra galera br Serio mesmo esse filme por causa de toda as polemicas etc... Vai entrar nas maiores bilheterias como vingadores,velozes e furiosos,e avatar... Esperem so"
CmRih_VtVAs,Life complete
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait for this like i always say this movie will be better than batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,1:18 i can watch this all day :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I am already in love with Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer alone is good. Bohemian Rhapsody is what makes it great.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i dont really get it why people are hating on marvel in the comment section i mean they are both releasing probably the two greatest movie this year 
them two being suicide squad and captain america civil war"
CmRih_VtVAs,illumiant
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait unitl my brithday it comes out yes!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,hate the new Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Jared leto's joker is better than Heath Ledger's joker.................I said it...I don't care
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am sure 99% of you wont continue to read this c(






If you have read this i wish you a nice weekend! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel's only answer to this should be a movie starring The Thunderbolts 

*(the ""Marvel NOW!"" version)*"
CmRih_VtVAs,When the ad is better than the video you're about watch...
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie makes no fucking sense, but imma still watch it"
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone spotted Cara Delevingne in the video ?
CmRih_VtVAs,chills!
CmRih_VtVAs,우와
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cara Delevigne, she is the love of my live. i love you💋😍😍😍😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,nice...
CmRih_VtVAs,Incoming understatement of the year- I'd like to see this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's strange that this is what WB decided to be their DC summer blockbuster. See if you tell me Batman V Superman is coming out this year I immediately think its coming out during the summer because just the title alone screams summer blockbuster. But WB decided to give BvS a march release and SS in August release. So that tells me WB has more faith in this movie than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how this trailer embraces the dark comical roots of the comics and can't wait for Civil War trailer 2 to drop (and not be serious becuz we know it won't be)
CmRih_VtVAs,One does not Simply watch this trailer without dancing to the music
CmRih_VtVAs,its so best for me
CmRih_VtVAs,i am way too excited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,10/10 villain squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see a lot of ""oh, it's 'x' fans disliking this"" or something. But it isn't that. Some aren't satisfied with the casting choices. 

Take Killer Croc, for instance. A very tall, muscular man would be a more convincing Killer Croc than who they have right now - ""The Mountain"" would've been a better choice. 

Then you got Jai Courtney. If you've ever seen the films he's been in, it just doesn't work - the last one is Terminator Genisys. How does he keep getting jobs? Did he buy Hollywood?

And Jared Leto. He's not a very convincing Joker. Well, the darker version, not the 60's version. Some people are going to bring up how Heath wasn't a favorite either until DK came out, so they should give Jared a chance too. I gave him a chance because he at least had the Joker look. But the problem with Jared as the Joker has more to do with his Joker look. Some think he just doesn't have the crazy laughter look (before he does something heinous), the mischievous grin (for when he's feeling ""naughty""), and the psychopathic stare (for when he's really angry). Some aren't keen on all the tattoos and the grill - that's not what the Joker is all about. Maybe they're trying to do a more ""edgy"" 60's version or something (hence with the grill and all the tats). I, for one, don't like whatever they're trying to do with the Joker character in this movie. I'd put Jared as one of the Suicide Squad, to replace Jai as Captain Boomerang, but not as the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel as if bohemian rhapsody adds a bit of psychotic shit to it
CmRih_VtVAs,cool. so 12a in the uk.
CmRih_VtVAs,que le den por culo al nuevo jocker  me quedo con el antiguo
CmRih_VtVAs,eso no puede ser el joker
CmRih_VtVAs,nunca me había emocionado tanto con un trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn???
CmRih_VtVAs,someone call batman!!!! 😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,so.... what's the plot?
CmRih_VtVAs,Im a marvel fanboy but this movie will be freakin awsome
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot is bae😍
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie's lines in this were sort of cringe worthy ugh.
CmRih_VtVAs,pochoclera? dónde?
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody. thats all i have to say.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks hella disappointing. And Will Smith is in it, so you already know how this will go. Reply to me after the movie releases."
CmRih_VtVAs,cara at 0:45?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker dipping Harley into her New 52 origin. Makes sense with the design they went with, but I will always be fond of Dini and Timm's Mad Love. Trailer looks great!"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's about to get crazy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury sent me here. ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell yeah Dc for the win!

CmRih_VtVAs,Im so excited. I smiled when I heard Bohemian Rhapsody and after the trailer idk if i can't stop smiling. August 5 can't come soon enough
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked the first teaser more than this one. The acting seemed hollow in this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did someone else saw the die antwoord drawings??
CmRih_VtVAs,Absolutley the best movie/music combo in history of trailers !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm here from the comments on Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,can someone explain how the 🃏 became 🃏 cuz I heard it was something to do with that pool he jumps in
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a simple girl. I hear Bohemian Rhapsody, I sing."
CmRih_VtVAs,I have watched this trailer about 20 times
CmRih_VtVAs,kids! this is what real music sounds like.
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking sick trailer watched it 1000000 times

CmRih_VtVAs,Getting a real Guardians vibe from this but more crazy and fun since this is bad guys doing good guys thing... While still being bad guys
CmRih_VtVAs,vite vite trop hâte de le voir ;-) il tue ce film

CmRih_VtVAs,hi
CmRih_VtVAs,this actually might be a good movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know now that I think about it , if they can do Suicide squad .They sure as hell can pull off a Teen Titans movie with death stroke as the main baddie. shit they could get Ron Perlman to be  slade that be sick asf"
CmRih_VtVAs,hi

CmRih_VtVAs,"23millones, sin comentario para mostrar!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,este trailer es ÉPICO  <3 alguien latino aquí? xd
CmRih_VtVAs,i just got a boner
CmRih_VtVAs,"that joker is a joke. sorry, i hate him"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg I can't get this grin off my face
CmRih_VtVAs,que pasa??
CmRih_VtVAs,Scott Eastwood as Nightwing?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley's joke lines are lame.  Boomerang sneaking a beer is funny, though."
CmRih_VtVAs,"that voices scene was kinda stupid but nonetheless it looks pretty good (aside from those joker tattoos, may never get over that)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I dont like the music with the trailer now I have my doubts about this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks good. but. DC Comics. DING.
CmRih_VtVAs,People I think the main antagonist is enchantress she is never with the team in both trailers and the weird voodoo thing which grabs things in the trailer fits to her powers
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN YASS
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no problems with Joel Kinnaman but it would have been awesome if Tom Hardy was still playing Rick flag
CmRih_VtVAs,i love harley so much
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever!! Can't wait till August! 😁
CmRih_VtVAs,oh hi deadshot let's just have a trillion guys beat you up
CmRih_VtVAs,August 5th? thats damn long
CmRih_VtVAs,0:26 OPEN D GATES BOYZ :DDDDDDDD trkGates
CmRih_VtVAs,"Welp...its gonna flop ..take my word for it. Imdb- 6.5-7 , rotton tomatoes 68%"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I only watched this trailer because it I heard bohemian rhapsody and it reminded me of outlast, so I didn't skip."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn's ass at 2:07

That is all"
CmRih_VtVAs,There just a load of geeks on here?
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this might actually be a successful movie
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name of the songs
CmRih_VtVAs,the voice from the soldier sounds like the voice of yasuo from league of legends
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best. Trailer. Ever.
Let's hope the movie's good as this."
CmRih_VtVAs,Go
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara delevigne 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah... Gonna go see this...
CmRih_VtVAs,My God! beautiful!! Just #SuicideSquad Bitch!
CmRih_VtVAs,what a fucking mess.  thing is embarassing. and fuck let to.  don't try and talk this movie up its new age trash and there ramming it down your throat expecting you to defend this movie. same with batman vs superman there shit cash grabs. so everyone defend it defend Hollywood's bullshit. gain fuck let to and the costume designer there fucking trash
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is orgasmic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes then
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect music for some weird reason.
CmRih_VtVAs,My penis is hard just from watching this.  :)
CmRih_VtVAs,That is a great deal of effort for a trailer...imagine how great the film will be!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The one problem with this movie is its coming out in 2016. I mean come on, I'm gonna be spending all my money on cinema tickets and DVDs at Christmas. Why must this year be full of good looking movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,Voices in the head joke is a pretty old one.
CmRih_VtVAs,"love this trailer, awesome !"
CmRih_VtVAs,i didnt want to watch this movie... until they used Queen against me
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so good fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,"The scene where Joker jumps into the Vat pool is so beautiful.. the music is making it seem a little more festive but... I'm sure the actual scene is very dark... brooding.... It looks like the place in which he was technically ""Created""... and the place where he created Harley.. such a pretty scene"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll probably be attacked for this... And I know it's not really fair to compare the two... But I'm a lot more excited for this than batman v superman. It just seems like a much more fun movie. I'm sure I'm going to enjoy all of the movies coming out though. It's going to be a good year lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that handbag suits harlequin
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this is a good movie.....cause it's deadshot's first appearance
CmRih_VtVAs,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmRih_VtVAs&t=1m59s best scene
CmRih_VtVAs,I can see that comic book guy contributed in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks weird with all his teeth silver
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love IT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why 2016. The movies im gonna spend on. Just. Mercy me. I gotta save up for summer sale too.
CmRih_VtVAs,лойс!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Please don't kill off Croc!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Good to see a couple of Aussies representing us in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,is this movies pg-13?
CmRih_VtVAs,Uh-Oh Heroines in  in skimpy clothes! Well just wait till I tell Anita Sarkisian about this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,it took 3 days for the views on this to surpass the views on the last BVS trailer that's been out for a month or so. 👏👏👏 that bodes well for DC and Warner bros!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Peli-Culon xD
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is perfection.
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the f***ing age rating
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks like it will be so bad it might be good. Maybe sadistic humor from the characters will be funny. This joker looks like a crossover of Lil' Wayne and Jack Nicholson's joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,"why are there still Leto haters man? No doubt, Heath was incredible as the Joker but let me break it y'all, that wasn't the joker from the comics. The whole Darknight trilogy wasn't like the comics. I love new fresh things but come on Leto's performance, I think, will be as good as Heath, Jack and even Mark's. Wait and see."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 nice t-shirt on background
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the guy with the fire ability. Don't know who he is but he stands out to me in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"For your information, Leto is one damn good actor and singer. I think there's endless possibility he would beat Heath's Joker in this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,"First time watching this trailer......my reaction 

.........THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! Yessss yes yes!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best part is batman put them all away
CmRih_VtVAs,DC bad guys will beat Marvels good guys in blockbuster.... my prediction.
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that Sheamus?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hit me up on snapchat; ivar4tb
CmRih_VtVAs,I literally come back to see this everyday o.O
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn works great here. 
But the Joker just can't be taken seriously. And no, that's not a compliment."
CmRih_VtVAs,reminds me of watchmen
CmRih_VtVAs,im in tears...this....this is pure art.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have watched this abot 1000 times today. SO EXCITED:)
CmRih_VtVAs,Что это за х..ня?
CmRih_VtVAs,Good news for will smith. This movie will definitely win an award so he can stop whining like a big fat pussy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow They became an Anti-Hero
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the real life? or is this just fanta sea?
CmRih_VtVAs,cara delevingne😈😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,now i want to see Fredie Mercury play the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,now i want to see Fredie Mercury play the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,watching for harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,whats Batman's role in suicide squad thoooo??
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx in real Life :3
CmRih_VtVAs,Fred would be proud :D definitely the best trailer of this year!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who's the crazy chick? I don't follow Marvel or DC, so I'm unsure. Looks good though"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks cool i wanna watch it !
CmRih_VtVAs,looks cool i wanna watch it !
CmRih_VtVAs,Guys just  a question.... who is the powerful comic book  character other than One Above All  ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Spoiler Alert: 0:09 Harley has her pink and blue hair in her cell where every other cell scene she's only blonde. This means towards the end of the movie, she makes it out alive (no surprise) and is put back in her cell by barbara. This scene is probably the last scene of the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,This and Deadpool are the only movies I am excited about. Batman v. Superman: meh. Civil war: meh.
CmRih_VtVAs,why not 2017????
CmRih_VtVAs,😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Personally, I think this movie is going to blow donkey wang. Here's to hoping my low expectations allow me to really enjoy suicide squad!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate smith > <
CmRih_VtVAs,Who watched the trailer a million time :D
CmRih_VtVAs,what's that song name after opening that soda can?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:10 just made my day...
CmRih_VtVAs,EMMA WATSON😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome as fuck. Harley Quinn is so gorgeous.
CmRih_VtVAs,what's that song? i never heard it
CmRih_VtVAs,Way more excited for this than superman vs batman
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope the movie is good as this trailer. I really hope.
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto better than Ledger Yes I said it.

CmRih_VtVAs,WTF that Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"nice strategy by DC. They can't compete against The Avengers and show their own group of heroes in the movies. So, they just decided to go with the villan group. Well played."
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is getting better everyday. xD
CmRih_VtVAs,can't stand that cara deviligne
CmRih_VtVAs,Does killercroc have a shotgun
CmRih_VtVAs,i see jinx
CmRih_VtVAs,the only downside of this trailer is that batman wasnt there
CmRih_VtVAs,"we all know we're just here for Harley Quinn. Stop denying.

♩ ♪ Why are you lying? Why the fuck are you lying. You lie so bad ♩ ♪ ♬"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the most beautiful thing i've seen in my entire life.
CmRih_VtVAs,"nice ""MLG"""
CmRih_VtVAs,i am so ready and excited harley is amazing yesyesyesyesy
CmRih_VtVAs,"There's a manic energy to this trailer that I've never seen in a superhero movie trailer. Even Deadpool's trailers,(as excited for that movie as I am) don't get me as pumped as this does."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im boycotting this movie, too many white people



Just kidding"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was wack it sucked bad.. First trailer was awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Gotta edit in more Will Smith in the trailer lest black people boycott this film even though evidently the white actors' performances shine brighter in this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,"that harley quinn need her own movie where she is the main villian , she is just interesting"
CmRih_VtVAs,Rated : E for Edgy kids
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like Margot Robbie is going to steal the show
CmRih_VtVAs,i love you Harley Gueen 😘😘😚😚😘
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 Holder :D
CmRih_VtVAs,nice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel is killing Civil War.
DC is going to take over."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks WAY better then Batman v Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if they have a better reason than because fire rises.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like this Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Let's do something fun"" 
Enchantress please fuck me up"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nothing really matters.... TO meeeeeee... Except if the Joker does a great job in the film, that matters ALOT to me."
CmRih_VtVAs,waaaay more excited for this and deadpool than batman v superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,that dialogue... so cringeworthy. more overblown hollywood garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,"Epic traiker, everything is amazing.. nothing wrong.

Now.. this or the first trailer? hmm"
CmRih_VtVAs,"guys .this is awesome ... action,comedy  movie ! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,making nerds wet
CmRih_VtVAs,Most boring movie ever in 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,I think suicide squad is gonna be awesome cause of this trailer and the other comic con one and also 1:53 joker face like did he fart or something and look at 1:59 this supports the new 52 theory that joker tortured dr Harleen quinzel and threw her in a pit of acid so they will be the same cuz in his insane mind he thinks that if he does that she will love him more and they will be happier
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my togs ivi
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just love how ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" fits so perfectly with the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought Harley Quinn would be a little more sexy kind bummed about that
CmRih_VtVAs,nice one Warner bros
CmRih_VtVAs,SO EXCITED!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"No.
Just no.
Yeah it looks like a fun movie but they completely fucked Harley up.
If looking the part was sooooo damn difficult why didn't they just leave her voice the way it's usually supposed to be? 
I'm extremely disappointed with seeing my favourite character completely butchered!"
CmRih_VtVAs,marvel fans disliked
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST 5th 2016?! That far way?!! WHYYYYYY
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't believe someone blew the secret of this movie for me. This movie has the most amazing twist and I won't blow it but it's literally the best twist ever in a movie. I only wish I didn't already know it and could watch the movie and freak out when they finally reveal the secret.
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK SHIT IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,There is 7K dislikes and 7 JLA heroes
CmRih_VtVAs,"A bit sceptical at first, but I really like the style a lot. Joker and Harley are really vibrant in this dark DC universe."
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie is so beautifu as harley quinn.. cara is 2nd only as enchantress. love them both anyway!
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst Heroes Ever Hahahahahhaahah
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto is joker haha..
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought this would've been more dark and twisted than comedic
CmRih_VtVAs,more ofJared Letto's Joker vids please. this guys just might have pulled off the joker role.
CmRih_VtVAs,i didn't know where to focus on: the song or the trailer XD
CmRih_VtVAs,0.08 turkish coffee
CmRih_VtVAs,deadshot looks badass af
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:10
Am I the only one who recognizes that Harley Quinn is wearing slippers? XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who is pissed becuse deadshots eye is on the wrong one...its on left when it should be on the right eye...
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, that's what we do.""

Yep, I already don't like it. I don't see the appeal in meta humor and quite frankly, I find it obnoxious. Harley Quinn seemed like she was trying too hard, I don't know if that's her character but that's the vibe I was getting. Liked the inclusion of Bohemian Rhapsody though."
CmRih_VtVAs,soooooo.......gonna......... get ripped bcuz of this upcoming 2016 movies.
CmRih_VtVAs,it would be AWESOME if Harley QUINN reads miranda sings book
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love Ledgers Joker, but I also think Leto is going to do a different, yet awesome take on 60's Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto looks like he's going to do a modern version of 60's Joker. He seems like he's going to pull it off.
CmRih_VtVAs,song name plz :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,LOOOOOLS WAS EXPECTING THATSU FROM ARROW BASED ON WHAT I SAW ON THE THUMBNAIL LOOOOOLLLLLLLLLL
CmRih_VtVAs,ihuojuojioijo
CmRih_VtVAs,The arrow suicide squad is better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel is was like that friend that you got excited when he made it and your like ''ni**a we made it'' till he starts telling how how great he is and much better than everyone, then you just want a moving bus to get hit by him...... bottom line happy dc is focused now"
CmRih_VtVAs,great
CmRih_VtVAs,QUE ESE CULO ESTE EN LA PELICULA PORQUE SINO QUEMO WARNER BROS! LO JURO!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like the first trailer established the serious nature of suicide squad, while this trailer shows the chaos and psychotic minds of these ""heroes"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Whosoever desires constant success JUST  try *(I G R O C K E T D O T C O M)*   and enjoy your success
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh , sh*t."
CmRih_VtVAs,"So I'm guessing the plot is: Government has a problem, probably illegal, black bag stuff...can't get the real heroes involved due to questions, why? what? Who? Let's get these handful of villains--they assemble but are leashed (explosive planted somewhere. Goes sideways because everyone wants to go their separate ways, Joker keeps getting in the way...and the plot thickens."
CmRih_VtVAs,Thanks Bohemian Rhapsody for introducing me to this awesome trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,If after this Will Smith won't get an Oscar I'm moving to another planet
CmRih_VtVAs,im excited to watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks fucking stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,"I must confess: I was really sceptical about this before. But now I'm intrigued. Dark humor, bad guys, bizzare action...what's not to like??"
CmRih_VtVAs,Песня тронула.....ааааа(((
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks mega interesting, compared to everything that's came before it, with the exception of GotG; but please calm down with the ""RIP Marvel"" nonsense. That's just a very silly statement to make."
CmRih_VtVAs,date???
CmRih_VtVAs,Mamamia...........Let Me Go!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm literally fangirling so much rn. I used to not really care for DC but my bestie told me that I was missing out on basically pure awesome-ness. she was right. I love DC and I can't wait for the movie to come out!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 whos that?
CmRih_VtVAs,meh.....
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck yes. ❤

CmRih_VtVAs,cara delvinge??
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone who still thinks Jared Leto is gonna be a bad joker? Because after this you definitely should not! This is easily the best and most comic accurate depiction of the Joker i have seen in any movie. Heath Ledger was awesome, but I honestly think Jared Leto is going to top him with this."
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool has more ass than harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"STUPID comments, got..
STUPID replies, and got many...
STUPID likes, so i made a...

CmRih_VtVAs,Annalise Keating LOL
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was thinking, maybe when he leaps into the green chemicals, it burns off his tattoos. That was my theory. But either way if that aint true of a theory.. I'm still cool with that tattoos he has. I don't really care if he keeps or loses them."
CmRih_VtVAs,massive props to the people (or person) who edited this trailer with the music because I jizzed all 17 times I watched it
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice vid
CmRih_VtVAs,"i hate the trailer,
but i guess this will be an awesome movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"greatest song of all time with expected shit movie with shity idea.....

CmRih_VtVAs,"fuck the entire cast. who the fuck does DC think they are? lucas arts? your hype is killing this movie, and your hype sucks."
CmRih_VtVAs,wow! what a hot harley quinn!. 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Badass trailer im so hype for this movie yess 😄
CmRih_VtVAs,This isn't real Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can it be...Jai Courtney is being expressive? If he's good I have a feeling Captain Boomergang could be my favorite in SS.
CmRih_VtVAs,I just can't wrap my mind around a group of supposedly the biggest villains that are now being portrayed as heroes to kill other bad guys.
CmRih_VtVAs,yo will smith. YOU ARE NOT GETTING AN OSCAR FOR THIS!
CmRih_VtVAs,Whos watching this 2016?
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk about ya'll but I think Jared Leto is going to be a Great Joker !! This new incarnation of him suits the movie so far.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""sorry the voices. I'm kidding that's not what they really said."" lmao!! Margot robbie totally killed as harley quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman V Superman > Shit Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,will Smith in the role of will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,Отвратительный саундтрек....
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shizzle! i'm bloody excited to see this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,wait so the squad is not the bad guys in this movie ? they're the hero or what ?
CmRih_VtVAs,can't be good. Too many cool characters in one movie.  It's too cool. Unless the movie is more than 4 hours for which the characters individually get more screentime.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 why you all are here for.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else saw in that club were Harley shot people she had the same curly hair as in the car with joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"they really put this trailer together well,all the sound effects and coordination with the music was great."
CmRih_VtVAs,"It really does look like it's trying very hard to be edgy... but tbh looks fun,  ill probably watch it"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope this movie is as good as it looks.
CmRih_VtVAs,DC SUCKS BUT THIS MOVIE MIGHT BE THE ONLY GOOD MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,this movies gonna flop .
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not a Marvel or DC fanboy just want to start a conversation: this movie or deadpool?
CmRih_VtVAs,The best trailer for the last year. Can't stop watching
CmRih_VtVAs,Is everybody ingnoring the fact that slip knot is NOWHERE in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,The people who disliked this are probably over 12 years old and fed up with the same old Hollywood garbage that's been getting churned out for a long while now.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I never heard of these guys but i'm gonna be honest, i'm only gonna watch this movie for the crazy witch lady. She's already gonna be my favourite character. Also I like the idea of bad guys being good guys.. but i don't know if it'll work. But it might..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC : Marvel, I can't wait to show you my toys"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this trailer game?
CmRih_VtVAs,Way too long
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks soo good!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Too much pandering for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody!
CmRih_VtVAs,Only for Will Smith ❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,This version of Joker is sick!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel get your boxing gloves on, cos you're in for some stiff fucking competition!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, I am so upset about Harley. Dr. Harleen Quinzel DOES NOT have schizophrenia or any other mental illness that would cause her to hear voices. She has stockholm syndrome from living in an abusive realtionship with the joker and WILLINGLY TAKES ON THE PERSONA OF HARLEY QUINN TO PLEASE HIM. That shit right there is just pure ""LOL I'm so crazy and egdy x3"". It's like taking a character in a wheelchair and making him blind cause ""He's disabled, right? It's all the fucking same""
Harley was always been a deep, tragic and lovable character and this movie just fucks that right in the ass."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This just looks like a goddamn great time at the movies.  It's got an energy and personality that Man of Steel sorely lacked, and BvS seems to lack it as well.  This is precisely what I wanted to see from DC; a sense of unapologetic joy.

BvS's marketing feels like the movie is explaining to you why it's cool, despite the fact that telling someone you're cool doesn't make you cool.  And then here comes Suicide Squad crashing through a brick wall on fire, double fisting beers and screaming ""LET'S GET MESSED UUUUUUP!""

I don't know about you guys, but I wanna hang out with Suicide Squad out of the two of them.  I mean, look at it!  IT'S GOT A PANDA WITH A MACHINE GUN!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one to watch this three times in the theater once it releases?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys"". I just can't stop myself from laughing everytime I watch this part."
CmRih_VtVAs,harley is acting more sassy and funny here than normal and i loike
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone here actually READ Suicide Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,This film will bomb. It's very simple: look up the director and check aggregated review scores for his/her films. This will be bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,i really like this...
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith's wide variety of movie roles impesses me
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song in this trailer???:)
CmRih_VtVAs,cool but more batman!
CmRih_VtVAs,"HOLY SHIT 
Cupguntom inspired DC to make a movie named suicide squad I'm done :v"
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker is literally crazy for not liking Harley. She's so beautiful and her personality is cute. 😄😍😘
CmRih_VtVAs,3 days and it already has gotten the same amount of views than the Batman V Superman trailer 2 in 2 months (on this channels)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is Harley Pale as fuck though? I know Joker has always been pale depending on the origin story. But Harley? Is that make-up? In the first trailer though, she was in a cell and her whole body was pale as fuck. What is the reason for that? Am I overthinking this simple detail?"
CmRih_VtVAs,itis  let me think about jinx.....
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh boy!
CmRih_VtVAs,"it reminds me, somehow, on the band seven from anime 'inuyasha'"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who will watch it in 0.5 speed to observe the details
CmRih_VtVAs,Subscribe me and I'll Subscribe you back thanks
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like this movie is trying to compete with marvel's Deadpool movie coming out,.....but honestly.... don't crucify me for saying this but I also feel like this film is gonna be _better_ then the deadpool movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,как
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome 🎼👍
CmRih_VtVAs,Bonus Scott Eastwood is in it
CmRih_VtVAs,1:28 ❤❤❤
CmRih_VtVAs,Yessssssss
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow the comment section really knows how to kill everything , just gave myself a headache ."
CmRih_VtVAs,Seems more like a guardians of the galaxy diss.. Which is good
CmRih_VtVAs,DC try harding MARVEL. This ain't gonna be good
CmRih_VtVAs,What Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto sucks...Mark Hamill is the Joker. The only joker...this guy sucks.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just here to see it for like . . . hundreds time since yesterday. 
LMAO for the soundtrack, my favorite all the time."
CmRih_VtVAs,Now i wanna play the bad guys. SO FUCKING AWESOME!! I MIGHT KILL SOME PEOPLE. nah ill just take the easy and stable life.
CmRih_VtVAs,i am more looking forward to batman bad blood than this piece of shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,that was just bad!this looks fucking stupid.i feel sorry for dc fans.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just from this trailer, I think this is going to be DC's equivalent to Guardians of the Galaxy."
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is easily going to be the best movie trailer of 2016. The song is absolutely PERFECT for it, and it evolves as it goes on (prison, then not letting them go, etc.), Freddie Mercury was a god among men before the accident. The trailer is funny and awesome, I just don't see anything topping it."
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do I have this feeling that these bad guys movie would be as big (or bigger) than The Avengers movies? 😊😊😊
CmRih_VtVAs,As excited as I am for this movie and for the 52 origin of Harley to be on screen I would think this would be better if it was rated R. That way Harley and Mr. J's abusive relationship can be truly shown.
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC: Give us a chance with this movie, please....    THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE THE BEST EVER!! TRUST ME!!
Marvel: I wanna make a movie about a sassy guy in a red suit.
DC: They're bad films.
Marvel: Films will be films
DC: Watch all the films!
Marvel: What's this, a Batman film?
DC: Hi critics.
Marvel: James Bond: Guy who punches people,
DC: He's a guy in a tux and has loads of girlfriends,
Marvel: Shoots people,
DC: Is a orphan,
Warner Bros: Well you too are just action.
Marvel: What was that, too make loads of movies that are bad. Sorry, the critics. Haha! I'm kidding, that's not what they really want.
DC: This is the thing, you're making movies that are very bad.
Marvel: People who say that get killed.
Warner Bros: Lets make a good film.
Marvel: I can't WAIT to show you Deadpool!
Critic: Lets watch something good.
DC: Haha.. NOOOOOOOO
Critic: Do it!
Marvel: Seriously? What's wrong with you people.
Critic: We're critics, it's what we do."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it wrong for me to think that Harley is hot
CmRih_VtVAs,Man the music made it funny. I liked the darker trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not into superheroes, but this movie looks sooo good! Hype!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that they played bohemian rhapsody for the trailer makes me want to see the movie 5000 times more
CmRih_VtVAs,Gives me too much of a Guardians of the Galaxy type of vibe...I don't care tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,who are the dc characters in this movie I only know harely quinn(which hot!!! ) and I think that was killer crock or am I wrong
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the girl with the Katana?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warner Bros, you know how to match movie clips to ""Bohemian Rhapsody""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst Heroes Ever is KICK-ASS!! LOL
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"came here for Queen.
and found it quite interesting lol,finally not some justice-and-honor shit for superhero movie yeah:)))))"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's what we do ;P
CmRih_VtVAs,so is the joker the enimie here?
CmRih_VtVAs,You know the plot seems a bit similar to Guardians of the Galaxy... Hey just saying
CmRih_VtVAs,The first trailer was much darker
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad backwards is daub edicius which is latin for ""fuck you Marvel"""
CmRih_VtVAs,I fucking love Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,Внезапный кементарий на русском
CmRih_VtVAs,the new avengers looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ugh , 00:40 

Can Hollywood please make a movie that doesn't promote violence against women for once? Guess the patriachy win again


Ladies on behalf of my gender , I apologise"
CmRih_VtVAs,Brainiac is in the subway !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 00:45 isn't that Enchantress? she must ve been on the good side
CmRih_VtVAs,"So awesome, amazing time to be a nerd at the moment DC, Marvel and Star Wars!"
CmRih_VtVAs,the blond girl like jinx in lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"THE JOKER THOUGH AAAAAAAAAH!!!!! I thought I'd never grow out of Heath Ledger, but I think I'm ready to move on."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who has made this trailer? It's phenomenal. Love it <3 Do you agree?
CmRih_VtVAs,rip mcu

CmRih_VtVAs,THE FUCKING HYPE IS REAL!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,@2:07 DAMN girl!!
CmRih_VtVAs,All songs names please?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,The song truly captures the craziness. Can't wait for the movie. Great work by whoever choose Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:16 yassss Harley pull out that gun bitch!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I like this trailer a lot! But PLEASE dial back the sudden one liners. It's like I'm in the back seat of a smooth car ride and then STOP... and then I'm back and then STOP... and then STOP... and STOP!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody I approve
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit, this is gonna be DC's Guardians of the Galaxy :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody. Pure awesome :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Let's do something fun."" Yes, let us away to blow up whatever, sounds like a blast.

hahaha"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is joker good or bad that's what I'm wondering!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so... so.... fucking awesome man.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot looked a lot like Gillian Jacobs (Britta from Community) in this trailer !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,looks sick
CmRih_VtVAs,https://shorte.st/ref/238b1e2831
CmRih_VtVAs,"anyone else notice how the joker only appears with harley and not the team, and when he appeared he had his own guards behind him. anyone ever thought that maybe the joker is going to be the villain of the movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,george bush did 9/11 and that zionwood movie is crap
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's Will Smith's bad guy? Muhammad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Once this movie comes out and muslims watch it.... they will no longer have any issues with the western world.
Everything is going to get better you guys because western art is just too good to deny!"
CmRih_VtVAs,La wea wena weon conchetumareee
CmRih_VtVAs,I absolutely love Harley Quinn in this movie!! 😍😍😍 
CmRih_VtVAs,YeeeeeeE that's gonna be amazing...  Marvel can kiss my ass!
CmRih_VtVAs,"this guy just pulls out a beer lol, hes like oh shit haha! 1:35"
CmRih_VtVAs,"We have to wait till August for this, but Batman vs Superman comes out March WTF??!?!?!?

Switch dates"
CmRih_VtVAs,"gotta love haters, guarantee when the film comes out everyone here shitting on it will enjoy the fuck out of the movie, whether they admit it or not, cause that is the very nature of a hater"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want so badly to be hyped for this movie. But I'm still hung up on the Joker,  I still thinks he looks like some kind of drugged-out Juggalo."
CmRih_VtVAs,Animation version was better ;P  only Will S. is good here ;P
CmRih_VtVAs,the music makes this look stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the few movies I'm excited too see. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors besides Will Smith so I can't wait to see how well they will do.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Maybe it's just me but I was expecting something different from Harley Quinn. It seems she is being portrayed as psychotic and comedic and I was expecting more of an Arkham Asylum, more ruthless Harley with her being equally psychotic just less comedic"
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to know the song.. they use
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of that song :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know i like suicide squad... i just dont get it?
1. Why america needs a bad guys to defeat a terrorist? while america have a great army and weapons
2. Why DC put suicide squad first before the new batman movies come i mean.... these guys are the enemy of batman right? then i'm pretty sure that they gonna show up againt in batman movie.... it just not make sense
3. Who's the villains? joker?
4. Where's Batman? even batman alone can finish this work without suicide squad
5. Where's superman? 
6. Why in TV show gotham there was suicide squad with different actors?
7. Why they free all the bad guys i mean i know is for a good thing BUT im pretty sure after this movie they will make somthing craazy and evil againt in Gotham and problem will never end
etc

Advice from me DC
1. Just calm be patient take your breath, i know you want to kick marvel's ass but just calm down, 
2. Dont make anything soo fast without think i mean they show suicide squad trailer soo fast before the movie comes out 
3. It doesnt mean you making something new is great, i mean look at legends of tomorrow's bad
4. Dont make the important characters like flash in the TV show, i know in the movies they will change a different actors i mean it just bothering me
etc


(Sorry BAD ENGLISH)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This film seems like an early Oscar contender for next year. Hell, a good number of superhero films that came before deserved an Oscar nod."

CmRih_VtVAs,"""and the trying to seem like Guardians Of The Galaxy award goes to..................Oh, it's a tie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,Judging from the trailer im happy to see that this Joker is different than Christopher Nolan's movies (not that Heath Ledgers joker was bad at all). Wish i could say for Ben Aflecks Batman...
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG 
this is perfect"
CmRih_VtVAs,So good👍
CmRih_VtVAs,All I want to see is captain boomerang

CmRih_VtVAs,Sign me up ☝
CmRih_VtVAs,"Maybe I'm missing something, but are Joker and Harley not supposed to be funny at all?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"If anyone wants to see Harley Quinn naked watch ""Wolf Of Wall Street"" 2013. your welcome you wankers."
CmRih_VtVAs,did I just saw Mr. Freeze?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else watched this multiple times and has the song stuck in there head? August come faster please!

CmRih_VtVAs,Could you Imagine if they did a Harley Quinn Joker trailer of the suicide Squad and Perfect Day by Lou Reed was playing
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so much better than the first look
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks like about what I expected: over-produced, pretentious crap"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I
Can't
Fucking
Wait
Damnit!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry Jared,but you can't even beat Margot. So i don't need to mention what Heath did"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC or MARVEL just as long as these movies are well scripted and Directed. Thats all that matters. Its great to watch movies that takes your mind on a journey of awesomeness. A break from reality.
CmRih_VtVAs,song
CmRih_VtVAs,The Batman disliked this
CmRih_VtVAs,If I wasn't convinced I sure am now this is one movie I won't be seeing.

CmRih_VtVAs,im so excited in that movie  from    villain  to hero  it was awesome movie        3  im inlove in harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,If you think about it the song could be a reference to what happen to jason todd!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,i feel like joker turns into that monster thingy
CmRih_VtVAs,DC's answer to Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 what do you think happen ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh cool, they put the origin of how harley quin was created in it~~~~ they will probably put mr j's face  torn off at some point in the series, won't they? UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS EVEN IF IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THE COMICS!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, that clinches it. I'm gonna see this movie."

CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie must be a masterpiece. love how the joker smiles and laughs. must be a great movie, maybe better than civil war"
CmRih_VtVAs,No thank you
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, I approve now."
CmRih_VtVAs,In 3 days this trailer has passed Batman V Superman's second trailer... This is an awesome trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know they won't do it, but it would be fucking awesome if, instead of generic action movie music, all of the action sequences played out with classic rock like in this trailer. That would be Fury Road-tier awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dont like the fact that they made this movie pg-13. Like mfer this is the suicide squad, but fuck it lets see if they can pull off this pg bullshit"
CmRih_VtVAs,Just watched that whole movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks lame.
CmRih_VtVAs,waw nice films i like it. visit to my channels guys i hope you like my videos and please for click Subscribe Thanks :)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 he looks like a robot
CmRih_VtVAs,"1. Love the song
2. Where can I preorder my ticket cause I AM SEEING THIS MOVIE
3. Jared Leto is oddly attractive as the joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:50 you're possesed by a witch
CmRih_VtVAs,"I get why they're releasing this for a PG-13 audience, but here's to hoping for a rated R director's cut to follow"
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is gonna rock for comic book flicks!!... And finding dory too
CmRih_VtVAs,Still got no idea what the plots about
CmRih_VtVAs,"Are you kidding me! this is getting ridiculous. Why is this crap getting so much hype? We don't know where it sits in the timeline, we do know it uses some of Batman's iconic rogues gallery and if no one dies then it won't live up to Suicide Squad! If someone does, well that's a character that will never make it to screen again going against there actual foe and then we have the fact that the characterizations seem to be lacking. Not saying I won't see it but I'll probably miss it in the cinema.

Seriously WB and DC, you guys have the most well known over the top OP characters in comic book history, better known to the world than any of the characters that Marvel are using and this is the best you can do! Let me known when you grow up and start doing something that actually looks enjoyable! I mean you have Harley Quinn and Joker, They should bring a whole ton of wacky and unexpected and so far Joker comes off as your garden variety goon and Harley had ""voices"" broke a window for a purse.

Well your nothing if not unoriginal! Seriously Marvel can get away with unoriginal, look at their characters, most are rip off's from your own characters, but from you I expect much more!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hi there,  Expressive! error farm % !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is that at 1:44? In the subway train?
CmRih_VtVAs,"One of the best trailer I've ever seen! 
I'm excited ^ ^"
CmRih_VtVAs,This will be a great Movie ☆☆☆☆☆☆
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else recognised the riddler reference
CmRih_VtVAs,I like DC more than Marvel because it has more memorable movies...the only marvel movie I remember is avengers
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:00 Imagine if he is doing this to batman. OMG I am so hyped, My hype train is gonna blow!"
CmRih_VtVAs,*heavy breathing*
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,what if helena bonhamm Carter was Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,They're advertising in Jan for an Aug release date?? Is that normal?
CmRih_VtVAs,wait who tf is the all-powerful evil guy destroying the subway?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks pretty awesome I will definitely see it!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wooooooooooooooooooooo
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how Batman & Superman respond to this...???
CmRih_VtVAs,That was hilarious 😂👌🏼😜
CmRih_VtVAs,That's a great Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thumbs up if you think that Harley Quinn and Joker are going to steal this flick. And if she is as good in the flick as she seems to be in this teaser, Margot will be the woman everyone will be talking about. (""We're bad guys, it's what we do...""). Love that line."
CmRih_VtVAs,crazy comic
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie comes out on my birthday, this will be a great movie to watch"
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks as if it's going to be a little corny. They should have gave it an R rating and let Tarantino direct it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs up to the guys that made this trailer!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,did that dude really fucking crack open like a fucking redbull
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is completely opposite from the comic con trailer. That trailer showed the movie in a very dark tone. It almost seemed like an epic with Watchmen style treatment. This trailer shows the movie in a very light manner. It has an animated tone to it, and seems to have a lot of humor, almost like Marvel treatment. 

Man I was really excited by the comic con trailer, but I am not too excited by this."
CmRih_VtVAs,YES! FINALLY A COMIC TURNED MOVIE DONE RIGHT!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best movie of 2016 , I called it"
CmRih_VtVAs,#1
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, no. Four seconds in, and I'm disgusted. You do not get to use _Bohemian Rhapsody_ as your teaser song. I don't give two shits how good you _think_ your movie is going to be—and you appear to have a lot more hope for this movie than the majority of the population still exercising common sense—you do not get that luxury.

Secondly, what source material are you pulling from? I want to say it's the New 52 line-up... but then where's Black Manta or Parasite? And it's sure not the 1987-92 line-up, because then where are Nightshade and the Bronze Tiger? Who the fuck invited Killer Croc, Katana, El Diablo and Slipknot... no, better question: why do Killer Croc and Enchantress perpetually look like they just crawled out of a sewer? You already have a fully fleshed-out roster from _Arrow,_ so why aren't you doing the Marvel thing where the television shows and cinematic universe tie in to one another? What the hell are you people thinking?!

Third... who did the casting? No, I mean this. Do you _really_ think anyone is going to take Jared Leto seriously as the 'Clown Prince of Crime'? He looks like some coked-out self-abuser with a terrible case of meth mouth, and all of those goofy-looking tattoos look terrible. And you know what—let's extend this to the rest of the cast.
• Why does Margot Robbie look like she ran through a Hot Topic naked and blindfolded and put on whatever she pulled off the nearest clothing racks? Why are you having her scream phrases that were tired and annoying in the MySpace era? Is she gonna start saying random shit like _""rawr means 'I love you' in dinosaur""_ or occasionally scream _""LOL xD WAFFLES!""_ in every other scene?
• Is it any wonder that Will Smith doesn't look like he wants to be there? Does he need to pay off a new flat-screen TV or something? For that matter, _why Will Smith as Deadshot?_ You could've easily cast Joel Kinnaman as Deadshot, cast Will Smith as Black Spider or Bronze Tiger, and had two characters that more accurately resemble their comic book counterparts without really majorly changing any part of the script.
• Who honestly gives a fuck about half of the other characters—Rick Flag? Slipknot? Katana? El Diablo? I'm still trying to get over the fact that Enchantress and Killer Croc look like decomposing turds wrapped in burlap sacks, but it's impossible... literally impossible!

I think the only character you _might've_ actually gotten right was Captain Boomerang, but saying that is still a massive stretch six months before the movie's eventual release... otherwise, the casting seems entirely wrong; the script just sounds awful; the woman playing Amanda Waller just sounds entirely unconvincing.

*People, do yourselves a huge favor: save yourselves six months of over-hyped anticipation and proportional eventual disappointment, and go watch **_Batman: Assault on Arkham_** online. You'll be saving yourselves a lot of trouble in the long run.*"
CmRih_VtVAs,terrible choice for the song...ugh
CmRih_VtVAs,Of course I went immediately to the bohemian rhapsody song after viewing this...Mama Mia Mama Mia!!!!

If you haven't read a comic or seen an animated suicide squad movie you should not be commenting on this. You have not seen the movie so before commenting turn off your computer and wait until August like everybody else. Then you could whine about it. But right now it is useless and makes you seem ignorant. I have my doubts about the movie but you don't see me whining when we've only seen 3 mins of the movie. Also the dc vs marvel war is bullshit stfu and enjoy both."

CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,Who was the dude with the soda?
CmRih_VtVAs,I was gonna say a Suicide Squad joker .....but you wouldn't Harley get it
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know about you guys but I thought the Harley Quinn lines were very Harley-esque. For example the voices in the head joke was brilliant in many ways. It could either be seen as a joke for herself (since no one else was laughing) which makes her seem more psychotic for laughing at her own jokes, plus she does this joke many times in the comic which shows how the script stays true to its original material. Or since Harley used to be a psychiatrist and still retains her smartness even after going crazy, the joke could have been seen as a way to make herself look silly so the guards around will underestimate her which is a ingenious tactic to plan an escape."
CmRih_VtVAs,"pause it at 2:07

CmRih_VtVAs,"feel the actor will doing fine with the material they have but its the script, directing, choices for what direction for this movie that will harm this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,i want to see it so bad
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow does this want to be guardians of the galaxy so badly, what would make this movie better would be if it was rated R because you have what the worst of the worst, then we should see it, if dead pool can have rated R film why not this one?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"(Comic Con footage drops, with a more somber tone)

""DC movies are too serious and angsty.  They should be more lighthearted, like Marvel!""

(First full trailer drops, with a more insane, upbeat, comedic tone) 

""Now they're just ripping off Marvel!""

*facepalm*"
CmRih_VtVAs,Modern day Dirty Dozen if only Lee Marvin was in it!
CmRih_VtVAs,yea
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie is Smokin,  worth the price of admission right there."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks promising.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I always thought that Suicide Squad would be better if they tried to be a little more like Guardians of the Galaxy and a little less mopey.
Now I want them to stop cribbing off of Guardians of the Galaxy.
Who gave you the fucking right to use Bohemian Rhapsody in your dumb little trailer?
I don't know what I want anymore."

CmRih_VtVAs,That was an excellent song choice for the trailer. Fit perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Margot Robbie just doing an even worse version of Baby from House of 1000 corpses?
CmRih_VtVAs,I really can't tell if I think I'll like this movie or not. Why does that one girl have flies swarming around her body?
CmRih_VtVAs,Any chance these goosebumps will go away?

CmRih_VtVAs,God I love this song
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wonder if there will be any kind of origin story for the Joker in this one, like in the form of a flashback or something. While I am a fan of Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight, I am NOT a fan of the decision to not give him a backstory and I definitely wasnt crazy about his overall look in that film. War paint / make-up? Really?? I kinda like the idea of him being disfigured from getting dropped in a tub of chemicals like in Tim Burton's version. From the looks of it, thats the direction theyre going with this one cuz his whole body is pale white. But Im curious to see if they actually show his transformation at some point in the movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder what will happen if michael bay was the director of this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"that was a stupid trailer, the faulty one was way better"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so hyped

CmRih_VtVAs,shit yes i'll watch this fo sure
CmRih_VtVAs,muito bom. passem no meu camal...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Your move, Marvel."
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:09 what do you mean ""you people?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Love this omfg I love this
CmRih_VtVAs,Love this
CmRih_VtVAs,Love this
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST.TRAILER.EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:06 Fun little tid bit, the shirt at 2:06 says ""If you want peace, prepare for war"" in Latin."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, because the trailer is just full of action, that i dont know. Btw shit trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,ART
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer overkill!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 you're welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,Sings along to Bohemian Rhapsody.....
CmRih_VtVAs,SOO COOL!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,L
CmRih_VtVAs,Song: Darude - Sandstorm
CmRih_VtVAs,"One of those villains costumes is disturbing, I don't want to look at him for 2 hrs in 3d.... But besides that lol, it looks good."
CmRih_VtVAs,NetFlix  ????
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant stop watching this trailer!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley! ❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,this is going to be a good year for dc
CmRih_VtVAs,Yo sólo quiero ver por WILL SMITH.... Los demás son relleno
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sorry but Jared Leto's look for the joker just doesn't fit. The tattoos and jewelry ruins it. He might have the attitude for the character but I need to see the purpose. Joker isn't just about being a psychopath.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate this trailer the first one was better
CmRih_VtVAs,This is literally the equivalent of DC's version of Guardian of the Galaxy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1st thought: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty? 
Last thought: Holy shit that's the hot chick from the wolf of Wall Street?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,many memories and action I cried OK I cried damn I love DC and marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,many memories and action I cried OK I cried damn I love DC and marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Sorry to break your hearts guys but I think I will love this Movie more than Batman V Superman:)
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the only DC movie that actually looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,Good year to be a Marvel and DC movie fan
CmRih_VtVAs,Tbh im more excited 4 dis movie than BvS 😆💯
CmRih_VtVAs,"Darude -Sandstorm
for anyone looking for the song to this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,I've never been exited to see a DC movie until now. Not hating but the DC movies were never that good in my opinion like the batman/Dark Knight  and superman movies I've always preferred the marvel movies (can't wait for DEADPOOL!) not that I don't like dc I always enjoyed the arkham games and justice league war also the suicide squad animated film.
CmRih_VtVAs,This joker is just a disgrace to Heath Ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd like to see Marvel pull off a movie like this
CmRih_VtVAs,"My only complaint with this, is that Harley doesn't sound like Harley. That's the ONLY thing that bugs me. If she somehow changes her accent near the end of the movie because the Joker likes it, then I'll be 100% satisfied. :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Finaly! A million dollar movie shot in Toronto!!! plot twist! Doesn't take place in Toronto 1 like=1 cry
CmRih_VtVAs,what is about me laughing at people when they come out bags and starts beating the living s*** out of everybody
CmRih_VtVAs,"don't know about the movie, but whoever edited this trailer deserves an award."
CmRih_VtVAs,so we have to wait till august??!! fk that
CmRih_VtVAs,Words can't even describe how excited I am for this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Darude / Sandstorm - for everybody, who is looking for the music."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This new Joker is badass! Although I do miss the old one, this new one seems more psychotic & reckless, refreshing."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm far more hyped for Batman v Superman but this trailer does look cool and, I might even go see Suicide Squad when it comes out in August."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Does anybody know the ""Mama Mia Mama Mia"" song at 1:21?"
CmRih_VtVAs,who is the villian at 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,0:12 is that will smith??
CmRih_VtVAs,i love how the first trailer was all serious but now its just so alive
CmRih_VtVAs,My congratulations to whoever did the audio mixing for this trailer. Excellent work!
CmRih_VtVAs,Yay queen
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so shitty. Will smith ruins it
CmRih_VtVAs,"They f*ck it up when they keep making the bad guys say

>hurrdurr we need to save the world
>Hurrdurrrr we are the bad guys its what we do

No F*cking Sh*t, please fill the movie with more lines stating the obvious"
CmRih_VtVAs,i hate the new joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Was hoping to see king shark,is he really in the movie???"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's fucking lit
CmRih_VtVAs,That last scene is literally me when I'm bored. XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Comes of like a Guardians of the Galaxy wanna be based on this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't remember Harley being THAT insane.
CmRih_VtVAs,so anyone excited for the witch girl idk i like the kinky stuff also harley quinn was kinda hot deadshot looked way better then in the comics and crossovers. Still i dont like the jokers new look not the face but the suit that's all
CmRih_VtVAs,This is quite literally one of the most edgy things I've ever seen I'm glad u 13 year old's  will enjoy this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks to me that Harley Quinn is not quite right, she doesn't seem crazy in this trailer. Just acting silly. 

Also the joker has weird bling on his teeth, which looks strange, I mean the guy has always been about his smile, and even that is fucked up now."
CmRih_VtVAs,Премьера?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Welcome to the comment section of the Suicide Squad trailer, where everybody has apparently seen the fucking movie 8 months in advance"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith Ruins this for me Im sorry
CmRih_VtVAs,Like for the Song... QUEEN FOREVER
CmRih_VtVAs,What the fuck is Will smith doing in this movie...already going to fucking hate it!! Thanks will
CmRih_VtVAs,"Epic Trailer 
I love It <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,this will make my 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury brought me here.
CmRih_VtVAs,ohhhh Harley quinn mmmmm
CmRih_VtVAs,is this a rip off of the avergers
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quin is fucking insane! I love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sweet, pretty much just saw the whole movie just now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"this could be the joker that is originally robin/jason todd,look at the similarities he has,the scars on his body similarised the one on BvS the robin suit that was damaged and he has a J on his face like the one robin has on a comic,spoiler alert,it could be jason todd"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:09 was me the whole time waching this
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:08 , that sneak peak he took of Harley Quinn's ass lmao"
CmRih_VtVAs,harley needs her hammer not a bat
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so waiting for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that the Lazarus pit?
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMAIAN RAPSODY!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The jokers laugh is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:04 Extra of the Year Oscar goes to that chick. Love it when extras in movies are so good they tell a whole story in a few seconds. Such as this woman, who is most certainly tired of this dudes bullshit, but not so tired she doesn't still find humor in it. Well done, random jailer extra chick."
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song
CmRih_VtVAs,"So...if the bad guys are the ""good"" guys who are the bad guy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one of the best trailers i've ever seen in my entire life! Holy shit
CmRih_VtVAs,i have  a nerdgasm and i love it 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Explosion!  Excitement!  Kick ass song!

BOOM - it all stops

Baseball bat to a window...always halted by a baseball bat to the window.  Can't wait to see this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This>BvS 
Captain America>BvS
Anything other than BvS>BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Boatloads of teens running into Queen channel in 4,3,2..."
CmRih_VtVAs,👌🏻👌🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,freddy mercury brought me here..who with me??
CmRih_VtVAs,Heyhey
CmRih_VtVAs,?
CmRih_VtVAs,Boheam Rapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara'!!!!❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck the haters Will Smith looks amazing as Deadshot.
CmRih_VtVAs,was that the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks better than Superman vs Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx lucian brand shaco..
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad is one of the very few movies I'm looking forward to in 2016. This looks really good!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks funny as hell
CmRih_VtVAs,"I looks okay, but then, it timed up really nicely with Queen and it's clouding my judgement..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"is tom hardy in the trailer?? im really confused, cuz i hear his voice"
CmRih_VtVAs,Listen everyone! If HarleyQuinn had the high pitched annoying voice throughout the movie she would be hated and no actress is gonna get an award talking like an 4 year old girl for 2-3 hours. Have you played arkham that HarleyQuinn was cool but had such a whiny irritating voice
CmRih_VtVAs,Too much cringe
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beast Native American at 0:59..

Now I have to go see the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Does the girl with pigtails remind anyone else of Lollipop Chainsaw?
CmRih_VtVAs,That's not the real joker....muahahahhaahhaahahahhaha PLOT TWIST!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,it'd be cool if the entire suicide squad was in it
CmRih_VtVAs,We need Deadpool to join this Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know the name of the song as it reminds me a lot like the one in Wayne's World.
CmRih_VtVAs,But deadshot died rescuing those hostages with diggle..
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Worst... Heroes... Ever."" 
My son's response to this is 
""Not my fault! Tucker Did it!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,looks sick
CmRih_VtVAs,Why cant it be august now?! 😫😫
CmRih_VtVAs,When porn does better harley than Hollywood
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant believe cara is there!
CmRih_VtVAs,meh..... not feeling it.
CmRih_VtVAs,DC comics version of Disney's Descendants!
CmRih_VtVAs,metete a mi canal Valeria Arvizu Hernandez
CmRih_VtVAs,.....at least the music was decent....don't know about the movie tho.....
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Comic Book Movie Trailer ever. Period.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else hear Captain Boomerang screaming whenever they listen to this song now?
CmRih_VtVAs,so they got enchantress boyfriend to hunt her down n joker is just there to make a bad situation worse lol
CmRih_VtVAs,so they got enchantress boyfriend to hunt her down n joker is just there to make a bad situation worse lol
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you do a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,what the fuck is this it looks dope but I'm mad asf  that the person that plays the Joker looks nothing like the fucking joker putting on red lipstick and dyeing your hair green doesn't  make you the Joker the jokers teeth aren't all blinded up nor does he have them tattos like wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so stoked for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Return of the scene kids

CmRih_VtVAs,Any film that uses Bohemian Rhapsody in its trailer is a good film.
CmRih_VtVAs,this film is gonna be sick
CmRih_VtVAs,"I could be wrong, but this seems like DC is trying too hard to be cool and funny"
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is BEAUTIFULLY edited!! can't wait!
I like how the teaser was very dark but this one is more upbeat. I hope the film is the middle ground of both!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I only want to watch it because Will Smith is in it and what is the name of this song
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer has 3 days on and has 21,341,321 views!!!!!!!!!! HOLY SHIT!!! is awesome my gosh,  Bohemian Rhapsody .. the feelings!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who made this trailer? This is one of the best movie trailers I've seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn looks PERFECT
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Katana survives the experience. She looks like she is attacked by Killer Croc.
CmRih_VtVAs,the irony is the  bad guys are bring controlled by supposedly good guys. the song in the beginning of the trailer indicates that human society is a makeup of the good guys fantasy which created everything in the society and is trying to control society. Which makes them the real bad guys.

CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 God, help me"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone complaining that it doesn't seem dark enough. First of all, watch some of the scenes in the trailer (such as Deadshot getting beaten by the guards) I doubt they'll have the song playing during this scene in the actual movie lol. The song is used metaphorically, ironically, etc. And if anyone has read the comics they'll agree that there's quite a bit of humour in them- including dark humour. Don't let a trailer shift your view of the movie. Still looks like it will be great either way. DC knows what they're doing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Marco Robbie is going to steal the fucking show
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,So... Harley doesn't have a creepy obsession with Joker now? She's way out of his league in this..
CmRih_VtVAs,What's this movie rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is that the real Jai,
And is that Margot Robbie,
I hope he isn't as bad as,
All his other movies 🎶

"
CmRih_VtVAs,"so why I don't see any ""kids in africa..."" comment?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see this!!...
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't bother asking what song it is.
CmRih_VtVAs,My birthday is in August
CmRih_VtVAs,What age rating is this?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey guys. I'm a little bitch and I don't like that DC is experimenting. I mean, listen to these cliche lines. Everyone knows that trailers NEVER use the most cliche lines in the movie to sum up the tone. And what's the deal with this non-emo shit? Bohemian Rhapsody? A song with A TEMPO in a DC trailer? HUMOROUS DIALOGUE? Ugh, I can't believe DC isn't being overly serious and brooding to cater to my sense of adulthood anymore. They're just copying Marvel, their sole competitor and basically the only thing they have to draw outside inspiration from. You have fallen from grace, DC. Please, bring back boring, cardboard characters and dialogue so I can feel edgy again."
CmRih_VtVAs,"en Español, Laino..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Next to Mad Max Fury Road this is probably one of the best edited Trailer of all time
CmRih_VtVAs,Me convencio la cansion de queen de ver la pelicula 😋
CmRih_VtVAs,I see you Michigan shirt guy in the background at 0:39. Go Blue.
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont know is this movie gonna be awesome it just doesnt have rigth actors
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 Dat Ass!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,ohh shit...anotha one
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited to see Margot Robbie as Harley Quin n that the movie itself
CmRih_VtVAs,Slade Wilson is in this
CmRih_VtVAs,0:18 thought that was shia labeouf
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hyped af for this movie. Fuck the animated one, that one sucked ass"
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel better by far, this looks like it tried to hard on being comedic."
CmRih_VtVAs,Im the only one who thinks Captain Boomerang will  probably be one of funniest characters? lol he looks si damn crazy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Mastodon > Queen
Queen sucks!"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC to MARVEL: I Cant wait to show you my TOYS :)
CmRih_VtVAs,maybe they just want you to thinks its comidec wait till the movie comes out bevor judjing
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAME HERE FOR JARED AND BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie alongside the Deadpool movie is going to be in my 2016 to-watch list for sure.
CmRih_VtVAs,when is it coming out
CmRih_VtVAs,"At the very beginning you can see the phrase ""Firm but fair"" on the side of the walkway. This is a common technique used to tech children good behavior. 

Definitely _not_ what Amanda Waller uses on the squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,captain America looks awesome in this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I must say a great song to go with the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad > Civil War
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so glad they didn't make killer croc with CGI.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 would be me in a fire fight.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker Looks Freaking Awesome...I hope the movie is as good as the trailer tho
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks really good. Mood: Excited.
CmRih_VtVAs,it's epic
CmRih_VtVAs,it's epic
CmRih_VtVAs,look my chaine and my video pls
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED TO SEE THIS
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or does captain boomerang look like sheamus from wwe 😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that cara?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel... only God can save you now. Oh wait, there is no God. Well, you're f*cked anyway!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched this trailer twice a day since it came out
CmRih_VtVAs,ios device video screen recorder check it out
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yikes, don't get me wrong I want to see this as much as the next guy but I have a bad feeling about Harley Quinn's portrayal here. I feel that she's psycho but not in the right way"
CmRih_VtVAs,another potentially good movie comes out near the end of next year hate that
CmRih_VtVAs,the moment she/he says : what!!!! i should kill everyone and escape and that smile/i cant wait to show you my toys...
CmRih_VtVAs,So the DC version of Monsters vs Aliens!? :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Asdadasdasd Create Is Trolling
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 winks
CmRih_VtVAs,will Smith is playing as deathstroke stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, I think Jai Courtney is gonna happen."
CmRih_VtVAs,+curiouspeanut I'm not saying that it's a bad thing. I think it's badass
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't believe this film is being made before freaking Wonder Woman or The Flash
CmRih_VtVAs,"СЛЮНКИ ТЕКУТ, ааааааааааааааааааааАААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА! ЖЕСТЬ!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker has the same laugh as Mr.Nobody
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hang on, Deadshot isn't black."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I CAN WAIT! Can we give Will Smith a Oscar nod so the baby wont cry about his performance! Sorry Jared Leto it clear your great actor for 2016, but W.Smith is going to throw the race card...."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Eh, style of joker..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is epic
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks kindof retarded
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how different this trailer is than other superhero movies. The music choice was phenomenal unlike the usual serious chorus or really techno music. Just made me a lot more excited for the movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,dis gon be good
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really hope this is trailer 1 of 1.  Sick of movies making 6 trailers, which I of course have to click on and ruin the best parts of the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn !!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think is like this trailer 100% more just because of the usage of Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"What if this movie shows a new story about how The Joker and Harley met? They could say that Harley Quinn had always been crazy, but that Joker wasn't what turned her. That could just both be homicidal jokesters that happen across each other in this movie.

Or they could just say that this is a new Joker and the old one is dead. then maybe this Joker, which was seen pulling Harley out of the water in the trailer, could be attracted to her because she was the old Joker's girlfriend"
CmRih_VtVAs,queen - mama
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,"Villains becomes superheroes !!
Well that's a new one!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Thats a hell of a trailer! I hope the movie will be like this
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC IS THE BEST, BvS and this will be awesome, RIP MARVEL"
CmRih_VtVAs,idk why everybody likes harley quinn shes a nobody with no super powers !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best song ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, Joker looks pretty cool...
love the way he sounds and the make up on him is sublime.. Scary AF :0"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is how a lunatic would see guardians of the galaxy! its amazing. can't wait!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best movie trailers ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley makes me feel like a raging virgin again! Oh the things I would do too Harley... I would make hardcore adult 18+ xxx porn films look like family movies lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,WHY AM I WATCHING THIS TWO DAYS AFTER IT WAS RELEASED THIS IS AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,0:03 is me in school lol
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie brought to you by tumblr...
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPEHYPEHYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dont care what the story is,I just think its going to be a badass"
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn I can't wait to see his toys!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'd probably be all in with this movie if they hadn't given the Joker all those fucking lame tattoos and that stupid-ass ""grill"" he's got in his mouth. I'm sure Leto will make a fine Joker but did they really have to tat him up like seemingly every 20-something on earth today? Also not too big on Harley Quinn thus far. Feels/looks like a different character entirely and doesn't make me think of Harley Quinn whatsoever. Apart from those two complaints, at least it looks entertaining enough.

/awaits your ""lol fuck you faggot!!!1"" responses."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury Brought me here!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:15 first fap
CmRih_VtVAs,Working in the industry I'm gonna have to say 'Fuck this bullshit' because they allow women with little experience and skill to do stunts while demanding that the men come in with a large range of stuff and look like they can handle damage (not toned athletic guys but large bodybuilders while women can be scrawny as fuck). I'm tired of women spreading a bullshit narrative that they are held back in the industry because it's flat out false.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen <3 perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Hit like those who got to remember of Freddie Mercury after watching this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevingne!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Isn't he the new robocop 2:09
CmRih_VtVAs,was that harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,no matter how much hate dc gets all the time. this will be block buster !!!!! batman v superman will be critical fail but box office champ. this how ever could be the most grossing movie of 2016.
CmRih_VtVAs,*orgasms*
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm getting a Saints Row vibe from this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,we're bad guys. that's what we do 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Bruh.
CmRih_VtVAs,"First we had Marvel fans vs DC fans, and now we have BvS fans vs SS fans. what is this stupidity. cant we get excited for both SS and BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,This gave me goosebumps!!! So pumped for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,watching this for the 100th time.
CmRih_VtVAs,When Are gonna see Spider-Man's Role
CmRih_VtVAs,If you look carefully when Joker is pulling Harley from the Chemicals a heart is formed
CmRih_VtVAs,"They used my favorite band for trailers, The Bee Gees and then Queen. What's next? Michael Jackson?
Sign me uup"
CmRih_VtVAs,YAASS
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is prefect you see so many awesome things like when joker makes Harley how crazy they are killer croc just a great trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Heeeeej joel!!😘
CmRih_VtVAs,Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Replace Bohemian Rhapsody with Thomas the tank engine, still a badass trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Insanity!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Must see
CmRih_VtVAs,Idę na to do kina.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it normal to have a heart attack from watching something so badass and to laugh hysterically when you're going to go broke from the DC movies
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG! Queen <3 you got me
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this is pg 13 because I want to see this soooo bad😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,I think the Joker looks a little bit too young... He isnt that crazy as in The Dark Knight
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think I count for at least 1,000 views of this video after seeing it over and over again"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song choice honestly couldnt have been better. THIS TRAILER IS MY 2nd FAVORITE TRAILER EVER! And my most anticipated movie of 2015. Whoever picked the song and matched it with the clips is truly a genius and a gifted person.
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that is how you make a fucking good trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks shit Harley quinn looks stupid hasn't even got the voice down, fucking jared Leto can't act he is a complete dick with no talent and killer croc looks like he is made of playdo fuck you suicide squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED TO SEE THIS
CmRih_VtVAs,I just love the song
CmRih_VtVAs,This will make Bohemian Rhapsody so much more popular
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've seen this trailer now about 15 times I must just say: This is an artistic masterpiece. How it's cut with the music, just perfect!"
CmRih_VtVAs,xD.. total awesomeness
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 she looks like Emma Watson :)
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is gonna flop big time. I bet ppl will just see this for the action. The line delivery is bad!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Raphsody just fits in everything
CmRih_VtVAs,why would you dislike this?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks pretty fun to watch. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks so much better than the avengers
CmRih_VtVAs,Christians claim you can only go to heaven if you accept jesus as your lord and saviour...... So what about the hundreds of millions of people that was around before jesus was born...      And when people claim to see a ghost why do they never claim to see a caveman ghost. It seems the ghosts only started appearing in the 16th or 17th century.
CmRih_VtVAs,joker and harley are fuckin poetic in this movie fucked up..but poetic
CmRih_VtVAs,finally a good dc movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sensational! Helmo,  fireman fold # !!!"

CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Deadshot all ruined in one movie. Good job assholes fucking up my Harley!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Pause on 2:07 TRUST ME!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, now you have my fully attention DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I never imagine bohemian rhapsody would be a song for a trailer movie, and I must say IS PERFECT <3!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw that a lot of time
CmRih_VtVAs,"Screw Star Wars, this is the movie I can't wait for..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen *.*
CmRih_VtVAs,Enyone knows the song name??
CmRih_VtVAs,Heavy!
CmRih_VtVAs,why are the particle effects around the enchantress so.... bad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tu Polska przejmujemy ten film :D PAMIĘTACIE ?

CmRih_VtVAs,I wish harley kept her accent...
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 DAT Ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool
CmRih_VtVAs,who the hell is that at 1:44? Swamp Thing? Poison Ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is giving me a boner
CmRih_VtVAs,They could have included a few Joker dialogues in.
CmRih_VtVAs,8=D
CmRih_VtVAs,Garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,What really made this trailer great for me was queen in the backround
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn OMG I  love you
CmRih_VtVAs,1:24 looks like a masterpiece
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 1:43-1:44

Who is that guy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think casting could have been more perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it wrong that what I am most looking forward to in this movie is seeing Harley Quinn in live action?
CmRih_VtVAs,correction I don't think I've ever seen a fist bump timed so damn perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,"LOL Bohemian Rapsody most random song for a film called ""Suicide Squad"""
CmRih_VtVAs,As a die hard Marvel fan I can say I have never been more excited for a comic movie ever. This movie is going to completely revolutionalize how DC movies are looked at. This is really setting the bar for other movies after this one!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:38.    wwe
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG Queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks fuckin sick , cant wait to see leto's performance.. I'm sure he nails it hard"
CmRih_VtVAs,"WOW!!
Diablo, looks like RICO BOY (zombie boy)-.
AND THIS MOTHERFUCKER JOKER UFFF!!! FANTASTIC!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC SONG COMFIRMED
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is fucking hilarious. So excited for Katana in suicide squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith Cool!
CmRih_VtVAs,new kind........music is unique
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:00 it was like Parker from leverage
CmRih_VtVAs,Cuando se estrena?
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks fucking amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst heroes? They're not heroes!
CmRih_VtVAs,@1:36 opening a can of beer in the middle of a fire fight. This movie gonna be mind fucking awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot and Cara are so gorgeous💓
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does killer Kroc look more like jeepers creepers than what he should look like?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC & WB's are in BBBBIIGGGGG  TTTRROOUUBBBLLLEEE!!!!
NO $$$$$ 4 UUUU!!! NNNEEXXTTT!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man, the thing I love about Leto's Joker, from what I've seen so far, is that he seems to be VERY genuinely sadistic. I really believe that he wants to hurt that guy in the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,The whole time I was thinking July 2018 or something
CmRih_VtVAs,"▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

CmRih_VtVAs,I bet Will Smith's character is going to be the most boring out of them all... Also HOLY SHIT! That girl playing Harlequin is amazing... Who's she?
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it
CmRih_VtVAs,The casts are everything
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I peed a little watching this.  This is going to be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,"*pauses at 2:07
Hahahahaaaa.....aaahh ok this is now my favorite movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,No entendi nada de lo que hablaron :v
CmRih_VtVAs,Enchantress at 1:26 so sexy...
CmRih_VtVAs,My god hearly sounds horrid...
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who thinks about jinx in LoL?
CmRih_VtVAs,"BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, OH MY GOD
OH
MY
GOOOOOOOOOOOD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Haha what an edgy loud imax cgi porn piece of shit. I bet this gonna be bad just like the other overhyped movies of the past years. Queen sountrack on the tariler not gonna change that.
CmRih_VtVAs,i'll definitely watch this movie but i'm still telling you: cara should've not been in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love 01:25 ""Beelzebub"" and Enchantress shot..."

CmRih_VtVAs,"if something starts with a song from the Queen, you know it will be AWESOME AF!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The views 😮😰
CmRih_VtVAs,That is how to trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is so BATSHIT sexy
CmRih_VtVAs,"pros of the suicide squad movie: seeing margot robbie having fun acting and her harley quinn

cons of the suicide squad movie:people are going to all be like ''being crazy is so kewl'' and the quirky mental illness trope will be more popular than ever"
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 Harley Quinn is so fucking sexy, she drives me sexy."
CmRih_VtVAs,20.000.000 already? this gonna hit fucking 100.000.000 xd

CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 look at that ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ive seen Deadshot several times but i havent seen him as african-american but that isnt as important as the actor. Will Smith is the only big name actor and I dont really know if he actually be good as a stoic death-seeking serial killer.

I wonder if the characters will have some of their distinguishing costumes and equipment or just generic clothing. Deadshot without his wrist guns feels wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,Esse filme promete ser muito bom pelo visto
CmRih_VtVAs,"When HQ breaks the shop window at 2:07, the phrase on the t-shirt: Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum translates to "" if you want peace, prepare for war"".  Flagg ; ""Seriously! What's wrong with you people?""       ""HQ ; ""We're bad guys. That's what we do!"""

CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 2:04, her necklace says ""PUDDIN""."
CmRih_VtVAs,The moment when leto jumps off from the building is just epic
CmRih_VtVAs,Trop hate !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Margots acting looks quite poor now we see more clips of her hmmmm
CmRih_VtVAs,i love this
CmRih_VtVAs,DC has so many universes

CmRih_VtVAs,Olm böle fragmanmı olurmu la müthiş yalnız marvel ve dc bendeki bütün parayı yiyo mk sinamaya en az bu sne 100 lira gidecek ben öğrenci adamım mk
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like this one has everything DC movies have lacked- fun
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool and Suicide Squad are Rated-R superheroes movies that what i Iove. Screwed Batman vs. Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,thus movie looks like it's gonna suck ass
CmRih_VtVAs,....motherfucking awesome!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate Will Smith so much.

CmRih_VtVAs,Still have no interest...
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait Cara Delevingne! Hell yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,cool
CmRih_VtVAs,More like TRYHARD SQUAD
CmRih_VtVAs,next suicide squad with Margot Robby I think it would be better for her not to wear short shorts
CmRih_VtVAs,Has anyone figured out who Scott Eastwood is suppose to be playing?
CmRih_VtVAs,ELECTRA HEART IS NOT DEAD :v  🌝✨
CmRih_VtVAs,0:18 SPOOKED!
CmRih_VtVAs,Seems legitimate
CmRih_VtVAs,must be funny
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think the second target will be Harley, since she will betray the team and join Joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really like this trailer, but I think it's misleading. People will think this is suppose to be DC's comedic response to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, but its not, the movie will be more in line with the first trailer. Margot Robbie said in a interview that the tone of the movie is more ""Dark Knight"" than ""Avengers"". Again, great trailer, but hope this doesn't mislead and upset people when they actually watch the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect music 👏👏❤

CmRih_VtVAs,i wish harley quinn had an accent .......
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks better than BvS in every way shape and form! Is that actually... Personality I see
CmRih_VtVAs,it kinda reminds me Batman Assault on Arkham animated movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or Margot is doing a Sofia Vergara impression? :p
CmRih_VtVAs,This already has 303K likes and this has been out for 3 days but the civil war trailer has 309K likes and that's been out for 1 month...  Think about that
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else notice that Katanna is in this?
CmRih_VtVAs,great
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this joker or a male version of miley cyrus. I don't know which one's scarier.
CmRih_VtVAs,mama miaaa!..............it's fffffffffffffffffffffUCKING AWESOOOOOOOOOME !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This has one of the most perfect uses of Bohemian Rhapsody since Wayne's World

CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone thinking Harley Quinn is going to side with the joker but then die
CmRih_VtVAs,Just me or Harley Quinn's dialogues are extremely pathetic?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney looks like Tom Hardy in this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Stop trying to make Jai Courtney a thing. It's just not gonna happen
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm pretty sure we could convince one of these bad guys to release the movie before August.
CmRih_VtVAs,needs more Liam Neeson!

CmRih_VtVAs,ABOUT DAMN TIME DC
CmRih_VtVAs,wats the song
CmRih_VtVAs,The most ethnically diverse task force in DC is a band of criminals.
CmRih_VtVAs,I was disappointed that Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn didn't use her New York accent like she did in Wolf of Wall street.😢
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like a shitty movie
CmRih_VtVAs,0:55 this is me at school and the rest of the suicide squad are like my friends... All just crazy people
CmRih_VtVAs,the ppl who made this trailer deserve an emmy-award. BEST . TRAILER. EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the music
CmRih_VtVAs,can someone tell me every song name used in this trailer ????? pleaseee !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"can somebody kill me? pls, i need to die"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen is bae!
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this is longer than the dark knight
CmRih_VtVAs,I can already tell that Harley Quinn is a bad actress
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk why but it feels like DC is trying to turn this into Guardians...especially with the classic rock music in the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"FUCK YOU MARVEL!!!!!!
DC ERA IS COMING..."
CmRih_VtVAs,o dlç cara
CmRih_VtVAs,i already know that margot robbie is harley queen like Hugh jackman is wolverine and Robert Downey Jr is tony stark
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 best scene!
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer did the impossible and made Jai Courtney look as if he's a good actor
CmRih_VtVAs,another trash movie to fill your brains with shit
CmRih_VtVAs,looks unreal!
CmRih_VtVAs,captain boomerang is like an Australian Bronson in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,is this 18+?
CmRih_VtVAs,курочка ряба
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this a league of legends IRL movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,gerilla
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel your time is done DC is coming...

Nevermind i was wrong this is a classic case of trailer being better than the actual movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Already has more views in two days than the other Batman v Superman trailer. Shows you how shit the trailer was.
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool es mejor pelicula
CmRih_VtVAs,Badass
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain BOOMERANG!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harlequin rules.....
CmRih_VtVAs,Why are Dc villians more colourful than the hero's and why does marvel have the reverse issue. Do both people do both!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,dam they are really the worst hero's
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Being a bad/good guy is relative""

- Suicide Squad movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw the cartoon. For some  reason they replaced Killer Frost with some weird witch...
CmRih_VtVAs,What the song of this trailer??
CmRih_VtVAs,"01:06 they synced the lines so that ""bismillah"" chanting wouldn't be heard. and i think they removed mercury's voice as well when he said bismillah the second time, only instrumentals. why? i guess people would flip if they heard that, typical americans, making american producers nervous as fuck. nice hate and paranoia ridden country we have, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Not sure how I feel about Harley Quinn. It's probably because I'm so used to Tara Strong playing her
CmRih_VtVAs,I KNEW YOU HAD IT IN YOU/ HOW DO YOU DOD  COPY IMAGINE WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ABOUT THAT 11
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is similar yo batman arkham assault
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is just amazing. I don't recognize the member that they say is possessed by a witch.
CmRih_VtVAs,People tend to hate Jai Courtney in everything he acts in but am I the only one who thinks that he might steal the show? He looks and acts like a shitbag just like the comics and I like it!
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice trailer. I love the soundtrack!
CmRih_VtVAs,i just can't wait to see the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker died with Heath Ledger!
Miss so much the ORIGINAL characters! The ORIGINAL comic books were destroyed with this shit!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly if without robbie margot as harley in this film,  this would not be so interesting to watch."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will be shite.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker still looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,ONE OF THE BEST TRAILERS
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really don't like the Joker's appearance, but the movie looks fantastic!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm happy now
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie looks HOT as Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,LOL. Something tells me Captain Boomerang and Deadshot are going to be clashing heads with one another throughout the film.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG i can't wait for it to come out !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool didn't approve on this....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, this song's popularity just skyrocketed for the younger generation."
CmRih_VtVAs,this is going to be a disaster
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer has such a different atmosphere compared to the first one.
But I absolutely LOVE IT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley sounds just like me... Should I be worried?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks incredible.
CmRih_VtVAs,i honestly think that harley quinn is overrated
CmRih_VtVAs,"People calling out Marvel lmao, just wait for Guardians of the Galaxy, this shit is more like Guardians Squad hahaha."
CmRih_VtVAs,"omgggg i cant wait to seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee itttttt""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't forget about the wonder woman movie too. She makes her first appearance in batman vs. superman
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 oie zhi
CmRih_VtVAs,This video has almost 21.000.000 views but it doesn't really count since atleast 63% of the views are mine :/
CmRih_VtVAs,film?
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who has seen the trailer 100 times?
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is perfect as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto looks great as the joker and will smith looks like he makes a great dead shot
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY HARLEY HARLEY
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is seriously hot. Talented and sexy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"All you had to do was make a Batman Arkham movie or some shit, am I the only one that thinks this looks shit? That cringey Harley Quinn acting, Jared Leto's pathetic Joker impersonation that for some reason people like, Will Smith as Deadshot? Eeeeeeeeeh, we'll see how that one goes, but fuck me this movie looks like it's gonna be shit on top of the half decent looking Batman v Superman garbage, fuck me you had one job!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rapsody in the background 👌👌👌 the guy who came up with that needs a pay raise 😂😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody just fits in with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,why is Katana in this? I thought she was a good guy.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm dressed like El Chapo in his prime. I will change your bum life. Nobody can take the left hand.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, Cara Delevingne in a swamp bath...?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm prolly gonna get a lot of hate for this...but I got a little upset because I was half expecting to hear Arleen Sorkin's voice come out of Margot Robbie's mouth... Especially in the ""We're bad guys it's what we do"" part."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or does Harley Quinn seem like the only one with a personality?
CmRih_VtVAs,0:47 he looks like one of the goombas from that super Mario film
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody it's to big for this movie....😜
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was weird.  From the song choice to all the crazy stuff happening.  I honestly don't know what to say
CmRih_VtVAs,bet slipknot and El Diablo die
CmRih_VtVAs,2:31
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:22 did they cut the word new? all I can hear is ""I can't wait to show you my........ toys"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"They take britains best looking model, and make her a ugly witch. Rip"
CmRih_VtVAs,ESTA MUITO FIXE
CmRih_VtVAs,Love it !❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,The song name is Darude- Sandstorm incase your wondering
CmRih_VtVAs,a ok tanks

CmRih_VtVAs,ow the edge squad
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like that music the music on the other trailer is better
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats it rated
CmRih_VtVAs,where is the joker? WHERE IS THE FUKCING REAL JOKER?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm calling it now: Slipknot is so dead. If any member of the Squad is going to die in this movie, it's going to be him."
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC Trailer - Every beat of Music matches Visually - Can't STOP to press REWIND
CmRih_VtVAs,Peer pressure.
CmRih_VtVAs,mira mami sin batman :v
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Letos joker might be my favorite Joker so far. So much energy and insanity
CmRih_VtVAs,is it just me or did jared leto nailed a JOKER LAUGH
CmRih_VtVAs,looks more interesting than Batman Vs Superman ...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Leto looks seriously fucked up. I don't get the hate for him, he might turn out to be great. Remember how people complained about Ledger initially?"
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love that the last trailer was dark and that this one is super funny, it shows how unpredictable and unstable the characters are"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it me or does the canera LOVE Margot Robbie 😍😍😍 she's gonna kill this role & this movies gonna catapult her right to the A list.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker prototype from Gotham show was cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,OMGGGGG
CmRih_VtVAs,The people who disliked this are the justice league.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So are where were these trailer makers when Batman vs Superman needed it? 
If Deadpool is a hit I can see WB thinking on making the sequal to this R rated. Maybe."
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T WAIT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,CapGunTom
CmRih_VtVAs,yeeeeeeeeee
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker... OMG just amazing !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Где русские коменты????
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have to say, this Joker looks the best out of any other joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,bye bye Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"I mean how good is this frickin' trailer? Seriously folks, bloody well done."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody fits so well with this trailer... and its hilarious.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley sounds fucking annoying, but she's got enough Jinx in her that I like her..."
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN !
CmRih_VtVAs,"Never thought I'd say this in my life but....

Jai Courtney stole the show as Captain Boomerang in a movie starring the Joker,Harley Quinn,Batman and WILL SMITH!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does Cara Delevigne play the woman in the veil? And Harley and Joker look so cool😍
CmRih_VtVAs,badass
CmRih_VtVAs,The best trailer I've ever seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,"One thing I don't get, if they're out of that prison and have weapons, why don't they just, you know, escape?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks soooo good as the Joker!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Death Stroke Harley and Joker my favourites
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the at 1:44?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've watched this trailer like 20 times, looks so awesome, I'm more excited for this then batman vs superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can we just have this movie now?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let's get real, HARLEY QUINN IS THE MAIN REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE WATCHING"
CmRih_VtVAs,The fake ass song by fake ass Queen completely ruins an otherwise mediocre trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,dc movies are stepping up their game up
CmRih_VtVAs,seriously people will have a bit of an issue with jai courtney if they saw terminator genysis :/
CmRih_VtVAs,I guarantee this movie is gonna suck...
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song called?😎
CmRih_VtVAs,GREAT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 I'm going to love this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,You know what would be really scary? If Jared Letto dies one month before the film release.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks a little bit like everything's just flying around the screen, but it looks a hell of a lot better than Batman . Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,yeaaah Jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone think the villain might be abraxis??
CmRih_VtVAs,"""RATED PG"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"i don't get it, people on 9gag says that this will suck,

but it looks awesome tho."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Letos joker will def give Heath Ledgers joker a run for his money!!!  And RIP Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,such on that deadpool!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This will be the best superhero movie. P.S. If you are not considering DEADPOOL
CmRih_VtVAs,84.55.107.131

CmRih_VtVAs,вчера было 4 миллиона сегодня 20
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone notice Slipknot punch a woman? 0:39
CmRih_VtVAs,The shot of Leto screaming and shooting is so creepy!
CmRih_VtVAs,best part was when joker jumped off the ledge
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared *_*
CmRih_VtVAs,"Rest in peace, Marvel."
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone needs to make that Suicide Squad logo at the end into a poster or a neon light. That shit looks badass!!
CmRih_VtVAs,OH DAAAAMN FUCK BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY! IS IT JUST ME WHO GETS THE CHILLS WATCHING THIS OR WHAT?
CmRih_VtVAs,cheez hype
CmRih_VtVAs,"A trailer that makes Jai Kortney look watchable, well done."
CmRih_VtVAs,heh now I want to be gangsta and get a girlfriend like that <3 :D
CmRih_VtVAs,i bet that will smith is going to win an Oscar because there inst a lot of black Oscar winners.
CmRih_VtVAs,"cant wait to see Jared Leto and Margot Robbie as The Joker and Harley Quinn.

Can Jared Letto win the 2nd oscar cause this film ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,JOEL KINNAMAN & Will Smith ... OMG !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Love
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn ....Bohemian Rhapsody just takes it to a whole lighter level but fun yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate to say it, but it looks like Jai Courtney is gonna be great in this movie after all..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Shit we gotta wait till august :(
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else see the eyeball guy at 1:23 if so who is he?
CmRih_VtVAs,Will scarecrow or batman be in the movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is gonna be hilarious and a good way to continue the DC Cinematic Universe after Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,weres batman
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie trying to make me fall in love with a psychotic fictional character and shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:23 Nice smile, Jared ❤"
CmRih_VtVAs,what is a second song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"the film with Cara D. 10 / 10 
without Cara D. 6 / 10"
CmRih_VtVAs,"For fuck sake, this movie got so much antagonist, first joker, tatoo man then there is a theory about the girl possess by a witch(forgot her name) is also the antagonist"
CmRih_VtVAs,The fresh prince of bell-air. I hope charlton and uncle phil will be in this comedie too.  Its gona be hilarious. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I cannot wait for the inevitable Marvel/DC crossover event, Deadpool vs. Harley Quinn: Nooner of Insanity.  lol, but seriously, tho..."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 DAT ASS
CmRih_VtVAs,Sweet
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm starting to like the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, this trailer give me goosebumb."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, this trailer give me goosebumb."
CmRih_VtVAs,Terrible joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched it in 2054.. Old school movie
CmRih_VtVAs,又是一部不能在中国上映的电影
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 That better not be Harley Quinn....
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith!
CmRih_VtVAs,Used Queen song= Cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Sound Sync is perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's like they noticed the ""anti-heroes are cool"" trend and just went all the way with it. I'm on board."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:38, Damn.."
CmRih_VtVAs,This Will be the best dc ever !
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:25, THAT Ride tho <3"

CmRih_VtVAs,"0:28, Me VS Life"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Normally I try to stay away from movie trailers but I'm glad I saw this one.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not a dc fans, but this movie would be the best superheroes movie in 2016"
CmRih_VtVAs,AW
CmRih_VtVAs,Margo...ohhh...
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the joker look like a cross between David Bowie and Lil Jon...
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ;) You know what I mean
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ive never heard bohemian rhapsody sounding so good, does anyone know if this will be re released as the official trailer music or something?"
CmRih_VtVAs,For me the joker dont look crazier enough but im excited for this
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't know Emma Watson was gonna be in this...
CmRih_VtVAs,yasssss
CmRih_VtVAs,Отличную песню испоганили очередным бредом.
CmRih_VtVAs,DC tech has now discovered this thing called humor. They believe that it will make people want to watch there movies. The study is ongoing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"A lot of people are complaining that this movie is trying to hard to be ""edgy"". I can see that. But it looks like a fun movie and I can't wait to see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can we stop arguing and comparing who played Joker the best?! Heath Ledger , Jack Nicholson and Mark Hamill did a wonderful job portraying this complicated character and i think Jared will do his best, so stop all this nonsense."
CmRih_VtVAs,Any theories on who the main enemy is gonna be?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hola Papus emos (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,this is a good trailer but i still choose DeadPool instead :^
CmRih_VtVAs,"Any one else think they desperately needed to change the soundtrack of this trailer? I hope the movie isn't like that. Didn't fit the trailer, and it was so distracting for me, in a negative way. Ruined the mood of the trailer itself, for one that otherwise may have been at least decent."
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't give two shits about this movie when it was first announced but the trailer has definitely changed my mind.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best trailer ever. seriously can't wait for this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't wait to show you my new toys
CmRih_VtVAs,20 millions views
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx in League of Legends?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Q:Why is there so little of leto? 
Ans:Ya he is afraid of comparisons (u kno with whom 😒)"
CmRih_VtVAs,hay không thể tả
CmRih_VtVAs,I never thought I would hear gunshots in sync with a Queen song
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Capitan Boomerang doing anything else besides being scared?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Нет Марго Робби, всё таки зачетная деваха, даже без косметики и грима"
CmRih_VtVAs,NOW THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A TRAILER DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,i knew this is gonna be an epic trailer just from hearing the first tones of Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Tremble Marvel...
CmRih_VtVAs,The Harley quinn could be better... They could find someone more suitable for this role. She doesn't have the insanity that she should have. Only the makeup and the clothes make her part of the film..:/
CmRih_VtVAs,i think i'd like harley better w/ her original high pitched voice and accent but! this one's is perfect too! can't wait for the movie!! ♡♥♡
CmRih_VtVAs,Caraa 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman and superman will be so busy fighting they won't even realize this is going on :P
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling this movie will give me the feels ;w;
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks epic, seems like they actually did a good job."
CmRih_VtVAs,Esa jodida música es la que me ha hecho ver este trailer como 10 veces.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Was that a giant eye ball with a machine gun?

MARVEL IS SCREWED!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The best movie i'we ever seen on my entire life.
CmRih_VtVAs,joker 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Bad Ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Excellent use of Bohemian Rhapsody in my opinion.
CmRih_VtVAs,guys please subscribe to my channel :) it's new channel I created and waiting for subscribers :(
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer deserve Oscar...Best trailer ever made!
CmRih_VtVAs,how's the name of the theme song
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this shows that Joker(or someone) is really hard to beat.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't.Wait.Until.August.😨I.Want.It.Now!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What happened to DARK DC wtf Looks like DC is copying Marvel…Again
CmRih_VtVAs,TASTU!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:55 Is where captain boomerang is arrested
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait for the Joker to meet  Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:24 to 2:31 is the best part
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks that Harley Quinn is not that attractive?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Something about the way she says ""it's what we do"" with that head bob and eye roll. I'M IN LOVE"
CmRih_VtVAs,JARED LETO...WAHHHH
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks interesting...but by far one of the worst comic-to-movie trailers i've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg O.O
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect choice of song
CmRih_VtVAs,"So glad they used more humor in this trailer than at comic con. I was afraid of being bored out of my mind if I went to see it in theaters. Thankfully, Joker had that line about his ""toys"", along with about 50 other jokes, and the always awesome (if somewhat funny) Bohemian Rhapsody is the cherry on top."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The face jared leto pulls just makes this feel even more crazy, high expectations from this joker 1:22"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm going to bite the bullet and watch the trailer for this train-wreck of a movie. Wish me luck.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Very creative, nice."
CmRih_VtVAs,yes tom hardy is still in
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Mr Smith fails to get and Oscar for this, his wife's gonna be pissed."
CmRih_VtVAs,love everything in  this traileeeeer <3 Harley<3
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh was there not enough room for  Jai Courtney's name at the end there???????????????? fuck u, give that aussie legend some room on the goddamn suicide squad ending part there ya bunch of cunts"
CmRih_VtVAs,That girl reminds me of Jinx
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley steals the show in every single shot.
CmRih_VtVAs,Maybe jai courtney is actually gonna become a thing........
CmRih_VtVAs,Flop
CmRih_VtVAs,I fucking love 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,other then the actor for Harley this looks really good. wanted someone that's sounded more like the Arkham Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SOOOO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah!!!!! no 1 can stop me from watching this. 

(no human i mean)"
CmRih_VtVAs,hello (sorry for my bad english)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Near the end of the trailer when Harley Quinn steals the jewelry, it says ""si vis pacem para bellum"" meaning ""if you want peace, prepare for war"""
CmRih_VtVAs,TATSU YAMASHIRO is in Suicide Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg this is more awesome than the other one
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the girl.. she's funny xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"So I was wondering what Rick Flaggs motivation would be to lead the Suicide Squad and I think I've found it. I noticed in this official trailer that the Enchantress character is fixing Flaggs hair around the 0:45 mark. Then I went back to the Comic Con trailer and you can see her and him getting very close at the 1:58 mark. So to me it looks like they're some sort of intimate connection between the two and maybe he's trying to get her to snap back out of her witch form. Sorry if this is already out there, but I thought should share!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Did they became good guys???. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name of that last song
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What's that? You want me to kill everyone here? The voices. Just kidding, that's not what they said."" Finally they're making more movies with bat-s@#t crazy villians. Harley Quinn is now my new favorite psycho - y'know, after Deadpool. Can you imagine if these two had a crossover? O.O"
CmRih_VtVAs,WAWWWWWWW
CmRih_VtVAs,"leto is an insult to Heath Ledger. That was the ultimate Joker portrayal, i do not care that this is a different movie he should have been left out in respect to Heath."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Um...I had more faith, more draw, toward the production before it decided to be a generic action movie; with its stock comedic pauses and paint-by-numbers pop song. And I say that as a guy who was excited to hear 'Bohemian Rhapsody' in anything! It's just...wasted here, because it's just used as general seasoning for the mood. There's no forward momentum with the song. There's no underlying parallels. This is just superficial correlation, a vague humor that leans almost entirely on association with feel-good visual rhythms from other, more successful action movies. The humor here feels aimless and recycled and that's supposed to be the guiding thrust, what takes you by the hand in the ""story"" of the trailer.The beegees song tied directly to the film last time.. 'Rhapsody' just gets lost in the piled on imagery, which is just easter egg after easter egg of...just ""stuff"". 

The trailer is begging its premise too much. The first teaser was enough for me to be optimistic: now its hard selling all of the choices that made me tentatively invested to begin with. Harley's just being marketed as the generic crazy bitch. Deadshot is the sassy no-nonsense black guy. And joker is just the scuzzy weirdo. All I'm getting is the sense of a film that's dealing with material it simultaneously can't nuance, can't ""update"", and so therefore must apologize for. Like its the comic's fault. 

 But that's my initial reaction, and my secondary reaction, and my tertiary reaction. I want to like this. Maybe it's just a generic trailer, a sub-par cut of the film, and the film will be good. I love the premise of the 'Suicide Squad', so...let's just see what happens. Right now it just feels too cluttered and busy. I'm not getting a general sense of direction yet and the Wild Bunch feel isn't grabbing me. The delivery just doesn't feel right."

CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm torn on Harley, the first quote is stupid as fuck but that last part made me like her a bit more."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody's music video looks like full of SUICIDE SQUAD fans comments now. But thanks to this trailer, more and more people is getting popular with and appreciates one of the most and greatest song of all time."

city of gotham.
gordan turns on bat signal. Batman appears out of nowhere.
Gordon: the joker won. people will lose hope.
Batman: They won't. They must never know what he did.
Commissioner James Gordon: bla bla bla
Batman: But the Joker cannot win. Gotham needs its true villain. 
Commissioner James Gordon: [understanding immediately] No! fuck you no!
Batman: ""You either die villain, or you live long enough to see yourself become the hero."" I can do those things, because I'm not a villian, not like Joker. I killed those people, that's what I can be.
Commissioner James Gordon: No, you can't! You're not!
Batman: I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be. Call it in.
Commissioner James Gordon: They'll hunt him.
Batman: You'll hunt him. You'll condemn him, set the dogs on him. Because that's what needs to happen. Because sometimes…the truth isn't good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. [runs]
Gordon's Son: Batman? Batman! Why is he running, Dad?
Commissioner James Gordon: Because we have to chase the Joker.
Gordon's Son: He didn't do anything wrong.
Commissioner James Gordon: Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him, because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's the joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Of course they had to become heroes
CmRih_VtVAs,lady who plays harley quinn seems to have that character nailed I can't wait to see this

CmRih_VtVAs,"I would walk barefoot through 1000 miles of legos with nothing but Lindsay Lohan's queef as my only air supply, just for the 1 in a million chance to hear Margot Robbie fart through a walkie-talkie."

But Cara tho 😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So why is it Harley is like pretty more than half naked while the boys get clothes lol?! Loved Harley when she first appeared, Batman the Animated series. Jared Leto....looks like Jared Leto. He looks lame to me. Will Smith.....yeah I could personally do with less of him."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm convinced that Margot Robbie is the most beautiful woman on earth
CmRih_VtVAs,2:11 HAHA ilove it! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath Ledger would be proud
CmRih_VtVAs,"Se ve super buena, cuento los días para verla. Y Queen se escucha tan increíble y adecuado para el filme. Será un éxito."

CmRih_VtVAs,CANNOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,For cara
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why do you guys keep comparing this trailer with BvS? The 2 movies are not in competition with each other,  because they're part of the same cinematic universe."
CmRih_VtVAs,is that you Jinx ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope the movie will be 3 hours long or something!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can we just love both dc and marvel for God sake fanboys,the both copy each other,and still their movies are fun to watch."

CmRih_VtVAs,ITS AMAZING THAT THEE FRIENDS OF 16 YEARS OLD ALONE HAVE CREATED A MOVIE..GO ON TO THIS CHANNEL....
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like i can't stop watch this over and over again
CmRih_VtVAs,Princess of the Universe :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't feel like she captured the Harley Quinn vibe. She seems to be playing some random crazy person/villiN
CmRih_VtVAs,i kynda love the part where the guy punches a woman (u_u)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Definitely going to be better than Batman vs Superman, not better than Civil War though"
CmRih_VtVAs,That this soundtrack sang by neverShoutnever?
CmRih_VtVAs,Nothing really matters to meeeeee...(Joker)
CmRih_VtVAs,looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto at 2:00. Too badass.
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,This is genuinely one of the best trailers ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Soundtrack. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE AWESOMME!
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn is already my favorite character in this movie <3 <3
CmRih_VtVAs,waiting
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol I can't believe in 2 days this trailer has the same amount of views as the Batman V Superman one that came out a MONTH ago. Who would of thought when it was first announced..
CmRih_VtVAs,LOL Will Smith as Deadshot?? Thats awesome!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"the thing that bothers me about this trailer is that, since SS is supposed to be tied up to BvS, well this seems like a funny comical movie and BVS looks like the complete opposite. are they just gonna kill Robin in a comical way? but Batman get all the sorrow and dark vibe in the DC extended universe"
CmRih_VtVAs,Man I hope they go dark because I don't want dc cringeworthy jokes
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad crazier than i thought .This is going to be fun to watch.Cant wait .
CmRih_VtVAs,"THIS IS GOING TO BE ""SPARTANS"" EPIC."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG victoria's secret model .. wow

CmRih_VtVAs,the girl looks like jinx from lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Im more excited for this than that bat vs alien piece of shit
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,"FYI, this movie will NEVER EVER happen (WB didn't plan to make it) if not because of David Ayer with his big balls walk into WB office and giving those exec his pitch."
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks so over-the-top, but at the same it looks amazingly brilliant. Either way, it's gonna do well regardless what a few minority negative critics say. Also, the best part in the trailer had to be at 2:06."
CmRih_VtVAs,I tried not to sing.
CmRih_VtVAs,If only Queen(band) alive until now.... Good times
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,I have FAR higher hopes for this movie than I do for Dawn of Justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,So who's the real bad guy?
CmRih_VtVAs,this is epic
CmRih_VtVAs,wow!!! that's EDGY!!1!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The budget for this movie would have solved world hunger.

CmRih_VtVAs,squeeeeel! like a lil girl
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07

Culazoo!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this sir, is how you make a trailer. Managing to hype me up more for this then Batman V Superman. I Loved how they didn't show Batman I mean yeah many people wanted to see Batman and also wanted to see the main Villian (The Joker hopefully playing a big part is not the Villian here) so much so that they would say the trailer was Meh and that they expect more. Well sorry to say sometimes they ask too much. Not showing Batman was smart you teased him in the teaser which was perfect and now we know he is in this movie. Everyone looks fucking great in this film. I didn't see Jared Leto though I saw the Joker yea... No Jared."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Serious props to the editors. This is one of the best trailers I have ever seen. Even if the film sucks, this trailer will go down in history as one of the best."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG CARA AND MARGOT HOLY SHIT I LOVE THEM BOTH I CANT WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,still waiting for batman vs superman ! ... nothing can beat that
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is the funnest trailer (and hopefully movie) i've seen in ages.

looks like Mad Max in the city with super powers"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto will nailed it!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Infinitely more promising than the first teaser.
CmRih_VtVAs,"harley quinn , the best character so far"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:29 best frame ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've noticed something strange. 

When Rick Flagg reads or describes the membes of Suicide Squad, he includes Enchantress. But she's just standing behind him, touching him. Isn't it little bit odd?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"the chick that plays harley is totally talentless. but hey, eyecandy"
CmRih_VtVAs,were are bad guys so what we do wew suicide squad wow amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is gonna be a let down, all the best scenes are shown in this trailer, trust me."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so fucking cringeworthy.
CmRih_VtVAs,where's captain boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY HOLY FICKDBDJDJEK
CmRih_VtVAs,really this song..... it's 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,why does the joker look like Marilyn Manson and why doesn't Harley Quinn have her voice
CmRih_VtVAs,Now we wait for Justice league and god damn Justice League Dark
CmRih_VtVAs,"that girl looks jinx, lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley = girlfriend goals
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is nothing short of brilliant!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 TF2 scout running for intel like..
CmRih_VtVAs,Wtf. Is that Cara Delevigne?
CmRih_VtVAs,"and the Oscar goes to.....


drumroll.....


NOT Will Smith!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"What a bad song , it ruined  the trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks cooler than sharknado
CmRih_VtVAs,my question is: Are they like tasked with the order to kill Doomsday or Joker? this trailer gave off a monster-not-seen-but-felt feel to it for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,I take it back his joker looks really good
CmRih_VtVAs,damn...  joker looks really hot tho
CmRih_VtVAs,I think DEADPOOL's the real worst hero..
CmRih_VtVAs,What's this?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not impressed with the joker! yeah, not even a lil bit."
CmRih_VtVAs,UGH I CAN'T WAITTTT!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn for the WIN
CmRih_VtVAs,"Короч начало нормально, в итоге - хуйня."
CmRih_VtVAs,"People use to say ""DC movies sucks"" then they saw this . Not True, However , DC first started  movies early in the nineties with Donner Superman movies & Tim burton's Batman movies,WW show,etc. Marvel hasn't had anything during that era . 
When i look at Batman V Superman & Suicide squad. They are  looking  up to be really good films  , promising movies for the start of a Cinematic universe.
Sure,they got stinkers in the past, as do FOX/SONY/pre-MCU. Its time WB get DC off their butts and start giving us the fans great CBM in the following  years to come. Can't wait for Wonder woman and Justice League part One Next year! 

Cheers to all the CBM from Marvel/DC cming out this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dc to marvel: ""i cant wait to show you my... toys."""
CmRih_VtVAs,1:19 CUTEST. SCENE. EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith and Margot been in like three movies together so weird 🤔🤔🤔
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie <3 <3
CmRih_VtVAs,hopefully they did not  spoil every thing in the  trailer like what happen to bat man v superman  and jurassic world
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the Sinister Six movie that never happened :(
CmRih_VtVAs,NOPE ! You CANNOT use bohemian rhapsody for your shitty money cow!
CmRih_VtVAs,"how to piss off a DC fan *no offence and sorry for my terrible grammar

where is ultron in this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,This style of trailer reminded me of guardians of the galaxy. Also I thought the CGI work actually looked like it belonged in a 2016 movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks way to good.  My one hope is that Superman makes a cameo as they do mention him.  It would be nice to see him interact with Harley Quinn lol and have Batman come up to him and say ""welcome to my world"""
CmRih_VtVAs,i've just been watching alot of arrow season 2 and there was a epsiode called suicide squad with deadshot and some others in the squad and I think I heard harley quin un the background. is this realated to the movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,"We've seen AMAZING trailers for horrible movies, and we've seen TERRIBLE trailers for EXCELLENT films. DON'T JUDGE MOTHER FUCKERS!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I seem to be the only person here more attracted to Cara rather than Margot .
CmRih_VtVAs,LITERALLY..I  CAN´T STOP WATCHING THIS TRAILER.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's like a music video.
CmRih_VtVAs,i'd slam margot robbie's back door all day.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Have you noticed what's written in the shirts of the store while Harley steals the purse? ""Se vis pacem para bellum"" = if you want peace, prepare the war. lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,andrew mejia. her name is katana.
CmRih_VtVAs,Just got an erection from watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,This Wayne's World remake looks absolutely nothing like the original.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have seen this trailer like 20 times in the last 2 days. No joke. Bohemian Rhapsody makes it epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,and suddenly everyone is the biggest harley quinn fanboy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fuckin best Super Villain Movie Trailer with the best Music, it works so fuckin good"
CmRih_VtVAs,harley is sexy

CmRih_VtVAs,Looks a bit shit
CmRih_VtVAs,joker is their enemy?
CmRih_VtVAs,i ship Harley Quinn and Rick Flag :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"There are 6,300 who need to get over Harley and Joker not being from animated Batman"
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking August
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks cool
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait to buy this movie and watch like thousand times, OMG, my eyeballs, my brain is exploding,Freakin awesome, Crazy charters, fantastic action, insane humor."
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is hot af. Would fap to that all day lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks Awesome!, Wish it was a tv series though instead of a movie, as a series would probably be able to see season 10+ because the content would be endless"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Shit, now Bohemian Rhapsody's stuck in my head."
CmRih_VtVAs,Do you need body piercings in weird places to enjoy this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,The best Joker laugh ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause, rewind...pause, rewind...pause, rewind"
CmRih_VtVAs,good I like very nice
CmRih_VtVAs,its funny how a lot people are arguing on here about which movie will better suicide squad batman v superman civil war deadpool. everyone needed chill out and be grateful any of these movies are actually happening at all I can honestly say I'm excited for each and everyone of these movies 😁
CmRih_VtVAs,did anyone see poison ivy
CmRih_VtVAs,LOOKS LIKE TOTAL SHIT AND THAT BITCH CAN'T ACT
CmRih_VtVAs,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! Screw Batman v Superman, I wanna see Suicide Sqad!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Seriously crazy... Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,The only thing I didn't like was the actor playing Harley her acting made me cringe.
CmRih_VtVAs,subscribe at Jasperrie
CmRih_VtVAs,so who is the enemy actually?
CmRih_VtVAs,Between this and Batman V Superman - not to mention Wonder Woman and Justice League - I almost feel bad for Marvel. Almost.
CmRih_VtVAs,The shots at 1:05 go so perfect with Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this. 
1) I hope Harley has way better lines in the movie that don't make her sound like an idiot. 
2) Can we just pretend this version of Joker never happened? Go away Jared Leto.
3) ""worse heroes ever"" was mega cheesy, and not in a good way.
But the rest looks great."

CmRih_VtVAs,I believe I saw jinx malphite brand and lucian :0
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome - Suicide Style which side.... Suicide!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I just can't stop watching this trailer! Forget Batman vs Superman and Civil War...Deadpool and Suicide Squad are going to be AMAZING!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so fucking awesome!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:13 me waiting school to end
CmRih_VtVAs,Excuse my mandarin but that looks pretty fuckin bad ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"first time ive heard this song, people are like ""whats wrong with you?!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst Movie Ever maby?
CmRih_VtVAs,"But Katana was one of the ""good guys""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anybody know the credits font?
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit! my Wife is here! 0:51 i'm going to bath her now..
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad to me is a more action and mature version of Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,That Joker laugh though!
CmRih_VtVAs,just when you thought Harley Quinn couldnt get any hotter..
CmRih_VtVAs,Plot twist the villain is Groot
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't read the comments
CmRih_VtVAs,@Rhys Marsh you should be crucified
CmRih_VtVAs,"holy shit that was freaking awesome. This is a DC movie I'll be seeing in theaters, not BatmanvSuperman"
CmRih_VtVAs,That was FUCKING awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Remove part of the clip that has DeadShot saying ""Let's go save the world"" and the trailer would be perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly had little interest in this beyond Margot Robbie in short shorts..until now, that is. This looks like it might be kinda awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"291,216  emos . damn were outnumbered"
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is the green goblin. Best villain ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,"movie looks like crap, and i want to beat off to jokers gurl friend."
CmRih_VtVAs,"fucking comics movies shit, when will it stop"
CmRih_VtVAs,Ofcourse the male Aussie is the one to crack open a beer
CmRih_VtVAs,who's the asian with the mask?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Crappy!
People watching this must be either religious or stupid ... or both!"
CmRih_VtVAs,حلو كتير بس بديا كامل
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't even like super heroes (don't hate), but this looks AWESOME."
CmRih_VtVAs,one does not simply introduce a new Joker without the Old jokers consent.
CmRih_VtVAs,They used the perfect song for this trailer! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey.... I'm glad DC is applying a darkly humorous tone that Marvel hasn't done yet. It feels fresh since most Marvel films tend to carry a samey tone (not that I didn't enjoy them)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Song choice: On point.
The rest: .....I'm not sure how i feel. Not impressed nor do I get the impression that they nailed it."
CmRih_VtVAs,The editor for this trailer was a genius.
CmRih_VtVAs,The shit song killed it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is...  is DC trying to ape GotG?  'Cause I really got GotG vibes from this trailer.  Was expecting a gritty Not-The-Heroes-We-Deserve-But-The-Heroes-We-Need theme and instead got Queen and a gag reel.

... Not sure if I'm disappointed or now completely invested."
CmRih_VtVAs,that background music tho lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel that, the original Harley (The one of cartoons and comics) Is way too different of this one. It doesn't has that tender ""innocence"" and cuteness when she calls mr. J pudden, when a part of her makes her help batman and Robin. Even the lil kiss on batman lips with a mix of tender cheeks  and sexy coquettish eyes as well. ""Good bye, Batsie"" Blushed winks and runs. Reminds me of some sort of looney Lolita.  All those smiles, laughs, sometimes sad puppy faces and sweet high voice. 
I'm not shipping this one."
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS . JUST.. THIS. IM ALREADY BEEN HYPED ABOUT DEADPOOL LIKE 4 MONTHS. AND I HAVE TO WAIT 7 MORE MONTHS FOR THIS???
CmRih_VtVAs,"looking forward to it, but now am confused. Is it gonna be light hearted like Guardians or dark and serious like the first trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,still do not like the new look Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"QUEEN made my day, so good sounds with picture"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Analysis: 
- Will smith looking good as always
- Joker looks equally good (maybe a bit worse) then Heath ledger's joker (my opinion)
- Good music which helps represent a theme to the trailer
- On the fence about Harley Quinn 
- Rest of the ""bad guys"" are pretty good in my opinion"
CmRih_VtVAs,everything about harley quin is awesome but her voice its to low pitched
CmRih_VtVAs,I am a bit disappointed they replaced King Shark with Killer Croc. :(
CmRih_VtVAs,"Congratulation Will Smith, you played yourself."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok. I'm ready to re-style my wardrobe into Harlequins style. How Harlequins dress up as lecture eh?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hot Topic: The Movie
CmRih_VtVAs,a legend song blended well with an excellent trailer. cant wait to watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,This is AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one who thinks jokers is a weird version of voldermort
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker is like one of the best fictional characters ever created by human ever. I love all the jokers. Can't wait for this one.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else started head banging besides me when the music kicked in? :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've been listening to Bohemian Rhapsody this last few days, then now it's in the trailer of the movie I've been waiting for months!! Is it coincidence or DESTINY? :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,that david ayer at 0:31?
CmRih_VtVAs,The only way Will Smith got in this in this movie is because of Margot Robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,ииьоо
CmRih_VtVAs,*Suicide Squad - Official Trailer 1 [HD]*
CmRih_VtVAs,dirty dozen revamped
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like if this came out first and instead of the comic con being leaked. The hype would have been better
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie better be rated R and looks like it's gonna be a long movie, can't wait for this amazing movie to come out already"
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who isn't going to ignore how terrible Cara Delevingne's acting is in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"wait until the school year starts again after this movie, and the scene stage is revived once again and the embarrassment for the human race is worse than ever before"
CmRih_VtVAs,wow! theres Carra
CmRih_VtVAs,WoW i want to watch this movie right now!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this Harley and jinx from lol would probably be good friends
CmRih_VtVAs,They fucking ruined some of my favorite comic book characters. pitiful
CmRih_VtVAs,"And the worst joker even will leto! I guess we got the first bad one... had to happen some day.


anyone saying they like this is a clown. he has tattoos. when would he get a grill and tats is he like a confused hipster like using 06 fads. cool undergone on your car bro."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well Well, i never thought i would be looking forward to seeing Suicide Squad much more than Batman V Superman but this trailer just confirms that once and for all,it's interesting but what this trailer has that most of the best trailers ever made have is the element of surprise, there will be a range of brilliant performances, Jai Courtney had me in laughing mode just watching him as  Captain Boomerang 1:36 to 1:38 words i never thought i would ever say, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was brilliant casting Jared Leto looks demented as the joker only weak link seems to be will smith it looks well like every other will smith performance, am sure smith will handle the action sequences very well, but this looks promising and with these views in such a short time it looks like its going to surpass the BvS official trailer 2 very very soon........."
CmRih_VtVAs,Where does he get those wonderful toys…
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn is jinx in a nutshell
CmRih_VtVAs,aguardando esse filme véi...
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:44, Brainiac?"
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the title of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this The Avengers
CmRih_VtVAs,"I still think the Joker looks gay.    For being the Joker anyway.   If it was another character it would probably be awesome but it's not the Joker.   The voice is pretty similar to Heath Ledgers, i wasn't really feeling the laugh and I'll never be ok with the tatttoos and teeth.    Id rather the Joker with his face cut off than this style."
CmRih_VtVAs,По началу показалось что это ремейк на Зеленого Слоника.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want to see this movie and Deadpool, both movies caught my attention, the actress that appears as Harley Quinn makes the character look so beautiful, I think Jared Leto acted very well as the Joker, also, the way they fixed the song Bohemian Rhapsody fits very well, may be weird that that song is on the trailer, but was ok"
CmRih_VtVAs,posion ivy is in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,YES DADDY
CmRih_VtVAs,Tatsu is there😁

CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07,Harley's arse. Giggity Giggity goo"
CmRih_VtVAs,Still can't believe Will Smith is a part of Suicide Squad. One of the best actors is a comic book villain.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 its that acid and joker and harley queen are melting?
CmRih_VtVAs,I really want to call Hollywood bullshit hyping.... but it just looks so much fun!

Suicide Squad: Black and Rainbow"

CmRih_VtVAs,It's good that this movie will have humour. This trailer epitomises wrong with what Batman V Superman looks like it's going to be

CmRih_VtVAs,I just Love harley Quinn Haha..<3

CmRih_VtVAs,Kai Courtney looks good for his role

CmRih_VtVAs,Why......Harley? Your voice is.......RUINED
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just looks shit. Sorry but this craps been done over and over again. All buying into the hype train and it will be fucking crap. 

Harley acting nothing like Harley Quinn. Joker looking nothing like joker. Sorry but the Nolan franchise buries this. It's not even funny how shit this looks."
CmRih_VtVAs,"In case you're wondering, ""Wait (The Whisper Song)"" by Ying Yang Twins is the song."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why in August? Wouldn't it be best showing it in July when everyone isn't worried about going back to school or their colleges? These guys need to think better...
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57-1:60 holy shit the best scene
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wtf people, stop comparing Ledger and Leto, they are completely different styles of joker, just because one thing is not what you wanted it does not mean it is bad. This is a original and modern form of Joker so stop hating on him and see the fucking movie first 
Thank you, holy fuck. "
CmRih_VtVAs,That was one dope trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,0:51 HILARIOUS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer view count is really creepin up on Batman v Superman in just two days, how is that possible?"
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer I have ever seen ..... I can't wait .... joker will be awesome .... 👌👌
CmRih_VtVAs,I get more hyped now
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie just looks depressing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Seeing Leto in the suit firing that machine gun while laughing pretty much sold me on him as the Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 1.56, look at the water reflection ! more scarier than the whole conjuring movie dude."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck yeah finnally dc is doing a good job trailer finally fucking did it dc 👍

CmRih_VtVAs,This Joker reminds me of the one from the animated series. And that guy was out of his mind. Could be great
CmRih_VtVAs,so I have to wait until August? ....
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer wins my heart just by using bohemian rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,i'd actually be genuinely surprised if the role of the Joker didn't mentally affect Leto even a little bit bc he looks absolutely psychotic in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Usually im one for DC movies but this is pure garbage

CmRih_VtVAs,This will murder my harley quinn forever.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry but this kinda ripping off Guardians of the Galaxy, group of misfits that are criminals with 70's music in the background, just seems like I've seen this before and feel like Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be the superior film, just saying my opinion."

CmRih_VtVAs,"If they were gonna put a queen song in this trailer, they should have at least done it right and used ""Don't Try Suicide."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or do all this characters look like ripoffs
CmRih_VtVAs,this honestly looks like allot of fun. for once I'm glad to go see a new DC movie. I'm glad it isn't so dull like nolan dark knight was with its grounded in reality and being a little to searous. still worried about batman vs superman though.

It looks good based on what I've seen, but I also know DC's history with films so I am going to see it when it comes out and I am going to remain cautiously optimistic but I'm not going to hype myself up too much. 

Hopefully this film exceeds my expectations tenfold!"

CmRih_VtVAs,As Super hero fan I make no preference between DC or Marvel. Both Suicide Squad and Deadpool are the top of my watch list right now. Honestly trying to avoid Superman V Batman since I feel DC is rushing it so they can catch up to Marvel and Captain America:Civil War is not pulling me in like Winter Soldier did(especially after Age of Ultron felt like a set up rather then a movie). But regardless its going to a busy year....hopefully despite fighting Ivan Ooze...I mean Apocalypse....X men might actually be good and Superman V Batman will pull it off and we get better DC movies out there in the future.
CmRih_VtVAs,is batman part of this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,"People asking who the actors of some of the characters are: Do you not have IMDB??

People asking why the bad guys are trying to save the world: Do you not have Google or Wikipedia?

CmRih_VtVAs,PEOPLE!!!! ENOUGH!!! It's obviously the theme to The Love Boat by Judge Judy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Loved Harley😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Going back and forth on the whole Leto and Ledger debate. Honestly, can't say much on Leto since I obviously haven't seen the movie yet.. but based on performance only, Ledger was probably the best when it came to bringing the Joker to life. Yes all the previous jokers left their mark and played him to their best understanding of the character... but Ledger took the win. So far. In my opinion each one had their little quirks and individual interpretation of how to proceed and take the role of the joker. So comparison of each Joker is understandable. We all have different opinions, no need to go crazy. I'm just curious to see how Leto portrayed the Joker in this film. Looking forward to it actually. So ""put a smile on that face"" and just enjoy the fact that this movie is real. IT'S HAPPINING"
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn cara is so beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,not excited for the new joker with grills but looking foward to the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,something tells me cara delavigne will be the villain in the movie

CmRih_VtVAs,Is this real life...
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS HOW YOU DO A TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,muito bom esse trailer e sem spoiler ainda bem :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like this Joker :)
I think what people don't realise is when making films based on comics/books, some changes are acceptable based on the type and tone of the film. People complained that Ledger's Joker didn't make enough ""jokes"" or laugh enough or didn't use his ""joker weapons."" But that was cos the Nolan films are meant to be more realistic and have a serious tone. But his Joker was still great, its obviously not the closest to the comics but that was kind of the point and he still was a great Joker for that film.
I like Leto's Joker and have faith he'll do a great job with his character for This film (I'm still not on board with his look, but if he has enough of the Joker ""personality"" and feel then I'm okay with it) especially since Leto is a good actor.
My favourite Jokers are
1. Heath Ledger
2. Mark Hamill
3. Jared Leto

These are just my opinion.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""WORTS JOKER EVER"""
CmRih_VtVAs,can someone tell me if this suicide squad is saving the world or the bad guys?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bet Enchantress is the villain

CmRih_VtVAs,So this is now a Will Smith movie LOL!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"since all the heroes are fighting each other (batman,superman and marvel is having a civil war) they need the bad guys to save the world 😂😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,where is batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally something fun and entertaining from dc movies. I glad they finally stop their mind set of overly dark and brooding character. Sometime I want to see something fun and awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's weird. A few days ago I finally saw Batman: Assault On Arkham, and I thought ""Man, if the movie Suicide Squad is going to be based on that, then I cannot wait to see the movie when it comes out"". But now that I look at this trailer, it doesn't give me that same sense of feeling.

First, when I see the crocodile (or shark?) character, I thought he would be a lot bigger and more buffed. Second, When I saw this version of Harley Quinn, it's not the same that I know of. Third, I don't know about Will Smith being Deadshot, but then again I do not know a lot of his origin/backstory aside from (maybe?) having a little girl that he loves, so I can't say anything about him just yet.

Lastly, can anyone let me know whether what's the name of all the characters and their powers?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it. More excited for this then BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it. More excited for this then BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody makes everything better... :3
CmRih_VtVAs,That guy destroying the train station is probably tattoo man
CmRih_VtVAs,i didn't see Cara Delevingne on the billing..
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well Bohemian Rhapsody can make anything seem better than it is, but this still looks bad. Take out Bohemian Rhapsody and it looks terrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, now let's watch this on repeat until August *cracks knuckles*"
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that this movie comes out the very same week as my upcoming 21st birthday is ALL the better. :) Can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,I approve of harley quinn 😀
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the greatest songs ever murdered by yet another superhero movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I actually really like the comedic bits. I'm sure it will be a serious movie overall, just simply enticing people with a creative (ish) little trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Could that be Tattooed Man in the subway!!?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a movie? For a while I thought this was going to be a show
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is my favourite straight away!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,goodbye everybody I've got to gooo
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing <3
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA
CmRih_VtVAs,"Every bit of bias I had against Jai Courtney was tested when he was cast as Captain Boomerang, and I have to say he is the best part of this trailer. Honestly, he just made me laugh with his eyebrow."
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA
CmRih_VtVAs,DAT ASS 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"For how dark and tormenting this movie will be, an actual on-set therapist with be there to keep the cast calm. IM SO FUCKING EXCITED"
CmRih_VtVAs,"high budget, will smith havin', over hyped, michael bay lookin', bull shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Day 100: still watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks like a funny movie than your average dc movie
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so easy to get likes here
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks like a funny movie more your average dc movie
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks like a funny movie more your average dc movie
CmRih_VtVAs,*cough cough* Scott Eastwood....
CmRih_VtVAs,pff hahaha the song fits perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dawn of justice,civil war and suicide squad this year is a blessed one for superhero fans. Also I hope will smith and jared Leto throw down."
CmRih_VtVAs,love this thing
CmRih_VtVAs,They chose the best song. Now I HAVE to see it!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Badass.RIPMARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,love this thing
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song at the end
CmRih_VtVAs,This is great!!! I want to see it!
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this over and over....
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this. This convinces me more than BVS.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If it was rated R it could be interesting, but since they're aiming for PG-13, they're missing out on a lot of golden opportunities. Joker looks much too tame, and the entire movie sounds like a DC Guardians of the Galaxy. I dunno, I guess we'll all find out in August."
CmRih_VtVAs,"if you HAVE to watch it, then pay for Civil War and hop to this one"
CmRih_VtVAs,whos with me???
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is absolutely awesome. Bohemian Rhapsody is a perfect fit for this trailer. Harley quinn is awesome, funny and sexy. Joker is absolutely brilliant. Everyone needs to quit analyzing every DC and Marvel movie and just enjoy them. All the DC and Marvel movies fucking rock. If you hate them so bad, then don't watch them. Cant wait for this one to come out in theaters"
CmRih_VtVAs,im gonna boycott this movie because of will smith is jealous because Leonardo Dicraprio was nominated for best actor and he wasnt
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can DC fanboys quit making this into a ""vs marvel"" thing? just enjoy both you FUCKIN' VIRGINS."
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW! Just...WOW! 😀
CmRih_VtVAs,at 00:40 who was that guy doing the punching
CmRih_VtVAs,"Captain Boomerang! I am psyched. Most bad ass character. Sometimes a one man wrecking crew, sometimes ducking out and drinking while others fight. Love that psycho. It's be nice to see him beat Flash's ass."
CmRih_VtVAs,i paused the video in the end to see my name
CmRih_VtVAs,Who wants  MoonKinght Movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like a 20th Century Fox adaptation of a Marvel comic. Granted this is just based on the trailer but the characters seem a bit one-dimensional and the casting might not be 100% there.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Who else came here from the Bohiam rapsody song,  where the video features suicide squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even need to see the movie now. This trailer was cool as fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the song used in this
CmRih_VtVAs,August! I can't wait! XD
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have always wanted to see Harley onscreen in a live action movie & with everything they have shown so far, she looks so damn disappointing. Still reserving judgement until I see the movie though"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Film looks like a lot of fun, but God I hate that song! Ugh."
CmRih_VtVAs,"jared leto: ""welcome to my twisted mind""
all of you: ""wWOW BEST JOKER EVER I CANT TELL IF ITS JARED ORR THE JOKER IM SPEAKIGN TO"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"The song is Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. If you didn't know it, get an education asap."
CmRih_VtVAs,I still think Heath Ledger is the greatest Joker of all time after this trailer. Still lit as fuck tho...
CmRih_VtVAs,"i like how harleys neckless says ""puddin"""
CmRih_VtVAs,0:30 really love that music beats followed by the scene's beats...
CmRih_VtVAs,amo la canción de fondo❤🙌
CmRih_VtVAs,amo la canción de fondo❤🙌
CmRih_VtVAs,name of the song is darude sandstorm ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm SO excited. 
Margot Robbie is the perfect cast for Harley Quinn but why the shitty costume? They could have made her look more like Suicide Squad comic version versus slutty cheerleader. More red, less pink. More corset, less tshirt.
I think Jared Leto is going to kick ass, I even like his look except for the tattoos and the purple Lamborghini. Those things seem like something an obsessed fan would have, not the Joker himself."
CmRih_VtVAs,I might like this movie a Bit more than BVS yes I said it this movie and BVS are going to put Dc on top
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no words...can't wait until August!
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no words...can't wait until August!
CmRih_VtVAs,Watching Terminator Genisys had me like 0:17
CmRih_VtVAs,"Producers: David, we need a song for the trailer.
David Ayers: I think we'll go with a little Bohemian Rhapsody gentlemen.
Producers: Good call!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"gotta say, this looks freakin sweet"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is like the best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Not only is Leto doing a Ledger impression. They also shot a scene in an abattoir like Dark Knight. What unoriginal rip-off artist hacks!
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto will never be able to top Heath Ledger. sorry but its true.
CmRih_VtVAs,"have to say, this trailer got me alot more excited for the movie then the last one"
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto will never be able to top Heath Ledger. sorry but its true.
CmRih_VtVAs,my bits is back
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fans: ""Trying to steal from the avengers huh!?""

DC fans: ""Yeah look at all the Marvel fans hatin!""

Me: I'm so fucking tired of super hero movies!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,what if batman v superman is connected to this movie😂?

CmRih_VtVAs,What book was Harley reading
CmRih_VtVAs,Min 1:28 BEST LAUGHT EVER!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Pense que era del creppypasta la concha de la lora
CmRih_VtVAs,That was pretty legit.
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hate the way they over sexualize harley Quinn she's my favorite villain
CmRih_VtVAs,what kinda fucking bullshit is this!
CmRih_VtVAs,what kinda fucking bullshit is this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love DC and i love joker but this new guy looks like he is going to do one shit job as the joker, not because he is a bad actor or whatever he is, but because he isn't made to be joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Three words:

Uh. May. Zing."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still don't see a proper Harley Quinn. Her wicked high pitched/annoying Brooklyn accent is her most iconic trait, but she talks like a regular white girl here! I hope she can pull off the mannerisms correctly, this trailer doesn't show enough"
CmRih_VtVAs,I promise I will watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"interesting that so many ""trending"" videos are basically ads, fuck Jewtube."
CmRih_VtVAs,"People watch a trailer and write reviews like they watched the movie. You don't know how Leto's joker is, you haven't seen the movie yet. He's barely even in the trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,she gots a BONER! 0:08 and a hot ass 2:06 ...... DISCO DUCK woulda been a better song selection!_!_!

CmRih_VtVAs,what the songs
CmRih_VtVAs,what the songs
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like the Michael Bay Ninja Turtles of the DC line-up, minus that actual ninja turtle they're calling Doomsday. My enthusiasm just went from 95 to 12."
CmRih_VtVAs,Im worried that with such a big cast we might get some underdeveloped characters. These characters are pretty interesting and I'd like to see their motivation and where they come from. I hope this won't be The Joker and Harley 's movie with Killer Croc having like 0 lines.

CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me what song is at 0:02 ?  Thank you !
CmRih_VtVAs,"Out of all the comic book adapted movies trailers being released in 2016, the suicide squad is the best out of all them so far."
CmRih_VtVAs,ab
CmRih_VtVAs,a
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm starting to think DC might finally redeem itself after that shitty Man of Steel movie and that god awful Green Lantern movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Their needs to b a movie like this with Harley and poison ivy
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn it Dc... tuggin on my heart strings with Queen and a nice shot of Magot Robbies ass. You win. I'll watch.

CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is abysmal!  I for one will never allow my child to see a movie consisting of a whore for a heroine and convicted murderer and rapists for heroes.  dc should be ashamed of themselves. I slammed the door on my thumb by accident and my nail is starting to come
CmRih_VtVAs,Kinda weird seeing will smith as deathstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,THATS MY JAM!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Sera un Peliculon

CmRih_VtVAs,I may or may not like Harley Quinn in thiz movie cuz she doesn't have the accent. :\
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought this was gonna be like a serious movie not comedic lol
CmRih_VtVAs,You May Be Right by Billy Joel would've been a better choice for the song.
CmRih_VtVAs,finally a dc movie that isnt super dark
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh Margot Robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,subscribe @ THE123 BOSS thanks
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think I've ever been so excited to watch a movie as I am with this movie.

CmRih_VtVAs,why did yall report me please tell me in my newist video
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody was the best way to introduce this trailer 😁😄 so excited!
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN YEAH!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,name of the second song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared leto actually looks pretty decent.

surprised because his reveal was the dumbest thing ever.

Harley quinn looks like she is trying way to hard to be edgy and just comes off as annoying. Tara strong is one of the only people who can do Harley well."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, I haven't seen a trailer this incredible since like the Alien movies. Wow, perfection...epic!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen -- Bohemian Rhapsody really lit this trailer on fire
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody!! Epic Song!!!! I love it!! :v

CmRih_VtVAs,"awesome trailer don't get me wrong, but where the hell's harley's and joker's makeup? I love the new DCEU as much as the next guy, mabey even more, but come on guys... if were gonna do this it has to be done right! n don't give me dat, ""we're good directors it's what we do"" crap,  this generation's too gud to be cocky."

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so fucking jerking off to Harley Quin in the theater! That's not butter on your popcorn lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The most amazing thing about this trailer to me is how many people commenting have never heard ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait to show you my toys (:
CmRih_VtVAs,What was the song called they played during the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sad Will Smith is sad. Anyway, using Darude - Sandstorm, I mean Bohemian Rhapsody in this is a really cheap move. You could make a movie trailer about paint drying exciting using that song. That's not fair."
CmRih_VtVAs,worst heroes ever
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm loving Harley's look and attitude but her lines are terrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,Congratulations to Jai and the rest of the #suicidesquad team for your upcoming release. We wish you huge success. Go! #WorseHerosEver
CmRih_VtVAs,"Leaked trailer was way better this gives me second thoughts 
Definitely Suicides Squad for the next get but put to my parent's music?
as Kanye would say Henh?
Aesthetics Presentation What's the mood?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think this Joker's design is actually quite fitting now that we've seen more of him. They want to give a modernized version of a Joker who's the leader of a gang or something, and has a good sense of fashion and style.

That's why they made him look like a pimp and gave him tats and a cane. Now that we've seen a lot of it, I'm  starting to dig it since it actually makes sense."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen brought me here .
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley better refer  joker as mistah J .im so excited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Every time I watch this I get more hyped, I've seen this at least 30 times"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, no liberal outrage at Deadshot being turned into a black man? That's unexpected..."
CmRih_VtVAs,no capn boomerang :(
CmRih_VtVAs,no capn boomerang :(

CmRih_VtVAs,So far away ;(
CmRih_VtVAs,"A lethal metahuman taskforce; I understand the super-sniper, the reptile mutant, the sword-master, the pyrokinetic, and other powered freaks, but what the hell can Harley do? What was she ever expected to do on life-threatening missions (in a movie or in the comics) without at least a bulletproof suit, let alone no superpowers at all? 

DC enjoys showcasing ""Crazy"" as a superpower unto itself. Anyone else agrees?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hoping for it to be more darker but we will see how it turns out
CmRih_VtVAs,coming from a marvel fanboy i gotta say I'm actually looking foward to seeing this
CmRih_VtVAs,Warner Bros just redeemed itself. Now we can all forget that terrible Batman v Superman trailer :P
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the greatest trailer ever made.
CmRih_VtVAs,THAT...was amazing.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Hollywood propaganda BS makes me cringe... 0:20 ""most dangerous people on the planet"" Just say ""in the US"". Not like you gotta look far"
CmRih_VtVAs,i really want to see the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie looks like she nailed Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a huge Harley fan I have to say based solely on this trailer. Worst Harley ever. ""We're bad guys it's what we do."" Should have been. ""Ohh pretty!"" Followed by breaking glass. The scene with the voices in the head bit... Harley wouldn't do. I get it this ""Harley"" is 100% joker free in origin. But come on read the bad girls of Gotham stuff. Harley and Ivy for joker free material. You'd have a better Harley."
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer makes it look camp.
CmRih_VtVAs,Srsly I spent the whole trailer singing bohemian rapsody instead of watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,I just pissed myself

CmRih_VtVAs,Is that the joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg that was beautiful 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is taking over
CmRih_VtVAs,who needs sex if u have suicide squad movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. This action looks pretty good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Some people may hate leto's joker which is fine but there is no doubt that it's gonna be badass when leto's joker clashes with affleck's batman >:D
CmRih_VtVAs,Seems like DC's attempt at a Guardians of the Galaxy. Only far less enjoyable it seems.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ooooohhh mmmmyyyyyy table!! hahahahha Amazing!!! im crazy for see!!

CmRih_VtVAs,"fuck,,august.....!!! this is why i hate trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,another settlement needs your help
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone notice when Harley broke the glass at 2:04 it looked like it scared the shit out of Waylon (Killer Croc)
CmRih_VtVAs,What!?!?? That little bitch I will smith is in this movie!?!? No Oscar for you!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Owwwwwww bang bang
CmRih_VtVAs,Great trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,that jumps feels awkward
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so attractive
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who tought Harley is played by Cara Delevigne
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a theory i believe joker is the bad guy since hes never seen with the squad and at the end i think Harley and joker's relationship will  start after he seduces/tricks her
CmRih_VtVAs,Gets better every time!
CmRih_VtVAs,I just love Harley Quinn in this
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't know this was going to be a comedy. I wonder if there will be a laugh track.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker really needs a dentist.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks good .for some reason I'm still extremely disappointed in the way they are doing Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,And the award for best trailer goes to ..
CmRih_VtVAs,they should do a movie like this for the sinister six from marvel and you guys are gonna be like no but to me that would be awesome and they should add venom and carnage too and imagine them... that would kinda scary and not the venom version of spiderman 3 but a scarier version  and imagine carnage...

CmRih_VtVAs,"Huh, Toronto pulls off the ""wasteland of chaos and violence"" look surprisingly well."
CmRih_VtVAs,"WB srsly? This doesn't seem like a dark movie at all. Looks more loke Marvel shit. New Joker? ridiculous ! And the tattos are ridiculous as well. This movie was supposed to be DARK! Mafia,Gheto,Heists and instead of that you made a funny,shitty,boring film. Its not our yet but by judging the trailer it looks like Avengers. Pffff you had a chance to make this movie dark!

CmRih_VtVAs,Omg after i saw trailer i listened to Queen x3 both of my favorite things in one video <3
CmRih_VtVAs,test
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath ledgers joker is really starting to get overrated just bcuz he died. What bcuz Heath died that there can't be another role for joker? gtfo with that nonsense. Heath performance was awesome but I rather see a joker way closer to the comics. Jared letos joker is definitely closer to the comics. I gotta feeling everybody is gonna love Letos joker watch just you watch﻿. Oh yea and ppl seem to forget about Mark hamill joker. To me he was the greatest joker of all time even if it was just voice acting. But his character was perfect. Mark hamill covered everything what The Joker is supposed to be. If somehow in the future we can have an actor that can bring Mark hamill's Joker from the animated series to life on the big screen then hands down that would be the greatest joker of all time﻿. Please God let me live to see that day. 
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm honestly into the joker and his gang having ridiculous, blinged out costumes. the nice suit, jewelry, and sports cars could simply just be him mocking the material shit people value. cause with him, everything is one big joke! but overall it just looks like fun to me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lets go save the world ""NO NO NO NO NO NO NO"", am I the only one who caught that then died"
CmRih_VtVAs,ledger is the superior joker.its a shame he died.he would have been greatest actor generation.leto is good but ledger has more talent in his one finger than leto has in whole hand.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm freaking thrilled for Batman v Superman, but I'm seriously more excited for Suicide Squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm freaking thrilled for Batman v Superman, but I'm seriously more excited for Suicide Squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,ok but does the joker and harley die because you can clearly see the jokers flesh while his in the acid pool.......

CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly don't know how people can compare Joker's. Look at all the people who have portrayed joker: Mark Hammill, Troy Baker, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, and even Leto. Each one of them have a different way of playing the Joker that is unique to them and them only. That's what's great about the Joker! It's like snowflakes. No two are the same, but thats what makes them great."
CmRih_VtVAs,seriously=)) Harley break the glass just to hack a hand bag man?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn reminds me of Juzuu or whatever his name is from Tokyo ghoul

CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like these trailers are so different, this one is like if Harley Quinn or joker directed it, song, bright logos, all the jazz, but the teaser trailer was like maybe from one of the more solution members like deadshot, all dark and kind of scary."
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome

CmRih_VtVAs,This is like DC's version of Guardians of the Galaxy. Looks great.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see a lot of comments about this is ""better than Batman V Superman"", or ""better than Civil War"". Cool opinions . But I hope everyone realizes there is NO COMPETITION between these two films BvS and Suicide Squad. Also there is no need to feud over marvel and DC every second.  So I hope everyone can just be excited about getting all these epic comic book movies, this is not a time to be negative, it's the time to be excited!"

CmRih_VtVAs,I like how they released one trailer that showed how serious and dark it is and then they give us this one that reminds us of the teams somewhat dual  personality and that they aren't as serious as Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,SOOOOO much better than Batman v sUPERMAN!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,who's that at 1:53
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker's laugh reminded me of the Mad Pierrot from Cowboy Bebop. Awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything seems great but the costumes man. Like Leto sounds incredible but looks ridiculous.
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I like both DC and Marvel and what this trailer gives me is kind of a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe and that was awesome. Hopefully Suicide Squad is better because the characters(villains) in it are much more interesting.
CmRih_VtVAs,This song is perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks pretty cool!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I find it shocking how easily the commenters here are swayed by this generic Hollywood trailer. It's full of dumb predictable jokes (seriously, those are the best jokes they could find to put in the trailer?) and does nothing except cram in as many famous characters for the sake of brand recognition. 

Perhaps the most soulless thing about it is the million different outfits the Joker wears. The only reason that's there is so they can have a bigger toy line."

CmRih_VtVAs,"never seen will smith do a ""bad guy"" role. even though from the trailer it looks more like a half assed bad guy. cant wait to see how it turns out. but boy do i hate jokers look, it just seems like his trying to appease to the hot topic crowd. well again i hope his performance is great atleast"
CmRih_VtVAs,"My only criticism of this trailer is Harley Quinn's last line.  It was already established that these were ""the worst of the worst"", they didn't have to drill that in the audience's head again.  It would have been funnier if she would have done anything different: brushed Flagg's comment aside with a shrug, said out loud ""what?"", or any other quip....""We're bad guys it's what we do""...just a weak line."
CmRih_VtVAs,So I take it they took Batman out of this adaption altogether?

CmRih_VtVAs,"If this was the Trojan War then DC has found Marvel's heel.  The biggest flaw in the MCU are the not so memorable villain's.  Think back across all the Marvel movies and I challenge anyone to name all the ""bad guys"" - they are not relatable, engaging and are easily forgotten.  This is a brilliant way to setup the DC universe, a simple yet smart approach to building a universe and challenging Marvel's cinematic dominance.   And they have Margot's ass.... (2:13)   :) :) :)"

CmRih_VtVAs,Leto looks absolutely fucked up... i love it!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was very disappointed with the Comic Con trailer. It took itself way too seriously. I thought the Suicide Squad should be summed up by the music ""In the Hall of the Mountain King."" Needless to say, I could not be happier with this trailer. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is so freakin perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith ????? HELL NO !!!!!!! DISLIKE IT ALLREADY

CmRih_VtVAs,I watched like 5 times now and not bored of it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Three things:

1. This certainly seems to be attempting to be the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" for the DC Cinematic Universe or whatever the fuck they're calling it.

2. If this is any indication, Leto and Robbie are going to walk away with the movie.

3. Holy shit, is Jai Courtney actually showing some emotion?  Talk about miracles!"

CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody makes this about 120% better, remove it and you have just another ready-made trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I liked everything but Joker and Harley. They just seem too unnecessarily edgy. And where's Harley's Jersey accent? I've heard Robbie's done that before, why not here?"

CmRih_VtVAs,Thanks to SJW I now don't know if there's so many black people because of artistic expression or because of SJW bullying. I know the result is the same but I only agree with it if the director explicitly wanted to do it this way.
CmRih_VtVAs,"shot in my home town, actually saw them filming the scene at 2:04 lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like the most expensive pop culture gag I am old enough to witness and comment on. Clerks (DC COMICS) here we go... Enjoy the cash roll from these unfortunates, it won't last too long..."

CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is my favourite part of this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I guess I'm the only one here who thinks this trailer freaking *SUCKS*! Did I just watch a music video or an actual trailer? I'm so confused, this ""suicide squad"" doesn't seem seem maniacal or even psycho, muchless ""violent.""  What happened with the whole nutjob Joker-loving-mayhem-and-toying-with-Batman's-mind storyline?
AND JOKER! OH MY GOSH, HE FRAPPING LOOKS LIKE MILEY CYRUS! I . . . can't . . . take . . . him . . . seriously . . ."

CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate people who say they don't like people who reply to their own comments, but then they do it themselves."

CmRih_VtVAs,Without bohemian rapsody this wouldnt be that great.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this isn't those kinds of movies that the trailer is awesome but the movie is bad
CmRih_VtVAs,Insane but funny trailer which reminds me when does deathstroke come in task force x.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks exciting... Let's just hope that Will Smith raised his standards after After Earth and Jared Leto doesn't fuck anything up. I think Margot Robbie was a really good choice for Harley Quinn though.

CmRih_VtVAs,I can't get enough of this trailer. Bohemian Rhapsody goes so well with it to show all the awesomeness and insanity of this movie. I have so much high hopes for the DC Extended Universe. 😀😎
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh this looks bad ass!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,"0:08 Harley is fancy as hell. Seriously though I have never seen a cast reflect the comic so absolutely perfectly. CANT WAIT! ""what was that? I should kill everyone and escape?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Song is the only good thing about the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT I CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 - 2:08 😵😍

CmRih_VtVAs,"Not a fan of Leto-Joker just yet, but the rest of the trailer is phenomenal."
CmRih_VtVAs,im too obsessed with Harley Quinnhehehe....
CmRih_VtVAs,YAY no batfleck in this trailer. we don't batfleck in this film anyway.  the best part of the trailer is when harley quin bends over showing signs that shes nuts because she want deadshots nuts. for those who disagree Come at me bro!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, I'm only here because of Cara, will smith and of course the one and only JARED LETO :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,WHEN JOKER PULLS HARLEY FROM THE TOXIC WASTE - THE PINK AND BLUE DYE IN THE ACID FORMS A LITTLE HEART AROUND THEM!! <3<3
CmRih_VtVAs,0:54 Holy shit that's Clint Eastwood's son!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith chose this over Independence Day 2? God damn. I'm in.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""for MEEEE"". *anticipate guitar solo to jam to* .... well that's disappointing.... THERE WE GO!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""for MEEEE"". *anticipate guitar solo to jam to* .... well that's disappointing.... THERE WE GO!"

CmRih_VtVAs,Nah i preffered Heath Ledger's joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've never read the comics for these, so I don't understand why Harley Quinn, the jokers girlfriend, is now suddenly trying to get rid of him? And didn't batman create thus bundle of super heroes?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is that my soul mate Emilie Autumn as Harley Quinn!? I'm not that good at recognizing faces, but she has that heart on her cheek! I'm so proud to see her getting a role in a big commercialized movie like this!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith plays himself in every movie. He adds an accent every now and then but it's still Will Smith. Sam Jackson should get an Oscar before Will Smith does.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This fresh joker seems great, i dont know what all are complaining about. All previous 3 Jokers (Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Hamill) are different and so far has fitted their universe nicely, i have little doubt that this will be any different. Stop wanting the same Joker over and over again and enjoy the fresh adaptations of one of DC's most powerful characters."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevingne has the best eyebrows
CmRih_VtVAs,Music name please!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else watch this like 5 times in a row?

CmRih_VtVAs,Boring!
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Deadpool keeps his mask on for more than a few minutes...not trying to be racist or anything :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm guessing it's Aug 2016 for american cinemas right ? When is it coming out for London????

CmRih_VtVAs,when Jared was smiling with his grills all glistening he reminded me of the Penguin from that Batman movie (can't rmr name)
CmRih_VtVAs,"A brilliant song for a really awful movie, what a wonderful antithesis.. No, i am not trolling, i mean has anyone noticed the indifferent story of this movie and the the bad actors? And one horrible, terrible joker? Who can't even laugh and is not really threatening?!"

CmRih_VtVAs,Watching this gave me goosebumps. Can't wait to see this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wasn't a huge fan of this trailer at first, that being said the more you watch it the better it gets. The scene with the Joker lying with all his weapons is 100% new 52 crazy ass Joker. Not to mention fucking Batman will be in it I'm sure to beat his ass a bit....awesome!"

CmRih_VtVAs,Is it bad if I found Harley to be some kind of adorable?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really don't know why the casted Cara in the movie?? I get it, she's popular, but I would have casted someone else. So many actors and actresses with out jobs, and they are casting celebrities with no acting experiences."
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone tell what song their using for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait someone tell me are they good or bad ? Cuz they said let go save the world

CmRih_VtVAs,This has now become my most anticipated movie of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like how bits of the movie are matched sonically with the song. The guns shooting, the bullets dropping, Harley's  ""Wow!"" and then the random cut of Deadshot punching his makeshift punching bag in his cell.

This is a fantastic trailer."

CmRih_VtVAs,Jodidamente brillante.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still not sold on Jared Leto as Joker.  I guess he looks more like the cartoon version, but I'm still spoiled from the late Heath Ledger's amazing performance."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is the wrong guy for Deadshot. Don't know why they cast him for that role. 

He's bloody making Deadshot look like a good guy. The one from Arrow looks more badass and a bad guy than him."
CmRih_VtVAs,Still think this joker looks more like a henchman rather then the man himself.
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song???
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is the wrong guy for Deadshot. Don't know why they cast him for that role.

CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will be a movie I want because u know team gun fights I LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is the wrong guy for Deadshot. Don't know why they cast him for that role.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is everyone going insane over the fact this might be PG-13. Clearly this would be better Rated R. That's what I want. But is it that needed? The producers haven't talked about the rating as much, of course they want a box office hit, but I feel they made the film they wanted to make. Same happened with Deadpool. But that's a different subject, because Deadpool NEEDED to be Rated R in my opinion. But this... I feel like it will succeed either way and if you're a fan of Suicide Squad, don't be petty and judge so quickly. Does it need straight up graphic blood and guts and over two F bombs to be a weekly executed film? Anyways I'm excited, but I feel they're aiming towards a PG-13 right now. And I think at this point I don't give a fuck."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys.""
I can't wait to see you rock this performance, Jared Leto!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks terrible.  Clever marketing, using a good song to send the subliminal message to people ""I like this""."
CmRih_VtVAs,A Deadpool and Harley Quinn team up would be amazing. And yes I know that Deadpool is a parody of Deathstroke who is also part of the suicide squad (comics)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 Brainiac?

CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith=Good film!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am so excited for this movie. I hope it lives up to its hype.
Its popular nowadays to make a good trailer, rather than a good movie, so people can buy their tickets and regret it only after they see the movie.
Dont Let Us Down DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,will margot get nude for this movie..
CmRih_VtVAs,This whole movie's so edgy I think I got a papercut by clicking on the thumbnail with my mouse
CmRih_VtVAs,letos joker will be pretty dope

CmRih_VtVAs,"Using Queen in a trailer is cheat mode, but still looks pretty damn good."
CmRih_VtVAs,ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,looks neat
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm guessing marvel fans are gonna be changing their pants soon

CmRih_VtVAs,1:19 Gif plx
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks good, but without Queen (or just mute the video) this movie looks horrendously edgy. I believe this movie will be horrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,Nothing beats the Cartoon/Arkham Harley :)
CmRih_VtVAs,come to my channel for free intros just sub
CmRih_VtVAs,"im still bugged by Joker's tats... i mean he's got a suit finally, an dim not a stickler about comic movies. But it still feels odd he HAS to have them. other than that the only thing im still cautious about is the movie actually turning out this good.

Because man of steel had a good trailer too.... and it  was better than the movie. (though i do hope this WILL be good.)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Might as well call this ""Harley Quinn and some others."" She's what everyone is coming to the movie for. I can even deal with the hair being completely wrong.

And can't wait for the fan edit that gets rid of The Joker. He is absolutely horrible. Not sure what the hell was wrong with whoever designed him here."

Once upon a time there was a fish named Whale. Whale hated being a fish, and had always wanted to be a whale. So Whale tried very hard to look and act like a whale. Unfortunately, everyone still saw Whale as a fish. This made Whale very upset, so it committed suicide. The end."

CmRih_VtVAs,I like how they didn't make everything so serious in this trailer I have a feeling this gonna top batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow instantly hate Wil Smith as Deadshot.  Sure its just clip shots but man they must have chosen some bad ones considering he is probably making as much as entire rest of cast.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone is looking at the Leto's Joker and trying to compare to Ledger's Joker and others.  But through this trailer and previous clips, it really seems to me that the performance of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is going to be the show stealer.  Her portrayal of Quinn just in these clips is amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else notice DeadShot was Black? Go check out Arrow or the comics for what he really looks like.
CmRih_VtVAs,Reminds me of the GotG trailers  Whoever edited this trailer is amazing 1:28 - 1:38 is my favorite part  >.< I can't freaking wait!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously this is a film for women. It focuses on Harley leaving the other characters completely unnoticeable. So you ether watching it for the actors like a play ( in this case Will Smith ) or your really into the remakes. 

Again no chronological order of events, just some teen film to pull in dollars. My advice to parents is just to put on ignore. If this was Batman Beyond Joker ( the gang person ) I would understand but it is not. It is just a cheap shot at peoples wallets. 

Seriously it is a girls film, not for dudes"

CmRih_VtVAs,"фик знает,я знаю ток русс язык"
CmRih_VtVAs,LAME!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"why would i dislike either dc or marvel? both are great and both make things not as great.
but this one is really epic!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""it's what we do"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn seems really off :( Attack on Arkham way better. I hope this isn't total fail tho...
CmRih_VtVAs,I miss the Harley Quinn voice now but still excited for this
CmRih_VtVAs,No
CmRih_VtVAs,any movie can look good if the trailer has bohemian rhapsody in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,any movie can look good if the trailer has bohemian rhapsody in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,any movie can look good if the trailer has bohemian rhapsody in it...
CmRih_VtVAs,I need to see this more than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer looks pretty cool, seems like the movie isn't an edge lord fest like the previous trailers made it out to be it actually has some humor. I have a LITTLE more faith restored in this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,Killer croc should've been CGI.   Just saying
CmRih_VtVAs,"Only problem I have is that the Joker doesn't quite look the psychopathic clown in this movie. He's caught baby-face syndrome from Kylo Ren, I think. Looks more like a rich kid who wanted to try being scene."
CmRih_VtVAs,the shot of joker jumping into that thing is legendary
CmRih_VtVAs,the shot of joker jumping into that thing is legandary
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my goodness
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,oh dear God
CmRih_VtVAs,they should put a story to diablo
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Trailer is not a trailer, 'tis Art."
CmRih_VtVAs,they should put a story to diablio
CmRih_VtVAs,I love QUEEN! But the music does not go with the theme of the film...
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love marvel, but the avengers has met their match. I still think batman vs superman sucks though"
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever. so hyped.  bohemian  rhapsody was such a prfect choice
CmRih_VtVAs,The movie looks funny. I like serious concepts with good humour. Might see it when I get the chance
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this so much
CmRih_VtVAs,no sharks eh???? ....oh well
CmRih_VtVAs,So wanna watch that
CmRih_VtVAs,Still not sure what to make of Harrlys costume
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm the only one that really love Jared Leto playing The Joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,lovably crazy and whoo look at the views. Definite good contribution from me :)
CmRih_VtVAs,I've been waiting for this since the year began :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a DC nerd, sort of, i want to say...
Never seen Enchantress and thay Pyro guy...
Did they died...? Or they're new?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a DC nerd, sort of, i want to say...
Never seen Enchantress and thay Pyro guy...
Did they died...? Or they're new?"
CmRih_VtVAs,And they said everything DC served was dark :D
CmRih_VtVAs,For some reason this movie gives me the same vibes that i got from guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,What a poooo..
CmRih_VtVAs,What a poooo..
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling that if this movie and bvs isn't good then it's over for Snyder
CmRih_VtVAs,This shit looks ASS!!!!!! FUCK THIS CORNY SHIT!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What a poo..
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone else feel like Jared Leto is copying Heath Ledger ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"killer croc's grown on me, just a normal guy with crocodile skin and sharp as hell teeth, no tails or 10 foot height"
CmRih_VtVAs,*breathes heavily*
CmRih_VtVAs,Zapowiada się ciekawie :D
CmRih_VtVAs,From what I've seen I like this Joker better than Heath Ledger's Joker. Don't get me wrong his version was very intimidating and a great  bad guy but he didn't feel like the Joker. But from what I've seen this joker feels both intimidating and reminiscent of the 90's Batman animated series Joker. I was worried when I saw that shirtless picture but seeing how he acts and seeing him in that crazy suit and bowtie has put me at ease I am now looking forward to this movie. But then again this is just one trailer I could be wrong

CmRih_VtVAs,the joker of Jared Leto is amazing

CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like a perfect representation of the comic. Like the only thing that would make this more perfect would be if they used king shark instead of croc
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,if the suicide squad turns out to be hero's and not true villains as they are portrayed in the animation I'll be disappointed...like 1% disappointed because this movie looks awesome

CmRih_VtVAs,"i wasn't happy when they choose jared leto for the part but now i'm thinking he might pull it off not we should accept that no actor will ever do what Heath Ledger did 
i loved Harley Quinn she is my favorite female comic character and i've been waiting to see her in a movie for a long time"
CmRih_VtVAs,harley classic outfit pleaseeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE XD
CmRih_VtVAs,The queen song ruined the trailer for me
CmRih_VtVAs,wut no ironman in the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,wut no ironman in the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish the Joker has no tattoos.
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE THIS SONG !!! Somebody tell me the name of this song and the artist ?

CmRih_VtVAs,"2 Best Trailers in my opinion:
Deadpool Red Band Trailer #1
This"
CmRih_VtVAs,nossa vai ser fodah
CmRih_VtVAs,🔥🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,I like when he says mamamia mamamia 1:22
CmRih_VtVAs,"i'm really afraid that people will start to relate queen to suicide squad... nothing against suicide squad but it's annoying when you love a song and they relate it to something you don't care that much but you know will cause a lot of attention.
now oddly enough... this trailer isn't that great, i liked the one of batman V superman (the only thing i could criticizes from the first trailer is that it give away to many things of the plot, but was really fun) this one.... the acting is not great, specially harley quinn where seems like she is just acting like a stereotypical crazy girl (one of the EASIEST roles to play as in any movie) instead of harley quinn from the comics, the affects are decent i guess, the dialoge is not that great, i'm not a fan of these character designs for the movies, it looks like they will change too many things from the comics and frankly... even when it looks entertaining and does a fine job as a trailer... does not seem like the big deal, it's generic."
CmRih_VtVAs,this is sooooo amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,this is sooooo amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,This soundtrack is awesome :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I've watched this about 20 times already! Forget Batman V Superman for the time being! This is the DC movie I'm pumped for!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is on point!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What do you think happened at 1:59?
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else think this movie isn't going to be great? idk why but it just doesn't appeal to me

CmRih_VtVAs,cl
CmRih_VtVAs,Fodaaaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,"k it looks aesthetically pleasing, besides making joker steal lil Wayne's teeth. the actress of Harley could have easily done an accent in her role that is high pitched a bit like in Wolf of wall street. they should have went with a comic look, instead she looks like a crack whore"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is Will Smith in this film? Deadshot isn't black, and even if the producers insisted on a black person playing him they should have picked anyone other than Will Smith."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck Jai Courtney
CmRih_VtVAs,marvel is dead
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel going get buttfucked

CmRih_VtVAs,This one has Bohemian Rhapsody (sorry if spelled wrong) and the last one had The Joke Was On Me. Even the music is perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,3 times and its still swolen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone's fighting in the comments over which is better, DC or Marvel. BUT LIKE SRSLY, I'm glad we have both. More heroes, more villains, more stories."
CmRih_VtVAs,"its crazy how when i first watched this it had 20,000 views, now its 16 million"
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY IS FUCKING BAE
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY IS FUCKING BAE
CmRih_VtVAs,did someone else noticed  Groot there in the trailer??
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so far away :(

I can't wait to see Jai Courtney in this movie..."
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so far away 😥
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so far away 😥

CmRih_VtVAs,intenta copiarle a marvel con lo de las canciones en la pelicula y hacer graciosa....
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Harley Quinn and The Joker"" more like😂😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel = DC

I love both sides!

Can I get an Amen?"
CmRih_VtVAs,i was going  to see it but Will baby Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fell of after Iron Man if you ask me. Aside from X-men and Deadpool the marvel movies are too ""family"" oriented."
CmRih_VtVAs,i was going  to see it but Will baby Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,i was going  to see it but Will baby Smith  in it
CmRih_VtVAs,i was going  to see it but Will baby Smith  in it

CmRih_VtVAs,Best comic book trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Best comic book trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks fucking cheesy. Plus all the characters seem more annoying than they do funny
CmRih_VtVAs,Only me noticed the ink dissolving in the acid has the shape of a heart at 1:58?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish margot robbie had the same accent as she did in wolf of wall street. Would've been perfect for harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow Amanda Waller lost some weight from comics to animation to movie. Good for her!
CmRih_VtVAs,You know it's gonna be a solid movie when they pull out Queen for the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Just remember we all saw the actress for Harley Quinn NAKED in the wolf of wallstreet XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"""the voices"" oh please, harley is not just a random crazy, her craziness is very specific, and is not that"
CmRih_VtVAs,the song is very very amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg
CmRih_VtVAs,.....Well I'm sold
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,So.... who exactly are the good guys here?
CmRih_VtVAs,So.... who exactly are the good guys here?
CmRih_VtVAs,"That part where Joker leaps into acid or something with that Bohemian Rhapsody at the back,

that's so perfect, that it hurt me really, really, bad!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well Zamm! This trailer makes me want to drive freaking fast 😆😆
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 thats common who's suppose to be playing the tattoo man
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's spiderman?
CmRih_VtVAs,So..... its basically borderlands?
CmRih_VtVAs,"why i will watch this film:
1. leto looks amazing as joker
2. i love harley quinn as a character 
3. cara delevigne"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, this looks like it's going to be fun!"
CmRih_VtVAs,ugh at first i was like not another comic book movie - but this actually looks interesting for a change
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the only DC movie I am excited for, screw BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is gonna be a mess. Harley Quinn with no signature accent is something that annoys me, but I can deal with it. But c'mon, Joker just looks like a stupid mix between Marilyn Manson and a white lil Wayne, and that Killer Croc looks so cheap, like the guy's face swelled up or something. And idk, I don't think Will Smith was the right pick for Deadshot. Now Idris Elba, that would've been great."
CmRih_VtVAs,Only seeing bc of cara delevigne
CmRih_VtVAs,they chose the perfect Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,can somebody tell me why the FUCK am i getting goosebumps??
CmRih_VtVAs,1:19. I'm loving this joker already
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm picky about my Harley's but I'm still open to see new ideas, I like the Joker much more in this trailer than the last. And hmm was that acid they were in? I am on the edge of my seat looking forward to find out."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was sceptical at first

Then I saw this trailer

Now I can't wait"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm calling it now, the movie will suck."
CmRih_VtVAs,Одни ебанутые твари
CmRih_VtVAs,I see Harley and I see joker but I do not know anyone else in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,"what, jai Courtney looks good in a movie. he looks like he has personality"
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my fucking god this looks sooo great. Do not disappoint us Ayer!
CmRih_VtVAs,💚 aguarda
CmRih_VtVAs,"this will sell because ""ooo will smith! oo the joker is in a movie! & explosions! k*"
CmRih_VtVAs,💚 aguarda
CmRih_VtVAs,💚
CmRih_VtVAs,Im just falling in love with that woman 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,can u imagine if Keanu play this instead of Will?? looks like destiny finally explains its reason
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SOOOOO LOOKING FORWARD^^
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic rocksteady game incoming
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks great.  

I'm also loving the hate from people who were expecting a ""Darker"" movie.  Fuuuuuuck that.  When people dress up in costumes to beat people up, I want it to be goofy because it IS goofy."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it ok that I already love this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it normal that I already love this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it normal that I already love this movie?

CmRih_VtVAs,"The lines are shit, Amanda Waller looks fucking embarrassing. But this trailer is amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just realized I had this trailer open in two tabs. Now, to watch it for the 13th time."
CmRih_VtVAs,yawp...still not too confident about this
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like we will be seeing a lot more Jared Leto than people expected!
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah!! Bohemian Rhapsody of Queen!!! 💜💜 Chulada 😍👌
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah!! Bohemian Rhapsody of Queen!!! 💜💜 Chulada 😍👌
CmRih_VtVAs,AND THAT. IS HOW YOU EDIT A TRAILER.
CmRih_VtVAs,real music...made that trailer. does anyone else realize that NOTHING on mtv today will be used 35years from now and sound that fucking awesome! no...they'll just have to use the 65 year old song again...this new generation sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,I better not be rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,dc has a shared universe now its our time now dc films is taking over 4 life
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel who ? Batman v superman dawn of justice suicide squad wonder women justice league marvel is Dust in the wind
CmRih_VtVAs,Only thing I still don't like is Ghetto joker still seems to young to me. Apart from that looks good.
CmRih_VtVAs,1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000x more exited for this than Star Wars!

CmRih_VtVAs,This just looks freaKING FUCKING GOOD!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks dumb imo
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker... what happened?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know a lot of people will pe pointing their pitchforks at me. But man, despite that ugly ass joker (which probably will be fun to watch) this movie appears to me more interesting than BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,"What happened to the old, cool music and feel from the last trailer?"
CmRih_VtVAs,BvS can suck it. This looks much better.
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly this movie looks like it will make more money than Batman Vs. Superman. Sidenote: Batman will win. or the fight will just be interrupted so they can work together and form the Justice League. I mean Dawn of Justice.... what else can that mean?
CmRih_VtVAs,"joker fucked up

Honestly though, Harley Quinn is an amazing character, and it's so dissapointing to see her reduced to your stereotypical ""scary evil mentally ill person"" trope, especially considering the ""It was the voices"" line. Groooooss. Get outta here."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, fuck Batman v Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,will this universe  (batman v superman and SS) be conmected in any way to nolans trilogy? I think there is a BIG surprise waiting.
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck me up. one second and fucking QUEEN. don't even need to watch the rest of it to know it's gonna be awesome

CmRih_VtVAs,i smell fan boy fights
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so god damn hyped for this movie... It looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"I find it funny that some people are complaining that this trailer is disappointing because the song isn't depressing like the last one....Have they actually read the damn lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody? It's depressing as fuck, but an awesome rock anthem, and it fits well because some of these so called ""Heros"" have a death wish, so it fits very well. Plus, we haven't seen the dark stuff at this moment, and that will be in the movie when the backstories happen, and I don't think their will be any humor with them at all. Regardless, nerds being nerds, they will end up seeing the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song?!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate the tagline, Justice Has A Bad Side is much better"
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know what, I don't care what people say about this movie , the trailer does it to me , and who Dafuq wanted Willy Fucking  Smith to play a superheroe and it looks to be turned out well!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks interesting can't wait to see this. Jared Leto, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are in the movie so it can't be bad. It can be great or amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cotdamn!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC steals the movies this year, sorry marvel. they will also steal again next year with the justice league. sorry marvel but this is the time to give up."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah... where is Batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like it is going to be an action packed movie!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck off Poohemian Crapsodomy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can you crop the pants of all of the members to the length of Harley's shorts? Please? Because we women want to see some hot man-ass, you know."

CmRih_VtVAs,that very strange moment when you forgive then lack of Harleys accent because this looks better than Dawn of Justice. Way better
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay this whole trailer i was convinced that jai courtney was tom hardy.
CmRih_VtVAs,WHO ELSE IS ONLY EXCITED CUZ OF JAI!!!????

CmRih_VtVAs,Algum br ???
CmRih_VtVAs,Hmmm i know lets take a gang of lesser known characters and make a comedic movie based on their exploits maybe throw a bit of pop music into the trailer and what do we have? Guardians of the gala- oh for fuck sake
CmRih_VtVAs,As soon as I saw this 1:22 I know he will be perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be one hell of a mad movie and I love it
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks a little like a Michael Bay film. Opps it isn't Meagan Fox doesn't play Harley.   
CmRih_VtVAs,What singel in the end
CmRih_VtVAs,"Where are you, Heath Ledger? :C"
CmRih_VtVAs,worst erection i've never had

CmRih_VtVAs,"The shape of the joker's face is correct, along with expression. as for the makeup. I was disappointed at first, but seeing this is more of an origin, I guess I can accept it."

CmRih_VtVAs,I cannot describe how hyped I am for this film
CmRih_VtVAs,I wept
CmRih_VtVAs,now we just have to sit and wait more six months to another trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks bats**t f**king insane. I LOVE IT!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did anyone noticed that Harley is just like Jinx??
Same kind of madness, same voice, same acting, she could definetely be a LOL's skin if she were given a shark cannon!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks bats**t f**king insane. I LOVE IT!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Much like Jai Cortney's beard, this trailer is designed to hide disappointment."
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOME!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Now it's clear this would never have fit-in with the Nolan's grounded universe.
CmRih_VtVAs,this ill wath
CmRih_VtVAs,why do i get the feeling harley quinn is going to steal the show?
CmRih_VtVAs,with this song the trailer is just perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so good🤔🤔

CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't looks that good :(
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else got the feeling that the Joker wont be the main antagonist, but rather a secondary villain/possible ally. I mean, what were those scaly faceless guys attacking the Squad ? It didnt look like masks, and that thing in the subway didnt look like something Joker could create or control. Im starting to have the feeling that Enchantress is not on our side after all........"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, what the hell's wrong with you people... -_-
If you're horney then go to PornHub...."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, what the hell's wrong with you people I saw a comment in particular... -_-
If you're horny then go to PornHub....﻿"
CmRih_VtVAs,no
CmRih_VtVAs,there is always hate on dc trailers. they always find the smallest stuff to pick on.
CmRih_VtVAs,😴😴😴😴😴
CmRih_VtVAs,passes out
CmRih_VtVAs,Очередное аморальное гавно.
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a big Batman Fan I predict this film will be utter garbage. I think WB thought ""Hey lets put all the Batman villains that have not appeared on screen before and give them all stupid as hell tattoos and make them all really freakin dumb. Also the new Joker, We go from Mark Hamill to a guy with grills and a tattoo that says damaged. This is why I stick to the Batman comics, the animated series, and  the Arkham Games."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why does Harley fucking Quinn sound like the most basic bitch on the planet???? Like are you joking right now, even when she was still Harleen Quinzell she had an accent holy Christ.  And Killer Croc is shorter than dead shot??? I hate all of you. Btw Enchantress can't act for shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally a fun movie that isn't all depressing with responsibility, I get that in my life as it is."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally a fun movie that isn't all depressing with responsibility, I get that in my life as it is."

CmRih_VtVAs,like moths to a flame.
CmRih_VtVAs,like moths to a flame.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh yeah. First one to comment. I will give two reasons why I will not see this movie. 1. Other than the Joker and Harley Quinn, I do not know who any of the characters are. And 2. Jared Leto has NOTHING over Heath Ledger as the Joker. Absolutely nothing."
CmRih_VtVAs,that shitty music ruined everything
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Marvel's going to copy this idea with Thunderbolts
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the sincrony with the song!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still on the fence its probably because I don't know the characters that well though besides joker and Harley really
CmRih_VtVAs,joker israélien
CmRih_VtVAs,when she bends over.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody worked so well for the creepy/crazy aspect.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know, people are pausing at 2:07 for Harley-ass, but..there's Latin all around her, ""Si vis pacem, para bellum""  ""If you want peace, prepare for war""  Little touch there."
CmRih_VtVAs,it truly shows how Hollywood aint got not story no more
CmRih_VtVAs,hhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Tremenda canción!!! ...el video no le hizo justicia.
CmRih_VtVAs,HO!!! When Harley bend over  just beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg tht song is fucking gay  lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope it's not one of those movies with a good Trailer but a shitty movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I just love that they used Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody as soundtrack..... Gotta love me some Freddie Mercury ;)

CmRih_VtVAs,Why think I saw batman in helicopter
CmRih_VtVAs,"My biggest fear is that they'll make this make this a light-hearted movie about lovable rogues who've just had a hard time of it who band together and redeem themselves (similar to Guardians of the Galaxy). I want these characters to be SUPERVILLAINS who are FORCED to do good. They can make jokes here and there but I want this movie to be dark and when I'm watching it, I don't want to be allowed to forget that these are hard-core psychotic maniacs. Do that and it'll be good.... "

CmRih_VtVAs,Why Jared Leto?  WHY?
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Cara. <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Best thing about it was the music. I do hope that it is better than Assult on Arkham.
CmRih_VtVAs,"can you please stop with these meta ironic statements? ""we're bad guys"" oh hahah, same shit with deadpool ""it's not that kind of super hero movie"". yeah we get that you are making a really cool movie, but those silly jokes add nothing to it"
CmRih_VtVAs,"i so excised about this movie, i cant wait for it to come out #suicidesquad  <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,i am a marvel fan and i have to say this trailer is absolutely awesome

CmRih_VtVAs,everything was fine until queen theme came up. way to ruin the trailer (and movie)
CmRih_VtVAs,Only came here to see joker
CmRih_VtVAs,So.....  Anyone have any guesses what the fuck that thing is in the subway?   At 1:43 and 1:51?  I thought it was Enchantress at first but watching this at 0.25 speed I'm stumped.  Looks like fucking Chromastone or something
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still on the fence its probably because I don't know the characters that well though besides joker and Harley really
CmRih_VtVAs,everything was fine until queen theme came up. way to ruin the trailer (and movie)

CmRih_VtVAs,"На мой взгляд это очередная хрень для детей. Удивительно что тут много лайкнувших это видео детей любят и фанатеют от такой хрени. Тем кто снимает такое всегда выгодно снимать такое дерьмо, которое народ будет проглатывать и требовать добавки каждый раз."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Out of the bunch, I think Jared Leto was given the hardest task: portraying the Joker so soon after the LEGEND Heath Ledger's absolutely definitive performance.  And I think Jared's done a phenomenal job. That is the part of the movie I am most looking forward to."
CmRih_VtVAs,beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn I love those floating text simulations, there very very niiiioooocccccccce. 👌🏻"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is cheesy as fuck. Bohemian rhapsody as the music? Haha, christ. Lines like...""we're bad guys, that's what we do"" - really? A total cringe fest, coming from someone who usually likes this type of film. It looks massively contrived and vapid. Do not want."
CmRih_VtVAs,"In the immortal words of Bart Scott, ""Can't wait."""

CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Harley as a guard at 0:06?
CmRih_VtVAs,we're bad guys that's what we do.  ultra facepalm
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks...kind of stupid. that's my first, initial reaction. OH, AND - as someone who is just plain _ignorant_ of comic books in general (sorry!), i have to ask, just so we're *_perfectly_** clear -* there *IS* such a thing as actual  *_SUPER_** POWERS* in this universe...giving the thing an ACTUALLY *COMIC* Book-ey/ heightened reality of supernaturalism and what? (not _at all_ a NEGATIVE, mind you; in fact it's downright... _REFRESHING),_ what with the whole post *Dark Knight* - era's absolutely _slavish_ devotion to this bizarre hyper ""reality"" and all. (so-CALLED) - i mean *honestly;* the entire idea of a man dressed as an anamorphic bat being taken (why so?) SERIOUSLY was, has been and IS a bit much *IN THE **_FIRST_** PLACE!!*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"at :46 is that a Trijicon RMR mounted to the slide of his pistol? I have a few of those, got one on my Smith and Wesson M&P Pro CORE and another I run on a 45 degree canted mount attached beneath the scope on my AR15 (when I run a scope). Also sometimes put one on my Ruger 10/22 for plinking around or doing Speed Steel matches. Fucking AWESOME optics."
CmRih_VtVAs,The people who made this trailer and the last one are Geniuses!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"does anyone else think that the joker in this trailer looks like acted by johnny deep?
in a mix between his character in black mass and his other crazy roles???"
CmRih_VtVAs,only watching course will Smith in it
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,only watching course will Smith in it
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate that they have to say ""They're/we're bad guys"" TWICE in the trailer. And ""You're going somewhere dangerous to do something that will get you killed"".
People that like comic books aren't stupid. We don't need things dumbed down and spelled out for us. I could understand the use of the second bit to avoid plot spoilers, but so help me, if anyone in the actual movie uses the phrase ""bad guys"" I'm walking out."
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel = Campy fun movies for the kiddies / DC = closer to the comic movies
CmRih_VtVAs,CHEESY!
CmRih_VtVAs,i think tom hardy dropped out of this because jai courtney became tom hardy and they couldn't have 2 tom hardys in the same movie

CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't look that interesting but then again I said the same about Ant-Man and Ant-Man turned out to be one of the best movies of 2015. Hoping this movie will do the same.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, Scott Eastwood is in this?  No word on who he's playing on IMDB.

Kinda tired of this guy being shoe-horned into high-profile films just because he's Clint's son."
CmRih_VtVAs,Muy bueno Capusoto!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks great only one problem...



Some super fanboys are gonna think this is real life and do this kind of shit outside the living room. Especially little kids."

CmRih_VtVAs,wheres spider man? show us SPIDERMAN!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,queen
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok i just fucking love comic book/super hero movies idk why people gotta be so fucking annoying and be fan boys and only like DC or Marvel like both have made amazing shows and movies why cant we all just love anything that comes out by either and love the genre as a whole instead of one or the other
CmRih_VtVAs,vim pelo DAVYJONES

CmRih_VtVAs,Now kids will ask us have you heard the new suicide squad song ?-_-
CmRih_VtVAs,lackshuh
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not sure about how the movie will be, but that's the most epic soundtrack of an Movie-Trailer EVER!
Except maybe the Wayne's World trailer back in 1992. :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Still more excited about Harley Quinn then the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,LETSSSSSS GO
CmRih_VtVAs,"When they first cast harley quinn, I was like ""yes! margot robbey is perfect. She basically did the harley voice in wolf of wall street!' Cut to this pile of crap and she has no accent at all. WTF?!"

CmRih_VtVAs,STOP! I CAN ONLY BE SO ERECT!
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the sont of the end ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Cast looks great minus Boomerang. Another disappointing performance from Jai Courtney :(  He was great in Spartacus, and since then Hollywood has tried to make him the next action hero instead of a supporting role and try and build from there...I also miss his blonde locks. His acting looks terrible in the trailer...Also I already like this Joker more than Ledger's...Yep I said it. I NEVER THOUGHT Ledger's Joker was as good as Jack's 1989 version...Maybe because that was a part of my childhood, I just thought Nicholson's Joker was Da Best Eva!!!!  I think Leto is gonna knock this one out of the park!"
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this? Some kind of suicide squad? *puts on CSI Miami sunglasses*
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn. I can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn. I can't wait

CmRih_VtVAs,Total misuse of a song for a trailer and Will Smith? uggh.
CmRih_VtVAs,16 million views in 1 day!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Тут явно нужна русская речь!
CmRih_VtVAs,ohohohohoho!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kids born in 1992 seeing this trailer for the first time. Anyone know the name of the song? Is that a new band? 

Kids born in 1982 seeing this trailer for the first time, Whaaat?! they used the Wayne's World theme song? losers! I know where that song is from. 

Kids born in 1972 seeing this trailer for the first time, its Queen you fucking morons, its fucking Queen singing that song. Freddy Fucking Mercury."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I didn't care much about this movie at first but wow, this trailer was put together so well!  After that awful BvS trailer, I might be more pumped about this movie more!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great visuals....poor song selection.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is the QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks so much fun
CmRih_VtVAs,which character is Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,which character is Will Smith

CmRih_VtVAs,"Watched over 15 times now and counting, likely to be 100 by the time it comes out."
CmRih_VtVAs,i saw groot in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Loved the 1st trailer, don't care for this one at all....  Maybe because of the soundtrack. Queen, seriously ?!! Ruined the tempo of the entire trailer in my opinion.  Still psyched to see it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks so good
CmRih_VtVAs,In terms of comics I'm more of a fan of Marvel but DC is kicking ass with the movies(both live action and animated).
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oooooo
Mmmmmmgggggg it comes out in my birthday!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of that song
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel have many heroes in civilwars but,DC have Harley Quinn and Joker :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think a stand-alone Harley Quinn movie would have been better than this. Superhero movies are so crammed-full of characters now that they're falling over (or flying into) each other. Everything's in the trailer, and very little is left for the actual movie. Loud colorful characters are sent on a mission... they succeed... they learn something about life... The End."
CmRih_VtVAs,Just me who thought the first trailer made this film look creepy and serious and dark as fuck and now it basically looks like a comedy??
CmRih_VtVAs,this film is sick
CmRih_VtVAs,this film is sick
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've never been so excited over a film, only because Cara's in it ❤️"
CmRih_VtVAs,worst joker and Harley Quinn ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Mega dam awesomely fine trailer...gotta go down as at least a classic trailer!!!... but cupla things: 

1) they STILL leave in Will Smith's ""Let's go save the world"" line which has to be cut from the final movie - he's a goddamn assassin for f**k sake!... No place for it.
2) and Joker? Well - this is an over-the-top mega cool lookin' movie... & all the Squad's  characters seem perfectly sized up in weirdness & badness... but I get the gut felin', they try to make Joker even more than them... so they may overdo it with the Joker if they ain't careful... 

... still gonna go see it though :-)... Hell YEA!"
CmRih_VtVAs,that the film will get close to the box-office star wars
CmRih_VtVAs,"I did't know of this till i saw it at the beginning of another youtube video. Each time when this trailer get played the Freddy's corpse shakes in his grave. Sorry for the Queen that accepted to put one of their best song on the trailer of such a horrible movie, if one could call this movie at all. ten thumbs down. I do not like this wave of Marvel/DC things. I cannot call them movie at all, cause I have to change the definition of movies. Some explosions with couple of supposedly cool characters in front of a camera is not a MOVIE."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, at least it got Queen's song :D"

So they found a way to criticize BvS by claiming SS trailer to be better, then they are bitching for it being a copy of shitty GOTG, while they don't know the Suicide squad was in works from 2010 and script was ready, they were just waiting for The dark knight trilogy to finish as Nolan didn't wanted two live-action Batman universes on the screens at the same time."

CmRih_VtVAs,That Harley Quinn character is getting really fucking annoying.
CmRih_VtVAs,It feels like Deadshot is the only sane person on the team.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok so 5K shit eating marvel fanboys disliked this video because they are to childish to admit that this is better than any marvel movie ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,That Queen song tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, this film is very cool"
CmRih_VtVAs,Good ☺
CmRih_VtVAs,Good ☺
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't delete my comment suka
CmRih_VtVAs,"People who claims to love DC'S characters so much but wants them to fail are NOT real fans. They try to say that they are only to give credibility to their hate. The ones saying Leto's Joker will never beat Ledger's Joker"" or saying ""Gal Gadot is still too skinny"" after seeing the epicness of the Wonder Woman clips. These are people who will never give these new characters a chance. Some how they find it easier to wish for a time machine to bring back the past. You cannot reason with these people. They will never let go of tired unrealistic expectations such as ""Heath should've played the joker"". The Suicide Squad trailer hit every single mark haters set for it. It had heart and humor, Characters true to their comicbook counterparts with a slight realistic edge, it had action, color, Queen. If you thought it was a BAD trailer don't ever watch another comicbook movie again.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Switch soundtrack with Master of puppets- Metalica PLZ
CmRih_VtVAs,"Group Shot at 1:09
 Get's me laughing everytime!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Group Shot at 1:09

CmRih_VtVAs,This is either going to be really good or the biggest flop in the history of superheroe movies
CmRih_VtVAs,"Isn't Batman supposed to be in suicide squad? Obviously he's not part of the squad, but I thought he was supposed to be in it?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks great.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer never made me bored unlike others. Excited to watch this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Might be a'ight except for Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey gays hello bitches
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is gonna get alot of money from the looks of these views and likes right now
CmRih_VtVAs,I've got a bad feeling about this movie...People are getting too hasty and too thirsty for comic action movies...I think this is going to be bonkers.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hm.. Not sure about the rest, but Margot looks great as Harley. Perhaps better than I ever imagined.
And maybe this movie will make me like two of the most hated actors in the universe: Will Smith and the Ausie who gets to play in big budget movies for fun."

CmRih_VtVAs,"How many Marvel movies are actually ""good"" Captain America Winter Soldier - Amazing 
Iron Man 1 - Great 
Guardians of the Galaxy - Amazing 

the avengers is the most overrated movie Iv ever seen in my life , it is corny , the first hour is awful and it's just to childish , the Thor movies are unwatchable , by far the worst humor , Marvel has just had MORE movies then DC that doesn't mean their better , DC heroes and villains are millions of times better and we will see it come to fruition very very soon"
CmRih_VtVAs,velho sensacional
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll have you know I only came 9 times.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07

CmRih_VtVAs,Why is the sphere eye guy from original sin at 1:21 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Most I like is the song insert in this trailer hehe. And I have a feeling joker could be the villain in this movie. No spoilers I don't know anything just feels like it
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG Queen!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"i'm a simple man. I hear Bohemian Rhapsody, i upvote !"
CmRih_VtVAs,"WOW! Been a long time since i saw a good trailer. the bohemian rhapsody + the trailer = Goosebumps.

CmRih_VtVAs,song ruined it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tattooed man in the subway. I'm guessing Joker's behind all the chaos. Tries to use Enchantress as well. Also guessing the car chase with Batman is towards the end after the Joker get's Harley back from Amanda, and when Batman's inside men (Eastwood? Katana?) find out Joker's running things. Also guessing Slipknot doesn't last too long."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone seems to be more excited for this the Batman V Superman . Don't get me wrong this looks amazing , it truly does , but BATMAN V SUPERMAN ! That's a cinematic triumph , it's the most beloved super heroes on screen together for the first time and yes it looks awesome , people are hating on something that no one has even seen yet , the last trailer was edited bad that's it , Ben Affleck has shown to be the truest Batman to the comics so far , the movie is dark because the source material is ! Everyone stop bitching and enjoy both"

CmRih_VtVAs,Squad goals
CmRih_VtVAs,"My issue with movies nowadays is that they now make minorities and women, (or minority women in many cases), the heroes, or the one's in charge, or the smartest people in the room, while making the white males the dumbest person in the room or the evil villains. Examples: Suicide Squad, Ant Man (the genius that came up with the idea and the person that trained Ant Man), Star Wars (who was the main star and who was the villain), I could go on and on."
CmRih_VtVAs,чё это за хуйня??
CmRih_VtVAs,And already 15 million views...and only barely half a million likes? Come on people...it's something different for once.
CmRih_VtVAs,look's AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,"So far so good for the Joker.

1) Jered Leto joker looks more like the joker than Heath
2) From the trailer, the joker might be actually using joker toys unlike heath joker that doesn't

I'm not sure why people always say heath joker is the best. Heath joker aren't even joker... he is more like a gangster/thug than the prince of clown. Heath did a fine job in the movie but it ain't joker..."
CmRih_VtVAs,look's AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing but why did they need so many guys to bring out Deadshot? it didn't really look like he was gonna do much with his fists

CmRih_VtVAs,Who's here from snapchat?
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is on something way stronger than weed.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sure all the deviant punks ,  simpsons and family guy loving, rude, insulting, degenerates, will simply love this movie. Movie seems interesting, but guess what, deviants are glorified too much. Too many sheeple are filled up with cable tv and thats a reason I probably wont be able to appreciate this movie because the degenerate poison is every where. DOWN WITH THE ANTI-SOCIAL PEOPLE!"

I would like to point out though that she is the only one who is ridiculously underdressed. Everyone else is covered up apart from her. She is just gonna be the sex appeal. Like wonder womans new costume, whose skirt is like 2cm long. DC needs to rely on better characters, not big white asses and boobs to do well."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone keeps comparing this to Guardians Of the Galaxy, but the Suicide Squad comics have been around since the late 50's. Plus, what makes this most different is that Task Force X is made up of EXPENDABLE agents. Meaning that if Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) feels like it, she will pop their head off and send another incarcerated villain in the battle front (or at least that's how it is in the comics). These guys are working off their sentences, but it is no volunteer work. They're fighting to keep their lives. That is what makes Suicide Squad so special."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I should kill everyone and escape?
sorry...the voices
ahaha I'm kidding!

CmRih_VtVAs,Por esto se la metieron a Wismichu >:V
CmRih_VtVAs,"One thing is clear about Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment’s take on Suicide Squad: it’s going to be a change of pace from the usual comic book blockbuster. There’s action, sure, and more than a few laughs and CG-heavy jaw-droppers, but from the official posters to the movie’s first trailer, the rebellious spirit at its heart shines through everything else. And the brand new trailer is no exception."

CmRih_VtVAs,Why did they pick that song; totally  disjointed from the action.  It's like the 1980s equivalent of some 2010 radio pop song playing during a trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie & Cara Delevingne.. and they are being bad..HELL YEAH !!
CmRih_VtVAs,So many people pretend to be some expert critics (as if they know anything about moviemaking) when they try to make their little arguments as to why this trailer or that trailer is bad. It's sad.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks shit. Like most Marvel movies nowadays ... It's all business, much like the gaming industry and AAA titles. The same damn plot and generic formula, the same humour. Why? Because it's been proven to a be success and sells well. Growing tired of these American Blockbuster movies.
Would be good to return to the good old days of proper film Directors with their own visions and artistic talents ... Whereby plot decisions were not made around a table in an office by idiots whose sole purpose is to make themselves and their firm as much $$$ as possible. My input, but I'll probably get flamed for it anyway... Don't care. ;) It's true and you know it."

CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie and Batman vs Superman, looks better than anything Marvel has put out in the years. the first Avengers sucked, age of Ultron sucked, both Captain America movies sucked, ant man sucked, The Garden of the galaxy was the only good movie Marvel has put out lately. other then that, Marvel movies are overrated and they all are boring trash in my opinion... DC JLU will easily be better than all those boring kiddie Marvel Disney movies.

Marveltards come at me faggots."

CmRih_VtVAs,I would like to 69 with harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm kind of sick of people comparing the Heath ledger joker to Jared Leto. They are completely two different jokers. Might be a surprise to most people, but there is multiple ways to do a successful joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one wishing the first time that they finally included harley quinn in a movie it was the original harley and not the new version from the comics(you know what i mean)? i don't know how to feel.
CmRih_VtVAs,you think there gonna make avenger three in 2018
CmRih_VtVAs,you think there gonna make avenger three in 2018

CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith? Why  do directors use this guy over and over ? the guy can't fucking act!!! now im pissed off cuz this movie could've been killer , fuck WILL SMITH"
CmRih_VtVAs,why soo many dislike?

CmRih_VtVAs,i'm scary to see the comment section
CmRih_VtVAs,"Might be good, but I'm not holding my breath. DC has a petty poor track record for any movie that isn't strictly Batman (not counting the Schumacher films)."
CmRih_VtVAs,too much action
CmRih_VtVAs,So fucking hyped! I can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,So fucking hyped! I can't wait!

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm now starting 2 like dc more than marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this its just 2 good
CmRih_VtVAs,Lets not ignore the fact that Cara's Enchantress looks cool as fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,Шедевр!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2016. The year Dc does better then marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"Those one liners in the movie are soooo stupid & cheesy. Seriously did the writer try to be funny or kool and hip? Cuz its really cheesy like Will Smith character. He's a dead actor from the early 2000s & has cheesy dialogue lines (Like seriously cheerleading practice ??? STUPID) . The Croc character looked like a idiot cos playing more then the real thing. 

Harley Quin also had really cheesy one liners that are boring & dull & nothing about wat she said in the trailer seemed original. Even the batman games she was WAY better (Voices in her head ? Stupid)  Also Harley Quinn has a NY kind of voice which we all know of. Here she has a generic boring voice. 

Joker here looks awful. Its cheesy, his teeth look stupid as hell & looks like Mayo on his face lol. He looks like one of the reject morons from Batman & Robin lol. Im sure you remember those. Worse joker ever in voice/ dialogue/ character. So far the movie looks stupid & boring with nothing in here that makes it stand up besides all of them being in 1 film. (Shrugs uh....yeah lol)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Movie looks ass, green lantern was and will be 10,000 times better."
CmRih_VtVAs,So is the enemy guy like Christmas tree Groot? O.o
CmRih_VtVAs,haters gonna hate just cause its not avengers.
CmRih_VtVAs,"For anyone concerned about the Joker, just keep this in mind: Batfleck. If _that's_ a Batman, you can only imagine how dangerous the Joker is, which I'm betting on is in a different league than the past incarnations."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else only watched this for Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Cadê os BR daqui??
CmRih_VtVAs,1:20 i said that to my girlfriend and 1:35 i f**king laughed my ass off to that one... NO drinking on the job!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The perfect trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone who thinks this trailer sucked, go to your civil war trailer and jerk off to ironman crying to captain America about not being his friend :("
CmRih_VtVAs,"Intrigue, save please."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yes, yes, a thousand times YES!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yes, yes, a thousand times YES!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Intrigue, save please."
CmRih_VtVAs,A little tryhard but I hope it's good as a different take on the Suicide Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,please tell me what's the song in the trailer

CmRih_VtVAs,huh
CmRih_VtVAs,"not sure why people complaining about Harley Quinn, she always acted like a terrible over the top actress in the cartoons lol, her character was always annoying in every adaptation I've ever seen"
CmRih_VtVAs,That fucking laugh. Jared Leto has single handedly ruined this.
CmRih_VtVAs,That fucking laugh. Jared Leto has single handedly ruined this.
CmRih_VtVAs,That laugh. Jared Leto has single handedly ruined this.

CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto will make a perfect description of a comic book joker type character. He proved he can put himself in any role by playing a transvestite in Dallas buyers club. Gonna be a way better joker than Nicholson an Ledger.

CmRih_VtVAs,"A mostly lackluster cast, nothing really interesting going on (unless of course you think pow, pow, bang bang etc. is engaging content)... time to pull out a classic pop rock song with a huge following as a diversion. I will say the only thing that briefly grabbed my attention is the creepy wide-mouthed laugh face of the lame new Joker. Its almost impressive in how not great it looks so they ""succeeded"" in that regard."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope this will be the first DC action comedy movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"comment section on dc's and marvel's movies should be deleted, hate to read those baby's comment"
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this movie rated?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the enchantress looking kinda hmmm. would be a great team if they replace her to poison ivy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"in the comic, there should be deathstroke, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is Not mad enough... and where's her high pitch voice?
CmRih_VtVAs,"in the comic, there should be deathstroke, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now watch, every bitch on fucking planet is going to try and act like Harley Quinn. Its gonna be worse than the Nicki Minaj 'barbie' fangirls. Fucking bullshit, my inner hipster is angry!"

CmRih_VtVAs,Lets make a child harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer has been out for like a day and it almost has just as many views as the Batman V Superman trailer that came out like a month ago. Never would have thought when it was first announced, but I think it's gonna make more at the box office."
CmRih_VtVAs,oh man
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53 <3 omg!!
CmRih_VtVAs,oh man
CmRih_VtVAs,Could Marvel/Disney potentially sue for COMPLETELY ripping off 'The Orb' at 1:21 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,JINX. Kbye
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT A TRAILER. Well done!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now watch, every bitch on the fucking planet is going to try and act like Harley Quinn. It's gonna be worse than the Nicki Minaj Barbie fangirls, fucking bullshit, my inner hipster is angry!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think this film is gonna be more popular than Batman v Superman, and they will make more films based off of these characters. They seem way more interesting tbh."
CmRih_VtVAs,vim pelo davy Jones se loko cachuera
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it wrong to be watching this on a loop ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I heard everyone bashing this but I come here and I'm like ""this is better than I thought it was going to be""."
CmRih_VtVAs,n e one know the name that jared leto is rocking as the joker I want to get it cut like that but iono what to ask my barber fo I figured I just them a few photos but was wondering what you would call his hairstyle.

CmRih_VtVAs,Now THIS is what I call a good trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,My type of squad goals
CmRih_VtVAs,Vim pelo dexota
CmRih_VtVAs,suicide squad looks like watchmen on acid

CmRih_VtVAs,"Bvs trailer 2 = 21 million views in a month, suicide squad trailer = 16 million views in less than a day!."

CmRih_VtVAs,"As a gay girl, I can't handle Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie gorgeousness.
She is just too much."
CmRih_VtVAs,0:06 Angry Granpa?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't think Rick Flagg's going to survive. He seems like the killjoy, ""good guy"" member of the team, trying to keep the others in line, which obviously isn't going to work. I think he'll get killed and Deadshot will become the de facto leader."
CmRih_VtVAs,Love it
CmRih_VtVAs,Love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer is so darn good I'm not sure the movie can reach the same quality.
CmRih_VtVAs,@Shan Sharkyshark it's very disappointing
CmRih_VtVAs,This is like an more badass and insane version of Guardians of the Galaxy lol
CmRih_VtVAs,HELP.....cant stop watchn this damn trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Yikes. Looks like Maggie Roberts did not get the accent down at all... Oh well I will give her a chance anyway.
CmRih_VtVAs,HELP....cant stop watchn this  trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,HELP....cant stop watchn this fukn trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,HELP....cant stop watchn this damn trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,HELP....cant stop watchn this damn trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Have they ever said who scott eastwood and Adam beach was going to play in this film? because I notice that beach where's a resemblance suit and hair-curl to Deathstroke.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everything starting with the Logo , the music, everything was so well done and in sync . I'd have to say it's the best super hero(or vilians ?) trailer i've ever seen ."
CmRih_VtVAs,... Who else is annoyed at the lack of accent from Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,We're sooo excited
CmRih_VtVAs,At least this will be better than those pile of shit Avengers (power rangers) movies fact
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok I'm actually hyped to see Jared's performance as Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is the psychotic woman of my deranged dreams.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best trailer for anything I've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer gives 2nd thought on movie :l
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer gives 2nd thought on movie :l

CmRih_VtVAs,I WANT BRONZE TIGER
CmRih_VtVAs,its look fuking stupid  bad actor's
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the Joker's laugh
CmRih_VtVAs,WOOOOO *harley voice* ! Haters you're like 4k. Just make a squad together and kill yourselfs. Thanks
CmRih_VtVAs,No disrespect to Will Smith but a black Dead Shot? Is this positive discrimination?
CmRih_VtVAs,:)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margo Robbie is reppin Harley Quinn like an absolute boss, holy shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do some many of you have to fight over Marvel and DC? Am I the only who loves superhero movies and don't care if they are from Marvel or DC.. Let them fight we will enjoy 4 superhero movies in 2016..:D
CmRih_VtVAs,to all those who said marvel is better in cinema
CmRih_VtVAs,Couldn't have picked a better song.
CmRih_VtVAs,"4,000 Avengers Disliked this"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who thinks Harley's outfit is F'in stupid, It's one thing to ""sexy"" up a character but they totally abandon the Harley Quinn aspect of the character for booty shorts and the Roller derby slut look. Does it have to do with albino white grill wearing tattooed up Joker? It just seems like they are leaping away from what makes some of these characters for a silly watered down over sexualized  versions of the character."
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad > Batman vs Superman. I'm calling it now
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody as background music nails it ^^
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto or Heath ledger...
CmRih_VtVAs,WILSON!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07  hdsssssssygttgv77fd87hgx sorry I was just cleaning off my keyboard.....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad & Batman V Superman are gonna steal all the thunder.
But watchout for Spiderman in Civil war,"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really cannot believe that this is in the same universe as Dawn of Justice. Like.....really? This is our Joker and Harley Quinn? It's pathetic.
CmRih_VtVAs,I convince people.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If only Mad Max could have been in this movie.
Got to admit, the song is louder than the images. 
They should have used something a little more discrete."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Based on all of the trailers (Deadpool, Civil War, Suicide Squad, Batman vs Superman) only one looks like complete shit! Batman vs Superman looks absolutely terrible! I mean fucking bad! So bad, I'd rather watch After Earth or even fucking Sharknado... Jared Leto in the scenes I saw actually looks like a good joker, and the comedic flare is here! Deadpool is just downright hilarious throughout the entire trailer, and seamlessly nails Deadpool. Civil War shows a conflict that not only divides the characters, but the viewers! Batman vs Superman... Uhh... Hmm... ""The red capes are coming?"" Plus why does batman have a gun!? Why is batman such a push over? Why does Wonder Woman exist here, and seems like she'll play a part only at the end? Why in the actual fuck did they insert Apocalypse in a movie about Batman and Superman fighting? Too much shit shoved in!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hancock in prison.. again
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 you will thanks me for this
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who is replaying the entire video again and again for Bohemian Rhapsody and not the movie? Freddie's voice makes this trailer so epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Man I love this song
CmRih_VtVAs,best movie year ever
CmRih_VtVAs,best movie year ever

CmRih_VtVAs,If even half as good as it looks I'll be extremely happy:)
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks like it could be a great movie, but I don't like what they're doing to Harley Quinn."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a badass trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know how I feel about this...kinda seems like it's trying too hard to be ""cool"" especially with the overused song. I'll watch it though lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know how I feel about this...kinda seems like it's trying too hard to be ""cool"" especially with the overused song. I'll watch it though lol."

CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks stupid!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Got me for the song choice. Also, Leto looks fucking great. If I watch this movie he's the reason."
CmRih_VtVAs,Or Swamp Thing!!!??? XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm all for the superhero stuff, but this doesn't look like something I'd watch. But hey, that's just my opinion. I hope anyone who wants to see it enjoys it. :-)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Are they hunting Martian Manhunter for the government or what?!? Soo much green! Lol cautiously optimistic! I've always been a DC fanboy! Never read very much Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT SONG IS THAT
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT SONG IS THAT
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this movie is a big success and Leto nails it, do you think there will be an active Leto Joker in the DC universe for future movies?"
CmRih_VtVAs,They didn't bring batman here....hope its a surprise.
CmRih_VtVAs,yes please
CmRih_VtVAs,"""This looks pretty ok, why did I ever dislike the idea of this movie?""

CmRih_VtVAs,"Some people complain about the over saturation of comic book movies. I laugh at those plebs. Haha I say! Less movies for them to enjoy and more for us. 
I plead with my fellow nerds to help create an era for our passion. Attend every superhero release that you deem worthy. This is our time to reap the rewards of entertainment for it is temporary. Beauty is temporary. Let us bask in it...yes I'm drunk."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is a million times than better than Batman V Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"What REALLY annoys me is Harley's voice. I'm sorry but I (and pretty sure many others) know Harley for that iconic voice. Why couldn't they just hire tat woman who played as Harley from the Batman LIVE play, she played as Harley and nailed the voice dead on!!!!! The same could be said with the Joker's voice too, get someone who can nail his voice. Directors don't get that not every actor has to a celebrity. But other than that movie looks great!"

CmRih_VtVAs,EYO WHOL THE FUCK UP
CmRih_VtVAs,*boner*
CmRih_VtVAs,im so hype for this movie!!
CmRih_VtVAs,From watching these trailers I got a funny feeling that Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is gonna completely steal the show from everyone including Jared Leto's Joker. She seems taylor-made for the role
CmRih_VtVAs,got a boner don't know if from harley or joker in the suit shooting the gun :)
CmRih_VtVAs,got a boner don't know if from harley or joker in the suit shooting the gun :)
CmRih_VtVAs,0:16 man crocs cell is like a cheap zoo enclosure
CmRih_VtVAs,question! why is harley quinn in that acid looking bubble bath
CmRih_VtVAs,The reason why they didn't have her do the Bronx accent associated with Harley Quinn is because the actor for her can't pull off an accent while remaining convincing on camera. It probably sounded bad/cheesey so they had her use her regular voice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"What bugs me the most is that people classify DC as just ""Dark movies"" having only seen the Nolan Batman trilogy and Man of Steel. Although I agree that the darker tone in man of Steel may not have fit the character, I do think it was an interesting take, that really sets up some interesting possibilities for the future of the DCEU. I think, based on the first trailer, that BvS will analyze the implications of Superman's actions, and really develop Superman as a character to a satisfactory level. In my opinion, I think the DCEU will delve deeper into the different characters and their respective worlds, because each major hero comes from a vastly different and new background. Based on the tv special, it seems like they're really focusing on that aspect of the universe, and that is why I think that each movie released will be its own separate entity, while at the same time, fitting into the bigger universe. I do really enjoy the MCU movies, but they can seem kind of redundant after a while, especially in the character development. No offense to the MCU because they're doing a fantastic job, but it feels to me like those movies are made more to get the biggest box-office draw rather than being a unique and beautiful piece. That being said, from what I've seen so far, the DCEU seems to be employing a different formula for each of the movies that have been revealed so far, which differs from the cookie-cutter superhero blockbuster that we have gotten used to. BatmanvSuperman looks to be a more psychological view at a conflict between two godlike figures. Where each character is well defined in their motives. It feels to me like kind of a Watchmen vibe, where there is no real ""bad guy"" but more two very powerful people clashing about the right way to do things. However, it will go farther than that to show that there really is a bad guy, Luthor, pulling the strings in the background and causing the conflict. No more speculation about the third act of BvS, but based on the first trailer from Comic-Con, pretty sure that that's what the beginning is about. Suicide Squad is a more rough and tumble action flick while at the same time bringing together many contrasting characters and viewpoints. I don't think that Ayer will go into motives and backstories for the characters, which is probably a good thing, but each character's personality will be prevalent and distinct for what is, in essence, a dark comedy shoot'em up. From what we've seen of the other movies, they will each have not only their own distinct tone, but also a whole new world to introduce us to for each film. From what I've seen from the DCEU so far, I have nothing but positive comments, especially the television special, which really gave me confidence in their ability to treasure each specific character and transfer them from the comic books to the big screen without compromising their characteristics for a monetary box-office gain. Really happy with the job they've done so far, and I sure hope they don't prove me wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,I  sold on Leto as Joker. He is of course not Mark but I like his Joker from the little I have seen. I am not convinced with Will Smith as deadshot though. It is just off. Deadshot is a serious character and he has his own darkness. Not getting that vibe from Will Smith.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Did anyone else see a heart shape in the liquid vat when Joker is pulling Harley out?

Also I think that scene where Joker pulls Harley from the vat is how she became Harley Quinn. If you pay close attention, the colors are pink and blue, the same color as her hair. I'm guessing most likely that the pink is from the dye seeping out from the Joker's pink/purple shirt and the blue is from Harleen's blue shirt. Thus, it's probably how she got her hair dyed those colors."

-Toma dos personajes que todo el mundo conoce y conviertelos en una versión pseudo-hipster emo de ellos mismos para causar controversia en las redes. 
-Toma unas cuantas super estrellas de la talla de Will Smith y Jared Leto para hacer los papeles principales. 
-Toma a la modelo (Delevingne) más explotada y quemada por las adolescentes únicas y diferentes para ser (segun teorias) la villana principal.

I'm sorry, but lines like this from her aren't needed. We get she's crazy and she's a villain, but she's overstating it by saying too many things that are all about ""I'm crazy and a bad girl, now look at me as I make completely obvious jokes about it."" There's so much more potential for lines with some more originality and unexpectedness to them. Instead of making completely generic statements and jokes about how crazy and mad you are, why not just act better that way and make more original and unique jokes showing us a good Harley Quinn and not drown us with forced lines stating the attributes we already know your character is supposed to have....

I know it's the writer's to blame for what she says, but c'mon. This joke had some originality towards the end where she actually ended up saying ""...that's not what they said"" but the delivery of that entire line made it feel like it was just wasted potential due to it being rushed and overdone. All jokes require certain timing, and she rushed through it. It definitely would've been more satisfying to watch if the timing was more natural and it was just overall not so forced."

This looks awesome! Just shut up everyone. I love both Marvel and DC, I think the real fan boy battles should be between, Fox and Marvel not Marvel and DC. The competitiveness of Marvel and DC is good, it benefits both sides as they make better and better movies, and they keep the comic book genre popular for each other's movies. The rivalry between Fox and Marvel is only hurting them, as we don't get to see all the character cross over we want, and countless stories can't be told because of it."

CmRih_VtVAs,Como osan utilizar una canción tan perfecta para una película de acción. Espero y enserio valga la pena profanar esta canción.
CmRih_VtVAs,Como osan utilizar una canción tan perfecta para una película de acción. Espero y enserio valga la pena profanar esta canción.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS GONNA BE A GREAT YEAR FOR COMIC BOOKS
CmRih_VtVAs,You can tell it's going to be good when you tingle to the choice of music.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is that song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jokers fucking tattoos look like one of the executive producers Emo son came up with the idea for them, And those silver teeth look horrendous and that fucking neon green hair makes him look more like a fruit cake than the joker i swear I've always disliked jared leto as an actor and a musician and now i feel like he's just gonna ruin what heath ledger left behind, everything else looks pretty cool but this new joker is just ridiculous dude."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel would destroy DC, movie wise, if they took their plot and their characters behavior more seriously. The thing I love about DC movies is that they are ok the darker side."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've watched this 5 times in a row
I think I have a problem"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks fucking terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks fucking terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn so much I'm so excited
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like how the tagline is ""Worst heroes ever"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Only good thing about this was the music.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice. Now the comment sections of bohemian rhapsody will be full of kids saying suicide squad brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,각시탈 은 뭐임???
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still not quite feeling it with this one. DC either tries too hard or not hard enough, and I love DC."
CmRih_VtVAs,That looks badass.
CmRih_VtVAs,F*** I was  hoping for an R rating. (I knew I had one strike against me when Will Smith was cast!) This trailer besides the awesome bleeping Queen song screams PG-13.  The studio heads who only worried about the profits and box office should go **** *** ******** ** **** ***!!!!!!  I think the SQ is one comic for adults this could have been a F****** amazing in r rated form.  I would love to see a DC Comic in r-rated form.  Enough with the PC shit I thought these where bad guys!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how much the suicide rate will increase from people seeing the title of this movie and subsequently getting suicide into their heads.
CmRih_VtVAs,foda d++
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how the action is in sync with the beat of the music
CmRih_VtVAs,Different! Interesting!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen makes for an awesome trailer, The Deadshot mask makes it an even more awesome trailer....Jared Leto's Joker Laugh: I need a new pair of pants cause that was so AWESOME!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad=Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,can't fucking wait
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie doesn't look like it's going to be good... IMO tbh I don't know much about the suicide squad because I'm more of a marvel fan. But I've watched a lot of the batman animated series and other DC cartoons and I know enough about Harley and Joker to know that they're portrays are waaaay off. I mean I can't judge off one trailer but my hopes for this movie are low
CmRih_VtVAs,can't fucking wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Is cara poison ivy?

i literally just puke out of sheer joy"
CmRih_VtVAs,Was i the only one who grinned hard as hell when i saw will smith?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Momma we made it! 
Look at my sexi ass in 2:32 😎

U mad ? 😭"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'D TOTALLY SEE THIS JUST CUZ OF THE SONG BY QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,wow...
CmRih_VtVAs,This joker will be shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 That's Tatoo-man
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool should crash this trailer. That would be epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,oh ledger why did you have to die...smh
CmRih_VtVAs,This is basically a fancy version of X-Men .
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever edited this trailer deserves a oscar
CmRih_VtVAs,This is basically a fancy version of X-Men .
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope the movie is better than the trailer. . .  Because the trailer is F---ING AWESOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so cringe-worthy
CmRih_VtVAs,TENTACLE!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else notice that Deadshot's 'eye' is on the left side instead of the right as it is in the comics?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, it's what we do""

CmRih_VtVAs,MARGO ROBBIE 😍😍😉
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like how 2:05  Killer Croc's like, *YO!! WTF girl?*"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so gay
CmRih_VtVAs,eh it feels a bit cheesy
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no doubts this movie is going to flop. Hard.
CmRih_VtVAs,ni me gusta ver a will Smith aqui creo que no cuadra
CmRih_VtVAs,ni me gusta ver a will Smith aqui creo que no cuadra
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling this movie is going to be better than Dawn of Justice.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone in this group has some sort of crazy skill or power. But the Joker and Harley are just regular
 average joes who are just crazy. It makes no sense to put them in this special task force."
CmRih_VtVAs,The song makes this trailer perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just realized something. Everyone in this group has some sort of crazy skill or power. But the Joker and Harley are just regular
 average joes who are just crazy. It makes no sense to put them in this special task force."
CmRih_VtVAs,Its amazing how Jared Leto is still hot even with green hair and a silver grill.

CmRih_VtVAs,This comes out in August ?? Fuuck
CmRih_VtVAs,"I thought Harley Quinn was supposed to be in this movie. Where is she? I see no charming quirky blondes with a black and red diamond motif. There's some blonde chick with a red and blue bubblegum motif, but that can't possibly be Harley. Harley combines childlike innocence with uncontrolled anarchy, wears pants, and has a personality outside of being pretty arm candy. Does this kid even say ""puddin'?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"MCU/Disney is all like ""Our movie villains are too bland and forgettable!"" and DC/WB is all like ""Here's a movie about supervillains!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, this trailer actually has me looking forward to this movie now. But I still don't like the look of the Joker and why the hell does Harley not have an accent? The actress could have used the same exact one as in The Wolf of Wall Street."
CmRih_VtVAs,songs names
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think that The Joker is a fashion diva, he wear a lot of differents suits and clothes in the trailer. xD
Love this trailer and the music!"
CmRih_VtVAs,songs names

CmRih_VtVAs,"I think that The Joker is a fashion diva, he wear a lot of differents suits and clothes in the trailer. xD
Fuck*ng love this trailer and the music!"

CmRih_VtVAs,seriously ... we must wait half year to watch this ? why don't release it already ... i mean all scene have been shot right ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks really cool.I just wish they didnt say ""oh we are the bad guys"" all the time."
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay we get it suicide squad! No more trailers I don't want to be completely spoiled like batman vs superman!!! The trailers told me everything!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks really cool.I just wish they didnt say ""oh we are the bad guys"" all the time."

CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn looks like someone you would find at a EDM festival.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dc has just won my respect
CmRih_VtVAs,cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Steve-O would make a great joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker looks like Marilyn Manson, but this trailer did get me hyped for the movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"really weird not hearing Harley with her accent, but she still has the attitude of Harley, so I still feel it's gonna go great."
CmRih_VtVAs,I really want to see this movie. I think it's gonna be hilarious and badass.
CmRih_VtVAs,Look at DC trying to make a movie that's weird and good at the same time....
CmRih_VtVAs,They make criminal acts look fun.😎😎
CmRih_VtVAs,"so basically she's blonde *Jinx!*

CmRih_VtVAs,"He looks more like Marilyn Manson, I guess thats not pretty good."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was so disappointed when I first saw Harley and Joker. But now, I'm excited. If Harley has more of the New York accent in the movie than in these trailers, I'll be satisfied. I was so scared Jared was gonna be too crazy and no laughs, but man he's almost if not better than Heath, from what we've seen so far which is saying something. His laugh, his voice, the theatrics, it's close to perfect. Very excited for this, wish it was coming sooner than August."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody, Kreygasm"
CmRih_VtVAs,Realy Realy shit. Help Nolan.
CmRih_VtVAs,좋아요

CmRih_VtVAs,"How many people are seriously considering this?: That's NOT the ""Real Joker"".
It's Jason Todd. Do the research."
CmRih_VtVAs,I had a grin on my face all the way through.

CmRih_VtVAs,rolmao where bad guys its what we do
CmRih_VtVAs,Bad way to start 2016 this movie is going to be trash. Harley Quinn is ugly and got casted a horrible actor. They ruined the Joker. And everyone else besides Deadshot.

CmRih_VtVAs,"David Ayer is a great choice for the movie. He mainly does ensemble crime movies, so it's right up his alley. He also said at Comic-Con this movie was about respecting the source material and canon, and this trailer feels like a comicbook come to life."
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain Boomerang about to steal the show
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think this is gonna be better than Batman v. Superman. Maybe, it's just because I don't have a lot of faith in Batman v. Superman (too many characters being introduced that should have their own movies, before being in someone else' movie).

That said, I still hate the new look for the Joker. I think Leto is going to give an awesome performance, but the failed rapper look still isn't doing it for me."

CmRih_VtVAs,jered leto is killing it as the joker <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Colors? Wit? Dark but not ""2 drk 4 u""? Could it be that WB has learned to appreciate and embrace the wackiness of the DC comics? I freaking hope so. 

I completely blanked this film during its production thinking it would be another WB misstep like Man of Steel and... well every DC movie adaption since the Dark Knight trilogy.  The initial character shots looked bad, but seeing them in action I can dig it. It seems like they might have actually learned a worthwhile lesson from Marvels successes."

CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer is better, gave it more of a mysterious vibe, no offense to queen but their song made the trailer seem cheesy, really no offense though well all have our own opinion. I still think the movie will be worth watching. 

Especially for Cara Delevingne and Margot Robbie 😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,I need to se this. NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,Mmm equis

Why would they not use Tara Strong she’s just as hot and she can do the voice perfectly.

CmRih_VtVAs,"If they really lay on the comedy factor and try not to make it too 'serious' like a lot of DC movies have been subject too, it may actually do pretty well. If they approach it like the way Marvel is approaching Deadpool, then I can see it have better chances of succeeding."

CmRih_VtVAs,"The last little scene was very forced to me. The military guy (from the Robocop reboot) had a terrible line delivery and Harley Quinn's response seemed made for a trailer. It's like they're trying to shove it down your throat that they're anti heroes. It's not like i was assuming they were perfect boyscout characters like Superman and had a sudden realization they aren't once she said that. OH NOW I GET IT!!!! THEY'RE BAD GUYS BUT THEY'RE SORT OF GOOD GUYS, ISN'T THAT JUST CLEVER?"

CmRih_VtVAs,"So I never heard confirmation, this R or PG-13?"
CmRih_VtVAs,WB can really throw a trailer together but dont be fooled. The man of steel was not awesome. I will keep my expectations low so i can be blown away when the film comes out.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Ahh, look at the fanboys fighting over non existent problems regarding a comic book movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I actually really really love this trailer. The Comic Con one was so serious and ominous, and this one brings to light the comedic aspects of the movie, and that's the point. They're advertising it as an action comedy, so they're presenting it in both lights. Personally, I love the use of Bohemian Rhapsody. It matches the insanity and just flat out craziness of these characters and what they collectively bring to the table. The action, 'We're probably gonna die,' part was the last trailer. This is to help highlight the comedic aspects, because with Harley Quinn, you can't predict anything."

CmRih_VtVAs,Oh and also this trailer ruined bohemian rhapsody a little bit for me :/
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope Ben Affleck's Batman is in this, even if it's a cameo. I remember seeing what looked like him in an earlier trailer during a car chase. This might be connected to the events of Robin's death prior to Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. I would also love for Harley and Joker to be involved in future DC movies now that Justice League is getting closer. Harley is the main reason I would give this a chance, Margot Robbie nails it. If I remember right, this version of her has a deep fear of Joker too, stemming from a torturous abusive history of when they were together, creating an interesting dynamic now that the two are enemies."

CmRih_VtVAs,Add some nipples and tadah..! Best movie ever

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm lovin Harly Quin right now!
CmRih_VtVAs,"i hope he will be john,,"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like they used the lame version of Harley's back story. What a shame. It could have been epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i hope he will be john,,"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like a fucking bitch if I ever saw him in the streets I would be the slightest bit of scared if I saw the one from the dark knight then I would shit my damn pants joker looks gay in this film this movie depicts everything about Harley Quinn and I feel like this movie will be filled with a dullness an empty feeling when people watch it honestly an amazing song for a stupid and over hyped movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,this will be the best DC film

CmRih_VtVAs,i dont see han solo in this movie -5/10
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that thinks this film looks way too overstuffed and just.... Bad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok time for me to make this point I see people trying to pit this against Batman v Superman I mean really?  You guys do know they are in a shared universe right? I don't even see Marvel fans doing this with their films I mean seriously sometimes I think with DC it is very clear people don't know anything about its universe and that is partially WB fault for focusing on Batman for such a LONG time than their other characters or doing BS changes in television shows ( Making Green Arrow basically Batman ripoff literally)except for Flash and I  like this trailer don't get me wrong. Finally, DC is letting go of the Nolan era film style. 

From what I see in the comments, it's rather clear a lot of people don't know anything when it comes to the DC universe besides Batman's universe and even Superman it's very suspect at best ( Superman isn't just the Donnerverse) so yes I am very skeptical to most internet fans on here when they talk about these things and this isn't about opinion it's about people having NO idea what they are talking about. I had to sit here and listen to folks bitch about Gal size has WW? Like really that is very clear NO one knows WW I mean seriously WW is supposed to look like a chick on steroids? Have you read George Perez WW? Literally Gal Gadot version they are going for. Lex Luthor lol have anyone read Birthright and seen Lex has Alexi Luthor in the Golden Age? Or Alxander Luthor Jr from Earth 3? People thinking Captian Boomerang was put in there by Batman? LOL, you do know he is a Flash villain right? Likely Barry Allen put him there NOT Batman. Enchantress is a Supergirl Villain guess NO ONE knew that huh? Or that she is also part of the Sentinels of Magic you know Dr Fate? I predicted this since DC announced there film universe I told my brother DC's real uphill battle is to transfer the audience mindset from a Batman-centric view of DC and show the DC universe is more then just Batman and Superman ( even with Superman I have to be very suspect I mean seriously some people lost me with some of the shit they said about Lex Luthor literally). Lex Luthor could be in this film I would love to see the start of the Secret Six if anything."

CmRih_VtVAs,Why are there so many dislikes.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was directed by Edger Wright
CmRih_VtVAs,Why are there so many dislikes 😒
CmRih_VtVAs,90% of the hate here comes from Marvel fans who feel their Super-Hero sitcoms being threatened by actual quality films.
CmRih_VtVAs,should we boycott it if Will Smith is in it?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wasn't excited about this movie until this trailer, which btw was perfect until the joker showed up and made me remember Jared Leto is his actor, for the love of god please let make him a Jason Todd joker and not the real deal"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please don't make Harley just a joker with tits. She was smart, emotional, she was crazy because of joker, she was a good person...she just loved joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"My wish is to kill everyone who has a negative opinion about this movie. Please, God, give me my wish!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Quueeens baby freddy mercury
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont like the trailer but i hope the movie will be better
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont like the trailer but i hope the movie will be better

CmRih_VtVAs,wow this harley is the worst one everr ._.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks really good but the music killed the vibe for me. Seems really out of place. I'll still go see it though because that's one he'll of a cast.
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont like the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant wait to show you my toys
CmRih_VtVAs,love that song
CmRih_VtVAs,Should show more respect to the lady.  :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just a bunch of whiny fanboy fucks, or haters in the comments! Shut the fuck up, it's gonna be a great movie. Marvel is great as well. This year they both win, Marvel and DC so stop bitching!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just need something cleared up, are they bad guys? The trailer was very ambiguous on that point."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen, will smith. Yes please."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is like porn
CmRih_VtVAs,Best part of the trailer is 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Best part of the trailer is 2:07

CmRih_VtVAs,Ok leto I see you. I think he can pull it off.
CmRih_VtVAs,I really wanna know who they have to fight
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer....I don't like it. Maybe cause of the song, great song but they REALLY tried to make it fit with this and I really didn't."
CmRih_VtVAs,ladies i belive dc may be comeing back to what it used to be after seeing this trailer it reminds me of the good dc comics has to offer to the world THIS IS WHAT DC SHOULD BE
CmRih_VtVAs,"This song is perfect for this trailer,I could just imagine a person listening to this song while their on a killing spree."
CmRih_VtVAs,her ass could be better but it is fappable
CmRih_VtVAs,I really wanna know who they have to fight!
CmRih_VtVAs,I really wanna know who they have to fight!

CmRih_VtVAs,damn this got me more hyped then civil war or bvs by a long shot
CmRih_VtVAs,my ears tingled when I heard Bohemian rhapsody

CmRih_VtVAs,whoever is making these trailers is fucking SICK !!!! i love how the first reveal trailer and this one has a completely different vibe to it yet they are both equally as amazing !! damn .
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know a whole lot about DC comics in general, but this looks like a mess that I would watch any day."
CmRih_VtVAs,hot Cara <3

CmRih_VtVAs,how do you guys feel about the Joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,I can tell.. It's going to be... Generically bad
CmRih_VtVAs,how do you guys feel about the Joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel disliked this
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want this to be good, but David Ayer can be really hit or miss. I hope he hits the mark with this one. Still wonder why he was chosen for this. What movie made him stand out as a potential director for this kind of film just curious"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, you win. I want to see this now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"we are bad guys, that what we do XDDD love it"
CmRih_VtVAs,biiiiiiiiiiih OMG I'm so ready for this movie to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,"Over 11 million views, and less than 5k down votes at this point. I don't normally pay attention, or give to cares about up, and down votes, but this is pretty impressive to me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker looks like Marilyn Manson dyed his hair green.
Which kinda fits when you think about it."
CmRih_VtVAs,This. Is. Fucking. Amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,biiiiiiiiitch OMG I'm so ready for this movie to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,biiiiiiiiitch OMG I'm so ready for this movie to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,"Small youtuber trying to reach 100 subs! Help me out, I make Lifestyle ~ Comedy ~ Vlogs ~ Challenges ~ And much more! Please Support me and be part of the #EarthlingArmy"
CmRih_VtVAs,My asshole is clenching in excitement
CmRih_VtVAs,H
CmRih_VtVAs,looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Literally the only interesting thing in this was Joker seemingly diving into the same vat of chemicals that created him to save Harley, which would have been really awesome to see in the theatre and not an entire year in advance online. Kind of defeated the point of your own movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait!! Jared I want to see your toys!😊
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I'm more of a fan of the animated suicide squad in Batman Assault on Arkham than this one. Harley Quinn's crazy in live action seems more made up and less convincing.
CmRih_VtVAs,when all you see is hateful comments
CmRih_VtVAs,when all you see is hateful comments
CmRih_VtVAs,"When did it become marvel vs dc? I'm a comic book fan, I don't have to like one more than the other."

CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS WAY FUCKING BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who is going to see this movie NOT for the joker and Harley Quinn? Personally, I don't like the joker's design. I didn't like it in the 60's, in the cartoon, in the dark knight rises, etc. and don't like it now. Personally I liked the joker and Harley from the arkham games for their design and character. But now, I feel like this movie is going to focus too much on Harley Quinn, and I feel like she is getting too overrated. I just want a good portrayal of the cast of characters where everybody gets a chance to shine in the spotlight."
CmRih_VtVAs,"When Rick Flag is naming everyone, Enchantress (not possessed at the time) is with him. He says ""you're possessed by a witch"" since she is standing with him. Are they together, is he helping her in some way? So many questions!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:19 gives me hope for Leto being a good Joker.

CmRih_VtVAs,"huh, this trailer actually made me happy rather than making me pissed XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well my main problem is that the joker doesn't look crazy enough on the bright side though you didn't reveal every FUCKING PLOT TWIST LIKE SUPERMAN VS BATMAN WTF WARNER BROTHERS WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR PUBLISHERS
CmRih_VtVAs,Be way cool if jokers daughter was on this
CmRih_VtVAs,So fucking excited
CmRih_VtVAs,ok
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer looks better than the others, but every single line of dialogue makes me roll my eyes.  Still not hyped."
CmRih_VtVAs,why didnt they use the people from arrow and flash?

CmRih_VtVAs,Im sooo Hype for this movie!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,We have had to all versions of The Joker :Jack Nicholson (the joker gangster) - Heath Ledger (the joker terrorist) and NOW Jared Leto ( the Psycopathic joker)....JARED is an amazing actor he will be Brilliant in this film
CmRih_VtVAs,dc's guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Another runny wet turd, fresh from the diseased rectum of Hollywood."
CmRih_VtVAs,dc's guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,"All the dialogue I've heard so far makes me cringe, Especially Harley. I'm starting to think comic book fans are just people that want to remain angsty teenagers no matter their age."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am so excited for this movie, you people have no idea"
CmRih_VtVAs,Not sure what to say about this.
CmRih_VtVAs,THATS how you edit a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,If they can keep Joker out of the spot light this could be a pretty good movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Next time a Marvel movie comes out, don't go to it.  Marvel is dead.  Bury it.  Consider this mercy."
CmRih_VtVAs,Any trailer that uses Bohemian Rhapsody as the background music automatically receives an A in my book.
CmRih_VtVAs,How the hell did this get 11 million views so fast?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ugh...Can't wait for this film to be released just to watch it crash and freaking burn. What an insult to the very characters whose namesakes are being used in this disaster waiting to happen.
CmRih_VtVAs,:D
CmRih_VtVAs,Mamma Mia! Mamma Mia!

CmRih_VtVAs,"Most of the comments i read here were just people whining...guys stop complaning so much, that's one of the biggest problems of society they are never satisfied!! just shut up man, if you don't like it, okay , you don't have to wacht the bloody movie and complaning now it's not gonna change anyhting. Another huge society's problem is not embracing changes...  they changed a bit Harley Quinn and stuff and  so what?? we should first watch the whole thing to create valid arguments then i am gonna gladly hear every single opinion and create my own!!"

CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks sick, i was a little iffy on Will Smith being Deadshot but so far he seems alright, def happy they went less cgi on croc. My only complaint is the fact that Jared Letos joker looks like some 14 year old mall rat tryna be joker, not actually the joker. And either Harleys script or the actress is god Awful, cant tell which one."

CmRih_VtVAs,looks like a great movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's watching this in 2015 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I go both ways DC and Marvel rejoice 👍👍👍👍👍👍 so many awesome movies and shows from both they are officially stepping up their storytelling with great stories that everyone will love
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody. Alright, I'll go see the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone who thinks this trailer sucked, go to your civil war trailer and jerk off to ironman crying to captain America about not being his friend :("
CmRih_VtVAs,"I will be honest, I am a huge Marvel fan but this movie looks fantastic, people are complaining that its the guardians of the galaxy of DC, sooo?? If it is like guardians than it will be awesome because guardians was amazing and this movie looks amazing as well. Like the people said in the comments, you can love both Marvel and DC at the same time."

CmRih_VtVAs,Not a mega fan of the New joker look but hey.. it could grow.. I WOULD STILL TAKE HEATH THO.
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,"some people are saying Joker is the main antagonist, Im not sure. The Kevin Smith preview had a DC rep say ""he's not *exactly* part of the suicide squad"" which implies to me that he's a supporting protagonist. some say Enchantress is the antagonist, but you hear the guy listing off member and he includes Enchantress in the list, which tells me the Suicide Squad was assembled while she was still on their side, though perhaps she betrays them and teams up with the main antagonist, whoever that may be. Based on the effects, I'd bet that the antagonist is magic based and Enchantress probably helps them"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,Lets just shut the fuck up about the huge details behind the movie and watch it when it comes out. K thanks muffin

CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that thinks this movie is going to be really bad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"As primarily a DC fan (I love Marvel as well), I want to say I'm always sick of seeing one upvoted comment on every comic movie video basically saying DC>Marvel or Marvel>DC on their respective videos. Seriously, why do you have to do that? It's really no different from religions fighting over one another. We are not that, we are fans. Liking something should not mean we should not like it's competitor."

CmRih_VtVAs,"This is how you make a trailer.

Take notes, Marvel."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto, Will Smith, Queen soundtrack and a new totally different story, shit this is going to be amazing, can't wait for it!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Jared is getting another Oscar for playing a psychological creepy bastard who doesn't give a crap about loosing his life
CmRih_VtVAs,"Upon seeing Joker Marvel Execs declared in one voice, ""FU-K!"" That's right Marvel you are through."
CmRih_VtVAs,No band beats Queen. No singer beats Freddie Mercury. Great choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn is my spirit animal. My dad showed me this, and he told I would be like Harley if I went crazier than I already am."
CmRih_VtVAs,No band beats Queen. No singer beats Freddie Mercury. Great choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel as though DC is trying too hard to catch up with Marvel in the Movie Franchise business, and they're not giving their cinematic universe the time it needs to flesh out."
CmRih_VtVAs,No band beats Queen. No singer beats Freddie Mercury. Great choice. 🔝
CmRih_VtVAs,No band beats Queen. No singer beats Freddie Mercury. Great choice. 🔝

CmRih_VtVAs,Unrealistic crap.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer itself is a work of art.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley looks perfect. Sure she's missing the dialect, but that's such a small part of the great character that is Harley Quinn. Robbie really pulled it off. And needless to say Leto did as well.

This trailer is near-perfect. We got to see the characters, the tone, and the visuals without knowing much about the plot. 9/10."
CmRih_VtVAs,And I'm a massive Hip-Hop head and I'm genuinely seeing people ask what song is being used in the trailer. Amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Basically Suicide Squad employed by Amanda Waller, mission goes up and down finally looks successful until Joker and Harley reunite and she helps Joker and betrays them. El Diablo and Enchantress to die. Hope there's still elements of darkness"
CmRih_VtVAs,davy? gameplay? rj?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bruh i love Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,I was hype for this trailer. But I was even more hype when I heard Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Film looks awesome BUT wasnt to impressed with the trailer, as someone said it doesnt reveal a lot which is good but in my opinion the music choice was crap but I am just a random Joe so who cares what I think..."
CmRih_VtVAs,i really like how the dc intro is..
CmRih_VtVAs,Now we are talking
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn looks GREAT!
CmRih_VtVAs,
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sólo esperó que sea una muy buena película, DC tiene muy buenas historias"
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone Notice that all of a sudden after this trailer people want to say DC=Marvel? Where was this last month?
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:40 lmao, he fucking dropped her. Holy shit!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney doesn't look as terrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD Warner be amazing again omg i love it

CmRih_VtVAs,what an insult to queen
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is such a good fit for the character that I didn't even notice that she wasn't using Harley's signature accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,August. FML
CmRih_VtVAs,Ayyyy lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is soooo sweet. The song was perfect for it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,I started hyperventilating when I found out that Bohemian Rhapsody and Suicide Squad were in the same trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks horrible
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks horrible

CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,August cannot get here fast enough.
CmRih_VtVAs,Not a DC fan and I think BvS will suck but this looks fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not even a comic book fan, I'm just super fucking excited for this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is really good, but at the same time it really makes me concerned. We went from super dark and gloomy to an edgy version of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Maybe it's all just marketing but it could mean we're in for a movie with a really off and inconsistent tone."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not even a comic book fan, I'm just super fucking excited for this."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think they should've had Deathstorke on here
CmRih_VtVAs,"i heard the song 
i was like Bohemian Rhapsody. 
god dammit 
its already awesome. :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn with the new 'sips tea' meme lol.

CmRih_VtVAs,Man I love this Trailer .. The music fits soooooo well :)
CmRih_VtVAs,This joker is starting to grow on me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen alone made this the greatest trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,hey
CmRih_VtVAs,qual o nome da musica??
CmRih_VtVAs,qual o nome da musica??
CmRih_VtVAs,"I actually thought this trailer was going to be much darker and quieter! However, im glad they took this approach!! Makes the character seem even more interesting."
CmRih_VtVAs,I just can't stop watching this !
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody just killed the trailer for me. Totally out of place.
CmRih_VtVAs,haus
CmRih_VtVAs,so is this gonna more of a comedy or more action?

CmRih_VtVAs,Terrible song for the trailer. Did they mean to put people off?
CmRih_VtVAs,YASSS! So fucking hyped!
CmRih_VtVAs,Pls what's the song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm tired of super hero movies, but this one...this one looks dark...could be cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey guys. We have to have a new Joker at some point. Heath Ledger is gone, so saying you wish it were his joker is pointless. I loved him as the Joker, but we've gotta realize it's time to move on and give Leto a chance"
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,now THATS how you make a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this came out the same month as Deadpool, which movie would dominate the box office?also, BADASS TRAILER!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks GREAT! I bet Harley Quinn steals every scene she's in!
CmRih_VtVAs,now THATS how you make a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks kinda like a bunch of teenagers wrote this
CmRih_VtVAs,I love bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"Predictions for box office:
Civil War - $900 Million
BvS - $1 Billion
Suicide Squad - $800 Million
X-Men Apocalypse - $700 Million
Deadpool - $600-700 Million

Let me know what you guys think! What are your predictions?"
CmRih_VtVAs,man vai toma no cu foda pra caralho !!!!!! ah e quem ta aí por causa do gameplayrj ?????
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,the theory about the joker being an old robin would actually make sense due to the fact that in this movie having lined up with batman v. superman joker would be much much older so it makes sense that he'd be so young..
CmRih_VtVAs,😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,man vai toma no cu foda pra caralho !!!!!! ah e quem ta aí por causa do gameplayrj ?????
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST. MUSIC. EVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley...
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 Just Beatiful :'D
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Perfectly synced with an amazing song>Overused Inception horns mixed with dubstep

I thought there was a scene or two that was delayed, but it was just my play back. This was synced perfectly. Take 1:30 to 1:38 for example

Also, this trailer sticks out than a lot of the rest due to the over use of the blaring horns and dubstep because they're so overused. I think its good to have like 1 or 2 out of 50 trailers being as epic as this one, add some spice instead of sugar for that extra kick if you will"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hopefully better than Guardians of the Galaxy, that movie kicked ass (my opinnion, and bad english)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Estoy tan ansioso de ver a Margot Robbie como Harley Quinzel Mamasita, cosita hermosa, bombom. Esperarla hasta Agosto que mas da."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:58
You've just spoiled the movie for everyone..."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im sorry but when Dark Night trailer was out, and i saw Heath Ledger i felt him as the joker. Watched the new trailers and jared leto still dosent suit the role."
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my fucking god I'm so pumped
CmRih_VtVAs,Haha I love the song choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,Haha I love the song choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,it still dont get me :T

CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how long before marvel tries to copy this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Que lindo Vei ;-; (Vim pelo Dxota)
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasn't looking forward to this movie until this trailer. Fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasn't looking forward to this movie until this trailer. Fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Ayyy queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks to me like they are using the story line from Suicide Squad Vol. 1: Kicked in the Teeth (The New 52), where the suicide squads' mission was to wipe out an entire stadium of 60,000 zombies and find a 'package'.  At least part of the movie seems to be that mission from what I saw of the trailer which looked a lot like the scenes from that book."
CmRih_VtVAs,"4,158 people don't want to see Joker's toys. lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,OH YES HARLY QUIN
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen - Bohemia Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,this gonna be r or pg 13?

CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it really that hard for Will Smith to wear the mask as Deadshot, so many great actor that could've played that part and they choose the one with the biggest ego."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks god awful and incredibly stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,Why must all the pretty girls be crazy?
CmRih_VtVAs,here comes everyone that's about to go to Bohemian Rhapsody and comment that this sent them

CmRih_VtVAs,looks incredibly awful stop fucking around with cannon and just fucking tell a good movie already will you
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pretty much the only time since Nolan that I've given half a shit about a comic book movie. Seriously, you all know that this is the first time in a while that one of these movies has actually looked good, maybe Iron Man is the one exception, I'm just glad DC knows Marvel's formulaic movie script is played out. Anyway this trailer kicks ass."
CmRih_VtVAs,Remember... The same people who doubted Jared Leto playing the joker also doubted Heath Ledger playing the Joker as well. Look how well that turned out.... People are always going to have an opinion smh
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys"" -The Knockoff Joker 2016"
CmRih_VtVAs,One question. If you are assembling a team of villains to kill the Joker...WHY ARE YOU INCLUDING HARLEY QUINN?! She will betray them to run back to him! She can't help herself when it comes to that psycho clown!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:19 things said by joker ... well sounds fun :p (quite lot of)

CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 Harley dies.
CmRih_VtVAs,I actually think this movie will be better than Batman vs Superman. Take from that what you will.
CmRih_VtVAs,first live action film with Harley Quinn and of course they ruin it
CmRih_VtVAs,DC tries to be fun and it actually looks like it's going to work!  This may also be the best use of Bohemian Rhapsody since Wayne's World.
CmRih_VtVAs,오오미 잼겠다
CmRih_VtVAs,오오미 잼겠다
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it me, or does this look like the DC version of Guardians of the Galaxy? Really think about it."
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 1:44 and look at the back of that thing then go to 1:58 and look at joker's back i hope jokers not that thing.
CmRih_VtVAs,This Looks Bad-Ass

CmRih_VtVAs,wacth song???
CmRih_VtVAs,wacth song???
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker even says there's always gonna be a joker... Just like the batman bs about the mantle being more than just the man. Any man can become bats vice versa same with joker.... It's so  obvious.. Just like kylo Ren was a skywalker... How yah didn't know that walking in then your an idiot....
CmRih_VtVAs,Yooo this looks dope!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Yooo this looks dope!

CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know why but my favorite scene is when Captain Boomerang cracks open a cold one.
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW SO FUCKING EDGY I'M JIZZING IN MY PANTS ALREADY BECAUSE I'M EASILY MESMERIZED BY EXPLOSIONS AND BREAKING GLASS
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST.TRAILER.EVER!!!11!!1  I will watch this movie based on this trailer alone!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara were are you
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow! just WOW! the effort  of playing queen bohemian rhapsody in this trailer, n all the scenes and editing... the toxic pool scene was AMAZING !! and 2:06 dat asS tho, lol . I'm SOLD !! I love it !!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Marvel can make Chris Evans make Captain America cool, DC can do the same to Jai Courtney and Captain Boomerang."

CmRih_VtVAs,So many idiots bashing BVS in the comments saying how this is going to be so much better. Grow up you idiots this movie is in the same universe therefore you should be hoping both movies succeed so you can have more movies in the universe.

CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is much better than the first and the tone is wayyy better now!
CmRih_VtVAs,what are they supposed to show us in july
CmRih_VtVAs,hey nerds you guys got nothin' to say 'bout 'the song'??? ...oh you are so fucked.
CmRih_VtVAs,what are they supposed to show us in july
CmRih_VtVAs,FREDDIE MERCURY♡♡♡
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is how trailers should be. DC screwed up with BvS, so now they got their act together for this one. So much better :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,COMES OUT ON MY BIRTH MONTH!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Plus David ayers makes great flicks. His use of violence will be perfect for this movie. Fury and end of watch were great.. A serious director making a serious comic book action movie. Even though this trailer is a total guardians rip
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is covering all genres.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait I thought Tom Hardy wasn't going to be in the movie no more since he quit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why the hell do they have to wait so long to release it. The movie was probably finished a year ago so why do we have to wait 6 months after the trailers come out.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:08 The T-shirt states, ""If you want peace, prepare for war"" in Latin. Illuminati? New World Order? Or perhaps it's just the movie."

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm fucking the guts out of the replay! THIS IS DOPE!
CmRih_VtVAs,He ain't the joker. Gonna be robin who got taken by real joker... Seen batman v sup trailer graffiti all over robin costume in batcave. He's to young to be real joker bats is old now. Least I'd like a twist
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly I think it should have been a tv show
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS is what the FUCK heroes movies need! YEAH!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm guessing that the joker is not on the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG THIS LOOKS AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 STRAYA!!!! ( sums it up)
CmRih_VtVAs,Never really been excited for movies........until now
CmRih_VtVAs,Just to ask where's batman during this?
CmRih_VtVAs,is Jarred Leto actually playing the joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,is Jarred Leto actually playing the joker?

Pulsating/Living tendril type things: Check.
Subway Station (Say where a virus was unleashed): Check.

Ladies & Gentleman: Alex Mercer is the Big Bad."
CmRih_VtVAs,So...Harley Quinn's lines are actually pretty lame if you'd write them out on paper. But Margot Robbie is making them more palatable with her acting. Bravo.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm Excited!!! It's so far away. I don't think I can wait!!!!!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,"eu vim pelo Davy Jones, quem mais ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Without a doubt one of the best trailers for a superhero movie (can you even call it a superhero movie?). Now all it has to do is actually be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,This joker is so fucking weird
CmRih_VtVAs,who is this motherfucker at 1:44 that looks like groot?
CmRih_VtVAs,I can now die happy
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a DC movie i want to watch
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing btw the song they play is called bohemian rhapsody by queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"i love both Marvel and DC movies that are coming out this year and the years to come, but I have a feeling DC has the better line up for this year. Just my opinion, don't crucify me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else obssessed with the scene where joker says ""I can't wait to show you my TOiiS""??"
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how DC fanboys start thinking they are better movies than Marvels when they only have trailers 😑

CmRih_VtVAs,I don't doubt Jared ability to act.  I just hate who gave the ok on his costume and makeup
CmRih_VtVAs,R.I.P DC you will not be missed for making shitty comics and movies :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so excited for this year. It's a comic book fans dream year. Deadpool, Civil War, Doctor Strange, Suicide Squad, Batman V. Superman, X-Men Apocalypse. Oh and Daredevil Season 2."

CmRih_VtVAs,"A movie about a D list comic book got 10 million views in one day, Is this the real life.. is this just fantasy.."

CmRih_VtVAs,Is beautiful to listen to Queen here .
CmRih_VtVAs,Is beautiful to listen to Queen here .
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a huge Marvel fan and I'm super pumped for this movie. Loved this way more than the first trailer. That trailer kinda sucked.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is beautiful to listen to Queen here
CmRih_VtVAs,Is beautiful to listen to Queen here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"To be honest, i dont think jared leto and margot robbie will do a great performance of joker( I found this joker very disgusting just for watching the trailer) and harley quinn for the simply fact  that their horoscopes are capricorn and cancer respectively. Most of them follow rules and has limitations; therefore, those types of characters will be better for libra, leo, geminis, sagitarius, or aries because they are natural crazy people that dont follow rules and have no limits of madness.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is beautiful to listen to Queen here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Gozei
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot can get the D I don't think I'd pull out in time 😩😁💦
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Margot Margot Margot Margot Margot Margot Margot....babyyy
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best trailers I've seen holy shit
CmRih_VtVAs,So...who are they fighting?
CmRih_VtVAs,Quem veio pelo gameplayrj?
CmRih_VtVAs,I already know jared is getting an oscar for this. Playing the joker is such an intense and complicated role...

CmRih_VtVAs,"Lame. Harley Quinn is lame, especially in this. Everyone on social media was super-hyped about this trailer, and I'm struggling to see why. Is it the music? Is it the embarassing one liners? 

I'm so tired of crazy. It's such a weak cop-out of an explanation for someone's actions, and worse,  it's very difficult to portray it on screen in a way that isn't completely cliche. It's like they cribbed Harley Quinn's dialogue from SO RANDOM teenage facebook memes and shitty glib Wal-mart T-shirts. I expect her to make a joke about  how she's not dangerous unless she doesn't have her coffee or to say ""I'm not the crazy one...maybe everyone else is crazy, MAN."""

CmRih_VtVAs,i got a feeling about this new joker. It's funny. I felt the same thing when i first saw the trailer of 2008 TDK. The moment where Heath Ledger appear as the joker. Very frightening.Same here. But Leto delivered something i never knew it was possible. I. Without a doubt. Love this new Joker. Bravo Jared Leto. You are officially my 1# favorite joker.

CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't be the only one who is watching this trailer over and over again exclusively just so we can hear Queen playing together with gun fire and what not. It even looks like this song was made for this trailer, or perhaps it was just the other way around. But whatever it was, it was an excellent choice. Whoever suggested to add Bohemian Rhapsody on this trailer should get a raise or something."

CmRih_VtVAs,who cares about this when BATMAN V SUPERMAN is coming
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like how many Haters and Marvel fanboys are bashing this trailer. If you don't like it, don't comment, don't share your opinion, just close the video and move along. Also, to those of you marvel fanboys who take the ""DC will kill Marvel"" thing seriously, grow up, same with the DC fanboys. Both companies have been around for nearly half a century and neither is going anywhere anytime soon. Just watch movies from both sides, enjoy movies from both sides,  and don't make yourself look like a fanboy or hater."
CmRih_VtVAs,"According to a partial script that was leaked on the Internet a few weeks ago(DC/Warner Bros. had it taken down), the name of the plant-like creature from the subway is ""Root"". He only speaks 3 words: ""I am Root."" And Suicide Squad will have a 1970s-1980s soundtrack. Of course, DC/Warner Bros. is denying that Suicide Squad is inspired by Guardians Of The Galaxy."
CmRih_VtVAs,WAJIB TONTON!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The most confusing part to me is Harley's hair. Like some scenes its just blonde whilst others it's coloured. I've seen the part where she's in the acid and joker comes in, but how will that fit into the movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,WAJIB TONTON!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Truth is, this Margot Robbie's casting is on the same level as Yvonne Craig and Julie Newmar. Hope the movie around her shows her potential. Almost a shame we'll have to bother with anyone else besides her and The Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why does there have to be 'sides' regarding comic book movies? I think this film looks absolutely insane, and so does BvS, but I'm equally looking forward to Civil War and Doctor Strange on the Marvel scope. 'Fanboys' should just accept that there's some sick comic book films coming out this year! No matter who's making them!"
CmRih_VtVAs,yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow. This looks absolutely amazing. And from the little snippets here and there, I can already tell Jared Leto's Joker is going to be another great one."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Been waiting for a year, the animated movie was sick lets home this is the same :) sure looks awesome !"
CmRih_VtVAs,joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Maybe it's just me, but this movie seems a bit rushed.  Think about the Avengers movies.  How many movies were there before the first Avengers movie that involved the main characters?  The backstory for each of the main members was fleshed out beforehand.  Hawkeye and Black Widow at least had cameos in one or more of the movies.  With this movie, there is no ""prequel"".  In order to be invested in the characters and actually care about what happens to them, I worry that they will have to spend half of the movie on backstory.  I'm not saying that this movie won't be a lot of fun.  It looks great.  I think that Marvel has a head start as far as this goes, and DC is trying to shove a movie with a lot of characters through the chute to make up for it."
CmRih_VtVAs,joker

CmRih_VtVAs,what is the name  of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks a total piece of shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,That Joker will be thrash
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love that they use this song, but it doesn't make the movie look as serious anymore.  I hope it's dark, like the first teaser implied.  Regardless of that, I'm still going to see it because there's a hot Asian chick in it!  Fuck yeah!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Marvel rips off their own movies.... ""I love it, my new favorite Marvel movie"".
*Other studios try something similar.... ""They're totally ripping off Marvel, fuck this""
Whats wrong with doing something similarly good? It's not like every movie is an ALL NEW ORIGINAL movie. All movies take elements from other movies that take elements from other movies and so on. Marvel seems get away with ripping off their own movies. Yes, Guardians of the Galaxy (Space Avengers), Avengers Age of Ultron (Same plot as Avengers), and Ant Man (Iron Man), I'm looking at you. Other studios get all this negative vibe, just for trying. The movie hasn't come out! If DC wants to jump on the trend and make good/fun/dark comic book inspired movies, by all means! I don't think they should be hated for trying."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Im really interested in whats gonna happen w/ the joker. He is obviously not part of the suicide squad and he never has been, so is the squad trying to stop him?? also, I'm really curious about the joker/harley relationship and whats gonna happen in this movie with them. Also, why is harley quinn sometimes wearing the *puddin* necklace and sometimes not? does this symbolize her sometimes rocky relationship with the joker and how she sometimes realizes that he is just using her? or am i just grasping at straws here idk"

CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome teaser/trailer. Kudos to whoever dreamt it up and put it together
CmRih_VtVAs,You can tell the female characters are powerful and badass because they're barely wearing any clothing.
CmRih_VtVAs,este trailer es apoteosico
CmRih_VtVAs,Is there any DC fan who can tell me what the hell is that thing at 1:44?
CmRih_VtVAs,Did you know this movie is about bad guys?!  It's about bad guys!  They're not good guys...they're bad guys!  Did we tell you it's a movie about bad guys?!
CmRih_VtVAs,That cast tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,Love Harley Quinn so much!

CmRih_VtVAs,What I like the most about this trailer is that they show us A LOT and we still know NOTHING about the fuck is happening.
CmRih_VtVAs,Reminds me of the Super Mario Bros movie....perhaps the Croc aesthetic harkens back to the goombas...SO......whose the villain?.....Deadpool? :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 The only Villain who comes to mind based purely on it's brief appearance is Prometheus.  http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Prometheus_(New_Earth)

CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto as ""The Doofus"" ... His tattoos look like iron ons from a five year old."
CmRih_VtVAs,"So I understand making a 2d animated character into a real person is difficult, but ... Harley Quinn WOULD NOT say ""We're villains, it's what we do"" because her entire story is that villains are the real good guys and victims of the heroes and she doesn't have a concept of society's rules so saying it's just what we do addresses that she is going against the norm. She should have responded with either sticking her tongue out or saying something like ""What doesn't go with my outfit?"""

CmRih_VtVAs,"I like the Killer Croc design better in the Arkham series (especially Season of Infamy). I get not wanting to overdo the CGI on one character, but they made him far too humanoid for my liking. The whole point of his character is that he LOOKS like a gigantic, man-eating, aquatic reptile with no semblance to mankind or even with society itself, and so not only is that how people have treated him in the past, but it's now how he views himself. 

Occasionally, glimpses of his fleeting humanity are shown (like when he holds doctors hostage so that they will ""fix"" him or when he becomes a leader to those who have been similarly abused or mistreated) but then he'll revert right back to his wild animal-like instincts and vow to eat everyone. And that not only makes him a tragic and complex character but also introduces the idea that he might be comfortable with that position, that he's grown to accept what others have said about him, and now he finds peace in living underwater, in the sewers and the darkness, secluded from everyone else. He could enjoy the thought of being the monster lurking in the shadows, one a unfortunate soul might stumble upon underground, right before they're devoured.

And I'm just not getting that sort of vibe from this movie. His appearance here makes it pretty hard for him to think like that. Plus, I'm gonna be pissed if Harley and Croc don't reference the fact that they're both from  Gotham!! I want some dialogue between them, maybe about how much of a tool Batman is. :)"

CmRih_VtVAs,It seems a little less sinister than i thought it might be. I'm sure it will be good fun though.
CmRih_VtVAs,with these two trailers I just watched the whole movie.  well the best parts.  lemme guess they fight the joker.

CmRih_VtVAs,To Most people saying negative things about jared as the joker needs to learn how to accept change and not dwell on the past.
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad batman approves
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how the ""villain"" hasn't been clearly defined yet. There has been speculation that Enchantress, Joker, or even Batman going against the squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,ik who quen is just never heard that song before
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone simply explain what the fuck this movie is about? I'm so confused. Is it just a load of people from comics mixed into a movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one of the only DC films I'm excited for. This and Wonder Woman. Can't freaking wait! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't really like seeing joker with earrings. Feels nothing like the joker

CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be the hardest PG - 13 ever.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Living in the times where people are going batshit crazy over comparing fictional characters and fictional universes with each other. I swear yall treat Marvel vs DC like its a fucking political crisis or someshit, people full sending death threats to each other like what the fuck. They're fucking superheros you fucking fedoras.

CmRih_VtVAs,man did I just WET myself at the finish of this trailer DAMMMNNN!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Calling it now Will Smith will ruin this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song they used
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not saying this trailer was bad at all, because I enjoyed it a lot. But if you put Bohemian Rhapsody over a guy mowing the lawn I would get goosebumps."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Didn't realize we had so many homosexuals on here. Complaining they wouldn't fuck Harley Quinn because she has ""no ass"". Lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,love that queens in thid trailer 😂😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"Are they going with the New 52 Origin for Harley? If so, what a drag. Her original origin was awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ya it does look better then batman v superman..... More crazy !!!! Thats what people love big story lines and crazy people
CmRih_VtVAs,Jada will be pissed cause Will wont be winning an oscer for this lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Scott Eastwood is creeping me out. No one should ever look that much like their father. He is a goddamn clone I swear to god!
CmRih_VtVAs,what the fuck did i just watch!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 lol that's me sneaking a soda
CmRih_VtVAs,This psycho women reminds me of Jinx XD
CmRih_VtVAs,LOVE IT!!! but.. I just wish Harley had her Brooklyn accent.. :/
CmRih_VtVAs,In one swoop I'm now looking more forward to this than Batman Vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"""He shoots people, he eats people, he burns people... And she's just crazy"" nice line"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Eh, the first trailer made me want to see it, this one doesn't. Trying to be wacky funny usually ends up being neither, first trailer had some depth to it."
CmRih_VtVAs,idk about this universe just have to wait and see
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's the Green Goblin?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, after joker jumps in for Harley, their hair dyes or something makes a heart"
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice music ;-)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Comic con teaser trailer was better, My Opinion. Movie looks amazing, that will never change my Opinion!! :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,SONG??????
CmRih_VtVAs,Mamaaaaaaa!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Execs at Marvel after watching this trailer: ""Shit."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys it's what we do."" That's my new motto thanks Harley 😇"
CmRih_VtVAs,"As soon as I heard Bohemian Rhapsody, I knew this was gonna be the shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 Joker looks like a mouse
CmRih_VtVAs,would love to watch this amazing trailer if YouTube could figure out how to f**king work
CmRih_VtVAs,J
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think jared leto gonna rule the joker tag for a long time, looks insane here, 1.23 looks terrifying man, he created his own persona of joker like ledger did, n also will smith and margot looks really cool"
CmRih_VtVAs,"> Shows best scenes in trailer
> Saves all the crap for paying customers"
CmRih_VtVAs,I dunno... I'm still not convinced...
CmRih_VtVAs,putain le joker on dirait miley cyrus bordel de merde
CmRih_VtVAs,"what the hell!!!  this is not real star trek!  Gene must be spinning in his grave!  


Oops wrong trailer sorry, or is it??"
CmRih_VtVAs,"When cap boomerang was secretly was drinking the can, I spit out my drink it was so funny for some reason"
CmRih_VtVAs,"FREDDIE MERCURY
THE BEST SINGER-PERFORMER EVER!!!
VERY GOOD MOVIE!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,joker is a joke
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still very much confused, does harley quinn join up with The Joker during the film?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is freaking art
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's Joker reminds me of the Joker in Endgame!
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer was honestly such a good move. I bet someone at DC was like, ""What if we make a fun trailer?"" and the executives were like, ""Fine, but if people don't like it, it's your fault, Jim!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad>BVS>Deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,"The music is what make this trailer awesome...


Or it's Margot Robbie ..."
CmRih_VtVAs,They got the soundtrack on point!
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so excited for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,So many fucking 10 year olds saying that bohemian rhapsody is the best song ever now god dam
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer was so good that i missed margot robbie's ass shot as 2:07 🙈😅 I'm glad it doesnt seem like harley quinn is ruined in this👌👌
CmRih_VtVAs,is it rated r
CmRih_VtVAs,We're bad guys. It's what we do.
CmRih_VtVAs,"At first I thought Suicide Squad would suck. But I admit this trailer makes me think it could actually work out pretty well. I predict people will be calling it ""Guardians of the Galaxy of 2016"".

That said, I have no intention of watching it. The vibe it presents doesn't seem all that appealing, though-I could simply rewatch Guardians of the Galaxy or see Deadpool. At least GotG took place in outer space. Suicide Squad is essentially the same setting as The Dark Knight."
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer was so good that i missed margot robbie's ass shot as 2:07 🙈😅 I'm glad it doesnt seem like harley quinn is ruined in this👌👌
CmRih_VtVAs,Warning: Don't watch this while drunk and/or high. It is a trip of which there is no return.
CmRih_VtVAs,pornhub sent me.....
CmRih_VtVAs,that looks amazing can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,love the trailer and will smith but as an arrow fan i would rather see the same actor who played deadshot on arrow in here
CmRih_VtVAs,o yeahhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,This is seriously the best music for this trailer. I am way too hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm wondering if the other two female characters are going to share the same amount of screen time as the other male characters or are they merely window dressing? They didn't seem to feature much in the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,If this movie is not rated R i am not seeing it. Making this movie pg 13 will RUIN its potential.
CmRih_VtVAs,this video like me
CmRih_VtVAs,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESSSS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😉😨
CmRih_VtVAs,"pause at 2:07
thank me later"
CmRih_VtVAs,"esta mejor el primer trailer, esta musica esta de la mierda"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 best part of the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes yes this movie needs to happen villains unite
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:06 guys, you´re welcome"
CmRih_VtVAs,esse coringa ta com maior cara de bosta de todos os tempos.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:07 Harley Qiunn sexy as ever ...real classy ...even in prison
CmRih_VtVAs,excelente combinación estoy aguardando esta película hurra!!
CmRih_VtVAs,AWWW YEAH!
CmRih_VtVAs,is that jai courtney ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith still looks like the worst part of this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,After watching this I think I'm in love
CmRih_VtVAs,Casi me da un orgasmo al escuchar bohemian rapsody :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so sad that this rising generation will be introduced to Bohemian Rhapsody by this lame trailer instead of Wayne's World.
CmRih_VtVAs,ya
CmRih_VtVAs,"attention, spoiler, the joker is robin :v"
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg i gotta call a priest after watching this, soooo awesooooome"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so good! 😭😭
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a major key to success DC will rise
CmRih_VtVAs,"not impressed, especially with the joker, i mean not because of jared or something but they made him look stupid unlike heath's in the dark knight he was scary and unpredictable."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn, more like Harley Queen. <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks better than I expected.
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know what this Trailer says?? ""Hello Marvel and Disney, we will kick your ass""."
CmRih_VtVAs,What do you think about the new Joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,"türk kahvesi, as bayrakları as as as"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this song so much....
CmRih_VtVAs,you should subscribe to my channel (its for free!!!)
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer featured Bohemian Rhapsody, and thus, was bound to be a good trailer. I, now, merely hope that the movie will be at least half as good as the song."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think everyone paused at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everybody dying to see the movie, say I!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait this is gonna be lit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:08 butt ass butt ass ass butt buttsy twatsy ass ASS ASS ASS ASS ASS AAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS! 😱🙏😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😱😱😱🙏😱🙏🙏😱🙏😱🙏🌎🙏
Best trailer ever... Of all time. 😎
# Corry in the house best anime 😑"
CmRih_VtVAs,.....LAME.....
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song name
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit this and deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,supernatural and dc fucked me up last night with these promos and trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,"R.i.p marvel sales... Oh wait, DEADPOOL. Which will be better Suicide squad or deadpool"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Song Choice. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone got goosebumps when dead shot was shooting
CmRih_VtVAs,FUUUUUUUUCK
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Stop commenting amazing music! 
Just say the name of the music."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably my favorite trailer I have ever seen.  I've been thinking about it ever sense its release and will probably re-watch it many times even after the films release!
CmRih_VtVAs,1. Why is Deadshot black? 2. Joker looks like absolute shit. 3. They destroyed Queen for me. And 4. This is gonna suck just as much as Batman vs Superman featuring 20 mins of Batman and Superman fighting and a pointless and no sense appearance of Wonder Woman.
CmRih_VtVAs,ЭТО ПОТРЯСАЮЩИЕ  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Just DC's little middle finger to Marvel.Looks amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"There is a blonde jinx!!!
*grabs popcorn*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks terrible, week plot, terrible actors playing terrible villains (except harley quinn and joker), poor dialogue, DC is too much in a hurry to make the justice league. Even Batman vs Superman doesn't look the best, doomsday looks like trash, they should of kept christian bale as batman. They need to take more time making their movies and they need to focus on getting the other justice league members, not try and make some villains vs villain trash. Especially if you got Will Smith, like really, out of everyone else, you gotta pick him. Look at Marvel, they aren't rushing out movies, they took their time, look at Deadpool, Civil War, just perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,"harley quinn is great, is that bad i think that"
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so pumped for this movie looks fricken badass
CmRih_VtVAs,More excited for suicide squad than batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why do film producers think will smith needs to be the ""tough guy "" in every film.?

 Even a paraplegic would kick his ass..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Omg!!!!! Joker doing a leap of faith, 1:56"
CmRih_VtVAs,Goosebumps is like Jumanji..perfect!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"2 of the character sin this movie were played by different actors in the Arrow series, so is the arrow series not cannon DC materiel or what?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd only watch this for Cara
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is a masterpiece! What the gods mounted it?
CmRih_VtVAs,songs that are less precise for trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,At first i was like ehh but now im like HOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,while watching this i couldnt help but think that bronson should be in there somewhere
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody!  Because it hasn't been used too much already!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that thought Margot is playing Harley terribly?
CmRih_VtVAs,"It appears that the Joker has a way bigger part than he should in the Suicide Squad... he was barely in the comics, which kind of disappoints me in that regard. Hopefully the rest of the film should redeem that, still a sad thing to see though."
CmRih_VtVAs,3 things went through my mind as I watched this.  1. bohemian rhapsody.  2. will smith?  3. SUICIDE SQUAD :-D
CmRih_VtVAs,So are they helping the good guys? Or... are they just ding all the bad things possible? and like bad guys win?
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer kept me alive today!
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh my f!$U!!)(!@g God, Jared leto is gonna be great"
CmRih_VtVAs,Still indifferent to this movie besides harley quinn i'm not enjoying the other characters much.
CmRih_VtVAs,Maybe the first Marvel movie I'll ever watch lol
CmRih_VtVAs,stupid movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,The face Joker makes as he is shooting that machine gun while wearing a suit is so fucking iconic Joker. Jared Leto definitely gets the character I think.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell freaking yeah!  Gosh damn this trailer makes me happy in my pants.  I'm seriously looking forward to seeing this movie.  And Jared Leto looks down right frightening as Joker.  Good stuff right here.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a bad feeling Harleys going to die
CmRih_VtVAs,Karmakarışık
CmRih_VtVAs,My eye holes are gettin schwifty.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 thank me later...
CmRih_VtVAs,please be rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,"First trailer comes out, and people whine that it is too dark and brooding, DC doesn't know how to be fun, they are drab, blah blah blah.

Second trailer comes out, and motherfuckers whine that it is too zany and wild, it looks like they are trying to ""copy"" Guardians of the Galaxy, blah blah blah.

I'm sorry but This trailer shows them nailing down the tone of the Suicide Squad comics PERFECTLY.

Some people are too stupid to please"
CmRih_VtVAs,Feeling conflicted over Harley Quinn. I like her portrayal but at the same time I don't.
CmRih_VtVAs,back for the thousandth time
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool gon be better IMO
CmRih_VtVAs,tom hardy would have been a better captin boomerang.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Think of a suicide squad comic book, now have it come to life, and you have this movie. This looks so accurate to the source material it's amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,FREDDIE MERCURY!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody else dislike the joker look?
CmRih_VtVAs,probably thee only DC movie i'm actually excited for. This will obviously be way better than superman vs batman. Still no super hero movie that can top Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks more like the Clown LORD of Crime!
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Putting in the ""Best videos ever"" playlist. Can't wait to see the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than the other trailers for sure
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Is anyone else getting a guardians of the galaxy vibe or am I crazy?
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this some kind of meme squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,literally crying because two of my favorite things are on this trailer: Harley Quinn and Bohemian Rhapsody iofgfviugbldiuagbvfadiimcla
CmRih_VtVAs,"Perfect choice of song :D How could anyone dislike this, it looks awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG yesssasssa!&!(!#2+1)1)
CmRih_VtVAs,Any thoughts on the villain at 1:44? I'm thinking either something to do with Poison Ivy or better yet...The Swamp Thing. Either way that would be awesome...or something completely different. All I know is 2016 is going to be a great year for movies and I can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks worse than Street Fighter
CmRih_VtVAs,"When I saw Jared I was like ""what if I wanted to brake!!!!!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,so its Joker Harley Croc Deadshot Zatanna and some other guy idk his name who is it
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker in this movie looks pretty cool cooler than Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,PORN IN MY CHANNEL
CmRih_VtVAs,the joker is gay af
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit I think my balls just exploded.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ranks high on my Summer 2016 film list :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool vs suicide squad please
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks great
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith playing Will Smith again. That never gets old.
CmRih_VtVAs,I've only researched this a couple thousands times.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The lines sounds kinda cheesy to me. But, who am I to judge? Haven't seen the movie yet. Meh."
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks absolutely insane! This is awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,"John Cena is the Worst thing Ever to happened in the wwe in History!
He cannot Wrestle or Act or Entertain.. 
Let the world know people."
CmRih_VtVAs,Im not sure I'm going to like this Harley's voice is not heavy like that
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:04 what's the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't believe people are actually going to see this pile of shit

You all have shit taste and should be ashamed"

CmRih_VtVAs,That Harley Quinn booty at 2:07 tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this is fake joker then, where is the real one at the moment?? I'm curious."
CmRih_VtVAs,excited for this and civil war! And deadpool!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevingne
CmRih_VtVAs,I really have a hard time with this joker
CmRih_VtVAs,That... Looks terrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,Oml I can't fucking wait!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,DJ 2TONE APPROVES THIS MESSAGE!

CmRih_VtVAs,OMG this looks way better than batman v superman and the joker looks soooo much more bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"Eh, I guess I'm gonna have to see the movie to make a proper judgement. Trailer doesn't impress me at all."
CmRih_VtVAs,"John Cena is the Worst thing Ever to happened in the wwe in History!
He cannot Wrestle or Act or Entertain.. 
Let the world know people."
CmRih_VtVAs,this has got to be the best trailer ive ever seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,absolutely 2 edgy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Welp, Ive spent my whole day watching this."
CmRih_VtVAs,oh! it's jinx!

CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear God, please, please, please, in the name of all that is holy, don't let this movie be a flop...."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is set after bayman V suppermam
CmRih_VtVAs,This is beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is straight up tumblr fan girl bait.
CmRih_VtVAs,i rather watch the suicide squad than watch john cena try to wrestle and entertain
CmRih_VtVAs,did I just see Harley die?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so fucking excited for this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warners!! Please!! Don't BvS this movie with another trailer. This one is magical, brilliant. We are all hyped. We are all going to give you our money. Please, don't fuck this up, don't show us more. 
I know you want to release another trailer, so that my grandma and her dog go see it as well. But they don't care, and they wont care even if you show the entire freaking movie in 2 minutes. I beg you. So far everything was great. The trailer, the posters. Don't fuck this up."
CmRih_VtVAs,So... Is El Diablo still useless and expendable..? And Slipknot hit s girl! Not cool man! But seriously is Clint Eastwood agent Grayson... Like I can't not see it
CmRih_VtVAs,"pronto, já assisti o filme."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn bad af
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank god it wasn't like the Batman v Superman trailer and ruin the whole movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"The hell is wrong with you people? 
We all leaned a lesson from Batman for sure."
CmRih_VtVAs,take out the joker and ill see it
CmRih_VtVAs,"it's weird seeing Will Smith play dead shot only because im used to the guy in Arrow, but this looks really good."
CmRih_VtVAs,*goose bumps
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I need to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,i liked the first trailer better lol
CmRih_VtVAs,genuine question: y isn't poison ivy in suicide squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,I love DC and Marvel. This year will be amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rapsordy fits with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this is what I'm talking about 😃 This is actually a good trailer for this movie unlike that boring over dramatic first one
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst heroes ever lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm really anticipating this film and I've watched this trailer about 50 times already I'm so exited!
CmRih_VtVAs,harley got dat ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,They're trying too hard with The Joker it seems. And They should've kept Harley's color scheme Red and Black.
CmRih_VtVAs,At least one of DC's movies this year won't suck
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dawg....
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT STOP CRYING. ITS SO FREAKING  AWESOME.
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song in the beginning?
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this ends up being the DC version of Guardians of the Galaxy, I will so happy! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,soundtrack?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I already don't like this interpretation of Harley. They should have just tried to write her based on their own interpretation (they've already taken so many liberties with this movie, what's one more?), rather than trying to go for that comic feel. Her humor doesn't come across nearly as well here as it does in the comics."
CmRih_VtVAs,thumbs up if Harley Quinn looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"First, it was Wayne's World to use this song in a trailer, and now it's Suicide Squad.  ...God, I love movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,<3
CmRih_VtVAs,Ugh..... What the hell is Will Smith doing here. PG 13. God damn it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally! A trailer that didn't ruin a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm calling it now. Clint Eastwood 's kid is nightwing undercover.
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian raphody - Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,this is like guardians of the galaxy in the present
CmRih_VtVAs,What happened to no jokes Warner Bros?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is pure perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,Watching this while taking a shit 😂😂then realizing this movie is the shit and the shit your taking is nothing 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol why are everyone putting a boundary between these two films that came from DC? They're starting the universe who started the superhero genre, Superman and another hero who also became the grandfather of the superhero genre, Batman with the most iconic female superhero, Wonder Woman and all three of them will finally start the Justice League and DC has the first all villain movie and trailer is different because they are villains and in BvS its serious because they are superheroes and being a superhero is not at all fun and games, its a huge responsibility and it will not be a typical superhero movie. Everyone should be old fashioned, enjoy the movie and dont let other people think for yourself"
CmRih_VtVAs,like
CmRih_VtVAs,Killer Croc for the win.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm calling it now: slip knot, el Diablo, Rick flag and the enchantress die. Kitana and croc in the middle. Harley and Deadshot won't die."
CmRih_VtVAs,sólo esperó que la película no sea una tontería con tremendo temazo!
CmRih_VtVAs,How many 'Suicide Squad brought me here' comments are on Bohemian Rhapsody right now?
CmRih_VtVAs,not impressed...
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that thinks people are over reacting to this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Deathstroke?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I expect a couple of good performances, but the trailer looks like shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to be a super heroe
CmRih_VtVAs,omgg mannn whatttttt yeeaahhhhhhhsudnx
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the most cringiest thing I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why aren't I in this? .....oh wait....soo neckbreaking
CmRih_VtVAs,love it
CmRih_VtVAs,BA!
CmRih_VtVAs,there are people who hate this??? O.o
CmRih_VtVAs,wow.... just.... wow...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one that feels Bohemian Rhapsody doesn't really fit the trailer? I love Queen but I just feel like between this trailer and the first one released, it was two different movies. Especially since the first one was shown as so dark...."
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07, you're welcome (:"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sorry but Bohemian Rhapsody is a masterpiece and should never be played on stupid movie trailers.
CmRih_VtVAs,harley Quinn reminds me off Barbra Dunkleman (if that's how you spell it) from Rooster Teeth.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cause nothing really matters
CmRih_VtVAs,I like this woman
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,is it just me or does the dialogue seem really really bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,"hahahahahahaha aaawesome traileeer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!00.28, 01.09, 01.23 deadshot, harley, joker expressions... sold me!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I haven't watched Wayne's World in a long time.
CmRih_VtVAs,Must watch movie for 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,holy moly
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck yes
CmRih_VtVAs,"couldn'ta done it better. queen, explosions, and bad guys. that's how you make someone psyched for a movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really hope that Harley Quin is an actual character and not just a 2 dimensional ""crazy chick"" stereotype"
CmRih_VtVAs,Favorite movie and it didn't even come out yet
CmRih_VtVAs,What is that in the subway at 1:47 ? anyone knows?
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone needs to chill. Sure they had comedy. But it was dark humor. This trailer was dope but had a different approach so stop assuming
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ummm, no. Trying way too hard. The overused Queen tune doesn't help either..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that thinks Jai Courtenay looks exactly like Tom Hardy here?
CmRih_VtVAs,harley Quinn has prioritys
CmRih_VtVAs,Movie got very interesting with Bohemian Rapsody 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bend over, girl...."
CmRih_VtVAs,who cares
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks cool
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that they should carry on the original harley quinn voice
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't believe that Harley used to be a psychiatrist then later she turns into a psychopath...
CmRih_VtVAs,like for awesome :3
CmRih_VtVAs,nice
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like the dude @ 0:18 is going to make this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still banking on them fucking up the joker, seems they did it."
CmRih_VtVAs,ooooh shit just got real!!! As in Queen real
CmRih_VtVAs,Hmm wow.This is different
CmRih_VtVAs,"So they make the movie look even worse than it already did with a trailer?  And most importantly, they didn't give Harley Quinn her amazing voice and just a regular voice? Wtf...  I want to like this movie, I was stoked when I heard about it, but have been one let down after another with each new reveal."
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the book what Harley is reading?
CmRih_VtVAs,TMI
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why are people mad at Margot Robbie voice when their only frame of reference is a damn cartoon...LOL

Alot of nerds in here"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hype! READY!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one that's bothered by Harley's voice? I don't know, maybe it's just me..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this harley quinn yay
CmRih_VtVAs,"as someone who grew up with movies containing copious amounts of CGI I was always disappointed with DC movies. Then came Watchmen and V for Vendetta and then I was like yeah then here come the justice league... and then I was pretty satisfied with Superman Returns, but no follow up. Then came Christopher Nolan kicking ass and taking names for DC and now I'm curious. I'm hooked. Man of Steel was just the icing on the cake. Can DC create an epic cinematic universe? Is this what I've been waiting for deep down inside?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Enchantress 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,I am more excited to see this movie than batman v superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:18

Beautiful"
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song
CmRih_VtVAs,Who the hell choose song for this tralier??
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, never really followed any DC things, save for the movies and the few animated series of Batman when I was young. With my limited DC knowledge, I've had several problems with the castings of this movie, the biggest being Jared Leto.
Now, after the trailer, I've less problems with the casting. Except for Jared Leto. Other than this iteration of the Joker, I'm kinda looking forward to Suicide Squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 me in class trying to sneak in food
CmRih_VtVAs,1:31 smoke that looks like skulls? Thats like straight out of a comic book haha.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn so cute. <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Its like X-men on crack~ Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys""
- Perfect"
CmRih_VtVAs,"it looks cool, but it sorta is ripping off the whole batman universe in one movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I still dont like this new joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Damnit now this may be a good DC movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen, the soundtrack to our lives...generation... after generation... :-D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs up for Harley's ass in those booty shorts. Daaaaaaaaammmmmm.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG!!!! I can't wait! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh i love the joker and harley in this!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Absolutely amazing trailer, so shocked for it!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,once i heard bohemian rhapsody on i didn't even care about the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"3,600 killed by Mr. J & Harley Q... and counting!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kinda disappointed in this trailer, Harley doesn't sound like Harley, Joker's look is weird, and when they put ""Worst Heroes Ever"" it came off as a comedy. Hopefully the actual movie is much better than the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Generic song choice, generic Will Smith acting, they're milking the joker look, wrecked city cliche and I have a feeling villains ending up as heroes is huge cliche. I call it Fast Food Film: it makes me sick when I watch it."
CmRih_VtVAs,imo this trailer is better than the second bvs trailer but that doesnt mean its going to be better
CmRih_VtVAs,Bo Rap completely fits this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith and Margot Robbie together again. praise.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this all original? Or some Batman spinoff?
CmRih_VtVAs,you can just tell Harley Quinns going to be the badass ..
CmRih_VtVAs,"At 0:53 - 1:04 did Harley Quinn had a Pinkamena-esque moment?
Now I'm excited to see this film!"
CmRih_VtVAs,No Bane
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone is hating on it because of man of steel this is not Zack Snyder its David Ayer give him a chance and stop complaining it's so annoying
CmRih_VtVAs,Not really feeling Harley in this trailer but I'll wait for the actual movie to judge :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks awesome IMO.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best movie tailor i seen in a long time...

Ill be covering best movie tailors of all time on my youtube channel soon :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,loooovvee itt
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else annoyed with Will Smith playing the same ""calm-tough"" guy act in every god damn movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,No cabe duda que este año habrá películas muy buenas que ver.
CmRih_VtVAs,where do I send my money?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,My 5th time watching this trailer today and it has kept me so giddy like a 5 year old on christmas.
CmRih_VtVAs,I still want to know more up about commen character tattooed man I think that's him subway destroying the train
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait!😵🙄
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is EPIC. kudos to Warner brothers, I mean daaaaaamn."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 looking forward to this movie !
CmRih_VtVAs,got the chills!! letos gonna prove everyone wrong 😎
CmRih_VtVAs,Que culo el de la Harley jajaja esta buenota ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"1 like - KISS YOUR CRUSH
1 sub - FUCK YOUR CRUSH
Ignore - NEVER FUCK YOUR CRUSH"
CmRih_VtVAs,She's the perfect Harley Quinn though.
CmRih_VtVAs,at 1:58 when Jokers in the chemical liquid with Harley Quinn the acid is in a shape of a heart!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not sure how I feel about the actress playing Harley something just isn't quite right but I can't really judge based on one trailer will need to wait to see the full movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"With the sword at 1:31, there's actually skulls visible in the smoke coming off of it. Just thought that was cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,Name of the song plz!
CmRih_VtVAs,waiting for the premiere
CmRih_VtVAs,who else paused it on Margot Robbie's booty
CmRih_VtVAs,When Joker pull Holly out the green stuff if you look at the red and blue it makes a heart
CmRih_VtVAs,"This feels like GOTG but with villains, should be great"
CmRih_VtVAs,What makes this trailer so much better than Batman v Superman is the fact that they haven't revealed the entire plot in one go. In this case less is more.
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto looks average.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love the trailer. adding queen gave it a dark-but-fun sense of humor to it. Am I the only one who really isn't digging Margo robbies performance? idk what it is, but her last line made me cringe a little"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that suppose to be jokers' brother??
CmRih_VtVAs,"From the trailer, I can say that I don't like Harley here...She isn't...funny and insane how she should be."
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome it's a new Guardians of the Galaxy trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Im getting sick of these super hero movies but this one has a nice spin on it...also Will Smith is almost an automatic win in everything he does.                                                                                                                                   https://www.mixcloud.com/Tom_O/spiritual-reset/
CmRih_VtVAs,"Disappointed in this trailer, it'll still be a solid superhero movie, however it felt with the other one that they were going for a gritty approach. I have no problem with action comedy but I thought they were going to be more ambitious. Also, Bohemian Rhapsody, of all the songs to pick, such crap."
CmRih_VtVAs,this would make sense if this time place a year before MoS
CmRih_VtVAs,"so I have this and Deadpool to look forward to! 
i'll watch this one because of sexy harley and Will Smith is the man!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks great!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Came for Suicide Squad, stayed for Queen"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know which is worse, this trailer or the sexually confused fanboys that crawl out of the woodwork every time someone posts a negative comment about it."
CmRih_VtVAs,the best song EVER made this trailer better than any other trailer i have ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet! Love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer imitated Age of Ultron
The second imitates Guardians of the Galaxy
DC is starting to look like that fat, nerdy kid in school who tried to copy other kids in a sad attempt to make himself more popular"
CmRih_VtVAs,DCs version of Guardians of the galaxy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:08 when in doubt, pinky out"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 chills
CmRih_VtVAs,"Didn't like Harli's voices joke, just wasn't that funny, but EVERYTHING else looks phenomenal! A promising Deadpool movie and this in the same year. WHAT?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Film for stupid kids !
CmRih_VtVAs,"se ve que estará muy buena la película,  una de las que espero más este año"
CmRih_VtVAs,"question, is ""REAL 3D"" any different than 3D? lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,i knew they were gonna make this tralier
CmRih_VtVAs,"whit that harley quinn , is going to be very veryyy boring."
CmRih_VtVAs,This joker is not as good as me
CmRih_VtVAs,"After a dangerous mining operation, It seems DC has discovered the rare ore known as comedy. Little is known about this new mineral, but experts believe that there are plans to use this to entertain people. More information coming soon as DC experiments....."
CmRih_VtVAs,League of Legends! ;o
CmRih_VtVAs,"So the movie is PG-13 and only one F-bomb can be dropped...  So I say this is FUCKING AWESOME! 
My dog this is definitely going to give Batman V. Superman and Civil War a run for their money."
CmRih_VtVAs,the wait is way too long
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel Or DC?
CmRih_VtVAs,"a great trailer need a great song, and Fuck Yeah, Bohemian Rapshody is the right onee!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,was that meant to be the joker =D
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 your welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,Who would have ever thought we would see Captain Boomerang in a movie before The Flash?
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank god they put joker in a suit. No offense to Jared Leto but joker is an ironically fancy dressed meth head looking fiend not a dumb silver grill no shirt thug.. Thank you for straightening that shit out.. Now if Harley Quinn was actually funny and ironic not sassy and weird.. Oh well I guess they always have to draw the line somewhere between a perfect experience and just mildly above average. Sad really.
CmRih_VtVAs,Aww bohemian rhapsody❤️looks like a funny ass movie too
CmRih_VtVAs,in the scene where he is listing off the members of the suicide squad he says you are possessed by a witch when talking about the enchantress and then u went back and checked and she is the girl behind him before he starts listing off the names. Why is she out of her cell and she does not look crazy what is going on with that. also you can see that when the joker is dipping Harley in the acid you can see her hair die which makes me guess that it happens after they are out on there mission very interesting.
CmRih_VtVAs,Came here for Cara and Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,"*opens video
*hears bohemian rhapsody
That's it I'm sold"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:47 DEATHSTROKE!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is getting overplayed
CmRih_VtVAs,This is easily my favorite trailer of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn fans UNITE
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED TO FUCKING SEE THIS MOVIE.
CmRih_VtVAs,wow was not expecting such a badass trailer this movie is looking juicy captain america what?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't see why ppl r angry I'm glad their going for a more comedic route I mean think about could u really take this team seriously (especially with Harley Quinn) I think the idea of villains teaming up sounds real cool
But right now my biggest issue is that some ppl r calling this childish how is the tone in any way childish (other than the song ) I'm not trying to defend this movie I'm just saying we should wait before drawing conclusions"
CmRih_VtVAs,villains are much better than heroes
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,look like poor Coldplay
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so DC ..
CmRih_VtVAs,eu virei astronauta
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY QUIIINNNNNNNNNNN 💕💕💕💗💗💗💗💓💓❤❤❤❤😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone notice Harley Quinns ass at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,perfect yeaaaaaaaaaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just to put Bohemian rhapsody doesn't mean wich this film will be good, fuck off fanboy's"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley so adorable *_*
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody? For real?
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't mind will smith but bad choice for this movie. Could of gotten someone better
CmRih_VtVAs,the sick joke is bad that's back
CmRih_VtVAs,....I'm not sure what to think ....I think I'll have the same opinion of this as I do the new starwars ...there's parts that I love ..and there's parts that I don't ...I love the crazy insane clown we call joker ...what is this new gangster joker( I like Jared leto tho!)  ?? I'm not sure I'll love it ...and what I saw on this video ...Harley (margot robbie)didn't seem Harley enough for me...love the outfit tho ...now will smith as deadshot ! I'm excited for ....I just hope he can live up to the dead shot quota. but I've loved everything will smith does. well we will have to just find out. weather or not I like or dislike anything it will still be a good movie .....just as a DC fan will I like it ?
CmRih_VtVAs,i cannot have enough of this in my life
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the girl harley quinn 
CmRih_VtVAs,doesn't look too bad
CmRih_VtVAs,sooo my bike's name is Rhapsody wooohooo
CmRih_VtVAs,0:01 Already love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"What was that? I should kill every one and escape? Sorry it's the voices, nah just kidding.... That's not that they really said"
CmRih_VtVAs,If Bohemian Rhapsody is the soundtrack the movie must be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg I cant wait for this movie!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"ah finnaly, colorfull"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen! Fuck Yeah!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I made a fan version with 'Crazy' by Gnarls Barkley. The song matched up really quite well as the clip stood, with some minor edits. I think it's more fun, if you prefer that to the darker tones in the official trailer. (And why won't Youtube let me paste the link?) Oh well, just look at my channel."
CmRih_VtVAs,Poor choice in using that song... I love that song... But didn't fit at all...
CmRih_VtVAs,SOOOO Dope!
CmRih_VtVAs,Min 2:08
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel thank you for open DC eyes with guardians of the galaxy ...
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the military guy is Scott Eastwood right? Who is he playing?
CmRih_VtVAs,Almost 3 million in two days dang!!!! Everybody loves crazy people lol
CmRih_VtVAs,My emotion was for Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the execution.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wher is Iron man ?
CmRih_VtVAs,this film will have sex scenes ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i want to kill myself
and i want the person responsible for this to drown in acid"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 One of Poison Ivy's vines?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I felt good after watching this, does that make me insane? xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"-It says August 5th. That means they made a trailer for us to wait pretty much a year to see the actual movie. BS

On the upside it really does look like a good movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,The new avengers is looking great!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so much better than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,"Absolut amazing trailer! Yeah, looks very good!"
CmRih_VtVAs,great thanks for ruining Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Han Solo dies in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 2:30 that ass
CmRih_VtVAs,August? Are you fucking serious?
CmRih_VtVAs,is the asian girl ninja a bad guy?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 nice
CmRih_VtVAs,Also not sure how Freddy Mercury would feel about this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Stop at 2:08, you can thank me later"
CmRih_VtVAs,is joker a good guy?
CmRih_VtVAs,New joker sucks!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking forward/not looking forward to this
CmRih_VtVAs,It's going to be so bad. But I'm going to enjoy it anyways haha.
CmRih_VtVAs,GAAAH I CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg, i'm a marvel fanboy and i'm amazed"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey if its the worse heroes where is Deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,"It was an alright trailer I guess. The trailer so far doesn't make me want to see it right now. Sure I would see it but it's not because of the trailer. I think Jared Leto could have done a better Joker laugh imo the one they have in this trailer is meh. If you compare the laugh to all of the ones out there Ledgers and Hamils are better.

With all that said the film looks alright, Quinn sadly doesn't seem to sound spunky enough like in other venues. I can wait until there are other trailers for this in the future."
CmRih_VtVAs,watching this ll better then watching man in a blue tights
CmRih_VtVAs,"Have to say, somewhat disappointed"
CmRih_VtVAs,"A group of characters that not many people know of, is  becoming a movie? Sounds familiar."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes
CmRih_VtVAs,that was the first trailer i enjoyed watching in like a year!
CmRih_VtVAs,harley💞💞
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now my most anticipated Super Hero movie of the year. Not sold with BvS but this looks great. Might just be that one of my favorite songs is in the trailer though. But much better than the first trailer, bravo DC bravo."
CmRih_VtVAs,i wanna go see this but im afraid there might a terror attack at the theater..
CmRih_VtVAs,Stolen name from +Capguntom
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody :3 Perfectly Used!
CmRih_VtVAs,Its so weird seeing the Toronto buildings.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate everyone at work right now I just need 2:30 minutes to watch this and everyone and their freaking mother needs help right now
CmRih_VtVAs,"Goddamn it why did they have to direct it at children. For once I want to see a Rated R, grimy, creepy, scary superhero movie without the childish humor."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Id push Harley Quinn up n down the Axminster for an hour or two. LOL.
CmRih_VtVAs,"There is a disturbing lack of Deathstroke in this trailer. It's gonna be an awesome movie, but come on where is he?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it just me, or when we get to the ""Beelzebub!"" part of the song, we see Enchantress. This is probably because she is possessed by a witch, or am I just looking to far into this?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well batman vs superman just lost its spot for most excited DC film
CmRih_VtVAs,Im starting to believe that this is going to be better than Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker is deff going to be the main protagonist in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how they gave joker fake teeth, like he's been punched in the face by batman so many times they all got knocked out"
CmRih_VtVAs,Beautiful trailer. Didn't expect less.
CmRih_VtVAs,For my Jai Courtney Fans who else was jumping around and did anyone noticed when he opened the soda priceless I laughed so loud OMG 😂😂😍😍😘😘
CmRih_VtVAs,Iam watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,My mom said if i watch the trailer one more time she'll bash my head with the keyboaryreffsyfbkluwsvjufddhsdbkdgcshxs
CmRih_VtVAs,This summer is going to be great
CmRih_VtVAs,This has genuinely made me moist.
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,How is this better than Batman vs Super? Looks like a Guardians of the Galaxy trailer with different cast members.
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song na... Nah I'm just kidding XD *Insert Joker Laugh*
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto se ve como Marilyn Manson
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't care what anybody says this joker looks wayyy better. Nice and Rapey
CmRih_VtVAs,Did everyone singalong when they heard queen ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Eva green would make a perfect enchantress
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will smith conseguiu baixar a qualidade do filme com a frase "" vamos salvar o mundo "" kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fans: Give us something amazing
DC: Say no more"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like this will be my birthday present
CmRih_VtVAs,Holder <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"This shit is going to blow Batman Vs Superman out the water... I never expected it, but I think it is. The trailer is just more appealing and doesn't reveal to much."
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadshot died in the Arrow but I guess he's in this universe as well.
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song called
CmRih_VtVAs,The 1 second clip with the helicopter is the coolest thing I have ever seen in my life
CmRih_VtVAs,"had to watch it 15 times, it was unbelievable squeal*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"In this trailer I just realize how much Harley Quinn looks like Emilie Autumn I mean look at her she's crazy, she has a tatoo with the shape of a heart in her right cheek and she drinks tea like a british but she's more american than an hamburguer.

Anyway this trailer give me some hope about the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK YEAH DC
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably from this movie i will like Will Smith better
CmRih_VtVAs,Superheros are gay as shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK... I WAS EXPECTING ACTION, THRILLER, COLOR. BUT WHAT DO I GET.? ... SHITE!"
CmRih_VtVAs,So happy when i saw the trailer then i see August 2016 i was like wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought deadshot dies in this movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,I forget is this a movie or a TV show
CmRih_VtVAs,why does the Joker have a face?? this makes no sense.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love Will Smith but, why cant the one guy who played Dead Shot from the Arrow be in this movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,is this DC version of deadpool? and guardians or the Galaxy LOL
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is Jared Leto the joker they should've used some who's less ""censored for ppl of 2015-2016"""
CmRih_VtVAs,W.T.F.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad better than Batman v Superman, why ?
because."
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, at least: 'Young internet' will check out: What's a Queen? :-D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Uhm...WTF is Marvel's Orb doing in a DC Movie? ( 1:22 )
Is that an intentional ""F!@# You"" from DC to Marvel?"
CmRih_VtVAs,well.... I just jizzed
CmRih_VtVAs,"Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,so can't wait for this to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG!!!! August needs to hurry the f*ck up!!!!!!! T.T
CmRih_VtVAs,Marggot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn but her voice and the fucking idiotic lines they give her don't seem like Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,1:34 how kit kat commercials be like
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF is this...worst trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to hold Margot Robbie and not let go.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is deadshot black
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh yeah BTW people shut up it is going to be a good film 😡
CmRih_VtVAs,"All of the characters look so terrible though, Killer Croc, The Joker, Harley Quinn."
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,At the 1:44... Shade the Changing Man?
CmRih_VtVAs,Im watching this film just because of the song used in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA???
CmRih_VtVAs,According to this trailer Jared Leto is going to be so fun and awesome and terrifying playing the Joker in this movie!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,ANOTHER ONE!
CmRih_VtVAs,My dad worked on thAt movie😀
CmRih_VtVAs,Joel for the win. Finally some recognition.
CmRih_VtVAs,My excitement for Leto's Joker grows with every reveal.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,DC IS fucking amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,I am very exited for this movie. I love jarred Leto as the joker and how Cara Delevingne is proving she is not just a pretty face and is stepping into the acting world.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone notice the heart around Harley and the joker in the chemicals
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not that big on D.C. movies but this looks really really dope
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara and Margot
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen > SUICIDE SQUAD

CmRih_VtVAs,"I aready want to 
see it"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This song goes so much better with the theme of the movie!!! And don't even get me started on how hot Harley Quinn is looking in the end of this trailer......

BOiNG!!! Nerd Boner!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,yay my 2 favorite things in this
CmRih_VtVAs,надоели эти выдуманные герои
CmRih_VtVAs,I aready want ro see it
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited finally a movie about the best bad guys and the trailer is better thanks to bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,pleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuckpleasedontsuck
CmRih_VtVAs,Like the guy as Rick Flag but we all know Tom Hardy would of been a Beast in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cadê os BRBRBRBR???!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a Queen fan and am so damn sick of this song.
But god did it work brilliantly in this trailer. Holy hell."
CmRih_VtVAs,"hey guys, just made a new gaming channel! Please take a look and subscribe if you like the content! Thanks!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Flagg will die and the Squad will avenge his death.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome trailer. Bohemian Rhapsody makes everything better.
CmRih_VtVAs,This just looks terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,"""75 cents is 75 cents. I'm supposed to throw away money?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everybody is afraid they'll reduce Harley to nothing more than a girl, but I think this will cement her as even more than any steryotype"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it me or does it look like Harley Quinn dies in this one and comes back via lazarus pit at 1:59. If so betting money due to there being multiple pits the movie may be about them. just food for thought. Yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone got goosebumps while watching this? 
CmRih_VtVAs,rated what??
CmRih_VtVAs,hola a todos
CmRih_VtVAs,Well Marvel has some serious competition...
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm confused wats is the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I just came...
CmRih_VtVAs,"From the Trailer's I've seen Margot plays a terrible Harley, I hope the movie makes it better, what a terrible rendition."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Over 7+ million views in 19 hours? HOW???

Anyway, so excited for this movie! August ca't come soon enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking shit balls DC you got a good looking movie . August cant come fast enough
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else notice the punisher reference on the shirt at 2:07 or is it just me?
CmRih_VtVAs,that fucking coke skank supermodel girl is an actress now? did she put taylor swift video on her resume? pffffft!
CmRih_VtVAs,This's gonna be the best dc movie since the dark knight
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watch the trailer 43 times and still enjoying it...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was disappointed. I thought this was going to be dark and dramatic, but it just looks like a cheesy comedy with a bunch of silly one liners."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks decent enough. The writing wasn't great here, but I feel like every line was delivered about as well as it could be."
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF is wrong with those ppl downvoting?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anybody comparing this to Guardians of the Galaxy is really not thinking straight, sorry to be mean but it is what it is. I guarantee this movie will not have Batman dancing to defeat the Joker. Also if you feel like the team aspect is what makes it similar just know that Suicide Squad in the comics has always been about implanting bombs in criminals heads to do government jobs while the Guardians of the Galaxy in the comics was formed by Starlord to protect the galaxy after the Phallanx attack. Nova Corps never put that group together so the movie actually copied the Suicide Squad formula.


Also Guardians of the Galaxy is def not the first movie to include rock. Maybe the little kids discovered old school rock there but not the rest of the world."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was a big criticizer at the start, and though the trailer has changed my mind a little, my three biggest complaints still stand. Harley still looks and sounds nothing like the comics, Croc was a bad choice all around when they could have literally turned him blue and made him a more canon, more interesting King Shark. And finally, Joker still looks ridiculous."
CmRih_VtVAs,Everybody seems fine. Except Harleyis badly cast and Killer croc is ugly af.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So this is a collaboration of tthe thing and torch from fantastic 4, The joker and Harley Quin from batman, reptile from Mortal kombat, and the bald dude from about all the avengers movie... Seems freaking sick!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I gotta say , this is Far more Greater than Deadpool :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst joker if that is him
CmRih_VtVAs,so its a comedy
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Is this the real life?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,eu preciso ver essa obra do cinema
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, is this DC's version of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy? I'm not convinced."
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling it's gonna be rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,wow this movie looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see it!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,More spoilers than Star Wars
CmRih_VtVAs,the funny part is that this movie could air on cn
CmRih_VtVAs,For some reason I find Harley Quinn really hot
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney finally found a role he'll excel in. Sneekily drinking a beer.
Really being Australian"
CmRih_VtVAs,Aaaaand pause at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,KATANA OML
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MY BABY JESUS RIDING A MYTHICAL DONKEY WITH 27 NIPPLES WHILE SHOVING TURD BACK UP IT'S ASS FLYING THROUGH THE CLOUD HOPING TO MEET THE COW ON THE MOON TO SAY THE CONDOM BROKE LAST NIGHT THIS IS AWESOME.
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the second song from queen calledin this trailer?(name pls)
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared leto is going to ruin this movie for me..seriously
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer i seen in years !!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,It's got Cara got to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh hell yes!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I don´t know about harley quinn. she just dosn´t feel... unstable enough. The joker didn´t get much of an appearance but from what I saw he feel wonderfully psychotic.
CmRih_VtVAs,la puta... MADRE :V
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is so creative as the gunshots matched the beats of the song, great! I bet this will outnumber Batman Vs Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome af. I can't wait till this comes out.
CmRih_VtVAs,THE GREATEST TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,Actually interested now.
CmRih_VtVAs,well Will Smith is just gonna ruin this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I still think deadpool is better
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto better not fuck this up
CmRih_VtVAs,""" I can't wait to show you my toys""  lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,This was at 6 million views about 3 hours ago fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,The music fail for this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"will smith and margot robbie again? hope they bang, but Harley is still queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,Буду ждать!👍
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the wichs name
CmRih_VtVAs,great using of Bohemia..... :P
CmRih_VtVAs,That looks fucking tremendous
CmRih_VtVAs,Isnt Katana good?
CmRih_VtVAs,What about this is like Guardians of the Galaxy ? Because they were in jail before becoming a team ? In the comics the Guardians didn't even form like that Starlord created a team of heroes to protect the galaxy where the Suicide Squad in the comics has always been about Amanda Waller hiring( more like forcing) criminals to do jobs. So in actuality the Guardians of the Galaxy movie stole the Suicide Squad formula. Does the music make it more Guardians like ? People act like Guardians of the Galaxy was the movie to invent rock and roll or the first movie to include rock.
CmRih_VtVAs,They probably put all the punchlines of the movie in the trailer x'D
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 is harley dead...?
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing trailer tough I expected a harley quinn childish voice
CmRih_VtVAs,You know from the thumbnail that the dude with the tattoos ( the one with the flames) dies.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fairly sure about 280,000 of the views of this trailer are mine."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who paused at Harley's ass?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen! 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is trying way to hard to be cool. Its embarrassing.
CmRih_VtVAs,YASSSSSS THEY PLAYING MAH BAES QUEEN!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm kind of excited to see the Joker in this but I was kind of hopeful that the Joker's daughter would be in it instead tbh.
CmRih_VtVAs,lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who really excited about Enchantress and Katana???
CmRih_VtVAs,They should have made Margot Robbie do the voice
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this to come out!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,WAT SONG IS IT?????? AND DONT U FUCK WITH ME GIVING ME A DIFFERENT SONG YOU YOUTUBE TROLLS I NEEED TO KNOWWWWW
CmRih_VtVAs,This is literally one of the best trailers I've seen in a long time.  Way better than Batman V Superman.  Excitement = uncontrollable
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG
CmRih_VtVAs,holy fuck...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, while watching the video press 1 over and over again. Never-ending push-ups."
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbnail: When the squad crashes the wrong party but stays because reasons
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't like this trailer, and quite frankly I don't think the movie will be good. If my previous statement offends you, please grab a feeling band aid and patch yourself up."
CmRih_VtVAs,i like bohemian rhapsody good song for a action movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"How nice of the Joker to baptize Harley, he really has Christian motives guys"
CmRih_VtVAs,i love you dc.  :')
CmRih_VtVAs,So this film is gonna be comedy like Guardians of the Galaxy? Oh no -.-
CmRih_VtVAs,CANT WAIT TO SEE IT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Remember when the guardians of the galaxy trailer hit with ''hooked on a feeling'' and it looked really cool then when it came out it was really cool, well after seeing this trailer and eventually watching the movie, guardians of the galaxy will be as good as taking a shit!

THIS TRAILER JUST SHOWED ME THAT WARNER/DC ARE GONNA OWN IT THIS YEAR!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will be FBI on the film!!It's possible to see on Slipknot's punch scene
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY FUCKING FUCK THIS IS A TRAILER FINALLY 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn will def steal this movie nooooo doubt.
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this the next Guardians of the Galay? Loool but the movie looks quite interesting.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Check out our channel
Any support will be returned!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody just made this trailer even better!! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC took a cue from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - WHY SO SERIOUS?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really like this trailer. Makes me think of Guardians of the Galaxy. Maybe its the classic music...
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto wants to talk  like  Heath Ledger ???    bah
CmRih_VtVAs,So A-team meets Guardians of the Galaxy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"On the Captain Boomerang' punch scene, all the guys are using a red card with a white ball, anyone have idea what is this simble???"
CmRih_VtVAs,Did he just punch a girl !
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is this called trailer 1? Didn't they already release one?
CmRih_VtVAs,Reckon Jarad Leto's gonna smash it as Joker😁😁
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck the joker is so bad interpreted in this fucking movie
CmRih_VtVAs,That's really who they picked for harley quinn?  Her acting is cringeworthy at best.
CmRih_VtVAs,hija
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks really scary and Jared Leto looks like he's enjoying playing him
CmRih_VtVAs,"most
badass
trailer
ever"
CmRih_VtVAs,My mom came in when i paused at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,First song name pls
CmRih_VtVAs,If it's PG-13 it's shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,@2:07 look at them groceries
CmRih_VtVAs,the only thing i'm scared of is that the trailers might be better than the movie :o
CmRih_VtVAs,"TOO MUCH JOKER AND HERLEY, IM OUT."
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why tf r ppl hating on will smith as deadshot? His acting looks great to me
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared leto is gonna crush this role....
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry but the character of Harley Quinn got so over sexualized, why"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, I look at this and think that Guardians of the Galaxy raised superhero movies to a bar that everyone is desperate to meet. It is in that desperation they just went with whatever seemed to follow the same formula. Some things are just better on a page."
CmRih_VtVAs,"OHMYGOD
MY MIND HAS BEEN FUCKING BLOWN 
LIKE HOLY SHIT WTF MAN AS,4GH70ILEHLFKGJIRUOKL
WHY YOU DO DIS TO ME WHEN I'M TRYNA REVISE???

(i'm just so happy that it's going to be released after my GCSE's; my birthday's on the 30th so it might as well be an early birthday present~~ XD)"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a masterpiece trailer. The best I have seen for this year and one of the best I have ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS LOOKS SO GOOOD DAMN this trailer is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks awesome.  I'm more excited for this than Batman vs Superman or the next Avengers movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"RIP MARVEL, AND HELLOOOOO DC"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel: ""Deadpool!"" 
DC: ""Suicide Squad!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"1 like = 20 years good luck 
1 happy comment = double 
I am just starting 
Subscribe to enter"
CmRih_VtVAs,such a good put together
CmRih_VtVAs,Thus movie is gonna be lit
CmRih_VtVAs,"That ""Let's go save the world"" line from Will makes me cringe every time."
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC IS THE BEST, BATMAN V SUPERMAN AND THIS IS AWESOME"
CmRih_VtVAs,😯
CmRih_VtVAs,FREDDIE MERCURY YES
CmRih_VtVAs,who else came here because of cara delevingne?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 GROOT CROSSOVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,OH HELL YEAH
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will be so worthless.
CmRih_VtVAs,HELL TO THE YES!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn without a Brooklyn accent and sounds like Anna from Frozen.
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched dis when it had 14k views
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,"ich weiß einfach nicht was ich von dem Trainer halten soll und vom Will Smith, weil ich nicht weiß was er für eine Supperkraft hat"
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK! Now i have to watch the movie just because of the song. *I HAVE TO*.
CmRih_VtVAs,the voices they command her
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best movies of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm really impressed with the trailer. Really makes me want to watch it at the cinema rather than Batman v Superman which I'll wait for network TV release. Easily the second best superhero trailer after Deadpool so far.
CmRih_VtVAs,First trailer was a million times better in my opinion.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Amazing trailer, but I just can't see Will Smith being a bad guy."
CmRih_VtVAs,"They could have just played the whole song without any dialogue and it would have got more likes. From whatever rumours I have heard from insiders, this movie is going to be a stinking mess."
CmRih_VtVAs,WAIT A MINUTE IS DAT DA JOKER?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone else be like Margaret Robbie while I think she's awesome look how epic cara delevigne looks like damn
CmRih_VtVAs,The retro music and the humor reminds me of Guardians of the Galaxy and that is a good thing.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks way better then batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,This was fucking amazing🔥💕
CmRih_VtVAs,este año se lo lleva DC
CmRih_VtVAs,EU TO ARREPIADA! Ç_________________Ç
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 any guess who/what that is?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley's ass though!
CmRih_VtVAs,More psyched about this one than BvS!
CmRih_VtVAs,by far one of the best trailers I've ever seen definitely watching
CmRih_VtVAs,"+*Jack Daniel* haha yeah the method really does work great, tested it just now and made another *$300* extra so far today
I mean simply go watch this tutorial video again here: y2u.be/BYSMfSK9YCU

before he makes it private only *LOL*"
CmRih_VtVAs,Loooooved the trailer but still having problems with that Joker though.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who or what is that at 1:48?
CmRih_VtVAs,the soundtrack don't match
CmRih_VtVAs,As a ten year old and not a big fan of dc i think i might ask to watch this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad. U had to my attention, now you have my curiosity."
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer was cool it looks like to a fun action movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW!!! AWESOME!!!!!!  ...AND WITH QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!! #SuicideSquad
CmRih_VtVAs,I like this but don't like that they made this seem upbeat as the first was real dark
CmRih_VtVAs,best moment = 2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Deadshot wears his mask for the majority of the film. I think it looks awesome and completes the outfit. probably won't happen though since they'll want Will Smith'S face to get ample screen time.
CmRih_VtVAs,What did the voices say
CmRih_VtVAs,Arrow
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy hell. I just came like twice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Sir, sir! We've found out why Marvel is so much more successful than us!""

""Well, what is it? WHAT IS IT DAMMIT!""

""They appear to use a new technique called 'hyew-morr.' They also use colors other than grey.""

""MADNESS! MADNESS I SAY! But if it works for them, jam our next movie full of colors and this... 'hyew-morr' stuff."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Good job not showing Doomsday three quarters the way through the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg i love harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"is this the real life 





what a song to pick"
CmRih_VtVAs,How are you guys saying this is how you make a good trailer? Guardians of the Galaxy did the same exact thing as this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The movies I'm most excited for 2016 are deadpool and this one. They both have fantastic trailers and should be rated R. That's why I think Deadpool's gonna be better. I hope  suicide squad is gonna be awesome but the PG 13 rating is a joke. You have such violent and insane characters, so why the hell a PG 13? F@ing money..."
CmRih_VtVAs,The music was the best part.
CmRih_VtVAs,Furious Pete? WTF
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that woman with the kitanna from Arrow? You know Akio's mother?
CmRih_VtVAs,Mama Mia!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"What the actual FUCK >?!
Why do they keep putting piece of shit music in awesome trailers ? 
Star Trek Beyond ...now this ....
Whatever happened to epic Music ?>
Hope the movie is good though !"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Success in the majority of circumstances depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed, checkout *(I G R O C K E T D O T C O M)*  and legit fame within days"
CmRih_VtVAs,People say that dc movies are too dark but when they bring in some humor the bitching and moaning begins.
CmRih_VtVAs,cara <3
CmRih_VtVAs,the comic con trailer had me wanting to watch it... this trailer is bad. I now not only do not want to watch this movie. but am looking forward to the marvel movies more. those movies will be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the blond girl on 1:46
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so glad there is no BOWAAAAAAAAAs in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"I thought the first trailer they released was so much better. I love queen more than the next guy, but the song seemed so misplaced. Will smith seems misplaced.. The 'comedy' seemed misplaced. I was hoping for a darker feel like the first trailer. What a shame"
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite shot of the trailer is when Margot Robbie is bent over at the end. My god. She's hot
CmRih_VtVAs,harley is practically the star of the movie... lookin forward for it
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh...
CmRih_VtVAs,They're probably having a fun time making this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,that gold plated joker AK tho
CmRih_VtVAs,MY BODY IS READY
CmRih_VtVAs,theres so much more joker in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol best trailer ever, they also perfectly made Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm gonna have to get used to Harley's voice. Even by looking at her I can only imagine the high pitched one xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"The song doesn't really go with the movie. God song, good trailer but they don't go 🙃"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer came out on my Birthday. Best Day Ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,"There was so much happening in that I have mo fucking idea what happened, but it was beautiful"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just have one thing to say, Queen - ""bohemian Rhapsody"""
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Man I can't get over how horrible Harley and joker look and act in this movie. The rest look good though.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is why DC is better than marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or did that sound like Nina Dobrev at 1:27?
CmRih_VtVAs,what a kick ass song for a kick ass tralier
CmRih_VtVAs,*cara
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else seeing this cuz cars delevigne is in it
CmRih_VtVAs,What's with the joker laying down with all those knives any ideas?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This year is gonna be epic!! We got Deadpool, Civil War, Batman Vs. Superman, Suicide Squad! Jared Leto with his grills make look so maniacal."
CmRih_VtVAs,love this song
CmRih_VtVAs,Since when did Harley Quinn have blue and pink hair?
CmRih_VtVAs,holy fuck.. perfect use of Bohemian Rhapsody tbf
CmRih_VtVAs,Im just going to say what were all thinking: Harley Quinn is the reason were seeing this
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope this is going to be better than ""Assault on Arkham."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Too much comments about how much is people able to cry
CmRih_VtVAs,Not impressed
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still wondering who's team I'm on? America. If America wants to hire criminals to do their bidding, then our fictions have fully come to reflect our fact... 
Oh and so... Boomerangs now have Captains?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks like a clone of guardians of the galaxy, but one that isn't going to be nearly as good"
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith looks BADASS!!
CmRih_VtVAs,awful
CmRih_VtVAs,time to jerk off
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY OMFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
CmRih_VtVAs,Sorry but Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn sucks :(
CmRih_VtVAs,"its called ""suicide squad"" but i dont see robin williams, amanda todd, or kurt cobain."
CmRih_VtVAs,http://goldenmines.biz/img/banners2/150x150/3.gif
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know about the comic but this looks pretty cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Such a great trailer. That's how you make a trailer, well done. *cheers*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is fucking awesome, makes you think about Batman V Superman that will be a completly shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,is this dc or marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,me da esperanza
CmRih_VtVAs,"If nothing else, Ayer made Croc look fucking perfect. Can't wait to see this"
CmRih_VtVAs,se ve padre :3
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to suck.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer...got me pregnant
CmRih_VtVAs,"I didn't care for Suicide Squad at first; but after this, holy fuck,  I'm ready."
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith baby
CmRih_VtVAs,It sounds like the Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Wow that is a good grip, you should not pick a fight with this person."" - Lex Luthor"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Remember when people could enjoy a trailer without screaming ""spoileeeeeeeeeeeeers !"" ""they showed us everything, omagahd"" ?

... yeah, neither do I, as it seems so long, long ago."
CmRih_VtVAs,"CAN'T.....................STOP.............................WATCHING,........................SO..............................GREAT:D"
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,First time ive seen a trailer that was made in this type of style. Good job
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44  what the hell is that thing?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a dream. Thank you Warner Bros.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else annoyed with Will Smith playing the same ""calm-tough"" guy act in every god damn movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara and Margot...  ♡♡
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks good but I think im going to boycott this movie.....
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like this is DC's version of Guardians of the Galaxy. Story starts off with people who do bad things, but they team up for a good purpose. Not trying to hate it though, so since I liked Guardians, this ought to be good too!"
CmRih_VtVAs,August???? why?????
CmRih_VtVAs,will Smith at start getting ready to fight guards reminds me exactly of Tom Hardy in Bronson. I feel like Will Smith stole it. it looks too much alike..
CmRih_VtVAs,...where's Harley Quinn's accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,Please someone tell me what is song name ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love Margot Robbie! amazing in every which way
CmRih_VtVAs,Spoiler at 1:58 ??
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant Wait OMGGG <3 <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Well the thumbnail shows who's going to die lol
CmRih_VtVAs,who is that Groot lookalike character at 1.44?
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm beyond pumped for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,@Cesar Morales  how was Mexico?
CmRih_VtVAs,(furiously pleasures self over Bohemian Rhapsody combined with DC Comics)
CmRih_VtVAs,"oohh YES, that made my day!"
CmRih_VtVAs,was that joker
CmRih_VtVAs,What a superbly cut trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,"March 25 cannot come soon enough, dying to see BvS, loved the trailers so fur... But somehow this trailer makes me to skip time all the way to August.. lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,The BEST FREAKING TRAULER I HAVE EVER SEEN CANT WAIT! yes....
CmRih_VtVAs,lol @ all the whining
CmRih_VtVAs,oh hell yes!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see it!!
CmRih_VtVAs,EITA QUE ESSE PROMETE!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Love that they chose Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,no slade :c
CmRih_VtVAs,If only Deathstroke was in this film or was sent to kill someone. I should just fucking kill Slipknot. That would make all fan bots jizz there pants.😂
CmRih_VtVAs,"What is Scott Eastwood doing in this movie? I mean, who is he? Is he really going to be the Nightwing? I mean, he has a lot of highlights in this movie so he must be an important character but who?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"that Bohemian Rhapsody tho :"")"
CmRih_VtVAs,im in love with this film. i thought the first trailer was great but this one gives it a run for its money ..
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't see this guy topping Ledger's Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, looks great!!! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS TRAILER IS SO GOOD WTHH
CmRih_VtVAs,love it
CmRih_VtVAs,screw her not sounding like she should
CmRih_VtVAs,"cant fucking wait,batman has a fight scene in it apperently,ben affleck playing him"
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer of the year?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay first of all, I really like bohemian rhapsody by Queen, but it really doesn't suite this trailer. I understand the vibe I guess it is trying to make, but the remake of Bee Gees in the previous trailer was soooo much better and gave it such a sick, twisted aspect."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG !!!! THAAT HAARLEEY !!!! * o *
CmRih_VtVAs,climaxed at 2:07...
CmRih_VtVAs,Calling it. Potential spoilers btw. The bad guy is an atlantian who has some sort of mind control power. And that's how Aquaman ties into the JL
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the age for the moive
CmRih_VtVAs,I've seen this so many times it's kinda sad
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rapsody😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks more like a comedy not an action. I like it!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,who's that ? 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet this was inspired by suicide
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like Sucide Squad, my favorite band is Queen, my 2 favorite villans are The Joker and Harley...I love Harley 7u7...I LOVE THIS TRAILER ♡.♡!"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like a pepsi commercial
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this like the Guardians of The Galaxy of DC?
CmRih_VtVAs,How long is the move?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Good For Yow! Hey,"" escape dress % !"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm loving the panda shooting shit up.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell. Freaking. Yes.
CmRih_VtVAs,oooo will smith!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is... beautiful. There are no other words to describe this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Excellent trailer!  No spoilers were shown!! I cannot wait!  And whoever casted Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn deserves a serious raise!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dat ass, or lack there of..."
CmRih_VtVAs,In love with Harley Quinn!
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks interesting but the humor feels a bit forced.
CmRih_VtVAs,I sooooo can't wait for this movie! Joker and Harley will steal the show
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than Batman V trailer for sure!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Every time I watch this trailer, I scroll down to see what new comments have crawled its way to the top. It's only been so many hours and there have been different kings each time..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"DON'T PRESS READ MORE

Warned you."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury is rolling over in his grave.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice use of Bohemian Rhapsody. I applaud that choice. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't even
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith better get an Oscar for this. OR WE'LL RIOT!
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought Harley quinn was in the movie I've watched the trailer three times and cannot spot her anywhere
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm starting to wonder if the vines and the person controlling them with green skin means that their going against poison ivy. That being said, if it is, this IS a much better representation of just how much power she has. Leto looks like he's doing a great job too"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, did anyone else notice Joker throwing Harleen Quinzel into some green chemicals at 1:57? Joker throwing the soon to be Harley Quinn into Ace Chemicals, awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Much better than Sea Biscuit and Sharknado trailers.
CmRih_VtVAs,Но Джокер какой то пидорковатый.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love this trailer, but I have literally no idea what the hell is going on"
CmRih_VtVAs,wait wheres kurt and robin Williams?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody really did worked well with this.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:32 that timing
CmRih_VtVAs,It's kinda what marvel did with guardians. They took a classic song and made it work in a unique way. I really like that
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel or DC? why not both?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker grill is still terrible, but that was one hell of a trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard queen and my heart beatings gettingggg crazyyy
CmRih_VtVAs,WoW Jai Courtney looks like he's acting
CmRih_VtVAs,the new joker looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,trash
CmRih_VtVAs,why it is so fucked up whyyyyyyyyyy
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I'm the only one who really HATED this trailer. I mean this is one of the most boring ass trailers plus the Joker is absolutely ruined and is terrible which is the main aspects of the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so good
CmRih_VtVAs,"трейлер огонь) давай, русскоязычный ютуб. засри эти комменты"
CmRih_VtVAs,if been waiting for this new trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,are they fighting the guy from prototype?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman all look amazing. Excited for all the DCEU movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,why is no one talking about 1:58
CmRih_VtVAs,lame
CmRih_VtVAs,a movie with jinx <3
CmRih_VtVAs,looks lame
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is bae
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome to see so many views in such a short while on this masterpiece!! Good to know that there is a lot of us minds that have good taste and think alike... :) .the others...well I guess you could say that the others just don't get it. The genius of this beautiful and fine piece of work has flown over their heads and doesn't  appear to be ever coming back ;p
CmRih_VtVAs,love it
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy Shit I'm speechless!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 best part of the trailer so badass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Wait, what's that? I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry, it's the voices.. Haha, I'm kidding! That's not what they really said..."" I think I'm in love with this character already."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the way Bohemian Rhapsody synchronised with the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody on a trailer what else you want !!.........
CmRih_VtVAs,I know right Will smith wwwwhhhhhaaaaattttt
CmRih_VtVAs,Pos ya pa que veo la película p:
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than fantastic 4. I guess
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks so stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever......Queen + Suicide Squad + Astro head phones = Eargasm can't wait for this frickin movie tho
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"will smith!? what? what???
ughh...."
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so fucking sick
CmRih_VtVAs,Much better trailer than the Civil War trailer. I think This movie will destroy the Box office. 2016 is DC year.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wolves not far.
CmRih_VtVAs,needs to be a little darker
CmRih_VtVAs,"As long as Harley says ""Mr. J"" at least once, I will be happy."
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate to be that guy but... Harley's accent...
CmRih_VtVAs,Um senhor trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Imagine walking behind Margot Robbie for months filming this while she is wearing that. Damn.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Edgar Wright made trailers, he would make trailers for Suicide Squad. This trailer had his sense of fun, energy, humour and the editing and sound was just brilliant. One of the best trailers I've seen maybe ever. The film could still be mediocre but the effort they are putting in definitely shows potential. SS gets it right where BvS gets it wrong in terms of marketing. More bang bang, ha ha, boom boom - wow and less... plot. I actually want to find out what happens in this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,this could be the best DC comics movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not first, not last. I'm John Cena!!!!!!!!!!'"
CmRih_VtVAs,the amount of love that hit me from seeing this trailer... holy shit i can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the rating
CmRih_VtVAs,1:47 for bad ass Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,"harley honestly gives me chills, in the same way heath ledger did. 

"" oh what i should kill everyone and escape??? ha sorry its the voices..just kidding...thats not what they said"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"yessssssss , can't wait for it!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Pretentious trailer. even the actors are trying too hard. RELAX!!
CmRih_VtVAs,who is the enemy at the train station ????
CmRih_VtVAs,I can no longer listen to Bohemian Rhapsody without being creeped out.. That was a great trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,the dialogue is still cringeworthy but now so much so that it doesn't even bother me anymore.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is going to be better than Batman v. Superman, and think about this, Tom Hardy was supposed to be in this movie, how much more awesome would that have been? Think about it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait a second anyone notice the birth of Harley Quinn scenes?
CmRih_VtVAs,bat man feelings
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for Harley!
CmRih_VtVAs,AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,How much did it cost to pay for that many upvotes?
CmRih_VtVAs,Now now children we are all equal by that I mean doc and marvel are both awesome why can't we just all love them both
CmRih_VtVAs,I preferred the leaked trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,this will be the best villain i mean villains movie ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,open up with bohemian rhapsody. Great way to start a trailer lmao.
CmRih_VtVAs,"From somone more on the MCU-side of things for now: THIS seems to be the movie for setting up the DC-Movie universe properly. The trailer at least destroys the BvS-one (with the help of Freddie no wonder ^^)

But finally DC gets rid of their boring Nolan-heritage and embraces insanity again! Mutants, Witches, and a very promising Joker (plus Harley, already a win) - geez, this looks like the Batman-Universe-Movie I was hoping for since...Burton's Batman Returns. Damn, we even might get a decent Scarecrow, an actually interesting Ras Al Ghul, and a Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy that are not parodies? *shudder* Damn, I almost stopped believing this could happen ...

DC-Fans: This seems to be the movie you should put your hopes and money on. BvS will be bigger at the Box Office, but those Anti-Avengers are probably the more fun experience ^^"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully Will Smith wins an Oscar for this one....... 
CmRih_VtVAs,YAAAAS
CmRih_VtVAs,dat ass 2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,is that poison ivy in the subway?
CmRih_VtVAs,"THIS is how you make a trailer 
Ps. This looks way better than BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,Much better humor than Marvel movies
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not first not last. I'm John Cenaaaaaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley queen is sexy
CmRih_VtVAs,"S.S vs Deadpool :D








Deadpool"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst casting choices ever, for sure. Right up there with Batman vs Superman. Should have just stuck with what's happening in Arrow and those casting choices.

I'll be giving this movie a pass."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so hyped for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"sry folks, but scene @ 1:35 is the best for me ;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:23 Oh no, it's finally happened--The Residents have gone mad!!!
...well, *violently* mad."
CmRih_VtVAs,❤❤❤
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith as dead shot?
Bleeeeehhhhhhh."
CmRih_VtVAs,Golden trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm here because of Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,IDK why... but it seems... doll...
CmRih_VtVAs,did I just saw this movie in a trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,JXKSOSKSJS IM SO HAPPY THIS MOVIE COMES OUT IN THE MONTH OF MY BIRTHDAY
CmRih_VtVAs,Generic action comedy superhero film. I cringed my way through that trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian really doesn't go with the trailer, but anything beats any trailer from batman v superman at this point
still excited for this movie to come out though"
CmRih_VtVAs,uuuuhhhhhh......meh
CmRih_VtVAs,who are the bad guys in this movie? like the ones the bad guys in the squad are after
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, DC ain't missing around"
CmRih_VtVAs,"another hero move, save the world, lots of booms, guns and big buildings get destroyed.
 So they get the bad guys, the bad guys save the world and then every one loves them..
 the end"
CmRih_VtVAs,Besides the Marilyn Manson Joker this looks great. Now if only the heroes in DC movies could get a personality they might be able to compete with Marvel. The heroes are so dull and boring they are hard to root for.
CmRih_VtVAs,there you go DC
CmRih_VtVAs,Под пивко сойдет
CmRih_VtVAs,Vai ser um melhores filmes do ano! #ChupaMarvel #DC
CmRih_VtVAs,9GAGGER WOLOLOLOLOL
CmRih_VtVAs,"just , will smith, is he deadshot or deathstroke?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Spoiler Alert: Will Smith doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. Jada gets butthurt, takes to YouTube and Facebook, starts #BlackOscarsMatter"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I didn't realise this was going to be a comedy. :( I was expecting it to be dark and serious. Very disappointing.

And what were they thinking with that soundtrack? I was waiting for 2 of the characters to start headbanging in the car."
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this actually looks fun. Not all grey-style dark and depressing like man of steel. But It looks like it is not taking itself too seriously. I like that.
CmRih_VtVAs,There portrayal of the joker is going to ruin this movie....😕😔🙁
CmRih_VtVAs,the trailer is awesome... but Bohemian Rhapsody playing in the background makes it perfect 👌
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC!
CmRih_VtVAs,i would like the joker better without the silver teeth
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 = Harley Quinn ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"You see directors, this is how you make movies, and dont spoil them 'cough cough BvS'"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love everything about this except the continued nonsensical pushing of Katana by DC in every single medium they touch. No one cares about Katana, DC. Please try to buck the trend of laughable pandering to Asian markets by shoehorning pointless Chinese/Japanese/etc characters and locations into every single blockbuster movie. It's becoming worse than the Wilhelm scream."
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY FUCKING QUINN!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"chill out, robocop"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Jared Leto's version of the Joker seems interesting.  Obviously, any Joker is going to be compared to Ledger's.  However, Ledger's Joker was great, unnerving, and scary because we didn't know much about him or his goals (besides wanting to cause anarchy).  He wanted to kill Batman, then not.  He robbed the mob, then worked as their hitman, then betrayed them.  He was completely unpredictable.  Leto's Joker seems like he has a goal.  Which is arguably much scarier."
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh my god did DC just make a movie that feels like a comic book? Alright, despite being a much bigger marvel fan, I'll admit, they're on the right tracks!"
CmRih_VtVAs,YOU PRACTICALLY SHOWED THE WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome! Can't wait to see the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 - Why does the Joker look like Flatttop Jones from Dick Tracy? Lol he still looks cool though.
CmRih_VtVAs,Killer Croc looks almost the same as he does in Arkham Origins.
CmRih_VtVAs,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the best trailer of any movie I've ever seen and I've watched it over and over! So excited to see this film, I already think I like Boomerang the best"
CmRih_VtVAs,*Suicide Squad >>>> batman vs super man*
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is it that, the movie about super villians, seem more light hearted and less gritty than the one about super hero's?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Margot is definitely going to be the star of the movie. Especially since she's playing one of DC comics most beloved and famous villain. The only thing that's missing is her accent but I can get with that. I hope DC comics will make a movie just with Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer killed it with that song, god damn"
CmRih_VtVAs,El mejor trailer que vi en mucho tiempo.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 you are welcome.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sooooo gunna see this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Very first time I can sit here and actually watch a movie trailer from start to end and re-play it. I really hope this movie is as great as it looks now👍👍
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes just yes
CmRih_VtVAs,ammm idk about this but does harley die at 1:58 if you look its the joker holding what looks like to be dead her
CmRih_VtVAs,quiero!!
CmRih_VtVAs,That was a pretty awesome trailer. Movie seems pretty kickass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, a trailer of a good movie with no spoilers"
CmRih_VtVAs,I already now I'm going to love the soundtrack after listening to bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"for anyone interested:
one of Harley's pigtail gets the red from jokers shirt and the other one gets blue from her shirt. That's straight up romance right there :d"
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody else wondering what 1:58 is? The Joker's skin is like gone showing only what looks like muscle.....?
CmRih_VtVAs,Directed by Michael Bay?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was excited about this film until this trailer, it still good but it seems like they're copying marvels way of doing movies when I always thought dc were better because they seemed grimy, darker and more realistic, and before all the nerds start saying its a comic book movie and it should be like that, dark knight was a comic book movie and it was way better than the old comicy movies from Joel Schumacher or that shitty Adam west batman series, and I get the choice of song, it sounds chaotic to match the team. but it also sounds super gay!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think they just put in bohemian rhapsody cuz it's the hype of the Internet it really doesn't fit into the trailer. maybe in the end when the guitar kicks in woth the action but the rest was off
CmRih_VtVAs,I think they just put in bohemian rhapsody cuz it's the hype of the Internet it really doesn't fit into the trailer. maybe in the end when the guitar kicks in woth the action but the rest was off
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how Enchantress said ""Let's do something fun"" and I'm like ""That was probably a line said by a DC and WB intern. She was probably either fired or thrown out of the window like that guy in the comic strip meme."
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever thought putting Bohemian Rhapsody as the fuckin track in the this trailer or any movie trailer for that matter should be fired and castrated.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm actually more excited about this movie than SvB. It just sux the wait has to be so long. 
CmRih_VtVAs,"who is the name of the first song,please :)?"
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""It's the voices. I'm kidding, that's not really what they said!"" okay me"
CmRih_VtVAs,"There was a time when YouTube was ruled by user-generated content. Now it's just big media's hype machine and the only way to get views is to ""REACTION"" spam every trailer as they come in."
CmRih_VtVAs,*bohemian rhapsody >>> baile de favela*
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN<3
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M SO EXCITED I CAN'T BREATHE
CmRih_VtVAs,"They made someone sipping a drink hilarious... 
This trailer is amazing!"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 best part of the video....
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is this coming out 8 months from now???? It's  DONE release it NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,i have more faith in this movie being what wakes marvel then batman vs superman. this looks like a contender
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't believe that they actually used Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" in this trailer.  LOL it's amazing what kind of songs that you can find in movie Trailers nowadays."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wayne's World 1:36 = Head Bobbing Time!
CmRih_VtVAs,Охуен4ик
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker actually looks good in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,does any one else get a ballad of gay tony vibe ?
CmRih_VtVAs,0.55 she reminds me a lot about Anne Hathaway!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08
CmRih_VtVAs,La música sube el nivel un 200% (no soy fan pero Guau esta que promete)
CmRih_VtVAs,much better than the disappointing batman v. super-man trailer. my reservations towards Jared Leto are being lifted now. he sounds pretty good!
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck's sake I can't seem to escape bohemian rhapsody. I'm hearing it EVERYWHERE. I'M GOING CRAZY.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:34 Diablo scream very... Super Saiyan xD
CmRih_VtVAs,Also I'm pretty sure this is the first DC movie to actually have color in it. It actually looked vibrant.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody 
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my favorite song!
CmRih_VtVAs,"i read comment section and i see all these poor kid always complains about these trailer and dc and marvel movies, go to hell fucking kid's and just enjoy all these movies anyway if they are marvel and dc"
CmRih_VtVAs,O mais top de todos
CmRih_VtVAs,they just showed the whole fkn movies...WTF!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer shows that its more of a comedy than the other 1
CmRih_VtVAs,Vá SE FUDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!! Tá foda de mais!!! PQP!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Feeling sorta iffy on this one
but I will still definitely be seeing it."
CmRih_VtVAs,They could have done better with Killer Croc and Joker's appearance.
CmRih_VtVAs,How insecure can one be to compare this to GOTG.  Suicide Squad is NOTHING like the  Guardians of the Universe. I mean Galaxy.  For one you won't see no talking Raccoons.
CmRih_VtVAs,Shwing....!
CmRih_VtVAs,Aaaand Harley doesn't have her signature accent
CmRih_VtVAs,EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,CARACARACARACARA
CmRih_VtVAs,Se ve mucho mejor que Batman/Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Now THIS is how you make a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,i just realized something they did not spoil the movie in the trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is excellent. This also sorta swayed my opinion on Jared Leto.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everything in this is awesome, except for Jared Leto's pathetic attempt at a Joker. That thing can suck it."
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasn't into this movie until this trailer. This looks good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell Yeah!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,No actually 2:08'
CmRih_VtVAs,please re-upload in true 21:9 ratio without letterboxing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Now I am honestly starting to like the Jared Leto Joker look.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a good trailer. although I'm pretty sure trailer 2 is gonna spoil the story.
CmRih_VtVAs,Waaa!!! they used my fav song!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:31 sorry, oh yeah"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 - 2:08 you're welcome.
CmRih_VtVAs,3:31 oh yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,YYYYAYAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,Yup.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Comic-Con trailer was so much better, this one sucks."
CmRih_VtVAs,О чем эта хуйня
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is not nearly what I expected, yes they most certainly are copying Guardians of the Galaxy....It's sickening to me, bc Assault on Arkham had a better approach on Suicide Squad better than this piece of shit film...I am totally heartbroken that 2 of my favorite villains are being seen as a ""Joke"" and not in the Joker sense kind of way...In the ""sad pathetic attempt to get viewers to laugh"" kind of way....I take them seriously and so should David Ayer and the rest of his mediocre crew....It is a huge slap in the face. What rubbish this will be."
CmRih_VtVAs,To be honest I'm not really feeling the Harley Quinn voice here. But as a big fan of Harley Quinn I'll take it. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Amusing
CmRih_VtVAs,They had me at Queen...
CmRih_VtVAs,dead shot looks gr8 and can someone tell me what practical reason is there to have harle quin? she's hot n all but just useless
CmRih_VtVAs,nice. 3 stars.
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY QUINN
CmRih_VtVAs,"nada a declarar de relevante até agora! me parece um filme legal, mas quero que seja espetacular."
CmRih_VtVAs,si vis pacem para bellum
CmRih_VtVAs,made way better by using music from Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,meh just not into will smith as Dead shot or the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I just came...
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't express the pleasure i feel when the music and the action synchronize so perfectly. I just can't.
CmRih_VtVAs,".. the upcoming fantasy thriller directed by David Eyre, based on the eponymous comic book publisher DC Comics and the third film in a row Expanded DC Universe after the ""Batman vs. Superman"" **   I have to watch it ))"
CmRih_VtVAs,Definitely going to watch. 2016 is going to be pretty epic!
CmRih_VtVAs,Man I cannot wait to watch this. Meet me at the the theater and I'll buy 1 person a ticket! I'm in Jacksonville Florida
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow :D !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,IM IN FUCKING LOVE

CmRih_VtVAs,"who is the person that says ""what is wrong with you people""?"
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks great and funny 😂😂😶😶
CmRih_VtVAs,whats this rated ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Those graphics were sexy at the end
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is just a f******g great character... SHE S JUST CRAZY LIKE MEEEEEEEEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 best moment of the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"See the problem now is that I have been watching the ""Arrow"" , so now you want me to adapt to these new characters for the suicide squad /.- wtf man ! But still looks great !"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope someone wins an award for this trailer. The editing in this thing gives me a diamond-solid hard on.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully Cara does a better job here than in Paper Towns
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that this will be the best movie this year for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well that sucked...
CmRih_VtVAs,That last line was cringing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"There's so much action! 


I love it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?  

Is this not a good looking film?"
CmRih_VtVAs,guardians of the galaxy Dc version
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whats the word?
Come on. 
You got this....

Ass"
CmRih_VtVAs,Gon suck
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 got me like...    :O
CmRih_VtVAs,flop alert
CmRih_VtVAs,Why did they chose this demonic song Beelzebub save a seat for me
CmRih_VtVAs,"D.C. comics has discovered this new thing called ""humor.""

While not much is understood about this ""humor"" at D.C. headquarters, experts believe it may be a new effective way to entertain people in theaters.  Research is ongoing."
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 August..... and u show me the trailer now....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Unlike most people in the comments, I'm not going to be an asshole and make fun or you for not knowing the song in the trailer (yes, I know it's a classic, but there is no song on earth that everybody knows). The song is 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,who or what are they fighting? looks like a robot venom
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please, no PG-13 Rating."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching
CmRih_VtVAs,ja estou ansioso pro proximo tariler kk
CmRih_VtVAs,I was JUST listening to Bohemian Rhapsody. Seems like fate hath struck again.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can´t watch to wait this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT IN THE WORLD DID I JUST WATCH?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is not that good. 
IT'S AWESOME!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Thats jinx? ._.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 umh... is that Joker saving Harley Quinn? of... what exactly?
CmRih_VtVAs,"7 months my birthday, I'm mad and happy but I have to wait 7 months!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not a huge fan of dc (I prefer marvel)  but this looks like it's gonna be really good
CmRih_VtVAs,"When first heard Bohemian Rhapsody I thought it was just a joke, it didn't seem to match the movie. But I guess it to mock the characters there, and that makes sense to me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"wait... was that Margo? So, this is what happened after Paper Towns"
CmRih_VtVAs,omgshh Jokers laugh with the knifes 😄 Perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"Move over Batman v Superman 


Literally."
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer rip off of Star Trek Beyond trailer lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I am become hype.
CmRih_VtVAs,An R rating would fit nicely
CmRih_VtVAs,i only watched the trailer 50 times so i can appreciate Margot Robbie's ass.... daaammmnnn
CmRih_VtVAs,pls subscribe to Susan Howell 17vids 2subs
CmRih_VtVAs,"The most difficult part of this trailer is it doesn't make you bored,even if you wanted to be!
I'm watching it too many times."
CmRih_VtVAs,february DEADPOOL..then..august SUICIDE SQUAD...OMG!! I can't wait!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I SEE CARA DELEVIGNE !?!?!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,shut up and take my kids tuition
CmRih_VtVAs,"THEORY TIME!!
So this is a DC shared universe....so meaning that what ever happens on one DC superhero movie will directly effect the other whether big or small....that takes us to Midway City. a place where hackman and girl resides and a place that was devastated by Apokolips......Seems like Ben Affleck was right....Justice league will be huge!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I HAVE REALLY HIGH EXPECTATIONS
PLS DONT RUIN IT"
CmRih_VtVAs,"pleaasee! this trailer puts marvel to shame. DC haters get lost, marvels had their fun, now it's our turn!"
CmRih_VtVAs,lol I see the joker is doing well now that people have actually seen something...
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith rocks!
CmRih_VtVAs,"it's official...TOP 3 longest running cartoons with new episodes each year on American tv:
The Simpsons (years 1989 to 2016)-Fox Channel
Pokemon (years 1998 to 2016)-Cartoon Network Channel
South Park (years 1997 to 2016)-Comedy Central Channel"
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:06 , What a beautiful purse !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,LEGIT ONE OF THE BEST TRAILER EVERRRRR AND BEST USE EVERRRRR OF THE BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY ✋✋ I swear if I were a guy... I'd have a boner right now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Muito loco
CmRih_VtVAs,WILL SMITH IN A MOVIE = HORRIBLE PIECE OF CRAP MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,Where the hell is Harley Quinn's accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,Just by having Bohemian Rhapsody this movie won my heart!!
CmRih_VtVAs,pumped
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the plot to this movie doe who's evil and who actually good plot twist
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't fucking wait!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,im still disappointed about will smith being deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW within 18 hours it got 6 million views already???rip marvel             it's DC time to shine
CmRih_VtVAs,"Esse filme vai ser do caralho, meu hype foi pras alturas, nem a Nasa sabe onde foi parar!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else go back and pause at 2:08? Cause I did.
CmRih_VtVAs,hit the like if u r thinking Heath Ledger  is better than Jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,This film now has my attention. Can't wait to go and see it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I fucking love the fact that bohemian rhapsody was played in the backround
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen is such an amazing band and it went perfect together with the trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I look up to the sky, can't see my hype from here!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best sqaud ever of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so happy that this is a good trailer and it shows a lot while not revealing about the plot. I'm so hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,"One thing I don't understand: Why is the Joker in this?  From what I understand, he's not part of the Suicide Squad.  What's going to be his purpose in being in this movie?  Fodder for Harley Quinn?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey wanna see a blind kid game with friends. Check out WeThreeDudes or BlindguyJosh
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool and Suicide Squad are going to make 2016 worth it alone! Im so pumped!! And Deadpool is only a few weeks away! AAHHHH!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just really love this trailer. A lot of people aren't a fan of the song choice, but I think it's great. Awesome that everything is in sync with it as well."
CmRih_VtVAs,clearly trying to copy the Guardians of the galaxy trailer style.
CmRih_VtVAs,I would prefer to see this to Batman vs Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Will smith will smith??? Yes will smith will smith this Movie!!
CmRih_VtVAs,still looks the shittiest Joker ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,AYOOO HOL UP
CmRih_VtVAs,who else got a boner when harley bent over to steal the thing at the end?🙈
CmRih_VtVAs,"holy shit, im ready."
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is one of the main reasons I'm going to love this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Охренеть аж в августе 😥
CmRih_VtVAs,я кончил.
CmRih_VtVAs,"so, you've been trying to sell us Suicide Squad as dark, moody movie for the past 6 months, and now, it's a one-liner fest, with joke, spunky lettering and a Queen song... mmmmkay..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,"anyone notice how Rick Flagg said ""your possesed by a witch"" while the girl playing enchantress is behind him listening... maybe I'm just looking too into it but weird man"
CmRih_VtVAs,"lmao , i already saw this trailer like 10 times , here we go again xD ..!"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC finally realized that marvel was gonna run them out of business if they didn't step up 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 - best shot
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great trailer, but jeez, the music sucks ass."
CmRih_VtVAs,The editing is so perfect :')
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sorry but this doesn't feel right without Harley's accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is the Suicide Squad trailer so much more happy and colorful than the Wonder Woman trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i'm here for Bohemian Rhapsody !!!
I'll watch the movie just bcoz they have not remixed Bohemian Rhapsody !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is exactly the type of trailer that I was expecting in the first trailer. Now you got my attention.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i'm here for Bohemian Rhapsody !!!
I'll watch the movie just bcoz they have not remixed Bohemian Rhapsody !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how much of this stuff (for example back stories) are actually makes into the final cut of the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto looks awesomely insane....

Suck it disbelievers!  I never doubted him for a moment <3 <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,squad Goals *.*
CmRih_VtVAs,Well I don't need to see this movie... the trailer was epic enough
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT TO SHOW YOU MY TOYS
CmRih_VtVAs,August...hurry up already!
CmRih_VtVAs,Excited for everything except the Joker. He looks like he's a dumb teenager
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 omg i Wanna...
CmRih_VtVAs,Im only going to see this cuz will smith in it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not gonna lie, when I saw Joker do that leap into the chemicals, I simply thought it was just a shot telling his origin story, before I saw him in the vat with Harley. I'd love to see an origin story for Joker in the DCEU, but if that doesn't happen, well there's always Tim Burton's Batman. This movie looks fantastic though, I'll be seeing both this and BVS non stop in the theaters. 2016 will be the year DC rises!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so excited. Harley Quinn is my favorite person ever. I love her. ""What was that? I should just kill everyone and escape?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,No other song suits this better
CmRih_VtVAs,So... who's Captain Boomerang? Jai Courtney?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is way better than the comic con trailer. This makes it seem fun, crazy, and full of energy. The other made it seem like a bored dark POS
."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fim da Fila me levou até aqui :3
CmRih_VtVAs,wow this looks terrible...
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else paused at 2:08?
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh nice DC's Attempt to make Guardians of the galaxy. let's see if they fuck it up or measure up nicely.
CmRih_VtVAs,Please be a 15 or an 18 no bars held back
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool vs Suicide Squad anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I admit, I was not a fan of the first few trailers but this is really shaping up. I feel more excited about this movie than Superman v. Batman."
CmRih_VtVAs,This. Movie. Is. Going. To. Be. Fucking. AWESOME.
CmRih_VtVAs,"At 0:45 look behind the guy reading off the names and there is Cara Delievigne (enchantress) and he says ""you're possessed by a witch"" like he's talking to her!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why does it always have to be DC vs Marvel? All 6 movies from both companies this year are looking to be AMAZING, stop limiting your enjoyment because of some stupid allegiance and enjoy them all!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fuck all this comic book cancer, it's all the same shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MY GOOOOD!!!! This is a fucking Sheet
CmRih_VtVAs,Кайф:-)
CmRih_VtVAs,this not sense.....wheres batman???

CmRih_VtVAs,In!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 < Click that repeatedly.
CmRih_VtVAs,YAAAASSS HARLEY
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, the first great trailer from DC since Man of Steel."
CmRih_VtVAs,*brain explodes*
CmRih_VtVAs,August can't come any sooner.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I only ask one thing of, DC. Just once, please give us a ""Mr. J"" from Harley Quinn. THAT'S ALL I ASK OF YOU."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ugh. I just can't stand the New 52 Harley Quinn costume. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

(She looks like she'll be great, though.)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the Joker jumping into acid. I see it through his clothes but he's not affected? assuming he dropped Harly first
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait!!!!
perfect song choice"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finalyyyy, WIll is! Missed you man"
CmRih_VtVAs,dear god I cannot wait!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks sooooooooo good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warner Brothers says that they are making at least 20 sequels to this Suicide squad, here are the titles of the next ones!

CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this ???
CmRih_VtVAs,"if they just used that four it could be a good film but NO, they need three villains completely dependent on artefacts to."
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only person who thinks that Poison Ivy could be the main villain?
CmRih_VtVAs,was that poison ivy
CmRih_VtVAs,What is it rated

CmRih_VtVAs,This. Is by far my most favorite trailer of this year I already know. And it's probably going to be my most favorite movie ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,I HOPE YOU'VE GOT INSURANCE MARVEL!
CmRih_VtVAs,OH. MY. GOD.
CmRih_VtVAs,I am dying to see this!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I loved Jerad in taxes buying club and he is looking even better as joker.. He is gonna pull this off.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the strongest out off all of them... And who's the leader?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:18 Jason Todd or?
CmRih_VtVAs,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! WHY AUGUST!?!?!?!?!?!

:(

I genuinely lived in fear everyday thinking I wouldn't ever be able to watch Star Wars because I thought something will happen to me... and now its back to living life in fear again..."
CmRih_VtVAs,FORSEN
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 2:07
Best part of the trailer. XD"

CmRih_VtVAs,Dope song choice

CmRih_VtVAs,So they cloned Clint Eastwood huh?
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok, puede que si la vea"
CmRih_VtVAs,August why can't it be june or july?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What was that,I should kill everyone and escape.Sorry,it's the voices.I'm kidding...Thats not what they really said"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. Yes. The first trailer made me nostalgic and I thought I might as well see it. But this trailer has just made me so hyped this movie that i now cant wait to see it.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS TRAILER IS AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,"seen... it...all....before. weak cgi, so called big names. it's going to be run of the mill unless it's an 18 rated."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't fucking wait! At least we have Deadpool coming out Feb 12. Now this. THEY'RE TORTURING US!
CmRih_VtVAs,this video sent shives down my spine
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker man... Absolutely no words.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So that's it, huh? ... We'dont make some kind of cheesy comments on this trailer?"
CmRih_VtVAs,i really hate the way the joker looks in this movie id rather have heath ledger play the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the colors.. that's probably the only thing I can say I like
CmRih_VtVAs,great soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07

CmRih_VtVAs,"I,m confuse who is the enemy?"

CmRih_VtVAs,"i'm not really sure about will smith being in here, don't get me wrong, he's a good actor and all, but it feels just weird seeing him as deadshot"
CmRih_VtVAs,she's cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh Jared Leto, you egghead"
CmRih_VtVAs,"sure, the guy beaten by night sticks and he had to be black, thats it im not watching the oscars.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Only excited to see Cara and Jared
CmRih_VtVAs,meh..
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything's exciting except for the Joker. This Joker doesn't seem that interesting.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know much about Suicide Squad, but it seems like this will be DC's equivalent to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Personally, based on this trailer, I feel that the second half of the film will be more enjoyable than the first half."
CmRih_VtVAs,jokerin cosplayi gittikçe kötüleşiyor.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks good, Cant wait."
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally they put Harley in something!!
CmRih_VtVAs,FINALLY bad guys win.

CmRih_VtVAs,We'll just have to watch this till August I guess
CmRih_VtVAs,türkler sa
CmRih_VtVAs,leave joker to batman
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad that PG-13 will kill this movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,Different.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This might actually be the best trailer I've seen since Age of Ultron. Even better than Deadpool. Perfect, just perfect. Can't wait."
CmRih_VtVAs,I was not expecting queen when I pressed this interesting choice
CmRih_VtVAs,!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuckin love Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,that damn forehead tattoo still bothers me
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly I've never been interested in comics before, but I am so totally seeing this when it comes out"
CmRih_VtVAs,Los guardianes de la galaxia! :v
CmRih_VtVAs,very original style of trailer. :D
CmRih_VtVAs,So is everyone just completely insane in this film?
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeeeesss!! soo excited for this 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wierd.. The first trailer/teaser looks dark and serious, this one not.
I'm confused."
CmRih_VtVAs,Legends of tomorrow with a lot more intriguing villains than the show itself can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE LETO AS THE JOKER!! LOOKS AWESOME!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is getting me so pumped!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer, every moment in it is just perfect and I can't stop watching."
CmRih_VtVAs,The lack of Harley's accent is more disturbing then her insanity /:
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anybody else see that more than once.
CmRih_VtVAs,Pls song
CmRih_VtVAs,what they said 👆👇
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna call it now this movie is gonna have better reviews than Batman v. Superman: In the Court of Justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like shit, smells like shit. Imma bet its shit. No thanks."
CmRih_VtVAs,I like this Joker much better then the last one.
CmRih_VtVAs,This. Looks. AMAZING. August can't come fast enough! I've been waiting for this for sooo long omg
CmRih_VtVAs,'we are bad guys this is what we do' i love Harley Quinn so much
CmRih_VtVAs,Русский?? Лайк на этот комментарий.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen's ""Bohemian rhapsody"" for the soundtrack for this trailer.  F***ING PERFECT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,..and I thought my jokes were bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hated the stupid new age hipster music in this. And Joker looks like crapola.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll watch it for the Asian chick.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Ugh, yes! I love the color! Hope this is a good movie because it's our first ever live action Harley Quinn and I adore her."
CmRih_VtVAs,"when I heard bohemian rhapsody within first second, i *knew* this was going to be good"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like the comicon trailer better! The dark feel is just so...perfect. bohemian rhapsody is one of the best songs ever made, but it's completely out of place, so were some of the scenes they chose. But despite that this movie looks great, margot robbie and jared letto definitely fit there rolls, and the dude with the fire (aka roy mustang :P) looks pretty dope. Cant quite see the fresh prince of bel air as deadshot though..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"God, wish Head Ledger was alive."
CmRih_VtVAs,lol I'm can't wait to this come out😂😁

CmRih_VtVAs,SUCH A DIFFERENT TONE TO THE LAST TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy Shit! Best FN Trailer Eeeeeeeevvvveeeeerrrrrrrrrrr!
CmRih_VtVAs,I predict massive hype on day of release followed by an underwhelming week of dissapointment.
CmRih_VtVAs,ебана рот опять уилл смит?
CmRih_VtVAs,my dick is so hard right now
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel is no longer the only big boy on the block! DCmarvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,Shut up and take my money!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto looks bad they said
CmRih_VtVAs,YES !!
CmRih_VtVAs,Your move DeadPool.
CmRih_VtVAs,Task Force X
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, I thought this was coming out in April? Huh."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that the Joker lifting Harley from a fluid bath - love at first sight?
CmRih_VtVAs,joker looks horrible
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Who plays the reptilian in this?
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara looks so creepy in some scenes
CmRih_VtVAs,Satanic shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Best of the worst
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks awful
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit. 

.....It actually looks quite fun and entertaining! 
.......I genuinely wasn't expecting that."
CmRih_VtVAs,7 MONTHS?! No one can wait 7 months!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who the hell was the evil-Groot? I can only think of Floronic Man, but that is it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Where's the ""Mistuh J"" from Harley .."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dam this looks fun
CmRih_VtVAs,I've watched this too many times
CmRih_VtVAs,A lot of this was filmed in Toronto near my work.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The more I watch, the more I realize that The Joker doesn't have any scene with other characters. Kinda feel he's not part of the squad? Maybe he's the villain for the movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,4/5
CmRih_VtVAs,"way better than the batman V superman trailer
my one fear is that the trailer tricks us into thinking that its a fun movie and then it tries to be man of steel serious and dark knight grim. that would blow."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is boycotting for lack of black people in the oscars and supports farrakhan, I boycott any movie with will smith or jada in it."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Mmm. dat ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Leto is gunna be like Jerome from Gotham can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"-
Now THAT makes this flick look even better than the teaser trailer...and I didn't think they could do much with that.
-"
CmRih_VtVAs,I see DC finally stepping up their game! But ehhh #MarvelFTW
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT!  :D :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst joker
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks great! My only qualm is Harley's lack of an NY accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,Duh
CmRih_VtVAs,Im going to be broke at the end of 2016.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopping its Rated R. its going to be fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 kinda put my hopes up.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is the guardians of the galaxy of DC ( in the good way of course)
CmRih_VtVAs,The best trailer I've seen for a long time :) Can't wait for the movie.... J.Leto never disappoints :)
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont really like the song in this trailer but the movie still looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is fucking perfect. At least they made up for that atrocious last BvS one. Looking forward to this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Nightmares of Leto welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope its great!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry to say... but this joker looks lame. He looks like a guy who works for the joker. He probably works for the true joker ""heath ledger"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't decide who I like the best....
CmRih_VtVAs,It won't be the same without Tom hardy
CmRih_VtVAs,"that will ne fun, music are awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to Fuck Harley Quinn! I don't care if she is a goddamn CRAZY!!!! hahahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,Jokers face at 1:23 really was there any doubt?
CmRih_VtVAs,honestly wayy better than the first movie. though i still get the feeling will smith is going to be on camera too much. hope he keeps the mask on.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker's reaction @ 1:53. Probably caught by Batman.
CmRih_VtVAs,Does this mean we might FINALLY get something good out of DC?  Fingers crossed.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thumbs up = Great luck for 97 days



Sub = Awesome luck for 54 years"
CmRih_VtVAs,The music really doesn't work with the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:45 Isn't that Enchantress behind the guy ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"this film needs to be at least 12 hours long to give these amazing characters enough screentime. 

my eyes are ready."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Tráiler ever!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Really? They had to use this song? Good god....this movie is gonna be terrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,epic epic epic omg!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Has got this masterpiece the same story and plots as the animated movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:45 finally slenderman gets his role in a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool = Suicide Squad...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will be great movie!!, I loved this trailer and very good music, they wore..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer provees is no need of inception's horns
CmRih_VtVAs,will Smith as Deadshot?!?!?!  👎👎👎👎👎👎
CmRih_VtVAs,Ironic that the movie about villains has a more vibrant color scheme then the dull dreary look of Batman v Superman and Wonder Woman
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how everyone is really calm and then Captain Boomerang comes along and is totally freaking out!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"first trailer made it look dark and thriller like, now it's more avenger like, i don't understand.."
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please, oh god, please don't let this be a stupid movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,epic
CmRih_VtVAs,the queen song really .... fucken lame im waiting for dvd
CmRih_VtVAs,"This.
Looks.
Stupid.
DC drops the ball, again."
CmRih_VtVAs,Y Cara? why she doesn't is in the descripcion?:vvvv
CmRih_VtVAs,Should get nominated for an Oscar.
CmRih_VtVAs,"check out my beats, on my channel. selling them. I'm a new upcoming producer and need people to hear my work."
CmRih_VtVAs,"WHY ALL THE WAY IN AUGUST, DONT TEASE US SO BAD!!!!!,"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm glad that they're going for a dark yet humorous feel. It shows that DC can do other types of movies (other than depressing explosion-fests)
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie is nothing but a pretty face thogh
CmRih_VtVAs,did deadshot get a tan?
CmRih_VtVAs,This Movie is gonna be in theatres on my birthday!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, I thought this was going to be complete shit.  Fortunately, the marketing department cherry picked the best bits of the movie and put them in this nifty little trailer, in the hopes that I would fall for their bullshit.  It's working."
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie is so hot!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will be like Batman: Assault on Arkham. check here guys http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3139086/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing. Great music choice and fantastic editing. May end up being one of the best movies this year!
CmRih_VtVAs,menudo pedazo de trailer si no fuera por EL PUTO JOKER por dios que es esto!!!!!!!merece más la pena pagar 100 $ por jugar al tetris por ejemplo
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing trailer...can't wait til August!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks cool also if you are watching this subscribe to me
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my new favourite movie and his hasn't come out yet.

CmRih_VtVAs,Bismillah we will not let you go #ripfreddie
CmRih_VtVAs,"The music is the reason i can't take the trailer seriously, gonna watch it tho._."

CmRih_VtVAs,movie looks amazing especially when the hype it with a great  song
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow has dc realized that superhero movies don't have to be super dark?!?! Wake me up please
CmRih_VtVAs,i think i'm in love
CmRih_VtVAs,best... movie trailer... ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer thinks that if it puts Queen on the soundtrack that it will convince me it will be a good movie....well it's working...keep going...
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the guy that pops out of the bag and starts hitting people....
CmRih_VtVAs,still looks like shit. only people who are enjoying this are the ones who have never heard of suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,watched this like 16 times
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Harley's accent
CmRih_VtVAs,DC making people even less excited about bvs lol
CmRih_VtVAs,omg who decided to use this song with this trailer no no no!! why! someone actually got paid for that!
CmRih_VtVAs,Music choice so far is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Это будет охуенно!
CmRih_VtVAs,that ass e.e
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel was good?? U doing ok?? aww don't cry!!
CmRih_VtVAs,So many action and violence... and that is good for that kind of movie... but one thing I don't understand. There is no blood In the whole move. Not a single drop! This is not real! And almost every movie in present time is like that! Except his majesty Tarantino! The one and only!
CmRih_VtVAs,"God dam it Leto your going to ruin this movie for me, with your Pathetic attempt to be joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,Think if the actor who played deadshot in Arrow was deadshot in this movie. Anyways will definitely watch this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally smith finally
CmRih_VtVAs,¡Queen! ❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,"Woooooooooooooow, sooooooo edgy"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer of 2016 so far
CmRih_VtVAs,Any thoughts on who the big bad is? I don't mean The Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Gunna be cool
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm really sorry, but I think this looks like absolute crap. 

When I saw Joker shooting, all I could see was ""Flattop"" from Dick Tracy mixed with James Bond's ""Jaws"".

It was just a generic ass, cringy trailer that Will Smith looks like Droopy Dog in."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't be the only one who thinks this looks like shit?
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad just moved up above Batman V. Superman for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear Star Trek team, this is how you make a good trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 *_The Lazarus Pit!?!_*
CmRih_VtVAs,wow is awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shit 😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Captain Boomerang looks funny af , Harley Looks Perfect , This Convinced me Joker is going to Rock, Katanna Looks badass, Enchantress not sure intrested tho, Rick Flag Meh, Deadshot mixed feelings . Killer Croc should be cool even though i thought it was going to be king shark which is bs, overall looks good can't wait for this to to rock"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, theories on who/what the stretchy armed train wrecking man-thing is?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll wait! We need heroes ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,(39 sec.)That's what happens when you tell somebody they smell like prison sex.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hmmm. The movie itself looks good, I don't know about the Jared Leto/Joker/Marilyn Manson mashup though. The Joker seems kinda stupid from the trailer. It was really the only part I didn't like. His acting looked generic and the makeup looked retarded. They should have had Willam Defoe play Jokster instead."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks epic I can't wait for it because The Suicide Squad is one of my favorite group of bad people in comics.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that some of the wreckage from the Man of Steel fight?
CmRih_VtVAs,Never thought I'd so celebrate Bohemian Rhapsody ever again!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:18 Harley me robo mi mania de soplarme el cabello de esa forma!!
CmRih_VtVAs,debate: deadpool or suicide squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow! I almost didn't recognize Jared Leto as the Joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best trailer I've seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching this trailer! o_O
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best trailer I've seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC IS THE BEST
CmRih_VtVAs,Replay. Replay! REPLAY!
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yael Stone as Harley Quinn...

...

...only in my dreams. 

😕"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG Harley is too adorable in this trailer. Margot Robbie is perfect! and lovin Joker's laugh.
CmRih_VtVAs,I looking forward to the DC universe unfold on the big screen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Much better trailer than the Batman V Superman trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow that actress is so good, she's got Harley's accent on-point, reminds me of Kids WB."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1 word, OMG!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like the most try hard bullshit I've ever seen. Fuck this movie.
Also fuck you for using Queen..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Need to see this movie, it looks amazing!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Robbie's ass cheeks weak af 2:07 👎
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,FINALLY A DC MOVIE THAT DOESN'T TAKE ITSELF SERIOUSLY!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,nice
CmRih_VtVAs,Get Jinxed!
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else already have a huge crush on Harley Quinn??
CmRih_VtVAs,"Question: Who are the ACTUAL villains, the 'suicide  squad' are trying to defeat?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ugh.. tired of everyone asking for the song name..  So here.

Darude - Sandstorm"
CmRih_VtVAs,Soundtrack please
CmRih_VtVAs,músic??????
CmRih_VtVAs,Caraaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs up for Queen. And tbh I like the new look of The Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Русские здесь?)
CmRih_VtVAs,wheres batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ty for queen already got me!!! Mommaaaa just killed a man
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is this so hyped? :o
I've never heard of Suicide Squad.. dont hit me pls :c"
CmRih_VtVAs,You're missing the party Slade!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Like most comic book based movies, it looks stupid as fuck! That and it has the vile racist Will Smith in it (donated $150,000 to an organization that wants to exterminate all white people)."
CmRih_VtVAs,This Jared Leto joker thingy may be good.....but it is NOTHING compared to Heath Ledger's Joker in The dark knight.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still freaking out about this a day later.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker is going to be epic! Can't wait to see the film! :D And thanks for the Bohemian Rhapsody :)
CmRih_VtVAs,TIVE MÚLTIPLOS ORGASMOS NERDS MAMAMIA
CmRih_VtVAs,feelin more like a cash grab than an actual story or plot...
CmRih_VtVAs,is the joker pulling harley out of acid at 1:59? if so do this mean we're getting a harley closer to the new 52? is she using a accent or not? SO MANY QUESTIONS SO LITTLE TIME
CmRih_VtVAs,That rhythmic sound of shells from bullets on 1:49 is fantastic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Gozei
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the look of the movie. It looks really colorful for a R rated hyper violent comic book movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have to admit, the Joker has always been my least favorite thing about this movie so far and seeing him in this trailer has changed my mind."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just like Age of Ultron. 1st trailer was dark and serious, now this trailer is comedy movie. What a fucking joke."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not a fan of Harley's voice BUT i might like her...maybe  lol
CmRih_VtVAs,<3
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"the joker looks terrible, but Harley and deadshot look cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow!!!!! just having a mini geek out, cannot wait to see this :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,did anyone else get goosebumps?
CmRih_VtVAs,"that's holder from ""the killing""😍😍😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's way too early to judge, but based on this trailer, it definitely has a Guardians of the Galaxy feel to it, which I think will be HUGE for the ""DC Cinematic Universe"".."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v Superman...no

Suicide Squad..yes 

why?  This trailer just shows stuff and doesn't give away spoilers like an attention whoring dog"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will chose this role over the role in Independence Day 2!?!? Wtf!
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is amazing!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn turns me on😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect music choice for the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margo Robbie has an undeniable sex appeal and is probably the best visual choice for Harley Quinn I can think of, but doesn't sound like she put any effort into the voice of Harley Quinn and to me...that's a shame.  It's iconic when you think of the character."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know who they are up against like like some dark demon shit sometimes  cant wait to see it!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally the bad guys have their own movie!! 😊😊
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker drives that pink car?! Wtf.....Driving that car, he looks like Justin Bieber:))))))"
CmRih_VtVAs,amo los tacos
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm kind of confused why Cara is in this movie..
CmRih_VtVAs,o gawd...y will smith!! he doesn't suit the character.. :P
CmRih_VtVAs,Can some body explain to me is it some short of XMEN or DC Universe ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie got that butt...
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith as the bad guy. Ok
CmRih_VtVAs,Eh
CmRih_VtVAs,The Harley Quinn though............
CmRih_VtVAs,Soo great trailer :3
CmRih_VtVAs,this the beat tailer
CmRih_VtVAs,wait.....WILL SMITH IS PLAYING    A BAD GUY???!!!?!?!?!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?@??!?!?!?!??!?!??!?!??!??!?!?!??!?!!?!?!!!!!!!?!??!?1?!??!??!???!!!?!?!?!?!??!???.........?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jez harley quinn is sexy af
CmRih_VtVAs,suicide squad looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one who's dying to see this ¿¿!!
CmRih_VtVAs,lame
CmRih_VtVAs,Not a DC fan but this looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,".....ok.

For me it's simple.

•Is he crazy?
*yes*

•Is he killing people? 
*yes*

•Does he still have the traditional pale skin, greenish hair, blood red grin and purple clothing?
*yes, yes, yes and yes*

•Is he deliciously evil? 
*Yas!*

This is the Joker. 
Sure, he may look like he is trying to make a fashion statement. 
Sure, he dresses more thuggishly.
Sure, he drives a groovy, colourful car.

But he is still the Joker. Enjoy him. Welcome change. 

Valar Morghulis"
CmRih_VtVAs,"By the time this comes out, I probably won't give a shit anymore."
CmRih_VtVAs,My money is yours DC/WARNER
CmRih_VtVAs,"Get ready Marvel,  DC is coming to slay and ooohh they shall"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think the villain is Regulus.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 thank me later
CmRih_VtVAs,YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fucking amazing!!! Way better of a trailer than that first one they gave us.
CmRih_VtVAs,hats off to the people who edited this trailer.. great song selection and a great trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,What a fucking trailer didn't see anything like it in a long time
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jarod Leto never doubted you, Joker being my favourite comic book character I can say I'm not disappointed  from what I've seen of him in this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like the best thing since the Dark Knight
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel is for Kids 

and 

DC is for Adults. Nais"
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's iron man?
CmRih_VtVAs,MOST FRENETIC TRAILER EVER ITS VERY COOL
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel bad for all the poor bastards that are going to die before ever seeing this movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"so, is this like Dirty Dozen with comic book characters?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"WOW! Off the walls crazy fun and live action Harley Quinn, what more can you ask for? Definitely better than the recent Batman V Superman trailer. Can't Wait!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I am Still on the fence about Harley Quinn. I guess I will have to watch the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,wowwww!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath Ledger did a fantastic job on his take of a gritty and dark Joker. Now let's see what Jared Leto can do with a more comedic and younger Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst Joker ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Бред
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie is going to be sooooo; Follow me on youtube instagram, soundcloud and twitter and facebook @maliphresh
Im a Christian Rapper and im opening for Da Truth This saturday"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley just isn't coming across as crazy enough in this, to me."
CmRih_VtVAs,🤔👍
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see Joker work together with Batman like in the comic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Terrible song choice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Extra terrestrial, tentacles, possible shape shifting, greenish tint. Government calls in suicide squad to recapture... CURRENT THEORY: it's Martian Manhunter, escaping from area 51."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks alot better than Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody else pause at 2:07  <3 <3 <3 <3
CmRih_VtVAs,http://moneyandtask.com/?refid=76432 check this out guys !!
CmRih_VtVAs,CAN'T WAIT !!
CmRih_VtVAs,And another awesome trailer from DC
CmRih_VtVAs,My god this looks amaZing
CmRih_VtVAs,someone should get a fucking academy award for this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,This comment section gave me cancer.
CmRih_VtVAs,I must be the only the only one unimpressed.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I still think Pauley Perrette with blonde hair would have looked perfect as Harley Quinn.

https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/pauley-perrette-ncis-soundtrack.jpg"
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh yea I forgot will Smith is in this
CmRih_VtVAs,Im here for the music
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer should win an Oscar.
CmRih_VtVAs,I cAnt wait. I love you Harley Quinn ❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is going to be like Turtle and the Rabbit story....
Marvel and DC race.
Marvel had sooo much more lead than DC.
Marvel could have won.
But instead Marvel decided to take a nap since they are soo far ahead.
DC caught up to Marvel.
Marvel woke up from the nap,tried to claim the throne.
But DC pass that FINISH line before Marvel.
DC>Marvel
The End."
CmRih_VtVAs,wish they added more people to it. where the flash? where Killer Frost? where Mr Freeze? where FRIEZA?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 Thank you for the nightmares. I didn't need to sleep tonight anyway.
CmRih_VtVAs,For the first time ever I am going to say that Jai Courtney looks badass...
CmRih_VtVAs,Hayley Quinn needs her own film too
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx Anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hawkeye should die
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait 😭
CmRih_VtVAs,Giovanni Ribisi Needs to be the joker. Watch his facial expressions such as in ted 2 etc...
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad might have it's comedic side to it but THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY! SO DON'T FUCKING RIP THEM OFF AND TRY TO SELL IT AS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else see brainiac at 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,"Shitty scene kid Joker looking like he just got out of emo band show. He's bringing the ""Rawr xD nuzzles"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only thing I seem to not like about all this is still the Joker's look... I can't see myself being afraid of a hipster lookin' douche... I can't even laugh he just looks... sad, and pathetic..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Never had a boner so hard in my life.
CmRih_VtVAs,The timing with the guns amazing 😁
CmRih_VtVAs,Less dramatic and more funny... Guess the other trailer was just shitty.
CmRih_VtVAs,why don't I like this? am I the only one? and I don't even know why....maybe there should have been more of the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I really like the song. Does anyone know the name of the song ?
CmRih_VtVAs,man i cant wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Sound : Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,YUS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,not quite the right song for this... nevermind
CmRih_VtVAs,До Августа так долго ждать. :с
CmRih_VtVAs,XPEHA HET PУCCKИX KOMMETAPИEB?)))
CmRih_VtVAs,"it's look like we know all the characters in this movie, but a different story. 
the quality in creative of the movies is not the same anymore"
CmRih_VtVAs,"At the beginning, you can see Warner Bros. Pikturez and DC Komikz ! And at exactly 01:24 , the guy shooting is named ""Frost"" ! :D 
Yes, I watched the trailer a thousand times pics by pics ! :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 <3 please up gife
CmRih_VtVAs,呃呃呃 没字幕
CmRih_VtVAs,"CANNOT WAIT, I LOVE THE JOKER AND HARLEY"
CmRih_VtVAs,To be honest I had my doubts about this movie when I first heard about it. After seeing this trailer I can confirm that I haven't been hyped about a DC movie since the Dark Knight.
CmRih_VtVAs,Me encanta esa canción😂😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Song Name ? xDDDDDDD
CmRih_VtVAs,Song Name ? xDDDDDDD
CmRih_VtVAs,Til August-_- I won't make it

CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto <3
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 emma watson?
CmRih_VtVAs,Real棒！I wish to see it in China 😘（不知道语法对不对……）
CmRih_VtVAs,who are all these villains????!
CmRih_VtVAs,Her ass though
CmRih_VtVAs,eh.. i dont much like Harley in this. I guess I'm just to attached the original Harley voice. I'm sure it'll be great though.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen — instant win!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is actually doing a good job at playing DeathShot. And can't wait for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I got a feeling this joker is going to be amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,music?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared!!! 👏👏👏👏🃏
CmRih_VtVAs,"not normally my type of film but this does look good,cant wait for it to come out,defo looks like its worth watching"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does Oprah want to assemble a task force of the most dangerous people on the planet? Also Will Smith as a dangerous bad guy..? I can't wait to see how many movie sins this commits.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cara, Will and Jared in one film,
Thank God."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:27 How is that not Tom Hardy wtf!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Success!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait deadshots white what happened ? And why does joker have to have that lame ass grill , like they would allow him to have that in prison lol wtf."
CmRih_VtVAs,And the jokes on you!
CmRih_VtVAs,the best movie in the world!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I found this really enjoyable, the mix of Bohemian Rhapsody and some villains  from the DC universe mixed into some badass explosions (the music and the trailer mix amazingly by both directing and editing the shots) I am definitely seeing this movie, no doubt"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more hype for this movie then Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,It's me or Harley looks like Cersei Lannister?
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name- Bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,**bohemian rhapsody starts playing** me: white people will love this shit
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so exited!!! 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"I didn't like the choice of song the first time I watched this trailer, but when I really listened to how the lyrics were edited, I thought......bravo DC, bravo!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 has to be the best part for me
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be insane! Can't wait! \o/
CmRih_VtVAs,Blasfeman con esta musica
CmRih_VtVAs,god this looks so shit lmao they really ruined the fuck out of this concept didnt they
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder exactly how much Batman is going to play into this movie. It's obviously not a whole lot. but it'll  be interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks incredible!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like this for:
Bohemian Rhapsody
Harley ass
Joker is not as bad as I told."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I gotta say, Jai Courtney stole this trailer... that beer can sip was the best thing in the whole trailer =D

THE HYPE IS ON!"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:40 harley quin is apparently a beasthunter from bloodborne
CmRih_VtVAs,1 hes not ther joker and 2 I came.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is a masterpiece
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck me wheres batman!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ 
Who's gonna shut the fuck up with this shit in 2016?
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the one that destroys the train? 1:43
CmRih_VtVAs,I may cried of happiness a little. Jesus Christ this is a good trailer! The way this has been editted. I LIKE.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Comic Con trailer was more dark; hence more appealing.  Reminded me of the original '91 Batman film.  This trailer, complete with the accompanying Bohemian Rhapsody song, reminds me of the kiddie Batman Forever."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is the BEST
CmRih_VtVAs,"use bohemian rhapsody like song doesnt mean a good movie, just wait for see it..."
CmRih_VtVAs,hmmm ... Ya no parece tan mala :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Watch very very closely coming up on 1:45 , the train scene, WTF is that thing?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I... 

think I'm going to explode, I need to hold onto something, my god, that was brilliant.

Somebody call for help."
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,i don't really see the suicide squad helping anyone except themselvea
CmRih_VtVAs,nice song
CmRih_VtVAs,This > Every comic book movie coming out this year other than Deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be a fun ride!
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 kill me Lord, do not let me suffer anymore."
CmRih_VtVAs,wtf o.o
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this it? I'll pass.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,I got too busy jamming out to Bohemian Rhapsody to pay attention to anything that was happening in the trailer haha
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear Jared Leto - Nailed it. I was skeptical and I am a huge Marvel fan, but dear lord I want to see this soooo bad now."
CmRih_VtVAs,They tainted queens bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEEENNNN!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,really? its bohemian rapsidy by Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared and Margot sure entertain me. I am packing!
And ya they are the 'Bad Guys' - Sure we get it already!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,So the answer to DC competing with Marvel is just to copy Marvel...right down to using a popular song for the trailer in their answer to Guardians...typical DC nonsense
CmRih_VtVAs,This is an abysmal trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What was that? I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry...the voices. I'm kidding...that's not what they really said"". Haha."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're Bad Guys; it's What We Do."""
CmRih_VtVAs,the music only remember me Guardian´s Galaxy hahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,"i know will smith is a good actor n all,but i really enjoyed the actor who played deadshot in the tv show arrow.i thought he was a great fit"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can not wait for this movie to come out but what song is that playing thru out the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,CANT.....STOP......WATCHING.......
CmRih_VtVAs,Overrated.
CmRih_VtVAs,so harley dies in a bath of acid?  1:58
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell. Fucking. Yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol evrybody in the comment section talk about queen ! lol its harley quinn, you retards !!!!!








*grabs popcorn*"
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that is how you build a good trailer! I has my doubts but now I will definitely see this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't look that good.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so much better then the Batman v Superman trailer :D
CmRih_VtVAs,WAY MORE EXCITED NOW THAT I SAW THIS
CmRih_VtVAs,I didnt know how much i wanted to watch this film until I just saw this trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,so... fucking... AWSOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,"make some moneyy!!!
easy af !!

http://moneyandtask.com/?refid=76110"
CmRih_VtVAs,ПИДОРСКИЙ ОТСТОЙ
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad Kung fu panda will destroy this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Where's the Batman when you need him?
Instead they're doing this lame Batman vs Superman crap which I'm not intending to watch!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name ??
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker looks fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wasn't really looking forward to this movie that much, But this trailer is awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Sorry but did not like the song choice for the trailer. Feels like their trying way too hard to copy the Guardians of the Galaxy style with another classic rock song. I tried seeing the trailer without music and honestly it was much better. Don't get me wrong I love Queen. But this song was a wrong choice. Hopefully next trailer has a different song.
CmRih_VtVAs,I must see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,http://moneyandtask.com/?refid=76110
CmRih_VtVAs,make some money with this
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really like the style of this movie.
hopefully this joker is the main antagonist."
CmRih_VtVAs,The blonde girl got me am watching it
CmRih_VtVAs,http://moneyandtask.com/?refid=76110
CmRih_VtVAs,"is watch this instead 

http://moneyandtask.com/?refid=76110"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really had faith in Margot Robbie. But so far I'm really not feeling her interpretation of Harley :( I hope it's better than I think it will be. I know she's a great actress.
CmRih_VtVAs,Chant wait for this movie! Awesome trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet baby jesus!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm kinda disappointed, i was expecting a dark superheroes movie (the other trailer), not a ""normal"" superheroes movie. It looks pretty good tho, but still"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing. This is definitely going to be the best comic book movie ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't know Obama was in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"As someone who has lost almost all interest in BvS after their last trailer, let me just say, this trailer for Suicide Squad looks amazing. Can't wait for this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,You can't go wrong with some god damn Queen!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh god, I think I already like this Joker... More :P. Looks like there'll be less of a mystique and twisted philosophy to him this time and just out n out....Twisted! Have to wait and see but I fuckin love it already lol!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"send $1 for WebMoney please, I will be grateful
Z526619216006"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so hyped for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who the heck are they fighting? Goopy, venom like stuff all over them. Clayface?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"My biggest pet peeve is the Freddie Mercury song, every time I hear that song I think of Wayne's World."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who thinks this looks horrible in comparison to the toon version? Wtf is that casting? Will smith for Deadshot? And who the hell is that on Harley, she sounds terrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,Lo unico bueno que tiene es la musica
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker still looks goofy. But his acting is on point though. I'm impressed! But still looks weird.
CmRih_VtVAs,way did Bing bad
CmRih_VtVAs,this a HOE aint got no eyebrows...What a Tranny
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the maincharacter fro  HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER
CmRih_VtVAs,Really disappointed with Harley. She's gorgeous but she's not Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,"There's so much going on in this trailer yet there's still so little we know about the plot. This is how all trailers should be, I'm super excited for this"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Интересно, сколько Уилл Смит попросил за роль?"
CmRih_VtVAs,LMAOOOOOOO the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,But where's Deathstroke?
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG!
IS THE BEST TRAILER, I VE SEEN IN MY FUCKING LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I CANT WAIT 7 MONTHS ,,,WHO HELPS ME TO CREAT THE TIME MACHINE????"
CmRih_VtVAs,check out 1:23 what a pervert this Joker is.....ASS CLOWN
CmRih_VtVAs,"La peli no sé cómo estará. Pero el trailer, creo que es el mejor trailer que he visto en mi vida!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks amazing, I wish they'd given Harley her Boston accent but at least she's got the attitude down."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm actually really looking forward to this now, love bohemian rhapsody.
Still not a fan of the tattoos though."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wayne's World did it better
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 has potential yet...
CmRih_VtVAs,this Joker screams Cock Sucker.......first Homosexual Joker to go down in history. Thank Hollyweird for ruining the Joker..
CmRih_VtVAs,WOWWWW
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot's Harley is the biggest pile of shit I've ever seen, being a big fan of harley since the beginning this has honestly ruined the character"
CmRih_VtVAs,a video game of this
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought Tom Hardy was going to play captain boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly might be the best super hero movie trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hehehe, I enjoyed this trailer! SHOOT & LAUGH."
CmRih_VtVAs,Я единственный Русский? /
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian EFFING rhapsody?!! uhm.. YES.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst Heroes Ever ?
no, not in my book.
this is the MOST BADASS, UNIQUE, & COOLEST Heroes Ever !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks Good!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,And the Bat is in this as well....wow.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like it's trying to be a gritty version of Guardians of the Galaxy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's like they're some kind of ""suicide squad."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"whose the pyro. the witch girl and the tom hardy looking guy, and the native dude? im only familiar with the green fire guy in the JLU cartoon from a while ago. Also any ideas who they are fighting, and whats happening @ 1:44 with the train who is that?? 1:52 tentacle? sorry for so many questions lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really like this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is like my mind
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the best crazy ass mother fucking trailer of the year.
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats the song name 😅
CmRih_VtVAs,2980 A.R.G.U.S. agents hated this video.
CmRih_VtVAs,HFS! That is THE most epic trailer I've ever seen! The film had better be as good...
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite queen song put into a movie this is going to be good
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks insane i cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody suits the movie so well. 
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm surprised, but I loved that trailer. Looks exciting."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks awesome WB, can't wait to see it 😀"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so sick
CmRih_VtVAs,A DC movie that doesn't look really depressing and moody and instead looks really fun? Count me in!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warner Brothers really out did themselves with this trailer!
 Bohemian Rhapsody fits perfectly, the pace is great and it definitely sets this film apart from other 'hero movie trailers'. Can't wait to see it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG GOD TIER 
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman v Superman > Civil War > Xmen Apocalypse > Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,крутой трейлер
CmRih_VtVAs,it will be a nice movie i think
CmRih_VtVAs,YEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,anytime way better than the girly marvel shit they throw at you these days....love Jared's rendition
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit when did DC learn to have fun with itself?
CmRih_VtVAs,"2,935 haters. must be marvel fans"
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly looks better than Batman v Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Ansiosa demais aqui! 😱 Maravilhoso! Scott 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,la canción más errónea que pudieron aber selecionado
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 thank me later
CmRih_VtVAs,perfecto :D
CmRih_VtVAs,The song made the trailer so much better
CmRih_VtVAs,"idk, bad guys playing good till they go bad again?? but DAMN is HQ hot!! lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,can't fucking wait! the music choice got my too hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks badass
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing how they can make it boring
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker laugh just sounds like hes running outta breath its all wrong and harleys voice is wrong but everything else looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Alright... I wasn't sold initially, but DAMN I looking forward to this."
CmRih_VtVAs,NOTHING REALLY MATTERS TO ME. What a fucking motive.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is everyone ragging so badly on Margot Robbie? She's not going to sound like Harley from the animated shows and movies, because they're cartoons. They're cartoony and silly but that's not what this movie is. Get over it. While I'm also not really happy about her look, it should be expected in the New 52 age. Either way, I'm withholding judgement until the movie has been released, because I think Margot has potential."
CmRih_VtVAs,In 7 months wtf 😤
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if the suicide rate will increase after people see the title of this movie and get it into their heads.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just sitting here and waiting for justice league dark. yes, its confirmed"
CmRih_VtVAs,this does not look good at all
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker laugh is wrong needs to be more like mark Hamill or heath ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,Just watch all the marvel fanboys switch once we start showing our movies 😏
CmRih_VtVAs,The worst heroes more like the Best Heroes!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The music is horribly distracting.
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks too great. DC is on to something big
CmRih_VtVAs,there's something wrong with the view counter guys. its only showing my views i dunno why...
CmRih_VtVAs,"what people see : suicide squad
what i see : HARLEY QUINN !"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, 1 more movie with a pretty model playing like if she was strong, dangerous, bla, bla bla. Charlie's angels? Maybe.

And some funny ""bad guys"" at her side, trying to be cool.

This is too infantial to me. I just lost my time. See ya, kids."
CmRih_VtVAs,That ass
CmRih_VtVAs,That Harley performance.... Tara Strong's throne is in peril.:D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad > Deadpool > Batman V Superman >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> ""Civil War 😉"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'll wait for the movie to see, but Margot Robbie's acting looks cringeworthy as hell!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks like DC's having some fun, finally"
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer alone is 1000000000000  times better than dilwale crap.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this is the 6th time i watch the trailer today
CmRih_VtVAs,this is stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Worst Heroes Ever?"" Who's the one who destroyed buildings and costs thousands of lives just to take down a single villain, and will probably do it again in Dawn of Justice?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everything about the trailer was fantastic,especially the music...Jai Courtney looks hilarious as well"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish dc would have continuity in their movies ,instead of being all over the place.  -_-"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Does anyone else think it's cool that Superhero movies are becoming as varied as the comic books?

It's like you don't have to compare superhero movies to each other anymore because the directors, producers and casts feel like different adaptations of the comics with different ""writers"" and ""artists.""

Hope this opens up opportunities for one-shot superhero movies like ""Superman: Red Son"" or Jason Aaron's ""Punisher: MAX"""
CmRih_VtVAs,One simply does not watch this trailer just once....
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley's voice is wrong
CmRih_VtVAs,You can watch this trailer in 30 different languages Harley is always annoying...must be the actress.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody :)
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone know the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Say hello to the bad guy
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody <3
CmRih_VtVAs,oh fascinating!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope it lives up to the hype.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley quin killed it for me, I probably won't even watch this movie because it's not Harley quin, and you can't tell me other wise, it's not her, it's just not."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Aah! 2:07
That's my favourite part"
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW...haters will hate anything...U can´t say if this It´ll a bad or good movie just watching this cause it´s tricky ....but this it´s a awesome trailer..
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fuck Yeah! 
✊😲"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think diz trailer ws betr Dan dawn f justice
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK, that looks great!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The best movies are usually those we think are awful after their anouncements
CmRih_VtVAs,Most awesomest trailer in a long long time !
CmRih_VtVAs,Actually this is trailer 2
CmRih_VtVAs,why cara ?..
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am sorry but I don't know why people are so hyped for this its like every single Hollywood movie, the same fucking scenario  in every single super heroes movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,IMO it will be this and not Bats V Supes that makes the casual viewer take note of the DC cinematic universe. The former looks bloated and too serious. This looks like Marvels GOTG's mischievous little sister. Can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney channels his inner Shia Labeouf
CmRih_VtVAs,So where are Joker an Harley?? I am asking because these two sorry excuses won't do at all. One look like a 3rd rate meth addicted hooker the other like a Prodigy's frontman little retarded brother.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this going to debut at the Gathering of the Juggalos?  What was that?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not so ecstatic about Jared Leto as the Joker, nor the Joker's look in this movie, but I do want to see this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE LOOKS AWESOME!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"All doubts about Jared Leto's Joker are now gone, he looks AWESOME!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What was Will trying to do there?!""

His best."
CmRih_VtVAs,"the best piece of editing i have seen in a long time, makes me shiver"
CmRih_VtVAs,GETTIN' JIGGY WIT IT!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I gotta say , this trailer is amazing , and I'm sure the film is gonna be as amazing too , 
BUT it didn't blow my ming like the civil war trailer ...."
CmRih_VtVAs,this joker is going to have a lot of good quotes cant wait for this this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing trailer! Looking forward to watching this more than Superman v Batman!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to watch this badboy!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is sick!!! It hasn't revealed anymore about the plot that the previous trailers have while still showing us enough of what's in store!!! CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'cant wait to show you my fucking toys !
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 I feel like is gunna be the part of the movie I want to see the most lol but I really wish Harley kept her accent ..
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"We live in an amazing  time people,DC has stepped up"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn shame heath ledgers not around anymore,wouldve loved to see him play the joker in this movie,wouldve been phenomenal honestly"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks like it's going to be a LOT of fun!
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome I'm gonna watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,Second song name plz !!!! 🙏🏽
CmRih_VtVAs,I second the guy who said that using Bohemian Rhapsody was is cheating. Hell you could put that song on Sharknado's trailer and it would look awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Much better trailer that the last one made for Batman v Superman :-)... by the way Harley Quinn looks awesome and gorgeous :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,hi
CmRih_VtVAs,They went GotG style. Not original but it's cool anyways.
CmRih_VtVAs,Euh ok tout les méchants de Batman mais sans Batman...WTF?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow I suddenly started loving Jared Letto Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect müthiş bir fragman olmuş BvS den sonra 2016 da en çok beklediğim film Dc Comics bu sene Marvele fark atacak gibi
CmRih_VtVAs,Wheres batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,"AHHH YES 
THE SONG; JSFBKDLABS
THE ACTORS; SKDBUQJS 
EVERYTHING; AJEJEKFNBFKWNSNDNDNDNDNXMDNKDNDN"
CmRih_VtVAs,hdfuv
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer is pretty nice. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie can play any character.
CmRih_VtVAs,"What? I thought using this song was total cheese. This movie seems kind if dumb now, I didn't realize it was a parody.."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 dat ass tho
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be awful. Mark my words.
CmRih_VtVAs,AMAZING!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody! What else can one ask for?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seems like there gonna start the first half with the squad then ignore them for Harley and the joker 

Actually joker just shouldn't be in this movie at all"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hiper hipe
CmRih_VtVAs,"really great trailer and I awesome song choice. Queen for life. Jared Leto looks great as Joker, love the laugh. I hope that the way he looks works in the movie, if it does then I'll be extremely happy"
CmRih_VtVAs,That was horrible
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish heath ledger wasn't dead, then he could be this movie's joker and this movie would 100 times more bad ass then it already will be"
CmRih_VtVAs,song?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Please... someone... stop me.... I can't stop watching....
CmRih_VtVAs,primer comentario en español 🍻
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, DC has now become Marvel thanks to Warner Bros. >:("
CmRih_VtVAs,"so unfitting music, just trying to ride marvel using oldie soundtracks wave."
CmRih_VtVAs,هاي
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeap. I'm gonna stick with Marvel... Again.
CmRih_VtVAs,Da nea astept
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fanboys are so desperate that are trying to make a war between DC's own movies lol. Man, both are gonna be great. Both are gonna give money to Warner Bros. Both are from the same universe. And that's it, I don't care what is gonna be the best. I want them both to be succcesful"
CmRih_VtVAs,"so far, I'm loving will Smith's portrayal of deadshot in this. gonna be a fun year :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is among the most well made trailers I've seen in my life. Those neon rainbow logos... dammit I am EXCITED.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is going to be far better than ""do you bleed, you'll"" superman vs batman shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait... was Harley Quinn reading an Spn novel?
CmRih_VtVAs,Better Than Batman Vs Superman in my opinion.
CmRih_VtVAs,The horse heroe is Deadpool. asdfjglglahdld <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"why a fucking queen song ?
it's cool tho"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whoa this trailer is magnificent, surely this is one of the best trailers out there."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's watching it?
CmRih_VtVAs,hoping it wasn't gonna be so lighthearted....disappointed tbh

CmRih_VtVAs,What a stupid idea for a movie.....what a stupid idea to put will smith in said movie.....what stupid looking characters ESPECIALLY THE JOKER.....ugh...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this trailer sold it, i wasn't sure if i was gonna go see it but after this trailer i am pretty sure !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Se ve perra haber q tal cuando salga ojito
CmRih_VtVAs,who the hell is that girl in that bathtub?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Really has a guardian of the galaxy vibe, which isn't a bad thing, and I'm sure it's going to be very different from GOTG. Honestly wasn't looking forward to this movie much but now I am. A lot more than I'm looking forward to Batman and Superman and Wonder woman vs Doomsday."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope this movie really is just crazy. And not the bad crazy, the good unique crazy. Intentional crazy."
CmRih_VtVAs,Frist trailer was good this one was shit. Even with the queen song.
CmRih_VtVAs,норм
CmRih_VtVAs,I just have a nerdgasm...
CmRih_VtVAs,DC ain't fuckin around.This trailer is amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The girl reminds me of jinx form League of legends, proof Rito controls the world"
CmRih_VtVAs,Shouldn't it be just one episode? Judging by their name
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like it's going to be a great DC movie! I'm more excited for it then BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,i want to see harly dance  to lords of acid out comes the evil
CmRih_VtVAs,I can think of something fun to do with you cara.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have to wait til August? T_T damnit man, it's bad enough waiting til 2017 for Star Wars."
CmRih_VtVAs,joker look promising.
CmRih_VtVAs,Drugs?
CmRih_VtVAs,Love how Margo Robbie bends over at 2:07.
CmRih_VtVAs,That... Was an awesome trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Needs...More...Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,YO SOLO PENSE ES QUEEN!!
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY FUCK JARED
CmRih_VtVAs,"""we're bad guys its what we do"" never did harly or joker explain themselves a joke is not funny if you have to explain it."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one the best F...KING trailer !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,its fucking amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks so cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Hey Leute ! Abonniert mich*
für frische Let's Plays , Commentaries , Gameplays
und bald evtl JMC News!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait! I wasn't really liking Jared Leto's Joker but after watching this, I like him! And that laugh too!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait!! I've loved every version of the Joker, Mark Hamill, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger and looks like Jared Leto will be on that list as well come summer!! :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie is so damn fine and in a fucked up way, her being psychotic makes her hotter."
CmRih_VtVAs,"So set in the same universe as Batman v Superman and released after. Any clues to what they are going up against villain wise, something left from the BvS battle. All this going on, where are the heroes"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hm... mixing your trailer with popular, older songs... this trailer kind of gives me Guardians of the Galaxy flashbacks."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't understand all the hate on Margot Robbie, i mean she's not my first choice for Harley AT ALL, but i think she did a good job with her lines in the trailer, quite well delivered, a shame that the lines are quite bad, makes it look like she's trying to hard  to look like comic book Harley."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who got excited when Queen Started playing?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney will be the underdog and steal the show!

In Courtney we trust!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I had to watch two times because of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is gonna kill batman v superman in the Box office
CmRih_VtVAs,im soo going to the first showing of this dresses as joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ahhhhh, can't wait to see!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Killer Croc looks so much better as Doomsday from BvS, I like it that they don't used cgi for him :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Feels like something that you'd watch whilst on acid. On a side not; Margot might not have top billing. But she is gonna to steal the show, for sure!
When The Joker says ""Oh, I'm not gonna kill ya"". ""I'm just gonna hurt you really, really...bad"". He's saying this to Harley and gives her a lobotomy. This explains why she is, the way she is, in this version."
CmRih_VtVAs,where was the green goblet?
CmRih_VtVAs,♥♥♥♥♥♥
CmRih_VtVAs,The girl (crazy one) reminds me of the girl from LolyPop Chainsaw
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, so, joker tortures Harley, she hates him, he saves her and romance, that's what I got"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Монстры на каникулах чтоли?
CmRih_VtVAs,hope all these super hero movies don't turn to shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"I absolutely love the look of this, it looks crazy and very comic book. Glad their taking a risk with this one. Yes the effects aren't the greatest YET (we are 6 months before release) but I think that kinda adds to it."
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck yes daddy
CmRih_VtVAs,looks fun as fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,wow they showed a trailer without spoiling the entire movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really want to like this new Joker but I just can't. It just looks horrible. Jared's a great actor, no doubt, but I still don't think it could have been so much better than it actually looks."
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman V Superman is still gonna suck
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think this Joker will be awesome, not better than Heath Ledgers Joker character but still awesome. He's like the Joker before Heath Ledger's Joker became all dark and moody, and before the scars on his face. I think he will do well but still everybody has their preference of Batman's I heard some ppl say they liked the Tim Burton Batman version better than Christopher Nolan's. Michael Keaton was great but I mean come on, somebody's gonna love whatever version and somebody's gonna hate it. All in all, let's just enjoy the entertainment for what it is."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This made me cry.
Was never much into heroes so this is lovely :')"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:55 yeah that looks like Clint Eastwood young version or his son ???
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was Boomin
CmRih_VtVAs,FREDDIE MERCURY
CmRih_VtVAs,"Top of my ""hype list"" now."
CmRih_VtVAs,wow just wow....
CmRih_VtVAs,"seriously stop asking for the song name, its obviously darude sandstorm"

CmRih_VtVAs,Epicness at its finest!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,2K dislikes from hard core marvel fanboys lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Joker and Harley finally get their own movie"" (fan girls)."
CmRih_VtVAs,Couldn't stop smiling while watching
CmRih_VtVAs,This is just epic! Everything cool in one video...
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who's freakinv out because WHERE IS HARLEY'S ACCENT?!
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant wait :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Comic-con teaser didn't sell me at all. This just looked like a lot of fun. Isn't using Bohemian Rhapsody cheating?
CmRih_VtVAs,"oooh can't wait !! 
and Queen as music for the trailer... this can't go wrong!! hahaha"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody the only reason I enjoyed the trailer so much and Robbie's ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,The cut and music mixing could have been better. Nice trailer overall nonetheless.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm calling it
This movie will be WAY better than BatVSupes"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Посмотрите 2 видео, вдохновляет. Показывает всю жестокость нашего мира... Мы помним..."

CmRih_VtVAs,Looks dope. *headbanging like Wayne's World*
CmRih_VtVAs,"Еб*ть, за 16 часов 4 лимона просмотров О_о"
CmRih_VtVAs,this video has only been out a day and it already has 4 million views. you know what that says. Everyone is waiting for this
CmRih_VtVAs,Fantastic trailer. This looks like the first DCEU film that absolutely can't fail.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36
CmRih_VtVAs,that shit is whack. why the hype?
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer didn't quite do it for me as compared to the comic con one. Hate to be one of 'those' guys. Hoping that the movie will be fantastic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Now WB almost can be forgiven for that godawful BvS second trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto as The Joker is freaking awesome !
CmRih_VtVAs,sub =sub
CmRih_VtVAs,*Esse filme vai ser do caralho*
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen : Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,will this be linked to batman vs superman movies universe. Also does the Gotham series fit in with the universe like agents of shield does with Marvel or is it just a standalone.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody is one of my favorite songs of all time, and it fits perfectly with this trailer- I am definitely going to watch this movie when it comes out."
CmRih_VtVAs,Froze
CmRih_VtVAs,hoping Panic! At The Disco do a song for this
CmRih_VtVAs,"How, exactly, did people NOT like this!?"
CmRih_VtVAs,for real how I am gonna wait 6 months 😢😢😢😢😢
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was hard as bricks.
CmRih_VtVAs,I really looove Harley scene at 0:53👏
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:58 Yo, if DC makes another spoiler trailer I swear to God..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool and This
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,Gonna be the best movie of the year
CmRih_VtVAs,This was FUCKING BADASS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker from New 52 on screen. I. Love. It.
CmRih_VtVAs,movie featuring jinx from league of legends
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith has a bigger ass then she does
CmRih_VtVAs,Quien más habla español?
CmRih_VtVAs,WoW¡
CmRih_VtVAs,harley and deathstroke look like crap. everything else looks pretty good.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's going to take me a minute to adjust to the fact that Harley doesnt have her classic accent in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks bloody fucking stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,YEEEESSSSSS Cara is in it
CmRih_VtVAs,what a stupid fucking movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:28 Damn! Hear that laugh, defintely this is the joker!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The new Joker and Quin are amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,people care about upcoming movies more than actual world problems that are threatening this planet....
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,looks pretty fucking cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Hit like if you love Muslims...
CmRih_VtVAs,as soon as I heard bohemian rhapsody it gave me goosebumps even before i watched the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen! They couldn't have picked a better song than this one. I haven't watched a no i.e. in Imax in years but I am definitely watching this one there. I have really big expectations so i hope its good.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not hopeful for this movie--neither its substance or level of enjoy-ability.  It seems to be flirting with the quality of 1997's ""Batman & Robin""--cheesy, lots of action but with little intensity, over-the-top, lame dialogue, trying way too hard.  After Heath Ledger's incomparable interpretation and portrayal of the Joker, Jared Leto's seems (just from this trailer) forced, unbelievable.  Margot Robbie is not strong enough as an actress to pull of the character of Harley Quinn: she's just a pretty blonde with heavy make-up and saying crazy things.  The film is definitely going to walk a fine line between too-much and just-enough, but it already seems to veer toward the former.  We'll see.  Let me close by saying: I could be totally wrong, and maybe it's just the trailer that's over-the-top."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuk!  I think I'm gonna burst....I cannot wait for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is nobody talking about brianiac being in the movie ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"@konrad751 It's just funny how you people keep saying this is like Guardians of the Galaxy, I had 0 GOG vibes while watching this and it has nothing to do with GOG , I enjoyed GOG, but just because it was handled with humor, that doesn't mean every movie that does, is like it .-."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the guy at 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the art in the shop window by Ninja (from Die Antwoord?)
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is going to be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,This joker neither looks menacing nor like a formidable foe to any crimefighter. An adolescent flamboyant look.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is art
Marvel is a product"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow we need this squad to soften corporate scum and banksters!
CmRih_VtVAs,"ANALYSIS OF JOKER:
Jack Nicholson=gangster
Heath Ledger=anarchist
Jared Leto=play boy"
CmRih_VtVAs,the song makes it the best trailer that ever made!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't Britt this up Britta
CmRih_VtVAs,es una cancion de qeen
CmRih_VtVAs,This is joker and harley Quen's Story Right ore false
CmRih_VtVAs,oh yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,disappointing.. was this made by Disney?
CmRih_VtVAs,"if you love queen, like this!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Love that song. Went perfect with the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 Seems like the film might be including Harley's origin?
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevingne is in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn don't convince me...
CmRih_VtVAs,Хуита
CmRih_VtVAs,"at 2:09 that better not be DS, I swear to god if it is."
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,This basically boils down to me as whether or not Will Smith can save the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow. What a complete tone change from the first trailer. Must say though, I liked the darker tone of the first one, and hope they don't turn this movie into a typical action-comedy."
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who are all those guys? Joker, Harley, Killer Croc and Deadshot, but who are the others?"
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looked so fucking good
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone please tell me the name of this song.. ???
CmRih_VtVAs,i h8 how this joker looks
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:13 deadshot (bad guy) says ""lets go save the world ""......??? this movie is going to be a COLOSSAL fuckup."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06...
CmRih_VtVAs,the song must know tell me
CmRih_VtVAs,marg Robbie brother watches wolf of wall street and jerks off
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith has had a lot of flops as of late.  This may just break him out of his slump.
CmRih_VtVAs,DC's own Guardians of the Galaxy..
CmRih_VtVAs,Suckz
CmRih_VtVAs,That was a pretty short movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"At 2:07 a t-shirt in the background reads ""si vis pacem, para bellum."" which means ""if you want peace, prepare for war.""

Just thought that was a cool find. :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks like good chaotic fun! While everyone is complaining about Joker, Harley and Deadshot's portrayals, I can tell I'm going to be thoroughly entertained by this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,August???? noooooooo what about March instead?
CmRih_VtVAs,lame
CmRih_VtVAs,#Sqaud Goals
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN!!! 💕 I couldn't help but sing along 😊
CmRih_VtVAs,"quick break down of the team.
A skilled shooter
A cannibal croc
An Aussie with serious anger problems
A tatoo lover with pyrokinesis
A weird person
all pretty much lead by a Crazy Bitch  (don't take that the wrong way, I love harley)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto is an AMAZING Actor and will do MORE than JUSTICE in the role of the JOKER. He looks perfect for the role, has the charisma and is an Academy Award winner....he is more than qualified to play the Joker.   Watch out Marvel.....DC is coming for you!"
CmRih_VtVAs,It is cumming and i came. Best trailer of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this is a good trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,caramba esse trailer é um grande spoiler.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen's song sold the trailer in Big. WOW!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,what song did they use
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know I have a very unpopular opinion but I still don't like Jared Leto playing the Joker, I hate his look. Maybe because I don't like change and I'm afraid to see the outcome and the future of the Joker. Idk, comment and call me an idiot for not having the same opinion as you now!"
CmRih_VtVAs,im happy
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Joker pushes Harley Quinzel into the chemicals.   
At 1:58 he dives in after her.  At 1:59 rises Joker with Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like this trailer better than the teaser it is probably more true to the tone of the actual movie, the first trailer was too serious."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like saints row
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks CRAXZY, GOOD!!! I WILL GO TO SEE IT!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,i knew jared would be great i was faithfull and this just looks great
CmRih_VtVAs,so now im assuming its gonna be pg-13
CmRih_VtVAs,Floki would make a better joker than this leto guy
CmRih_VtVAs,Give the editor a rise!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching this trailer. Here's hoping the movie will be amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,how can people unlike this 😒
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm ready
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is just Ordinary! What's so special about his character?
CmRih_VtVAs,¸this looks great
CmRih_VtVAs,"what more a fan ask for, the suicide rhapsody"
CmRih_VtVAs,this film looks SO bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seeing this trailer makes me appreciate Heath Ledger's performance as Joker even more. Also this chick sounds nothing like Harley Quinn, she just sounds...well, stupid. I'll pass on this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,song used from 1:37 ??
CmRih_VtVAs,captain boomerang is my spirit animal
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone notice the joker diving in to a vat of chemicals to save Harley? 1:57
CmRih_VtVAs,"They should shot a scene where Joker shot a man in the head and sing ""mama,just killed a man and so on! That would be fucking awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,not dark enough
CmRih_VtVAs,Круто
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the most popular teaser in Bollywood raees sharukah khan
CmRih_VtVAs,MARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow, the music in the trailer didn't fit at all."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why wasn't Will Smith nominated for his work in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Take notes, Batman V Superman trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,They used the Bohemian Rhapsody. Im in love!
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie. Best Harley Quinn ever
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 OH YEA
CmRih_VtVAs,The blonde chick is already annoying
CmRih_VtVAs,Been waiting for this movie since it has been announced!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this just Fanta sea?
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool trailer shitty music I'm tired of cheesy classic songs on movies fucking annoying
CmRih_VtVAs,что я Блять только что посмотрел?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im seeing some resemblance to shaun of the dead here :

CmRih_VtVAs,"lol people ssaying that sq is going to be better than Bvs ahhahahahahhahaha, the only good things in this movieis going to be the joker and  harley quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,kreizi huinya
CmRih_VtVAs,"Poor Marvel, they have nothing to match DC now, DC won end of story"
CmRih_VtVAs,"well, that was a crap advert. Last one was better.Like a bad version of Wayne's world."
CmRih_VtVAs,Airlift one of the best movie of  Bollywood it challenge Hollywood movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"the song makes the trailer so much better, but the movie will still rock."
CmRih_VtVAs,More proof at how decadent Ameriker has become. Pure trash!
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you think Killer Croc looks wussy/terrible, go play the Arkham games (or Google his evolution). The mutation that plagues him looks like ""Lizard Man"" at first, but he becomes a towering monster later."
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK. The first trailer was like a mild breeze against my face, not unpleasant, but not memorable. THIS TRAILER WAS LIKE A WILD TECHNICOLOR STORM OF HOLY FUCK that grabbed me by the collar, shook me, and yelled ""Go and see this movie!!!""
I wasn't feeling the hype, NOW I AM!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I would hate if someone in comments say ""whats the song called""...you live under a rock"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The end of the trailer got me rollin on the ground laughing. I fucking love Harley, can't wait till the movie comes out."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I would hate if someone in comments say ""whats the song called""...you live under a rock"
CmRih_VtVAs,"2 words for this trailer? Ok, MAMA MIA"
CmRih_VtVAs,"A really good trailer, every character got screen time...oh wait....never mind....Katana literally gets nothing. We literally know nothing about her or have seen any scenes of her talking. She's the first Asian character as a ""main character"" in any DC/Marvel movie. I wish that they'd show more of her :/"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best looking film in a long time!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Eh..I don't know. I don't like the way The Joker looks.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn, the characters look and seem well casted! This movie is gonna be great! Harley is gonna so fun to watch I can just tell!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Хрень
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the coolest and most original looking comic book movie ever. I like when Hollywood takes chances. If WB does more stuff like this, they can overtake Marvel"
CmRih_VtVAs,Are they fighting some kind of alien invasion?
CmRih_VtVAs,The point that this Movie takes place in the BVS universe is even more  EPIC. 2016 is  going to be best year of every comic book geeks life. lol we are going to tell our grandkids about this year. lol
CmRih_VtVAs,ok Joker = Super rich psychopath   sure ill play
CmRih_VtVAs,Это божественно !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,screeeeeeeeech
CmRih_VtVAs,Now let's see if the marketing for the film is excellent because this looks incredible!!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC'S version of Guardians of the Galaxy I'm sold
CmRih_VtVAs,"Leto is cool and all, but he can't hold anything up to Heath Ledger"
CmRih_VtVAs,thought thats Hardy on preview pic... was rly disappointed..
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else has read the entire comic book series?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Love how Cap'n Boomerang snaps open the energy drink all paranoid XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Would've liked to hear this done to the tune of We Will Rock You. Boh Rhap is a good choice but WWRY is better.
CmRih_VtVAs,E P I C !
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the COOLEST trailers I've seen!
CmRih_VtVAs,good soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is fit af
CmRih_VtVAs,"That isn't the Harley Quinn I expected to see, come on boys, this will be the first apparition of she in cinemas!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"holy fuck they choose the maximum cringe Harley Quinn. the one that's just ""QUIRKY AND RANDUM XDDD"" instead of the actually fucked up Harley Quinn.
thanks Zack Snyder, you goofy fuck."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone get a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe from the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,Это было божественно
CmRih_VtVAs,is this a comedy
CmRih_VtVAs,So good I watched the trailer twice.
CmRih_VtVAs,Y de pronto un comentario en español.
CmRih_VtVAs,this actually look awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love Bohemian Rhapsody(CLASSIC), but whoever thought this would be a great combination was on something. The tone and tempo does not compliment the trailer. Hate to compare......but the music in the trailers of Avengers 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy was most fitting."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queeeeennnn!!!!!!!!!! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith  my favorite actor
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 best part xD
CmRih_VtVAs,awsum! Coolest trailer since GOTG
CmRih_VtVAs,Seems like Will is playing Hancock again. Everything else looked good.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is doing so much more for me than the first one, or even BvS for that matter."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks awesome! don't like the new joker look though.
CmRih_VtVAs,So many nerdgasms happening in my body
CmRih_VtVAs,mi cancion favorita junto a una de las peliculas que mas espero.... ansiedad en crecimiento ya quiero verla... #suicidesquad #queen
CmRih_VtVAs,вот это трэээш
CmRih_VtVAs,"100% hate the Hot Topic style Joker in this, but should be a fun movie regardless."
CmRih_VtVAs,is this game on PC or not?
CmRih_VtVAs,"My god, Queen was the shyt."
CmRih_VtVAs,The part where the guy opens the can is very satisfying how it syncs in with the music
CmRih_VtVAs,THE HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks SO much better than Batman vs Superman. Excellent teaser and now an excellent trailer. Win win. Suicide Squad > Dawn Of Justice & Civil War.
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is watching this in 2016 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,'I should show you my toys'
CmRih_VtVAs,"я умоляю студию которая будет делать дубляж, сделать его нормальным"
CmRih_VtVAs,I haven't been addicted to watching a trailer in a while.
CmRih_VtVAs,Кто русский - лайк )
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, I mean..I didn't hate it. I just don't like it when movies do that. They make trailers completely different from the previous ones. Like Fantastic Four was made to look gritty..then it was made to look funny..then kinda in the middle. Suicide Squad was originally made to look Badass and gritty..this trailer was like an executive at DC saw Guardians of the Galaxy and was like ""Yeah, let's do that"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Waht a time to be a DC fan, BvS, Suicide Squad and the Justice League is coming baby, sorry marvel, i like you, but looks like DC movies is going to blow up everybody's mind!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Darude - Sandstorm was such a great song choice!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks pretty good except for Harley Quinn who is cringey af
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,0:10 Harley quinn Reading tarzan with margot robbie on it
CmRih_VtVAs,i came for the trailer. stayed for the music. still nice trailer :)
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the BGM
CmRih_VtVAs,great movie + incredible song = awesomeBohemian Rapsody a master piece
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to be a character in this movie. they looks awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Слава Украине!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This film looks bad, like so bad.
But its so unapologetic for being bad that I kinda wanna throw it a bone. Ya get me? Its like when your dumb little brother makes a shitty art project and shouts ""I'M A REAL ARTIST NOW!!"" and all I can do is rub his head and go ""Of course you are!"" in the most condescending tone I can think of.

Also being ironically edgy doesn't stop you from being cringey Suicide Squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone please tell me who is that going against the train.. in 1:44 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"если бы  судить по мульту , то Русский умирает первым . Надеюсь в фильме не так ."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so badass!!! Omg!!! This might be the best film of this year ....
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad > civil war
CmRih_VtVAs,Casi me corro cuando escuché Bohemian rhapsody :'v
CmRih_VtVAs,"The worst heroes ever, LOL. xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Brasil???
CmRih_VtVAs,"Congrats - besides Rock of Ages, this is one movie trailer that I'm planning to watch its movie when it comes out. Best song choice, hoping the movie lives up to the song's standard."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen – Bohemian Rapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't decide if this looks awesome or dumb... PLEASE BE AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,EU TO TREMENDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
CmRih_VtVAs,love harley <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Never thought I will put a MOVIE TRAILER on repeat.... Is something wrong with me!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why are people comparing this movie with BvS? Both movies have different themes and marketing aims.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody ;)))
CmRih_VtVAs,That ZEF art in the store background tho'
CmRih_VtVAs,его че ждать до августа ахренеть как долго
CmRih_VtVAs,all aboard the hype train.
CmRih_VtVAs,No Cara in credits?
CmRih_VtVAs,song name plz
CmRih_VtVAs,Better be GOOD.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm playing arkham knight right now and Harley's voice in here really disturbs me.
CmRih_VtVAs,harley qwin you are great
CmRih_VtVAs,https://www.gofundme.com/skhquyfx?utm_source=internal&utm_medium=email&utm_content=CTA_view_campaign&utm_campaign=donation_receiptv5
CmRih_VtVAs,:O
CmRih_VtVAs,Quinn's voice sucks it's just her regular voice
CmRih_VtVAs,WILL FUCKING SMITH!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Lets go save the whirl."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"I keep hearing Comic Book Guy from The Simpson's saying ""Worst movie adaption of a comic book EVER!""the entire time I watched this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker talking to Todd around the 1:20 mark? Would be a great tie in considering the next Batman movie is rumored to adapt the Under the Red Hood story arc
CmRih_VtVAs,"what does the dude say after he says ""your going somewhere very bad"""
CmRih_VtVAs,what song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"does anybody know the songs they played with this trailer? If so let me know, thanks."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't Wait Possibly Movie Of The Year Right Here!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v Superman comic con trailer v Suicide Squad Trailer?
Who did it better?
Do You Bleed? Or We're Bad Guys."
CmRih_VtVAs,what a great trailer! music fits strangely well to it haha
CmRih_VtVAs,"AMAZING  ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ Cmon, this is the glory!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 Prototype ? (Game)
CmRih_VtVAs,this was fucking crazy though
CmRih_VtVAs,"great trailer  for these reasons
1 queen plus superheroes two of my favorite things 
2 they didn't reveal to much in this trailer like that might have done in the batman vs superman we still don't know much about this movie the villian or the plot which makes us want to know more and see the next trailer and this does remind me of guardians of the galaxy( I mean that in the best way) with the 70s music this is going to be good 👏👏👏👏👍👍"
CmRih_VtVAs,"robbie sucks, apart from that this might be a ok movie, We'll see."
CmRih_VtVAs,so whos gonna die first?
CmRih_VtVAs,This has got to be one of the best song choices for a trailer EVER! And this has to be one of the best trailers ever! SO HYPED!
CmRih_VtVAs,Badass
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks shit
CmRih_VtVAs,OK I'm totally hyped for this film!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I want this because joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,Gotta have that clutch
CmRih_VtVAs,"Good trailer, doesn't spoil much, but I felt the song overcheeses it a little"
CmRih_VtVAs,foda
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the trailer ....superb...must watch
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is this son of a bitch using a earring? 1:53  o.o Why gold chains, gold rings and so many tatoo's? WTF"
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN's BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY AS THE Trailer Theme! *Laughs Hysterically*
CmRih_VtVAs,UUGGGHHHHH FUCK YES!!!!! I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THIS EPICSNESS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,TÁ FAVORAVEL D++++++++
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like shit. Farewell.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley is so crazy, it's almost adorable."
CmRih_VtVAs,This has partly restored my faith in DC
CmRih_VtVAs,This is fucking awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody else not hear Harley's accent? That's one of the best parts about her!
CmRih_VtVAs,I never liked joker harley neither the others so this movie is lame for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ai crl esse filme vai ser fodaa 😍🙌😎
CmRih_VtVAs,It would be even better if it was Rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,soo who's the bad guy
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Movie. Ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm more excited for this than I am BVS. It seems like BVS is trying to be a commercial for the Justice League, while this seems like they're actually trying to make a movie. If you guys know what I mean. I am worried about Jai Courtney being in the movie, because I seen him in Terminator 5 and I thought he was bland."
CmRih_VtVAs,Just in time for my birthday!
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks like it's going to be on par with previous DC films like STEEL starring shaq and tim burtons SUPERMAN LIVES with nicholas cage. 

good thing freddie mercury is dead, at least he doesn't need to hear bohemian rhapsody being used to shill this shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,po
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish Heath Ledger were still alive, then we might see him play The Joker in this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I will say this, I was a doubter to Jared Leto's Joker, but after watching this, it looks like the same joker we all know and love, with just a more thuggish look...."
CmRih_VtVAs,Definitely the best of this trailer is the song.
CmRih_VtVAs,genial !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,thums up
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a Marvel Comics fan, but I will be watching this movie. It looks really fun! Is there anything I should know about Suicide Squad, without me looking them up online??"
CmRih_VtVAs,but keep a fums up and share if u want but fumms up just in case :)
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see it  how know the songs
CmRih_VtVAs,Zack Snyder please take some notes
CmRih_VtVAs,They put Bohemian Raphsody. I am now officialy in love with DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool > Suicide Squad > BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,Que guay se ve la peli
CmRih_VtVAs,0:38 Me when I wake up
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm fucking dying the whole day fuck this is insane
CmRih_VtVAs,i like it when she leans forward
CmRih_VtVAs,I think they try to stop joker but Harley goes off with him instead and that is when batman stops him
CmRih_VtVAs,"Alors sa, sa c'est un film il faut que je vois"
CmRih_VtVAs,What character is Will Smith?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is how you mix a fucking awesome classic song, with some footage and make ""The Trailer""."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm just not feeling this. And I think that comes from Harley and the joker. The joker might be good for me, but the Harley chick just doesn't do it for me. The voice just does not fit at all. I guess all the animated movies and games of batman have spoiled me in that aspect"
CmRih_VtVAs,Worlds most awesome superhero ehh superbadass movie in the world :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks so fun, cant wait !! harley is like me as a comics character thats cool"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just want more Captain, give me more Captain"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie sexy af
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is gonna suck and I think I've already seen the cartoon version.
Also wait till the second trailer, it will show you the rest of the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,cadê os Brs?
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury would be proud!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,God damn Leto' Joker looks creepy. that shot when he is laughing in a tux while shooting a gun...
CmRih_VtVAs,For some reason I think this will be DCs guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,the joker looks BS
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm really digging what they did with Enchantress!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""lets go save the world"" did u have to say that? really? argh so tired of that line -.-"
CmRih_VtVAs,Way too much Will Smith in this for my liking.
CmRih_VtVAs,"god i wish this was rated R
it would have been epic
too bad it's PG-13"
CmRih_VtVAs,FUUUUUUCK is Harley Quinn HOOOOOT ! :O
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh god can't wait anymore
CmRih_VtVAs,its sick well sick=cool
CmRih_VtVAs,ca fait peur
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks terrible 

JK

It looks amazing and wayy better than BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd Mary Harley Quinn I love that crazy bitch
CmRih_VtVAs,she Look like Jinx ;d
CmRih_VtVAs,i think jared leto is still too handsome for joker
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is in the beginning?
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love Harley's actress
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait..i have to wait til august.... :(
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 1:44: I think it might give some insight into who (or what) the actual villain might be. Some sort of magical tree-resembling meta perhaps?
Comment below, let me know!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn seems really forced and poorly acted, other than that it looks good."
CmRih_VtVAs,"to be honest, i thought the first ever trailers of B V S and Suicide squad made the films seem so dark and powerful and now we so two comedic trailers. dont get me wrong the films look great but now i just think it isnt going to be as serious, dark and intense as the first trailers made it out to be. Batman v superman, you end up seeing them team up so that spoiled it and this....i guess it makes sense for them to do a comedic trailer for bad guys. just first trailer made it look even better.......just my opinion."
CmRih_VtVAs,Already a disappointment
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be Epic Fail
CmRih_VtVAs,woooohooooo!!! caan't wait to see it! 🎉🎊
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok hands down the best trailer of the year... now please please please dear movie, don't let me down! ;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,what the hell!?!? I have to wait till august to see this master piece of a movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Clint eastwood's son totally ruined it for me
CmRih_VtVAs,"People bitching about the actors for each role and character are wrong but come on most of them are pretty spot on, the only thing i can feel was unneccesary was the harleys voices scene (never heard of her actually hearing voices) wich is a minor detail that no-one actually cares about, and for croc as long as he isnt cgi i couldent care less how he looks (have he ever been on the squad before this movie?) even the joker which i find very out of character based on the looks of him seems to be kind cool because of jareds acting."
CmRih_VtVAs,stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,ew cara delisandwich is such an over rated actress why did you have to mess it up with her
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know what age rating it will be in the uk
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't speak for the movies themselves but so far Suicide Squad trailers have been destroying batman v superman trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh so many great movies! Yay 2016 !
CmRih_VtVAs,I am very aroused!
CmRih_VtVAs,Goodbye Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney will kill it as Cap Boomerang. :p
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a waste of $14.99 ticket movie! 🎬
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does Harley Quinn not have her accent 😟
CmRih_VtVAs,Now THAT is how you sell a movie !
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have to admit also, I'm more hyped for this since BVS spoiled a good chunk of their movie with the doomsday trailer. i just wish harlequin had her original voice from the batman animated series."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. you really should know this.
CmRih_VtVAs,YASSS
CmRih_VtVAs,"We are bad guys, this is what we do!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Kreygasm
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad, Civil War, Doctor Strange and Deadpool > BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The worst movie in DC history !!! WTF ....Harley quinn looks like avril lavigne!! Killer croc is Ben grim twin !!! And  the Joker ,the joker ....OMG ,OMG  its a Bad david Bowie tribute !!!! Looks like a Awful ,Awful cosplay  !!! I am  a HUGE FAN of DC ....But this is disrespectful"
CmRih_VtVAs,This just looks freakishly good :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great song.  Not too sure why you used it for this trailer, but yeah."
CmRih_VtVAs,10 times better than batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so good. The only thing I would have liked to see is harley Quinn's accent
CmRih_VtVAs,why is that all the awesome movies are releasing this year
CmRih_VtVAs,i gotta say at first i was like meh...but now im actually excited it looks really  good
CmRih_VtVAs,This film is gonna be good as Watchman (2009) damn.
CmRih_VtVAs,Beautiful. Just Beautiful BVS you guys suck after watching this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"P.s. 

Jared Leto nailed the Joker. 🃏"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is gourgeous!
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS FILM LOOKS AWESOME!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen-Bohemian Rhapsody...
CmRih_VtVAs,The best trailer that i ever seen 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,better than civil war trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"For those defending the BvS trailer not being spoiled, yes, it didnt spoil anything in my opinion. But little do you dumbasses know they'll still fuck Doomsday over no matter what. Think about it. They killed of Zod soo they could make Doomsday with his DNA & all that shit. BvS is gonna be a good movie but Doomsday will probably get killed off like he wasnt all the hype we got from seeing him the 1st time on the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Shut up and take my money!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is Carl Weathers in a mask and how are they going to get him past the Nazi guards?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is possibly one of the worse trailers I have ever seen. The song while an absolute classic, just doesn't fit with the footage and feels like somebody is playing their music while watching the trailer rather than being professionally constructed. To me, it seems as though they are trying to steal that GotG trailer magic. The footage on display actually looks amazing, but the trailer editing and song choice is baffling."
CmRih_VtVAs,"BvS will be better/more epic
Suicide Squad will be more fun!

that's my prediction."
CmRih_VtVAs,The woman who voiced Harley in Arkham Knight would've been PERFECT for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,YASSSS I CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, looking freakin' awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the work of the best video editor of all time. Give this man an Oscar right now.
CmRih_VtVAs,This kinda crap makes me appreciate C.Nolan even more for showing us that not every superhero movie has to be stupid meaningless empty action movie
CmRih_VtVAs,No one has ever missed the point of the Joker worse than Jared Leto.
CmRih_VtVAs,"hmm it doesn't reveal the entire movie, damn, wanted to save myself from buying a ticket."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm having the hardest boner of anticipation right now!! yay yay yay
CmRih_VtVAs,who/what is the thing at 1:44?
CmRih_VtVAs,Yawn...Looks terrible. Next.
CmRih_VtVAs,suck it Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,You had me at Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"OmigurdDDDDDD.
FFGIFIDN EJAKSIXJEEISHXJX"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 is Awesome... and HArley at 1:39 is bad shit crazy..
CmRih_VtVAs,The 1:36 point...I just find that to be funny.
CmRih_VtVAs,Beautiful !
CmRih_VtVAs,can't take tattoo and grills seriously
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer makes Deadpool looks boring that how insane it is. I can't wait for the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Delete the joker from this movie and I'm good.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like it!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lame, marvel fucks DC right in its pussy."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC Wins
CmRih_VtVAs,So finally Will Smith is playing a bad guy....kinda
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why Will Smith look like The Game in this?
lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can we stop with superhero movies please.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like it'll be the best movie of the year. The trailers are too good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok...this looks great.  Excellent editing.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg this is gonna be epic!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like it's going to be a crazy and awesome movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why this is not DARK!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,one of the most perfect song choices for a trailer...EVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is Harley like super slut?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody?Really?
CmRih_VtVAs,this is just beatiful
CmRih_VtVAs,why cant DC make a decent trailer...wtf?
CmRih_VtVAs,oh Margot...😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Which one will be better? Suicide Squad or Deadpool?
CmRih_VtVAs,Shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"gotta love Queen and BoRhap, and combine it with DC and what do ya know?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,하아아아아아아아아아악 I CANT WAIT ㅠ0ㅠ
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie gonna be so cuteeee
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad > Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this is excited.... Last trailer made it look like will smith was the focus character of the movie...
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 the best moment , pallaringas si"
CmRih_VtVAs,Already in love with Margot Robbie...
CmRih_VtVAs,this is one of the best trailer ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,"This isn't even BvS but stupid people still complaining about the movie being reveled in the trailer.. ya the entire 2hour+ movie was ruined for sure, ya no one knew that Batman and Superman were going to team up with Wonder Women, ya ALLLLL the characters were definitely reveled in the trailer and character development lol yall dumb"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wished killer croc would look better
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley looking a tad husky
CmRih_VtVAs,1:40 Worst. CG. EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn needed to be more playful and ditzy and yet weird, evil n crazy i wish she was more like the animated series Harley which is why we love her so much and is seems like Margaret Robbie cant really pull it off besides the sex appeal"
CmRih_VtVAs,"For anyone who didn't know, the song is Darude Sandstorm"
CmRih_VtVAs,More than 2600 downvotes?! THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will should of taken a L on this movie..... Guess Will tryna sink his career 3 times faster than Jada,  or his kids tryna sink his ship..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"heh, the leaked trailer was really good, made it look like it had good depth and darkness to it. this trailer? not so much."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, a non-serious DC movie. I have been waiting for this."
CmRih_VtVAs,A trailer that doesn't show the whole movie. got me interested. Looks pretty good.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What's that I should kill everyone and escape. Sorry it's the voices. I'm kidding that's not what they really said."" I laugh at that every time I've watched the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker again win the Best Actor to Oscars.
CmRih_VtVAs,Much better than what I was led to believe!
CmRih_VtVAs,let's do something FUN 😼
CmRih_VtVAs,Douchebag squad is more like it...
CmRih_VtVAs,NO I CANT HANDLE MY EXCITEMENT TILL AUGUST IM GONNA GO INSANE I SWEAR! BRING IT OUT NOW!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why choose the most annoying song ever made?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Eh...I can never picture the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air as a bad guy lol. 

I'll wait for a digital release."
CmRih_VtVAs,The Only video that I like in 2016 so far
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dude, Jared Leto straight up suuucks. This Joker looks so fucking stupid, I am very disappointed with how this version of the Joker will turn out, some wannabe thug flashy gang member bullshit. I don't care about the people that say ""you have to see the movie in order to make a decision, people complained about Heath Ledger when he was cast first and then loved him"" That's all bullshit, I saw the Dark Knight teaser when it first came out and all I heard was sound bites of Heath Ledger without seeing any footage and knew right then that he WAS the Joker. This shit, Leto's version is a fucking wannabe."
CmRih_VtVAs,idk man.. this songs great but it doesnt match the trailer in my opinion. nevertheless im excited to see the movie :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"The shirt says ""if you want peace, prepare for war"""
CmRih_VtVAs,still looks pretty awesome...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley's two lines here seem sooooo cheesy to me, and how they're delivred doesn't help much. Apart from that I'm pretty hyped and getting curious about Leto's Joker. But those two lines... they make me fear rest of the dialogue throughout the whole movie is gonna be this way.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney playing as himself; a drunk Aussie
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Batman v Superman sucks, this could be the savior for DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is fucking awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Look at the likes and dislikes compared to Dawn Of Justice. Its obvious which movie looks better. Props for not showing Batman too. Completely forgot he was gonna be in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,That beer crack though
CmRih_VtVAs,SO much more excited for this movie than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 train scene who is that
CmRih_VtVAs,Nobody bitched about marvel showing Ultron after a few trailers. And I think I'll enjoy BvS more. This does look good though
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like the way the joker looks in this BUT THE GOT HARLEY PERFECTLY
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley's accent isn't there :(
CmRih_VtVAs,Nothing special.
CmRih_VtVAs,I've never wanted to nail Anne Hathaway more
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS SO FUCKING CRAZYY!! I AM GONNA WATCH THIS FOR SURE!!
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:43 is that The Human Block from flash
CmRih_VtVAs,"im more excited for this than batman v superman and cap combined. will smith, harley quinn, and the joker. take my money"
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto is amazing as the joker and will smith is the real surprise in the movie.. i did think he would that convincing as an anti hero/villain
CmRih_VtVAs,So Will Smith gave up the opportunity to star in the next Independence Day movie to play in this crap. And Spike Lee wonders why no blacks are on the Oscar list this year.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, what? Are they like some kind of Suicide Squad?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I will be upset if that thing at 1:44 is the joker for some reason.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I fear it could be too aimed at younger audiences, as it's a 12. but I look forward to it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks awesome, I'm soooo going to watch this in the cinema!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"that ""woow"" from Harley at 1:10.. she owns me!! luuuv her!!! this is DC's year... hands down #KneelBeforeDC"
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 , самый лучший момент из всего трейлера ..."
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg why the fuck they had to use queen?! now ill have to spend my night listening to them.... i had things to do you know Y_Y
CmRih_VtVAs,"The music is terrible
Couldn't they just use something more appropriate for an Action Movier?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Legendary trailer, legendary song"
CmRih_VtVAs,... ok .. :v
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who's thinking: cool vintage music + superhero's action = poor imitation of ""Guardian of the Galaxy""?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Guardians"" had Hooked on a Feeling, we have Bohemian Rhapsody.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool thing...never knew deadshot is a black dude.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg wana whach
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,BASURA
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, now that was a cool trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Loved the Trailer. Harley seems a little annoying.. I think that's the because they showed so much of her dialogue in the movie in this trailer. I hope.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, this movie is about Isis and all those ""cool"" guys the US government fund to kill ""bad guys""?"
CmRih_VtVAs,just amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,That was fucking beautiful.
CmRih_VtVAs,Марго секси
CmRih_VtVAs,Who the fuck ever thought Boomerang could be one of my favorite characters in a movie trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,"+*Jack Daniel* haha the method really does work absolutely fine, tested it just now and made over *$300* extra so far today
I mean simply go watch this tutorial video again: y2u.be/BYSMfSK9YCU

before he makes it private only *LOL*"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome!!! Can't wait to see it soon!!! 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is a shitty choice for Deadshot. Also Deadshot sucks ass where the hell is Deathstroke!
CmRih_VtVAs,very funny
CmRih_VtVAs,no homo but man clint eastwoods son is one  good looking dude
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone know who the villain is?
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh Yeah!
CmRih_VtVAs,The music!!!That sync!!!The action!!!Margot!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,gofundme.com/3ekc2vw4
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Actaul trailer starts at 1:05 , mann that music helped a lot.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Great
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear that guy looks like Tom Hardy
CmRih_VtVAs,Could they have casted a better Harley Quinn or what? Blows my mind how perfect she is for it
CmRih_VtVAs,Stop it at 2:07 and woooaaaaa!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,damn!!! that was!!!! damn!
CmRih_VtVAs,not better than deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,"How come there are 2,619 dislikes if there are only 13 chainsaws in my asshole?"
CmRih_VtVAs,#SuicideSquadHype
CmRih_VtVAs,is that the eastwood kid?
CmRih_VtVAs,Hype has increased ten fold. BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY AND FRICKIN SUICIDE SQUAD COMBINED!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear Jared Letto is gonna be the worst joker ever
CmRih_VtVAs,shit!!  this is too awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this over and over and over its on an endless loop!
CmRih_VtVAs,"K, sorry people.
I actually didn't really like it :P
It kinda bored me, guess I'm not really a DC guy. Then again, I've never read any comics in my life xD
I like what they tried to do with Bohemian Rhapsody but, to me, they failed at it."
CmRih_VtVAs,MA LA TRAMA ?
CmRih_VtVAs,This has more color than Batman v SUPERMAN lol
CmRih_VtVAs,lol I loved Captain Boomerang's sneaky sip lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,margot Robbie looks hot
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this is a goddamn trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,epic
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's the black goop, in the building?  Venom? (I know Venom is marvel just kidding)"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC just copying Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone who says BVS will be a better movie than Suicide Squad, needs to get their eyes skewed."
CmRih_VtVAs,a perfect song for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys...
CmRih_VtVAs,Я хочу Марго Робби
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVER!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst trailer ever! All I know about this movie is that one of the government branches hires the worst criminals to fight against something. I don't know what they're fighting against, I don't know any other conflicts in the movie, no hints at any twists in the plot of the story, just jump shots of destruction and some one liners. YAWN!"
CmRih_VtVAs,как название переводится?
CmRih_VtVAs,this going to be the best superhero movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything was looking good until the joker showed up
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait who's the villain?
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie best in the movie and best person ever to meet in person she is  truly the best out there today .Go get em Robbie. BEST BEST BEST
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the type of bullshit that sells and hollywood is more than happy to oblige
CmRih_VtVAs,"the first one was so dark, this one is so comical"
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad Will Smith is in it...
CmRih_VtVAs,And I can't wait to see your toys....!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how before ledger nobody gave a hoot about the joker. Now the bandwagon sets in and they have heath ledgers joker up the ass lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beeelzebub has a devil put aside for meeee, FOOOR MEEEEE, FOOORR MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAARRRRRGGGHGHH"
CmRih_VtVAs,So....who's the villain? 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,This song is trying to remind us how old we are :( .
CmRih_VtVAs,where is batman
CmRih_VtVAs,crap... crap... crap... crap... I need pictures of the Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the only suicide squad trailer/footage/screenshot/ANY FORM OF MEDIA COVERAGE AT ALL that gives me ANY form of hype...
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the tentacle dude who roughs up the subway train?
CmRih_VtVAs,who or what is the main villain the squad is going after in this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS IM GONNA CRY
CmRih_VtVAs,looks pretty good
CmRih_VtVAs,"even with all my skepticism it's hard for me not to wan't to see the movie, theres such so much going on that I find it hard to not want to see it just because it's the first Harely quinn in a movie and a new joker. it's such a risk that it makes me anticipate it more then a lot of other comic book movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,And then all of a sudden kids appreciate Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i love Freddie Mercury, i love DC, I LOVE THIS TRAILER"
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol I love the people who aren't even willing to give it a chance lol I mean coooooome on that looks pretty badass so far! Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why, but 1:35-138 is the highlight of the trailer for me lol :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,so the black guy is good with guns
CmRih_VtVAs,If the joker wasn't in this movie it wouldn't have as much hype
CmRih_VtVAs,what the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie doesn't look good at all...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Glad to se Joel Kinnaman, great actor :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Gosh i cant wait for the movie to come out 😍😍😍  I have been waited since forever
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait so is Joker gonna be apart of the squad in this movie or are they supposed to go kill him or capture him?
CmRih_VtVAs,Already love Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Я считаю Джаред Лето будет ничуть ни хуже джокера из нолоновской трилогии. Фильм жду с нетерпением!  😀😊😀
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like Harley Quinn lol js
CmRih_VtVAs,01:58 Ace Chemicals?
CmRih_VtVAs,I was a touch weary before.. .but now... now you have my full attention movie...

CmRih_VtVAs,Flawless best thing I've beer seen in my life!!!!! I can wait! The joker tho. He's going to be the best of the best!

CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect trailer! No spoilers and still kicks ass!
CmRih_VtVAs,go please is fnaf films ))
CmRih_VtVAs,Yawn
CmRih_VtVAs,I replayed the shit out of 2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry, just killed my reply button. I can't help...."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a well made trailer.  Just hope it holds up throughout the film.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer was great, this one is ok too. I just can't ignore that Margo Robbie reeks of ""trying too hard"" in this trailer..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Выглядит весьма  интересно.
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,I need this now please
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:05 - ""Haha.  Bohemian Rhapsody?  In my movie trailers?  In 2016?  Is this memes?""

2:13 - ""...Okay.  Definitely not memes.  Holy shit.  This looks awesome."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Gotta admit! it was better than the batman vs superman trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait, so hyped for this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank you for 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm excited for Harley Quinn, I think Margot Robbie does a fantastic job of playing her."
CmRih_VtVAs,I kinda do and don't want to see this movie like for real
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto will be the best Joker ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,That's the song to beat!
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit this could actually be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot's acting is pretty shitty and she is going to fuck up Harley Quinn, but hopefully they don't give her too much fact time."
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song called?
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah great we gotta wait for August 😑😢
CmRih_VtVAs,Hate the song!
CmRih_VtVAs,"@Mozz Jones Do you even know who the director of this movie is?? The guy who directed Fury, End of Watch, even wrote the script for Training Day. There is no way this movie could turn up to be terrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,только бы фильм был хорош
CmRih_VtVAs,сооl
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard this movie was going to be rated J ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok yes this trailer is too awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:29 On closer inspection those are piano keys laid out one by one circling the knives, up top right is a dismantled piano, bottom right corner is a bunch of mousetraps, there are are a range of small plastic bags to the right side that could be drugs, perhaps explosives, to the left guns, roses and unopened champagne bottles, to the the top right wine glasses and more roses, top left you can just aboutmake out a ladies platform stiletto boot in black... he sure comes across like a fool in love, not sure what to make of that... :/

EDIT: Are those condoms just below the champagne bottles to the left??? That... is just a bit much..."
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool and this are my #1
CmRih_VtVAs,is tht crazy girl harley quin and is the green hair dude joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,joker
CmRih_VtVAs,one of the best trailers I seen on my life
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST!?!? OH NOOO
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beach Boys, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry, i was really tried to enjoy, but no, this is really bad. Effects are bad, actors are bad and i hate Jared Leto."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this movie man
CmRih_VtVAs,"damn ..... I was so busy listening to the song, I forgot to see the trailer XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad man gotta get the largest popcorn ever for that hell yeah!
CmRih_VtVAs,shes kinda pulling off emilie autumn's look
CmRih_VtVAs,I really don't think that this movie will be good. DC has failed this planet's movie theaters in 2016.
CmRih_VtVAs,wat the name of the song towards the end
CmRih_VtVAs,подпишитесь
CmRih_VtVAs,"All those Hero movies are starting to bore me... but this trailer was AWESOME!!!!!!!!

P.S.: AWESOMEEE!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This song hits hard
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen can sell just about anything for me. This trailer looked fucking awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who else got crush on Margot Robbie? I mean like, jeez"
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is so amazing, it is impossible not to get hyped now"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I only came for Margot Robbie! Then I came for Margot Robbie!

2:05"
CmRih_VtVAs,Before you ask about the song its Darude - Sandstorm
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why cut open the body bag that has a zip? Question 2: If shit has hit the fan this badly why aren't Superman, Batman or both trying to help too? I know Batman makes a cameo but still... as much as I can't wait to see this film, certain things just don't add up to me. I mean if their really is some giant monster surely Superman would be aware too?"
CmRih_VtVAs,please let deathstroke make an appearance.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody goes with everything
CmRih_VtVAs,completely different tone from the last trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how people are now saying that they judged jared leto too soon
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it possible Jai Courtnry may turn in a... Decent performance?..
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking forward to Deadpool n this only.... hope they don't fuck it up
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone else  think that the crashed aircraft at 1:06 could be batmans new bat-plane/jet
CmRih_VtVAs,"pleeeeeease don't fail us, Warner Bros."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sooo glad they chose Bohemian Rhapsody to this movie, now I'm even more excited to watch it! 
Awesome trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,What the fuck is the horrible Enchantress CGI?
CmRih_VtVAs,I am beginning to love Jared Leto as the joker but I still hate the design.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst version of the Joker ever seen, jesus christ. At least we know that isn't the real joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN NOT WAIT TILL THIS MOVIE COMES OUT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 Intentional BOOTY
CmRih_VtVAs,i think Jared Leto has potential to fill Heath Ledgers shoes. He will rock it!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley makes my pants fit funny.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't think the movie will be great, but this trailer definitely is."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love you Harley Quinn <3
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see this so bad
CmRih_VtVAs,"OKAY, OKAY. the first few moments overwhelm me with horny excitement. Granted that could be the expert trailer editors hitting me with the nostalgic bohemian rhapsody  everyone use to sing in the car together since 1975. Will Smith might be miscasted as deadshot BUT that being said, wills serious heartfelt style of acting now a days is nothing like it was back when he was goofy, its a much needed break from literally the 5 other main characters who are playing as insane.  some of harleys jokes are spot on and some fell flat, so I'm worried about the dialogue ruining the movie, but the action is definitely going to be epic.  oh and i still love letos shtick so far"
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one that thinks was i going mad while watching it?
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my(its a PG movie) toys
CmRih_VtVAs,"Amazing , this joker is really crazy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"dc is on its way to create the ULTIMATE comic book universe we've all been waiting for. dark, twisted and filled with god like characters and nutcases. this is drugs to me. the perfect recipe!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer since The Force Awakens
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody else get hooked the moment Bohemian Rhapsody started playing?
CmRih_VtVAs,Talk about a complete change of tone from the first trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Didn't that blonde girl used to be in Neighbours? Oh yeah Donna Freedman!

Now putting on an American accent acting like a bad girl... OH that's weird lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,holy fucking shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Anything is better with Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody, I love it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah yeah.. Nice hype.. Whens the console game coming out so we can move on
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quin got no type of ass 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,2.07
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker will have like 70 diffrent oufits in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So we can assume that Will Smith will be nominated for the 89th Academy Awards, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:18 Discount Tom Hardy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joel Kinnaman = discount Tom Hardy
CmRih_VtVAs,epic
CmRih_VtVAs,this is a Joke right....what a fail....soon as you seen Will Smith you know this shit is going to suck....and that Joker what the fuck is that trash.... i seen better Jokers on Halloween night HA
CmRih_VtVAs,"The editing to this trailer is bloody brilliant! Great song, can't wait until this comes out!😁"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Movie violence and the representation of reckless murder, has no affect on a person's behavior""...Spends millions on 2 minute commercials to AFFECT A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR and send them running to the Box Office..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"slc veeeeeeei 
agosto chega loooogooooooo
 💓💓😍😍😍😍😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,>waiting for a feminist to complain about that guy punching a chick in the face
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't comment on videos , but I am just so damn happy idc what anyone says"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie...awww hott as hell
CmRih_VtVAs,_BoomVideo_        instagram
CmRih_VtVAs,Hmm...Maybe the joker won't be as bad as I thought.
CmRih_VtVAs,Not my proudest fap
CmRih_VtVAs,Stealing a purse... really?
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who finds Jai funny as Boomerang? I fuckin died at 1:36!! Who dafuq drinks a beer during a battle lmfao!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,THAT LOOKS FUCKING GOOD
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer gave me trills
CmRih_VtVAs,ya la espero con ancias
CmRih_VtVAs,I would steal the bag too it's nice tho :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"el diablo and katana are the ones that seem more interesting, yet get the least amount of attention."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Another great Trailer! Top marketing as usual.

But probably another average film or terrible at worst."
CmRih_VtVAs,am i crazy (probably) but in part of that trailer did it look like the joker was saving harley or somthing???
CmRih_VtVAs,The audacity of a trailer to start with a queen song is astounding
CmRih_VtVAs,I... Don't like Harley in this trailer :/
CmRih_VtVAs,"so I was psyched for Margo Robbie cause I know she can do a harley type accent, but I didn't hear any."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto looks nothing like the joker, I think he is more of a joker fanboy rather than the real joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman is in the movie but they haven't shown him in the trailer. My guess is that he will have screen time but not a lot. There were leaked images of Ben Affleck dressed as Batman in set of the Suicide Squad going up against The Joker when he's driving.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Must they use these cherished songs, this track was made for fine films, like Wayne's World."
CmRih_VtVAs,Subscribe for my channel please
CmRih_VtVAs,"Never in my life have I seen a trailer, and been absolutely blown away as if I just watched an amazing movie. I need to see this movie. #BohemianSUICIDE"
CmRih_VtVAs,I... LOVE IT!
CmRih_VtVAs,I knew this was going to be good as soon as I heard Bohemian Rhapsody xD
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is just as bad as the previous one. And Leto still sucks.
CmRih_VtVAs,second song name please????????
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how the trailer isnt telling what is the movie going to be about . I love that keep it that way pls and Im super hyped all these buthurrt marvel fans are bashing on this one because they know its a real threat . Oh fck yeah , you're goddamn right it is."
CmRih_VtVAs,why is there a ghostrider villan shooting a machine gun @ 1:23 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited c:
CmRih_VtVAs,His actually looks good :D
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody :3 ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,Whos the Chick at 1:31 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks bad. Margo Robbie is a bad actress.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 EPIC!
CmRih_VtVAs,Ever since teaser I have been hyped when a t age rating
CmRih_VtVAs,"If there was nomination for the best trailer, I definitely know which one would be the winner"
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel we have a problem.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared, I'm sorry I ever doubted you, buddy.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I guess Joker is the villain, since he is in none of the scenes in the prison or the army camp."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I had high hopes for this film...




Now they're even higher"
CmRih_VtVAs,Trying too hard much?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:03 Those aren't people around that Explosion
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 harley quinn booty ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,I BELIEVE IN DCEU.I BELIEVE IN DC/WB TO SHINE IN 2016.I BELIEVE IN BATMAN V SUPERMAN!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn everybody? Harley Quinn? Yeah.... Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,"What i see here, is that they're going to be in a really big problem, this is definitely the beginning of something."
CmRih_VtVAs,holy crap that was fantastic...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm excited for the movie, but I hope it's not just filled with all of these gimmicks they've showed us in the trailer. The cheap attempts at a laugh."
CmRih_VtVAs,No Batman. Boo..
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,worst trailer ever went from going to see this movie to I'll wait for it on Netflix and probably after it gets on Netflix I'll watch old episodes of the flash instead.
CmRih_VtVAs,i thought of the series Arrwo  when i read the title suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn voice  needs more of New York accent
CmRih_VtVAs,TFW Margot Robbie bends over
CmRih_VtVAs,Any clue to who that is at 1:44 with the train? Doesnt really look like Enchantress. And from what I heard the real villain is yet to be revealed
CmRih_VtVAs,But who's the antagonist in this movie!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Tatooed Man @ 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,Representing Arkham Asylum East Gotham
CmRih_VtVAs,LMAOl at Harley reading what appears to be Twilight.
CmRih_VtVAs,love the spot where the music syncs with the machine guns 1:04

CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs up if you're tired of Batman and Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi boys
CmRih_VtVAs,it's funny how people are calling this cheesy and corny but if you find this corny then how cheesy do you think the marvel films have been?
CmRih_VtVAs,"harley quinn and the soundtrack is played by Queen,  (Quinn & Queen, sound similar) coincidence? I don't think so. ILLUMINATI"
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,watch them spoil the movie on the next trailer like they they did with BVS
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey, I know that song! And I like all those rapid cut scenes! Think I'll go see this movie when it comes out!

Way to play my mind perfectly Hollywood!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasn't that hyped for this film before but now...... I NEED TO SEE THIS FUCKING THING RIGHT NOW!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,People complaining about the ACCENT! WHAT THE FUCK???
CmRih_VtVAs,oh hell.............. most epic trailer......
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it me or the actor playing Boomerang looks a lot like Tom Hardy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker, that Harley Quinn line, and Bohemian Rhapsody make this trailer corny. I hope the movie isn't like this"
CmRih_VtVAs,regular dc comics shit u little 9gag victims will love
CmRih_VtVAs,Yus I agree ^-^
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide squad > Deadpool
Don't hate me."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freakin awesome can't wait for august to get here.
CmRih_VtVAs,I am relieved to know they have superpowers in this movie instead of being too realistic like the Nolan Trilogy.
CmRih_VtVAs,So racist
CmRih_VtVAs,And the Oscar winner for Best trailer ever goes to...... ;-)
CmRih_VtVAs,Song? Darude - Sandstorm
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!!Fuuck
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope the movie is as good as the trailer...or better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like this interesting change between the two trailers, from dark to upbeat.
Just hope it doesn't disappoint"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now, this is how all movie trailers should LOOK LIKE!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 Poison Ivy???
CmRih_VtVAs,What trailer could really look bad with Queen as soundtrack?
CmRih_VtVAs,Огонь! Жду фильма!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't stop watching this.
CmRih_VtVAs,killer croc is 11 foot tall... but ok. im sure that will never play a part in the movie -_-
CmRih_VtVAs,hmmmmm
CmRih_VtVAs,"KNEEL BEFORE DC,MARVEL!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"really, no one? ok... 
 Is this the real life?"
CmRih_VtVAs,a 2438 batmans no les gusto esto
CmRih_VtVAs,Yehy!!!  I Love Queen :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really dont like the Way Harley acts right now, but I have to see the Movie first to make a full Opinion. Also it might has to do with the Fact that im not a huge Fan of New 52 Harley, which obv. is the thing they were going for here. But overall this looks really good."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie........ won't be so bad to see.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer did what I didn't think was possible. It made me look forward to this movie. Good job, trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"the only part that worries me is will Smith. I dont want to see Will smith play Will smith, I want to see deadshot. And I'm not convinced he can play a villian, my guess is he's a villian who's really a good guy whos had some circumstances that forced him to be a bad guy. I hope I'm wrong and look forward to being surprised by him."
CmRih_VtVAs,Mierda! me erizó la piel <3
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking love me some queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Me after watching the video: 

Ohh Bohemian Rhapsody I love it!!

by the way, what was this trailer about?"
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking love me some queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"awsome trailer, queen always goes good with action. looks like a sick film, cant wait to see it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"First I'll say this trailer is great. However, using Queen in a trailer makes anything look great. There is not a single trailer ever made that would not look great with a Queen song over it. Even Pixels looked good at first, thats the power of Queen. I also hope the film has the fun tone that the trailer gives off because if you pay attention to alot of the scenes used in the montage it all looks very serious and if you took Queen out it makes it seem alot darker (except the Harley stuff). Anyway, that my brain on overdrive over-analysing everything, switching it back to HYPE setting now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"at 0:44 and so on he talks about all the bad guys and you can see that Enchantress before she becomes a witch, it comes to the scene with Enchantress and then Rick says:""And your posessed by a witch"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Trying to beat the deadpool movie.....when will they finally realize that marvel is better
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've never read a comic book so I don't know shit about this but... Why does everyone have to be so critical about EVERYTHING? None of you cunts have seen it, so cheer the fuck up."
CmRih_VtVAs,"GOD DAMN, THIS IS AWESOMEE 😍😍😍😍😍

AND QUEEN'SONG, DAMN IT 😍😍😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh shit this actually looks fun, good job DC."
CmRih_VtVAs,How did Cara get a role in this cast? At the time of filming she'd barely launched her acting career... She just seems out of place in a line-up with so many blockbuster stars
CmRih_VtVAs,captain boomerang won this trailer and i dont rate jai but the guy looks like hes perfect for the role
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks really great.  Not happy with the Joker as far as my ideal but seems to work within the framework of the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Darute Sandstorm
CmRih_VtVAs,"Although a lot less of the Joker, the teaser trailer was WAY better."
CmRih_VtVAs,GOOOOODDDD VERY GOOOOOD HARLEY QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,OH! YEHA 😆😆😆
CmRih_VtVAs,worst joker ever...
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't like the part from 2:32 and on .
CmRih_VtVAs,Nobody can ever replace Heath Ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,way more excited for this than fapman vs pooperman. It really looks like a much needed breath of fresh air!
CmRih_VtVAs,the new joker dont look to bad
CmRih_VtVAs,SIde Note:  Why all the hate for a movie trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Its nice that they're actually embracing the fact that the characters they're making these movies about are fucking ridiculous, and it would be even more ridiculous to try and make these movies gritty and serious. 

Sounds like that ""no jokes"" thing they talked about was utter telephone bollocks.

I just hope that the actual film is just as silly and doesn't take itself seriously, and they haven't just put *all* of the funny moments in the trailer just to compete with deadpool."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hype is real
CmRih_VtVAs,"I haven't seen any info on this movie ie how there going to be portraying the characters, but is this going to be some pre joker harlequin(soz if can't spell her name) and then meets up with him and becomes harlequin bcos if not just saying some crazy sounding lines don't make her crazy she needs the attitude she normally does and from these small clips she seams fake and acted. I love crazy woman I love harlequins character but I don't love this harlequin"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer looks like it's kinda' coverin' up a lot of bullshit about the film, but, I must reserve judgement for the film; not a two minute trailer that is put up against a song that naturally makes anything look like peanut butter and jelly -- still, it looky' kinda salty to me."
CmRih_VtVAs,love queen excellent music selection
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is Queen Bohemian Rhapsody if anyone is looking for it
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen ;(
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN! YES!
CmRih_VtVAs,This has a very 'Guardians of the Galaxy' Vibe im so pumped for this movie. I hope its as good as the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN IS BAE
CmRih_VtVAs,Orgasm O.O
CmRih_VtVAs,i had a feeling the biggest twist of this movie is batsy going up against joker at the end
CmRih_VtVAs,CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,i wanna fuck Harley Quinn version crazy of Margot Robbie in so many ways
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a DC movie where its not so serious and more comedy. Haters will hate but this move looks dope.
CmRih_VtVAs,This year looks like it's going to be good for movies.
CmRih_VtVAs,I was just listening to the Queen and forgot to watch the suicide squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,The best song ever written!
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's with all the jewelry and piercings the villains have?!?! I'm alright with captain boomerang having one earing, but even JOKER!?!?! I thought it wasn't supposed to be about the money and the bling with him. Love the trailer tho"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly i thought the use of Bohemian Rhapsody to just be distracting. I just kind found it hard to really get into the trailer and pay attention to it. I guess i would say that the song is just TOO distinct, TOO recognizable and stands out too much. The music and the visuals just didn't mesh well to me."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who think Jai Courtney looks pretty good and funny as that crazy character. He might be really good in that role. Probably just me?
CmRih_VtVAs,This was actually the perfect song xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"what's the song?






LOL"
CmRih_VtVAs,"holy shit Jai Courtney seems awesome in this, whats going on in the world"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys!"" LMFAO!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Cmon civil war u had to do it
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy on meth! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"we're bad guys, that's what we do. (nailed it)"
CmRih_VtVAs,yaaay that didnt kill it for me like the batman v superman trailer did.
CmRih_VtVAs,pinche pelicula horible
CmRih_VtVAs,The other trailer is more of a serious one and this is more of a fun trailer. I liked them both but this one kind of made me understand that it's not going to be the bad still being bad but trying to be good but failing at it. Like they are going to help be good for once. I like how they made all the credits colorful. It might be over hyped from the first trailer but this one can make it on an even playing field to make us enjoy it how it should be enjoyed.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Song name ?

I'M JUST KIDDING, RELAX"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith and Jared Leto are my favorite actors
CmRih_VtVAs,Please stop putting Will Smith in movies.....
CmRih_VtVAs,we bad guys that what we do is damn good line
CmRih_VtVAs,That laugh. Oh my goodness that laugh.
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought this was a TV show already
CmRih_VtVAs,it looks great I'm the type who loves the bad guys and more then just alittle crazy ha ha ha ha ha
CmRih_VtVAs,Slipknot's face portrayals my reaction to everything Harley in this trailer perfectly.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn trys too hard to be funny when shes fucking stupid as fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks fucked up
CmRih_VtVAs,Song is trash.
CmRih_VtVAs,ew.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If I want to watch a movie about the Suicide Squad, I'll be watching Batman: Assault on Arkham the only good movie about the Suicide Squad. This new movie just looks bad on every level."
CmRih_VtVAs,songs? ??
CmRih_VtVAs,Eat ass pin drop
CmRih_VtVAs,Well they definitely earned the pg-13 rating...
CmRih_VtVAs,smith as dead shot now im more disapointed
CmRih_VtVAs,GIVE ME THE SONG NAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREEEEEAT MUUUUUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Что за хрень , я только что посмотрел?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevigne's name? 🙅
CmRih_VtVAs,i love 1:52
CmRih_VtVAs,day 1: I have rewatched this shit over a 50 times
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 you're welcome!
CmRih_VtVAs,daaaaamn that ass... 2:06 must watch movie for sure lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Un pelin pretenciosa para ser una pelicula de antiheroes, no? xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi I want to know the beginning songs name plz ... Anyone knows? Thx
CmRih_VtVAs,cn someone tell me the song pls..?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker is literally the only thing interesting in this film. Looks and sounds the best and for the rest of the group, neh"
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone know who they fighting
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad we'll never get a batman and bellboy movie science they and Jack knight Starman were in a comic fighting the joker and nazis
CmRih_VtVAs,Going to b the greatest movie ever 😴😴
CmRih_VtVAs,"I got major Guardians of the Galaxy vibes tbh. I feel like they've kinda stolen Guardians thing a little bit. This looks SO CHEESY though. Those lines ""It's the voices"" and ""We're bad guys, it's what we do"" just did not land. They made me cringe, it was embarrassing. I'm still not feeling Jared's Leto or Robbie's Quinn at all buuuuut I actually think El Diablo looked more awesome that I had imagined and Katana could be cool if she gets enough screen time."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay... Okay,... I could work with this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The joker is interesting, it seems better than I expected"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I thought this movie was gonna be good, now it just looks like a bad comedy or something, had potential."
CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't anyone seem to like this trailer? I want to see it.
CmRih_VtVAs,yo creo que no es entendible esta pelicuka
CmRih_VtVAs,Why the hell am I watching this by the 3000000th time?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto's joker is going to be perfect for the tone of this movie. 
""But it's not like Heath's"" says every bitch ever.
Well no shit. People thought Heath's wasn't going to be as good as Jack Nicholson's. But with the change in overall theme and tone of a movie the characters change some as well."
CmRih_VtVAs,Loving Jared as the joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than the first teaser. *WAY* better than anything from BvS. Still not sure though.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer actually have me aside to see will smith and something new and not sad that he's so shitty
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the Joker going to be a part of the team or theyre nemess like in the animated movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,That music que where will smith is in his cell and they break in and they hit him it's just great makes this trailer great
CmRih_VtVAs,The name of the song is Darude Sandstorm.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm getting a strong Guardians of the Galaxy vibe from this...
CmRih_VtVAs,i love this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,This gave me chills. Awesome trailer haha
CmRih_VtVAs,GAVNO AMERICANSKOE!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Perfect choice of music.
10/10"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Do your research, people. The song is Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, put out in 1975 -- way before any metal bands did a remake."
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's that? You're telling me to kill everyone in the comments who doesn't know the song name and puts it's Darude Sandstorm?
...Sorry. It's the voices. 
I'm KIDDING. 
That's not what they said. ;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 my favorite moment from the trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,People will find anything to complain about these days. I for one am looking forward to this film. I especially like how there's two different trailers to really show the uniqueness of the characters. This'll be a lot of fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,*_*
CmRih_VtVAs,Groot should know he's too big to fit in the subway
CmRih_VtVAs,"damn, killer croc looks stupid... Whole CGI killer croc could have been better."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn and dead shot look terrible. Bad choices.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeesssssss this is what j have been waiting for
CmRih_VtVAs,can someone explain what this movie is about? It looks like it was made by a druggy...
CmRih_VtVAs,"2,454 Hydra agents"
CmRih_VtVAs,IT'S BEAUTIFUL !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my lord
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:00
♪ Can't do this to me baby, *JUST GOTTA GET OUT* , just gotta get right out of here

If you're going to use one of the best songs of all time, at least don't randomly cut it up."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This did not make me want to watch it, come on dc don't fuck up"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:34 the guy doing a Groot impression
CmRih_VtVAs,The music so didn't fit what the hell? I thought I loaded a fake trailer at first
CmRih_VtVAs,sounds like these dudes would be BFF with Deadpool...
CmRih_VtVAs,"How the hell do people not know who Queen is? Are there a million 7 year olds on this site or something? Even they should know.

And gotta love people that associate Quinn more with the exaggerated accent than the total psychosis."
CmRih_VtVAs,DAT ASS
CmRih_VtVAs,damn Margot Robbie is fuckin hot!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 GODDAMN!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is a pleasant surprise. People complaining about superhero movies and how their not comic booky enough. Well here you go bitches on a silver platter! #FUCKMARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want this joker to face that batman in a solo movie , make it quick DC"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks cool doesn't it. Our generation finally bringing DC to the big screen but did they do it right? It should be rated R to give you an idea. Bet it's PG-13 so they can sell to the masses & little kids thinking it's cool to be bad. 2016 has a lot of superhero movies coming out. We want to escape reality.
CmRih_VtVAs,I finished to this
CmRih_VtVAs,That looks amazing. Queen track don't hurt none either!
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx? Is it u? PogChamp
CmRih_VtVAs,movie logic. HQ sits in prison with perfectly dyed hair.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's this kind of film that highlights the historical lack of social and financial mobility for those less fortunate.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bay Marvel :'v
CmRih_VtVAs,It's pretty sad to see that song getting overused so much.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bay Marvel :'v
CmRih_VtVAs,So will smith is deadshot That's a thumbs up  :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"First impression: Joker looks mediocre, doesn't look like he'll turn out good. Harley Quinn looks pretty great, I'm optimistic about that.

Now: Joker looks amazing, really looking forward to that. However, it looks like they just f*cked Harley Quinn up the ass just to please the 13 years who are going to watch."
CmRih_VtVAs,"At 1:09, Harley's woah is literally my everything."
CmRih_VtVAs,The Hype is Real!
CmRih_VtVAs,@2:10 someone is going to plant a Bomb in COD4 :v
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm usually not the kinda dude who naysays casting choices before I'd seen the movie, but it's really hard for me to see Harley Quin without Arleen Sorkin's voice."
CmRih_VtVAs,@killem89 Shitty movie? Well that's your own shitty opinion.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
CmRih_VtVAs,"Actually, there's an ENORMOUS butspot right here 2:07. Brilliant."
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks 10 times better than BvS. (Also thank you for not showing the whole fucking movie in 2 minutes)
CmRih_VtVAs,"i don't know much about DC comics so sorry if this is a dumb question! 

but is this film connected to the new batman vs superman movie? 
is the joker in this (Jared leto) suppose to be the same as the joker in the batman trilogy? (Heath ledger)

if not, can someone explain please :p"
CmRih_VtVAs,the song choice literally made this trailer 10 millions times better
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker is looking good well the acting not the grill and tattoos
CmRih_VtVAs,That song sucked with that trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley in the end of the movie will be like ""So, we saved the city... and kill thousand of people in the process. Damn... we are just like superman!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG ya quiero verla
CmRih_VtVAs,Only the Joker looks interesting to me.
CmRih_VtVAs,wear your heart on your cheek? marina much?
CmRih_VtVAs,If someone answers to the question what song it is with darude sandstorm .. Don't :D For the sake of chocolate don't
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG OMG OMG OMG cant wait !!!!!! it sucks that its in august...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay fine, I'm interested now DC."
CmRih_VtVAs,♥
CmRih_VtVAs,Your parents' music is/was better than yours.
CmRih_VtVAs,not feeling jokers line. but the rest looked fair good tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,"why the hell does Rick Flagg sound like Jay Briscoe from Ring of Honor?

nonetheless, SHUT THE FUCK UP AND TAKE MY GODDAMN MONEY"
CmRih_VtVAs,So... we've taken the intro to Wayne's World and applied it to our trailer... John Carter treatment anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,FFFFFFFFUUUUUUCCCCKKKK
CmRih_VtVAs,i love that joker and for me the best actor will be obviously margot robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,What songs are included in this trailer sooooooooo wonderful??
CmRih_VtVAs,i love that joker and for me the best actor will be obviously margot robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like they turned this into a family movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Most people came to Bohemian Rhapsody because of this.
I came to this because of the music."
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 very good!
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope it's perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,"This seems like the trailer for 8 year olds, the first one had a little more suspense and mystery, this was kinda cringy and lame"
CmRih_VtVAs,ahhhhhhhhhh cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad >>>>>>>>> Civil war
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG.....I need to watch this,....the voices just told me that.......just kidding...they didnt saythat LLLOLOL"
CmRih_VtVAs,"@Diego Saenz Just only means you have a shitty taste in music and that in itself is the real comedy, clown."
CmRih_VtVAs,"BIG QUESTION...?????
Joker is really Jason Todd right..????


p.s- haven't played Arkham Knight just heard the rumors.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Unless this takes place years before Man of Steel, the concept of this movie taking place in the same universe doesn't make sense. Why would the government ask criminals help to stop... whatever it is they're stopping... when there is a kryptonian god living among them? But again, this probably does take place before Man of Steel.

Anyhoo, this trailer has me cautiously optimistic. I still don't think it'll be a great movie but at least it looks fun."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Go to 2:07, pause it, thank me later."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still not 100% convinced on Leto's Joker, but it looks alright overall. I'll probably see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Song name??
CmRih_VtVAs,"now thats how you make a  trailer! Damn, i wasn't that excited at first but.. wow"
CmRih_VtVAs,songs ??
CmRih_VtVAs,Music by Queen!  Flash!  AAAAA-UUUUUUUUU
CmRih_VtVAs,sooo good
CmRih_VtVAs,все сюда 2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so fucking cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was so excited for this but now I am a but disappointed, if this is a good film they didn't show it very well in this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,CANT WAIT!
CmRih_VtVAs,Da best trailer I ever seen 👌
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't find the word for it ! Im hooked !
CmRih_VtVAs,So what is this...a new Suicide Squad trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Warner Bros. If you make another trailer and ruin the movie I won't go see this...
This trailer is perfect with the music matching the action so leave it at that.
Queen? Really? *Starts a slow clap*"
CmRih_VtVAs,Esta buena la peli
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why does this have to be PG-13? 

Take notes from Fox, WB, and diversify your movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,good trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,I remember the  goods days when Freddie was here . Now he's bitting the dust
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever created this trailer is a marketing genius. I went from mildly interested in the film to pretty damn excited. Great job!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm pulling for you DC!! Cmon let this be good. This is your last chance. Well that's a lie but this could very well be your 4th to last chance.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah definitely won't be going out of my way to see this money grabbing piece of shit. Makes me think of a time when George Clooney was Batman. Not good times at all
CmRih_VtVAs,Why wasn't THIS the first trailer? This actually looks fun. The first one made the movie look like another somber borefest like Man of Steel and what BvS is shaping up to be. This one actually looks like something I'd sit in a theater to watch.
CmRih_VtVAs,"@Pipe It's one full song, just the hard rock segment. Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This's could be one of the best trailers I've seen since Star Wars, the music only helped it seem more awesome! Like seriously the inclusion of queen songs in trailers recently, we had gta v, the minions and now this!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know. Looked shitty to me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cadê os BR's Huehue ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Stop. Trying. To. Turn. This. Movie. Into. Guardians. Of the galaxy. It deserves better.
CmRih_VtVAs,August? THE FUK?
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,So exited! Yay! The worst heroes ever are here!
CmRih_VtVAs,"... i really want to see WHY all these characters are bad guys -- like they all better show them each massacring an orphanage or something. inconvenienced or misunderstood bad guys, who cares. actual bad guys? come on movie, sell me."
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like it's trying too hard to be guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,BADASS!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen ... are immortal and Freddie Mercury is the God of Music
CmRih_VtVAs,"what the fuck I just watched, I want my 2.5 minutes back"
CmRih_VtVAs,@mrbubbles720 everything don't always have to be so dark and gritty.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,But does anyone know the guy at 1:43
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Soo did they just copy & paste the guardians of the galaxy trailer? Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Whose the MaMa? Did he pulled the trigger??
CmRih_VtVAs,give whoever made this trailer an oscar
CmRih_VtVAs,ta tranquilo ta favoravel
CmRih_VtVAs,DC has been taking notes from marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,SQUAD
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't believe they used a Macklemore song for the movie. Definitely not watching it now. Stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awsome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow...! Wait, is that... ""Bohemian Rhapsody""? :D Sorry. Just love this song."
CmRih_VtVAs,Prevejo o Omelete comentando esse trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a nice song. I think the band will do alright :)
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that I'm excited by this and I want to watch it so badly just because the trailer had Bohemian Rhapsody says a lot about how easy to please I am.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait for this to come out!    =)
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so amazing please DC don't fuck this up
CmRih_VtVAs,"So Rick Flagg's love interest is Enchantress? @:45 ""you're possessed by a witch"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've already watched this trailer like 500 times. I think, I create a little obsession ."
CmRih_VtVAs,song ???
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for sluttier Harley Quinn this Halloween. BURGHandy Banana
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry I can't take this serious , in my option they fucked up watch and you will see . Sure it's maybe a good action  movie but not a dark DC batman villain movie besides the joker looks more like a punk thug in a suit not like a real criminal anyway let the fanboys cheer and enter the hype train . Oh and I bet in the end of this movie no matter how cool and strong they all are , they all will be brought back to jail by Batman haha"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't go out and see many DC movies...   But this is a must see for me.  I didn't even watch the latest Batmans, I won't watch Superman anymore...   Yeh, yeh, I know his backstory.  No need to go repeating it ad nauseam.  

But this movie, I gotta see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,did queen release a new bohemian rhapsody clip
CmRih_VtVAs,Actually loving a Jai Courtney performance for once👌👏👏
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg cara 🙆🏻0:45 🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fuck-a molly this is awesome and Bohemian Rhapsody...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Compared to the teaser trailer, I was shocked to see the ""fun"" vibe this movie has. ""I started a joke"" made the film look really intense and cool but using ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" now makes it look awesome so kudos to the marketing team!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie rules
CmRih_VtVAs,"i still don't like this new ""joker"", i think the best one will be Harley."
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I just orgasmed....
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you a 02:07 fan, good news guys! You can see this actress fully naked in The Wolf of Wall Street."
CmRih_VtVAs,In David Ayer we trust
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is Killer Croc so small is my question.
CmRih_VtVAs,i wish there was a movie with Ivy in
CmRih_VtVAs,That part at 2:07...NICE!
CmRih_VtVAs,those beat-matching gunshots.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks much better than Batman Vs Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker should interrupt a taping of Wayne's world!
CmRih_VtVAs,Edgy: the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,the sound of Punch  0:38  like super bass
CmRih_VtVAs,Marget Robbie 🙈
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let's be real here, all the people bashing on this trailer are Marvel fanboys, haters that were proved wrong and can't accept it, and there's the 1% who genuinely dislike it (dunno why though)

Because this trailer is really awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well I'm even more sold now, this movie looks awesome.  Putting in Bohemian Rhapsody was just perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bien. Q no cuenten nada todavía
CmRih_VtVAs,"These colors are so psychedelic, imagine watch the movie with LSD!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please please PLEASE take out that ""we're bad guys"" line!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,the witch has some bad CGI
CmRih_VtVAs,so fucking hype!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,PG-13?  That's a nope.
CmRih_VtVAs,A trailer not revealing what the movie is about?! Is this real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,And for those who don't know the song. It's by a man called Kanye west.
CmRih_VtVAs,Пидоры зачем сюда засунули святую песню
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith as Deadshot? I'm pretty surprised lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,Enough said this already looks like a masterpiece
CmRih_VtVAs,I kind of have a problem with Will Smith being deadshot he doesnt fit the part to me but I haven't seen the movie so who knows.
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit! Too epic! Must watch!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen?  Will smith?  What 's this,  the 70s? 
love it"
CmRih_VtVAs,That was good 😏
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 Jesus, look that shirt"
CmRih_VtVAs,"close to 2,400 people disliked this since they got assaulted by the Suicide Squad and didn't like it"
CmRih_VtVAs,God! I love when badass action is timed with music!
CmRih_VtVAs,The only DC movie I am planning to watch this year.
CmRih_VtVAs,"People who say this looks ""corny"", since when has a hero film not been corny? If it's not a man flying about with a cape on, it's some twat who turns big and green when he's cross."
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this is how you do a trailer!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Watching the comments i have found one of the most common FAQ:What song that was?
So anyidea what song that was?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"With all this hype it better live up to it....Come on, you're gonna use that band to promote your movie? Better be legendary or we are going to have a problem."
CmRih_VtVAs,Блондинка класс у меня встал
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow i think dis songs cool, do u know the name ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,People ask for DC to be more humorous but then when they are they hate it. Omg people please make up your mind. I personally love this trailer probably more than the first.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Only 2 things to bitch about. 1 don't like the joker all tatted up, but I think Leto's performance will make me overlook it. 2 that final scene with Harley was a bit on the nose, we get it they're bad guys no need to beat us over the head with it. Hope that scene isn't in the final movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason I might watch this is because Will Smith is in it. :D
CmRih_VtVAs,0:06 Sounds like angrygrandpa :D
CmRih_VtVAs,What a shitty fucking song. I'm sorry I had to say it. Seems like its just going to be a comedy movie now.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm getting an Escape From New York vibe off their mission. Everything seems deserted.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol, I don't know why but the funniest part of the trailer is the guy opening up the can and drinking while looking out for danger."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the green monster or person that destroys the train with his arms????
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO READY
CmRih_VtVAs,the awkward moment when you realise that Jai Courtney is one of the best things in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"After seeing all the comic book movie trailers for the year, I've reached a verdict:
The Marvel movie I'm looking forward to the most is Captain America 3, no hate to Deadpool which looks fantastic
The DC movie I'm looking forward to the most is definitely Suicide Squad, again no hate to BvS but it spoiled to much."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever (?)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 I don't know how should I feel with Joker wearing a Tuxedo
CmRih_VtVAs,Viola Davis character should have been killed the exact moment she uttered that stupid and negligent idea.
CmRih_VtVAs,BAHOMET GOT A TIME 4 ME 4 MEEEEE 4 MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGEEJHHRTH
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't wait to see this movie, but i gotta tell, this trailer looks a lot like guardians of the galaxy"
CmRih_VtVAs,No batman In this trailer?! Not even a glimpse?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who else got excited af, sung this song while the trailer was playing?🖐🏽"
CmRih_VtVAs,Add Queen to any trailer and it's going to be awesome :D Seriously though... what a fun trailer! Hope the movie is equally as fun and awesome. Too bad it comes out in August though... baby is due at the beginning so we won't be able to see it in theaters /sobs
CmRih_VtVAs,why am I not involved in this film
CmRih_VtVAs,This is amazing! Fuck the haters.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I fucking hate some of these comments that say the trailer is not ''dark and creepy'' enough , i hope this movie will not be too serious like the rest of the superhero movies we have seen the past year , i really liked the old spider man movies and guardian of the galaxy,  because these movies had a ''fun'' story mixed with the right amount of seriousness."
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so beautiful!
CmRih_VtVAs,THE MUSIC FUCKING SUCKS......THIS IS BAD VS EVIL......NOT A FUCKING PICNIC.
CmRih_VtVAs,she is just like harley
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 you are welcome :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the Queen music...PERFECT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Trailer feels so PERFECTLY CRAZY!
Totally pumped UP,This is the start  of DC phase and its fucking Awesome(Be careful marvel)!
If super villains team up is this cool,I just cant wait for the best superheroes team up Justice League."
CmRih_VtVAs,that how you do a trailer BVsS...
CmRih_VtVAs,So this is the film the lad bible have been cumming over for the last two years.....
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sure Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is gonna be fun but I was expecting a Harley Quinn like the Arkham Games
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is going to be a bad ass movie, but  they should have put a sexier girl  playing as Harley with big nice boobs and ass though..just saying..😉😄."
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,can we talk about 1:57... like does Harley die?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ugh.

Pretty obvious Will Smith was more devoted to how good he could look in the movie and not to the character he was playing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Does this remind anyone else of the Guardians trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,LIVE ACTION HARLEY FANSERVICE REJOICE
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is louder than the footage.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Awesome
I'm sold on Harley Quinn bar her last line.
Joker could still go either way though I'm sure I'll prefer it to Heath Ledger's (don't like his)."
CmRih_VtVAs,Adding Queen music to a shitty movie doesn't make it more like able
CmRih_VtVAs,can finally say I'm not excited for the new joker he looks like a Cracked Out Hipster.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think this Trailer is just perfect. The music by Queen, the look, the characters (Especially Margot Robbie). This trailer is just so different. I cant even explain it. It's really not the typical superhero movie. The first trailer was epic and this was extremely funny. I hope the movie just becomes as good as both trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,i know leto is going to be  the best joker till date
CmRih_VtVAs,Love how the top comments are people threatening the people whom are asking what song this is.....yet I haven't actually seen a comment that asked what song it was...
CmRih_VtVAs,Mi ez a szar?Szánalmas milyen silány filmeket akarnak ledugni az ember torkán.Ez aztán szinvonal.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I feel like (insert character ) could've been done better"" comments are the best, it's like they already saw the movie and know exactly what happens.... The movie isn't even out yet, how do you know they fucked up your character or not, come on wait till it's released to butch and moan about it..."
CmRih_VtVAs,neat
CmRih_VtVAs,yeahhhh 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,funny
CmRih_VtVAs,я
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will be fun!
CmRih_VtVAs,can't fuckin' wait
CmRih_VtVAs,that was just epic..now time to re-watch it over and over
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Out of all the superhero/comic book movies in 2016. This is the one i'm more excited about, it just looks amazing. The villains are always more fun to watch. Btw LOVE Margot as Harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,so who the hell are they fighting against?
CmRih_VtVAs,Esperaba algo más psicópata y tétrico...
CmRih_VtVAs,So sick of superhero movies.
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,how'd they get rights released to them for Bohemian ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't like the dude playing boomerang, he sounds annoying..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone knows who is the guy that the Joker slaps and says ""I can't wait to show you my toys""???"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 Looks like jokers puting harley into the joker  cemical bath (sorry i forget the name of it its just gone out of my head lol . Trailer looks awsome so does joker and harley!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks better than Batman V Superman....
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this a comedy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury would have made an excellent Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Eu invoco os BRS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was afraid that this Joker was going to shirtless, but this trailer put those fear to rest"
CmRih_VtVAs,it's gonna be siiiiiick
CmRih_VtVAs,I still hate that versuon of Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Eastwood needs to be in more movies man.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for Suicide Squad 2 lol
CmRih_VtVAs,That part with Joker on the floor sent chills down my spin. I have hope in Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is more like a trailer for a comedy film lol SUICIDE SQUAD HYPE!
CmRih_VtVAs,Thankfully they didn't use a cover and presented us with Freddie's voice!
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this? it's King right? Trolololo
CmRih_VtVAs,wow so edgy.../sarcasm
CmRih_VtVAs,why do they bother to put out trailers this far in advance? do they not know this is the age of ADD and the limited attention span of the internet?
CmRih_VtVAs,harley!!! quinn!!
CmRih_VtVAs,geniallll pero harley quinn su voz no se parece :(
CmRih_VtVAs,Очередная куйня из СШП.
CmRih_VtVAs,This just melted my face off............ don't know how i'm typing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Def finna see this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Goovle 'Kalergi plan' from 1920s please.  Read, believe, share widely.  Not a hoax, my/your European future.  Spread the wird"
CmRih_VtVAs,SPOILER! FREDDIE MERCURY IS THE VILLAIN :P <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"As Marvel and DC fan, I CANT WAIT FOR THE MOVIE. THANK YOU MARVEL AND THANK YOU DC FOR MAKING THESE AWESOME CHARACTERS AND THE MOVIES THAT WE FANS ALWAYS WANTED."
CmRih_VtVAs,I have to say the first trailer was shit. But this actually  looks decent.
CmRih_VtVAs,This film has the potential to be superb.
CmRih_VtVAs,wait did i just see some sort of roots or plants in the train scene? are they going against joker or evy?
CmRih_VtVAs,THAT WAS AWESOME!!
CmRih_VtVAs,woooooooooooooooooooooooooooou
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pause at 2:07 
You're welcome"
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok this one actually makes this movie look good
CmRih_VtVAs,DIsney Must be Shitting their Collective Pants.
CmRih_VtVAs,My fav band with my fav characters? I forgot how to breathe...
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Felt like there where spoilers in the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Coming from a huge Marvel fanboy, this trailer is great. I didn't have high hopes for this movie from the first trailer, but now I do. I think Jared Leto is going to do good as the Joker. I don't hate DC at all. Can't someone like both Marvel and DC?"
CmRih_VtVAs,that queen song made this trailer 10x better
CmRih_VtVAs,wat is sonng i am lisen 2?
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh Freddie...The feels.
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know you're in love when do you click on the replay and already leave the mouse over the button to see again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again."
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel's on Suicide Watch!
CmRih_VtVAs,The perfect cast and Will Smith.
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT TILL AUGUST UGH
CmRih_VtVAs,God dammit I hate Will Smith.
CmRih_VtVAs,Что за хуйня? Опять Гомиксы?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Omg! !! I completely freaked out when I heard Bohemian Rhapsody... but then it shouldn't come off as a surprise because it's the best song EVER and should be everywhere!! long live queen, long live Freddie, Brian, Roger and John ❤❤💋"
CmRih_VtVAs,to com expectativa alta para esse filme
CmRih_VtVAs,"my favourite song playing. .. hmmm, the film is definitely worth watching!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Это божественно
CmRih_VtVAs,"Crazy shit
Awesome shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,Pass
CmRih_VtVAs,of someone's wondering about the song it's darude - sandstorm oh you're  welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,What a buch of a-holes
CmRih_VtVAs,Harely quin sounds like that girl that wears all the lipstick
CmRih_VtVAs,if this is the feel of the entire movie then this may be the best superhero movie this year
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was expecting harley to be crazier,margot is too vanilla"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm throwing all my money on the screen right now, I don't know why nothing is happening.

Just take it, Dc!"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 The Milky Way ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,"слово недецкое в названии, в россии запретят показ"
CmRih_VtVAs,we need a trailer or a clip wish jokers laugh
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope it's darker than the trailer is portraying. It kind reminds of kickass it's trying to be funny while filling the rest with violence
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for this now than I am for batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"here's the first teaser setting up this dark environment and tone, and the second trailer is like, fuck that comedic and light tone all the way"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song and trailer fit SO perfectly!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:52, what is that walking?"
CmRih_VtVAs,what are the songs in the videos or intros
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw Alex Mercer arm !! 1:51
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks so much better than BvS it's unbelievable. I'm definitely watching this, if any DC movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I pray to fuck this is going to be rated r. No sense in making a villains movie without a bit of the old ultraviolence.
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg Bohemian Rhpasody I love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Excellent trailer - definitely makes me want to go and watch the movie. I thought David Ayers End of the Watch was a superb buddy cop movie, until they messed up the ending."
CmRih_VtVAs,"http://puu.sh/mCWe2/fb4ee7c36f.jpg

Grabbed at 1:44 , any suggestions on who it is?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn: we're bad guys, it's what we do! XD so can't wait for all the comic book movies to come out this year!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"lemme guess, bohemian rhapsody's video will be filled with suicide squad comments."
CmRih_VtVAs,Coolest trailer I have seen in a while!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great usage of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. Take notes, people."
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG.
A BLACK MAN
A CROCODILE MAN
A CRAZY BITCH
TWO WHITE MAN
AND A CHINESE

This hoppe this will be a film about Integration and love <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to suck...
CmRih_VtVAs,nothing really matters to me
CmRih_VtVAs,Loved the sly Die Antwoord Cameo in the shop display
CmRih_VtVAs,Here Jared Leto looks like crazier than a goat // Jared Leto luce estar mas loco que una cabra jajajajja. Nice Trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"you see marvel this is how you make a fucking awesome group of heroes,not youre corny shitty avengers team"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me wtf is happening at 1:39
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody fits perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,"GOOD GOD, THIS LOOKS AMAZING"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me wtf is happening at 1:39
CmRih_VtVAs,"в жопу дедпула, я лучше на этот фильм пойду"
CmRih_VtVAs,for some reason in this trailer harley reminds me of a disney princess who got banned from disney land
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is iron man??????????
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling the joker is going to take the minor part of the film
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody fits perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,"In the previewsly trailer Harley Quinn looked so creepy and awesome... but in this one, I don't feel she's crazy. Idk, it's like the acting isn't convincent at all. In the other hands, Jared Leto surprised me. He just killed it. This gonna be a great version of the Joker, even he could beat Ledger."
CmRih_VtVAs,2K marvel fans here
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy **@@*#*#*$**! So excited for this movie! One of my favorite trailers I've ever watched! The song sounded great for this trailer too!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love that song, Darude Sandstorm is Awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,"set design and costumes look so good, amd if the trailers are any indicator we might expect some nice things with music.. but all those quotes like ""ah, the voices"" and shit like that are so fucking silly lmao"
CmRih_VtVAs,please don't suck please don't suck please don't suck please don't please don't suck  please don't suck
CmRih_VtVAs,song?.... Darude - Sandstorm
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07
dat ass... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT I FEEL LIKE GOING SUPER SAYAIN
CmRih_VtVAs,We're bad guys it's what we do
CmRih_VtVAs,1:07 - 1:20 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,just perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"What is this the 10,000,000 time ive watched this trailer?"
CmRih_VtVAs,where is Batman ?!
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED THIS FILM IN MY LIFE LIKE LAST WEEK!!!! #suicidesquad
CmRih_VtVAs,Not THAT should have been the first trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,It's weird how the comic con trailer was all moody and shit but this one is funny
CmRih_VtVAs,"Deadpool, Batman Vs Superman and Now this?!!!! I am super pump up for this 3 movies!😃👍👍"
CmRih_VtVAs,"мне кажется, у меня что-то намокло."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be so good. Holy shit!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, now Harley behaves like Harley at least, I thought it was gonna be worse after the 1st trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"no , i didnt cry..... why you asking ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer has done something I never thought possible...it actually made me like Jai Courtney!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wanted more crazy, more psychotic"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:02 Just gonna get out; Just gonna get right out of here
CmRih_VtVAs,epic looks a2some2
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks shitty as hell, this might as well just stop trying to be good."
CmRih_VtVAs,song was perfect for this trailer. cant wait till August!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the BGM?
CmRih_VtVAs,"==================================
Пусть кто это читает будет счастливым
Кто подписаться будет молодцом
Кто лайкнут будет красавчиком)))
================================="
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel stills has the better production just because the programs and films link. I still like DC but i wish the companies would just get together and link everything. It would be much more successful
CmRih_VtVAs,wait sos Cara is the witch wow now I've seen it all
CmRih_VtVAs,what's it going to be rated
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like Im gonna have to see this 10x just like I did with Star Wars
CmRih_VtVAs,"My opinion.....
............. No."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm dying
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks awesome ! pls dont suck .......
CmRih_VtVAs,Love Queen....terrible choice for this trailer. Really took away from the awesome shots and cool dialogue.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol, WTF is this? Some kind of fan movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a fun movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,todo sabe mejor con las canciones de queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks good, but the title cards are tragic."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes! Yes! Yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,what is song?
CmRih_VtVAs,HOL UP HOL UP
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared looks amazing!!! too bad no one can top heath
CmRih_VtVAs,"This has The Potential for a Sick  rated ""R"" movie.
Too Bad it's PG-13!"
CmRih_VtVAs,does anyone else think that WB should make this movie rated R and not PG-13
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks WAY better than any other DC movie so far!
CmRih_VtVAs,the first trailer that came out last year was decent but this one really captures the spirit of the suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,A couple cliche lines but I am pumped!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"#SuicideSquad - Official Trailer 1 _с одной стороны трейлер странный и ниочёмный, с другой хорош в динамике, с третьей - самое нелепое использование ""рапсодии""... с четвертой - у харли отличный зад :D_"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks good but the joker doesn't!
CmRih_VtVAs,zzzzzz
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love Retarded Movies <3
CmRih_VtVAs,I was really in to this until I saw Cara. When I watched Pan I was really disappointed to see her in that - I really don't like her :/
CmRih_VtVAs,They ruined it by putting will smith on the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm almost positive the song made 99.9 percent of this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,freaking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 for a moment I thought she was Emma Watson xD
CmRih_VtVAs,Masterpiece
CmRih_VtVAs,ohhhhh baby 1:56
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith's Deadshot is perfect ..
CmRih_VtVAs,Sorta reminds me of the guardian of the galaxy with the whole queen theme
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was getting so hyped up because apparently it was supposed to be coming out this month, but then I see AUGUST and now I'm just messed up"
CmRih_VtVAs,"SRY its the Voices , .... Thats not what they Really Said lol >.< she don't sound like Harley but she sho is Funny"
CmRih_VtVAs,if you're asking for the song name you're too young to be here
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best part was Capt. Boomerang, just taking a sip of a can of whatever that was and watching what was apparently a lot of explosions and blood."
CmRih_VtVAs,Song (s)?
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like a badass
CmRih_VtVAs,that moment when captain boomerang was havin a sip of cola 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK U JARED ! FUCK!
CmRih_VtVAs,not worth watching. But thanks for the Queen!
CmRih_VtVAs,Next year....Will Smith will win the Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of Deadshot. because of he doesn't his wife will morph into Killer Croc and eat us all.
CmRih_VtVAs,actually a pretty good trailer. the joker and harley are the weakest parts though they seem so forced..
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was a little skeptical at first (mostly due to the outfits and look of each character),  but after seeing this trailer, I think this might be good. It seems as though they will capture the essence of these characters just fine and make a fun action-packed movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,YAYYYYYYYY IVE BEEN WAITING Xoxoxox
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is a bisexual joke of an actor. He's only a caricature. Not ever to be taken seriously which is why he isn't nominated for Oscar. His best acting is fooling people he's heterosexual.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my favourite trailer of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,Шикарно
CmRih_VtVAs,"Weird, funny, violent, strange, and badass... 

It's Fucking perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,So they were going to make a good movie and then brought in Will Smith to make it suck? Glorious.
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay... now this is a badass trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So Close, Yet So Far....."
CmRih_VtVAs,If only BvS was like this
CmRih_VtVAs,nobody else acknowledging how awful the dialogue is?
CmRih_VtVAs,I just came
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not gonna lie the tone of this trailer feels really Guardians of the Galaxy to me :-/
CmRih_VtVAs,"i love how the artwork in the store window  says ""Si vis pacem para bellum""translating to if you want peace, prepare for war"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Eh, I'm not all that hyped for this movie anymore. The teaser was better."
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is badass as F
CmRih_VtVAs,"So simply by the logic of it being Suicide Squad, who do you think we're never seeing again? Harley's safe, and Deadshot has the power of being Will Smith."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The music is awesome, especially from 1:37"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love now I can see it, it's gonna be better than Batman V Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Спасибо, Данила"
CmRih_VtVAs,I am beyond fucking pumped for this movie. Deadpool and Suicide Squad in the same year? I'm such a happy fanboy these days.
CmRih_VtVAs,BATMAN V. SUPERMAN AND SUICIDE SQUAD! I LOVE THIS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kind of feels almost insulting that they used 'Bohemian Rhapsody' - insulting to Queen and the song, I mean.  Much better than the teaser, though Jared Leto still looks and acts awful; too short and way too much hardware in his mouth, he'd be much more sinister without it."
CmRih_VtVAs,*I went from skeptical to cautiously optimistic to hyped after this trailer*
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,is that cara delevigne??? omg
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'll forever believe the arrow and flash shows not being Conon are mistakes. I understand they're different production companies, but look at marvel!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Kill me. Fucking kill me. I don't know how to act, look or feel. This is everything I wanted and more. Fuck. Fucking fuck fúck."
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally DC ! this looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker is once again, a badass character
Judging Jared's performance over a picture was a mistake guys, perhaps now you see the amazing job he will do"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't like too much the beginning, but from minute 1:00 I love the edition between the scenes and the song!, nicely done!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hmm, I see they kept the cruddiest line from the teaser."
CmRih_VtVAs,its happening.....ITS FINALLY HAPPENINGGGGGGGGGG
CmRih_VtVAs,this is fucking embarssing
CmRih_VtVAs,Parker Posey would be a good HQ.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm here because of people writing ""SUICIDE SQUAD!!!"" in the comment section of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm screaming now.... Best song ever..... I loved this trailer....
CmRih_VtVAs,epic+
CmRih_VtVAs,"are they copying Guardians of the Galaxy trailer ? i was waiting for Peter Serafinowicz to pop up and say "" what a bunch of a hole"""
CmRih_VtVAs,I am really nervous about this joker the costume . the makeup isn't what I expected
CmRih_VtVAs,"2,250 people and counting don't like amazing movie trailers apparently. However good the movie might turn out to be, this trailer is fucking bonkers."
CmRih_VtVAs,gofundme.com/dukbm9dg help please....
CmRih_VtVAs,Literally Reddit: The Trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,GIVE US THE R RATING ON THIS MOVIE
CmRih_VtVAs,"The shot of Joker free falling was fucking awesome.
Movie looks great"
CmRih_VtVAs,the soundtrack was awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Mr. J, I can't wait to see your new toys too"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 harley's assssssss dayummm
CmRih_VtVAs,music?
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that there are a lot of points for originality here. Don't make your characters consigned to a list of traits; let them change and be different.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney finally found a role he'll excel in. Sneekily drinking a beer.
Really being Australian"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dead pool way better than this😝
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg best trailer ever. Bohemian rhapsody makes it perfect!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Bohemian Rhapsody music video ever...
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks good, but I liked this trailer better the first time I saw it, when it was called _Guardians of the Galaxy_."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey guys i make $600 a day from my computer at home drrrrrrrrrr
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome I want to see it now
CmRih_VtVAs,that ass 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07, SI VIS PACEM PARA BELLUM, ""If you want peace, prepare for war""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice use of bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,captain boomerang drink some soda? HILARIOUS
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks pretty fucking stupid lol...
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I have never been so hyped for a movie to come out!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"épica música, épica película,... simple"
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara is bae
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks beyond corny
CmRih_VtVAs,"FINALLY!!! A great trailer! Unfortunately, there isn't much more new stuff you can do with Joker without pushing it to an R rating.....which I REALLLLLY Want. Give us a directors cut!!!!! #MarvelDCUnited"
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer Kicks major ass!!!!:-)
CmRih_VtVAs,"woooaah!! Bohemian Rhapsody never sounded so BADASSS!! \,,/"
CmRih_VtVAs,This and the last trailer are night and day. That last trailer had a waaaaay different crappy edgy tone. This trailer is David Ayer doing David Ayer shit. And god damn it's exciting.
CmRih_VtVAs,okay. i'm a lil interested.
CmRih_VtVAs,it would be nice if there would be R rated version as well.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn GOOD GAW!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,MmmmmmmmmYEEES
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanted to like this film but the trailer is kinda naff
CmRih_VtVAs,It is just me or poison Ivy is in the trailer too? the scene of the train seems like a mutant plant or something like that
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that Cara Delavinge?
CmRih_VtVAs,i feel the joker will be one the bad guys...
CmRih_VtVAs,"First trailer was way better in my opinion. They actually seemed like psychopaths. Here, they just seem more like rebels or something in between. Not really villains and that ""We're bad guys. It's what we do"" line doesn't cut it. Cringe worthy as fuck. The ""Worst. Heroes. Ever"" line also kind of sucks. Sounds like a fifteen year old girl came up with it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Slipknot punches a woman. Very un-PC.
CmRih_VtVAs,As a marvel and DC fan...i FUCKING WON LOTTERY in 2016 :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, that's what you call trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,damn joker looks sexy
CmRih_VtVAs,Colorful DC😎
CmRih_VtVAs,IRRAAADOOOO
CmRih_VtVAs,The blonde chick makes me want to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,I was in the minute i heard bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,that blonde a baddie
CmRih_VtVAs,Badass trailer :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Mejor que civil mierda
CmRih_VtVAs,I got hyped when I heard Freddie Mercury!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith plays Will Smith, and he better get a goddamn Oscar nod for it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"batman, hot topic edition"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I thought the ""we're bad guys, it's what we do"" was sooo cute."
CmRih_VtVAs,I just cried tears of unadulterated joy
CmRih_VtVAs,www.gofundme.com/saraheducation
CmRih_VtVAs,all of a sudden I thought Freddie Mercury is still alive :(
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey everyone I was given this link to pass and share www.gofundme.com/saraheducation please donate if you can. Any amount is appreciated thank you
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 lool let's drink a monster energy he said hahaha :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Someone please tell me, who is the person at 1:28? I mistook him for Tom Hardy so many times! LOL"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great trailer for the Suicide Squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,I changed my mind. Margot Robbie is doing a hella good job at Harley. Love it.Cannot wait to see it xx
CmRih_VtVAs,"meh, i may actually watch this in theater. hm"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Amazing! only harley messed it up in the scene with ""the voices"""
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is by far the best part!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,So are people excited about the film or simply because they played Bohemian Rhapsody? From the comments it looks like the latter.
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the BEST TRAILER EVER .... perfectly synced with one of THE BEST SONG EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"All I got to say....More Mayhem, More Insanity, More SUICIDE SQUAD!!! Just don't be saving any people. You are bad guys and be bad guys!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I keep on watching this over and over
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the music? Pls help.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Fredy Mercury de fondo esta buena la musica
CmRih_VtVAs,Emilioooo Emiliooo..
CmRih_VtVAs,"That Native from Canada Got Jacked!!!    i want too hug his Muscles! Hug me Big Bear!   i hope saying Native isn't Rascit, why are we so sensitive? i know it takes Generations to forget some things, but anyone with a 3rd grade education can admit we are going in the right direction!  at least i hope so.      Hug Everyone!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The face jared leto makes at 1:23 is actually kind of terrifying
CmRih_VtVAs,I just cam in my pantaloons
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a marvel fan....this trailer is fucking awesome!
Can't wait to see the movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,They choose an indian guy to play Slipknot i'm so happy !
CmRih_VtVAs,garbage.
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain boomerang yesssssss ❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,I dare someone to wear a deadpool costume and scream fuck.suicide squad XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Poison ivy at 1:53
CmRih_VtVAs,And Harley is just fucking amazing :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think @1:43 or @1:44 at the subway scene.. that ""thing"" is probably the Common's character who is named 'Tattooed man'. Just a guess"
CmRih_VtVAs,"From the trailer, this looks like a film that doesn't know what it's supposed to be."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This makes me like Captain Boomerang AND Jai Courtney. 

What. The. Fuck."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like the best superhero movie this year!
CmRih_VtVAs,Ayer has done good. Especially Captain Boomerang! By far the most stand out person on the Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,This made more excited than any disney movie released!
CmRih_VtVAs,"not sold on will Smith playing deadshot, but other than that it looks like an awesome movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,what mate? worst trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so much better than Batman v superman. not a marvel killer but the most excited I've been for a dc movie since the dark knight trilogy
CmRih_VtVAs,See... music makes it all different. Add fun music and show bunch of people dead with clever narration/lines... you got a wider audience... do like the teaser of this movie with grim music... we just go back
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy fuck,  this is how you make a trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,After DC fucked up Batman v Supermen I must say I'm surprisingly hyped for Suicide Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can´t wait to show you my TOYS ..... EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I find it sad that some people will not know the song. One of the best Queen songs ever
CmRih_VtVAs,1:03 Gorgon?!
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best trailer I've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate to be negative, but I really don't think Jared Leo's going to be a very good Joker... Heath Ledger left some HUGE shoes to fill."
CmRih_VtVAs,"once again, Will Smith destroys any want to see a movie that has Will Smith in it. The guy cant act like another character, it always comes across as ""Will Smith acting like Will Smith in x character's clothing."" Same shit with Jason Stathum, they cant do a role unless they are allowed to be themselves like its in their contract or something. This still looks like shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody in a superhero movie trailer?
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"On the Marvel trailer comments: Rip DC
On the DC trailer comments: Rip Marvel
Y'all disloyal af smh. Great trailer though."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Already read the comic 10 years ago; 

Skip."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 She has little ass but still I'm like GOODAYUMM!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,OK I really wanna see this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,is that Jake Gyllenhaal at 1:36??
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit!
CmRih_VtVAs,"literally dying, i love this"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dam good trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:59, Joker and Harley in the 'Chemical pit"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Also Margot Robbie will blow up.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Shame there isn't a little more BAWSTUN accent on Harley, but it'll do."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst. Heroes. Ever
Best. Trailer. Ever"
CmRih_VtVAs,at 2:04   I can see  Harley Quinn like a living comic book .....!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"All the noobs, wondering why the Joker is in a movie *without* Batman."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was given only one choice, I would choose to see Suicide Squad over Batman v Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,this  was  so  awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,is this movie rated r ?
CmRih_VtVAs,theres to much happening in 2016 XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC (or warner bros) must be bipolar when it comes to making trailers, because this trailer is fucking  great, whereas the Batman vs Superman trailer left me utterly disappointed, but I think that the whole moods of the films are different."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like it could be a classic.  Sort of reminds me of ""Warriors""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hyyyyyyyyppeee!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like Harley Quinn could have been better
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie also known as the hot wife from wolf of wall street
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like Marilyn Manson :D
CmRih_VtVAs,They should have a Deathstroke cameo or at least introduce his character
CmRih_VtVAs,подпишитесь на мой канал и на том спасибо
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one spicy dank movie
CmRih_VtVAs,That Joker is kind of shit (my opinion) but the trailer is awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,4 mil views already.
CmRih_VtVAs,queen!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I love me some Bohemian Rhapsody!!!!!! Hell yeah!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'ts amazing!!!!
Harley and Joker the great love"
CmRih_VtVAs,batman
CmRih_VtVAs,this will be a fucking comedy ...
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is finally stepping up their game :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"expectaculaaaar el trailer,esta mortaaal....¡¡¡¡suicide squad promete ser genial.espero que no defrauden.....¡¡aguante el joker de Leto¡¡¡¡haa haaa haaa haaaa ¡¡"
CmRih_VtVAs,So whos the antagonist? Are they fighting the joker? Is Batman in it? Is Superman in it? Does this entire movie hinge on how well that Robbie girl can act crazy?
CmRih_VtVAs,MARGOT ROBBIE IS STILL FUCKING HOT GOD DAMN
CmRih_VtVAs,yikes
CmRih_VtVAs,I could only focus on the music. They staged the music perfect!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,who sung with Freddie lol
CmRih_VtVAs,dead shot doesn't look like dead shot and joker doesn't look like joker at all they kinda fucked up with the casting high key
CmRih_VtVAs,1:13 ..Will Smith's firing guns is badass !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,F*ck civil war..Squad all day
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok I have to say now that now both the Star Wars trailer and this Suicide Squad trailer are the best I've ever seen the 1st Suicide Squad railer was meh but putting Queen's Boheman Rhapsody is just Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I may see it...
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck you nerds and fuck your comics
CmRih_VtVAs,A pretty good trailer my worries where that the movie would be too dark and depressing but now that i've this trailer i think this movie will be really good it will be dark but still let you have fun with the action and characters.
CmRih_VtVAs,"My guess:

This movie is going to be the best super hero movie ever and puts DC back in the game OR it's going to be a giant flop and DC is fucked.


I hope the first one......"
CmRih_VtVAs,Музыка хорошая..
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is just playing Will Smith again. The actual surprise is that Jai Courtney seems like he may actually be likable in this movie. Otherwise Joker, Harley seem fine. Killer Croc's CG looks....troublesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie is way to distracting ...
CmRih_VtVAs,when the joker does not own the trailer it makes me worry . leto has such a whiny voice in comparison to Ledger. not that imposing. the soundtrack really enhances average content
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker's suit are awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Sometimes I wonder if Heath was still alive he would play the joker in this movie 😕
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats 1.57 supposed to represent
CmRih_VtVAs,The first trailer was the more serious side and this one was a lot more comical. I like that.
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,If I see any comments asking what song that was.... I'll find you and force you to listen to Queen for hours until you learn your place in this universe.
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a trailer without the Inception horns!
CmRih_VtVAs,"EXCELLENT use of Bohemian Rhapsody
One of the best trailers I've seen in a WHILE"
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn she is batshit fuckin crazy. I want a girl like that.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else watch the trailer then re-watch it again, pretending you've never seen it before and then repeating again like 10 more times?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker's laugh is wonderful, just that bit different to what we've heard before. Excellent work."
CmRih_VtVAs,Boom that's it I'm sold  it's like a darker tone version of Guardians Of The Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,I just wish The Joker didn't look like puke.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Надеюсь, будет норм"
CmRih_VtVAs,"... Suicide Squad, the feel good movie of the year!....great song, bad trailer... Is this movie now shit... Or did it become shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's the clue in this movie ? Who's against who ? Everyone's just shooting at each other, boring..."
CmRih_VtVAs,MY GOD!!! THE AWESOMNESS IS OVER 9000!!!!! THIS JOKER IS AMAZING!!! CANT WAIT!!
CmRih_VtVAs,damn i like this Harley Quinn chick a lot
CmRih_VtVAs,Hate Will Smith now... after him pushing his shitty son on us and now his Oscars are racist comments... his career is nearing it's end I reckon
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto seems to be having a blast, along with everybody else."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""we´re bad guys, its what we do"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Still looks way better than Batman Vs Superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,azazazazazazaza!)
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna like it but I just cant
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys"" (slap) (slap)"
CmRih_VtVAs,epic Bohemian Rhapsody is epic .
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Well.... Just me or was this freaking perfect? I'm still gonna put em back to Arkham tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait, it's gonna be the best, ""Us too, right?"" ""Well Guardians of the Galaxy went blockbuster and that was an utterly mediocre movie, let's do the same thing!"" film of 2016, besides the 43 Marvel movies being made."
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is the best year ever!! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Goddamn this looks tame
CmRih_VtVAs,...
CmRih_VtVAs,"After watching this trailer, it's hard not to think about what Deadpool could have achieved in terms of audience numbers and hence, box office numbers had it been rated PG-13."
CmRih_VtVAs,07538 776835
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 :3 oh boy ...... BUT SHE HAVE NO BUTT TO SHOW GODDAM
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 who's the one on the right?
CmRih_VtVAs,Spioler :the guy with the tattoos on his face dies...
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadshot is White ??
CmRih_VtVAs,That's how you make a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great. Song. Choice.

With all the shitty DC/WB movies lately, this one gives me hope. Also, as being the biggest fan of Harley Quinn, I am more than excited to see her on screen."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bring on the Suicide Squad! 
Batman makes a cameo, but it's not a Batman movie. And I do not want to see Superman, at all. 
Going from the Bee Gees to Queen was a surprise and completely changed the tone, but the later was a sneak peak. This is the official first theatrical trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ya! Fuck where i Shit!            Please?
CmRih_VtVAs,worst movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Letos laugh didn't really sound like a joker laugh to me
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst heroes ever?
I agree, you can't have a fucking crocodile saving people.
He's meant to eat them."
CmRih_VtVAs,I lost the ability to even omg i cannot
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like a movie for 10 year olds...
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF!!! this trailer gave away the ending  2:32  What a troll :(
CmRih_VtVAs,WORST TRALIER EVER LMFAO!!!!! LOOKS LIKE THEY COPIED AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON WITH A MIXTURE OF FANTASTIC 4... WTF...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, i have to admit, that music fit perfectly."
CmRih_VtVAs,"That ""Whoooa"" by Harley gets me every time. ♥"
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK, just one more time and I am satisfied."
CmRih_VtVAs,MARGOT ROBBIE LET ME FUCK YOU
CmRih_VtVAs,Hit like those who fell in love with Bohemian Rhapsody once again! :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't wanna wait until August! This is gonna be such an awesome movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,you know the only issues I actually have or had with wb and the trailers of bvs and suicide squad is the fact they released them a year + away from when the movies release like damn there shouldn't be a reason why I have to watch a trailer of something that far away from its release only video games are worst at doing stuff like that 2-3 years smh
CmRih_VtVAs,Whattt......
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn is so cute!
CmRih_VtVAs,"can't wait, must freeze myself."
CmRih_VtVAs,pause 1:24
CmRih_VtVAs,Might as well just call it the Joker Movie guest starring Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,👏🏻👏🏻Can't go wrong when U got Bohemian Rhapsody playin
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley and Joker designs are sub par in my opinion. Disappointed also that she lacks her trademark accent :/
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"2,000 marvel fanboys disliked"
CmRih_VtVAs,DAT TRAILER  MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for this than I am Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"BVS 1,4 billion
suicide squad 800 million"
CmRih_VtVAs,"SCREW BATMAN V SUPERMAN.
my 2016 is 
Deadpool 
10 Cloverfield Lane
Neighbors 2
and Suicide Squad... 

notice how I have them coming out soonest."
CmRih_VtVAs,A D.C. movie i want to see?
CmRih_VtVAs,"From dark to funny,well played"
CmRih_VtVAs,my birthday is in August ! yas
CmRih_VtVAs,so I have to wait all the way till august to watch it !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"u know if u watch a pic of Jared when h3 had beard and long hair.. he was okey and maybe cute too. I would NEVER think him as joker. but once he cut of that ombrè hair n beard. holy smokes he looked like someone else as if he was born to play Mr. J
I can't believe it's the same guy who played a transgender and now joker. I can't even  see that it's Jared but a real life joker!

heath was good in his version ofc so don't jump on me now. .."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited it's ridiculous!
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck I love ths trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet were not gonna hear this soundtrack in this  film..David Ayer just want to pump up the audience's heart on this
CmRih_VtVAs,now thats a trailer! entertaining without giving too much... awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,It might be possible that poison ivy is involved.
CmRih_VtVAs,FANT-ASSTIC TRAILER DC
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did some digging on Katana she has interesting story, and like the soul taker sword that she uses."
CmRih_VtVAs,"woah, I actually wanna see this, not batman v supes but this, this looks great!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer set the bar that every other trailer in 2016 is going to have to match or beat. It had the perfect synthesis of great music (you can't get much better than Queen), frenetic action, actors who seem to embody their characters well, with a heavy dose of sexiness from Margot Robbie. What more could you ask for?"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 WB always looking out for us
CmRih_VtVAs,What almost 4500000 views yesterday i saw it with only 500 view i thought no one was going to see the trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,"People wanted DC using more humour, here you go haters."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wtf is that at 1:44 😮Looks like a metal groot
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"want to listen more of that shit!! Type ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and enjoy the Queen.."
CmRih_VtVAs,LIT TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,This is one of my favorit songs + super heroes = IM SEING THIS THE MOMENT IT COMES OUT !!
CmRih_VtVAs,the song is bohemian rhapsody of queen¡¡¡¡¡¡
CmRih_VtVAs,0:46 how adorable :)
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07....yeah im watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,understand the comics that came out was old everybody in the movie had to update their villain so people can relate I like the changes
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,that guy looks like seth rogen... I wish I it was :p
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks so fucking sickkk
CmRih_VtVAs,understand the comics that came out was old everybody in the movie had to update their villain so people can relate I like the changes
CmRih_VtVAs,"like bohemian rhapsody however the song doesn't fit the trailer at all and it's another pg-13 movie full of anti heroes so screw you DC every damn movie about comic book characters has to be pg-13 so kids can watch it why is the movie industry so afraid to take risks by adding more dark mature humor at least deadpool is gonna be rated R meanwhile two more pg-13 horror movie flops are out cough... the forest, the boy they don't seem to be afraid of taking risks with those flops"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the kind of movie i have been waiting to come out
CmRih_VtVAs,Uou ! I'm addicted in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"no, this looks like shit, not DC, not Suicide Squad, not the movie that fans have been waiting years for. Whorely Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I stopped watching these lousy comic book film adaptations years ago, but this shit looks tight. The movie better live up to this awesome trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker in this doesn't deliver for me... Terrible!
CmRih_VtVAs,I absolutely love this cast <3
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks pretty low budget.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone just have a big grin on their faces when the music started  😃😃😃😃
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,All I see is Jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool is better...
CmRih_VtVAs,It still hurts me that we are getting a Joker that looks like a pimp.
CmRih_VtVAs,The cinematography in this movie looks beautiful. And it looks like they're using a lot of practical effects too which I love. Can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm only watching this film for Harley :-P
CmRih_VtVAs,OK.... maybe I'm a little excited now
CmRih_VtVAs,OOH MY FUCKING GOD IM SO EXIDED 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍♦️♦️♦️♦️😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"God, this looks sick. I have no allegiance to Marvel or DC, I just like good movies, especially comic book adaptations, so I'm hyped for this."

CmRih_VtVAs,квадрига ждем.
CmRih_VtVAs,DOES THIS HAVE ANY SPOILERS ?!?!?!?

CmRih_VtVAs,DC got me PUMPED UP
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen - super, movie - shift"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only joker I know is Heathe Ledger, why does this joker look like a fan boy version?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"yasss, jared leto."
CmRih_VtVAs,LOVEEEEE IT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the jokers body all mutilated and cut up? sure looks like it 1:58
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG IM SO EXCITED

CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this movie its going to be bonkers!
CmRih_VtVAs,blows the BvS trailer away. THIS is how you make a trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,Kevin Feige made 2.138 accounts to dislike this.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm for sure excited for this now for sure in my top 3 for this year
CmRih_VtVAs,Will this finally be the movie that actually makes me say hey Jai Courtney did pretty good i think it might be
CmRih_VtVAs,the song choice🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,"My friend bought me IQ recharge  hahahah

CmRih_VtVAs,4.1 million views in less than 24 hours... g*ddamn!  Keep it up!!!  #SuicideSquad
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool всех переплюнет
CmRih_VtVAs,Loved almost every piece of this trailer except for Harley's acting. Wasn't too convincing for me
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit they even bring back the young Clint Eastwood from the past.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be Batman & Robin all over again.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 yummie
CmRih_VtVAs,It just keeps getting better and better. 2016 is going to be an amazing year for films.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just want ask that in the next trailer, not to show the bad guy like u did in the batman vs superman... don't ruim everything again... great trailer!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,i just dont like the joker. Everything else looks great.
CmRih_VtVAs,All of my doubts about this movie have disappeared.
CmRih_VtVAs,Killer Kroc looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone should make tht intro as template! Its so awesome \m/ <3
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasn't that sold on the movie with the first trailer...but damn this was good
CmRih_VtVAs,this was done so well :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,I am now excited again
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how this trailer makes it more comical, and I think it's a great change in feel."
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's all that gooey, tendrily black stuff? Some of the soldiers look like they're covered in it. @1:15 and @1:51"
CmRih_VtVAs,заебись!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks really fantastic! Though that last line from Harley seemed really clunky... but I still have high hopes for this film!
CmRih_VtVAs,"vibrates loudly
FUCK ME WITH A SPLINTERED 2 X 4 I AM SO GODDAMN READY FOR THIS SHIT"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok Heath for me will probably always be #1 Joker for me (maybe by default), but Jared seems like a perfect badass fit for this version of Joker. Kill it Jared."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who's hyped to see this!!🙌😱
CmRih_VtVAs,I think my comment got deleted so man Jared Leto looks great as Jason Todd!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,this girl is a terrible Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"- 0:53 - Nightwing, Dick Grayson, infiltrated the behest of Batman in Squadron look at the tattoo on his arm makes mention of the Flying Graysons !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one really doesn't like this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the real trailer?? is this just fantasy?
CmRih_VtVAs,song anyone?
CmRih_VtVAs,The last trailer was made of awesome. This one is made of hilarious.
CmRih_VtVAs,mais um trailer pra assistir repetidas vezes
CmRih_VtVAs,I have watched it 22 times already. I am addicted to this trailer. What a masterpiece!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hmm, think this Joker is growing on me. Still not 100% on the design but the acting is selling it well."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best use of bohemian rhapsody since Wayne's world
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't have the proper words to describe my happiness now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Mee encantaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIEEET
CmRih_VtVAs,why is there so much hate? The trailer looks great!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is so gross. He doesn't belong here at all. Such a forgettable, one dimensional actor. What a weird role for him."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this trailer is misleading. The song kind of changed the tone & perceptions. Smart. This movie is darker.. if you mute it then watch you notice Boomerang hiding. Harley's crazy etc. This movie is about to surprise a lot of people.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad: Rise of the Edge Lords 
;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"From the trailer, I can already tell that they've tried to hard to make Joker edgy. Like the tattoos and grill is just making the whole thing look forced."
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadshot with his trademark wrist-mounted guns! Aww yeah that's all I want
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like a poorly-written, contrived film.  Harley's lines are forced, and it would be more subtle if they just had big blinking letters saying, ""She's insane!  Get it?!"".  They did focus on the more ""comedic"" elements in the trailer, but the tone has the same dreary, dismal look as the other ""grimdark"" DC movies.  Amazes me that they can do the TV shows so well, and whiff on the films.  But hey, that's just my opinion.  If you're looking forward to it, then good for you."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinns ass.....
CmRih_VtVAs,재밌겠당. ♡
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP MARVEL!
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't fuck this up warner
CmRih_VtVAs,It's almost like they want me to take pants off.
CmRih_VtVAs,great trailer!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,why is that model girl even given an act in a blockbuster??
CmRih_VtVAs,"crazy badasses, luv them😈❤🔥"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nice Work, hoping for a good Movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,is this a real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by QUEEN goes well with the theme...
Though it was N still is a mystery, what actually prompted Freddie Mercury to pen it."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is amazing! Can´t wait for this movie :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm Marvel and I have to admit this looks pretty cool! Loving the music choice and how well it syncs with the images
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley... She will be mine.
CmRih_VtVAs,Con el Disco de Queen me convencieron! quito todas las criticas que e dicho!!! T.T
CmRih_VtVAs,damn Harley quinn got ass
CmRih_VtVAs,dc is awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a Marvel fanatic, this looks amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,">DUDES VOICES LMAO

>HEY EVERYONE, I WANT TO INFORM YOU I HAVE VOICES IN MY HEAD LMAO

>LE QUIRKY UNIQUE PERSONALITY IN THE MIDDLE OF SERIOUS MEN LMAO

Fucking try hard Reddit movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:28 that laugh, like the one from the first trailer, will also give me nightmares!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really want to like the trailer, but I don't. Honestly it seems poorly written, I mean like they were trying to do too much all at once though I hope it exceeds all expectations!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst. Movie. Ever
CmRih_VtVAs,hmm not sure what to think of Harley Quinn. she my favorite DC character. just hope the actress does Harley Quinn real good
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love this so much, perfect music, perfect trailer, perfect new joker! Leto is gonna be awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if this will be put in the musical/comedy category
CmRih_VtVAs,Still can't get over how they used Bohemian Rapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks Captain Boomerang/Jai Courtney looks like Tom Hardy in this trailer??
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thats how you do a trailer!! you gave nothing away while compelling me to watch it!!!
Bat V Sups take note .......coz your trailers weren't worth shit!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes please
CmRih_VtVAs,DESMAIADO!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🎆🎊🎉💕
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope death stroke shows up one point in the movie even a cameo will make my day
CmRih_VtVAs,soooo excited...
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44?pause
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 Year of the Anti-Hero
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn and Killer Croc, two of my favorite Batman villains are in this movie :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love suicide squad and with the teaser trailer and this official trailer I just cannot like this movie. I've tried so hard to see the good in it but I just HATE it. My biggest issue really is the casting to be honest and the design for some of the characters specifically Killer Croc and Joker. I love that they have stuck to the source material and kept it dark and decided not to water it down so all the kids could see it.

 killer croc is one of my all time favourite batman villains but they just made him look like a big bloke covered in talcum powder. Worst of all is Joker with Jared Leto taking the helm and trying to big himself up by doing crazy stuff on the set to make us believe he is actually going to do well. I also despise the look I mean what the hell were they thinking? they have just made the most iconic batman villain a anorexic albino with loads of tatoos. I refuse to watch this movie and felt I had to get my opinion out there. I know there will be a bunch of haters and people who agree with me so I couldn't care less really."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ermano la voy haber altoke
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the HOTTIE @ 1:43 on the right?  WOW!!
CmRih_VtVAs,yup cant wait for this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,¿ 1:43 What's that? ¿ 1:58 What's he wearing?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now THAT'S what i call a trailer! Super hyped for the movie to come out. Now as long as you dont suddently release a trailer showing Deadshot killing the Joker or Wonder Woman showing up or Doomsday tearing shit up or something, the movie is looking good, funny and dark and interesting as hell! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,the trailer made me remember of secret life of walter mitty
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like they are taking a comedic page out of D E AD * P O O L
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn looks too sexualized. Other than this complaint the movie looks fantastic
CmRih_VtVAs,"whoa Scott Eastwood is in it definitely a movie that I will get on blu Ray and see in the theatre, and double whoa for movie with the joker and Harley in it"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm going to enjoy this sssooo much #skwad
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best trailers I have ever seen in my life good god thats great.
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm in love with Harley 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Kinda tops Wayne worlds bohemian rhapsody video
CmRih_VtVAs,"The story is so not what I thought it was going to be. Matter of a fact, it looks to be even better than what I thought it was gonna be."
CmRih_VtVAs,"We’re bad guys, it's what we do."
CmRih_VtVAs,ok now Harley Quinn is mine :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is surely close to Nolan's success, critically and financially"
CmRih_VtVAs,Such a shame that this trailer sucks because I was looking forward to this movie also Bohemian Rhapsody really does not go with this trailer at all.
CmRih_VtVAs,like for saundtrek Queen forever!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,what mission they need to accomplish?
CmRih_VtVAs,Margo is crazy sexy !! 👯😜
CmRih_VtVAs,fck marvel fck DC. im still wating for Rush Hour 4
CmRih_VtVAs,i really wish margo would use harley quinns actual voice. the look is spot on but the voice jus isnt harley
CmRih_VtVAs,I still like the other trailer more.
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking fantastic
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I saw a bronson reference
CmRih_VtVAs,"My crappy movie sense is tingling.  It isn't usually wrong.  Too bad, the first trailer raised my hopes that it wouldn't be shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my 2nd most anticipated movie of the year my first is batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Did not know that you could make Queen's music even more bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith is my favorite actor but i wont lie.... im not seeing dead shot... jus will smith being will smith. his sarcasm is on point but still jus off.
CmRih_VtVAs,A nice trailer with really good music.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well that didn't tell me shit about that movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm really looking forward to this movie. My only issue is Harley's accent. Her personality is spot on though. Just weird hearing the character without her normal accent is all. Joker's personality was fucking amazing though. I was a little skeptical before with the last trailer but now I'm really looking forward to seeing Leto's full performance!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What happened in Katana's eyes in one scene???
CmRih_VtVAs,harley not crazy enough
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'll be right back.. I'm going to go slap some pink and white make up on my wife's ass and give her a bat, AND HAVE CRAZY SEX!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"fuck this looks orgasmic dude, i got shivers down my spine"
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet this will be more entertaining than the misleading batman vs superman movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Edge
CmRih_VtVAs,They are trying really hard to beat Guardians Of Galaxy soundtrack.
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED THIS IS
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys it's what we do."" <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so cool!!!!!! cant fucking waittt
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so ready for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 When my friends talk about Captain America Civil War while im sitting here like..
CmRih_VtVAs,What the fuck is going on !
CmRih_VtVAs,YES HARLEY YESSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,its harley show
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks fuckin awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker is jumping into a tub of chemicals it looks like and it shows him holding up Harley Quinn in it. Also judging from the 1st trailer where she's tied up and Joker says he's not going to kill her, I'm assuming they're combining both of the origin stories of Harley Quinn pre and post New 52. The psychologist meets Joker at Black Gate Prison and later after freeing him he takes her and pushes her into the same vat of chemicals he fell into."
CmRih_VtVAs,"the line We're bad guys and that's what we do? so we are going more a one minded hero and villen perspective then? 

Suicide Squad seem to be ok at parts, so see how this film goes."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dam batman made so many accounts to dislike this
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody makes it better!
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY!....Where's that adorable Brooklyn accent we all love?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:21 gold ak-47 thats my kinda joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Just take my money please
CmRih_VtVAs,Great use of Bohemian Rhapsody !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:57 I hope those tattoos come off!
CmRih_VtVAs,"2056 Dislikers are doritos eating fat unsocial marvel fanboys who hates the fact that Dc is stepping up their game and making better movies than marvel now.  They just want to see more Avengers: ""Its family comedy"" superhero movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,Scott Eastwood as Agent Grayson ??? :)
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a boner
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it can't see how people hate on something that's not out yet
CmRih_VtVAs,Gave like for Bohemian Rhapsody. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"People need to stop comparing this to GOTG this is nothing like them at all. The only thing similar is the old songs they pick for their trailers. I am sick of Marvel vs DC, I know most of you all will be watching both movie franchises so it really doesn't matter who is better. the fans of both win."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm guessing I'm the only one that wasn't impressed by this trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,¿Why Cara Delevingne is not in the credits? ¿Por qué no aparece el nombre de Cara Delevingne en los créditos?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Movie looks really cool, still not feeling The Joker and I don't know if I ever will, I'm sure Jared's performance will be excellent but they fucked up hard on his design."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I just came
CmRih_VtVAs,"About the best movie ever, I'm getting chills"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like DC's Guardians of the Galaxy only with bad guys. Not sure if gusta
CmRih_VtVAs,"this version of the Joker will take some work to Batman
awesome !!!!thanks DC/warner
it all starts on March 24!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man, I hope Batman V Superman and this movie does well. I want to enjoy two cinematic universes"
CmRih_VtVAs,yessssss....  *impatiently waiting.
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn is pretty much the useless  member in this team
CmRih_VtVAs,"that scene when Joker leapt, chills man"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Mama, Just Killed a Man.. Best Song Ever.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:30, that IS the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer got me all kinds of excited! Jared Leto looks awesome as the joker! I CANT WAIT NOW!
CmRih_VtVAs,Qinn isnt gonna die isnt she?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be good
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44  Groot???  NNOOOOOOOOO!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This would be a lot cooler if I was 12
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ohhh....I liked the joker in this trailer, he might not be as bad as I thought."
CmRih_VtVAs,compare to this dead pool is children movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Angry Grandpa is finally in the asylum lmao!!! 0:05, 0:10"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:29 .......just pause it and look around for a couple minutes.
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel Cinematic Universe 2008-2016
CmRih_VtVAs,I am beyond excited for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"When the Joker says ""oh, I'm not gonna kill ya"". ""I'm just gonna, hurt you, really, really bad"". He's saying this to Harley and gives her a lobotomy. This explains why she is the way she is in this version."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith never should have been cast. He ruins it.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie is going to rock
CmRih_VtVAs,Came here for joker got a epic trailer 
CmRih_VtVAs,cool trailer but where the fuck is Harley's accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,That's a great ASS!!!!! I don't remember anything else..
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer totally got me for the SONG!!! Brilliant mix :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"STOP.FUCKING.UP.ALL.MY.FAVORITE.THINGS
you already ruined resident evil, just go back to that shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I LOVE the tone and colors on the movie. Whole cyan and magenta, just screams CRAZY ENERGY all over the place. I'm more excited for BvS because of the legacy, the plot, the mythical characters and the dark tone, but holy this movie is gonna be a joy to watch! It looks SO DAMN FUN!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever cut this trailer together needs a raise.
CmRih_VtVAs,You can never go wrong by having Queen in your movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Song names please, anyone ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie will either be fucking epic or the biggest disappointment since the phantom menace for me...
CmRih_VtVAs,this will be so much FUUUUN. ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,batman meets avengers!!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG DC -- You actually make it look like a movie might be fun...are you feeling ok - do you have a fever?
CmRih_VtVAs,WHERE IS SARAH PALIN?
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker.. thats the only reason..
CmRih_VtVAs,Well done Mr. Editor
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this is how you make a trailer. It looks great, and it doesn't give too much away (*ahem* BvS trailer) I mean, I know very little about the Suicide Squad, but this has me pumped."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wish they showed more of Captain Boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm pleased to see that most featured films now are being shot in iMax.
CmRih_VtVAs,Completely different tone than the other trailer but it looks fun af. Although it resembles the marketing for guardians of the galaxy a lot. I'm already more excited for this than batman v superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:08 0:41 0:52 1:14 1:18 1:51 1:54 2:02  and of course 2:07. Best of the film.💦
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish Harley Quinn had her whiny NY accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,God Captain Boomerang is such a boss
CmRih_VtVAs,"Adam beach? adman beach? ADAM BEACH?, lol awesome!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Algun Latino...
Ecuador!!! Presente.. :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my god there's color in a DC movie!?!?!?!?...... THATS IMPOSSIBLE!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody brought me here!
CmRih_VtVAs,the music alone makes the trailer so fricking cool (it mashed so perfectly with the scenes) excited!!!! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,excuse my brain fart earlier lmfao I feel dumb bohemian rapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,chujowe na maxa
CmRih_VtVAs,So this is how you exactly ruin a very good movie with an equally bad trailer. DC is supposed to be dark .I was actually hyped the way they portrayed the teaser But this one just killed all my hype.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney looks like he'll be good in this movie. The world is full of surprises.
CmRih_VtVAs,"last night 499k views.
this morning 4.2 million views."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks oddly familiar..
CmRih_VtVAs,"It is a strategy, they put a great song to draw attention, as the movie is that it sucks....!!!!!!!! Only good thing about the movie is harley and her sexy body. People will go to see this movie just for that girl :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad Teaser was the best trailer I've ever seen. Until now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Movie Trivia: Jared Leto in the third Oscar winning actor to portray the 'Joker'.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's pretty obvious that the tentacled monster is really Jason Todd...
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MY FUCKING GOD BOHMIAN RAPSODY!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Brainiac?
CmRih_VtVAs,Im sold clint eastwoods son is in this.
CmRih_VtVAs,i use to like joker/leto but this trailer made me say mehhhhhhhhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,"2,037 thumbs down must be butt hurt marvel fanboys this is awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dope as hell
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared is gonna nail his joker. I can already see it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Good trailer, but it was the song that gave me chills... so amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,What a shit ass casting.
CmRih_VtVAs,And I Thought My Jokes Were Bad
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie will completely steal batman v supermans thunder. watch
CmRih_VtVAs,czekam :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Possibly the greatest trailer ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M SO FUCKING READY
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or are the badguys usually more fun? Oh and Harly is hot
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking LOVE it!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is already Jai Courtney's best performance since....well, ever."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley has to say puddin' at least once in one of these DC movies.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably one of my favorite all time trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks good.  Has that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" feel to it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is Batman??????
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a marvel fanboy and I thought this movie would be crap but I have to say that this trailer sold me I'm actually pumped to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,That's so MARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,Bismillah!
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the way that people are hating so much on batman v superman and nit picking every flaw then this epic trailer comes and nobody got shit to say
CmRih_VtVAs,Alexander😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,We need Teens or Elders or YouTuber's React to this video.
CmRih_VtVAs,What a year for movies this will be can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,oh shiiiieeeeettt dis gun git gud.
CmRih_VtVAs,they have the money to buy queen music copyright so this movie got to be good
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is PERFECT for Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie will steal the spotlight from everyone else. I'm sure of it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie > Jennifer Lawrence
CmRih_VtVAs,epiiiiiic.
CmRih_VtVAs,POISON IVY??????????????
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont like this. nothing of value to get me hooked in the trailer so probably wont be seeing when it comes out. great actors i admit but roles they fill seem not interesting
CmRih_VtVAs,the hype
CmRih_VtVAs,looks gash
CmRih_VtVAs,"I thought I could fap to Harley Quinn, but...nevermind, I'll wait till the movie comes out. :v"
CmRih_VtVAs,You know when Casey neistat edits a video
CmRih_VtVAs,V.VERY NICE
CmRih_VtVAs,"@1:37 thats where I'm done
Jared Letos laugh tho!"
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone else amped? Just me?
CmRih_VtVAs,E P I C !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Any trailer with bohemian rhapsody as a soundtrack, is pretty awesome in my opinion."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC > Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Best use of Bohemian Rhapsody. Ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,please hurry August
CmRih_VtVAs,YEAH THATS THE FUN IM LOOKIN FOR DC!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone who can relate to Batman: Assault on Arkham?
CmRih_VtVAs,BR?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 I'm Groot? 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love Cara sooooooo the Movie is Great.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like the look of joker and harley.  That's ruining this movie for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Again with the Marvel vs DC thing?
I loved Guardians of the Galaxy. The setting, the characters and the music, everything was great.
But guess what, I also want this movie to be great. I don't give a fuck to which group it belongs, I just want more and better movies!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto is perfect for The Joker, I can't wait!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still growing on me, but I will still see it because I love DC. I'd only change how Harley and Joker would look... Harley could of been a little thicker, like in The Arkham Trilogy and I am still not sold on Joker having tattoos on his face, body? That's fine but the face? Eh. Plus, the grill is bit too much in my opinion. He did looked creepy when he was laughing and shooting, so that's a good thing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks fantastic. Anyone really hope Scott Eastwood develops some acting chops so that he can fill his fathers role and be casted as roland for the dark tower.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life...
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 that would be me
CmRih_VtVAs,"People always flipping complaining. At first the trailer seemed gritty, people said it had no humor. Now, said trailer has humor and is somewhat wacky and chaotic and now they're saying they liked the grittiness of the first one better...it's the freaking Suicide Squad, can't they be... oh, I don't know, BOTH!!! Seriously though, this trailer's dope, movie's gonna be amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really hope they make Harley less ""quirky, crazy fan appeal"" and more ""oh I'm not really crazy that's a play oh look that's a knife in your throat""."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think the person at 1:44 is gonna be the main antagonist. I.e the guy they're tasked to eliminate. And the Joker and the Batman are just gonna get in their way from time to time throughout the movie. At least that's what I think. Just a theory.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is this a music video for Bohemian Rhapsody? Damn, there are many ways to promote a trailer but the filmmakers said, ""F""ck it. Let's repeat what Marvel has done to Guardians of the Galaxy and let's choose an awesome song through this dart: Bohemian Rhapsody! Its gonna beat that movie's whole 70's soundtrack!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 Shit is about to go down
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice. Now give me Gotham City Sirens.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, so, WB fucked up Superman V Batman with fucking Doomsday, but this shit looks fucking awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've noticed from all the new movies coming out, there using alot classic old school songs in there trailers like. (Deadpool) X Goin give it to ya by DMX, (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2)  Its Tricky by Run-DMC, and now (Suicide Squad) Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I lol'ed.. is this for real?

Good music.. movie sucks"
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect song for this !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be maaaaddd
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone else have a problem with Harley's the lack of an accent??!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is why heath ledger is better joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Playing Bohemian Rhapsody in this is probably the best choice ever made
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's quite funny that when DC posts a new trailer, etc. everyone in the comments is like ""RIP marvel"" or ""marvel your time is over"" but when Marvel posts a new trailer, everybody is like ""You can like both"" or ""stop that stupid dc marvel war"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Esse trailer ta bom demais
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that a Lazarus Pit at 2:00?
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking better than Batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nossa esse trailer foi muito foda, humilhou o trailer 1 👌🏻😂😘🙈"
CmRih_VtVAs,DAMN JAI COURTNEY HAHAHAHAHAHA
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney actually looks amazing in this
CmRih_VtVAs,Rayon is wearing a lot of make up here. why is he crazy? 😟 to much AZT and cocaine? Rayon whyyyyy? 😭
CmRih_VtVAs,actually kinda interested in seeing this now
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 look at that laughing face. the clown prince is completely fucking insane.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow that's all I can say wow
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP ovaries...
CmRih_VtVAs,I would have never thought to put a Queen song for a trailer like this lmfao pure genius.... awesomesause!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This Harley is not Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 Perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,"I start to believe, that Leto will be a very, VERY good Joker :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,I kinda get the feeling there's not gonna be much Rick Flag in this movie.. that's a bummer. He's the leader!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is my spirit animal.
CmRih_VtVAs,My only hope is that they don't spend half the movie introducing characters.  Just assume we know who they are and fill us in on the back story as the plot progresses.
CmRih_VtVAs,That awkward moment when the whole story movie is in the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,br akiii !!! mano o coringa ta mt foda!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,In this movie we can see anything about jasontodd? to see how will batman under the redhood will be? or just to confirm that there will be a batman under the redhood solo movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cock. Suckin. Fuckin. Awesome








What's the song used?





P.s don't say darude sandtorm/meme/dank/ or any about detonated wam k"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tá tranquilo, tá muito favorável."
CmRih_VtVAs,No one is a villain when everyone is
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 god damn, god damn"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great choice for music superb trailer  the suicicde squad comic movie  was not comical
CmRih_VtVAs,First trailer made look dark and deep as fuck. Now they're turning it into a comedy? I'm so confused...
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 pause
CmRih_VtVAs,does someone else has seen assault on arkham?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm going to watch the new Fantastic Four before I see this movie so I can get an artificial high when this KICKS ASS
CmRih_VtVAs,"song doesn't fit at all , first trailer is very crappy let's see the second."
CmRih_VtVAs,CARAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Viola Davis omg!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is he drowning her or sum ? 1;58
CmRih_VtVAs,Who ever made this trailer and the earlier teaser is a genius!!!!!!!!!!!!! Knows exactly what we want to see! Loving 2016 so far
CmRih_VtVAs,If only it was the Heath Ledger Joker ;_;
CmRih_VtVAs,I know Batman is only playing a small part but I hope it's a really awesome small part!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm totally erect right now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Not bad DC... not bad at all
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or does this look like a kids movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,This music in 25 years after Freddie Death !
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how they have the new Harley quin origin in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I gotta say Jai Courtney looks pretty solid here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, this sure looks great.. Although i don't know if anyone think this way but i feel that the Joker will be relegated and maybe it won't have much time on the screen. I hope i'm wrong but even is just for a few seconds, Leto surely will KICK ASS"
CmRih_VtVAs,''I should kill everybody and escape...SIKE JUST KIDDING !'' Harley funny af
CmRih_VtVAs,didnt like the first trailer but this one was great
CmRih_VtVAs,"I would rather have troy baker as joker, that voice do"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fucking gay. 



Nah looks good actually."
CmRih_VtVAs,One word : AWESOME !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,im laughing because half the people who havent read the comics think its gonna be like guardians ahahaha. read the comics its nothing like it. these people are locked up and used and if they dont obey orders they will be killed using a implant in their head. so its far different
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did I just watch the Perfect Trailer?
Yes... yes I did."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley looks hot but not using the iconic voice is a bad sign as well as casting Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang basically making him this film's Hawkeye. Also Jared's Joker laugh sounds like Palpatine so huge that's a huge concern right there.
CmRih_VtVAs,the hype is strong with this one
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so....bleh
CmRih_VtVAs,"they use the good old ""man this trailer sucks, let's use a well known song that people love and then perhaps it will distract them from how bad the film is"""
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't really have much faith in the DC Cinematic Universe at this point. But this is the one film i'm so fucking punped over that i want to scream like one of them Justin Bieber fangirls! I mean the casting in this film... All the crazy shit going on! It's just fucking sweet! Harley Quinn and Joker look fucking Amazing! Can't wait to see them in action! I thik we are going to see a fantastic joker in this film. As good as Heath Ledger? Don't know if i'm gonna place any bets on that... But no doubt a fantastic Joker! Can't wait to see him mess with Batman in the future! It's gonna be so much fun! So there's really just one character you have to nail to save the DC Cinematic Universe from total ruin.... Joker! As long as the Joker is good there's something to be pleased with. As long as Joker is good You can save the Batman films and what ever else you put him in! Bats V Sups has kinda lost me at this point. The Wonder Woman film i'm not to sure about... Alltough she looks kinda cool they've cast an actor that i honestly don't see as Wonder Woman material. I've never imagined Wonder Woman as the cute nice girl down the street that gives me a kiss when i fall of my bike and then tells me she has cookies. Wonder Woman is supposed to be like fucking buff and scary yet very sexy! But we'll have to wait and see. So far Suicide Squad has the entire DC Cinematic Universe in it's hands!
CmRih_VtVAs,Dude. yes
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07
CmRih_VtVAs,what? no batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey guys, the girl with the colorful hair looks like Jinx RIOT. Is that true?"
CmRih_VtVAs,❤
CmRih_VtVAs,0:36 it has a zipper...
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this trailer just kicked batman v supermans trailers ass! Now Im hyped as fuck! Time to to watch Batman:  Bad Blood to get  in the mood.
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally This Time The Theaters Won't Be Filled Up With 11 Year Old Kiddos
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailor ever
CmRih_VtVAs,trash
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks bad ass but I'm not feeling the Harley Quinn, she's missing something. idk
Joker looks good, I judged Jared Leto too soon."
CmRih_VtVAs,what a best year for comic book fans
CmRih_VtVAs,"so poison ivy is the main villian here!!!
sorry ppl 
joker some how manages to maniuplate poison ivy to destroy everything and suicide squad stands between them !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably the first dc movies that has better sense of humour
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney could actually pull off a good performance 0.0 
My hopes for this movie have intensified! Excited to see a superhero film that focuses on villains :) Nice breath of fresh air"
CmRih_VtVAs,I pooed a lil bit in excitement.....
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"nice song choice, really fits."
CmRih_VtVAs,<3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Feels like something that you'd watch, whilst on acid. On a side note; Margot might not have top billing. But, she will steal the show, for sure!"
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this shitty song? I don't think anybody knows this and I'm glad cuz it's terrible. If only they used a better song for this trailer like young thug or future but they make shitty movies what do you expect. This sounds like it's from a nerds bumhole
CmRih_VtVAs,YES YES YES DC FINALLY GETS IT RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:27 GOOSEBUMPS
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, real talk:

If I was 12, I would think this movie looked amazing. I'm a 24 year old adult though, and it looks like a bunch of lights and smoke, more style than substance. I love movies, I want to enjoy this one, but it looks like it's made mostly for/by man-babies.
Why can't I have a funny, violent, well-crafted movie that doesn't look like it's made for children?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my gosh...every role seems to be incredible perfect and absolutely crazy
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm excited for both Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman - Both look epic, DC universe is on the Rise"
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks REALLY good .
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn's ass tho
CmRih_VtVAs,I have to wait til AUG 5th???? T.T I guess I'll play this trail 100x more times.
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this trailer like 50 times...
CmRih_VtVAs,Where does he get those wonderful toys?
CmRih_VtVAs,Now THIS is a fucking trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,shit acting disguised by over stimulation
CmRih_VtVAs,"thats what we do we're bad guys. 
i love harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,I WANT THIS PLAYED AT MY FUNERAL!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:10 straight up ripping off Die Antwoord right there.
CmRih_VtVAs,Warner knows how to make a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"getting real sick of popular rock music on all trailer now days to touch everyone's vagina, and worship the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Sólo porque es Queen esto va a ser genial <3
CmRih_VtVAs,What ? What did i just watched? Serious trailer first now this?! Aweee... Dissapointed..
CmRih_VtVAs,"R.I.P Marvel





 I'm Marvel fanboy 
GOD JOB DC :) best trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,How come there are people who didn't like it? I think I'm in-love with Harleen . . . hihihihi
CmRih_VtVAs,Fran Drescher @ 1:00?
CmRih_VtVAs,Please stop making super hero movies
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks like finally someone gave Jai courtney a real character to play
instead of emotionless puppets in his previous films"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why other marvel fans hate this. Its not about how the music related to GOG. But its about how to make the movie better so maybe that's why they chose this kind of music. Can't we just give DC a shot. They are just starting but I think they are making a good start.
CmRih_VtVAs,that's a good ass trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,what comedy in a DC movie??? and it isnt that stupid little kid humor in Marvel movies  and it wasnt that retarded humor that was in the new BvS trailer??? holy fuck i have faith in DC again
CmRih_VtVAs,damn this shit is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,I knew Margot Robbie couldn't do a good Harley accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,I need this movie in my life
CmRih_VtVAs,Those of you who are thinking it's a comedy movie.....U R WRONG. It's totally serious. The trailer is simply showing laughs here to help us like some of this character who we have little to no idea about. Also it got Joker+Harley Quinn. So there will be joke......serious jokes
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith win will an Oscar for this for sure. lol
CmRih_VtVAs,After Cap. Boomerang popped that Can of soda or whatever with thag hesp sound i discovered that i will admire jai courtney's character
CmRih_VtVAs,Best movie trailer ever made.
CmRih_VtVAs,"HOLY SHIT!! This movie has made me restore hop for the DC cinematic universe, I'm sorry but the Batman V Superman trailer spoiled a lot and looked very underwhelming, but this Suicide Squad trailer was fucking amazing! Everything looks great so far it's just weather or not Leto can pull of Joker, so far so good👍 (this is coming from a Marvel fan)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is a refreshing breath of fresh air! The original SDCC Suicide Squad trailer had me worried that the movie was going to be grimdark, boring and R rated without any sense of humor. I feared that Suicide Squad was going to be a brooding and depressing Christopher Nolan affair but this trailer has been a pleasant surprise for me with it's Guardians of the Galaxy/The Incredibles vibe and tonality. It's nice to see a DC Comics movie that is fun, colorful and comedic and something that both kids, teens and adults can enjoy. I love the fact that Katana is going to a central character in this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY I LOVE YOU!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,My theory for joker's grills are from the constant beating from Batman. That would make the most sense
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 the fuck is that shooting the train?
CmRih_VtVAs,Im only watching this for Harley Ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"who's watching this trailer 10 times. This trailer was fantastic way better than the civil war, deadpool and Batman v Superman trailers. But yeah butthurt Marvel fanboys be like THIS SUCKS"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck Jai Courtney
CmRih_VtVAs,I love DC!
CmRih_VtVAs,Tfw nobody knows Katana
CmRih_VtVAs,n the laugh at 1:22 gave me the creeps lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"They are just copying Guardians of the galaxy with the ""Let's drop some random 80's hit songs"". It just doesn't even fit the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,My favourite part of this trailer was Capt. Boomerang opening and drinking his beer behind the car. I don't know why I found it so funny.
CmRih_VtVAs,looks fucking awful. the movie has no visual style. wil smith. im out.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney, actually trying and looks to be funny? What parallel dimension did I fall into?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot sounds a lot more like Harley in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" than she does in this. Nevertheless! Looking forward to it."
CmRih_VtVAs,n the trailer started good n at the end it lost me
CmRih_VtVAs,PLEASE DON'T SUCK PLEASE DON'T SUCK PLEASE DON'T SUCK PLEASE DON'T SUCK PLEASE DON'T SUCK
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is gonna be my crush for the year.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fucking amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Here we go...now Will Smith is going to want an Oscar for this too.
CmRih_VtVAs,pause at 2:07 you'll thank me later
CmRih_VtVAs,"to much will Smith, to little everyone else"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks like it doesn't know if it wants to be Guardians of the Galaxy or Man of Steel
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs up if you watched the trailer more then 10 times!! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,I  am more excited for this than bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,An R-rated comic made PG-13? No thanks.
CmRih_VtVAs,Excellent editing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy sh*t, a DC movie I'm actually looking forward to see?!God bless you, Queen, your music truly makes miracles!Also, Harley <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody X queen. For those wondering about the song
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok i will waiting while i'm watch over and over again this 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit! Somebody better call the Avengers!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever lol
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 1:51 i think it is Metallo
CmRih_VtVAs,+Bob f it was good but I want this movie to kick start DC so it has to be better n I think I dint feel the call
CmRih_VtVAs,What a perfect combo! Suicide Squad + Queen. 💀👑🎆
CmRih_VtVAs,any one else curious about who the hell is the guy blowing up the subway @ 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. This is a hella good trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,I was shaky about Jared Leto up until now...
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:57
I'm done."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, it's backed by Bohemian Rhapsody, so I guess it has ONE redeeming feature....."
CmRih_VtVAs,so he already is the joker why is he jumping into the vat of chemicals again??
CmRih_VtVAs,"watching the trailer made me feel like suicide squad is fighting against joker,am i wrong?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley and Dayum Joker, baby!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,"to the idiots sayin Harley dies at 1:58 - no, thts Ace Chemicals & shes falling into the the waste like joker did, he pushes her then dives in with her, thts her origin not her demise"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman Their both DC films , so what's the point of comparing again ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie will be the star of this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel fanboys disliked this video
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 Das Da Mudda Good Shit
CmRih_VtVAs,это сука так было охренненно
CmRih_VtVAs,My wallet warns me for this but I dont carrrreeeee
CmRih_VtVAs,"1.58-1.59, i see a love story cooking"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking Awesome!!  This is gonna be great!
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this about 10 times now and enjoyed it waaaaaaaaaay more than the BVS trailer. Less is more.
CmRih_VtVAs,That ass tho! 🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whether the movie is good or bad, THIS is how you make a trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,the song fits perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,August 2016 oh my gosh
CmRih_VtVAs,Crock looks Terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,BR CARALHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO QUE FODAAAAAAAA
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, thank God. We're getting an entertaining DC movie this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am pretty sure the line ""if you want peace prepare for war"" isn't on those shirts by chance."
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer was terribad.
CmRih_VtVAs,I Can't wait for this film
CmRih_VtVAs,did i see groot?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I liked the trailer. There's going to be a lot of gun action and the styling in the movie is great--I love a thugged out gutter punk type of Joker&HQ. They needed to show us some quirky/silly stuff as the first trailer was really dark. Now it's obvious this will be a good mix of dark origin stories and in your face action with hokey over the top dialogue (which I don't think was accidental and I'm okay with it.) If you're a Marvel purist, you probably won't like this, Marvel is known for it's comedy and tends to be well written. DC as far as movies has been quiet for a moment so we don't exactly know how things will stack up after this year. I know the depth of their villains blows Marvel villains out of the water. As a psych nerd, I've always enjoyed DC villains and seeing some of the greatest ones on film, all together, is going to be epic. This isn't Guardians, stop comparing. This isn't going to be 1/10th as family friendly. I love Marvel too but they are different animals."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks good...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fucking amazing :D
(I'm sorry but I can't find other words)"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have forever associated this song with Wayne's World.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like that pouch too harley
CmRih_VtVAs,DC-Version of Guardians of the Galaxy. Just a little bit more insane.
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody ❤
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ..... you're welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,The biggest takeaway from this trailer is that I'm more excited for Jai Courtney than the Joker. What is this world coming to?
CmRih_VtVAs,why the hell is Groot here?!
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best made trailers I've ever seen. Wow.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hype growing... This is what common crowd do
CmRih_VtVAs,I just hope Cara won't ruin this movie. I really don't like her acting skills.
CmRih_VtVAs,what's song on this video ?
CmRih_VtVAs,name of this music ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Fantastic Four with a evil Guardian's of the Galaxy Twist. I'm sold :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat song. <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay imagine this, and this would just be a great idea in my opinion. So Scott Eastwood is in this movie and rumor is he's playing Deathstrokes son. And since Batman has been retired and he's a bit more aged in this universe. Late 40s. Deathstroke would be older. Way older. What if they got Clint Eastwood to play Deathstroke. And he passes the mantle to His son (played by his actual son) I think it would be a great and fun idea. 1. We've never seen Eastwood play a Comic Book character, this would be a great choice. And 2. It'd be awesome if his suit is the more classic fish scale armor with that same ol' classic color scheme. And then he trains his son and teaches him what he knows. His son gets a more advanced more modern looking suit. Please read this I love this idea, and I hope it goes this route."
CmRih_VtVAs,"LOOKS FUCKING GREAT AND, HEY, LOOK AT ALL THAT NICE COLOR, OH HOW I'VE MISSED YOU!!!FACT!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,That's it! I have to watch this movie! It looks like it's going to be amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ermigohd.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone realised its Enchantress their actually fighting? Or do people still thinks it's Joker? Or batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me but the black and white drawing in the store window look sooooo much like Die Antwoord drawings ?? :P
CmRih_VtVAs,was that groot ? :P
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn! 👍👍
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What is this? Some sort of Cheerleading Squad?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,PUTA QUE PARIU.  O QUE É BATMAN V SUPERMAN OU CIVIL WAR PERTO DESSA DELICIA ?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS GONNA BE CRAZY
CmRih_VtVAs,They all die in the end.
CmRih_VtVAs,@John Cho *so
CmRih_VtVAs,Forget Star Wreck and Star Whores I wanna see  the Suicide Squad.
CmRih_VtVAs,who is that at 1:44? the one that shoots the oncoming train?
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who hit the replay like 800+ times?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why does America only make parody movies now?  I mean, adding Will Smith would do that to any movie, but this concept is almost as childish as Superman Vs Batman.. 

I suppose it's interesting that studios are giving multi million dollar budgets to 13 year old boys."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Such an epic trailer! Love Queen! This movie is do fuckin awesome, can't wait!"
CmRih_VtVAs,May I just say R.I.P. Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be the best of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,That looks fucking great!
CmRih_VtVAs,"fuckin perfect. fun, creepy, not so serious yet still serious, song lyrics fit the trailer perfect, and geez The Joker! Leto is 10/10 so is Harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So how does this work, we like the bad guys?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,i dont think ive ever seen such beautiful editing and timing in a trailer before.
CmRih_VtVAs,3/10 trailer to many DC characters -screen junkies probably
CmRih_VtVAs,We are bad guys it what we do
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker , you maniaaaaac !"
CmRih_VtVAs,i found deadpools favorite squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,Color me hyped!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""where bad guys. it's what we do"", that sentence pretty much describes Harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,"FInally a good trailer, DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh overrated.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yes it is punk rock ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" in many ways, but DC is doing it in their own style.  We all know the DC has the better villains--and the super stylized approach feels perfectly at home in the DC universe.  More excited for this than Batman V Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hmm.... I was excited about this. Not so much after this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well we had star wars now we have this! Can't wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I honestly can't tell if this will be great or terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,they are gonna realkeies more of these trailer and people gonna say ont spoil but tstill see
CmRih_VtVAs,omg
CmRih_VtVAs,movie is gonna be epic can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"was having second thoughts about watching this because of spoilers. Once i heard bohemian rhapsody, im glad i hit play."
CmRih_VtVAs,So can Margot Robbie wear that harley quinn costume all the time?
CmRih_VtVAs,I love that BR was used for this trailer... I'd probably hate or be surprised of the fact that there will be people who wouldn't know what BR is.... ahhh damn it i'm getting old heh.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow... I was really expecting to hate this movie more than i already hate Batman v. superman. I feel like I really get what they're going for visually and think this might be a pretty kick ass movie o.o
CmRih_VtVAs,Es perfectooooooooooooo!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I give WB credit, they are shifting tones of their movies which I think is fitting. A more serious gritty movie for Batman v Superman and a more fun action thriller with Suicide Squad. Hopefully they keep that up. Flash for example shouldn't be a dark movie when it comes out."
CmRih_VtVAs,that ass though ( referring to harley) :3
CmRih_VtVAs,MARGOT <3!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Woah, this looks fucking next level"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks better than Superman v Batman
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey look it's DC's Guardians of the Galaxy!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Trailer in 2016 so far
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cannot wait to watch this, especially because Will Smith is in it and was filmed in my hometown!"
CmRih_VtVAs,SO MUCH YES!
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh look, its a bog standard trailer, evaluated and overrated by preying on your nostalgia and being entirely carried by a fantastic song, from the 70-90s era, made by a fantastic band that everyone remembers and has no relation to the footage shown in the trailer whatsoever.

oh gee... because we havent seen this cheap manipulating marketing gimmick before right? im sure you all are smart enough to not be suckered in so easily right?.....RIGHT?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith shouldnt be in this, he's too much of a good guy to play a villian"
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm surprisingly ok with this
CmRih_VtVAs,"im sad, they are focusing more on Will Smith in this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Harley's Bronx accent?  Margot Robbie needs to go back to acting school...
CmRih_VtVAs,people please don't judge a movie base off the trailer because people are saying that the trailer has that gotg feel to it (which is not a bad thing)doesn't mean that the actually movie will be like that at all.
CmRih_VtVAs,i <3 when people bitch about DC vs Marvel. Here i am just enjoying all these comic book movies. It's the same with really anything. in warcraft you have retards that yell for the alliance/horde. Here i am playing both. Console vs PC. I play on both. Just reap the rewards m8
CmRih_VtVAs,This feels like a saint row movie
CmRih_VtVAs,my most awaited movie of 2016 with x men
CmRih_VtVAs,sooooo goood!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,11/10 - IGN
CmRih_VtVAs,alguém br aqui
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the direction they took with this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Since when did trailers start advertising films that are 6 months away...
CmRih_VtVAs,"This sets the tone for one badass Batman movie, can you imagine him taking on any of these guys?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody, a song about a young man questioning if something is fantasy or reality, having to explain that they killed someone, and then a descent into hell and so forth. Could this not be a fitting song for the members of the suicide squad dragged down by circumstances and psychosis. Although is the devil the creator of the squad, or the Joker? Also interesting thing I noticed as a gamer, the pink credits at the end of the trailer matches the font used in Harley's psychotic vision in Arkham Knight."
CmRih_VtVAs,*_* yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,will be better than svb
CmRih_VtVAs,SUICIDE GUARDIANS OF THE SQUAD...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie. King Arthur couldn't drag me out!! Serio, til it was shooting air!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"All the marvel fanboys calling this a GOTG ripoff, when the absolute only reasons why it looks the same are these:
-Light-hearted music
-A group of misfits committing good

While here are the reasons it's different:
-Much darker tone
-'Heroes' have no choice in their actions
-It's not a redemption movie, it's a super villain movie
-The trailer song for GOTG showed that the characters were imperfect and misfits, SS shows that they're crazy and unstable.

Also, you can't say the idea of Suicide Squad is a ripoff of GOTG, as the original SS comics came out in 1955, while Gaurdians came out in 69, over a decade later."
CmRih_VtVAs,So it's basically the last two Saints Row games turned into a movie. I'm in.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm wondering what the tone of this movie's going to be. The first trailer was very serious with some pretty disturbing imagery but this is more fun and quorki.
CmRih_VtVAs,That was freaking awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,holy fuck shit balls ass fuck this is gonna be fuckin insane
CmRih_VtVAs,who's watching this trailer 10 times
CmRih_VtVAs,"TOO LATE, MY TIME IS COME, GOODBYE EVERYBODY  <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,*Divided we fall*
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO FUCKING EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,The fucking Joker gives me chills. It's so...ghastly.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a funny suspicion they are fighting The Joker in this one...
CmRih_VtVAs,What is that thing at 1:44 when it's about to be hit by the train it looks like a person
CmRih_VtVAs,Hahahahaaaa I can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Not a fine looking bunch but I seen worse
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer looks amazing. Letos joker seems to eclipse ledgers in everyway. Finally seeing the definitive joker personality. psychotic mad clown. Ledger was NOT the joker. he was nolans joker. This is the DCU joker with tats which is fine because his clothes change often it seems. and I dont mind the tatts as long as we see him wearing his iconic outfits
CmRih_VtVAs,i love it
CmRih_VtVAs,when i saw the first trailer i thought this movie gonna be dark ... after this trailer my thoughts about this movie are way diffrent
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well this movie is going to be... *Insane*...
Haha get it insane cuz they're insane and... *I go cry now*..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is the definition of insanity. And i love it
CmRih_VtVAs,this film better be f#ing epic! cause anything less than epic doesn't deserve to have the bohemian rhapsody as soundtrack of its trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't really care much about this movie but this trailer got me so hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,Girls name?
CmRih_VtVAs,Boy Jared Leto from suicide squad sure looks like Jared Leto from 30 seconds to mars
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLYSHIT !! harley sold me .
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm worried there will be too much CGI.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think later on they'll add Catwoman and poison ivy too..then we'll see the trio with Harley included..although, I've never seen them in the same movie with wonder woman.. Will it be awkward if that happens??I guess nah..Batman is too much of a player to be awkward..he can roll with all of them and will still have time to date talia al ghul.."
CmRih_VtVAs,I see a little silhouetto of a Batman...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Always people hating. I wish more positive people commented. At least we see over 100k people liked it and only 1k didn't. But the comments are filled with stupid fucking kids comparing it to Guardians. Oh my fucking god! Shut up already! The previous trailer is proof of a trailer being able to manipulate the feel the of the movie. We'll wait and see. Seems like it'll be worth my 4,50€."
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh! Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"the best trailer of my life ,the incredible music, fantastic"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Waaaaaaaaaaaay better than Batman V Superman.  I REALLY think I'm going to like this new Joker by Leto too.  Jack Nicholson & Heath Ledger, old & new, combined."
CmRih_VtVAs,killer croc looks stupid
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic.!!
CmRih_VtVAs,song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope not but i think Will Smith will ruin this movie with his intensity faces and his lack of charisma.
CmRih_VtVAs,Mr. Freeze at 2:07 ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn's baseball bat. bad guys
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't know Miley Cyrus is in it?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The best way to end this movie is: ENTER DEATHSTROKE, HOLDING ONE OF THE TRUPS AND SAYING: WALLER I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME, YOU HAVE DIED THE MOMENT YOU TOOK MY SON. or - DON'T SEND YOUR PUPPETS AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU.

And Suicide Squad 2 would be epic even before it starts shooting."
CmRih_VtVAs,Totally awesome stuff. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,that's a long time from now.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Props to whom edited the trailer, it felt natural and make it look interesting :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith going back to his famous role of playing will smith i see.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn and The Others.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cena looks awesome as fuck!
CmRih_VtVAs,génial la musique est superbe les acteurs ont l'air de très bien joué leur rôle le film de l'année.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:45 i got goosebumps all the way from here.
CmRih_VtVAs,Que trailer fudido!!! Um dos melhores que já vi até por causa da sincronia que fizeram junto com uma das melhores músicas do Queen!
CmRih_VtVAs,Still can't get passed Leto's joker...even with how stupid Croc looks.
CmRih_VtVAs,What dumbass said that DC is dark and Marvel for children? What's wrong with you guys? Both universes are somewhere dark and somewhere fun af.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking good :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Leto can take new best joker, seriously that joker look so creepy"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,They give way too much away in movie trailers these days. Isn't ANYTHING left as a surprise anymore?
CmRih_VtVAs,What a great way to start with Bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,CAN'T WAITTT it looks too great !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol cant believe that there is always something wrong for whiners,trailer was awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Really, Really awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so creepy
CmRih_VtVAs,3D is just going to ruin the experience!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I must say, the usage of the song Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen fits in with this film trailer. The song has many different meanings, and this trailer does a good job of setting itself up with one of them. Praise to you Warner Brothers. Praise to you.
         -meh."
CmRih_VtVAs,ok the first Trailer was awesome but this one? wtf y'all thinking? ahahah where is the dark tone? looks like a teen movie to me lel
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait for the film, Cara is amazing 💕"
CmRih_VtVAs,*fan girling*
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE YOU DC!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Who is that?
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that thinks this is generic as shit?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody has been used perfectly!
CmRih_VtVAs,Has no one noticed that the Joker and Harley are in a Lazarus pit
CmRih_VtVAs,"When you look at how they set the mood on the first teaser, it looks like it's a dark film but after this it seems like this movie's going to be funny."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks fun as fuck :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone wanna take a stab at what they're fighting? I'm seeing soldiers with scaly-skin and all that black stuff. Plus that big thing at 1:44 wrapped around someone. All I can think is Uroboros from RE5 lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is this Joker? I thought the whole point of Harley being in the Suicide Squad was because the Joker have been already dead at that point in time following the events of Batman: Arkham City. Then how is he alive again here? Or is it a copy-cat?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jay Courtney LOL, all the movies he plays in are trash"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman What a year what a lovely Year for DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,9 months?  fuck that shit
CmRih_VtVAs,I would much rather spend my $20 on this than most Oscar noms.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this is what you call a good motherfucking trailer, why couldnt they make this one before. Well, better late then never."
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks fun, though the dialogue is awful"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hype is real!
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:08 is hands down the best part of this trailer.... good god! 
but on a real note Leto is giving me goosebumps with his joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Any reason why the villain is a neon Groot Knock off?
CmRih_VtVAs,What the hell did they do to Harley? She's like a completely different character in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Fun. but. Crazy. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Bravo. Hope this film delivers.
CmRih_VtVAs,"oooh,😧..... I think I just peed a little."
CmRih_VtVAs,"yep, curious to see all the restarted comments hating this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,i prefer the other trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,1k butthurt Marvel fans XD this age is of DC now!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"well done WB on making this pile of crap. now I thought in movies u was meant to do acting, yet why is it u ruined Harley Quinn where's the voice, the outfit was already bad enough. so this is basically a blonde chick in hot pants. only good thing about this trailer was the song"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,"This actually looks more fun than Deadpool. and gosh margot Robie, you are hot and gorgeous beyond words, I wish I was mistaa Jay."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Only 5 actors/actresses are getting credits or shown on the title?
This looks fun."
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else went back and see the 1:59 scene is it me or did the trailer already spoiled that harley dies?
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat WALUIGI LAUGH at 1:29
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did.. Did Jai Courtney just steal this trailer? Because it looked like Jai Courtney just stole this trailer. 
Boomerang looks fucking awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"really, WFT?? B. R. by Queen??? WHAT??? EMO smiles and EMO font in the end of trailer...
J E S U S F U C K I N G C H R I S T . i'm done"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:18 - perfect Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks better than batman v superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, please let the movie live up to this amazing trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Very well made trailer...but seriously they give waaaay too much information
CmRih_VtVAs,Eu fali!A cota de filmes desse ano já estourou meu orçamento
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool is better
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm rooting for the bad guys
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is more than amazing!!
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like a disappointment
CmRih_VtVAs,only if it was R... that could be great
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great trailer, shows new content but no real spoilers of the plot. Super excited"
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker looks much younger that Bruce Wayne... He should be older like The Dark Knight Returns
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 WTF
CmRih_VtVAs,I am really excited how jared leto will portray as the joker. but i think the joker would look better with natural teeth.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn : What was that I should kill everyone and escape😂😂😂😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok this fucking made me cry....*applauses*
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm surprised how many people don't know this song
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm here for Margot Robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,Well that looks like fun. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,say what?! i am actualley going to like Jai Courtney in a movie. Damn guess there really is such a thing called new year new me bullshit.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 YES THEY GOT HARLEY QUINNS ORIGIN RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!1
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like it's trying too hard.
CmRih_VtVAs,hate on this movie and katana will take your soul with her cursed sword.  so don't hate
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Nice view of that ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,This gon be sick
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, now that I've seen this trailer I'm genuinely excited for this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,we are the bad guys ...
CmRih_VtVAs,10 year olds are going to love this!
CmRih_VtVAs,IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks so awesome. i can't wait to see it!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this what the kids mean by 'squad goals' because I'm here for this 100%
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm gonna scream if Harley dies at 1:58
CmRih_VtVAs,ok it looks good I'm going to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,Quando passar na tela quente eu assisto
CmRih_VtVAs,Im 89 years old and this looks like a family movie
CmRih_VtVAs,im actually looking forward to this way more than Batman v Superman starring Ben Affleck
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith... As Deadshot... Huh...
CmRih_VtVAs,This is insanely awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,eles sao do bem ou do mal n tendi??
CmRih_VtVAs,The new Joker have big shoes to fill
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks Damn Good♠
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think I like how skanky Harley's outfit is. And I'm a guy.
CmRih_VtVAs,tHE EDITING GOT ME SCREAMING ?!?!?!? amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harleys lines are kinda cringey
CmRih_VtVAs,The only DC´s project of 2016 that look interesting and cool...
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg i can not wait to see this. margot looks like she did a great job doing harley. she is my ultimate favoritie. i cosplay her all the time. i love it love love it. geek freak out. ""the voices"" lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,I loved this trailer the minute Bohemian Rhapsody came on. Definitely one of the best trailers I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,3796332 :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I actually was diggin the jokers laugh! was a lil nervous, but I think leto is pulling it off"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't care that this movie isn't as serious as the first film. Batman VS Superman is a serious and dramatic film, this is a film about bad guys, fighting bad guys. What did you expect? This looks fun as hell!"
CmRih_VtVAs,much more interesting than Batman VS Superman......
CmRih_VtVAs,muthurrrfukkin guuuuuuuudd trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,joker: i can't wait to show you my toys
CmRih_VtVAs,holy molly that blew my mind
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything about this trailer is epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,Take my money now plz!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this was amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone peep the joker laying I t he circle of knifes and guns, shits bouta be lit !"
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck this !  Guns n Roses  is coming back !!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Turkish Coffee?????????
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks really good. I'm excited by the villian in this, looks like some kind of supernatural monster, which will be a lot more fun than just some fellow psycho, something which lets down the Marvel flicks, weak villan's, as much as I love the MCU. I don't agree with David Ayer's take on the appearance of the Squad, but the writing looks very good, and there's no doubting Ayer's talent."
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't let the song distract you from this terrible trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I've watched this 20 times in a row so far
CmRih_VtVAs,What..... you want me to kill everyone and escape. sorry it's the voices....... that's not what they really said
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 - best moment of trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,So hyped!
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet jesus will smith should get an oscar for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:44 inside the train.. kryptonite suit??
Lex??"
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fucking shit I cant stop screaming!!!! This is going to be insane!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC made this second trailer a lot more different than the first one. The first one's gritty while this second one's funny but dark.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys xddddddddddddd
CmRih_VtVAs,If I could inject this movie into my veins... I would.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Most fun part about this is comments 
how people are asking song at the start and song at the end.

People who haven't listened to queen are wondering how the hell is this one song :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so freaking hot.
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing trailer!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,*Where is Deathstroke?*
CmRih_VtVAs,That crazy girl is like Jinx fron LOL.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1)Batman v Superman
2)Deadpool/Suicide squad
3)Civil war
4)Xmen
5)Dr strange
My order for the movies I'm excited the most!
Anyone with the same order?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"All people ever do nowadays is hate on DC for fucking reason. This looks good. So does BvS, how about we accept that and move on."
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY F^^K JOKER IS AMAZING !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hype!
8D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"stop whining about anything the dc does.  The first trailer was dark and serious and now they made a slightly comic one...They're pointing out the schizofrenical, tragicomic characters in the film..WE'RE LOOKING AT THE JOKER! 
THIS TRAILER IS AMAZON PUT TOGETHER WITH THE PREVIOUS ONE. Just everybody shut up and enjoy."
CmRih_VtVAs,is this a hero or villian movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, I changed my mind. This thing could actually be good."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks like it'll be enjoyable.
CmRih_VtVAs,"lots of heat in these comments, damn. To me this is close to perfection and it is allowed to stand alone and be original. Just cuz it might take a spin that differs to the comics or previous adaptions doesn't mean it's gonna be shit. Wait for it to actually be released before deciding that DC have ruined it okay."
CmRih_VtVAs,"guys, can we all pay attention to Joker at 1:57 after he jumps into get Harley, loo at his skin below his head it looks all... weird compared to Harley, could this be the the birth of Harley or something later in the movie.."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks like a damn fine Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Emma Roberts would be perfect as Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,incoming comments saying this movie is for kids and criticising the pg 13 rating
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 Joker looks scary!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,why all this love for harley quinn ??? lol shes a nobody lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Setting aside the feeling that i just now saw the whole movie
i actually will go and see the movie.
Frigging trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect song for this trailer haha
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU MY TOYS !!! XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't see anything, fun, exciting and ground braking that I liked on this trailer EXCEPT, the hot blond girl Margot Robbie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen after this trailer: 9.000.000.00 views
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone else think 1:29 will be jokers last moment in the film?
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the galaxy wannabes...
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks much better than BVS..
CmRih_VtVAs,"Being  movie of villains it looks like it will be the most brightest movie of DC comics in recent times,Can't wait to see it!
Just watching the trailer makes me feel like Margot robbie is born to play Harley quinn!
Totally pumped up!
BTW that was the Best song i have ever heard in a trailer.
Any idea abt the song?anyone?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks much better than BVS..
CmRih_VtVAs,يارب Jared Leto  ميخيبش ظني في الجوكر الجديد 🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,!!!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,that trailer was not that good
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Because this movie looks amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara team >w<
CmRih_VtVAs,so who is suppose to be the antiganist?
CmRih_VtVAs,Would have been cool if they casted the same girl from arrow as katana =/
CmRih_VtVAs,BOOM！！！I wish I can see it in my countryQAQ
CmRih_VtVAs,This will be the grand opening of the year keep this comment
CmRih_VtVAs,BOOM！！！I wish I can see it in my countryQAQ
CmRih_VtVAs,I already like captain boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like Queen's music for this movie :/
CmRih_VtVAs,Preferred the first trailer last year so much more than this one!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The 1st trailer made it seem as though it would be a dark, serious take on the villain characters. Now it looks like they're just going to fuck shit up in a care free matter."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hu3br
CmRih_VtVAs,10 drunk sodas by Courtney out of 10!
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks amazing and the chemicals are in it that is amazing thank you WB and DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,No thank you.
CmRih_VtVAs,QUE TRAILER SENSACIONAL
CmRih_VtVAs,And Will Smith obviously wanted to be on the far Left of the poster...
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks like it's gonna be a ton of fun
CmRih_VtVAs,Can´t wait to see jared letto as marilyn manson !!!! boy he looks loyal...
CmRih_VtVAs,"cant stop watching.
Wish Ledger was alive."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think that Margot Robbie isnt gonna be a good Harley Quinn. 
However. Im really excited to see Jared Leto and Will Smith"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to see Jared Leto and Ben Affleck finally on the same scene. Actually I can. But... eh...  you understand.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen after this trailer: 9.000.000.00 views
CmRih_VtVAs,dam harley quinn got ass
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY PLS
CmRih_VtVAs,You had me at Bohemian Rhapsody!
CmRih_VtVAs,"no matter what them say i still can't wait to this movie, i hope i had the long live till this movie out."
CmRih_VtVAs,They could have thrown in a batman in the trailer just to show it was a DC movies more clearly to audiences. But all in all a great trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,#MERCURY_SQUAD
CmRih_VtVAs,The only thing I don't like about this movie so far is The portrayal of Harley Quinn. yes theirs the voice not being a Boston accent but I don't feel she's been portrayed as spastic and over the top as she is in the comics.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, I guess they decided to be more like Deadpool than Batman V Superman..... Looks good, but seriously, Deadpool influenced this trailer so much!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think the accent is something we may get hints of only when shes with the joker. its going to be a good movie regardless. its done sooo no use complaining. just enjoy the ride ppl. Besides jared leto's joker is going to be quite entertaining.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anoyne else had a smile on theit faces while and after watching this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,this is f.....ing amazing... ohh trailer to...
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the Best trailer in the Comic world.. DC is going to reclaim the crown with worst Heroes
CmRih_VtVAs,"People just love hating on things for no reason what so ever. They gave us a trailer that is unexpected, with a song that shouldn't work for a trailer but actually did ( not like Star Trek with sabotage).I'm hyped for the movie , but until it's out , the hate should be kept to a minimum."
CmRih_VtVAs,the one i like the most is the panda with the machine gun
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 Joker body made of Plant/Bark? Swamp-Thing?
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPEE
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this movie looks terrible....
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so awesome. I'm so excited for this film!
CmRih_VtVAs,ahhhhh A year for great superhero movies! Especially excited for these DC films!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hail Margot Robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,This really awesome and fantastical... I'm really looking forward to the premiere!!! Primiere IS VERY SOON!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Una copia a los guardianes de la galaxia.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the tone that they are setting for that movie. For now i'm full team Harley Quinn. Then i'm still kind of sceptic for this impersonation of the Joker but maybe they'll prove me wrong ! Can't wait for all the DC deliciousness !
CmRih_VtVAs,god i cant wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"After watching all these DC trailers I'm convinced that no one working on these films can write dialog that isn't involuntarily cringeworthy. It could all be a red herring, but I don't have much hope."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks really promising
CmRih_VtVAs,nick cage?
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is very well rounded and nice love how the plot is introduced in the beginning with the steadyness of the song and the action picks up when the song picks up.... It's a fun trailer the cinematography looks really nice the acting looks decent and I'm excited I love how they aren't telling who the big bad is which is funny cause it's full of bad guys this movie is the type that makes you think who's the real bad guys in comics I have a feeling it's more of a character film than action which is kinda good since there is so many dynamic actors
CmRih_VtVAs,"the song kills the trailer for me and ""worst heros ever"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"waaa!! Queen, definitivamente me ganaron con eso"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody  
The same group who did the Highlander theme song."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow...people will fanboy over any shit game or movie now a days if it has comic book characters in it. No matter how unoriginal it maybe. It's so easy to impress people. smh
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow...people will fanboy over any shit game or movie now a days if it has comic book characters in it. No matter how unoriginal it maybe. It's so easy to impress people. smh
CmRih_VtVAs,it's like hot topic got its own movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I think i just found the sound of defusing a bomb in Call Of Duty 4 at 2:09
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok. Well it looks different. These days my standards for movies are fairly high I will admit. So to me the first thing is always does it look like other forgettable crap that I shouldnt waste time on, or, does it have its own lane. None of us knows if the MOVIE is great but it looks a bit unique. They are just trailers but I will tell you this, I hated The Fan4tic Four trailer and it seems I dodged that bullet so sometimes you can tell when something is shit (with all do respect to that cast which I like). This will get the benefit of the doubt for now. And we can always SAVAGELY rip it apart later. We're the Internet!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great music and montage.
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome trailer!! So excited about this movie! Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn a** kicking  trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't know Alex mercer was the villain
CmRih_VtVAs,"didnt like it :/ ...it that was the joker,is a terrible joker...deadshot looks strange...not the best actors...worst song to put in a trailer like this...low expectations for this :S"
CmRih_VtVAs,soundtrack is amazing !
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 let's fap guys
CmRih_VtVAs,PG-13
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Deadshot and Joker have an encounter.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone notice that all of the jokes suck.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The premise for this movie was ""Let's do something like Guardians of the Galaxy but in a way it sucks""."
CmRih_VtVAs,Struggling to breathe over here
CmRih_VtVAs,"the first trailer didn't hyped much as this one, now, I'm more excited for this than the always Batman/Superman saga, it's getting boring, I'm excited for BVS and Civil War, but, we've seen enough of Batman, Superman and Avengers in previous movies...Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange..those are some good fresh new things!! it's unfair that most people always keep forgetting that both Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange are coming out this year and both of the movies are always overshadowed by BVS and Civil War, fuck those shits for a while, let's have some moment and appreciate that we'll see these awesome newcomers in superhero genre."
CmRih_VtVAs,Não consigo parar de ver <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"The word ""devil"" can be heard in the two trailers of batman vs superman and the first of suicide, and in this one too."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks so lame. too hipster tryhard for my liking. oh well!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anything looks cool with that song (btw, Im not saying it isn't cool)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol the movie is so generic but the guy who did the trailer is a genius. Well Freddy is a genius. Leto Joker looks fun though
CmRih_VtVAs,Minus the metal teeth and tattoos this joker is pretty close to the comic's joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Amazing
DAT ASS"
CmRih_VtVAs,They should release a video game of this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,flash has the best dc storyline joker the best villian    another batman movie atleast this one film in tdot
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know what to think about this...
CmRih_VtVAs,Awwwwh yeah. Bohemian Rhapsody!! XD ❤
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype is real guys!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 you're welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,Love this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,The soundtrack to La bohème would have worked better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"fuck BvS and CW, this is what really matters and skullpoopl"
CmRih_VtVAs,Movie gonna flop
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is literally saying ""Why so serious?"" to all BvS trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,why is jinx there?
CmRih_VtVAs,1800 down votes from Marvel fanboys that are scared now that the big boys have come to the table.  DC is about to make the Marvel universe look like Sesame Street.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 GAD DAMYUM da ass!
CmRih_VtVAs,dc got the best villains
CmRih_VtVAs,Ain é muita coisa pro meu coração... Eu não vou aguentar ... Quero ver esse filme logooooooooo
CmRih_VtVAs,Hola >:V
CmRih_VtVAs,i was expecting more...
CmRih_VtVAs,What is that thing in the subway?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish killer croc would look bigger but he still looks badass
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm in love! Dare you if the movie is crap... Then the world will burn *creepy_laugh* ;-P
CmRih_VtVAs,редкая хуита
CmRih_VtVAs,Very good trailer. Especially 2:07 grabbed my attention. Incredible visuals.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer was awesome. I don't have a problem with Will Smith as Deadshot, but I don't really enjoy those early 2000's Will Smith one-liners"
CmRih_VtVAs,Esquadrão Thug Life
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 nice view
CmRih_VtVAs,"Song in trailer: 
Darude - Sandstorm"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait this!!! Omg!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks better than any cheesy Marvel film ever made.
CmRih_VtVAs,:D
CmRih_VtVAs,I just had an eargasm and an eyegasm at the same time.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 - 2:08 Someone please make a gif
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks fun now. Earlier it just seemed so bland and dull. THIS is a film I could see.
CmRih_VtVAs,:D
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody + Suicide Attack= Mind Fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Spoiler Alert .

John Cena !!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,See how many places you can easily recognize as Toronto. The subway scene is obviously Lower Bay Station and that's a Bombardier T1 train.
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPED
CmRih_VtVAs,"All of my doubts are gone.

So freaking hyped!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Continuity error at 2:04 ... The soldier
CmRih_VtVAs,"oooh man this is so cool, batman vs superman can suck it"
CmRih_VtVAs,trailer is shit
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that it is a movie about super villains makes me more excited for this than Batman v Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this? FUN!? IN A DC MOVIE!? How is it possible!?
CmRih_VtVAs,wow!!!  sandstorm by darude really fits as a song this trailer!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I cant wait to show you my toys"" just awesome ★"
CmRih_VtVAs,"who ever is here to criticize, go somewhere else. This trailer was epic. A movie can't please everybody so be happy there not in a low budget power ranger costume. it'll be good and in the back of your mind u like it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank you Steven Price for choosing this fucking awesome song!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is there anything better than Queen and Suicide Squad together ?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is F Awesome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"lololol does margot robbie ever act in a movie where she isn't an on screen prostitute??

Was so looking forward to this film. A fantastic concept.
Gotta stop getting excited over modern hollywood garbage.  
Can't get over this horrible casting.

But Will Smith better automatically win an award for this- otherwise we are all racist assholes."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't why Margot didn't just use the voice from Wolf of Wall Street. She actually sounded like Harley far more in that! But there we go, have to see how this pans out."
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is either going to be the best cheesy superhero movie ever, or the worst superhero movie ever"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ehh.
Looks alright. Will probably appeal more to hardcore DC fans than me."
CmRih_VtVAs,SOLD!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey I don't know much about these guys but what are they after? I know they're bad guys so are the hunting down the joker or trying to recruit him or sonething
CmRih_VtVAs,"you know something wrong when your favorite part of a trailer is Jai Courtney, overall OK but I miss Harley accent"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 someone?
CmRih_VtVAs,is this like guardians of the galaxy or sth?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Isn't it fucking amazing? I was so skeptical to Jared Leto, but now i see he is so awesome. The scene with chemicals and knife.Jesus, it so good. How can I wait so long?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"why is everyone so mad? I thought the trailer was pretty good, guess you just can't please people these days"
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,CA-RA-LHO!
CmRih_VtVAs,I rate this 5/7.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wAittttttttt
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh harley :D this is gonna be fun
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley hype <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, Jai Courtney's acting seems good?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It doesn't look good, same goes for Batman Vs Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,"My guess is. We know the Batman is in this movie. And we know he goes in retirement after this movie and before atman v Superman. The fact that both the Batman and the antagonist that the Suicide Squad is tasked to eliminate suggest to me that Amanda Waller hired them to take the Batman down. In the comics and animated series Amanda Waller is openly against the Batman, Superman and the whole Justice League and until a major showdown against a fused Luthor-Brainiac monster, she is doing everything in her power to discredit and destroy them. Add to the mix the tone they address the Batman in the Batman v Superman movie trailer as a ""vigilante"", I am on 85%, that the Suicide Squad is going up against the Batman."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn looks awesome here!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC is dope, Marvel is shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,Definitely not as good as the Batman vs Superman or Captain America 3 trailers but it should still be fun
CmRih_VtVAs,2:31 babyface and orb spotted
CmRih_VtVAs,It really just looks like this is just dc's attempt to have their own guardians of the galaxy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn... Jared took a direct quote from ""She"".... ""I can't wait to show you my toys"""
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love it! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,In all honesty I don't really mind the lose of her accent. Considering all the massive changes people have done to the original Harley this isn't that bad. Personally I'm excited to see how this movie plays out. I will remain optimistic
CmRih_VtVAs,5:00 hold up angry grandpa !? lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm disappointed that I didn't hear Harley's accent at all. She sounds really... average. It's odd to me.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 is the place to be
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have this sick feeling that it's gonna be really campy and reminiscent of Speed Racer and a lot of people aren't going to like it.. It's doomed to be one of the most underrated movies of our generation. In a way I don't want it to come out, but that's just me."
CmRih_VtVAs,Needs more Batman 
CmRih_VtVAs,This makes sense people keep saying oh man they are rushing it Warner Bros need to chill. Lets be real if they did the same exact thing as marvel did with solo solo solo then team up movie. They would never get out from marvels shadow. Thats why they are doing batman v superman. They want everybody attention. And to get thier attention you gotta make some crazy plays. And sucide squad coming after bvs also makes sense. You would expect the third movie in the DCEU to be wonder woman but no they  throw everybody off thier game. And gives us sucide squad. Its all about trying to get ahead of marvel. And you cant do that by following thier formula.
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy crap i'm getting so fucking excited for this movie even though i know i shouldnt fall for the hype
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wish deadshot  felt more deadshot , it kinda feels like will smith in a deadshot costume"
CmRih_VtVAs,"My God, Harley Quinn so great, i think I'm in love..."
CmRih_VtVAs,GET ON THE HYPE TRAIN!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who could fucking dislike this?!?!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Even if it doesn't look that good I'm still going to see it. I'm getting kind of sick of just seeing Marvel characters on the big screen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,My body is ready....
CmRih_VtVAs,Scott Eastwood?
CmRih_VtVAs,FINALLY A DC MOVIE THAT ISN'T TRYING TO BE DARK AND BROODING I'M PUMPED
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a bit curious about the strange figure that was standing directly in front of it annihilated that train (1:44). Looked similiar to when Joker and presumably Harley are rising out of the weird chemical pool (1:59). Any thoughts?
CmRih_VtVAs,missin' heath ledger..😭
CmRih_VtVAs,"honestly, you don't have to be a die hard fan to see that the quality of this movie is top notch. whether this pumps you up or you bitch about it, this movie is going to be great. Idk fuck it. yeeee"
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK, just did some research, and I think the thing at 1:44 is either the tattooed man(who is being played by Common) or its a monster created by Enchantress who seems to be an antagonist of the Suicide Squad to some extent. I mean we never actually see her with the team, and i'm pretty sure the faceless men we see everyone fighting were made by her. Now the question is are The Joker, Enchantress, and Tattooed man all working together?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks fucking fun as hell
I'm totally more excited for this than Dawn of Justice"
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is 10/10!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Man Jared Leto looks awesome as Jason Todd!
CmRih_VtVAs,the only complaint that i have is that they showed that harley quinn dies
CmRih_VtVAs,really? bohemian rhapsody for this trailer? really?
CmRih_VtVAs,QUICK SOMEONE TWEET JEREMY JAHNS
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh hell yea he does
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen! Whoop whoop
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is Jai Courtney blowing to get in these films?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dont really care is she has the boston twang (even though I still think itd be great) but Harley doesn't really seem bubbly enough. She's almost sedated and sarcastic instead of excited about everything. Which was what made it badass when she started kicking the shit out of people. The voice gives her a child-like demeanor that was both creepy when the joker stepped in, and fun when shit hit the fan. I don't know...I don't think I can really enjoy it if she is just going to be sauntering around all smooth and not bouncing off the walls."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm having my doubts about this but let's see
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the song title? Catchy one :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie cheerfully going ""Whoaaa!"" makes me chuckle every time.

And Jai Courtney looks like he's going to do some interesting acting in a film for once.  I don't hate the guy, but he's always come off bland as can be."
CmRih_VtVAs,6/10
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, a movie trailer that uses Queen's song Bohemian Rhapsody is defiantly worth seeing! I can't wait to see this movie :D Forget Captain America and Dawn of Justice, Deadpool and Suicide Squad is where its at :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, let's see this trailer, but I don't expect too much... 
*Bohemian Rhapsody kicks in*
I'M THROWING MY MONEY TO THE SCREEN!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Messa can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Really liking the look of this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody isn't a BAD song, per se, but it felt a little too on-the-nose, in my opinion. You know a song I'd like to hear playing in a Suicide Squad trailer? Something really chill, like maybe a Toh Kay acoustic piece. Something that contrasts in an uncomfortable way with the violence and madness on-screen, making it seem disturbing and surreal, instead of an energetic song like this that seems to glorify it, as it were."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dayum I'm a trillion times more excited for this than BvS! And SHIT did they cast a great Harley!
CmRih_VtVAs,the song give a major bust
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 shit is that slipknot?
CmRih_VtVAs,perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Insaneeeeeee
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just pause at 2:07 and you will be happy 
Quite a view"
CmRih_VtVAs,music is bad
CmRih_VtVAs,"So looking forward to this movie (after Deadpool)!
Is it just me or does Joker really kinda look like Marilyn Manson?"
CmRih_VtVAs,i wanna see batman in these trailers just as much as i want to see spiderman in civil war trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,Please be RatedR
CmRih_VtVAs,Where the hell is Batman?!
CmRih_VtVAs,god damn teal and orange colour grading! fuck you!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks AMAZING!
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant i want to think the movie will be good but i have this nagging feeling
CmRih_VtVAs,Wanjeeeeeeeng!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like DC learned from their BvS lesson about giving away too much in a trailer. I'm actually excited about this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well can't please them all, i still look forward to seeing this!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, this looks so bad that it kind of made me hate Queen a bit."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, I say, everything looks perfect.
From the visuals to the casting, Heck even the logo and font used in this trailer looks sick!
So gonna watch this movie <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why did they silence the ""Bismillah"" part of the song?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Toronto... all i see is Toronto
CmRih_VtVAs,August?
CmRih_VtVAs,Now I'm looking forward to this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,A part of this trailer i really love that many people probably just glossed over was 1:49 and how perfectly synced the bullet shells falling was with the music. There are actually quit a few great moments like that in the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Great song. Unfortunately it doesn't really work well with this trailer....
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best trailer i've ever seen. This is perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,That music was terrible.  I couldn't watch any longer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"There were portions i couldn't watch because i was headbanging.

Thanks, Wayne's World, for making the world go up and down everytime i listen to this song."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:03 was daedshot the flash or something!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Could it be? A trailer without the Inception horn? How I am supposed to know that I should watch the movie if there's no ""BWAAAAAAAAAM"" every 5 seconds?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I've not been this excited for a DC movie in quite some time.  Lets hope it lives up to the hype!
CmRih_VtVAs,Watching this for the 10th time today..
CmRih_VtVAs,"""The trailer is soooo Grim and Dark! Boo! It's gonna suck!""
""The trailer is so childish and with no plotline seen! Bleh! They should make serious trailers!""

Basically how the fanboyism and trailers work. I will be honest: I liked the first one better. But the second one shows the other side of Suicide Squad. They are not just criminals. They are maniacs! They are criminally insane weapons! 
Why the whole hate? Isn't it utterly stupid to judge the movie by its trailer?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Esse filme vai ser foda!
CmRih_VtVAs,?But why Deadshot is black
CmRih_VtVAs,sold!
CmRih_VtVAs,HATE CARA DELIVIGNE! Ruined the movie for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,i liked it all except for the 'worst heroes ever' that just felt cringe
CmRih_VtVAs,cant lie everyone looks badass. why isnt the enchantress in the thumbnail
CmRih_VtVAs,Nope
CmRih_VtVAs,Miss Jar Jar Binns
CmRih_VtVAs,better than misleading batman vs superman movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate people. They are hating but this movie looks incredible?

CmRih_VtVAs,"oh ,that butt"
CmRih_VtVAs,they had me at queen
CmRih_VtVAs,Overrated song for a lame looking movie. Harley Quinn is over played and I feel like this long trailer is a desperate reach for attention.

CmRih_VtVAs,sooo amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,what song? :3
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP heath ledger 😢
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Cinecomics trailer EVER

CmRih_VtVAs,a du
CmRih_VtVAs,wow I actually look forward to this movie now somehow
CmRih_VtVAs,More excited for the Suicide Squad than Superman Vs Batman now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Sold.   *throws money at ticket counter*   I want to nibble on Harley for a few days.  <3
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so attracted to the crazy blond.  My penis homes in on crazy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is so cringe worthy. Her voice just doesn't match. She also acts like she's trying way to hard to be like Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,"damn, that's so hot...
can't wait to wacth
""WE ARE BAD GUY THAT'S WHAT WE DO"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"This was a good trailer, but I'm not sold at all on this movie. Joker and Harley especially look as if they're being forced way too hard."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared leto's joker:

Jack Nicholson's comic to screen look (but not really I guess)+Heath ledger's psychopath mentality"
CmRih_VtVAs,What song is this ?
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith cant do bad ass...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally a movie w/o superheros.
Badguys to heros has been done many times but movie looks good, Queen got my attention tho."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay
Now I'll go see it
This is a really good trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,ссанина какая то
CmRih_VtVAs,"1 problem. Bohemian Rhapsody? Really? Are they all having their Coming-Out in this movie? Cause if not, then you chose the wrong song..."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:10 She remind me of Anne Hathaway.. lol
CmRih_VtVAs,okay this looks great please don't disappoint
CmRih_VtVAs,Funny how a movie about villains looks fun   whereas Batman v Superman just looks dark and boring.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like they didnt show that Batman is in the movie this time.....the hype is big enough without him
CmRih_VtVAs,Name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,damn it's like watching a wrecked circus! *I LIKE IT*
CmRih_VtVAs,I first thought the queen song in background was playing some where else. 5 mins wasted pausing it.
CmRih_VtVAs,made my day. This looks like is going to be the best movie of 2016.
CmRih_VtVAs,Which are the songs! The first ones Rhapsody right?
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie easily can become best comic film just after dark knight both trailers look awesome and its compeletly new story and new thing that never happend in comic movies and we have to admit both joker and harley look awesome 
cant wait for this"
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok, I gotta admit, its looking a lot better now. a lot more fun. I like it"
CmRih_VtVAs,end part. love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one that thinks the movie and cast looks absolutely fucking shit?
CmRih_VtVAs,Too much Quinn ? ...looks like she's leading this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,will smith playing a villain? What?
CmRih_VtVAs,why bohemian rhapsody just why
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my favorite trailer of all time. I'm sorry it's just so PERFECT. I want to see this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,why bohemian rhapsody just why
CmRih_VtVAs,That was beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,And the Hunt for Bohemian Rhapsody has now begun....
CmRih_VtVAs,We're bad guys It's what we do -Best Line 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,once again i feel like i've seen 80% of the movie through trailers...
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I'm more excited in bvs than this
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst song for a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,What if the joker in this movie is Jason Todd and the suicide squad if tasked to take him out because he isn't the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer was fucking incredible! The tone of it, the look of it, everything was just perfect. Jared Leto looks so fucking sick as The Joker, Margot Robbie has nailed Harley Quinn (apart from the accent obviously), Will Smith looks amazing as Deadshot, hell, even Jai Courtney looks awesome! This film has the potential to be out of this world, August 5th can't come quick enough!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley sucks in this trailer. Not as charismatic as the cartoon character.
CmRih_VtVAs,Pause @ 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody made this trailer all the better
CmRih_VtVAs,now to wait for a mr sunday movies trailer break down
CmRih_VtVAs,"Awesome that they included a bit more captain boomerang there, cause he is my favourite character :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,@drawingafterSIX Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm really unsure what the theme of the movie is gonna be... The teaser trailer was slow, tragic and twisted, whereas this one's fast, funny and insane. Either way, will be keen to watch"
CmRih_VtVAs,awsome
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow, the cola, harley, joker scene, i can't wait for this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Here is everyone is - hyped as F about deadpool whereas this movie looks clearly better to me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Kovic?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks amazing, day one for sure...and I don't even know the comics."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cadê os BR?
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy f word
CmRih_VtVAs,i still don't like the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whoa, a complete change in tone yet again. DC should just make one trailer and stick with it. Just like how Bvs comic con trailer was amazing and the next one was complete shit, this one is complete shit too. 
P.S: Bohemian Rhapsody is certainly NOT deserving of this treatment. No one can touch that masterpiece. Much less put it in a goddamn trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,I came so hard. Thank you DC!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Get working Mr Sunday Movies!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like they're fighting Alex Mercer.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 What's that Residents eye ball helmet doing there?...
CmRih_VtVAs,Leko as Joker will forever be a NOPE for me. Sorry.
CmRih_VtVAs,"seriously what the H@$! what wrong with you or she people ! Quinn say , we are bad guy this what we do"
CmRih_VtVAs,is that swamp thing???
CmRih_VtVAs,It's not a good sign that every other superhero movie trailer looks way better than Batman vs Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm excited for this, but I imagine the studio is pushing for a pg-13 /12a rating. It'd be so much better if it were to be a 15/r rated film, it'd give David Ayer the freedom to kick the violence and dialogue up a notch. Nevertheless it still looks amazing"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith will die in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg this is the best thing I've ever seen trailer wise it's going to be a beautiful twisted work of art.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer so far this year. Def gonna see this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think the story of this, since Joker is the only one who's not imprisoned, he started a big crime or war in a city so the government will ask help for his imprisoned squad so eventually they can be freed"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not sold on the portrail of harley quinn... the rest looks fine.
CmRih_VtVAs,Meeeh! Bohemian Rhapsody all the way! #FreddieStillLives
CmRih_VtVAs,This is beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,"i thuink it might follow the suicide movie from the dc animated series, it looks like it"
CmRih_VtVAs,that isss sicckk
CmRih_VtVAs,jarde leto's laugh is very different hahaha!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"So The Joker became The Joker by accidentaly falling into acid, and it seems like he throws Harleen Quinzel into the acid to turn her into Harley Quinn. NICE! I wish we could have The Killing Joke movie from the comics as a part of the DCEU. They're doing an animated movie but tho."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is exactly how a trailer should go down. Gives some glimpses of the storyline, characters, but doesn't reveal the entire plot for us to then say 'watched the whole movie in 3 minutes'. I also love how excited they get us, really looks like this stuff can go down for oscars. Everything is so on point and in sync."
CmRih_VtVAs,"BRUTAL, increible.. very well."
CmRih_VtVAs,I miss Harley Quinn's Boston accent
CmRih_VtVAs,What a waste of a great song.
CmRih_VtVAs,The bohemian rhapsody is what gets me here
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg!!! Looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"""we're bad guys, it's what we do"" that made me laugh lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Plot twist, Zod i alive and he will join the bad guys :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,The editor who made this trailer is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Had to pause as I thought it was a fan made trailer with that song. Preferred the comic-con teaser and song. 
Still looking forward to it though."
CmRih_VtVAs,Big dc fan and still gonna catch the movie but not really feeling the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Incredible trailer, Incredible song. I think this movie will kick other dc/marvel movies nuts"
CmRih_VtVAs,probably one of the best movie trailers ever
CmRih_VtVAs,shittiest joker ever
CmRih_VtVAs,i hope it won't anymore queen music in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,It's going to be the best movie ever!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Taking cues from Guardians of the Galaxy, huh?
I like this trailer so much."
CmRih_VtVAs,there is just one problem with this film. The two actors who play joker and harley quinn are fucking terrible!
CmRih_VtVAs,i have not been a DC movie fan since the old batman movies never liked the dark knight trilogy that much but this movie i can not wait to see it looks so amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Ok, that is UNFAIR to use Bohemian Rhapsody in the trailer!  I can't NOT like it now >:/*"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck batman v superman. I know i can see both but fuck it. This trailer sold me. Everyone's batshit crazy and the cgi is great.Most importantly the trailer doesn't have new shitty music. I think this bohemian rhapsody's perhaps remixed but still eons better than some new bullshit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Way more excited for this than Batman v. Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"now this is a fucking trailer, fucking amaizing"
CmRih_VtVAs,@ 1:30 you could see the skulls in the spirit of Katana's sword......Katana is gonna be one badass biatch
CmRih_VtVAs,CADÊ OS HUEBR?
CmRih_VtVAs,I  can't wait anymore
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, awesome trailer !!!

Song ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks great!  I can't wait to see Guardians of th, uh...I mean Suicide Squad."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lol. they cut the ""Bismillah"" (in the name of Allah)  part of the song"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie nails it...
CmRih_VtVAs,This is awesome! And the song! BOHEMY RAPSODY-QUEEN!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know if anyone else has commented about this, but I have to........WHERES HARLEY'S ACCENT!?!? I'm sorry, that damn near kills it for me. Call me petty, but Harley just isn't Harley without the accent."
CmRih_VtVAs,Poison ivy 1:52
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen makes everything a thousand times better doesn't it?
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer was awesome sadly it had the vibe of the second die hard 5 trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love that line when he's saying their atributes/powers and when it comes to Harley ""she's just crazy"" Like she hasn't any purpose in this squad whatsoever only to be ""funny girl hee-hee"" -_-"
CmRih_VtVAs,"why, oh lord WHY did they have to sexualise Harley Quinn? i seriously hope this movie bombs"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer is set to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".
This is fucking brilliant. 
Seriously, whoever thought of that is a genius because that looked/sounded AWESOME."
CmRih_VtVAs,Have feminists gone apeshit over Harley yet?
CmRih_VtVAs,Somehow i have that feeling that Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman could be dissapointments
CmRih_VtVAs,Just realize what HQ is a fem version of the Deadpool. And she looks better.
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the song at the start? ( I Know the song but roast me anyways)
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is incredible !
CmRih_VtVAs,"excellent trailer, epic tune........cant bloody wait !"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Property of Joker"" on Harley's jacket, lol.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still not as cool as deadpool 
X gon' give it to ya"
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks pretty cool but i like the ""other"" first trailer better."
CmRih_VtVAs,You had me at Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"God, Harley is so annoying already"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg I can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer... is FCKING EPIC!
Great job on composing!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:06 ”Si vis pacem, para bellum” i am more amazed i watched the t-shirt and not her ass"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this!!!!! I know I will enjoy this movie....
CmRih_VtVAs,is that Emma Watson at 1:53?
CmRih_VtVAs,""" What was that? I should kill everyone and escape? "" - Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,This is sooo Guardians of the Galaxy...
CmRih_VtVAs,perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,There should be a law against using Bohemian Rhapsody to push your lame 90s throwback comic book movie
CmRih_VtVAs,when the gun shots time in with the song you know its gonna be a good movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck Batman v Superman this is the DC movie I wanted
CmRih_VtVAs,When did everybody on the internet become movie critics?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be hilarious
CmRih_VtVAs,Likable Deadshot. Who woulda thought that? :o
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg! Finally it came out. Can't wait for the show.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dayuuuuum this gon be gud
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol Queen is overused
CmRih_VtVAs,This is a beautiful video
CmRih_VtVAs,The fact that NO Batman is seen nor heard in this trailer gives it many a thumbs up.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching this trailer. It's so good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen really amp the hype!
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie as Harley is a dream that came true..!!
CmRih_VtVAs,DEEEZ NUUTZ!! HA HA HA
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looking pretty awesome in my opinion
CmRih_VtVAs,might just be me feeling this but I just don't feel the dc cinematic universe has been established enough for this movie. I mean we haven't even had a batman solo movie for this universe yet and killer kroc and joker are still just gonna be tossed in. I don't like it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm assuming they're going against poison ivy, which begs the question, who is playing her?"
CmRih_VtVAs,that ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie SUCKS Amanda Seyfried would've been a better Harley Quinn but she either turned it down or didn't get the role cuz she was considered.
CmRih_VtVAs,"garbage fucking trailer for a garbage fucking movie....not only does that srry excuse of a ""Harley"" look like shit...sounds like shit too...what happened to the ""Harley"" accent...what a piece of shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,Boring.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 Scott Eastwood Fist Bump
CmRih_VtVAs,His Joker laugh is spot on.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So to play the joker from now on, instead of simply being a good actor you have to pretend you went insane like people think happened to Heath?

That sucks.

Should make a batman beyond movie with mark hamil as old joker and adam west as old batman, would be incredible and none of this actors so dedicated = ""I am the real life version of this comic character i swear!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who knew and love Bohemian Rhapsody before this trailer? Best song choice for this trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,the hype is sailed
CmRih_VtVAs,Look at the like and dislike ratio...
CmRih_VtVAs,This is literally the most awesome thing I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this going to be fun :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Seems like an awesome movie unlike the abomination Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:26 ""let's do something fun"" - hell yes as long as it doesn't involve awful acting"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Somebody refresh my memory, the Suicide Squad is made up of Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Deadshot, and who?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman vs Superman's overexposed lame-assness? NO THANKS. I'm on board Suicide Squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,1k marvel fanboys detected
CmRih_VtVAs,WOOOOOOO!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hope Captain Boomerang doesn't suck though looks like Joker, Harley and Deadshot are the only leads."
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,crazy time to be alive
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy cow the CGI looks so real! I can't wait :D
CmRih_VtVAs,aaaahhh joyssss
CmRih_VtVAs,"the use of the Bohemian rhapsody made this trailer 12x as much fun as it already was, not to mention the stealth drink at 1:35. That's what I would do in a shootout! But, in all seriousness 10/10 can't wait."
CmRih_VtVAs,"They had me at ""is this the rea life..."""
CmRih_VtVAs,1:27 Yes Joker Laugh!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Guys GUUUUUUUYS i literally screamed when i saw the Joker and Harley Queen OH MY GOD !!! Hiiiiiiiiiiiihaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie looks good in it, but it would be better if Emma Roberts plays instead of her."
CmRih_VtVAs,0:08 turkish coffe ? :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker still looks like shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, I wish Harley had her Boston accent, it's kinda hard to in vision Harley without one."
CmRih_VtVAs,harley's ASS though
CmRih_VtVAs,hit like if you can't wait until august 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Poison Ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the worst trailers I've ever seen....Jared my friend you will never surpass the legend of Heath Ledger....Did you hear me NEVER!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't see any whiny DC fanboy with Civil War Trailer because of the serious tone. I see a lot of whiny Marvel fanboy with this trailer because of the humorous tone. I love both Marvel and DC but the fanboys are pathetic
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see Harley and mista j together!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad entering Marvel Studios and destroying phase 3! Can't wait for that scene!
CmRih_VtVAs,1628 are Marvel fans
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the way they explain Harley's hair in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST. EDITED. TRAILER. EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,algum br
CmRih_VtVAs,"A little disappointed on the Harley accent but Margot is gonna be amazing, also Jared is gonna be memorable with his joker😄"
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker gave me goosebumps in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i hope it's gonna be good, but i can't help but feel it's gonna be shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
CmRih_VtVAs,DC IS THE BEST
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is actually happening, its for real, mindblown, first Deadpool, no Harley and the squad, Civil War and BvS, what a year to be a Comic Book fan!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"august 5th? thats quite a wait, also why do videos you really want to watch take forever to buffer?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"That scene where Joker swan dives into the pit is pure awesome. The Joker just doesn't give a f**k, and that demonstrates his attitude perfectly. And he seems to be doing it for Harley, which even makes it touching."
CmRih_VtVAs,"50% cliche, 50% batman stuff"
CmRih_VtVAs,you like this trailer! ADMIT IT!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The song made it more awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,PUTA QUE PARIU
CmRih_VtVAs,"Amazing trailer!! The MUSIC WAS AMAZING!!!! I love Queen! 
Also, Harley Quinn is really gonna make this movie. We all love Margot Robbie. She's so hot!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is worse than the first.

Don't get me wrong I love Queen but the music is so out of place here. 

I started a Joke was sung so amazingly last trailer it had a very haunting creepy atmosphere to it. 

Here I feel like I am listening to something that should be advertising a circus"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my New toys"" 
Silent Hills Confirmed."
CmRih_VtVAs,I suppose Will Smith will want an Oscar for this?
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks dope as hell
CmRih_VtVAs,*Can't wait for the movie*
CmRih_VtVAs,did anybody else see Scott Eastwood
CmRih_VtVAs,This is LEGEN... wait for it... DARYYYYYYYYY!
CmRih_VtVAs,Kinnaman looks like he's on drugs.
CmRih_VtVAs,this... this feels so right!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best trailer ever!
Bohemian Rapsody and a crazy movie. Can't get much better than this."
CmRih_VtVAs,esse filme vai ser foda
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad? more like ""Not spacial Guardians of the Galaxy :V"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"In an alternate universe, this movie will be rated R."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is one of the sweetest badass queen in history
CmRih_VtVAs,Why will smith.... Terrible choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow... this is perfect trailer!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:54 holy shit. didn't knew that Scott Eastwood (Clint Eastwood's son) was in the film.
CmRih_VtVAs,i love harley <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the one sneaking a beer?
CmRih_VtVAs,Only watched the trailer because of the song ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,August 2016??......................really? i have to survive till then?
CmRih_VtVAs,I like Pink Floyd they have nice music in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 What the hell is that? Is that an OMAC?
CmRih_VtVAs,is there something wrong with me if i think this looks really stupid?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Interesting choice of music, it's Queen Bohemian Rhapsody by the way."
CmRih_VtVAs,"despite the fact that this movie is amazing, no one can replace the true joker Heath Ledger (R.I.P)"
CmRih_VtVAs,whats 1:43?  mutant?
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder would it have nearly the same effect if there was no background music.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cacetada!!! 👏🏻👏🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,C'mrn. Looks sice. follow quilt What's your opinion about !
CmRih_VtVAs,"Awesome trailer. But if someone here asks for the name of the song, KILL HIM!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok, we all get it - you want to convince kids that iving in a prison state is great fun.  And being a criminal is the best career. In fact the logic represented by this movie is the logic by which US soldiers are trained to kill pople with no remorse. 
Fuck, Hollywood is selling such nazi propaganda these days."
CmRih_VtVAs,All of my  hype is going for this movie than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Trailer ever! Omg
CmRih_VtVAs,In David Ayer we trust
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow... Margot looks good, but holy shit. DC has to be the worst at casting their heroes. Seriously. She won't be as bad as skinny bitch as Wonder Womanish but still."
CmRih_VtVAs,a well deserved answer to u marvel ...!// go f**k urself
CmRih_VtVAs,The lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody are like a perfect fuck you to all the people who for no reason wrote off DC
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy Shit the amount of great superhero movies coming out this year or around it are insane.
CmRih_VtVAs,joker and enchantress are insane
CmRih_VtVAs,what the big-uppercase-F does Bohemian Rhapsody got to do with B-movie characters blowing stuff up?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm touching myself tonight
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than the other trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"This has to be the best trailer ever made in history. In all galaxies (yes, both DC and Marvel :P )"
CmRih_VtVAs,hope DC making a very different unique tone to their movies...!! a well deserved answer to you mArvel../!!! go f**k urself
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie should've used the accent she had in Wolf of Wallstreet
CmRih_VtVAs,hope DC making a very different unique tone to their movies...!! a well deserved answer to you mArvel../!!! go f**k urself
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie always does something with me. I love her. Marry me.
CmRih_VtVAs,All of those clips better be in the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the Darude Sandstorm?
CmRih_VtVAs,Still like Heath Ledger Joker better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Song in trailer:
 
Queen – Bohemian Rhapsody"
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel can eat their heart out. There's a new king in town.
CmRih_VtVAs,What a strange choice of music
CmRih_VtVAs,This is same like Guardian of galaxy trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I like the trailer but I'm still not sold on the movie but we shall see.
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know who that is at 1:44?
CmRih_VtVAs,This. Looks. Perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,Mark my words: He's going to be better than Ledger. QQ all you want.
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here to show you my toys!!!! omg best joker ever!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,worst harley quinn ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,PASS
CmRih_VtVAs,really will ? let save the world?....
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie will be so many time better than batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,love the colors when the font appears tis nice
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer was a peak at the movie that wasn't even intended to be released as soon as it was. I mean, do people really think that they're going to be running around on here cracking jokes left and right? If you change the music to this trailer then you'll instantly have a wicked movie trailer, not to say that this one wasn't though, because I loved it."
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOME!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm getting the useless black widow vibe from Harley. While everyone else are enhanced freaks, at least will smiff has godlike marksmanship. She's just standing there with a bat saying stupid shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ever since I've installed adblock, all single girls in my area seem to have lost interest."
CmRih_VtVAs,Very White boy corny lines smh
CmRih_VtVAs,I honestly think Quinn is gonna steal the show but we'll get enough joker to be satisfied
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh great, it's the second trailer with another unfitting song, what's wrong? ""Back in Black"" was already taken?

DC want to reach to Marvel's success by making their own ""Avengers"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which is fine, the only two problems are that they started way too late and that both ""Batman VS superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" are looking like crap. 

And what the fuck was up with that harley quinn ass shot... is this movie marketed to 13 yr old kids?"
CmRih_VtVAs,he jumped out out of the bag and started punching people. Hilarious!
CmRih_VtVAs,now this is the most classy trailer i have ever seen apart from the dark knight and watchmen(film sucked)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Never in my life did I think listening to one of my all time favorite songs, I could actually possibly not enjoy it.

This is the moment. Thanks Warner Brothers you pieces of shit.

First off, the first two trailers are completely different. The first one gives you a more serious tone, and then this one gives a full on ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (Which I promise it won't anywhere NEAR as fucking good though). Some of these lines are just shitlord cringe worthy. ""We're bad guys, its what we do"" ""*shivers with cringe* Who the bloody hell wrote these lines mate? 12 year olds who just discovered dialogue? What a way to butcher an already overrated character(she works better as a sidekick to Joker, lets not kid ourselves) Oh but the real kicker is fuckface portrayal of Joker. I am not condemning Jared Leto, he is great actor, I am insulting this version of the joker. ""Oh but he comes froms the comic books, they are ripping straight out the pages"" I DONT GIVE A FUCK! They are taking the worst Joker look there is. Its like taking the Adam West batman and putting him in BVS.

Now read this part right HERE, yes you fanboy. I am not hoping this film would be bad. Only a self righteous piece of shit does that. I want this to be good, like every film I spend my money and most importantly, time of my life on. It's just when I see a cringe worthy, horribly acted, full of mediocre actors, and sub par actions sequences,  I say it like it fucking is. Maybe its because i'm not a desperate DC fanboy, that i'm not drooling over this. If the film turns out to be good, then fucking beautiful, but if not, don't say I didn't fucking tell you here first."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:42 I love that fucking panda. Most interested to see what he's up to.
CmRih_VtVAs,This look like poop and smells
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,great song but welcome to the jungle will be a perfect fit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:23 Marilyn Manson is that you? xD seriusly, i think love the Leto Joker ♥"
CmRih_VtVAs,literally the best trailer man! i cant wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,СкореБыСкорееБыСкорееБы!!! 1111
CmRih_VtVAs,They are making this look more like a comedy film now. Will be waiting till it comes out on Blu Ray.
CmRih_VtVAs,GREATEST. TRAILER. EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,The music and comedy of this trailer gave me a Guardians of the galaxy vibe.
CmRih_VtVAs,everybody: the song is called bohemian rhapsody. there. if you wait for these smug try-hard-to-be-cultured-about-music bitches to give you the title you're wasting your time :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Эти можно брать и обмазываться.
CmRih_VtVAs,ayer did a good job directing fury. suicide squad will be  good!
CmRih_VtVAs,music ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Gotta admit. This looks pretty...pretty...pretty...good.
CmRih_VtVAs,bad choice of music I have nothing against Queen but I heard it too many times I'm sick of it
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that maybe the Suicide Squad is there to take down Batman. You know 'cause he's a vigilante and a menace? So the government is under stress about it and turns to the 'devils' of Gotham.
CmRih_VtVAs,"not bad, but i dont like joker in here, so cheesy
hope it will be good movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype is fucking killing me
CmRih_VtVAs,This is DCs answer to Guardians! Nice!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks better than BATMAN v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto o.o
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok..... OK, since you picked one of the greatest songs ever for your trailer, colour me hyped."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you people?

We're bad guys. It's what we do!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks aweasome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Didn't get me pumped at all. 
The last Suicide Squad Trailer was one of the greatest things ever!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg this trailer made my fucking day
CmRih_VtVAs,"fukin 2016 !! the cgi looks amazing, awesome actors, badass characters, this is gonna be a hell of a movie :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is just, I'm trying so hard not to cry from happiness this is beautiful."
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's see this versus Deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is looking fineeee.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn crazy but so kute :D :v
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wouldnt have kept Bohemian Rhapsody all the way thru the trailer, just the beginning. Other than that, trailer is allright"
CmRih_VtVAs,It's awesome but joker look suck
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one who didnt like killer-croc of this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,The best of the trailer is the Freddie Mercury voice... :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Haha love Harleys ""Daddy's Lil Monster"" shirt at the end"
CmRih_VtVAs,No tengo palabras
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love the cast. Trailer surprised me, I think this will be a good adaptation. Wish Margot used that awesome accent she has in the Wolf of Wall Street for Harley. Not a deal breaker at all though. A movie that's well casted. Thank you !"
CmRih_VtVAs,So cheesy. Wow.... But guess i will see it. Sooner or later. HahahaHAHAHAHAAHAHAAAAAAA!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The greatest trailer of a decade for sure! Amazing editing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Im way more excited for Batman v Superman than this crap
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm going to watch this bc of Cara😂
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Are those drawings in the background made by Die Antwoord?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sometimes the trailers are better than the actual films, I hope that isn't the case here"
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen and Suicide Squad.. I'm satisfied! Can't wait for August
CmRih_VtVAs,will acid change their appearance at 1:58?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i think it kinda sucked actually. sure the film will be good, but her harley voice isn´t as good as the first one and I don´t really get the tone!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"For those asking about the song in the trailer it's: Darude - Sandstorm
You are very welcome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Better development than Civil War.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer has a Guardians Of The Galaxy vibe to it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who was the dumbass that put Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can anyone tell me what that thing at 1:44-1:45 and 1:52-1:53 is? One of the few things that made me really skeptical about this trailer. Looks so CG and out of place. At first I thought it was supposed to be Poison Ivy or something, but it looks like a dude."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is everything and I'm so excited
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd say best trailer yet. Seems like the antihero flick DC wants it to be to contend with deadpool. Now THAT said I still don't think it will be very good. Still not crazy about any of the cast. I think Batman v Superman will tank too. They just don't have it where Marvel(epically Disney Marvel) dose. I wish they did.
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks like a rated R Guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yep, after watching this trailer, this is still one of my most anticipated films of 2016. Even more so than Batman V Superman. I can't wait for this movie to come out. This is going to be one hell of a year for comic book movies.  :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is just perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,fodaaaaaaaaaaaaa
CmRih_VtVAs,"Non so se abbia avuto un'erezione per il trailer, per Margot Robbie o per Jared Leto."
CmRih_VtVAs,what is this song called? i think my ears died. horrid.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bullshit with cheesy dialogues.
CmRih_VtVAs,Man I gotta see this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Next time you make a trailer ,DONT PUBLISH IT, .MARVEL is dead , BURY IT,.Consider this MERCY"
CmRih_VtVAs,puffff
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY QUINN MY LOVE
CmRih_VtVAs,crap film.
CmRih_VtVAs,جاي من طرف محمد الشريف
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT ARE THOOOOOSE
CmRih_VtVAs,That guy with soda can! (Tom hardy?)
CmRih_VtVAs,So F^&&%^$ EPIC.. this is what they should do when making a Trailer 100% sync. with the background music.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow... Finally a movie that gets me hyped to see and then they just had to drop the bomb on me at the end saying coming out in fucking August 😩
CmRih_VtVAs,garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,When this song on spotify pls ?
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't get it...Margo Robbie sounded more like Harley Quinn in Wolf of wall street. So why did they not use that voice.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm trying to figure out whom they're fighting. 🤔
CmRih_VtVAs,beautiful!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 Oh God...
CmRih_VtVAs,"when marvel fanboys say ""dc is so serious"" show them this add"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks fucking awful, just another shitty abortion spewed out by another shitty director."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 : Something really unique.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie doesn't even sound close to what harley is supposed to sound like. What happened to the New Yorker/ Jersey accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,Coolest trailer ever made Warner.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker and Harley Quinn..........
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know that this movie is awesome, but no matter how many movies you make and put a joker in it you'll never replace the original true joker Heath Ledger (R.I.P)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"What a change from the teaser trailer. The teaser was all dark and mysterious. This trailer gives you the feeling they're fooling around having fun doing crazy shit. The choice of song obviously is a big reason why, but still."
CmRih_VtVAs,Music from last part pls
CmRih_VtVAs,I cringed every time Margot Robie said something... I'm excited but CAUTIOUSLY optimistic for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it bad I think Jai Courtney actually looks like a good actor in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody makes everything better! That Guardians of the Galaxy trailer (with Hooked on a Feeling at the end of it) really had an impact on the way trailers are done these days. This trailer is beautiful and genius, and you can see that it's a progression of that trailer style."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whoever put this trailer together deserves a raise!!! Hopefully the movie's just as good, or better!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,"MAN!, this trailer was amazing!, they put the perfect soundtrack to it"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not trolling I'm just commenting. The trailer looks a bit bland because they havent given me anything to go on. It just the truth
CmRih_VtVAs,So am I the only one who doesn't like the Jokers laugh and teeth? 
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 oh yeah, nice booty. feminists will scream out loud now"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show my toys..JOKER
CmRih_VtVAs,Michael c hall should have played the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 is so cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool will nail this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,It feels like the Joker is the only redeeming part of this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why are they trying to make Jai Courtney look like Tom Hardy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry Marvel, DC is owning it!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot went bat-shit crazy after the divorce with Leo
CmRih_VtVAs,hmm... actually kinda excited for this movie now.
CmRih_VtVAs,forgot the last time a trailer gave me goosebumps
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is gonna experience his Hancock days again.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This convinced me to give the movie and Jared Leto as the Joker a chance.  

The shells hitting the ground to match the music at 1:50 was awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hopefully this has put a stop to all the Jared as Joker naysayers. 
Heath was amazing. He was amazing acting out his and Christopher Nolan's version of what the Joker should be like.
Jared doesn't have to ""beat"" Heath's Joker. He's going to give his interpretation of this version of Joker and by the look of it, it's going to be just as awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm just wathing this cause of Margot Robie, cause the Jared Letto is fucking gay for a Joker, the witch is fucking weird, the Will Smith is the smart ass like ""Lets gonna sabe the world"" or ""Dont kill people guys"" or ""Thats all folks"", the crocodile proboly Dont say a word, the fire guy is an júnior, and the cop is like "" What the hell"" or ""My god you'r bad people"" Thats gonna be more garbage than Batman VS Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The tone changed so much from the last trailer. Looks much more fun now. Not a Marvel type fun, but a unique DC type crazy fun movie. I was on the fence before, but this trailer has me sold. Still iffy about Leto's Joker though. Simply because Ledger left such a strong mark on me."
CmRih_VtVAs,"O clipe ficou bom.
A música é uma das melhores músicas já feitas da história.

o clipe + a música não se encaixaram."
CmRih_VtVAs,Omfg YES. I NEED THIS NOW.
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad and Deadpool > Batman v Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC, take note.  THAT is how you advertise a movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I've just wet my pants. Brb...
CmRih_VtVAs,finally some legendary music in a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer tá foda
CmRih_VtVAs,Why doesn't Harley have Brooklyn accent? One of the reasons everyone wanted Margo  to play Harley was her voice in Wolf of Wall Street.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie <3
CmRih_VtVAs,not sure harley pulled it off
CmRih_VtVAs,"wait, Floyd Lawton is black @@"
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST. TRAILER. EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,batman was there u just didn't see him ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,paia de mais
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody made the 4/5 of trailer's epicness.
CmRih_VtVAs,Not gonna lie but I liked the look of old Joker better. This one seems kinda shit and more like a girl.
CmRih_VtVAs,BAD
CmRih_VtVAs,I was mainly listening to the song but the trailer is good too.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,this has to be rated r other wise it sucks (if its anything like the comics its rated r)
CmRih_VtVAs,I shat my pants
CmRih_VtVAs,So colorful...beautiful mastery of vividly painting the images so perfect from thought to cinema....damn good job
CmRih_VtVAs,Накой ляд квина сюда воткнули чё больше исполнителей нет? или трек запелить новый нельзя? эта песня сюда люто неподходит(((((((((((((((((((((!
CmRih_VtVAs,АХУЕННО
CmRih_VtVAs,mmmmmm very kids
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,00:35 why use the zipper when you can just cut the body bag open. This guy must be the coolest guy in town.
CmRih_VtVAs,The use of Bohemian Rhapsody was perfect for this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"if this is their idea of a ""great trailer"", it didn't quite cut it for me. and the background music - i think it just doesn't fit in this trailer. i hope the action scenes are not like the transformers with people and machines colliding into each other."
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow, looks horrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,....and Bohemian Rhapsody jumps up the iTunes download charts......
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer bored the hell out of me. This on sold me to watch this movie.. But it kinda feels like a Guardians of the Galaxy with the Bad people given a chance , and the epic oldies music .."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I CAN'T STOP WATCHING.

The Enchantress will be my favorite already."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really like what I see, except I still hate Leto as the Joker. He looks more like an emo kid than the Joker. Also, I cringed at the laugh"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hollywood, stop trying to make Jai Courtney happen"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope for a rated R version :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith??? Super heroes movies???? And not promo his son Jaden Smith...What a surprise.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer's so good I think it will be even better than the movie itself
CmRih_VtVAs,F*ckin AWESOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is sick!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Movie looks whack as fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,"Somehow, I knew it would be released in IMAX 3D. But it does look like a fun movie to watch."
CmRih_VtVAs,Not sure if good trailer or jut queen
CmRih_VtVAs,YES YES YES YES YES
CmRih_VtVAs,"That is not fair, playing Queen... Everything is better with Queen. That is cheating!"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 You're welcome.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie, nuff said."
CmRih_VtVAs,Dirty Dozen for betas
CmRih_VtVAs,i hate it:(
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just wish this movie won't suck.,not only this but every superhero movie should be awesome next year"
CmRih_VtVAs,I really miss Quinn's Boston accent...
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing trailer. So excited for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,dat ass tho
CmRih_VtVAs,You had me at the intro to Bohemian Rhapsody.
CmRih_VtVAs,god margot robbie looks fucking stunning even as a psycho criminal
CmRih_VtVAs,i think i jizzed my pants
CmRih_VtVAs,wow 1 million views in 7 hours!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Excellent !
CmRih_VtVAs,oi eu sou Brasileiro
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it just me, or is Will Smith the one with the most screen time because he's the most bankable? (I love Will Smith, but still...) My worries about the Joker are gone, and I never doubted Margot Robbie... This looks like it's gonna be awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,what book is harley reading?
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoooooooooooooowwwwowhhooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK YEAH
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wrong twitter logo, WB. Shame on you =)"
CmRih_VtVAs,epic
CmRih_VtVAs,much better than dawn of couple.
CmRih_VtVAs,So who are the bad people or antagonists here?
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT.
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this? Bad guys covered in cotton candy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ice Age > This
CmRih_VtVAs,só os br saberão ser br
CmRih_VtVAs,This was insanely great.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the Japanese character?
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone spot Scott Eastwood?
CmRih_VtVAs,Убийственно...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman is so awesome, even the villains get their own movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is destroying!
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,I never thought i'd get excited about a DC movie. Margot Robbie will do that though i guess :p
CmRih_VtVAs,All i need is a deadshot costume
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody is going to get a lot of views after this...
CmRih_VtVAs,Nope...... Still not feeling it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant wait to watch this!! I might commit suicide hahahaha..
CmRih_VtVAs,who's the bad guy in this movie anyway?
CmRih_VtVAs,nah
CmRih_VtVAs,Ну теперь зато не надо фильм смотреть)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I know this will probably not happen because blind fanboy-ism runs rampant but please can no one start a ""R.I.P. Marvel"" or ""DC is better than Marvel"" non-existent war just after seeing this fucking awesome trailer. In a perfect world we all can enjoy both but that probably is not going to happen"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this PG-13 or are we going to see some people get fucked up?
CmRih_VtVAs,"MARVEL, tell me, do you bleed ? You will."
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman is missing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel fans gonna hate !
CmRih_VtVAs,To good to be true...
CmRih_VtVAs,how to ruin a song...
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie *dies*
CmRih_VtVAs,0:16 - Who is this character?
CmRih_VtVAs,Сколько можно потчевать мир этой комиксной хуитой?
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes!! Awesome trailer!! Kill off deadshot or put his mask on. Take all our monies!
CmRih_VtVAs,"“What was that? I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry. It’s the voices. Haha I’m kidding… That’s not what they really said”  Harley Quinn is awesome, childlike charm yet she's crazy! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate the grill and tattoos tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like that we're at a time were Slipknot ""a guy"" can punch a woman in the face in a movie and it's fine, damn women are really progressing. #hillaryclinton2016"
CmRih_VtVAs,I think someone should let Harley know she's not wearing any pants.
CmRih_VtVAs,"huh, suddenly the promos make this look like a fun movie. considering who directs it I believe this is some serious spin. did Skull Poop L stel your ""diffrent kind of superhero movie"" thunder and you are trying to jump on that train? I bet people are editing the holy crap out of this movie right now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"that's what a trailer should look like!
AWESOME!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm in love with Harley Quinn, she's sooo amazing!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Big shoes to fill Jared
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love this trailer, I am so excited for Jared Leto as The Joker!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:37 Katana'a Eyes ......fukin awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:44 ok the guy that just severed that train, who is that guy? He can make tendrilloking things too if you look at some parts in this trailer. This looks really good. Introducing a bunch of guys with abilities and powers in one movie to see some action between bad guys and not just the normal superhero stuff. These guys don´t just wanna fight and knock each other out. They want to tear each other apart in every way possible. Just hoping they got the characters right. Also i really wanna see how different it will be to see the civil war movie with superheroes fighting each other, and then this where it´s the other way around and just villians fighting."
CmRih_VtVAs,God I love this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,FIGHT CLUB
CmRih_VtVAs,"nice trailer

shity music

and yeah because queen are the best music group/band in some old faggs eyes doesnt mean its true"
CmRih_VtVAs,Foda de mais 👌
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST?!?! I'm going to freeze myself like Cartman in South Park until it comes out.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 Is all you needed to see.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've seen the animated Suicide Squad... this is cool, but it could quite easily be a disaster."
CmRih_VtVAs,Funny as fuck 😂 this is awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"Slipknot is lame as f, talk about Aquaman at last the dude can survive 100.000+ Psi living under the ocean and shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,This or Civil War?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto as the Joker..... holy freaking CRAP!!!! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that a hint of Heath Ledger when Leto talks 1:19 ? Still sounds great.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this is just stupid, the film is already done. They are just spit balling us."
CmRih_VtVAs,БОЖЕ ЭТО ЩИДЕВР!
CmRih_VtVAs,omg I can't wait to see this when it comes out in cinema!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2 seconds in and they're playing Bohemian Rhapsody...I can't even handle it anymore...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't really like the majority of comics based movies, but this looks amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Where the hell is Harley Quinn's normal accent??
CmRih_VtVAs,the comic con first look trailer was just about the serious side but now when i see this one its only and only bout the super crazy side. in short this movie's gonna be effing awesome!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen e Esquadrão Suicida! Trailer fodastico!♥
CmRih_VtVAs,"Respect to the cutter, this trailers rocks tha shit outta everything!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The music was epic
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians Of The Galaxy: DC Edition
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley has some nice tits.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who notices the glowing green tentacle suit at 1:44 and 1:52? Anyway, this movie is going to kick ass"
CmRih_VtVAs,Da Persona 5 Mask.
CmRih_VtVAs,And Warner Bros  has officially ruined Harley - forever.
CmRih_VtVAs,Love how the joker looks like a Mexican drug lord
CmRih_VtVAs,"everyone here is trying to start Marvel vs Dc war,but thats nonr of my bussines"
CmRih_VtVAs,Holly mutha fucking Shiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttt
CmRih_VtVAs,no deathstroke? 😐
CmRih_VtVAs,"it looks like they wanna make a ""deadpool"" or something. Harley seems like she is about to say "" look at me, im acting"". Imo this looks a bit forced"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Appealing vibrant colors, Badass characters, Joker, Batman cameo and an amazing trailer. THE PERFECT RECIPE OF SUCCESS"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone explain to me what this is going to be about exactly? I mean whose the villain and such?
CmRih_VtVAs,Why people should watch this? Just to spoiler all the best scene? U got shit in your head fcking Warner Bros?
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This for me was an AWSOME trailer. I have no doubt Leto will be good!
CmRih_VtVAs,My question is .... how do you keep those colours in your hair inside a cell.... Damn Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,HOL UP
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara being the Witch is Great but this Harley Quinn really is Something
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks absolutely fucking maaaad!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,good tralier!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,why i love the bad guys.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still, some fucknuts from MCU hated it, for some reason DC cant make anything is it? This is one of the best trailer i've seen, its different. BvS comic-con was also epic but again, it got a lot of hates. Captain America Civil war trailer was boring, i prefer AoU trailer over Civil war because it gave me goosebums and it was darker than Civil War but i dont see any hate for civil war at all, Biased motherfucker."
CmRih_VtVAs,oh shit kitana's sword might actually steal souls
CmRih_VtVAs,Big shoes to fill Jared
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever 😵🤘🏼
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wonder who Eastwood is playing, Deathstroke!?"
CmRih_VtVAs,If I were to pick one of the two women of course I'd pick Margot Robbie
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys"" - Sounds like a nice little nod to Nicholson's Joker there, delivery was very similar to how Jack Nicholson said ""Where does he get those wonderful toys?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Soooo what's this movie about?Just introducing the Suicide Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,Where ist he Bismillah ?==?
CmRih_VtVAs,"SO MUCH YES!!! 
HARLEY IM SORRY FOR DOUBTING YOU!
I CANT WAIT!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is gonna be amazing i just know it!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll watch this movie only bcoz of the joker character
CmRih_VtVAs,"QUEEN
QUEEN
QUEEN
MY FAV BAND
O MYYYYYYYYY GOOOOD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why internet people are so fucking anoying????
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you do a trailer not that fuck up with Batman v Superman showing the whole plot.
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok,now this puts it at the second place on my ""most anticipated movies of 2016"" after Deadpool."
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear they've just shown scenes from the entire movie in 2 and a half minutes
CmRih_VtVAs,"only good thing about the trailer was the music  & I have no idea why they say that is there first trailer when it is not :p

they must of forgot about there own Suicide Squad - Comic-Con First Look footage which is a trailer also"
CmRih_VtVAs,I like that we know almost nothing about Deadshot.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does editing take so long!!!!! I have to wait till august!!! UGH
CmRih_VtVAs,Boring... Want to make what... An action crime comedy..?
CmRih_VtVAs,"My main concern with the DCU is that things will be too gray and serious and dour.
This trailer smashes those worries to bits. Good choice with Queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joel Kinnaman, is awesome in Netflix's 'The Killing', he's badass"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dayum Harley is hot
CmRih_VtVAs,"Illuminati did 9/11, deal with it, and Jeb Bush will be prez and finish what his brother started."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm gonna need more superhero movies like this. Hopefully DCCU has a little more fun like this this appears to be, and isn't all dark destructive Man of Steel-type movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,"THE MUSIC!!!!!! The right choice!!!! 
We're bad guys!!! 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley brooklyn accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is the reason of why I hate zch snyder
CmRih_VtVAs,"i think what they think, the volume should be on the top level"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:47 reminds me of Handsome Jack's introduction in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's not kid ourselves. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is on another level itself. Suicide Squad is still awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53 Oh god
CmRih_VtVAs,IS THIS THE REAL LIFE? #SuicideSquad X #BohemianRhapsody might just make for the best film trailer of all time #WatchWednesday  #Queen #FreddieMercury
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is Hancock in this movie? Im confused.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please YOUTUBE, let me like this video more than once!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody?

Yeah I think they're trying to ride the lightning that guardians of the galaxy struck by adding classic songs, thinking the magic will carry over to the movie.

Hopefully it's good but it looks like garbage"
CmRih_VtVAs,one of the best trailers I've seen in a long time
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome trailer and good music hopefully the movie is good :)
CmRih_VtVAs,I am out of words
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anybody have any idea(s) on who/what that is at 1:43 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen are going to be really famous now because of this trailer... Suicide Squad sent me here incoming in 3...2...1...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Music is too loud!!!
It feels more like a \music video, than a movie.."
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this movie is gonna be beter that BvS just because of the good CGI
CmRih_VtVAs,WE r bad guys it's what we do {fking awesome}
CmRih_VtVAs,Great just another 7 months... ):
CmRih_VtVAs,who is the bad boy  on this movie?
CmRih_VtVAs,Still Deadpool 's gonna be the most fucking awesome comic movie this year .
CmRih_VtVAs,PLEASE CHECK OUT MY REACTION VIDEO TO THIS INSANE AWESOME TRAILER!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy 1.5 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Still waiting for deathstroke...
CmRih_VtVAs,Weak. First trailer way better.  Using that queen track made it feel like it's gonna be more action than serious. The first trailer was dope.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg nobody asked song's name.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yisus motherfucking christ Margot you're GOD DAMN HOT!
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVAH
CmRih_VtVAs,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is one of the best trailers that I've seen, you are fucked up Guardians Of The Galaxy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, THE BAD GUYS TURN!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Maybe I'm not familiar enough with these characters to get pumped, but the trailer didn't do it for me. It seemed very try hard."
CmRih_VtVAs,insanely awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"No Thanks, none of that looked good in my opinion"
CmRih_VtVAs,That one has got written trash all over it!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,what the song name when trailer start?
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK CONOR MCGREGOR
CmRih_VtVAs,It would be better If They followed the Arrow series ANd had the deathstroke from there instead of takeing some guy ...
CmRih_VtVAs,where is batman ?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Groot ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The only Marvel films I've seen so far has been Incredible Hulk, Thor and Iron Man. I've no interest in Marvel. So excited for DC's movies this year! :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,the most beautiful thing I ever saw in life.
CmRih_VtVAs,''i cant wait to show you my toys'' that's what she said
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thought Leto's Joker suks, but now I see clearly - he's going to be way out cooler then previous ones anyway"
CmRih_VtVAs,Taylor Swift squad-Suicide squad=One battle i'd like to see.
CmRih_VtVAs,this going to be better than bat vs sup i'm sure
CmRih_VtVAs,An epic trailer with an epic sound track. Brilliant!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is crazy!! I was listening to this song like five minutes ago during my smoke break!. Sucks now I listen to it again and think of a movie (bc I hate that shit) but that shit was cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is what I love about DC. Such compelling characters.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, that was a tone shift from the first trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy - Black Comedy Version
CmRih_VtVAs,song sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,Where IS iron Man bro?
CmRih_VtVAs,I love Jared Leto. I love the Joker. And it hurts me to say this. But does anyone else think he's missed the mark here?
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing trailer. the music was PERFECT. B V S should've taken notes.
CmRih_VtVAs,dog shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dear good God this was beautiful and perfect. People need to stop freaking complaining about Harley's accent. Joker looks magnificent.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie could mark the first time ever that jai courtney is gonna be likeable...
CmRih_VtVAs,Bad guys wanna be... jesh this shit is for kids...
CmRih_VtVAs,👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like this had all the good scene's in it...
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. That looks just awful.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The more I see of DC`s new stuff, the less optimistic I am that it won`t be shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker looks awesome, eat your hearts out haters"
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for second part already!
CmRih_VtVAs,where is batman??
CmRih_VtVAs,Robbie's Harley Quinn portrayal looks spot on but Leto's Joker still seems like its gonna be a miss and not a hit
CmRih_VtVAs,DC's Guardians of the Galaxy ( With steroids )
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC once again proves that marvel movies are for children and for guys who haven't gotten laid,"
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC Comics > MarBel
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ♥♥♥
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not sure if this is as epic as the Mad Max trailers, but it sure as hell got me amped up for this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"...meh,.. everything is just fine but leto.. I dont think he is goin to work as joker.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Oh Marvel I'm not going to kill you, I'm just going to hurt you..really, really bad..."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody!!! 😍 super excited, can't stop smiling!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker look crazy asf.and i mean crazy i mean fucking cool
CmRih_VtVAs,"Simply the BEST TRAILER EVER.
With Bohemian Rhapsody you just won everything."
CmRih_VtVAs,Pause at 2:07 . You're welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,rip #marvel #fanboys :p :D
CmRih_VtVAs,That is song
CmRih_VtVAs,Compared to this i think batman v superman looks really awful. Their trailer real sucks.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't no why some People are bitching about this trailer????
This trailer is so fucking EPIC!!! So STOP bitching!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing... make my day
CmRih_VtVAs,Härligt att se Joel kinnaman utvecklas som skådespelare:)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please stop with the stupid ""RIP Marvel"" and ""Better than MCU"" comments. You can enjoy both."
CmRih_VtVAs,I will be in the next one
CmRih_VtVAs,I think will smiths character will die in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG HELL YER!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think this trailer is gonna mislead people into thinking it's a fun, action, mildly violent movie. I'm gonna stick to the vibe of the comic con trailer: Emotionally intense, sadistic, dark comedy humor, crime...with CGI. 

I LOVE DC! Marvel is like the nice guy, DC is the badass."
CmRih_VtVAs,01.52 Is That Emma Watson??
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fuck this is really good.
CmRih_VtVAs,LOVE IT!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still not digging the new joker but we'll see when the movie hits theaters
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hopefully Will Smith gets nominated for his ""Let's go save the world"" quote.

I hear Jada is ignoring the Oscars if he doesn't get nominated every year!!! 

Trailer is amazing!"
CmRih_VtVAs,look like an old joker when i was a kid
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 thats a gif... thats a gif... GIF THAT
CmRih_VtVAs,ELO😁
CmRih_VtVAs,That Joker laugh in 1:23 is just ......WOW......!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks cool but give us what we want. a joker movie!            STOP!           A RATED R JOKER MOVIE!!! when are you gonna let me cuCUMber DC. FOR GODS SAKE LET ME CUCUMBER!
CmRih_VtVAs,Thumbs Up if you are more excited by this film than Batman vs Superman. This movie looks bat shit crazy. I can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys!!
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone know whos at 1:44 ??
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK, now I'm hyped."
CmRih_VtVAs,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Blend of black comedy,action and CRAZZZZZzzzzzy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fuckin august, I need it NOW!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Awesome trailer, love how this seems to be their more fun film then BvS will probably be their epic and dramatic film"
CmRih_VtVAs,We are bad guys that's all we do
CmRih_VtVAs,"Captain Boomerang bought me. I just hope he'll be as crazy in the movie as he's in this trailer. Darn, can't wait to see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07
dat ass?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"BTW: Have you noticed when Harley smashes the shop window at the end? A t-shirt in the shop says: ""Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum"" (He who wants peace prepares for war)

Nice touch"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto as the Joker is equilavent to Rosie O Donnel as Spawn.
CmRih_VtVAs,So guardians of the galaxy but DC
CmRih_VtVAs,1:14 Why did they get a fat chick to play Harley? Kinda ruins it.
CmRih_VtVAs,guns n roses?  wow...rebirth!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Like the BvS trailer, I know I should be excited... but I'm not. The Deadpool trailers were great, this was just... meh."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok so the first sneak peek trailer had me at "" Are you the Devil ? "" 
Now we get the comedy relief trailer ?!?

Dafuq you people doing over there with these damn DC comic movie properties. 
WHO'S IDEA IS IT TO KEEP CHANGING THE TONE OF THESE MOVIES ?!? 

Fire whoever it is cause damn"
CmRih_VtVAs,I may need to change my pants
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh god, its in August. Dunno if I can wait that long."
CmRih_VtVAs,yup im ready for this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen, ❤."
CmRih_VtVAs,Squad goals. I LOVE EVERYTHING IN THIS!!
CmRih_VtVAs,ace... first dc or marvel movie I've been looking forward too
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm kinda sad how Harley comes across I mean she's a really in depth character, more then some crazy sex doll. Still in excited."
CmRih_VtVAs,Kind of reminds me of Guardians of the galaxy but now they are psychotic and more villainy than average.
CmRih_VtVAs,this is basically what the sinister six movie would be.
CmRih_VtVAs,Rip marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,That acid jump looked awesome. That's all I wanted to say.
CmRih_VtVAs,So I think I found out they are hunting an evil groot that leaves green crystals hmm.
CmRih_VtVAs,"YEEES!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!! EXACTLY!! GOOD!!

...sorry, was just happy about that.
You see, when they showed the very first trailer for Suicide Squad, I was like: ""That's gonna be horrible! Suicide Squad's supposed to be fun! This movie just looks far too dark!""
THIS trailer, on the other hand, demonstrates that the movie is on the good road: it's fun, it's silly, it's edgy but not grim!! NOW I'm hyped!"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Very nice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ha they really just had to have Will Smith say ""let's go save the world"" again didn't they?"
CmRih_VtVAs,God Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn and excellent song choices. This and Deadpool and X-Men and Civil Wars and Batman V Superman make this an awesome time to be alive for comic book readers :D. If this was R Rated than +1
CmRih_VtVAs,Imagine if punisher was in sucide squed that would be fucking amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,00:30 What a poossy pfff. With Bronson/Hardy wouldn't be so easy.
CmRih_VtVAs,00:30 What a pussy pfff. With Bronson/Hardy wouldn't be so easy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Fanboys more like bitchboys
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally some Scott Eastwood haha
CmRih_VtVAs,Sinister six
CmRih_VtVAs,"The part where Joker says: ""I can't wait to show you my toys"" might be an homage to Heath Ledger's Joker  when he's talking about his abusive father."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ehhh Hollywood is Dying.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto looks awesome, but the trailer sucks? Is it just me? I guess nah...."
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,jared leto performance is realy bad i didnt feel it at all .. 👎👎👎👎 ... i was expecting better from margot .. 👎👎👎.. but i will watch the movie Anyway !!
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody feels new again
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeey! Finally League of Legends The Movie! Jinx, Brand, Schaco, Renekton Lucian and Akali! Oh... Wait."
CmRih_VtVAs,TOOT TOOT ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Title card's really fucking pretty, negl."
CmRih_VtVAs,why dont they release whole movie on utube ?  ridiculous amount of the movie shown in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yo, that was ON POINT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like both marvel and DC. But I do think Marvel has had more Great movies than DC. Sure DC had Watchmen and Nolans batman, but they also had Batman & Robin and man of steel, which were both horrible movies (My opinion) But hey marvel had great movies as Guardians of the Galaxy, Antman, and The Avengers. But they also had the Daredevil Movie & and The Fantastic 4. so it's even"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, I'm excited."
CmRih_VtVAs,I have such high expectations for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"One of the most well-edited trailers I've ever seen. Give whoever cut this together an Oscar, for real... 
I wasn't even THAT excited to see this movie before, but now I feel more inclined to check it out if it ends up being as entertaining as these 2 and a half minutes were!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Could be interesting, then again Jai Courtney is in this so who knows?"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC has taken the thrown!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:22 Holy shit, The Residents are in this!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Minty fresh!
CmRih_VtVAs,"So far, I see a very impressive performance from Jared Leto and Margot Robbie.  I knew Jared Leto wouldn't let me down.  His interpretation is very creative, and I respect that. We SHOULD ALL respect that!  Thumbs up if you agree!"
CmRih_VtVAs,For anyone who haven't heard this song it's bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Die Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,For anyone who haven't heard this song it's bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Teaser trailer was so much better
CmRih_VtVAs,is it odd that I am more excited for this movie this year then BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,Year of the anti hero?
CmRih_VtVAs,First trailer was dark as fuck and second is funny as hell! hahahha  :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cool trailer but I'm just gonna say this, no one and I mean NO ONE!! Should be asking for the name of the song either you're too young or too ignorant & stupid"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm still not confident about the movie but my god this was an awesome trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the trailer. 2016 - The year that Marvel dies?
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh could go either way.
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank you God
CmRih_VtVAs,"Genial trailer con Queen de fondo, deseando ver la película :-)"
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one here who just cant stop hitting the replay button
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks very cool...but it totally sucks that they got rid of Harley Quinn's iconic accent :-(
CmRih_VtVAs,just feels so much random
CmRih_VtVAs,"still reserving judgement, but iM' worried about leto's joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,woah woah my soul wasn't ready for this.... keep the fuck calm down DC!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"*DC Releases the tough gritty trailers for Batman VS Superman and Suicide Squad*
*Marvel happens*
*DC changes the tone of everything to be Marvel*
Fucking hell. Tone change much?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hey!! Where's Spider-Man??
CmRih_VtVAs,Not sure.
CmRih_VtVAs,You haven't earned it. The difference when Avengers did it was they established their characters first. This is a bad idea. You are going to have to establish all of these characters within a 2 hour time frame while still having an entertaining narrative and it is just going to be a cluster fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,"What a great trailer, and the music was perfect !! Mad Max was the best film of last year, one more great film coming from Warner."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is hottt
CmRih_VtVAs,Jada Pinkett Smith will probably be pissed Will Smith isn't nominated for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,has this been rated yet?? is it R or PG 13
CmRih_VtVAs,"do we already know who is going to be the bad guy? i heard the joker will be just a cameo and not the bad guy, could be wrong of course"
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK BOYS 6 MONTHS LEFT, STAY STRONG"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait did this new DC universe actually learn how to have fun?
CmRih_VtVAs,Totally ripping off the style of Guardians of the Galaxy movie. Trying so hard to make an operatic movie. 
CmRih_VtVAs,OH. MY. GOD. BOHEMIAN. RHAPSODY. I. SCREAMED. SO. LOUDLY. OMG. CANNOT. BREATHE.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best moment was Harley Queen joking about what the voices in her heard really said lol
CmRih_VtVAs,惊艳
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like crap but who knows...
CmRih_VtVAs,""" i can't wait so show you my toys "" HA HA HA"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not just yes but, HELL YES !!!  Awesome song and an awesome trailer !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,hype tears are real
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE IT! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a joke
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass 8-)
CmRih_VtVAs,You came here to see the thing on 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"Other than seeing Leto as the joker, this just feels like ""blah"". Then there is the Guardians of the Galaxy vibe with period music!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great job Warner
CmRih_VtVAs,"A Will Smith movie!

Also why does Margot Robbie not have a Brooklyn accent in this for Harley Quinn?  She had one in Wolf of Wall Street and it was perfect for the role!"
CmRih_VtVAs,O.K who paused at 2:06.....
CmRih_VtVAs,#squadgoals 😂 screw batman v superman 😜
CmRih_VtVAs,HOL UP
CmRih_VtVAs,1.16 is that deathstroke?
CmRih_VtVAs,that little whore makes me so fucking...mad and horny at the same time..
CmRih_VtVAs,The faux Marvel vs DC comments are just hilarious.  I mean tittie fuckin' Christ can't we just be fanboys and enjoy the epic year of comic movies for 2016?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sooo excited to watch this movie! Hopefully I'm not disappointed lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so amped for this movie. Margot Robbie & Jared Leto look incredible.
CmRih_VtVAs,sexy squad goals xxx-jokerjob-xxx
CmRih_VtVAs,what are those things they're fighting from 1:16 - 1:18 and 1:48
CmRih_VtVAs,"well, this looks waaaaay promising than BVS"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Could never see that woman as Harley Quinn, Will Smith as deadshot oh please (+_+)"
CmRih_VtVAs,yawn ...
CmRih_VtVAs,wait is the guy punching everyone killer croc or did they just not mention him?
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEY HARLEY HARLEY NO CHILL ON HARLEY I LUV
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tell me Marvel, do you bleed? You will!"
CmRih_VtVAs,01:20 the best scene :X
CmRih_VtVAs,"prepare ur anus guys, these bad guys are gonna wreck the theaters"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow pretty good 😊
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one thinking the first trailer was actually better than this one?
CmRih_VtVAs,How refreshing to see a trailer that has fun and celebrates the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks awesome and queens music really fits the trailer perfectly. I wish it was rated R but I'm sure it'll still be fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,vai corinthians👏👏👏👏👏👏
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit. That's the best trailer I've seen since The Winter Soldier's trailer. Was not expecting that. 

The tone, the characters, everything looks perfect. Great job, guys."
CmRih_VtVAs,"i love  harley quinn
so pretty   
love uuuuuu"
CmRih_VtVAs,Algum BR aqui?
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker+Deadshot (will smith)+harley quinn+everyone else+ freddie mercury's voice= too much awesomeness in one video.
CmRih_VtVAs,The first trailer was badass but this one pretty good too! Love the fact they didnt show too much of the joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS GOING TO BE FUCKING AWESOME !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,my body is ready
CmRih_VtVAs,"This reminds me of guardians of the galaxy which I loved and it was funny and fun, along with dead pool coming out funny and fun, but DC with a movie that's funny and fun..... Yes omg bohemian rapasody is one of the things that made this so good and I can't wait for this its finally something new and original and just insane and looks so great and fun I can't wait"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't be the only one singing to Bohemian Rhapsody while watching the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,you got me at bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Is margot Robbie even real. She's flawless
CmRih_VtVAs,When I heard the opening lyrics for Bohemian Rhapsody I went... don't fuck this up. And I have to say they did amazingly well.
CmRih_VtVAs,Not imptessed. May be it should use another music. More epic. Then it liked me more.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Unfortunately, this movie is PG-13"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm in lol
CmRih_VtVAs,watchmen amped up!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Making our trailer a music video to an awesome song will make it awesome, right?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35
CmRih_VtVAs,@02.13 that's the jelly fish i mean squidward drawn by spongebob with the magic pencile
CmRih_VtVAs,I wasn't ready for this..
CmRih_VtVAs,Where IS MY BATMAN !!!!!!?????? YOU Suckers !
CmRih_VtVAs,It's official. The Joker and Harley are going to steal the show big times.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 what you are looking for
CmRih_VtVAs,and the best part is Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Zajebiste kurwa
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow. Got to admit, every trailer I see of this show makes me more excited...Wish I could say the same about BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Don't mind me, just going to watch the movie like a normal person and not degrade other people in the youtube comment section kappa"
CmRih_VtVAs,"its lit.
this trailer is stellar.
great use of queen!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is dc comics going down acid trip motherfucking lane!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"We're bad guys, it's what we do!

Summed up the Suicide Squad right there"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why isn't this trending but some other stupid stuff are trending!?!?!!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody tits and high-quality action ? I'll see this movie thrice.
CmRih_VtVAs,what song is this ?
CmRih_VtVAs,yikes
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh shit, that looks fucking great :D I'm excited as fuck!"
CmRih_VtVAs,And this just ruined it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait. They're villains assembled to... fight evil? Or just take out the Joker? IDGI
CmRih_VtVAs,I went from interested to fucking stoked in 2 minutes and 31 seconds.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, does Katana secretly work for Batman?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know why but this reminds me of ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"" somehow :D
still a great trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks horrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,honestly liked the comic con trailer better but of seeing Jared more here just raised more hype. This trailer has made the movie look comic w the music n not dark n gritty as it suppose to. Now I'm not so sure the movie will be as good as the hype it created 1st place. But I'll only watch it for Jared he  seems to nail this joker!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"eghhh, I feel like most the people here are just on the Band Wagon, and likely have never picked up a S.S. Comic in their life. but after seeing it will act like they're hardcore fans."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn and Joker are just wow 0.0
CmRih_VtVAs,I think that groot looking thing tearing up the subway at 1:45 is what they're after. At least it looks like it
CmRih_VtVAs,Well....now I'm fucking sold.
CmRih_VtVAs,This might be DC's ant-man :D (It was barley known but makes a good movie anyway)
CmRih_VtVAs,"i am so fucking ready for this film
its going to be awesome i kno it
joker made me jizz my pants, so excited"
CmRih_VtVAs,One thing for certain DC has better than Marvel - Villains!
CmRih_VtVAs,now i can proudly say MARVEL IS A FUCKINGGG PUSSY :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,is the green water with Joker & Harley Lazarus pit?
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddy would roll over in his grave if he knew that they synced one of the best classic rock songs with this shit. BTW it does work.....so FUCK FREDDY!!! This Rocks his and my dick!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know what to think about Jay Courtney.
CmRih_VtVAs,"WB, you made a mistake 
Now correct that Mistake by  Hiring David Ayer as The  director   of Justice League Part 1 & 2"
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst ... Music-Pause ... Ever :D
CmRih_VtVAs,What is that huge green thing blasting through the train at 1:43? That's gotta be the villain but anyone know the name?
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone spotted enchanterss with all the gang? in any of the trailers?
CmRih_VtVAs,SUICIDE SQUAD WILL BREAK RECORDS I BELIEVE THAT AND 2ND WILL BE THE BATMAN V SUPERMAN OR CIVIL WAR IM A PURE DC FAN BUT DAMN I CANT RATE CIVIL WAR AS 2ND HAHAHAHA! The scene when Joker dived to the acid to save Harley was  fucking so lovely and epic!! <3 I believe all the theory now on Joker is 0% accurate i believe the Joker of Leto is the real Joker nothing else while what happened to Todd is different and not yet to be scene maybe in a new Batman movie together with this universe SQ and Justice League and other upcoming DC movies!! El diablo is cool i am somehow curious what happened to the eyes of Katana is she possessed by Enchantress or adrenaline shots or something.. and who is the real enemy here? Enchantress? I can see soldiers and somehow slipknot covered in something black like alien armor + who is the one like destroying the train there? and some crazy long alien like tentacles it is like Enchantress went mad here
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Thank me later
CmRih_VtVAs,i love how im watching this trailer and i have no idea wtf is going on in the plot other than shit is going down instead of batman and super practically showing me the ending in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"you know what? 
I'm just going to watch it again...
#saysitall"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just feel like Tom Hardy would have been alot better than Joel Kinnaman
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh My God. > screams like a fan girl <
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer feels more like they're making a parody movie for a joke.. which hopefully it will be anything but
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this will be an r rated movie. It will suck if kids are allowed to see this
CmRih_VtVAs,"When it released, just consider watching this movie as a suicide attempt. Might be the best suicide. Otherwise just normal suicide."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please, please, PLEASE don't fuck this up Jai Courtney!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,god so much hate on here just go watch your Disney films kids
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody <3 \m/
CmRih_VtVAs,"ooh I like this trailer this might finally be a decent DC Movie since The Dark Knight, .... also this really reminds me of guardians of the galaxy trailer for some reason"
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's with that shot of the Joker surrounded by all the neatly arranged knives and guns and whatnot? Nevermind the dumb look they gave him, I'm over that, it's whatever... but what's up with that shot? Why? How? Did he neatly lay it all out like that so he could get down and do snow angels in the middle of it?

There better be a good god damn reason for that shit. I always hate shots like that because they're so CLEARLY orchestrated by the director just to look neat. Takes me out of the experience. There's no good reason for stuff to be laid out like that..."
CmRih_VtVAs,That looks like garbage.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn dies cofirmed?
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain America 0:54?
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto still looks retarded.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn tho
CmRih_VtVAs,Comic con trailer was better. This trailer and the song isnt fitting
CmRih_VtVAs,well I'm officially on board
CmRih_VtVAs,possibly going to be the best comic comic book movie this year.
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST. FREAKING. TRAILER. EVER!!! :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fucking shit !
CmRih_VtVAs,Aaaaaaaaaaaaàaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ooooooohhhh myyyyyyyyyy ggooooooooooooooddďddddddd
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the first time that I've ever said this but, I actually think I'm really going to enjoy Jai Courtney's performance."
CmRih_VtVAs,This will be great cooler than the nutella and that I love very much the nutella
CmRih_VtVAs,найкращий трейлер який я бачив в житті!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Meh, Killer Croc is almost the shortest of the punch :("
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 who is that?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hyperventilating.
I haven't even started the video yet because I'm loading it in HD but,
Hyperventilating."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07..   dayum
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a feeling sometime during the movie, when joker encounters batman, it will set the stage for the solo batman film which I hope sets under the red hood"
CmRih_VtVAs,Seven months is just too much
CmRih_VtVAs,"The song in the Star Trek trailer, the song in this trailer, who the fuck chose these kind of songs? It seriously ruined the tone of the movie and our hype for this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so so normal comment but I CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,All aboard the hype train!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best Supporting Actrees Oscar 2016 (Oscar 2017) = Margot Robbie..
CmRih_VtVAs,Loving this new version of the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,1:38 cue the music
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto Leto Leto... YES !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,yuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this is one of the most epic trailer I've ever seen. So nice the scene where the Joker fall to save Harley. And of course everything is mixed up so well with Bohemian Rhapsody. GREAT JOB
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is BATMAN???!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,It's.... It's beautiful.
CmRih_VtVAs,"wayne's world!
wayne's world!
party time !
excellent!"
CmRih_VtVAs,epic
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's the BAT
CmRih_VtVAs,wow... this looks pretty awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Good ol' Queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly think that this movie looks like one of the more faithful adaptions from the comics, they understood what the core of the Suicide Squad related comics was.
I just really hope this will be rated R"
CmRih_VtVAs,"without a doubt the second worst DC movie, first one being batman trilogy"
CmRih_VtVAs,Very different contrast to the first trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker and that girl with colored ponytail is the best part of this movie.. i will watch it for them. sexy sexy Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy....
Bohemian Rhapsody :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,THATS WAS FREAKING AWSOME!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought DC was going full dark on this movie. Probably don't and that's nice.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like a crappy fan made trailer with over the top campy references.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who likes to see BOTH good Marvel AND DC films, and just enjoy comics in general? Why fanboys always fighting like little kids? This comments section is sad, really...people joining clans in video games, comic books, etc. just like religion"
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOME!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,looks fine
CmRih_VtVAs,"""put Jared Leto joker comment"""
CmRih_VtVAs,turkler burdamı olma cok iyi lan 😀
CmRih_VtVAs,"So many bullets, but even one drop of blood ...."
CmRih_VtVAs,Hmm DC trying to make a movie with multiple anti heroes that we won't give a f*ck about most of the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,cade os br? huashauhsah
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pls guys, WB, hear me, PLS! NO MORE SUICIDE SQUAD TRAILERS, OK? I already lost interest in BvS, don't ruin Suicide Squad for me also..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This feels sooooo right!!!! Fuck marvel's lighthearted, cartoony crap!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"FINALLY A DC MOVIE WORTH MY FUCKING MONEY EXCEPT THAT FUCKING ""DAWN OF JUSTICE"" BULLSHIT. FUCKING SHOWING ALMOST EVERYTHING FROM THE MOVIE BULLSHIT."
CmRih_VtVAs,That was the worst song choice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"text *WORST* came up and that chopper scene haha
All i was thinkin ""Yea, movie doesnt lie, worst CGI 2016"" haha"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks like he's having a fucking blast
CmRih_VtVAs,what's the song in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:08 Margot looks like Emilie Autumn
Love them both!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The producers and editors were tripping balls when I made this one. Too much mescaline
CmRih_VtVAs,"and thats another Queen song ruined by popculture, first Radio Gaga and now Freddie's Magnum Opus...

Fuck you world!"
CmRih_VtVAs,first fail in 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Who / what are they fighting against?
CmRih_VtVAs,COOLEST TRAILER EVER! At least for this year...
CmRih_VtVAs,First Trailer---->M.U.C.H. better
CmRih_VtVAs,how many teens just found out who freddy mercury was
CmRih_VtVAs,"Way to go, DC!  Wow!  I am psyched as hell for this!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"No a fan of DC comics, but Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody pretty suites this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks really tight, but come on with everyone trying to be like guardians with classic rock scores for trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shit did anyone notice the thing that stretches its arm on the train!!! that has to be clayface!! no doubt unless groot decided to switch over to dc xD
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 so is joker doing this to get harly quin?
CmRih_VtVAs,The best thing about this trailer is Queen soundtrack and Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Pause at 2:08. You're welcome
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm heavily reminded of Castor Troy the more I see Leto's Joker.......which is great.
CmRih_VtVAs,DAT ASS DOE.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody what a song
CmRih_VtVAs,I love love love it. I'm glad they revealed more of the joker too. I can't wait to see the actual movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,I want more Joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,Not getting my hopes up for this....
CmRih_VtVAs,So.... not gonna lie this is probably the most impressive thing DC has come out with in... well... forever.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how we have no idea what the heck it is they're gonna fight
CmRih_VtVAs,"Leto playing as the Joker is just screaming this, ""I'm bored. Want to see my toys?""

Will be expecting this to be good."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't handle all this EDGE
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm crying. This is absolutely wonderful 😭🙌
CmRih_VtVAs,Jizzed in my pants
CmRih_VtVAs,this send shivers down my spine
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Let's go save the world."" - said Will Smith in every movie he's ever been in."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What we really need, are MORE sub par comic book movies & reboots.""

- every Hollywood executive"
CmRih_VtVAs,Song:Bohemian Rhapsody-Queen (Wow you dont really know this song)
CmRih_VtVAs,1:07 secret on the left
CmRih_VtVAs,I just creamed my pants.
CmRih_VtVAs,"really, Queen? its 2016 
stop with the old music.
didnt even go well with the footage, and the ""model"" with the wide nose and muslim thickass eyebrows had to ruin the video, while you are added add kim kardashian then
yo and the harley queen acting sucks ass.

the only thing that was awesome was the joker. i aint watching this shit, this is sooo fucking cringing"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer compared to the other has cheapened the film. Bohemian Rhapsody shouldn't of been used as the music..
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie in my opinion shouldn't be compared to avengers or civil war

instead I would compare this to guardians of the galaxy or black panther movie that will come soon"
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"500,000 views and 100,000 of them are mine.  *Replay* *Replay* *Replay* *Replay* *Replay*"
CmRih_VtVAs,It would be so great if this movie were to be rated R.
CmRih_VtVAs,"For Some reasons, i jizzed myself"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't get what this film is going for, the first trailer was all serious like the dark knight and now this trailer makes it look like a comedy lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,"With Will Smith in this movie, it would normally be time to boycott, however this trailer is too damn awesome!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Someone launch a petition to make this rated- R, please !"
CmRih_VtVAs,"@ Zack Snyder, this is how you make an Epic trailer for a DC film without ruining the plot"
CmRih_VtVAs,Weird how this is such a contrast from the Comic-con trailer's much darker & sadder tone.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man, I hope the movie is as totally kick-ass as these trailers.  I freakin' LOVE these Suicide Squad trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,wow this is one of the very few trailers that actually got me hyped for the actual movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm dying omggggg 😍😍😍😍😍 can't waitttttttt
CmRih_VtVAs,Lmao I'm dyin when captain boomerang came out swanggin on the cop LMAO!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 tho
CmRih_VtVAs,SO MUCH HYPEEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,LOVE <333
CmRih_VtVAs,the Joker look like he on Crack lol
CmRih_VtVAs,2:20 what is reald 3D
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that's how you make a fucking trailer ! not like that shit Batman V Superman newest trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the film I'm most looking forward to see in 2016!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer and best song ever combined wow
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, the last trailer is better."
CmRih_VtVAs,AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO'S SINGING THROUGHOUT THE TRAILER????
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody for those who wants the song
CmRih_VtVAs,THAT OOOOOOHHH WHEN THE JOKER DOES THAT DIVE WAS PERFECT I CANT STOP REPLAYING THAT BIT.
CmRih_VtVAs,where is batman??!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Plz sh*t up and take my money!!!!11
CmRih_VtVAs,Wants to be Guardians of the Galaxy so bad!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is far beyond one of the best trailers ive seen so far! good job to the person who edited this trailer and not showing too much! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,So is the Joker the villain of the movie or is he only going to be in flashbacks?
CmRih_VtVAs,"wish they made b v s and man of steel this fun too!
this thing looks fantastic!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"THE JOKER : Marvel, we gonna hurt you REAALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY BAAAAAAAAD !!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The crazies are coming, the crazies are coming........"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith ruins it for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,David Ayer was the perfect man to hire for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08. Best part of the best parts of THE BEST FUCKING TRAILER EVER.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Song fits perfectly.
CmRih_VtVAs,the style and atmosphere of that trailer is magnificent
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker looks like a wanna be 2pac with slugz in his mouth, a fake thug. and Harley quin just doesn't seem like Harley quin. ima watch it but I don't think I'll like a whole lot tho. oh well."
CmRih_VtVAs,Not been so hyped for a film in a long time!
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailer was pretty good...but it really goes a long way when you pick such a great song from such a wonderful group of people.
CmRih_VtVAs,1300+ dislikes... That's alot of Marvel hate! haha jk... That's not what the voices said! ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh Crap..Don't let joker so bad..
CmRih_VtVAs,is this just a fantasy
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the most try-hard movie trailer I've ever seen, it wants to be Guardians of the Galaxy so badly but just fails to capture it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm in love with arlequina, omg she's so perfect"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks alright
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is what Star Trek Beyond wanted to do but failed miserably. 
It looks awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 I can relate to that
CmRih_VtVAs,queen- bohemian rhapsody~
CmRih_VtVAs,World's best villain joker is back with harley quinn and many other bad bat  villains. So worst heroes ever best movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,This maybe the best DC trailer ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie is stupid. not the worst movie ever, surely, but its going to definitely be your standard boilerplate piece of hollywood dook."
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST!
CmRih_VtVAs,Look's awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,what do they say at the last part??
CmRih_VtVAs,They had a psycologist on set at all times just incase one of the actors lost their minds while filming... True story
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone call 911 DC just brutally murdered Marvel in front of my eyes.
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie could be a major hit. Remember nobody saw the guardians of the galaxy coming and that was one of Marvel's top grossing films
CmRih_VtVAs,wtf Joker very bad it s look cosplay
CmRih_VtVAs,OMH I CAN'T WAIT OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,We're bad guys is what we do *rolls eyes*
CmRih_VtVAs,Do you people know how far August is?? I might not make it that far. Can y'all just release it next month? 😕😬😂😂😏🙈🙈🙈
CmRih_VtVAs,"0.10 Is she read ""The Legend Of Tarzan""?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm looking forward to seeing Harley Quinn. I hope she plays her right
CmRih_VtVAs,movie is going to suck
CmRih_VtVAs,The gods have blessed us this day
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk how I feel about this trailer but I do know that Jared Leto looks fuckin sick as the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn the trailer's awesome,usually dc trailer always gloomy"
CmRih_VtVAs,WHY DOES DEADSHOT HAS THE THING IN THE WRONG EYE?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody? Wow, they know how to get me to drag myself to the cinema."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Star Wars hype < Suicide Squad hype 

This movie is going to be insanely good"
CmRih_VtVAs,Song by Queen makes this trailer even more Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Tell me..will they bleed?
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that Cara develijfandnge..??
CmRih_VtVAs,omg
CmRih_VtVAs,Sweet Jesus Christ Almighty is this out yet?! Damn it! I can only get so erect!
CmRih_VtVAs,is it me or this looks better than batman vs superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not ready for this!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Only thing I don't like about it is slip knot
CmRih_VtVAs,The editor of this trailer should've edited the last Batman V Superman trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Already looks a billion times better than that batman vs superman garbage. I'm actually extremely excited for this
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats the song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,This fucking better not end up a pg-13 movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not even kidding, this is probably the best trailer I've seen in a while!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love how DC and Warner are like yes ""super hero movies are still fun""... And still getting some serious Guardians vibe from this"
CmRih_VtVAs,PERFECT.
CmRih_VtVAs,looks hype
CmRih_VtVAs,omfg
CmRih_VtVAs,Very apt background score to the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"don't wanna be negative, because the trailer is awesome, and the film looks great for the most part; but I really hate everything I've seen of Leto's joker so far. The look, the performance, even the lines. And this is coming from a long term fan of Batman/Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Quite a tonal change compared to the bland and boring first trailer. This actually looks quite interesting, might even end up being really good aside from Will Smith being in it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's a split second kind of scene but if you pause it right at 1:52, i believe that the joker is the one inside the green robotic suit! JUST LOOK AT THE FACE!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Tom Hardy made a smart decision dropping out of this for the Revenant
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer of the year in January? Nice job.
CmRih_VtVAs,Trailer of the year in January? Nice job.
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCKIN EPIC
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how Queens lyrics for BEËLZEBUB (yknow, the devil) comes up just when The Joker pops onto screen.
The editing is amazing in this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,this is fake batman would have apprehend all of them within 24hours
CmRih_VtVAs,Great song!
CmRih_VtVAs,I SERIOUSLY CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"YES D.C!!!! I can't fucking believe it, you may actually have put together something interesting here.  This movie is going to destroy Batman V Superman on so many levels."
CmRih_VtVAs,"the joker is impressive, probably will be the highlight of the movie, I would love if they went with this kind of cheesy/creepy tune, reminds me of the old animated series, I just hope they change Harley quins design cause I just cant swallow it..."
CmRih_VtVAs,For the first time Joker looks sexy than anyone
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's joker looks totally insane.
CmRih_VtVAs,batman cameo is required 😊
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks boring as fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley reaching for that purse thooo 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman is on vacation?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the villain in a film based on villains
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so edgy lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,Killer croc vs wannabe doomsday? Who's more stupid Looking from both trailers?
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that a trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v Superman should have this movie's visual effects. But still, Everything cool DC!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking better than Batman v Superman already
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now dc hav a huge strick back, watch out marvel"
CmRih_VtVAs,Morgot Robbie <3 She is soooo amazinggg !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,CARALHO que foda...
CmRih_VtVAs,I guess we're finally having a good DC movie that isn't from TDK Trilogy!
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever edited this trailer should've done that last Batman V Superman Trailer. Then it wouldn't have sucked so much.
CmRih_VtVAs,this is an epic motherfukcing trailer!! Its DC's turn to give us a superhero film with class
CmRih_VtVAs,"If the movie is 1/10th as good as this Trailer, I'll be stoked."
CmRih_VtVAs,Да!
CmRih_VtVAs,These Marvel movies get better and better. I liked the fact they had a Beatles song in this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Fanboys are coming...
CmRih_VtVAs,That ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like the ""dark feel"" which this trailer has about the characters. My only fear is that we'll see these characters as ""good guys"" by the end of the movie, having redeemed themselves during the movie or something. This must not happen as these are supposed to be really, really, really bad people. The comic book versions of most of these characters would gladly commit murder without so much as flinch. Now that is what I hope these characters will offer - That while they are doing ""good"", one should not mistake them for a hero. We should constantly be reminded during the film that these guys have no sense (or very little) of remorse or soul for that matter. That line which Will Smith says ""Let's go save the world"" has me doubting that the directors will stick to the true nature of these characters."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto makes a very good Jason tod..... I mean joker hehehehe my bad 😉😅
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have a two things.

One. Listening Old Quren Song Again.

Two. No words to describe its sheer feelings. 

Thats all"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for this! The one thing that got me was Leto's laugh. Damn...
CmRih_VtVAs,This has the Guardians of the Galaxy vibe all over it... I like it already!
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is batman ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"What's with all this praise? Did I see even see the same trailer?    Sure, it looks like it will have fun action but I'm not really convinced about any of these villians.    Will Smith is Will Smith, Harley sounds like shes a perfectly sane person trying to hard to convince people shes crazy, and Leto is just a psychotic creepy douche bag and not funny at all."
CmRih_VtVAs,"harley quinn felt a bit over acted on this trailer, hope I'm wrong. but everything else looks awesome, way more excited for this than bvs"
CmRih_VtVAs,IM FUCKING PISSING MYSELF LOOK AT THE COLORS OF THE WORDS THEYRE SO PRETTY AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS SO GOOD AAAAAAHH
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my favorite thing ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,rest in peace Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,My God!!! This trailer makes my day...That Colors is The Colors of Joy in Evil..
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys"" (slap slap slap)"". That's all I needed to see/hear to believe in Leto's joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Aw man, August? Well at least Batfleck vs Superman is on sooner than that."
CmRih_VtVAs,I have Goosebumps
CmRih_VtVAs,"8 MONTHS IS ENOUGH TIME 
TO FIND A JOB
#BLESSED"
CmRih_VtVAs,I came so fucking hard!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS GOING TO BE FUCKING AWESOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Perfect trailer. Ironic, sarcastic, colorful, bursting with character and funny. Can't wait for this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,so Joker jumps into acid or bleach to save Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker is not funny in this film
CmRih_VtVAs,"nice songs, match with the actions"
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS GOT ME SO PUMPED!!! I HAD TO DO A KICK-ASS REACTION!!!  :D TRAILER EDITOR FTW!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"marvel have 'CA civil war' i waiting for deadpool

dc have batman v superman
i waiting for suicide squad
love this trailer <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully deadpool kills it at the box office and these studios realize that making an R rated superhero flick is a good idea. Then maybe Suicide Squad 2 will be R rated and dark as fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,"brilliant, just brilliant, loved the song choice and it looks like it will be incredible to watch."
CmRih_VtVAs,best use of bohemian rhaspody
CmRih_VtVAs,"who is that screaming guy in the begining? looks like tom hardy, sounds like when he was in bronson xD"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is nothing without the joker
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 most iconic moment
CmRih_VtVAs,The tone of this trailer is miles away from the first look we had. I'm hoping that was deliberate to convey the duality of these characters and the sheer craziness of the situation in which they find themselves.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best trailer iv seen this entire year ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Hurry up August I need to see it now
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Harley's jersey accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like Marvels Gaurdians of The Galaxy  with the old music and the bad guys becoming heroes
CmRih_VtVAs,"Screw BvS, this I must see!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is so LEGENDARY!

Moment of silence for the doubters of Leto!
Remember they said the same thing about Heath! So much backlash/hate and turned out to be one of greatest portrayals ever!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Had to stop the trailer at the beginning bc I thought I was hearing things. Song goes so well!
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO HYPE RIGHT NOW AT 1 IN THE MORNING I CANT WAIT!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,They couldn't get a good actress for Harley huh..
CmRih_VtVAs,is that permaclown at 1:57
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:20 it looks like Joker is torturing Jason Todd
CmRih_VtVAs,Also epic trailer. And people argue that DC is colorless.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody brings this trailer into whole new level
CmRih_VtVAs,"Haha, really this trailer is magnificent"
CmRih_VtVAs,Views counter froze lmao.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this was awesome....but i wish the music was better....
this might be the equivalent to guardians of the galaxy!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Sound?
CmRih_VtVAs,what no batman cameo?
CmRih_VtVAs,1K dislikes from crying marveliebers
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Harley taking the necklace at the end an homage to High Noon?
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG this one of the best trailers ever. Please DC don't toy with my feelings. I hope this is not just an amazing trailer for a bad movie; that would break my heart.
CmRih_VtVAs,Im sorry but i honestly think this is gonna run circles around civil war
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm loving it!
CmRih_VtVAs,"cant get enough of this trailer man... wish they added more joker but then it would ruin it, oh well im sold on this movie already...:,)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Much better than the first trailer, kudos.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now I'm more excited for this than BvS. Man, I see Margot winning an Oscar for the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I prefer this over the previous trailer. Has more personality in it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I was a suicide squad fan before it was cool to be a suicide squad fan! Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,"She's got no ass. 
Pass."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn has always been my favorite female super villain, if not my favorite super villain period. I'm really skeptical that Margot Robbie will do her justice... :("
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was already looking forward to this, then they included Queen as the soundtrack to the trailer...........................I'm sold on this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"they pulled no punches with this movie, it's gona be great"
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who wants to see this more than BvS ? :p
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else is laughing evilly while watcjing this?
CmRih_VtVAs,August come fast
CmRih_VtVAs,"So this is basically The Dirty Dozen, with somewhat more far-fetched characters?
OK, I'm in."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC ALL THE WAY!
CmRih_VtVAs,Do them proud Jared
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,touching myself to this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Funniest trailer ever, so hyped for the movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh. Batman vs Superman please
CmRih_VtVAs,"that trailer was shit sorry, boring as fuck! just  no style to it at all just another expendables for the dumbed down C.O.D playing kids of today"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am sorry, but the song is so powerful that my brain only sees Freddie rocking and cannot see the actual video."
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad > BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"A queen song for this trailer was not the right choice, I will watch this movie, but I am skeptical."
CmRih_VtVAs,The music fits so perfectly! Incredible
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn shouldn't have more screen time than The Joker no matter how hot she is.

Looks like a silly fun action movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,CAN'T WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,only DC does comic book villains right
CmRih_VtVAs,is that deadpool trailer or Suicide Squad ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Holyshit dats good
CmRih_VtVAs,I love queen but why does the joker look so fancy??? too much purple...hahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope most of them survive. Assault on Arkham killed most of them.
CmRih_VtVAs,yup watched it 35 times its going to be better then batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Good trailer, bad movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Please don't suck.
CmRih_VtVAs,This look amazing and much better than Batman V Superman :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man this looks fuckin epic. I'm actually really excited for the new Joker too, he looks pretty sick so far!"
CmRih_VtVAs,hmm watchmen?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why do I torture myself by reading youtube comments, what's wrong with you people?"
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,The song fucking made it better. The gunshots really made it look like a remix holy fuck this trailer is epic. I hope the movie can can be better than this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Whats the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Damnnnn
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK YES!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""oh yeah I definitely prefer DC to fucking Marvel because DC makes movies for grown ups""
movie looks just like Guardians of the Galaxy, with a few bullets and teeth."
CmRih_VtVAs,I absolutely l<3ve Harley :3
CmRih_VtVAs,damn that ass in the end
CmRih_VtVAs,"First of all , that was so fucking awesome . Second , what's the song called ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Why i cant wait for suicide squad. And it looks fucking awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,the trailer is great! really great! I just can't seem to appreciate harley's voice though. maybe I'm just used to the harley quinn in video games. But it's great!
CmRih_VtVAs,**insert Neo Woah meme here**
CmRih_VtVAs,"Tears me up. I don't know if I want to be interested in watching this...

Leto-Joker is on point with characteristics but, the visual..just not for it...What they've made visually for Joker is unappealing. I'm all for breaking the mold but, what in the hell?? along with Harley Quinn just poor choice to stray way off for the sake of being something different..

I want to like this movie but...Just ehh

The feel that this is gonna link up with BvS is definitely here, especially in this trailer...Just wish it was in an entire different section so it gets forgotten about, I really don't want to deal with the Jokers visual moving forward after this. Granted I'm even tired of the Joker always being the headlined villian for Batman but their are definitely better choices to choice from.."
CmRih_VtVAs,where was this editor for this trailer when they made the batman v superman trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,I completely love this scene 1:57
CmRih_VtVAs,Most anticipated movie hands down.
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC, you should have sold tickets and show this trailer on cinemas. 
srsly. This is a masterpiece."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait what where is batman??????
CmRih_VtVAs,seru nih kya'y 😱
CmRih_VtVAs,seru nih kya'y 😱
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN for the win!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Caraaaa ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,They had me nabbed the moment Margot Robbie would be Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"""WTF they showed us the deal, now we know what the movie about and that's Joker has new toys, going somewhere bad to do something dangerously and the Joker gonna be involved "" ... anyone want to bitch around here. I created this stupid topics so you can use it and try to created new things to hate this movie here, like a stand alone movie for the bad guys maybe?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"THIS is more like it. After the teaser, I wasn't sure they had enough of a sense of humour to make his work. It feels good to be wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why isnt Harley wearing any pants?
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel sorry for the DC fanboys. This was a total pile of shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""The joker & harley quinn The movie """
CmRih_VtVAs,Is there a Oscar for editing trailers? Because this guy deserves it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I guess im the only one that thought Bohemian Rhapsody did NOT fit in this trailer, maybe because I love the song too much and seeing it cut up like this made it seem really bad. Ah well, The film footage looks great though."
CmRih_VtVAs,why does Harley not  have her Brooklyn betty boop accent.. that's one of her things that makes her..Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG This looks amazing, great trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,SONGS ???? :c
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how they used Kanye West's song for this movie! Pure gold!
CmRih_VtVAs,well this got me out of my funk. Now I wanna rock out to Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Straight up gave me chills. This looks so good.
CmRih_VtVAs,"O.O The mother of all trailers O.O 
Wow warner, I Am not a fanboy but this trailer is epic, congratulations to the editors of the video"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"""The voices!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer I'm pretty sure this movie is going to be the best
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shit this looks incredible
CmRih_VtVAs,I've been excited since the rumors for this movie came out and with every new piece of info and trailer I get more excited. I'm going to explode.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Wahjah
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing trailer. Hopefully they don't make the mistake they did with BvS and reveal a huge spoiler in the next trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that's what am talking about !!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,My cock is ready!
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel that's how you deal with comedy. DC IS HERE TO FUCKING PLAY.
CmRih_VtVAs,which is that song it is really awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer just owns the batman vs superman trailer in every way... I'M SO HYPED!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can we just all agree on calling the panda ""Pew Pew Panda""?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad: Dawn of the Jainaissance.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this just fantasy
CmRih_VtVAs,fookn mint 👌
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why it seems that all these jokes in the recent DC trailers fall flat for me? Like seriously is there something wrong with me or can't they just make good jokes. 

I'm not hating DC, I liked Man of Steel and I'm waiting to see these two movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLYYYYYYYY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Intense Guardians of the Galaxy feel from this. Welp, now I know anti hero movie have the best music!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker's seems to be 10X crazier in this movie. Anyway does anyone knows who's that character at 1:43 destroying the train?
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked the previous teaser more !!! Darker .... Better ??
CmRih_VtVAs,"question @ 1:52 who is that? I don't know anything about the comics but some say it's  Brainiac. I sure hope it's not because I would  rather Brainiac be a very important villian in a later DC movie, possible an upcoming villian for the justice league movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok,why is this video stuck at 499092 views???"
CmRih_VtVAs,this better not end up PG-13 or someshit... it's a team of the worst phsycopaths ever on a suicide mission  if you wanna take your kids to such movie maybe you should start paying for a therapist and learn about being a better parent damn it !!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:13 She's strangely adorable
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice Ass 2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like Scott Eastwood is playing a redshirt....again.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have no idea what this movie is going to be like, but this trailer is insanely good."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well some of my fears about this movie are now gone. Is it wrong for me to say I think this movie is going to be way better than BvS? Oh what the hell, it is. lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know anything on what mission this is? Im very curious if its gonna be comic related or its own new story
CmRih_VtVAs,"0/10 
Trailer not directed by Hideo Kojima"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney looks like a broke Tom hardy.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so excited to watch this ahhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wanted this movie to have a darker atmosphere , not cheesy one liners  and Queen playing in the back ground ."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm starting to care more about this movie then I do, Batman Vs. Superman Dawn of Justice.After seeing this trailer, why is that?lol, could it be this looks fucking amazing lol.Yes I think so lol.I can't wait for this shit, amazing trailer, lol just saying."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:05
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 that is Poison Ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,this was F.....ING AWESOOOOOOMEEEEE!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why am i Not in this movie ???
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is going to own this. This is JUST a trailer but everything about his portrayal of the Joker is brilliant. Fuck the haters.
CmRih_VtVAs,oh god
CmRih_VtVAs,This was kinda deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well ladies and gentlemen, here you have it; a REAL DC movie. Color, humor, insanity, excitement, this is everything that I have wanted from a DC movie for years. Fuck, this is going to be a great film!"
CmRih_VtVAs,seriously it gave me the chills!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best comic book movie trailer of this generation. I am so hyped. Damn it, David Ayer and the rest of Warner Bros, whatever amount you paid to Queen to use Bohemian Rhapsody is fucking worth it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,now i feel like Batman is the only clown in a costume in this DCCU
CmRih_VtVAs,where is batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,"MaMA MiYa MaMa MiYa - Ready for #TheNewJOke & Start of #DCUniverse.
Best Trailer with Best Sound track in The World. IMAX 3D -First Show Lets Do THIS"
CmRih_VtVAs,wow it trailler gonna make you crazyyyyyyyyyyyy
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. This trailer is a freaking masterpiece. Got me 100% more excited about this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG MARGOT YOU CAN'T BE STOPPED.
CmRih_VtVAs,is Hans zimmer the music composer of this movie ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"With regards to Harley's missing accent, I guess it's possible that Robbie just couldn't pull it off.  I mean, it's not like she's ever been in an enormously successful, Oscar nominated movie where she's always used that accent perfectly, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Zack snyder and David Ayer take MY MONEEEYYY!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""i can't wait to show you my toys."" fuck! this sentence! omg"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie a goddess
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool or Suicide Squad or Civil War or BVS what to choose
CmRih_VtVAs,"dear hollywood: STOP TRYING TO MAKE JAI COURTNEY WORK! SERIOUSLY, HE IS LIKE THE NEW SAM WORTHINGTON, B LIST ACTING BEING CAST IN A-LIST MOVIES FOR NO REASON"
CmRih_VtVAs,cool amazing😖😖
CmRih_VtVAs,499062 xD
CmRih_VtVAs,Мне одному не понравилось ? I am one who does not like it?
CmRih_VtVAs,Paused at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this pg-13 or rated R?
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys."" I think Jared Leto will be a great Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ooh, this is gonna be good! >8D"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm holding my breathe until I actually see it. I have mixed impressions about it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"more I'm seeing of Jared Leto's Joker , the less excited I get about his role. Also song choice is okay , I mean Queen in anything is practically good ."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35-1:38 wtf? lol
CmRih_VtVAs,eh... this one's... not for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Adding a classic won't make the trailer better.
CmRih_VtVAs,HELL YEAH!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry, the trailer is good and all but I just can't focus on it. I'm too busy singing to Bohemian Rhapsody."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, Harley Quinn. I love that crazy bitch."
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of the song??? Poss answer....
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer got me so hyped *_*
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:50 i liked the costume...then she spoke and that was the least convincing acting, pls dont let that be final dialogue"
CmRih_VtVAs,When they used Bohemian Rhapsody I was already hooked.
CmRih_VtVAs,That Harley booty tho
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Mmmmmm
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel studios....here comes your doomsday!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"dam son, movies are getting badass these days. ITS A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel studios....here comes your doomsday!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am no longer on the fence about Leto's Joker. The little more we see of him in this trailer looks fantastic. It's different enough to be its own version, and he looks like a clown bag of murderous fun!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Still not quite convinced by it... but who knows?
CmRih_VtVAs,I came so hard!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,now *THAT* is how you make a trailer!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,cool
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is gonna suck so bad
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy Shit !!!! This is beyond epic. What are they eating at WB and DC?
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't make up my mind what'll be worse this or BvS?
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh my gosh, if they bring in all the villains and superheroes and they have this battle, that would be beyond cool"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking forward to watching this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Goodbye Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Literally just edgy guardians. i pass.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody was Perfect for this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever.This will probbably replace guardians of the galaxy for me
CmRih_VtVAs,so nice
CmRih_VtVAs,this is going to be fun
CmRih_VtVAs,"POTA QUE PARIU QUE TRAILER FOI ESSE, MUITO LOUCO"
CmRih_VtVAs,I Cannot WAIT For This!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think DC actually, finally made a good Bad Ass movie !! :O lol I really enjoyed it, and looking forward to seeing this movie !!!!!!! lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly if Suicide squad beats the Bat vs SM in the box office? Ohh gosh
CmRih_VtVAs,"time to get.....--CRAZY!!!!! OwO
xD
mfahahahaha.
(;"
CmRih_VtVAs,cara omg
CmRih_VtVAs,Saw this shit 5 times already :D
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like end sequence is joker and Harley trying to escape and batman going after them.
DC in my opinion is so different from comic book movies that have come out I'm excited. There's consequences and if you want comic movies to evolve is to not be a comic book movie but be a drama, a thriller, comedy, suspense, and make a good movie. Go Marvel Go DC."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Se ven muy falsos los golpes, Joker parece que sólo quiere enseñar su ""grill"", la loca no se ve tan loca como esperaba. Buenos efectos."
CmRih_VtVAs,Even Jai Courtney looks good in this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is, quite possibly, the best movie trailer I've ever seen."
CmRih_VtVAs,cool :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is the best thing that has come out from the new DC movie universe
CmRih_VtVAs,Dissapointed......
CmRih_VtVAs,It kinda looks like they're going the comedy route. It should be more deeper than that.
CmRih_VtVAs,I am Groot
CmRih_VtVAs,Groot is the villain
CmRih_VtVAs,"Killer crock....Yeah, that's a killer crock alright. He looks like dooms day on meth."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Что-то не впечатлило. Возможно, стоило использовать другую музыку. Более эпичную. Так бы трейлер возможно и зашёл."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,cant stop watching xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wasn't looking forward to this, but now I'm intrigued"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So Scott Eastwood is playing a young and not evil deathstroke or who is he playing? He had a couple of scenes in the trailer, he might be important."
CmRih_VtVAs,Im watching this movie because of Bohemian rhapsody... #Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,yeah dc is way too dark... hahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,Song choice is on point.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 - is the joker thinking the mannequin is harley and saving it?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have never been a fan of Jared Leto but having said that, and having such a hard act to follow from heath Ledger, I love his Joker. Even though it's as far removed from any Joker we've seen on screen yet, his personality and madness is instantly recognisable! The great thing about the Joker is that he's so likable and translatable from comics to the big screen. You can play him many different ways but you'll never say ""Oh who's he?! He looks like an interesting character"" I'd say every actor would love to have a crack at playing him. One of the most interesting character ever!! Whether that's on screen or in the comics."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevinge and Margo Robbie are going to be great in this
CmRih_VtVAs,Margo Robbie is perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh yeah, and boomerang is just nuts"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not bad at least it isn't going to be a super uber serious movie like I thought. I just hope Scott Eastwood is playing an undercover Dick Grayson, seriously look at him and tell me you don't see Grayson a little bit."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yup, just jizzed in my pants"
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Fuckin Mercury!
CmRih_VtVAs,"So Harley, no jersey/ny accent?"
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one who hated the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow......just wow!!! Cant wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Ech
CmRih_VtVAs,deadshot: cool.    harley quinn: direct and badass representation of the new 52 H Q       killer croc: cool        el diablo: don't know enough about the character to judge        enchantress: same with el diablo       rick flag: cool           amanda waller: yes. just yes.                the joker: he is gonna be right up there with heath ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is going to be the star of this thing and I AM SO HERE FOR IT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Even as Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie is still smoking hot!!! OHHH and 2016 is going to be the greatest fucking year ever!!!! DC/Marvel movies up the ying-yang!!! :) This trailer blows out Batman vs Superman!!! #BonerAlert"
CmRih_VtVAs,02:06 I came.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, Jai Courtney just pulled a great Tom Hardy here. Now THAT'S acting!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith will probably boycott the premiere if he doesn't get top-billing. 
It'd be ""racist"" if his supporting character doesn't get top billing."
CmRih_VtVAs,This Was Horrible Just Like The Batman V Superman Trailer...
CmRih_VtVAs,"this movie and deadpool will take 2016.
fuck batman v superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,Tumblr: THE MOVIE.
CmRih_VtVAs,The movie looks so good and the Song choice is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,joker and harley omg
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,I just love when you can tell the actors are having a good time. It makes it more enjoyable for the viewer.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think this could be one of the greatest movies ever made.
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T wait to show you my toys.
CmRih_VtVAs,Now I want part in of the Suicide Squad. Looks fun! ...and dangerous!
CmRih_VtVAs,You know how God damn fucking much I want this shit to be like RRR+ this needs to kick ass!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,BADASS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fully erect, waiting for insertion."
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought my Spotify was playing there for a sec.
CmRih_VtVAs,finally DC can make some profit of this
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice sountrack for Suicide Squad n trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,who da fk is dis https://youtu.be/CmRih_VtVAs?t=112
CmRih_VtVAs,What's Batman Vs Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,was that a robin and joker scene
CmRih_VtVAs,I remember reading this comic when I was a kid! None of you younguns would remember the comic book. :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,"is the video broke or what? i kept reloading the video, and the views stays the same lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Favorite part 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,All I got to say is..........I'll be there on release day nuff said
CmRih_VtVAs,D.C over MARVEL!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so hyped for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Sexy.
CmRih_VtVAs,SOOOOO FREAKING READY OMF
CmRih_VtVAs,simply love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Heroes""? ""Saving the world""?
Fuck that, I was expecting backstabbing criminals doing shady government stuff at gunpoint, not some saccharine fairy tale again..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie had rated r potential. Still hyped af
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks so much better than Batman V Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"fuck deadpool's new trailer..this what i call ""new trailer...👍👍☝"
CmRih_VtVAs,Star Wars was a complete fuck up. This doesn't look like a fuck up at all. My cock is stiffer than a rusty valve for this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,This. Was. A. Masterpiece.
CmRih_VtVAs,The view counter isn't working.....it's been at the same place for a couple of hours.
CmRih_VtVAs,My penis wants to go inside Margot Robbie and stay there.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hello Reddit!
CmRih_VtVAs,"damn, i love this trailer, joker awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow! Just wow!!! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"holy sh!t, harley queen what a wonderful piece of azz"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Orb at 01:22 ? I think Marvel gonna sue somebody.
CmRih_VtVAs,Saw the Trailer. I`m touching myself tonight!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This may be the most fun I've had watching a trailer in heaven knows how long. If the movie lives up to this trailer, Suicide Squad's going to become THE movie that redefines the DCCU, no matter what amazing things they do in BvS. I'm right there with you, Taskforce X."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like Margot is gonna be a fucking perfect Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"My opinion: Batman to Superman sucks, Suicide Squad is excellent. A Joker is amazing!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great song selection! You don't have to be old to enjoy cool music like this. My generation's music is just ... anyways can't wait for this movie!!! Then Deadpool - B v. S! Yeah I'm pumped!!
CmRih_VtVAs,VERY GOOD
CmRih_VtVAs,the whole vibe changed.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like shes gonna do super awesome at being Harley Quinn. Though, I also would have loved to see Ashley Costello be Harley Quinn. Conflicts."
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is fucking perfect as Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,if they keep the fucked up trippy dark comedy action vibe that the trailer has it could be awesome ... that stated might be hard to do especially without a R ratting
CmRih_VtVAs,"did they just bohemian us


love it"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks a lot bettor then i expected
CmRih_VtVAs,Man its going to be epic awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,When did Adam Korvic become a movie star?
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:54 and 1:43 Clint Eastwood's lookalike son, Scott Eastwood."
CmRih_VtVAs,Shut up and take my money
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like they're waiting for the box office results of Deadpool until they confirm whether this might be a PG-13 or R. I know they've said they were aiming for PG-13, but if Deadpool rocks the box office, they might go all out with this. 
Either way, it's looking pretty great. PG-13 will be fine."
CmRih_VtVAs,"If only I hadn't read all the super cringey info about Jared Leto as the Joker. That kind of ruined him for me, I can't take it seriously."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, good trailer. I love queen and all there songs. But it just didn't fit."
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOO AWESOOOOOOOME !!!!!!!!! CAN'T WAIT !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great song choice. Jared Leto looks brilliant, so does Margot as Harley."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:56 Joker jumping into Ace Chemical's vat? Probably after pushing Harley in since the next shot looks like theyre in acid
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,Now THIS is how you make a fucking trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks way better than BvS, that's for damn sure."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Kill everyone? nah.""
""It's just the voices in my head.""
""What? I'm kidding.""



""That's not what they really said.""
WOW."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is quite possibly the best thing, since Christmas."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMGG I CAN'T BREATH
CmRih_VtVAs,Do You Hear That?? It's all the Marvel Fans Converting to DC..
CmRih_VtVAs,only good dc movie calling it now
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM HOPING (don't shoot me) THAT THIS MOVIE WILL MAJE NE WANT TO GDT INTO DC STUFF MORE
CmRih_VtVAs,kinda like psycho-pass
CmRih_VtVAs,"....I kinda wish *Zack Snyder* was directing _this_ movie instead. 

_Suicide Squad_ looks like a TON of fun and seems like the kinda movie that Snyder can have fun with and just let loose."
CmRih_VtVAs,Calling it now that Cap Boomerang and Slipknot are going to plan some shenanigans to try and escape Task Force X but shit goes wrong and Cap lets Slipknot die.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Gosh ! Margot Robbies Ass !
CmRih_VtVAs,The CGI is rampant as well as blatant.
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:35 beer is love, beer is life"
CmRih_VtVAs,"eh, I liked it because of the queen song."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Movie. Trailer. Ever!!!!!!!!!! (Also yet again Margot Robbie making me question my sexuality...)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Under 1 million club.

This movie is going to make me lick a snails balls its so good."
CmRih_VtVAs,little disappointed with harley's voice.. guess they didn't want to annoy everyone with 2 hours of it
CmRih_VtVAs,"This night, DC owned Marvel lmfao"
CmRih_VtVAs,yeah im not into internet debate as there is no moderator. i respectfully disagree. have a pleasant evening.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Excited, but dialogue sounds a little shitty (particularly Harley's.)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am looking forward to this movie, more than Batman V Superman!!! I just wish they had made this movie rated R."
CmRih_VtVAs,shit. this movie just got awsome. queen just improved it's awesomeisity. yes. that is a word
CmRih_VtVAs,NICE!!!! I cant wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like it has more style than substance.
CmRih_VtVAs,what a Fucking awful trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you make a trailer. The hype is SOOO fucking real!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass)
CmRih_VtVAs,Nails joker voice and laugh 👌🏻love it can't wait 😁
CmRih_VtVAs,You have one BIG + for the Queen Song!
CmRih_VtVAs,"We're bad guys, it's what we do...."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm ready!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody<3
CmRih_VtVAs,Stuck on 499k views??
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP Marvel's kids movies
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing...but Margot Robbie has really fucked up Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"In Batman v Superman trailer, there are too many spoilers (I hope I'm wrong, but I think I know the story of the movie). This trailer is awesome. And, yeah, Heath Ledger is the real Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,can't  wait! !!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC VILLAINS RULE.
CmRih_VtVAs,sold
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit.. i cant wait..
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker Looks Awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,1:35 Boomerang could steal the show. But maybe I'm biased.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was much better than any of the Batman v. Superman ones and the first trailer for this film itself.
CmRih_VtVAs,*sips pop*
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see the jokers Toys!?! 😈
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,Fun... It looks like it'll be fun... Looks like DC's finally taking the stick out of it's ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"alright, this looks like fun"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Gotta say, this is the only DC movie I might be looking forward to. :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,ZOMG!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my Toys!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"An interesting choice for trailer music, hope this movie turns out well."
CmRih_VtVAs,haven't been this excited for a movie in a long time!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,It requires lots of balls to use Queen's song on a trailer :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fuck........ This looks Better than BvS 

DC, Be careful you are rising the bar very high in the initial movies Itself, lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harleys really hot butt she needs to bring up her ass game
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shit i am actually crying like a baby
CmRih_VtVAs,holy shit i am actually crying like a baby
CmRih_VtVAs,"internet spoiler said is gonna be dark serios since the first trailer release , but look at this , more fun huh^_^  f*ck spoilers  cant predict at all,"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. What a fucking time to be alive!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie not only it will be  dark , but funny too."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can dig it.
CmRih_VtVAs,lit af
CmRih_VtVAs,"hey whose that guy at the end that say "" what the hell is wrong with you people? and where is he from again?"
CmRih_VtVAs,David Ayer should helm both justice league movies!
CmRih_VtVAs,HAHAHA I love Jared Leto but his looks like trash.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, I admit- that was pretty cool. Look like Deadpool from DC"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay so... this trailer was one big meme
I can imagine David Ayer telling Warner that ""alright, in the first trailer we had that Bee Gees song. Because 'joke' – The Joker. Get it guys? So now we can have Queen. You know, subtle. Subtlety is in my DNA. I got this"""
CmRih_VtVAs,wayne's world brought me here
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG. THE EDITING. THE CHARACTERS. THIS LOOKS INSANE - PUN INTENDED.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Usually when I hear Queen in a trailer, it feels like a cheap cop-out attempt to make the film look more epic than it is. Here? It's match made in Arkham Asylum - It's perfect!"
CmRih_VtVAs,god bless Jared Leto
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is so MOOOOOEEEEEEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,"When I hear The Joker talk, it reminds me of Boyd from Justified."
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie gonna be so bad
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder if the way this movie will end is with Harley betraying the team and Batman shows up to put them all down! I really can't wait to see Batman confront the Joker!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lovely wacky trailer. See guys, DC isn't always so grim and gloomy."
CmRih_VtVAs,you can cut diamonds with my nipples right now
CmRih_VtVAs,the teaser trailer was better
CmRih_VtVAs,that was fuckin cool
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg I need this song
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably going to happen the suicide squad gets hired to take out joker and his group of mercenary thugs which explains harleys involvement because she's the only one that was close to him and along the way of their war enchantress starts losing it and starts going ape shit fighting off her possession and causes the big ass commotion in the city and they have to stop her from destroying the world my guess^ lol
CmRih_VtVAs,August 5th? fucking kidding me?
CmRih_VtVAs,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay bitch!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I think he nailed joker's laugh...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto's portrayal of joker is brilliant, I never doubted him."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Daniela Ruah in the beginning?
CmRih_VtVAs,Im fucking hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell yeah Suicide Squad looks even better than BvS and everyone seems to just go all out I can't wait for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,
CmRih_VtVAs,I love you Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone knows what is the font type they're using at 2:22
CmRih_VtVAs,PQOP QUE TRAILER FODA!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,YESSS!!!! YES YES YESSSSS!!!! The song choice omgggg ahhhh!!! I CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am a simple man, I see a woman using a pantie , I pause the video"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie has just gone to the top of my most anticipated of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker is👌👌👌
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song? That singer is kinda cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,"FINALLY, they showed more Cara Delevingne!! 

Don't understand why Enchantress STILL looks like the girl from The Ring though."
CmRih_VtVAs,R.I.P MARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm kinda scared this trailer might be better than the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"As long as what Will Smith means by, ""Let's save the world"" is ""Let's shoot a bunch of people"" I'll be happy with this movie. Deadshot is no hero. None of them are. That's the whole point."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith acts like himself too much .-. he needs to act like deashot... / \
CmRih_VtVAs,OH.FUCK.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Go Time, GO!"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMGGGG
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:57

Is just my idea or harleys permonace Its the same of the new 52? 

FUCKING AWESOME!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"please no more trailer, this is so good. i don't want get spoiler for the next trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Going to be better than BvS but both will be dope!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, I am admitting this is awesome, and that I cannot wait for it, but Deadpool is a contender for kicking their arse, aye"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This shit looks incredible,."
CmRih_VtVAs,And the song choice makes it 1000x better
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just a TINY nitpick, but is it me or does joker's hand at 1:20 NOT look bleach? Last time I checked, I heard this joker fell into of chemical waste.  Oh well :X Jared Leto is gonna nail it either way :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,sick trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07  Gooood :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"THE BEST YEAR, I CANT WAIT !

CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 твой любимый момент)
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not sure if I like the ""We're bad guys!"" Line, but Harley's ""Woah!"" was perfect"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm afraid that someone will comment that they actually didn't know the trailer song!!! (Bohemian Rhapsody.) And they hear it here first. >:(((

CmRih_VtVAs,"Brace yourselves, a mother is going to petition to make this movie PG... :/"
CmRih_VtVAs,Smill With looks awesome in this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everyone saying DC has won already, while I love marvel and DC, you're forgetting, marvel still has their secret weapon, they have one major secret weapon for this war and they're clearly not afraid to use it, and that is Spider-Man, trust me, marvel knows what they're doing"
CmRih_VtVAs,The first trailer is bettter/
CmRih_VtVAs,Say it with me : Jared Leto will win another Oscars for this
CmRih_VtVAs,HOKAGE
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything but Jai Courtney looks gr8
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker look stupid with his metal teeth.
CmRih_VtVAs,Before this in the teaser I was excited for Harley Quinn. Now after this trailer I'm excite for almost every scene she's in now.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,DEADPOOL AND SUICIDE SQUAD plus HARLEY QUINN LOOKS BAD ASS!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS TRAILER CANT WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome doesn't do this trailer enough justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I must say, this looks like a damn, damn, good movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody FTW
CmRih_VtVAs,"OH MY GOD THE WHOLE CAST IS PERFECT AND THIS TRAILER IS FUCKING AMAZING, 2016 IS DC'S YEAR"
CmRih_VtVAs,So basically DC Guardians?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can someone help me explain what Tom Hardy is doing in the movie??? He was supposed to play Rick Flagg but dropped the role, but is still in the trailer as someone else? He isnt listed on the cast, BUT HES IN THE TRAILER? WTF HELP ME, WHO DOES HE PLAY?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm crying
CmRih_VtVAs,Tone reminds me of Guardians of the Galaxy.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG MUST BUILD A TIMEMACHINE  TO GET TO AUG. Fuck batman v superman this looks awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,we are bad guys do what we do.... 😜
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even know why I bother reading the comments anymore -.-
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know about you, but I this looks goooooooooooood. Way better than Batman v. Superman (my personal opinion of course)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Ya know...the more I see of Jared's Joker...the less I want to see of him.
CmRih_VtVAs,ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!
CmRih_VtVAs,oh....my....God. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"So amazingly beautiful. The helicopter lighting, with the missiles, it looks beautiful. the joker's scenes look beautiful. i can't wait."
CmRih_VtVAs,Brilliant DC brilliant. Can't wait!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The dialogue is SO cheesy that it made me cringe, but the styling is on point"
CmRih_VtVAs,"FUCKING AWESOME, NOW THIS IS SUICIDE SQUAD!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,F**k me this movie has style.
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought killer croc will look like shit but in action it better what I thought
CmRih_VtVAs,who's going to be the villain?
CmRih_VtVAs,Bruhhhh
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype is real
CmRih_VtVAs,My pants shall remain wet.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg this is amazing. +1 for bohemian rhapsody

CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 Is that the Orb?
CmRih_VtVAs,guess i know where i will be spending my student loan this year.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hoping to see Batman going after Joker to get revenge after Jason Todd's death, would be pretty dope! And this trailer is looking pretty good!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is everyone so butt hurt because of Will Smith? You really think Will Smith...WILL SMITH is going to RUIN the film? Give me a break. He had a few mediocre films so now he's a terrible actor? No one is forcing you to watch this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,I heard the first note of Bohemian Rhapsody and knew this trailer was about to be fantastic.
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how there's people saying rube seen the whole movie when what WB is doing is pretty brilliant! They're keeping people interested all while only showing what looks like ONE mission and some of Harley's origin... Suicide squad is marketing really well so far! So fucking stoked!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC? With humour? No can't be
CmRih_VtVAs,Is the inception bwaahhh finally dead?
CmRih_VtVAs,Please tell me I'm not the only one who shakes my head like mad when Bohemian Rapsody really kicks in like in Wayne's World
CmRih_VtVAs,Every scene fits with the Bohemian Rhapsody rhythm so nicely that i think im going to throw up by the exciment !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad, Rated R"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was hoping for an extremely hot Harley Quinn, especially since she was gonna be played by Margot Robbie (The extremely hot blond from Wolf Of Wall Street). But now that I see her, I dunno anymore... I just don't know."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 MAMMA MIA MAMA MIA!!! JOKERS CRAZY ASS!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"yikes, looks awful."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC will have 2 major hits this year
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn doe
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant stop watching it
CmRih_VtVAs,this will be thebest batman movie without batman
CmRih_VtVAs,1069 people are mermaid fans
CmRih_VtVAs,I need to watch that again
CmRih_VtVAs,I am honestly more excited for this than BvS!
CmRih_VtVAs,DON'T RUIN THIS LIKE BATMAN V SUPERMAN WITH TEASERS AND TRAILERS BASICALLY SHOWING THE WHOLE MOVIE PLEASE !!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is fucking it, superman v batman has nothing on this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Круто чё!
CmRih_VtVAs,"01:10 The most adorable ""woah"" EVVVVVERR."
CmRih_VtVAs,YEESSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel fans admit it Dc has wayyyyy better villains.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I CANT WAIT, I'M SO HYPED"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was so good like a cherry ontop of the first one! I'm so going to see this looks so bad ass!
CmRih_VtVAs,joker holy crap okay looks very promising
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst VIllians ever but Best Trailer Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks way way way way better than batman v superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally some trailer that doesn't have ""epic dramatic"" music but instead something more original. Been sick of it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's a trap... this trailer is too good, the actual movie will suck I'm afraid.. :S"
CmRih_VtVAs,foda
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST!
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy. Fucking. Shit. What a great time to be alive for comic book movies
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,where's the bats!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith goin to win an oscar for his role
CmRih_VtVAs,1:29 Take a look at Joker's Toys\m/
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks amazing. And I have no fucking clue who the villain is, which means it is actually NOT Joker. If it is not Joker I will be so fucking happy."
CmRih_VtVAs,So much better than the first teaser trailer. Much more excited for this than I am Yawn of Justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,That was TRIPPY
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to see this film
CmRih_VtVAs,Actually looks pretty promising!!
CmRih_VtVAs,came here for suicidesquad heard bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking music ruined the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"please don't make Joker part of suicide squad, please make him just part of Quinn's past."
CmRih_VtVAs,terrible song
CmRih_VtVAs,"I enjoyed seeing all the new clips! The problem with the trailer is that it presented itself like a summer action flick, which was very inconsistent with its previous trailers, where a darker tone was taken. In my opinion."
CmRih_VtVAs,Weird seeing this much color in a DC movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad + Queen = Perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,"So good, can't wait to see the movie in August!!!!!! 🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃 😀😄"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is Awesome! Mamma Mia!
CmRih_VtVAs,"You marvel fanboys crack me up😂😂as a fan of both....Marvel has had alot of bad movies too......more than DC...Marvel just made more movie and did they're cinamatic universe in like 3 years......Yeah Dc has had bad movie, Superman returns, Green Lantern & Cat woman. You guys put marvel on the pedestal like all they're movies were great. Age of ultron was wack for lots of reasons. CAP. 1 sucked, Iron Man 2 & 3 sucked, Thor 1 & 2 sucked. You guys are nick picking a movie before it even comes out thats just pathetic.... i have no doubt civil will be awesome but the thing is, its not the same like in the comic books, it looks like more of a love story than anything fr..i have high hope for DC cause it's Marvel fanboys that make it hard to set back and enjoy.. Batmam v Superman might be to packed or whatever else fanboys wanna bitch about, but here's the thing DC IS NOT FUCKING MARVEL!! They dont have to do a goddamn orgin storg first before putting they're most famous characters in one movie...not all of em tho. Marvel cant even do a good ass villain, or have a scene with a cheesy ass joke....the only good Marvel films are GOTG, Winter Solider, and the first Avengers movie & Iron Man 1...everything else is Only enjoyed by mavrel fags..Yeah DC has alot of catching up to do. Ppl already seen Iron Man And Caps love intrest.. im ready to see frank miller Batman and New 52 superman on the bih scene... its dumb asses like Marvel fanboys who can't just sit back and enjoy...one just gotta be better than the other smh, thats dumb. Some pll dont want DC movies to be better than Marvel. BvS doesn't have to be better than Cilvil war....but ut will be 10x better than anything marvel has done and thats if it's good...which it looks like it is....yeah it has its flaws cause ppl lile to be butthurt n nickpick. But so does Marvel not all they're movies were good & look now..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this will some how connect to Batman vs Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"No other song would have been better! Have you people seen the line up!!
http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/fullcredits/cast?ref_=m_tt_cl_sc"
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST FUCKING SONG!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel?... DC?... whats that? I just love Superheroes story...
CmRih_VtVAs,The thing that i dont like with dceu is cinematic and tv show is not connected
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the galaxy of DC!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 Creepy AF.
CmRih_VtVAs,i wonder if superman will make a cameo in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"this comment is in a nutshell. You got people arguing dc vs marvel, you got people bitching how bad this is,you got  people are saying that they hate Batman v Superman but love this movie and then you get real fan excited for both dc and marvel movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,mea
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn isn't making me laugh and that's a problem. I really hope these aren't her best jokes from the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,i saw jinx ????
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks pretty legit. Touche' DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's got joker, harley Quinn deadshot and batman so yeah I am more hyped for this than batman vs superman ( Doomsday looks like a b**ch)."
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCKING HYPED. FUCK YOU MARVEL.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can you see The Jokers scars at 01:29 looks kinda like he does hmmm. Epic trailor!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This shit is bananas! I'm excited as all hell!
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks like they are going with the Zombie take over a stadium story from the comic book.

I have not been as excited for a movie in some time.  Both trailers look amazing."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I cannot believe that they just keep and keep and keep using old ass songs that we all grew tired of.
Don't get me wrong, I love Queen, but can you just fucking pay your composers to make something new, you cheap bastards?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"-hopping in my time machine to 2016 AUGUST -coming back tomorrow to tell you haters , how badass it was! -"
CmRih_VtVAs,i hate joker´s teeth.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think I saw this in the 1990s, along with all the other forgetful superhero films that came out then too.

Waynes World called too..they want their mixtape back."
CmRih_VtVAs,"WHAT A HELL I JUST WATCH? DC, HAVE YOU TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD WITH SUCH PERFECT TRAILERS? Ohhh, it is Suicide Squad marketing team. Well....carry on :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,i love the creepy looking joker... he looks beyond insane.
CmRih_VtVAs,Something different!!
CmRih_VtVAs,That was one of the most epic trailers I have ever fucking seen in my life.
CmRih_VtVAs,Omggg Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn?!! Yes please!!!!!<3333
CmRih_VtVAs,Editor of this trailer should win an Oscar.
CmRih_VtVAs,HELLLLL YEAH
CmRih_VtVAs,such glorious shit

CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks badass, whoever had their doubts about Leto must feel foolish, he looks crazy and sounds psychotic"
CmRih_VtVAs,HAAAARLEEEEYYYYY
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is in this? Now you *know* it's going to be bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Honestly looks like a way better film than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,The Joker's really enjoying himself.
CmRih_VtVAs,perfect!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg that just amazing , i cant wait"
CmRih_VtVAs,This song was stuck in my head all day yesterday and now i see it in the trailer. Badass
CmRih_VtVAs,"THAT JOKER LAUGH, ALRIGHT IM SOLD, NO LONGER A SKEPTIC."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys"""
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one that feels that they're not making this movie look as epic or serious as batman v superman? i mean i think the original trailer was better cuz it seemed more serious.
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is a must watch! idc if other ppl hate it like blah blah blah.This wasn't made for your opinions.
CmRih_VtVAs,"S E N S A C I O N A L

CmRih_VtVAs,WILL SMITH 😱
CmRih_VtVAs,looks fuckin terrible. Sorry but margot hasn't the ability to looks bad ass. she just don't pull off 'bad bitch' very well. another modern let down
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK! YES!
CmRih_VtVAs,THAT is how you do a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Fukin Awesome!!! SQWAD !!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like Rated R, turns out it is Kiddish-13"
CmRih_VtVAs,I loved the first trailer but this is crap. The song doesn't go with it at all and the story doesn't seem interesting anymore
CmRih_VtVAs,I know what I'm going to comicon as now :')
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad might save D.C., given a R rating this movie could've been amazing!"
CmRih_VtVAs,It would be cool if Suicide Squad and Batman v. Superman would be connected
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:20 no. Just NO. Oh, and fuck your complaints."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love the trailer, but this seemed WAYYY to upbeat for a movie like this

That being said, the cast looks great, and Jared Leto looks TERRIFYING as the Joker, should be awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will the real Tom Hardy please stand up? I know its not him, but, the confusion continues dammit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yea pretty much the whole comments section is in unison. This isn't like Revenant or MM trailer good, but nonetheless this shit be doper than Batman V Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,awemazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Love the trailer, but this seemed WAYYY to upbeat for a movie like this

That being said, the cast looks great, and Jared Leto looks TERRIFYING as the Joker, should be awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,The dirty girl with the fly's around her does she have the power of stink?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney looks awesome in this. How is that possible?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is better then the first, i loved it so much, Go Queen!"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 - best scene of trailer. Just stop it. You are welcome.
CmRih_VtVAs,what villain calls them self the BAD GUY? lol looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,"OH my God I'm, I'm, it's so so.....good....aghhhhhhh!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is completely and utterly insane beyond anyone of the average, calm, collected mind. A COMPLETE MAD HOUSE... this is gonna be fun."
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh. Ill watch it but i dodnt think itll be vary good
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks amazing, but my moneys on deadpool between this and Batman v. Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for this movie more than BvS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great trailer....
except for the fact that 
HARLEY DOESN""T HAVE HER F*CKING ACCENT!!!!!!

YOU HAD ONE JOB WARNER BROS!!
ONE F*CKING JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 is my new wallpaper !!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG I CANT COPE WITH WAITING THAT LONG I NEED IT NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,Shut up and take my money!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad x Queen!
CmRih_VtVAs,Un manjarsh
CmRih_VtVAs,omggg
CmRih_VtVAs,What.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley didn't look too good. Wrong actress imo. Everything else was great and I'm pumped.
CmRih_VtVAs,Was not expecting Will Smith to be in it though. can't wait for this one. I kinda like the new Joker. Can't wait to hear how he fully sounds
CmRih_VtVAs,Listen to me carefully...... you have given us two captivating trailers that have still not told us the details to your movie. So please do not give us a third trailer that spoils everything! Be better than Batman vs Superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the witch come off like pigpen from the peanuts?
CmRih_VtVAs,<--- This guy should've been in this movie!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Still can't believe a team that has been above mediocre gets a movie over better teams like JSA and The Titans.
CmRih_VtVAs,My favorite part was from 0:00 to  02:31
CmRih_VtVAs,what now? I fall in love with that girl! :))
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith? Totally breaks what they're going for.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can Deadpool make a cameo in this? He would fit perfectly. I know he is Marvel, but I honestly think he wouldn't care about technicalities like that. :P"
CmRih_VtVAs,Has a Rob Zombie type of humor happening.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 Emma Watson??
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was really hoping that they wouldn't go with the ""dip Harley in chemicals to make her crazy too"" angle. That was one of the changes in the New 52 that I'm personally not fond of since it makes Joker's change into what he is less special in my opinion. It kind of contradicts my favorite idea of having any number of different truths to how he got that way. In a sense it just kind of removes some of his character and mystery."
CmRih_VtVAs,I CANT WAIT LIKE 8 MONTHS??!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Queen and superheroes...Well, that was pretty unexpected, but I'm okay with that"
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how it matches the beat of Bohemian Rhapsody with the destruction going on the trailer haha
CmRih_VtVAs,DC Comics is taking over 2k16
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS AWESOME!!
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing! what a trailer!!! can't wait...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I myself am usually not a huge fan of DC movies...but I do love DC shows like Smallville, The Flash, and Gotham. I must admit this is pretty bad-ass trailer. I might actually watch this...the movie doesn't take itself as serious as DC movies usually do. I'm honestly not a huge fan of Batman nor new Superman movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,so you think you can stop me and spit in my eye!
CmRih_VtVAs,HARLEEYYYYY NEED THIS MOVIE NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here BECAUSE Tryon magus's Reaction was not good.
CmRih_VtVAs,guardians of the galaxy was marvel's star wars and suicide squad is dc's guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,SO. MUCH. WIN.
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW. THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS REALLY REALLY GOOD
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney really!!...Why go with the the poor man's/fake Tom Hardy ....when the real effing Tom Hardy is avail!
CmRih_VtVAs,The play on color is just soo nicely done!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope this is good but I can't help but think the hype will lead nowhere..
If nothing else I do like the look of the characters ."
CmRih_VtVAs,Was not looking forward to this film beforehand but after this trailer I'm pretty excited. If it only had some decent costume design it'd be perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Terrible OST
CmRih_VtVAs,eu vou casar com esse trailer namoral...
CmRih_VtVAs,Feel nothing. I'd rather watch deadpool trailer one more time.
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,1000 marvel idiots disliked this
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Booty
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me or the trailer came out too soon. it's killing me that i have to wait more than half a year. it's killin' meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel who?
CmRih_VtVAs,Best fucking trailer ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome trailer with awesome song
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, now I have to see this."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it weird that this made me hard?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This continues to look better than BvS.  In every way.  Adding Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" only made it feel even better than the last SS trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Everything about this trailer is right!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,whorse of the whorse
CmRih_VtVAs,hella good choice of a song
CmRih_VtVAs,whorse of the whorse
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is going to be my favorite villain!
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,Get the fuck out of my recommended section you pile of shit
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn 😍😘
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie is going to take over every scene shes in.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 Groot?
CmRih_VtVAs,...blown...away
CmRih_VtVAs,It sure will be the best film of the year
CmRih_VtVAs,"*ANOTHER Suicide Squad trailer? Holy shit, my dick can't get any harder!*"
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE!!! Captain Boomerang stole the show as did Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, so... not quite what I expected for Harley, but please tell me she'll doing some acrobatic flips and cartwheels or perhaps have a handy bag of silly (but deadly) trinkets."
CmRih_VtVAs,Better be worth closing down Yonge St and blocking GO bus terminal
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks quality
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 nice! =v
CmRih_VtVAs,its good to talk ....... just not to the voices in your head 😂
CmRih_VtVAs,YES FUCK YES
CmRih_VtVAs,Katana looks so badass
CmRih_VtVAs,What is that? 1:58-1:59 What happen to the Joker and Harley? Please don't kill Harley :(
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm crying
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know man... I'm not really feeling this one :/
CmRih_VtVAs,JARED LETO JOKER RULES!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"wtf is this awkward humor, I thought this movie was cereal"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This my good people, is how you make a trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley Quinn without her New York voice is 
KILLING ME! IT'S TEARING AT MY SOUL! OH JESUS GOD WHY!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,wow it's like guardians of the galaxy...dc version
CmRih_VtVAs,margot was born to play harley!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:08 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,R.I.P my wallet!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The instance i heard bohemian. Automatic yes times 7!
CmRih_VtVAs,If what I presume about this joker is true then its the perfect joker for this movie. explains his appearance and all that stuff.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:06 you're welcome :)
CmRih_VtVAs,omg i can't wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I would go see it in theaters if I wasn't afraid that of psychos who would shoot up shit and kill people aka MARVEL fanboys
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith!
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever edited this should've been hired for Batman V Superman's last trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really want for Jai Courtney to catch a break, man =) Maybe with this one people will finally appreciate that he is not that bad of an actor really."
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the song trailer: bohemian rhapsody... if you haven't heard it before and I don't care if you are young or a kid ..go fuck yourself... or search it
CmRih_VtVAs,BRUH! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST.MUSIC .VIDEO.EVER!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,II NEEEED MOREEE!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen's song killed it. One of the best!
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait for mr.movie sunday breakdown
CmRih_VtVAs,this movie gonna be COOL!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:56 love her so much lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC heros badass than Marvel villians
. my english is bad too"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone else not feeling Margot Robbie as Harley. I am. Especially she doesn't even have the voice. A lot of Harley is her voice, and she doesn't even have anything close to it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is anyone else in love with Harley Quinn ? ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys. This is what we do"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks good, although I agree with some commenters about the Guardians of the Galaxy vibe. At least in terms of how the trailer is constructed. That's not a bad thing, GoTG is awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,I want more Joker and Harley damn it...
CmRih_VtVAs,I came to this 🌚
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the new guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,I jerked off to this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Hahaha! THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT!
CmRih_VtVAs,Are you sure this isn't scheduled for earlier? Maybe 2007?
CmRih_VtVAs,So... Kick Ass meets Guardians of the Galaxy. Only with dialogue more obvious than Joker's tattoos. Pass
CmRih_VtVAs,"THE JOKER , OMFG! . 
Please dont be shitty pleasseeee......."
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS WILL BE BETTER THAN BATMAN V SUPERMAN
CmRih_VtVAs,Yessssssss
CmRih_VtVAs,Well played Warner Bros.
CmRih_VtVAs,its here i cant wait i love DC this is the movie ive been anticipating the most
CmRih_VtVAs,Sweet!!!!! Hmmm I bet Eastwood is one of the dying folk
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol i thought this will be a whole series, not a movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not okay
CmRih_VtVAs,"There is no one on Earth who can play Harley better than Margot based off the trailers alone. Looks like she's gunna be the perfect Harley. And Jared Leto looks like a phenomenal Joker, as well as the rest of the cast seeming as tho they will kill it"
CmRih_VtVAs,"At the time of this comment there are 499,062 views"
CmRih_VtVAs,"WONDERFUL!!!!! In the first five seconds, the only thing in my mind is Freddie Mercury and Bohemian Rhapsody. That is very amazing, I'm waiting for the film. P/s : Is this the real life?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dc is gonna have some great movie's
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry Batman V Superman. I'm still hyped, but this trailer makes me want to watch this more lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,SOOO GOOD!! 😭 And song choice 👌👌👌👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you release a great follow up trailer Zach Snyder
CmRih_VtVAs,Was joker talking to jason
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,Everyone knows this will be the best film of the summer
CmRih_VtVAs,"If its not rated R, not worth watching"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love this trailer, this trailer is dope! Now with that being said, the only gripe I have is the amount of times they use the term ""bad guys"" as if the writers couldn't find any plausible alternatives. Other than that, great trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a edgy scene kid/teen flick.
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't even focus on the trailer. Too busy singing Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,gosh darn cara is beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is cringeworthy so far. Joker looks promising.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:32 is that Akira from teen wolf ?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fucking awesome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer is literally a million times better than the ""Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice"" trailer.

I am so excited for this."
CmRih_VtVAs,Screw DC their movies aren't even good..... The only good thing about this is Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,this is going to be EPIC!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is distracting to me he doesn't belong here anyone even tyrese would of done well but will Smith is played out lol 

Harley quinn isn't crazy enough we need a crazier psychotic girly girl oh well maybe I should do casting lol wish Brittany Murphy was s still alive she would of did great as Harley"
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like dogshit
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Harley Queen doesn't totally convince me but the rest of the cast looks freaking great, specially the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Woohoo! Just saw the whole movie in the trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst. Text Cards. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie as harley quin is by far the best part of this movie for me I can't wait to see more of her !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,it's amazing how a few different clips and song choices can change a once dark trailer into a more comedic lighthearted one. that just shows how amazing this movie is going to be.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:26 What car is THAT?
CmRih_VtVAs,kill me im dreaming
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer sold me. Well done
CmRih_VtVAs,is it just me or does the joker laugh at 1:28 sound like the grinch
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad!!!! I Like
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith was the worst fucking casting choice
And Leto's Joker still just looks fucking stupid."
CmRih_VtVAs,2 edgy 4 me
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer made it seem really dark, kind of like The Dark Knight, but this trailer makes it seem comical like Guardians of the Galaxy. Pretty weird difference in trailers."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared leto looking like he might pull off a real nice joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,1k people are from the smart majority
CmRih_VtVAs,I love that 'woah' from harley at 1:55 haha cant wait for this. 2 more months for BvS then this wooooooooohhh
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. Margot Robbie has got some terrible dialogue in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Comic book movie + universally popular song = profit!
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC and Marval have a pattern going on, not that I'm complaining. You got two major heros fighting, #DawnOfJustice & #CivilWar. Then you have the Anti hero flick #Deadpool & #SuicideSquad. Frankly I'm excited for all movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am more optimistic about Joker now. Leto looks good, not Ledger good but good. And I still don't approve damaged tattoo on forehead. It is just stupid and he need eyebrows too."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah
Wanna put this trailer on replay,
I can watch it all day,
I can see it with you all day,
watch it all day
Yeah"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 DAT ASS
CmRih_VtVAs,Rapmon should do a rap for this movie to make up for the fantastic 4 one this deserves his talents!!
CmRih_VtVAs,ai meus órgãos anais
CmRih_VtVAs,The music and the editing is perfect for this trailer. They should not post anymore until the movie releases
CmRih_VtVAs,BUT I CANT WAIT FOR 7 MONTHS AND A HALF. ITS LIKE DECADES
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst hero?ever heard of........


DEEEEEAAAAADPOOOOOOOLLLLLL ?????????"
CmRih_VtVAs,did they just show us the entire movie or what LOL
CmRih_VtVAs,was that jared leto without makeup on?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,OH CRAP here come all the unfunny memes to flood Facebook!
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't find my headphones 😒
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit, they actually got Jai Courtney to act! That is no small feat!"
CmRih_VtVAs,this has made me want to watch this movie more than Batman Vs Superman now ... bravo WHAT A TRAILER !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"ESSE TRAILER É SENSACIONAL! 
EU ESTOU SEM PALAVRAS..
CONTANDO OS DIAS PARA A ESTREIA 
PQP TÁ TUDO MUITO F.O.D.A !!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dope!
CmRih_VtVAs,"ESSE TRAILER É SENSACIONAL! 
EU ESTOU SEM PALAVRAS..
CONTANDO OS DIAS PARA A ESTREIA 
PQP TÁ TUDO MUITO FODA!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"ESSE TRAILER É SENSACIONAL! 
EU ESTOU SEM PALAVRAS..
CONTANDO OS DIAS PARA A ESTREIA 
PQP TÁ TUDO MUITO FODA!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well you picked one of the best songs ever made, so it's automatically good. : /"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see now, marvel and DC dis each other with movies this being in response to guardians and avengers,all I can say is DAMN son"
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS.IS.FUCK.AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,"Has anyone else seen what dc have done here, forget comparing with other movies and compare it to the other trailer. It has shown what true madness is, it's both sides of the pendulum, ones gritty dark and downright terrifying, this is lighthearted, fun and overall awsome"
CmRih_VtVAs,why isnt superman or batman trying to help
CmRih_VtVAs,those fonts tho!!! fucking amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,"August 5th, HURRY THE FUCK UP ALREADY!"
CmRih_VtVAs,way to spend a fortune on a song with a a bit of funding left for a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so fucking excited!!
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool >
CmRih_VtVAs,its gonna be disappointing
CmRih_VtVAs,What the frek are they fighting????
CmRih_VtVAs,"lo MEJOR de los trailers fue su música:

1* I Started a Joke (cover de Bee Gees)

2* ""Bohemian Rhapsody"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. Anything POSITIVE?
CmRih_VtVAs,Well that was a waste. Now I saw the movie in just one trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm usually skeptical of movies even when they have great trailers, but THIS. THIS trailer was freaking dope."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everything looks perfect. Especially Margot Robbie, I'm really starting to love that woman."
CmRih_VtVAs,name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Apurense  comentarios en español!
CmRih_VtVAs,this film  success or not will depend on film BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Favorite moment!
CmRih_VtVAs,ahhhhhhhhhh so excited!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect Song! A+ :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so attractive
CmRih_VtVAs,thes best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,under 1million views....i feel part of something epic
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish I could have this 0:45 and wake up seeing her 1:52 every morning
CmRih_VtVAs,I just looooved the song! can't wait for it!
CmRih_VtVAs,@andreblacknerd
CmRih_VtVAs,+andreblacknerd
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks soooooooooooooooooooo good, soooooooo excited!"
CmRih_VtVAs,August?! Thats like
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think if none of us come in with unreasonably high expectations for Letos joker, we can all have a decent fun time. And if he's great then that's just a little bonus."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn 😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Can I sleep till August? XD
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks amazing. I cant wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel needs to reveal spider man to compete with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"See Batman V. Superman, that is how you do a funny trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Glad they didn't f**k this up like they did with the second Batman v. Superman trailer. I can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,damn cant wait ! are those bad people fighting with joker or they alliance with em ???
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody fit it so well omg
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Trailer is Incredible

Aww, Look at the Marvel Fans trying to Hate."
CmRih_VtVAs,I originally didn't like the look of this but i'm starting to come round to it the trailer was very good.
CmRih_VtVAs,You have peeked my interest! @_@
CmRih_VtVAs,Bout time DC steps up. Looks damn cool.
CmRih_VtVAs,What if Cara played Harley?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry, but this just looks stupid. What's the plot? Who's the bad guy? Looks like there isn't one of either. I can't tell if the dude is supposed to be a pussy version of the Joker, and the girl is a stupid version of harley quinn. It's obvious they're running out of ideas. This is what happens when you milk the batman shit too long."
CmRih_VtVAs,"It would be interesting if Harley dies in that vat at 1:58, i always disliked her."
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever picked that song for the trailer deserves a raise
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how to make a good trailer :v
CmRih_VtVAs,Well that will make you forget about the Marvel Universe of movies for a couple of minutes.  Probably one of the best movie trailers ever made in terms of selling the story and appeal.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel Heroes are way better, but nothing tops DC villains. Ever."
CmRih_VtVAs,its like madagascar 3 movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks cheesy as fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad actually looks promising. I'll probably check it out... Unlike the abomination that is Batman v Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,To be 100% honest I hate the choices they made for Leto's costume but I kinda understand what they were going for (a truly dark interpretation of a dark series) which I kinda respect and at the same time not respecting his character. I also kinda think he shouldn't be in till at least the second movie because it would have been really cool if they somewhat followed the comics because we would have a couple cooler characters plus a big conflict between Harley and the Jokers daughter (could have been pretty cool) although maybe they might find a way to make this work better
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so awesome and funny ! I can't stop watching this ! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,absolute garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,I need to see this looks so funny
CmRih_VtVAs,"perfect, it was perfect."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, that's what we do.""

Yep, sounds about the amount of thought they put into the characters in this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst Joker ever i seen. Leto playing very bad. He is not a Joker, he is fck pank."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm going for Harley Quinn, staying for awesomeness."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Done with movie, no need to watch it in August."
CmRih_VtVAs,epic song choice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie nailed it, that funny, crazy, and snarky attitude is Harley Quinn."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys! Fuckin' awesome. :D
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY FUCKING SHIT!! I can't fucking wait for this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Raphsody for the main trailer? Seriously?! The teaser was better! Its not the footage but the song is so-damned distracting and doesnt even fit. What a horrible misuse of copyrighted music in a trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"A definite improvement over the original trailer. However, newer audiences expecting a comedy might be sorely disappointed."
CmRih_VtVAs,Así de arroz o más mole marvel?
CmRih_VtVAs,somebody  want's there own guardians of the galaxy  movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley's my favorite comic book character ever! When I saw the teaser for this, I kind of worried for what I would think of this Harley. I'm a huge fan of the classic Harley Quinn, so I wasn't too excited for the Arkham Series Harley, but I didn't hate her. I just felt like she was made into too much of a sexualized object in the Arkham series, but I must say, I love what I see of Margot's version! I can't wait for this!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,3 hrs half a mil views !! Dayam
CmRih_VtVAs,best casting ever.... the soundtrack was good but it would be better if ROYAL BLOOD gave their soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't for this movie and BvS! Hopefully they are 10x better than that over hyped fest The Force Awakens
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07   tho
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,jizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz'ng
CmRih_VtVAs,"The book that Harley is reading is ""Between the Sheets"" by Molly O'Keefe.
You're welcome :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,YES FUCK YES FUCK
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot robbie just steal the scene FACKKKKKKKK
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beautiful🙌
Every fuc#%*g single part!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"awesome trailer ..
waiting for BATMAN to show up the entire time....."
CmRih_VtVAs,im in love with harley
CmRih_VtVAs,I just busted the fattest nut of my geek life
CmRih_VtVAs,"Before watching the trailer i thought that it would be fun if in the end we saw Batman choking Joker and saying with menacing scary voice: ""I'm not gonna kill you. I'm just gonna hurt you. Really, really bad!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm legitimately more hyped for this than Batman/Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cringey as fuck, with Will Smith playing Will Smith once again."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm having a hard time liking this.
CmRih_VtVAs,thank you
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like the absolute most batfuck insane movie of the year. CANNOT WAIT.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it a coincidence that Will Smith's wife, Jada played Fish Mooney in Gotham?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it me but did anyone else think this trailer was cheesy , unknown suicide member : whats wrong with you people, harley :were the bad guys ..... really you don’t say !!!! i really want to like the film however having queen (which is is awesome band) in the background just doesn’t connect"
CmRih_VtVAs,HOMG!!! Queen's Bohemian rhapsody is cherry on top!!! the trailer is short and sweet! just the perfect length and leaves you wanting for more!!! : D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Viola Davis as Amanda Waller!
Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn!
Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth!
Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam!
Jared Leto as The Joker!
Chris Pine as Steve Trevor!
Ben Affleck as Batman!
Jason Mamoa as Aquaman!

God bless for awesome casting!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,And that it's an incredible Harley Quinn performance...
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Joker and Harley kiss
CmRih_VtVAs,00:36 Mel Gibson.
CmRih_VtVAs,YES!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see a new trend in the movie industry, they are making movies so bad that makes them funny, and that's the selling point"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I must have watched this 20 times by now, pausing to try and catch every little detail in these frames."
CmRih_VtVAs,Best tráiler ever...Queen Bohemian Rapsody just perfect...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm a simple man. I hear Bohemian Rhapsody, I press like."
CmRih_VtVAs,jai Courteney even seems to be doing a good job
CmRih_VtVAs,2:00 JASON TODD !!! (back left)
CmRih_VtVAs,This honestly looks terrible. Like up there with the 2003 Hulk movie. I don't know what they were thinking with any of this.
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait to download the shite out of this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for releasing day!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Are they villains or heroes? I'm confused.
CmRih_VtVAs,Music 99/10
CmRih_VtVAs,"It was just an ad, until it was set to Bohemian Rhapsody, then it was worth paying attention to.

Really, I would not have seen how perfect the pairing of Suicide Squad with Bohemian Rhapsody would be.  Someone had a stroke of genius at Warner Brothers."
CmRih_VtVAs,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?
CmRih_VtVAs,SHEER BRILLIANCE!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks better than any marvel movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I see the oscar for a comic movie, fuck!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"deadshot lookin snaaaazzy with his red monocle, all he needs is Harley's cup of tea and he'd be a true engerlishmen"
CmRih_VtVAs,10/10 this will be SUPA GUDA
CmRih_VtVAs,Orgasms everywhere. Just jizz jizz jizz jizz throughout the whole video. Jizz everywhere and orgasms left and right.
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing Laughing
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks too good to be true
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer looks really good but the song used is not befitting. 
before you all bring out your pitchforks, I love Queen, but not for this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 THANK YOU WARNER
CmRih_VtVAs,Happy but wished Harley sounded like Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,wow just wow.. that was fucking badass !
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is perfect!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wish they hadn't gone quite so over-the-top with Joker and Harley.
CmRih_VtVAs,Very good Marvel film!
CmRih_VtVAs,That's another perfectly good pair of underpants ruined
CmRih_VtVAs,The moment you realize that Margot Robbie is the hottest girl in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope at the end of the movie Harley ditches the pink and blue look and takes on a black and red one, maybe a mix of her from the arkham games and from assault on arkham."
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a fucking kids movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,THANK YOU WARNER!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Moist
CmRih_VtVAs,Ahhhhhhh!
CmRih_VtVAs,we already know that batman goes after the joker. thats gonna be awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever ......
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith is literally the one thing I see being wrong with this movie. Just can't see him being a legit bad guy but here's to hoping I'm wrong 🍻
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat azz..
CmRih_VtVAs,Still not a fan of Harley... But maybe she'll wow me when I see it :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Comic-Con trailer was better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, you mean to tell me that this movie…actually makes Jai Courtney look like a good actor? XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was really hoping Harley would have that Jersey accent.  I just can't see this version saying, ""Mista Jyay."""
CmRih_VtVAs,I fcking got an erection ? Am i normal ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The song really put me in the mood, i can't fucking wait but i have to omg"
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't wait
CmRih_VtVAs,The music sets the tone of this movie quite well.
CmRih_VtVAs,Please don't spoil the whole movie in Trailer #2!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who Is Watching This On 2016 ? ( ### Fucking Everyone ### )
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope the trailer is not better than the movie itself!
CmRih_VtVAs,wheres capt boomys hat
CmRih_VtVAs,"Leto's Joker looking ""Promising"""
CmRih_VtVAs,NOW THATS HOW YOU MAKE A PROPER FUCKING TRAILER!!! QUEEN GOT ME HYPED!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rapsody - Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,1:02 EXACTLY the face of harley quinn !! this will be awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,why they have to wait so long to release this movie? i mean every scene have been already shoot and this movie already complete...
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to watch this 10 times in IMAX!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking A !
CmRih_VtVAs,Ugh...
CmRih_VtVAs,This the type of Movie you keep watching in the Theater even during a shooting
CmRih_VtVAs,"dear movie, please dont suck."
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw Cara delevingne there *sarcastic
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this looks pretty epic.  Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn  7 months away from the release and she's already stolen the whole movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I just jizzed everywhere
CmRih_VtVAs,pretty meh.
CmRih_VtVAs,If you can make a trailer like this then why do you have to make movie trailer like Dawn of Justice where you revealed the entire plot of movie.......
CmRih_VtVAs,This Trailer is better than half the movies out Right now!
CmRih_VtVAs,weeeeeee
CmRih_VtVAs,now this is a trailer!!! not like that shitty batman v superman trash
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 Enough said.
CmRih_VtVAs,I just ruined a perfectly good pair of pants.
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC movies, you finally did something right."
CmRih_VtVAs,The bad thing: Will Smith
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome. Went for a completely different feel to the comic con trailer but it worked. Exciting times lie ahead. Only 2 months till BvS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,jerod letos joker seems to sound right i wouldnt be surprised if he ends up like the ugly person which would be his try hard tattoos but has a great personality ie he acts like a good joker which hopefully will make us not care bout his looks
CmRih_VtVAs,Well since batman v superman is probably going to be bad or just okay...I have this to look forward to now
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think the trailer showed a little bit too much. Like how we see Joker diving into the vat to save Harley Quinn, i reckon they should of left that part out. Aside from that nit picking I am looking forward this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,What was that? I should kill everyone n escape?  Sorry.... it's the voices! Hahah..I'm kiddin....That's not what they really said!! lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is the Batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,awsome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the first time I'm so excited about superheroes movie. Leto, oooooh Leto...Margot Robbie is hot af. Can't wait till August."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 though
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, spoons, now I have to see this."
CmRih_VtVAs,True Perfection of a trailer this is how you do it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can already see the box office skyrocketing. Cannot freakin wait for this!
CmRih_VtVAs,"For goodness sake. Everyone is mentioning the BvS Dawn Of Justice tdailer again...
Zack Snyder himself said in an interview that the trailer DID NOT spoil anything.
And people are hypocritcally ignoring ""DAWN OF JUSTICE"". What the actual HELL DID YOU EXPECT? GOSH, people really LOVE to find flaws in DC movies."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeeeessss fucking yeeessssss!!! I've been waiting 2 years now!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait this isn't coming out till August??? That is so not fair. I can't wait that long!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG So Far away
CmRih_VtVAs,Liked the first trailer better.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so damn sexy ma gawd
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is bohemian rhapsody. QUEEN
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Emma Watson at 1:53 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I saw Cara Delevingne !!!  Furthermore, Margot Robbie seems like she'll nail it as Harley Quinn, and Jai Courtney, i also think that you may pull it off !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn everyone be fighting about whether marvel or dc is better. I mean does it matter? It's good that both companies try to one up each other because that means better movies for the audience.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THE NEW TRAIER!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,harley Quinn FTFW lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Please, for the love of all that is fluffy and multicolored,  may world peace reign until the entire DCEU movie slate gets released."
CmRih_VtVAs,im more of a marvel fan
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney distracts the hell out of me because he looks like a bootleg version of Tom Hardy. Jared Leto's Joker is fucking badass.
CmRih_VtVAs,well I just did a total 180 this looks really fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,I just had tears of joy. This movie looks incredible!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Grips
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like DC finally realized that super hero movies can be funny... better late then never
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing. You know? Props to DC
CmRih_VtVAs,DAMAGED
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking Freddie Mercury he gets me every time. Love Queen!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hurry up August! 💚
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto  still looks awful.
CmRih_VtVAs,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,My body is ready
CmRih_VtVAs,looks like wb want some of that guardian galaxy money
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the book Harley's reading?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why is Victor Zsasz cosplaying Joker in this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else feel like marvel is for kids because it's like family friendly where as DC is abit more mature and darker?
CmRih_VtVAs,After the first trailer I was uninterested. Now I'm just confused.
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks so awsome
CmRih_VtVAs,I honestly still dont see why marvel and dc fans can't accept the fact that what we are seeing is wonderful here...who would have ever dreamed we would see the avengers team up on the big screen? Then it happened now people are like oh its too many heroes and now finally dc is going for broke and i love it
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is mine
CmRih_VtVAs,Really Queen nice :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker : ""I can't wait to show you my toys""....

Dc Comics: ""its my time marvel"""
CmRih_VtVAs,where is Bruce Wayne??
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant believe how this looks so much better than Bat v Super
CmRih_VtVAs,music trailer??
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Is this the real life? Or is this just fantasy?""

I REALLY DON'T KNOW. CAUSE THIS LOOKS TOO GOOD TO BE REAL"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not saying Margot isn't hot but her looks are so overrated.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one 100% sure that this will be better than Batman v Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,what the fuck did i just watch?! This new trailer has a twist?
CmRih_VtVAs,The Best!
CmRih_VtVAs,i like that 1:58 two colors love logo between Joker and Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay...I'm really excited for this movie. With that out of the way, AM I THE ONLY ONE GETTING A GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VIBE FROM THIS TRAILER?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Best. Trailer. Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hurry up and come out already!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"pause at 1:22 and tell me thats not the joker. Because to me, that is about as close to the joker as you can get on the big screen. The Eyes that look straight through you. the smile that says I could kill you at any minute and laugh about it."
CmRih_VtVAs,hopefully this means that DC is over its edgy phase. about time they made a trailer that actually looks like a fun time
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay so, we REALLY need to talk about just how badly they've fucked up the advertising for this film. 

Trailers so far have consisted of super serious slow walks, Jared Leto looking like a fucking idiot, and still images, which have all but killed momentum for the film, as well as some incredibly stupid things said by the actors (such as Leto saying that they'll ""have him committed"" for a PG-13 role), none of which have even looked remotely similar to the source material.

Then, this comes out. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS WANTED. Somewhere, someone has massively shit the bed on showing us what exactly we need to expect from this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to see this movie😀😀😀😜
CmRih_VtVAs,what a trailer! makes one to crave more to watch the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd fuck Margot Robbie in that costume for daaayyzz !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Don't even think about going to the actual song video and say Suicide Squad brought me here, better type ""Real music brought me here"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"fuck superman vs batman, suicide squad is on some Marvel tier level of GOOD."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Some kid is gonna ask ""Song in the trailer?"". It's Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:32 
*orgasm*"
CmRih_VtVAs,MARGOT!
CmRih_VtVAs,Lovin the feel. Just watched Assault on Arkham. This is going to be better than Super vs Bat for sure.
CmRih_VtVAs,now I'm so much more excited for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm happy that jai courtney is finally acting in a movie and not acting like robot
CmRih_VtVAs,this is perfect I can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,"nnngh.  uuuuhh. mmmmhhh
cant wait that long. uuuuunnh."
CmRih_VtVAs,100/10
CmRih_VtVAs,"Excited about the movie, though I'm still rolling my eyes at the fact that they cast Will Smith. If the bits we've seen are any indication, he'll pretty much just be playing Will Smith... yet again. If they wanted to cast a black actor as a badass sniper/mercenary/cold-blooded killer, they should've gone with Keith David. I think he would've been a lot more believable in that role."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can someone tell me what that monster in the subway was??
CmRih_VtVAs,"Top 5 movies I'm excited to see in 2016

1. Deadpool
2. Suicide Squad
3. Doctor Strange
4. Captain America Civil War
5. X Men Apocalypse"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Screw Batman V Super and the Justice League, I want more of dis."
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks great! DC is going to rock!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a couple of things to say about this.....YES YES YES
CmRih_VtVAs,Waaaaaayyyy better than BvS trailer. Spot on editing. My hats off to the people who made this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,The end. 🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn that was a pretty good trailer plus having Queen Bohemian Rhapsody made it better and it got me excited to see the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"SQUEEEEEEEE!!!!!

https://days.to/5-august/2016"
CmRih_VtVAs,I knew Rick Flagg wasn't with Harley in that scene!  This trailer only makes August as it was years away. CANNOT FUCKING WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok, fine you got me. I'm a sucker for Queen."
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC: I can't wait to show you my toys
me: oh, I definitely can't wait for this"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is awesome! can't wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow! It's amazing from all of the movies that Jared Leto come out in he's awesome! He's making the Joker come to life! I honestly can't wait for August!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG
CmRih_VtVAs,It's like I just dipped my d*** into the best p***** I've ever had but she went and leave for a vacation for the next 7 months
CmRih_VtVAs,Being Bad is overrated! They didn't need to use the term 'BAD' so repeatedly in so many times there; still this looks interesting and eagerly waiting to see Jared Leto's take on Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Madre mía esto está padrísimo! estoy flipando caray!! el hecho de ponerle buena música y editarlo muy bien hizo que ya quiera verla!!
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY....SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,joder... Bohemian Rhapsody!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fucking awesome! (wish I could say the same thing about BvS)
CmRih_VtVAs,nice. civil war looks better though.
CmRih_VtVAs,What song's this?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fans be like. "" they ain't even real heroes"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who is the enemy of this movie? I can see some alien or zombie, but it is sure that the enemies are not humans."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is what you came for
CmRih_VtVAs,*Multiple orgasm.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the best use of Bohemian Rhapsody since Wayne's World
CmRih_VtVAs,No escape from Reality.__.__.__.__ SICK :)
CmRih_VtVAs,What the fuck is Clara Delevigne doing here?
CmRih_VtVAs,"huh, kinda interested now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"@Warner Bros. Pictures ""How can a movie company not upload a TRAILER in nativ 21:9 ratio? This is a 21:9 Trailer uploadet in 16:9 it means, if i watch this on 21:9 i have black barrs on the top, bottom, left and right"""
CmRih_VtVAs,varro !
CmRih_VtVAs,Orgasmic
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool 
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Lero will win an other oscar, trusth me, he is fantastic acting, singing..."
CmRih_VtVAs,fantastic DC fantastic
CmRih_VtVAs,Love Harley Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,Niceeeeeeeee well done DC
CmRih_VtVAs,what is music background ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know who or what they're fighting?
CmRih_VtVAs,895 people are Marvel Fans
CmRih_VtVAs,total fun
CmRih_VtVAs,ohh yeahhh! Joker Rules!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Only like'd cause of Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"David Ayer should have directed Batman v Superman, and Zach Snyder should have directed people to their seats in the theatre."
CmRih_VtVAs,this was just as awesome as guardianz of the galaxy trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,will she say Mr. J or Puddin ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad trailer and chill
CmRih_VtVAs,another flop
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I actually liked Jai Courtney in this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesooooom :D Can't wait anymore!
CmRih_VtVAs,Русские есть???
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm shocked that the DCEU seems to be doing actual magic magic, and not passing it off for ""science"" that's beyond our understanding. Makes me curious as to how Marvel will explain Dr Strange's abilities since they've already stated in Thor that what humans may perceive as magic is simply technology and science too complex for them to get. I just feel like if you're gonna do Dr Strange, it needs to be full blown magic, and not that ""science"" nonsense.﻿"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's strange. I'm still more excited to see Jai Courtney than the Joker.
Everything else looks awesome though."
CmRih_VtVAs,didnt really get the Harley Quinn vibe from Margot but will wait til the movie comes to confirm. 6/10 would sneak in to see it
CmRih_VtVAs,James May what the fuck are you doing? You should have your rights to Queen revoked for lending it to this garbage.
CmRih_VtVAs,Im literally gonna die waiting
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker 1989 - Where does he get those wonderful toys?

Joker 2016 - I can't wait to show you MY toys ."
CmRih_VtVAs,the voices! LOL. :D ill watching this one.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is the best part! ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Needs more Spiderman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"omg, this movie is gonna suck so fkn bad.  And all you guys are falling for the hype..."
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK THE 884!
CmRih_VtVAs,"It was a great way to introduce all the characters, still have no clue what the main plot is, but that's good since we still have like 7 more months to go, loved the song choice. Marvel better watch out!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So is Alex Mercer the ""bad guy"" in this movie?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks hella dope
CmRih_VtVAs,Suck on that civil war
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't tell if this is good or not because Queen makes everything amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,I know I haven't seen the movie yet but I'm not feeling margret Robbie as Harley quinn. the trailer doesn't really show her acting crazy enough. n I'm just not sure about will Smith.
CmRih_VtVAs,"classic mid 70s song ? check.
wacky band of misfits who are also prisoners ? check
craziest and most out of the box characters in this universe yet ? check
5 characters introduced verbally by reading out their file ? check
quips ahoy ? check
crazy action ? check.

So ... someone saw the Guardians of the Galaxy trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,Zack Snyder is the key to all of this if he isn't involved with a project that is a superhero in the DCU then the movie will not work without him
CmRih_VtVAs,Liked just for the song.
CmRih_VtVAs,What was wierd is i finished listening to Bohemian rhapsody then clicked this video only to hear it again.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, this looks fantastic."
CmRih_VtVAs,rip Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,is that Bruce Wayne with the joker on 1:18?
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is so amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol just like guardians with blue swede
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like DC and Warner Bros remembered to have fun! Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,So.... Harley's book?
CmRih_VtVAs,THE BUTT THOUGH
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet the dislikers are Marvel Fans
CmRih_VtVAs,This and Deadpool are the reason I think 2016 is going to be a good year
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeah I guess my invite just got lost in the mail.. .
CmRih_VtVAs,not a good trailer compared to the comic con one
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dunno. It will be fun to watch, but I'm just not excited about it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Freaking 1:35 would be my best friend. X'D
CmRih_VtVAs,What book is Harley reading at 0:10????
CmRih_VtVAs,I realy like this Joker ! Bravo.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it just me or did the ""voices"" part, come off really forced ... I don't know I expected cruder from Harley Quinn, though it is PG-13 after all."
CmRih_VtVAs,I SHIT MY PANTS WHEN I SAW THIS
CmRih_VtVAs,I love the humor in this
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have to say with the exception of the quick cut bit at the end, I found Bohemian Rhapsody rather distracting. But it is a great song and a solid trailer so I can't complain too much."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeeesss this looks crazy and fun SUPER HYPED!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Song fucks it up.
CmRih_VtVAs,884 ledger fanboys
CmRih_VtVAs,dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn 1:29
CmRih_VtVAs,The unknown in this trailer is metallo straight out of the new 52
CmRih_VtVAs,2 perfect trailers and 2 perfect songs.. :D :D
CmRih_VtVAs,This suddenly became more interesting than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 is the best part of this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody makes everything better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nicky & Jess from FOCUS!
..What kind of trouble have they gotten themselves into now!"
CmRih_VtVAs,meh...I'm just not feeling this at all. Will Smith doesn't seem like Deadshot and Jared Leto almost looks as though he's trying to outdo previous Joker's instead of making the role his own.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn smashing a glass window to get a purse would totally be me
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool & Civil War are the best upcoming movies hands down !
CmRih_VtVAs,The hype is real in these comments
CmRih_VtVAs,ow the edge.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is much excite
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna be a fun flick
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so excited for this movie literally I saw the comic con one and now this one and I just want to go to the theaters now and demand to see now but me and my friend have to wait till August for we are going to see it together.
CmRih_VtVAs,"RIP David Bowie, everyone will feel so bad when they see they were wrong about you playing Loki."
CmRih_VtVAs,i still wished El Diablo was played by RIck Genest!
CmRih_VtVAs,"It was alright, doesn't hold up to that first BvS trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This was perfect,  holy crap I'm so excited now this beats all the trailers"
CmRih_VtVAs,This music looks sick
CmRih_VtVAs,YES!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,More Margot Robbie. We need more Margot Robbie!
CmRih_VtVAs,"All these DC guys in the comments saying in various ways how this trailer is showing how much better this is than anything Marvel has done. Y'know, with a trailer editing style that was done back in 2014 for another movie. Except I think that movie took place in space or something.... still had the criminals though!

Everyone needs to stop acting like one is better than the other, enjoy the fact we get all these comic book movies at all, and just watch them until Hollywood moves on to another cashcow."
CmRih_VtVAs,Now...now we are headed somewhere DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesomesauce!
CmRih_VtVAs,puddin on Harleys choker lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"@Suprapto Utomo it's the trailer we all deserved, but not the one we need right now"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Of both DC movies this year, this already looks better than BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,All about 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody, classic"
CmRih_VtVAs,Soo how about you move the date to a bit sooner WB.
CmRih_VtVAs,that was actually really impressive
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait to watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody!! ^.^
CmRih_VtVAs,Robocop at the end tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"And again with DC blowing their proverbial load with yet another trailer. Stop. Showing. All. The. Good. Parts! I want some mystery left with these movies and wait to see the parts that will get a reaction from me, not pretty much look at my watching waiting for the rest to go through."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for this than Batman v Superman... how did that even happen WB?
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm excited for this movie N Batman V Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks awesome and comes out near my birthday. Gold class it is!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"A D.C. movie were the characters don't wear capes. Times have surely changed. This money has to do well, if Wonner Brothers plans to invest in second, third, & other low level D.C. characters."
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the point of Will Smith's character?
CmRih_VtVAs,i can see this being totally tryhard funny but will gain a cult following and will sell many funko pop figurines.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like a steaming hot pile of shit left behind by a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is bomb. 2:04 - 2:08
CmRih_VtVAs,Really I like It
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not familiar with all these characters, I know the big names (Deadshot, Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, and I think Captain Boomerang?) but I get the gist of the other guys, the pyro and the other ones. Im not asking for a huge backstory on each character but I hope they at least have Amanda Waller explain their names and powers while using surveillance cameras. It might annoy diehard fans but it would really catch me up on the less notable characters and invest me more in the story instead of during every action sequence in the back of my head it's a voice going ""wait who is that again? what's his name? what's his power?
Also kudos on not showing batman in the trailer. I assume he'll play a bit part in this movie but it was nice to see the focus go on the personality and individualism of each character."
CmRih_VtVAs,bravo bravo. Two muthafucking thumbs up!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The shirts in the disay Harley smashed open say ""If you want peace, prepare for war."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen?  I'm pretty sure everyone has heard this song enough to be sick of it by now.
CmRih_VtVAs,869 people are Marvel fanboys
CmRih_VtVAs,bastante chulo!
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking 864 Marvel's employees
CmRih_VtVAs,"If there is one thing I can positively say, it is that the one sure fire way to get me excited about anything is to play Queen in the background of your ads for it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Pretensious and Unfitting - The Trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Overall this looks amazing.
One good & 1 bad observation
1- Harley Quinn looks spectacular. Whether or not they wrote for her specifically to be spectacular, dunno. But she looks like she steals every scene shes in.
2- The Joker wannabe seems like a more emo version of Kylo Ren. Did they grab this guy out of some fashion magazine & put a wig & some make up on him? Didn't feel Jokerish, didn't look it except for the off coloured hair, and worse, sounded like a whiny bitch. They should have got an actor and not some fashion model with no acting knowledge,."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, this trailer sucked! It took away all the grit that made me excited for this movie in the first place. And the characters seem really cheesy and cartoonish. I'm really not sure bout this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 groot is that you?
CmRih_VtVAs,it's gonna be the best movie of the year.
CmRih_VtVAs,Chills....fucking chills...😱💉📞🍻⛏🔫🔪🔨🚬☠✨
CmRih_VtVAs,"While i was trying to watch this before it started an ad popped up







It was for this"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M ROCK SOLID
CmRih_VtVAs,Talk about sicker than SICK!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,That's it game over. This is beautiful!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Excuse me Joker, add your phone number, so I can contact you directly and influence your actions!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody ftw.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have high hopes for the DC movies.. Please don't suck. And I don't mind if its rated R too.
CmRih_VtVAs,hell... that was damn freaking awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,PERFECT SONG. PERFECT VISUALS. PERFECT CAST. PERFECT EVERYTHING.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't...stop...watching...
CmRih_VtVAs,Next movie needs to have Plasmus if he doesn't show up in this one. That would be bad ass
CmRih_VtVAs,the joker and harley quinn? o.o
CmRih_VtVAs,BvS looks terrible compared to this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"And that, my friends, is how you put together a fucking movie trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 pause, your welcome."
CmRih_VtVAs,I swear I'm gonna have more nightmares from Jared Leto's Joker than from Health ledger's Joker T-T I mean just listen to that terrifying laugh at 1:27  scares the shit outta me...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto is going to kill it as the Joker. 

They couldn't have chosen a better Harley Quinn than Margot Robbie.

Will Smith...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...then there's the others."
CmRih_VtVAs,epic
CmRih_VtVAs,Why did they make Harley's origin the reboot comics' version? :/
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Who is that?
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh man I just want this movie to come out already! August is too far away!
CmRih_VtVAs,bad ass!! 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay Okay. Alright Alright! That seems quite interesting!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is so cute
CmRih_VtVAs,I like you
CmRih_VtVAs,"Y'all are children, first trailer comes out, y'all be saying ""it's too dark, DC always makes dark movies, why not lighten the mood??!"" Then this trailer comes out and y'all complaining about ""it looks goofy, it's not serious like it should be,?!!!"" Niggas chill and judge the movie after it comes out"
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath Ledger IS THE WORST JOKER EVER! - thank you for your time.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Captain Boomerang is going to be the most stereotypical Aussie Bogan ever, and I love it"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Both trailers haven't really sold me on this idea. The cheesy one-liners are killing me, though that's kinda become the norm with super hero movies nowadays. I hope this movie proves me wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 assssssss
CmRih_VtVAs,Im not going to lie. This is hands down one of the best trailers I've ever seen. fucking dope.
CmRih_VtVAs,This might be the best trailer ever made.
CmRih_VtVAs,2.07 that ass!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Guardians of the Galaxy vibe is unmistakable with the editing of the trailer, the odd music choice, and the way they introduce the characters."
CmRih_VtVAs,Warner Bros Suicide Squad > The CW Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Superb BSO
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 👍👍👍👍
CmRih_VtVAs,Da ass tho
CmRih_VtVAs,PUTAQUEPARIU
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody!!
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 would be DC Comics year for sure...
CmRih_VtVAs,FAP
CmRih_VtVAs,are you freddy mercury trash??? 'cause i am and im 100% more hyped for this movie i originally was
CmRih_VtVAs,Trying too hard to make it look like Guardians of the Galaxy IMO.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I got feeling this is going to be a wild card to set off some intrigue in seeing can DC compete with Marvel. It's different for sure, but, it looks amazing. Everyone looks awesome; Lawton (Smith) looks like a bad, Margot has really came to her own as Harley, I'm warming up to Leto as Joker, everyone else just seem to play an important part in the group. But, theirs a small, miniscule tidbit I see . . .Captain Boomerang. Ideally, I think it would be silly if this guy was in a gunfight and was  hurling boomerangs at everyone. Though, it's part of his gimmick. It's just he didn't really show what he could do in the trailer. Except start fights with the guards. Maybe that's a precursor to him possibly being killed off."
CmRih_VtVAs,AAAAAAAHHHH I CAN'T F***** WAAAIIT =))
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney has yet to really impress me or any one else as far as i know, but the few clips of him seemed entertaining. there i said something nice....don't make me regret it."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:52 was that an angel?
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who doesn't like the look of this joker? Just me? ok
CmRih_VtVAs,this is awesome!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,what are the musics??
CmRih_VtVAs,"Amazing, best trailer of 2016 so far!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie seems perfect as Harley Quinn. I'm excited!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer was great, but HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES DO THEY HAVE TO USE THE SAME OLDASS SONGS FROM 30-50 YEARS AGO? DO POPULAR SONGS FROM THE 90'S AND ON NOT EXIST TO HOLLYWOOD ANYMORE?! If old and overused songs are in this movie, I refuse to see it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Personally, I think I'm more excited about Smith's Deadshot than Leto's Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,looks epic
CmRih_VtVAs,I was feeling pretty pessimistic about this one but now it's a full on struggle not to jump on the hype train.
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally. A trailer we all deserve.
CmRih_VtVAs,ALREADY PUMPED FOR SUICIDE SQUAD BUT WHEN I HEARD QUEEN I SCREAMED
CmRih_VtVAs,It's fucking amazing I tell you.
CmRih_VtVAs,R.I.P marvel...
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks way better than avengers 2.5 i mean civil war
CmRih_VtVAs,"guys stop fucking comparing BvS to SS. you sound like complete idiots. they are in the same universe and they are not competing with each other. Its statrting to get annoying to see haters asking the same goddamn questions after each trailer. 
Oh yea for all those people who say that the second bvs trailer made them less hype, dont watch it, watch all the other trailers"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song😌
CmRih_VtVAs,"hahaha omg dc fans this is hilarious. All of you used the first trailer to say ""yeah this will be dark and serious, unlike that joke filled disney crap"". Now it looks far worse than age of ultron in terms of quips and you're all saying ""looks so fun, can't wait"""
CmRih_VtVAs,um... where's HQ's accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know how to feel about the upcoming DC films. I like that their gritty & dark. Also I know I should be excited and I know I want to watch them. That said even with the cheesy product I actually felt excitement for Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,"~~~~~
~whos watching this in february
~~~ !,"
CmRih_VtVAs,YES YES YES
CmRih_VtVAs,My hype for Star Wars are over. Jump on the new hype train.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bummed out that Harley lacks that heavy Brooklyn accent. It's ironic that Robbie wouldn't use it, even when we know she does it so well in Wolf of Wall Street."
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 my wallet is ready
CmRih_VtVAs,i'll rate it a perfect 5/7!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG OMGIMGIMIMGIMGIG OMGOMGOMG
CmRih_VtVAs,I am calling it this is gonna be better than bvs and almost better as civil war
CmRih_VtVAs,weirdest boner ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"In the few shots Leto has, I already think he will be an incredible joker mix of Ledger and Nicholson. I like him a lot already."
CmRih_VtVAs,the best 2:31 minutes of my freakin LIFE
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel fans: don't compare their own movies but love them bc they enhance their universe
DC fans: Which is gonna be better BvS or SS or maybe WW?.....Dafuq? Be glad we're getting them, embrace them, want them ALL to do good"
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie....Better be good.
CmRih_VtVAs,this is really COOL trailer i have ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,Love that you can tell who doesn't read comics in these comments. Go back to reading your vampire books and consider DC will not cater to you.
CmRih_VtVAs,my heart is racing and I watched it twice XDDD
CmRih_VtVAs,Wtf August 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is Scott Eastwood portraying?
CmRih_VtVAs,captain america is bitch
CmRih_VtVAs,The scenes that they pick for this trailer is awesome then they add the Bohemian Rhapsody. Oh my god it's so f-cking good!
CmRih_VtVAs,This proves that DC can have a dark aesthetic and STILL be fun. Wow.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing. Hope its really good
CmRih_VtVAs,So basically DC's answer to Guardians of the Galaxy complete with 70s music?
CmRih_VtVAs,This actually looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool squad
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker? wtf
CmRih_VtVAs,That Joker laugh...OMG I LOVE IT XD 
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so happy right now
CmRih_VtVAs,how many times do I need to see Joker fall into acid
CmRih_VtVAs,EEE 10/10
CmRih_VtVAs,Wonder if captain america civil war can beat this and b v s.
CmRih_VtVAs,Shame hardcore DC fanboys wont like it coz they only like #dark movies with no humour
CmRih_VtVAs,see that marvel. this is how you make a comic book into an awesome movie. raw kick ass DC material and just a tiny bit of queen.  not like age of ultron... soft ass shit..
CmRih_VtVAs,"SORRY Joker, but HARLEY is the protagonist!QUEEN"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad = All Marvel !
CmRih_VtVAs,CIVIL WAR WILL CRUSH BOTH THIS MOVIE AND BATMAN FUCKS SUPERMAN
CmRih_VtVAs,"1- Suicide Squad/Deadpool
2- Dr Strange
3- Civil War
4- Batman v Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,fuuuuuuuucccccckkk yyyyyyyyyyyeah
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool will get a tough fight.............
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still very excited for this movie, wish they showed more of Leto's Joker! Maybe it's better to wait for the full Joker in the movie, quess just have to be patient, really can't wait to see what he does with his take on this character!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"GG Batman V Superman, Deadpool, Civil War and all the comic movies coming this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,"INB4 ""Am I the only one..."" comments
This is a fucking super hyped mainstream globally loved comic universe movie, not some obscure sundance festival movie, so stfu"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,10/10 this is even more amazing with the song
CmRih_VtVAs,"Talk about a 180 in tone shift from the last trailer. When that guy came out of the body bag and started to punch everyone I couldn't stop laughing at most of the trailer. 2016 superhero movie year, so many to go to."
CmRih_VtVAs,"May I give you all a warning...Batman, a man I hate, is reading this and preparing himself for War against Superman..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody le da un toque increible al trailer, encerio"
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:12 ""we're bad guys, it's what we do."" Never heard that before 😒"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC Universe is coming... I CAN'T WAIT!! I'M DYING!! 😨😨😨😱😱😱
CmRih_VtVAs,I'll wait for the DVD.
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST....TRAILER....EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"the Harley Quinn voice & lines don't work for me. Don't know why. Other than that, looks great!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have this feeling this spoiler consist of all the best part of the movie..........
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn!!! Tight asses are good too!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so impressed. This looks so good the first trailer didn't disappoint. This one just got me more excited.
CmRih_VtVAs,cant wait for this movie too come out
CmRih_VtVAs,This is like the Guardians of the Galaxy of DC!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Take all my fucking coins, DC, goddamn. I'm about to be broke this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,fantastic brilliant amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Thanks for ruining more stuff Will Smith.
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck the song choice and fuck the new joker's appearance. hopefully jared leto's performance makes his joker palatable
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet just saw the whole movie for free.
CmRih_VtVAs,"The music just makes the movie seem 1,000 times better"
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN!
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is awwsomeness to be tasted
CmRih_VtVAs,"судя по трейлеру, Харли и Джокер как-то не уверенно, зажато играют…будем ждать премьеры"
CmRih_VtVAs,See? Jared Leto looks dope as hell as joker! Plus I love this comical aspect of the film! Finally a DC movie that isn't like depressing for once!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The worst part about this trailer was the ending. I mean, it told us we have to wait 8 FREAKING MONTHS to watch the movie. I want to watch it now dammit!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,feel like I have too high of an expectation that it'll be a let down
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 I am Groot
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for it 😭😭😭
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the songs name
CmRih_VtVAs,aquaman?
CmRih_VtVAs,"i feel a little disappointed, the first trailer was so awsome and full of darkness, this is like a joke"
CmRih_VtVAs,pass
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody <3
CmRih_VtVAs,1:09 which is joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ахуеный!RUSSIA AND UKRAINE WAITING Suicide Squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,Gotta love Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer succeeded in making me forget the disappointment that was the teaser trailer. Genuinely excited for this now.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 and 1:29 My reaction of the people who doubt about Leto's Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody 😱
CmRih_VtVAs,No sé si aguantare hasta agosto D:
CmRih_VtVAs,yo is batman in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer ever..makes me miss heath ledger even more tho
CmRih_VtVAs,The Best minute 2:07 hahahass...
CmRih_VtVAs,The Best minute 2:07 hahahass...
CmRih_VtVAs,Say hello to the bad guys.
CmRih_VtVAs,SS > BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,Kd o choro dos marvetes? huehuehuehuehuehue😜
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC's answer to Civil War: probably just Civil War too, except replace the cast with DC characters and make Batman fight Superman

DC's answer to Deadpool: Well, Deadpool's insane on his own and does lots of comedy and guns and blades and freaky looks... let's just divide these traits of him into multiple characters, so that one person is a psycho and does comedy, one shoots stuff, one has sharp things and one is ugly as hell. There! We have Suicide Squad!

(jk jk. I love both Marvel and DC. No hate.)"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07  :)
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Sorry ever since the first teaser trailer this has been my number 1 anticipated movie of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's bane????
CmRih_VtVAs,oh god reddit is going to have the biggest circlejerk ever over song choice
CmRih_VtVAs,boooiii August. If this comes out on my birthday I'll be mad hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,I see that you have learned your lesson from the second trailer of bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,filmed in the 6ix 💯💯💯💯
CmRih_VtVAs,how about u dont reveal all the good parts in the trailer. disliked
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the best fucking trailer I have ever seen!! My friend sent me the link all I saw was ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Suicide Squad"" and I was here on the spot. I love it!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Esa canción no me latió para el tráiler. Mejor hubiera estado la que ya tenian
CmRih_VtVAs,This song is perfect for this trailer love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Keep your Avengers, I'll take my squad. VILLIANS ASSEMBLE!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Overlyhyped
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"They tried way too hard to be Guardians of The Galaxy. ""Group of prisoners save the day, classic rock soundtrack, sarcastic humor, etc"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"The color scheme used for the logo is so trippy and beautiful :D Gotta love the blue red green colors mixing up and creating a brutal combination! I do expect more from Killer Croc though, hes massive and crazy in the comics!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker : ""I can't wait to show you my toys""....

Actually is DC saying that to marvel?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still on the fence here.  Sure, it looks good...but I've seen too many movies where the previews looked good, but the movie sucked.  And then you have the whole DC declaring an internal war when it comes to their movie properties vs. their TV properties.

Hell, they ordered the producers of Gotham to kill off ""Jerome"" because they were afraid that Cameron's portrayal would cheapen the brand for Jared Leto.  And they're already trying to sabotage ""The Flash"" TV series by wanting to do a movie...how much you wanna' bet we're going to see characters like Captain Cold and other key Flash villains disappear from the TV show because the movie execs don't what their ""brand"" cheapened?

Sorry for the cynical rant."
CmRih_VtVAs,YES YES YES YES YESSSSSS!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,love it this and xmen gonna run the summer..
CmRih_VtVAs,That was completely and utterly amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Civil War vs Dawn of justice and now there is Deadpool vs Suicide Squad
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow...... fucking insane......that's original.....Much better DC.....than others..jajajajajaja.....
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for both BatmanvSuperman #DawnofJustice and #SuicideSquad to come out to the big screen. Am I the only one who likes both of these movies?
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like whoever is disliking this video...what's your freaking problem?!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like whoever is disliking this video...what's your freaking problem?!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Definitely more interested in this than batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,So are we gonna see any Joker/Harley relationship going on in the movie? Is he with or against the Squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh noooo PG-13. Whyyyyyyy???
CmRih_VtVAs,"i wonder if i can enjoy this movie evento when i dont know any of this characters , im not really into comics"
CmRih_VtVAs,love it
CmRih_VtVAs,Yeaahhhhh here is BR
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,the teaser looked better than this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever....
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's laugh really seem similiar to Jack Nicholson's laugh.
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCK YEAH
CmRih_VtVAs,Jinx is in this movie????
CmRih_VtVAs,i cant handle the amount of excitement that I feel
CmRih_VtVAs,Really expected to see batman. Bad ass trailer though. Love the idea of how they put queen music..
CmRih_VtVAs,harley :3 give me a son XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how all these marvel fanboy B#tches compare deadpool to this when deadpool is currently with fox studios and dont relate to the avengers at all stupid a$$ ppl these days, go f@ck yourself"
CmRih_VtVAs,My hype meter went up 1000%
CmRih_VtVAs,I just watched this I'm In love with this movie and can't wait for it to come out its going to be awesome Heath would have been proud rest well heath
CmRih_VtVAs,"idc about comic book movies im just here for margot robbie, damn that woman got that marilyn monroe sex appeal"
CmRih_VtVAs,The only DC film I'm actually excited to watch.
CmRih_VtVAs,who are they fighting against ?
CmRih_VtVAs,...a super-hero movie worth watching... :)  Nobody ever liked good-guys... ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,The use of Bohemian Rhapsody. Tears of joy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Isn't deadpool a white man? Where is the protest over someone of different color portraying? I guess people only care about the vice versa.If a white guy played black panther or falcon people would flip the fuck out over white privilege.  Bet Will Smith ruins the role by having the most iconic part of the character (the mask) barely ever on too, from what I gather from the trailer. Oh and Harleys tattoos look disgusting, she was kinda cute in BTAS, shame."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Never tought Bohemian Rapsody would fit so well in a superhero (well,villain) movie trailer.Looks awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,CARA IS IN THIS
CmRih_VtVAs,I was really thrown off by this.. I was listening to queen right before watching this and thought my computer glitched xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"this better not be like x men days of the future, exciting trailer but shitty lame ass movie. i'm hoping this one will live to the hype. with that being said, i can't wait."
CmRih_VtVAs,Unanimous decision... Best part of trailer 1:35
CmRih_VtVAs,so the suicide are going to take down parasite in this move? this is going to be interesting.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bad music choice
CmRih_VtVAs,"reALLY I GOTTA WAIT ANOTHER 8 FREAKING MONTHS FOR THIS???
ugh i just wanna watch it now ;;"
CmRih_VtVAs,I have never been as excited as I am about this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"first,the heroes fight each others
then,the bad guys become the heroes
what will happen next?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Im sure the movie will be good..but not as fucking AWESOME like this trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,Haha under 500k views. That wont last long. Glad I was here for it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I am in love.
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks really bad tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,"I honestly think Jared's gonna nail it he's got that demented streak, should be awesome :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,The best trailer of all the time
CmRih_VtVAs,You know what's funny? This is the first time I've ever NOT heard people complaining about Jai Courtney in a movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is doing a great job......
CmRih_VtVAs,Canım joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Stitches with the acting debut
CmRih_VtVAs,"fu*k all those people that say DC is rushing, I am so glad that I don't have to wait years to see Bvs and SS."
CmRih_VtVAs,It's striking how rock songs can totally elevate or derail a trailer. *looks at Star Trek*
CmRih_VtVAs,"To all yall saying you're confused by the the tones of the two trailers, the first trailer was really a comic con exclusive that wasn't supposed to be released to the public. Thats why I think the tones are so different for each one. I think this portrays the film's actually tone tho"
CmRih_VtVAs,"shiiit, in august"
CmRih_VtVAs,This too good.
CmRih_VtVAs,just realized harley's shirt says daddy's monster lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Poison Ivy at 1:44 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,dc marvel killed!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,First trailer was way better
CmRih_VtVAs,"so, where's bats?"
CmRih_VtVAs,The coolest shit about comic books is seeing how different artists interpret and render characters. There's always this outlash from nerds who have to bitch about every single comic book movie then cry a puddle of tears in to their papa johns pizza box.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Increíble Trailer 
Lo Ame <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,why was will smith cast in this?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ho ly shit
CmRih_VtVAs,The Best movie in This World I Love Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry but, this doesn't seem interesting to me due to the actors playing it, then there is the Joker ... that looks seriously stupid. Those tattoos gotta go."
CmRih_VtVAs,more garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope there is a back story on joker's teeth. Like he has silver teeth cause batman knocked them all out.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey Marvel, what's good?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,meh trailer from a year ago was better
CmRih_VtVAs,this better be as good as what its hyped up to be!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC bebe
CmRih_VtVAs,"another avengers in the making ""suicide squad"".... a must watch.."
CmRih_VtVAs,HNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG MY PANTS
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg im so fucken hyped! Joker in black tux laughing maniacally is the highlight of this
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking forward to seeing a new generation of kids wanting to be crocodiles and crazies. Let's start this party.
CmRih_VtVAs,Magnificent
CmRih_VtVAs,"Heath ledger best joker ?
he did super awesome in Dark knight but guys he was not joker at all. Honestly if you notice the whole trilogy was kinda criminal movie with batman characters in it and I loved it, but Jared leto is the real joker like he just got out of a comic page, that insane laugh..the voice everything is prefect.
why there is a need to even compare him to ledger when ledger was not even comic accurate. Ledger played it like 10/10, but Jared is actually playing the Joker.
Plus Leto will definitely kill it."
CmRih_VtVAs,I have NEVER been this excited for anything DC. Maybe it's the Queen but man I can not wait for August.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Stoked, stoked, stoked, stoked, and stoked."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can see all the Marvel fanboys trying so hard to hate this xD
CmRih_VtVAs,"From the second it started playing, I knew this trailer was gonna be good"
CmRih_VtVAs,why does fucking Jai Courtney keep ending up in movies i want to see?
CmRih_VtVAs,Where the fuck is DEATHSTROKE!!!??
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me are did the just fail at one upping the deadpools trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 that laugh....man I'm sold
CmRih_VtVAs,Hopefully lives up to the comics
CmRih_VtVAs,But DC isn't fun? Don't make me laugh.
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC WIN IS COMING!
CmRih_VtVAs,$$$
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuuuuuuhhhhhk yeass!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"amazing, same universe set in Batman vs Superman yet totally different tone for this film, I love it! plus great comeback for Katanna here, she's also appearing again on Arrow season 4!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Also, BvS is dark with superhero-ey stuff and suicide squad is fun with bad guys... I hope DC is not reversing Disney strategy literally..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:23 ""You Wanna Play Rough?! Ok...
SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!"" :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So wait, Harley doesn't have an accent anymore?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Any idea who that is at 01:45?
CmRih_VtVAs,"First time watching it: 'WTF did I just watch?!!!'

Second time watching it: 'Hmm maybe I was wrong?'

Third time watching it; 'You know this might actually be awesome!'"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dear God this looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,so excited for this movie!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,it's perfect...
CmRih_VtVAs,ruined by the music...
CmRih_VtVAs,margo robbie has no bottom... bad scene
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel's got competition now.
CmRih_VtVAs,02:06 Mamma mia what a booty margot!!! :-P
CmRih_VtVAs,I loved at as soon as I heard queen. I'm literally shivering
CmRih_VtVAs,We're bad guys. Its what we do. love that part
CmRih_VtVAs,If only Heath Ledger was still alive...
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie better be at least 5 hours long.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,♥♥
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Best Harley Quinn ever, fucking crazy and fucking hot at the same time!"
CmRih_VtVAs,@1:20 What kind of toys ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,I dunno why am getting this vibe that they are trying to imitate a little bit of GOTG ... a group of bad guys trying to save the world and that type of music they chose ... don't get me wrong am gonna go watch it but the difference is GOTG happened in space and this one on Earth. But theme wise seems so similar.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This was fucking awesome!!! I wasn't expecting it to be this good, but we will see them end result! Can't wait!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Nothing about this looks good.  Clearly designed for dumb people.
CmRih_VtVAs,Boheiman rhapsody <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the guy destroying the train at the 1:44 mark and again at 1:51?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney was born to play Captain Boomerang it seems. Dude stole the trailer for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain Boomerang is easily my favorite character so far. Hilarious and awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,"...ok.....

thats exactly what i thought after watching this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:53 why so serious?
CmRih_VtVAs,KATANA
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not actually sure how I feel about this. I'm excited but I don't know of how this looks. kinda confused.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer really reminds me of The Guardians of The Galaxy theme
CmRih_VtVAs,nah...Where is Harley's high pitch voice !!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well now there are hell of movies to watch in 2k16. Deadpool, Batman v Superman, Captain america, X-men, suicide squad. Oh baby !!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk who does the trailers for BVS but thats how you do a trailer without giving the whole damn movie away and still being sexy as fuck. That was one sexy ass trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The movie..meh, but god.. Queen is so AWESOME"
CmRih_VtVAs,A DC movie that actually looks good! Well done
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna fuck Harley Quinn aka Margot Robbie in her ass shes hot as FUCK & CRAZY me likey 😈
CmRih_VtVAs,not feeling it
CmRih_VtVAs,What did I just watch
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody <3
CmRih_VtVAs,DC has the worst trailers. What happened to the darkness and grittiness of the first?! Now it's some technicolor shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"I WAS LIKE ""WHAT DID I PRESS THIS SONG"" THEN I REALIZED IT WAS AN AD AND IM SO HAPPYI LOVE THIS SONG"
CmRih_VtVAs,And yet all of them got their assess beat by Batman :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn Croc look like he was about to rip katana in half. Hope they become the killer frost and king shark in this.
CmRih_VtVAs,already seen it like 20 times
CmRih_VtVAs,FUCKING. RAD.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Worst Casting Decision For The Joker, Why Can't You Be Alive Heath Ledger :("
CmRih_VtVAs,I am totally invested in Harley Quinn... Please be my lady sweetheart.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so confused on the tone of this movie based on the trailers.
CmRih_VtVAs,And now you have my attention!
CmRih_VtVAs,i bet there fighting some dumb over rated monster that could wipe out the world or wait we have a superman who is indestructible and a woman who is a warrior goddess oh and a fish man that owns the ocen but lets send the fucking criminals to maybe do some good and earn their freedom wait what happens everytime you let crazy people out DC oh yeah batman and superman have to go get them and lock em back up
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who has watched this 15 times in a row?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Out of all the recent trailers BvS, Civil war etc. this one is the ONLY one to really get me excited for the movie 

My boner is quite impressive right now"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ugh, bring back the dark tone from the first trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen makes things Epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now, that's an Oscar worthy performance!"
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,A thousand HELL YEAH'S!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR THESE LUNATICS TO TAKE OVER THE BIG SCREEN!
CmRih_VtVAs,LIGHT HEARTED ACTION MOVIE ...AKA GOTG OF DC UNIVERSE
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't see this Joker, he's ugly af"
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope to see some bomb romance between Joker and Harley💕💕💕💕💕💕
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG I CANT WAIT!
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's version of The Joker (appearance)  fits the movie quite well IMO.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sooo ready.
CmRih_VtVAs,deadpool is the only movie that can fight with this
CmRih_VtVAs,please don't have another trailer that spoils the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Not bad but not seeing a good joker here..Nothing beat heath ledger
CmRih_VtVAs,"Geez, stop with the Guardians of the Galaxy comparison. That's more a band of misfits and cowboys. The better counterpart would be the Thunderbolts.

On that note, I'd love to see anything resembling Warren Ellis' Thunderbolts on any screen."
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy Shit! Was Jai Courtney actually funny for a second? Mind-Blown!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is so beautiful, I'm crying."
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first name is Will Smith? Why because he is the most expensive actor you cast for Suicide Squad? Will Smith should be croc, cover with make up just grunt some word."
CmRih_VtVAs,No way I love this movie even more now haha
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy fuck! I am even more excited for this that I already was! I didn't think that was possible but alright.
Plus this trailer has the most perfect song choice!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Captain America Approves this shitt .
CmRih_VtVAs,*heavy breathing*
CmRih_VtVAs,my life is complete thank the gods
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SCREAMING OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,1:28 Jai Courtney's face lol
CmRih_VtVAs,What's up with all the vines? Is poison ivy going to be in this movie? PLEASE CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG
CmRih_VtVAs,"oh would you look at that, nobody has anything bad to say about Leto's joker now."
CmRih_VtVAs,That is a fucking trailer!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Look at the joker when he's in that circle of knives and guns, he has a bigger smile and NO tattoos, oh god the excitement"
CmRih_VtVAs,oh gosh. the storyline. bad guys who isn't really bad guys. I'm skeptical.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This portrayal of Harley Quinn looks fucking terrible. I have nothing against Margot Robbie, I'm sure she did the best she could with how they told her to play the character, but this Harley feels NOTHING like the Harley I know and love. Maybe the actual movie will prove me wrong... god I hope the movie proves me wrong... but so far I feel sad and disappointed."
CmRih_VtVAs,Somewhere they are still remaking Spider Man
CmRih_VtVAs,"what the fuck are they fighting i need to know or at least hve some help with it also just saying thers a giant monster destroying stuff lets let a bunch of criminals out and maybe they can kill it fuck you literally have a god living on earth (superman) and you dont at least run it by him ""hey superman i know your in a grudge match with afleck but could you swing by and rip this monster in half in like a few seconds i buy you a drink if you do that"" superman then replys with ""you know what no problem ill just fly over rip in half and we can grab a few brewskies later"". 
boom problem solved"
CmRih_VtVAs,"what the fuck are they fighting i need to know or at least hve some help with it also just saying thers a giant monster destroying stuff lets let a bunch of criminals out and maybe they can kill it fuck you literally have a god living on earth (superman) and you dont at least run it by him ""hey superman i know your in a grudge match with afleck but could you swing by and rip this monster in half in like a few seconds i buy you a drink if you do that"" superman then replys with ""you know what no problem ill just fly over rip in half and we can grab a few brewskies later"". 
boom problem solved"
CmRih_VtVAs,what is that at 1:44 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"SO AWESOME!!!! 
IM SO EXCITED !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,DeeyyyyymMM!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg...I was laughing SO hard and having a GREAT time and I was ready to start headbanging when the guitar solo kicks in. What do they do? They show Captain FREAKING Boomerang drinking a beer and burping!/LMAO Well played! However the money shot is at 2:08: Margot Robbie bending over in her short shorts. sigh..:)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow when they showed Jared Leto as The Joker, I screamed so loud my fiancé rushed to my bedroom to see if I was ok. I said ""This movie is going to be SO AWESOME!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,not looking forward to this
CmRih_VtVAs,And who exactly is the villain in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Does anyone else not like the look of the Joker in this? To me, it seems like he looks more like a 'punk' than the purple, suit wearing, proper Clown Prince I've seen before (especially the teeth. Does he have a grill or something? O.o ).

Oh well, maybe he will look better in the full movie, and it's just the trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,hahaha fuck yes
CmRih_VtVAs,"Got here before 500,000  yay...


i need a life :("
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 what the hell is that????
CmRih_VtVAs,"God ,the best trailer I've ever seen in life!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Using Queen is a cheap shot. Now I HAVE to watch it.
CmRih_VtVAs,using queen was a masterstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,it's fucking awsome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley's accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this is some fine editing.
CmRih_VtVAs,hmmmm
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm basically going to see this because I want to know how they handle Boomerang, Harley and Jared the Joker looks interesting...Boomerang looks like he might be the comedic part (other than Harley) by this trailer. Im glad they got an Australian to actually be the Australian character. Unlike Pacific Rim. But by the last teaser it sounds like they have Jai Courtney putting on a stronger ""Hollywood Australian"" accent. But whatevs!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck yea queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,Возьмите мои бабки ссуки... только блять не облажайтесь.....
CmRih_VtVAs,i guess this trailer did really sLAUGHter Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,"SPOILER ALERT,  King Shark is in this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,What an EPIC Trailer. I hope we get to watch the actual movie because in India our censor board would cut out all cuss words and all extremely violent scenes. Just hope that i get to watch the movie as it is. Cant wait for it.
CmRih_VtVAs,why does DC keeps doing this! did i just watch the whole film?
CmRih_VtVAs,Lame shit. Too bad Marvel will always be better than DC
CmRih_VtVAs,1:39 song name pls?
CmRih_VtVAs,is joker groot?
CmRih_VtVAs,i think i saw the whole movie with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"While I still believe that Leto and Robbie are good choices for Joker and Harley, this version of the characters looks horrible.
Will wait for this movie on streaming."
CmRih_VtVAs,"As long as Jai Courtney doesn't fuck this up, it'll be amazing..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This music/editing makes it feel like a comedy...
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys , it's what we do.""  Perfect line to reflect the main characters and the fact they're actually villains."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just Assault on Arkham live action? Either way still sold
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Suicide Squad **_OR_** Batman VS Superman*

*Who will win ?*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow 400,000 is pretty earlt"
CmRih_VtVAs,song name?
CmRih_VtVAs,Soo......stick Will Smith and a bunch of no-names together and throw Joker in there every once in a while? I think I'll stick with Civil War.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not bad, not bad. Still I can't help but feel it's lacking something for such a good cast. Maybe it's the editing."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen 😍🎶
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is probably gonna get a lot of dislikes but suicide squad is reminding me of the fan4stic movie in tone because the suicide squad teaser was REALLY dark, and now this is very comedic, like fan4stic when it's first trailer was dark and it's second trailer was comedic but at least suicide squad is actually funny."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can usually tell if a movie is good or bad, based on title or trailer, and feel 200% confident that this movie is going to blow everyone's balls smooth the fuck off. This is the reason it's so criminal that so many comic films have been snubbed for awards they clearly deserved. Instead, the Oscar goes to some ho-hum, uncomfortable film for being the most artistically boring or racially agitating. When you have films like this, it makes you wonder why there isn't a public poll to decide who wins. Fucking paid critics with highly subjective taste in movies decide for America, a nation of 370 million. Overruled by a small panel of elites who are likely going to ignore the rest of the world, and go with what their own dodgy standards suggest. Kind of like our Presidential elections."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is the only comic book movie I am truly excited to see this year. Civil War will disappoint, X-men will be mediocre, Deadpool will underperform and Batman V Superman is gonna be terrible."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guardians of the Galaxy called, they want their tone, story and similar music selection back"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie TRAILER looks better than any Marvel movie ever made and better than any superhero film ever created!
CmRih_VtVAs,"There has been an awakening, can you feel it? The DC movie universe is coming."
CmRih_VtVAs,Put bohemian rhapsody on mute then really analyze the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,7 months mm ok ._.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We are bad guys, that's what we do"" I fucking love Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,"How the shit is someone a fanboy of just Marvel or of just DC.  It's goddamn popcorn movies, see them all."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay i'll admit this was good, but the music choice makes me question the tone of the movie. After watching this tonally, this FEELS like a very different movie than the comic con trailer initially made it out to be...."
CmRih_VtVAs,"These new deadpool-esque ""superhero"" movies are FUCKING AMAZING!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is better than that Batman v Superman crap.
CmRih_VtVAs,"well, this is DC's answer to Guardians of the Galaxy that's for sure, the use of music, the intro of the team, and lots of action and funny one liners, I guess we'll see how well it does"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate to admit it, but my hype for Marvel is slowly dying as each DC trailer is released...."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys it's what we do! ;)"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"I haven't orgasmed over a movie trailer before, but this might be a good start."
CmRih_VtVAs,Now this looks a lot better. I hated the first teaser
CmRih_VtVAs,ITS FUCKING LIT. this looks weird and dark and wonderful.
CmRih_VtVAs,boring
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuuuuuuck Batman V Superman. I need this movie in my life!
CmRih_VtVAs,Let's see I saw Joker and Harley... That's about all I could identify. Looks like a movie to see though.
CmRih_VtVAs,cara delevingne is looking super awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer makes this movie look x50 better looking and accompanied by Bohemian Rhapsody perfects it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Goooddd I hate how they have to build up hype for months... now this is all I'm gonna think about for at least 2 months.
CmRih_VtVAs,Epic trailer hoooooo :p im so hyped for this movie...i cant wait for this epic film :p
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh my god. Boomerang is glorious.

I'm sold on this whole bloody film now"
CmRih_VtVAs,i think i saw groot..?
CmRih_VtVAs,Easily one of the greatest trailers ever made right here.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cool, Amazing,Super CRAZY!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This year is going to suck for anyone that is a dc or marvel fanboy. Im going to enjoy both sides.
CmRih_VtVAs,So conflicted about this movie ARGHH!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I so happy as fuck man 😊
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't wait... looks epic :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Like only for the musical
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks OK I wouldn't bet the farm on it being an ""awesome"" or""Marvel Killer"" could be fun it could also a heap of shit"
CmRih_VtVAs,"FUCK !! 
WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL AUGUST TO SEE IT !"
CmRih_VtVAs,That's how you do a fuckin trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks effing amazing!!!
"
CmRih_VtVAs,"If they put Deathstroke in suicide squad, it would have made this movie better."
CmRih_VtVAs,achei qualquer coisa pff
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh gawd I hope there's no love story involved here...
CmRih_VtVAs,This Harley is promising
CmRih_VtVAs,Only Waynes World can use Bohemian Rhapsody!
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith playing as... Will Smith! *terrible casting choice*
CmRih_VtVAs,"If they put Deathstroke in suicide squad, it would have made this movie better."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is better than the first trailer but I still find Jared Leto's Joker cringy as fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,daaaaamn!!! son!!! i will love this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Screw that soundtrack.
CmRih_VtVAs,500 k views in 2 hours
CmRih_VtVAs,"First teaser: ominous, dirty, and mysterious
First trailer: bohemian rhapsody"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad & Wonder Woman.. Marvels just like: ""well shit."""
CmRih_VtVAs,THNKS FUCKIN GOD FOR THISS
CmRih_VtVAs,what the name of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol DC just rekt Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,This Movie is gonna be so fucking awesome. Harley Quinn and The joker and the rest of the people look amazing. #DcUniverse #SuicideSquad
CmRih_VtVAs,I didnt like the music
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm here for the important questions like was that Cheshire and does that mean the League of Assasins will make an appearance perhaps Talia and Ra's, building up to a Batman sequel?
Just saying..."
CmRih_VtVAs,That's like my favorite song
CmRih_VtVAs,The only not gay thing about it was Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,omg... can't wait!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This tone of the second trailer is totally different to the first one. Clearly, they're wanting something which competes with Deadpool, Star Trek Beyond, or Guardians Of The Galaxy. Ironically, I do mean that in a good way because the first trailer just looked forcefully mean spirited, dark, and creepy. This time around I get a much better sense of the film's personality and...dare I say it...it kind of looks fun?"
CmRih_VtVAs,So they got the idea to play rock music I was waiting for star lord to come out wrong movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Its just perfect in every way. The music, the actors, ALL TRAILER IS PERFECT! "
CmRih_VtVAs,it is amazing....pure freaking amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,GEE MY REPLAY BUTTON IS GONNA GET BROKEN
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like Queen. I like bohemian rhapsody. And I just so happen to like the trailer....not sure if there's a correlation. I do like Queen though, lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel super disappointed about quinns voice ;-; 
I'm so use to the way she sounds in the older versions that with this.. it doesn't sound right. She doesnt sound like harley at all. Her voice, the way she says puddin' and makes cute jokes, that's part of who she's always been in any animated show or movie and now it's gone Dx"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Making a trailer with classic rock is cheating, of course people will get excited"
CmRih_VtVAs,Hated the first trailer since DC villains usually enjoy themselves and tend to leave all the brooding to the heroes. Now this is the shit I was hoping for. Looks like is going to be fun as hell :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well I got to say this is the first DC movie in a very, very long time that actually looks pretty interesting. I can't believe the super villain movie looks more light hearted than man of steel but I guess that's just the world we live in."
CmRih_VtVAs,ARE THERE ANY SPOILERS IN THIS TRAILER?!?!?!?!?!?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bad Guys, Bad Ass-ttitude"
CmRih_VtVAs,I Love Joker😚😚😚😚😚
CmRih_VtVAs,So much epic! Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I want a Harley Quinn that is deranged, boisterous and animated , not schizophrenic. Also adaptations that don't pander to the new gen shit, I pray this bombs."
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh hell yes!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Better than Dawn of justice :P
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not too sure about Harley Quinn. Her look is great, but her lines and acting make me a bit worried."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen <3
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is looking a lot better then what people thought
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm just done I don't know what to do anymore this movie is giving me chest pains.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jason Todd turned into a really good Joker after killing the real Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 OMG THAT LAUGH
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one who thinks that the humour in the trailer was weak?
CmRih_VtVAs,10/10 better than marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"Calm down getting mad about the Guardians of the Galaxy comparison.  They mean that it will work despite being such an obscure decision.  Guardian of the Galaxy is a comic no one even remembered and they made it work.
Suicide Squad is an obscure Batman branch.  That's it. That's the comparison. Not the plot. Not the tone. The obscurity/success factor."
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't think I've ever been more excited for any movie ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,your move marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,the more i see of this the worse it looks
CmRih_VtVAs,"People are being arses now.
Just appreciate the trailer and be grateful that there are things to look out for in you dull morbid lives."
CmRih_VtVAs,You have me cause you use bohemian rhapsody in a perfect way
CmRih_VtVAs,:/
CmRih_VtVAs,"WOW
SOOOOOOOOO much better of a trailer than that piece of fuck batman v superman released a few months ago"
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS MY FAVOURITE TRAILER OF ALL TIME :o
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait where's slipknot?
CmRih_VtVAs,cmon make it rated R suicide squad is fucked up in many ways
CmRih_VtVAs,
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ugh! People! Enough with all of the negativity! Let's hope both Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman will deliver. In order to have a successful cinematic universe, all DC films need to succeed critically and financially. No need to create teams."
CmRih_VtVAs,*jizzez uncontrollably until all bodily fluids expelled and my dry corpse is left to decompose*
CmRih_VtVAs,"SPOILER: Rick Flag's girlfriend is Enchantress, and both Enchantress and The Joker are the main antagonists. However, Joker manages to somehow acquire Enchantress's powers and thus, becomes the real main villain of the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,KICK MY ASS IM SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,"Then the trailer, I do not want to watch this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was very very good.
CmRih_VtVAs,THE BEST TRAILER EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,2:04 fav/fap part :v
CmRih_VtVAs,There're Leto and Delevingne. and now there's Eastwood?? oh yassh!! you got that James Dean day dream looks in your eyes...
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my god this is an awesome trailer but I'm kind of confused about Joker. Where does he come in?
CmRih_VtVAs,Once this turns out to be a major success marvel and DC will finally get their shit together and start making more movies like this... Hopefully (WE NEED A DEATHSTROKE MOVIE FOR FUCKS SAKE)
CmRih_VtVAs,all are hating on Jared cause of the way his joker looks. you should be hating on DC for making the joker like that btw Jared is a really good actor
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, what's the thematic link between Bohemian Rhapsody and this? Did they really only use it because it's a kick ass song?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"The new trailer looks cool. I really like where they introduce the new super villains are showing more details that makes them interesting. By God, do they choose the selected song, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen? That's pretty awesome. I rather hear that song which reminds the cool hit songs from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" if they chosen some cool songs in a comic book movie. The whole buildup of the entire trailer makes a little more sense since the last Comic-Con trailer looks very scary, but they change it into a fun action film. I'm pretty sure David Ayer (End of Watch & Fury) have good potential for his first DC Universe Film since the other ""Batman V Superman"" where people think that they added to much details for spoiling everything. However, it's a good coming attraction trailer for having a lot of fun with showing super villains which we never seen before. I'm probably going to see it this summer and man, it looks like they had a lot of fun than ""Batman V Superman."""
CmRih_VtVAs,First I doubted Jared Leto as the joker but he has proven me wrong and plus he was great in Dallas buyers club
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like what you got, DC"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 you're welcome you perverts
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW JUST WOW! EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dudes, this movie, like I've been saying, I love my heroes but, it's villain age of movies now! ;)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why doesn't Harley have the accent!?!?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks great, I hope the next trailer will not kill my mood like the stupid second BvS trailer did."
CmRih_VtVAs,i just bust a nut! this is fucking goooooood! where are the jared leto haters now!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was sold but no matter how much I was sold, bohemian rhapsody sold me so much my soul is tied to this movie, if it's bad I'll probably die."
CmRih_VtVAs,Deadpool approves.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, I feel like if Margot Robbie (or anyone else) had attempted to do the nasal, childish voice that Harley is known for, then most people would still end up unhappy. They would criticize any and every minor issue/difference of the voice. Although I wish Harley had the voice that she's known for, I am totally okay and can see why they decided to leave the voice out. I rather have Margot Robbie focus on portraying Harley's character and personality correctly and to the best of her abilities, than have Margot spend twice as much time trying to get the exact voice perfectly in order to please everyone."
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is damn fine
CmRih_VtVAs,All the DC fuckboys are gonna be silent after all these movies come out and they're decent at best.
CmRih_VtVAs,THE GRIN ON MY FACE RIGHT NOW IS BIGGER THAN THE JOKER'S
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 Best year ever!  can't wait anymore!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anyone had a clue who's the villain? I mean, well duh, they all villains, but you know who's going to be the bad guys here? Well yea, they are bad guys. But you know, .......fuck. I'm just going to watch the movie and find it out by myself"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder what would happen if Deadpool was able to cross over to DC and join with this crew......the Marvel and DC universe would implode with unadulterated awesomeness.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can it be August already?
CmRih_VtVAs,El mejor tráiler que he visto 👏👏👏
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm done with the DC and Marvel fanboys attacking each other in the comments! This movie looks good, but we've been lied to before, not specifically by DC, but by trailers in general. To all the DC fanboys, this movie will not be the death of Marvel, and to all the Marvel fanboys, this isn't a GOTG clone. I love both and there's absolutely no reason why you should despise one or the other. You're allowed to like or dislike movies, but you can't write off perfectly good movies because you personally didn't like them or you have some weird vandetta against the company. Anyone with a knowledge of basic film can find amazing films and terrible films from both companies. Winter Soldier was great, but so was Dark Knight. Iron man 2 was a snooze fest with no real stakes or emotion, but so was Man of Steel, or to piss off less people, Batman and Robin. Can't you just accept that both companies are perfectly fine without turning everything into a nerd Civil War?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Movies 2016, i'm going to be broke $"
CmRih_VtVAs,:v
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto! leggo
CmRih_VtVAs,Song?  pliss
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm almost shocked that Harley Quinn isn't being played by Miley Cyrus. This weird ass whacky-fun-time shit would suit her well.
CmRih_VtVAs,"what a suck joker, harly"
CmRih_VtVAs,Everybody who's whining and bitchin' and putting it down will still go see it in the theater-every last one of them.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG Rocksteady you have to make a Suicide Squad game now lol.
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome is the most epic trailer of this year
CmRih_VtVAs,Tan oscura como debe ser una película de un montón de criminales psicópatas trabajando para el gobierno.Tan cómica como puede ser una película sobre un grupo de maniáticos con superpoderes.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hello, there ! I am a consumer. I don't care if a movie earns billion dollars or not. I just watch 'em. Srsly though, you must be retarded to compare superhero movies on the basis of how much their actual earnings are (unless, you are a shareholder) !"
CmRih_VtVAs,nice style... but i like much more the last trailer's music
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing trailer since mad max !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait....
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my fucking God! Joker pulls Harley out of a Chemical Vat! ACE Chemicals?! Mad Love Origin?!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wooww
CmRih_VtVAs,"Quinn - What was that? I should kill everyone & escape? Mr J - I can't wait to show you my toys 
If this ain't true love then what is 😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC 1-0 MARVEL. Game on Marvel.. Game on..
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,"Lot's going on in this trailer. Didn't see Batman but I did see a giant Panda with a gun at 1:42. I'm sold.





Also, Leto's Joker seems very unsettling. I like it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can you guess who else is part of the 'suicide squad' ISIS!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow!!!!!!! Goosebumps!!! This is going to be awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst CGI Ever. This film is going to suck.
CmRih_VtVAs,the mood of this trailer so different then the first trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Mixed feelings. You can clearly see that almost all scenes are uberserious while the music try too hard to make it look funny and not so serious. In other words, the marketing lie is too clear."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this real life? Or is it fantasy???
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm excited! Just in general for DC. They have a bunch of movies coming down the pipe and I'm interested in seeing how Warner Brothers will make it happen. I hope they make the DCCU just as cool as Marvel's. Disney has pretty much become a monopoly. I've always been a bigger DC fan so, I'd see all these movies regardless but I'm optimistic that they will treat them right with as many projects they are making in the next 5 or so years. Cheers! 2016 is gunna be a cool year for comic fans. Let's all put down our fanboy torches and at least come together on that!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn's legs lookin' a little scuzzy in the elevator.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't. Stop. Watching.
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy Shit!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"FINALLY A DC MOVIE THAT DOESN'T TAKE ITSELF SERIOUSLY AND NEEDS TO HAVE A DARK AND MOODY THEME!!!!

ALSO, HARLEY QUINN IS HOT!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder what would happen if Deadpool were to be included in this team XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"Poison Ivy @ 1:44? So Poison Ivy took over a city and they send in the Suicide Squad to bring her down? You can see the leaves on the men that Deadshot is gunning down @ 1:47, that arm @ 1:52. @ 1:54 I'm sure that fire is aimed towards some plant (What better way of getting rid of plants than to torch them?) And they're  walking around some abandoned city like it's resident evil... who else can make ""Zombies""? Poison Ivy!"
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my god! suicide squad + queen = badass trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,wow nice! joker look sick cant wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,This proves that Zack Snyder is the real problem.
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC got more bad guys chronicles than Marvel, I think..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I will only watch this movie because of Queen's Boh Rap. Only reason. I miss Freddie
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie is shit. It killed the original characters and replaced them with dumbed down ""bad asses"". What happened to the non-sex toy mastermind Harley? Or the classy but still murderous Joker?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Movie is rated FA
Fucking Awesome!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Mostly clicked the ad because Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody.....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Let's do something fun...
Enchantress😻♥"
CmRih_VtVAs,wish Harley had her Brooklyn style accent
CmRih_VtVAs,definitely looks better than batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like the first good DC movie in a very long time!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 - DAT ASS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Snape kills dumbledore in Star Wars The Force Awakens, sorry for that spoiler"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Look at me! I'm more excited for this than Batman v Superman!""

Do we have to make this a DC vs DC thing? Both movies look like a lot of fun, how bout that?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm excited for Katana and the Soultaker, but my pop movie watching sensibilities determine she will not survive the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,And now I have a crush on Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"And only gripe...FFS, they still have that stupid ""Damaged"" tattoo on Joker's forehead."
CmRih_VtVAs,Yo I feel like harley quinn will totally steal the show XD
CmRih_VtVAs,what is the song name??
CmRih_VtVAs,Extremely Underwhelming....I'll take the comic con first look trailer we got over this thing. This just looked ridiculous. The first look actually looked incredible. I really hope its more like the first look than this embarrassment.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why did the Joker jump off the roof?
CmRih_VtVAs,I had an orgasm
CmRih_VtVAs,"So....basically this is gonna be DC's Guardians of the Galaxy.   Still wish it had been rated R though, these are NOT nice people, naturally."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fucking beautiful :D Cant wait for August to come!!! FUCK!!!! 
I didnt get that part where the joker jumps into some acid like thingy to save harley! what is that though!! Did you see his skin!!! :O Can somebody please explain that scene!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"JUST AMAZING

DAVID AYER 👏👏"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm speechless, I don't really know what to think about those tentacles in the metro. I guess I'll have to wait and see.
I think the joker looks fantastic, except for his weird lipstick, ha ha!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23 ya I definitely didn't not make this my wallpaper...
CmRih_VtVAs,"And suddenly, Jared Leto is the perfect fit for the Joker <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,el mejor trailer que vi!!! lejos!
CmRih_VtVAs,"As someone who has been disappointed in EVERY DC movie since The Dark Knight, I just got excited for a DC movie... don't fuck this up!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"We know Batman will be in this for a bit, I've heard that Superman will have a small cameo in this.  I'd like to see how Superman and Harley Quinn would work together lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,hahhaja what the hell
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS GONNA BE SO AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,This year is the best year ever!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably going to be my favorite comic book movie of all time
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably going to be my favorite comic book movie of all time
CmRih_VtVAs,Meh.
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP MARVEL :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"""This one's posessed by, what, and this one is just crazy"" lmao that was so cool."
CmRih_VtVAs,Save the world!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,"""WE'RE BAD GUYS....ITS WHAT WE DO!"" FUCK YES IT IS LETS GOOOOO!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is Harley Quinn's first live action appearance and wow if DC and Warner Bros keeps this up I will be impressed
CmRih_VtVAs,im so exited for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"""leto is too much like Heath"" I say nah fam. this guy looks like a complete full character and I'm down to clown with the new joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jizz in my pants
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Let's go save the world"" did he just really say that as deadshot?"
CmRih_VtVAs,well.....this looks fun
CmRih_VtVAs,интересно)
CmRih_VtVAs,I love itttt
CmRih_VtVAs,"AYO HOL UP
H  O  L  U  P"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto looks amazing, the rest is just eh"
CmRih_VtVAs,"so yeah, they are targeting the hot topic audience"
CmRih_VtVAs,"If the tone of the movie's the same as the trailer, then this is so gonna be best movie 2016"
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:20 ""Ican't wait to show you my toysssssss"" *slaps Asian guy*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie was born to be Harley Quinn. I haven't been this satisfied with casting since Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys... It's what we do"" 😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 & 1:52 Is that Poison Ivy??
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so cool!!! Awesome!!!!! Words can't express how impressed and excited I am for this movie. DC rules!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto's joker is going to be great but Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is going to be epic her lines are wicked
CmRih_VtVAs,Hahahaha 1:37
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat a...
CmRih_VtVAs,who is that other villain 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,Do I dare say that this looks better than Superman V Batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that Clint Eastwood's son @ 54 seconds?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, ❤️❤️❤️❤️."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I predict Fapistan 4000 based on 2:07 for fanboys across the globe, fangirls to"
CmRih_VtVAs,Okee-Dokee. Just gonna buy my advance IMAX 3D tickets now... Also FUCK YES! August is too far away! Dammit!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:29 ohhhhhhhhhhh I could watch him foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is going to be a good year!
CmRih_VtVAs,licked the first one better
CmRih_VtVAs,"KATANA looks great & glad to see that her sword IS the soultaker sword ( or so the special effect around it shows that to be the case )....NOW, what is KATANA doing in this movie , BEATS THE HELL OUT OF ME."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great trailer, super excited to see more of Jared Leto's Joker... however Harley's dialogue was absolute crap. Margot Robbie sells it but the lines are just bad"
CmRih_VtVAs,!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,ohhhh yea...
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is batman
CmRih_VtVAs,ESSE FILME VAI SER MT FOOOODDAAAA
CmRih_VtVAs,lindo.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why has no one asked why Killer Croc attacks and chokes Katana?!?!?! 1:45
CmRih_VtVAs,That thing looks like the Prototype guy.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney was hands down the best part of the trailer.

I can't believe I would ever think that in a film with Smith, Leto, and Robbie."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC might get their first hit of the DC Expanded Universe with this movie. I can't express how promising this looks. Can't wait for August!
CmRih_VtVAs,Vagina!
CmRih_VtVAs,So hype
CmRih_VtVAs,@1:37 blink and you miss Katana's eye go undead mode.
CmRih_VtVAs,2:03 anyone catch that she called him joe?!?!? Or did I hear that wrong cause if she said joe ooooo I'm ready to see a nice carved up face in the post credits
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the bad guy at 1:44???
CmRih_VtVAs,"dang, fucking awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know if anyone else liked this trailer but I sure a heck don't. I personally think the person who designed this should be fired. I was amped for this movie and now I'm worried.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jai Courtney was hands down the best part of the trailer.

I can't believe I would ever think that in a film with Smith, Leto, and Robbie."
CmRih_VtVAs,jesus christ i peed on excitement
CmRih_VtVAs,The only more than decent trailer DC has put out lately.
CmRih_VtVAs,fuck marvel the only cool superhero they have is iron man and the hulk while DC has a long list of superbadass
CmRih_VtVAs,I wonder how jared letos joker will compare to heaths in this but I feel like this movie will be kind of more light hearted
CmRih_VtVAs,And I really thought DC movies are dark and full of terror
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie was born for that role they took the perfect actress so far and her performance will be so great.
CmRih_VtVAs,Were are the muppets?
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:14 Time for Will Smith to save the world, again !"
CmRih_VtVAs,How am I suppose to watch this without having a massive boner? Its impossible.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Nice, HOWEVER. This reminded me too much of Guardians of the Galaxy. The quirky dysfunctional characters plus slap in a classic song. C'mon DC, you're trying TOO hard to be like Marvel"
CmRih_VtVAs,"... Anybody else had a weird ""Hey everybody - DC can also make a quirky movie with C-level characters most people never heard of!!!"" vibe from this trailer?

Add to this a release date in August... and the usage of 70's music (Queen!) here... and you got something right out of GoTG playbook.

I mean, there's nothing essentially wrong with that, and I'm still going to go see it, no doubt... but you ain't foolin no one here, Warner.
We can all see your thirst... and sorta understand it, actually.


...




Don't at all understand how the Joker somehow became a Suicide Squad-level threat here... but I won't judge on this 'til I see the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck. Yes.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i knew bohemian rhapsody is a great song.......but damn!,the trailer made it even better. the song was synchronizing with the trailer.. this is gonna be fucking huge, the jokers laugh....oh yeah!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 The Creation of Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,reminds me of guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,DC's animated movies still slaughter everything live-action so far.
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to drink out of Margot Robbie's toilet like a misbehaving dog.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 who the heck is that?
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait fir the new Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is gonna steal the show in this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,how can you say margot's acting is bad here?? that's honestly how harley is supposed to act lmao.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i gotta get used to harley's new voice, other than that im in love 💓💜💖"
CmRih_VtVAs,"this slayed my entire fucking life, i cant wait until august"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ok. I'll admit I'll take this over Batman vs Superman any day - but I was led here by a news article proclaiming Margot Robbie to be taking some kind of mind blowing turn as HQ. I liked the humour of the trailer - but still, nothing spectacular at this stage. Its solely and simply, I have no faith in DC and Warner. Still, it looks like it'll beat the shit out of Fox and their embarrassing repeat efforts of Fan4. I'll go see it - but not holding my breath. I guess that's all Warner want really, bums on seats in cinemas."

CmRih_VtVAs,"hopefully the only good thing to come out of this movie is Jared Leto, the rest it's fucked"
CmRih_VtVAs,you do realize once these movies come out all the 'marvel trash' will bring there cancer over here and then start making anime drawings of deadshot and Rick flag fucking each other
CmRih_VtVAs,That song choice tho
CmRih_VtVAs,"All the DC is going to own Marvel or RIP Marvel is getting soooooo annoying. Like a bunch of immature brats. Just enjoy the freaking movie, and movies. Thats it. The fan boy ism stuff the biggest turn off to the films, rarely the films themselves. Please just chill the hell out and support what you wanna see. Because the annoying fan boy stuff takes the fun out of it all. Im convinced that people hate some comic films purely based on the stupid immature fan boy stuff vs fan boy stuff."
CmRih_VtVAs,0:01 orgasm
CmRih_VtVAs,I haven't even watched the video and I already hit like!
CmRih_VtVAs,Zdem bleyat'
CmRih_VtVAs,this film is gonna flop. Harleys acting is terrible and so for the other cast. Cant they get good actors anymore?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley needs more Brooklyn in her voice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"All they had to do is ask Margot to be the lady from The Wolf of Wall Street and she would have been a great Harley. Wtf was that Margot? ""We're the bad guys... It's what we do"". Where is the attitude, the accent, the sex appeal..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why August omfg
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the girl with the pigtails super power??
CmRih_VtVAs,still re-watching the trailer... this is gonna be fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,DC is bringing it.
CmRih_VtVAs,now everyone is going to go through a Bohemian Rhapsody phase
CmRih_VtVAs,How Can I stop seeing this over and over!?
CmRih_VtVAs,God now I'm hooked... because queen's song is in this trailer... eh I'm sure I'll still enjoy it
CmRih_VtVAs,boooooring
CmRih_VtVAs,"i can honestly say the 1st trailer was better, this one was trying TOO hard to be funny.... and i like the fact that the tone was darker in the last one. .. the Joker and Hailey quinn is in it so we KNOW thier will be some comedy to it... but boy they went over the edge with this one"
CmRih_VtVAs,great trailer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
CmRih_VtVAs,"After the first trailer I was hoping this was gonna be a little more ""dark"" but that's alright still looks pretty good, a lot better than that batman vs superman movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm in. not as excited as I am for SvB but defiantly going to see this.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guys, the music is good! Anyone knows the songs' names? Tks!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"People are trying soooooo hard to find something to complain about here, lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,"did you notice the joker has earrings and gold chains, i bet the fresh prince had somthing to do with that."
CmRih_VtVAs,this and bvs will be awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,HYPE HYPE HYPE!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,dc assains are killing marvel one by one
CmRih_VtVAs,is that poison ivy they are fighting with or what? looks like a giant plant to me...
CmRih_VtVAs,клёва)
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even mind that she's not even doing the accent. It just looks like fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,I paused this trailer over 1000 times...and that was on my first viewing
CmRih_VtVAs,it's fucked mate
CmRih_VtVAs,"aaaaaah harleeeey, you're so bad and pretty 😘😍 gmz deh margot robbie"
CmRih_VtVAs,"same movie. two totally different trailers. i like them both, but im confused"
CmRih_VtVAs,I want Deathstroke in this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is that at 1:43 that is stopping the train?
CmRih_VtVAs,I just Love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks so good but Quinn looks so stupid and act nothing like how she does in the comics
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer fucking turns me on!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this trailer just lowered my expectations by about 75%
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:03 Lemme outta here, dawg. Please?! FTKJRTRUJLKUYGGKUHUHOFTDBLUYUYHTYT!!!!! HAHA"
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't known how Batman v Superman is gonna get over this.
CmRih_VtVAs,this is a fuckin _disgrace_ to the memory of freddie mercury and also to my eyes
CmRih_VtVAs,When DC degrades Marvel for having too much comedy than they do the exact same thing...Life is funny
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yesss!!! This is what the fuck I'm talking about! Now this trailer was awesome. Admittedly, I didn't care for the first one, but this has not only made up for it, it went above and beyond that. Man I love this concept. I can tell already Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang is gonna be one of my favorites in the movie. And let's not even mention Joker and Harley Quinn. I mean, it goes without saying this is gonna be their movie. One thing I'll say though is I wish they would of gave us a little bit more Joker in this trailer, but I guess these little teases just makes us want more, which is good."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks SO much better than Batman v Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Juro que arrepiou bem aqui > ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody? 10/10.
CmRih_VtVAs,Will smith shouldn't even be the main character because he like the first one who dies in the squad joker kills him
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect music.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara looks fucking sexy 😍😍👌
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot's acting is cringe next to her dialogue holy shit man
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 what the fuck is this??
CmRih_VtVAs,whhhhaa Dirty Harry is in this movie lol but really looks freaking crazy cant wait for this one & Bats vs Supes.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm at loss of words on how Dc can release a crappy batman v superman trailer than blow everyone away with a magnificent trailer like this. Bravo
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody and Jared Fucking Leto in the same trailer = Best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why send in villainous, psychotic anti-heroes, when you could send in the almost invincible Superman to do the freakin job?!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man Fuck Batman vs Superman. The original ""leaked"" trailer had already kicked Batman VS Superman's ass. This new trailer just added a kick to the face!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT YO! DC for LIFE LOL FUCK YA✊🏼
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Marry me:)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Aw, no Batman. 😔😔😔😔😔😑😑"

ヽ(｀Д´)ﾉ"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sold! How can they think of that? The song fits perfectly to every scene! It drives me crazy.
CmRih_VtVAs,I came. Twice.
CmRih_VtVAs,suggestions on whos gonna die i vote croc and boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,"""If you want peace, prepare for war""."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm kinda more excited for this than Batman v Superman rn
CmRih_VtVAs,This is literally the best trailer I've seen so far.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ball lickers B v S will own your soul
CmRih_VtVAs,If it has Bohemian Rhapsody playing in the trailer it has caught my attention once again
CmRih_VtVAs,If they would've put Heroes by Bowie this would be 10000x times better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"No podria estar mejor de lo que se ve, al parecer en esta pelicula nos contaran una historia diferente sobre harley and the joker y no la misma historia original donde ella se enamora de el en arkham"
CmRih_VtVAs,"MARVEL STILL HAS DEADPOOL FOR ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING MARVEL IS DEAD.







Oh and its rated R too"
CmRih_VtVAs,Was joker being joker at 1:29 or laughing at the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,So fucking pumped for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"The awesome force is strong with this one.  I have plenty of faith in DC.  I am so glad they are taking their own direction and not trying to copy Marvel at all.  Darker, separate universes, edgier tones, original stories instead of copying mega events that happened in comic books 10 years ago.  They are doing things slowly and methodically and I like it that way.  I know some people will say that this is DC's version of Guardians of the Galaxy.  The Suicide Squad and GOTG have almost nothing in common.  Suicide Squad, Joker and Harley Quinn are a huge part of the DC Universe and a driving force behind their success.  

This isn't a competition.  There are hundreds of millions of dollars on the line when making these movies.  Establishing a movie Universe takes time.  DC characters are totally different in terms of stature then Marvel characters to.  It's going to be a much bigger challenge to establish, but it can and will be done.  

Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Martian Manhunter are legendary characters.  Joker and Harley Quinn are legendary villains. Harley being sort of an anti hero.  Deadshot and Captain Boomerang are classic villains to.  I am really stoked.  

The one great upside to having a low Canadian dollar is that they film huge movies here.  Suicide Squad was the most expensive film ever shot in Toronto.  I am hoping DC keeps bringing movies here."
CmRih_VtVAs,OHHHH MY FUCKING GOD!
CmRih_VtVAs,Wohoo hurry up August 😁😁😁
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope this hype is not for nothing. Fantastic 4 is a good example of a Fuck up, they get you pumped up, and in the end its shit. And Don't say it's shit cause it's marvel, thanks."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the villain at 1:44 in the subway scene?
CmRih_VtVAs,Any movie that has the balls to use Bohemian Rhapsody in the trailer definitely has my attention. This is looking like it will be the most fun comic book movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie looks superior on scenes over everyone she lives the roll my perception,is own show"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm flipping shit over here I'm so excited for this. It needs to be here already!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie!!!! I'm in love
CmRih_VtVAs,Never seen bohemian rhapsody used in a trailer but my god! Warner Bros nailed it!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v superman, captain America civil war, suicide squad AND Doctor strange. 2016 will be a good year. Fuck fanboys, I love both sides!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"sori






WTF!?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great song not for this movie. Something more sinister music would have been better. Kind of took the darkness out of the movie. Maybe it's just me.
CmRih_VtVAs,captain America at :54.
CmRih_VtVAs,"So it's Captain America: Civil War vs Batman + Superman: Dawn of Justice



Then there is Deapool vs Suicide Squad 



I'm more interested in Deadpool and Suicide Squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,Cant wait to download this for free ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,already better then batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad + Queen = Orgasmic trailer of otherworldly proportions
CmRih_VtVAs,I never thought a trailer could be more entertaining than the deadpool trailer!!!  and  i am wrong..!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Whoever searches the name of the song used in the trailer, shame on you for not knowing Queen...Shame on you."
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone has some theories on what they are fighting? it seems to briefly appear in the subway scene.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Think about it, Does ""THE JOKER"" Really have the time and patience to get all those tattoos? Him in his psychotic mind set?"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 NICE
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see this MOVIE so COOL!
CmRih_VtVAs,PG-13???? Still going
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley >> Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie is amazing and I have no doubt she will do a great job, but I wish her take on Harley's voice was a little more like what we're used to. I wasn't expecting the high pitched tone, but wonder why they didn't at least give her a Brooklyn accent! It's not like Margot can't pull it off."
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN?!! I'M SO GOING TO SEE THIS.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm speechless
CmRih_VtVAs,imagine this movie if it was directed by Quentin Tarantino
CmRih_VtVAs,I've already seen this trailer 4 times. The song fits so well. I can't wait for the movie to come out.
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07, you're welcome"
CmRih_VtVAs,"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN 

:3"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jesus who did cara delevingne let fuck to get that role? Can tell she's a bad actress in just that single line she said.
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect music. Perfect trailer. Seems to be undermining Zack Snyder's no jokes/fun policy. Lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this...
CmRih_VtVAs,"wow this is even more fucked up than what i was expecting, i love it, also, using queen in a trailer is kind of cheap, queen is so fucking good that makes anything awesome, like guile's theme"
CmRih_VtVAs,joker and harleyquiin in batman movies? or its for one contract?
CmRih_VtVAs,is 2:08 Slade Wilson?
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so fucking refreshing seeing DC having a sense of humor and fun with their characters!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why is the hate culture so damned popular? Do you want to live in a world of mediocrity? But shit, you would hate that, too. What in the fuck DO YOU FUCKING PEOPLE WANT? Go find a cave and live in there."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love it! It's gonna be amazing, i think haha"
CmRih_VtVAs,take my money
CmRih_VtVAs,Omg bohemian rhapsody lol
CmRih_VtVAs,So awesome! Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS EXCITED BUT I CAN'T HELP IT 
CmRih_VtVAs,That harley quinn has to have one of the most irritating voices of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,The music goes along perfectly with the trailer and the only reason I watched the trailer was because this was my favorite song <3 (also I remember when I used to sing to this song along with my dad in the car ohh the memories :) )
CmRih_VtVAs,What a time to be alive
CmRih_VtVAs,Freddie Mercury must be proud
CmRih_VtVAs,beautiful.
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAMT BREATJ
CmRih_VtVAs,Yawn....
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see this so bad!
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:44 Is that Swamp Thing? I doubt it, but maybe...?"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:01 his hand gesture *__*
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Harley reading 50 shades of grey in there?
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be so lit🔥
CmRih_VtVAs,"better trailer than the first one, more scenes and perfect music"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody by the Queens brought me here...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh my god this looks so fucking awful. And someone had to say it. I mean really, this is going to be awful."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is that a Prototype ripe-off a 1:52?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:47 song???
CmRih_VtVAs,"LOVE THE USE OF BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY!  Hope they actually use the song in the film at some point, maybe during a big action fight sequence"
CmRih_VtVAs,what would happem with this guys at the end?.. its going to be another movie or villains of another superheroe DC movies?
CmRih_VtVAs,did they film in Chicago ?
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is freaking golden oh my goodness
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best trailers ever!
CmRih_VtVAs,I Can't Wait For Show You My Toys
CmRih_VtVAs,the first trailer made this look like a good serious movie but this trailer makes it look like a retarded piece of shit. Now this movie just looks plain stupid.
CmRih_VtVAs,Mama mia let me go
CmRih_VtVAs,Solid trailer. I'm actually more curious to see this than Batman v Superman. Now it's just a matter of seeing it and how it does as a movie overall.
CmRih_VtVAs,yikes...
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared gonna make this shit hot
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks much better than I imagined now
CmRih_VtVAs,"To be honest, it looks way better than that overhyped monstrosity that is Batman v. Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,"what's the theme song ? Was it from the band with ""Happy New Year"" ? I was born in 70s though"
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad for the win!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song please
CmRih_VtVAs,and i na't waith to see them kkkkkkkk.
CmRih_VtVAs,625 people need to be hurt...really...really...bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,Under a million club.
CmRih_VtVAs,This should have come out before BvS because it actually looks good
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY MOTHERFUCKING SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS THE BEST TRAILER I HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE THE DARK KNIGHT
CmRih_VtVAs,"For those saying ""the his is too silly for a DC movie"" um...have you ever read Suicide Squad? It is not very serious! It's funny and crazy! This trailer portrayed that mood perfectly! Come back when you've read the series."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Everything about this looks amazing! Jared Leto looks perfect as the Joker (sorta New 52, I guess), Will Smith as Deadshot was one I was worried about but he looks great. Even Jai Courtney I'm predicting is going to be fantastic as Captain Boomerang."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anal
CmRih_VtVAs,... Ven aquel punto en el firmamento... es Marvel Comics que acaba de irse a chingar a su madre
CmRih_VtVAs,Somebody else thinks that Will Smith shows a non apropiate Deadshot's personality?
CmRih_VtVAs,so hyped!!! That's all I can say.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Way to ruin a queen video, now we are gonna see a bunch of 2 year olds on Bohemian Rhapsody's official video proclaiming where they heard that song."
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG CANNOT WAIT... and yeah sold.
CmRih_VtVAs,"A much better trailer than last one

this trailer is more crazy black comedy than ""dark"" teaser trailer 

good choice Warner Bros"
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's Deathstroke!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is why being bad is so good.
CmRih_VtVAs,DC's Guardians of the galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,Quiero ver a batman no a hancock
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEENNNN
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do people have to like either Marvel or DC? Why not both?
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM SO FUCKING READY.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh my god its so good it seems like its very ""cool"" and good written and the shots ste Amazing , this will be such a good fit in for their Universe. But what i don't understand.... Why... WHY on the fucking Planet Marvel fanboys came Here TO hate. Like theyre the worst persons... Dont shit on our dream because youre scared that dceu will ne better. A big FUCK when you came here only TO hate. :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is anyone else surprised at how much Jai Courtney embodies boomerang?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like a masterpiece. A dark, twisted comedy. Props to DC and WB. I was gonna watch but I might just be more excited for this than BvS."
CmRih_VtVAs,more excited for this than bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,This joker kinda reminds me of ronald mcdonald
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking epic.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well aside from Joker's design (still not a fan of it) and this version of Harley not having her Brooklyn accent, I'm sold. Killer Croc looks great to see as well. This, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, Batman v Superman and Deadpool; this looks to be the biggest year of the superhero genre yet!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Incredible. Makes me wanna see it even more.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wasn't expecting that at all!  Bring on The Suicide Squad!
CmRih_VtVAs,You had me at Margot Robbie ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like the Suicide Squad will be better than Batman vs Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEN GOT RAPED BY SUICIDE SQUAD!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,geoff johns? Thats why it feels and looks this way
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank god this looks good. I was worried after the Batman V. Superman trailers. Glad to see at least one director actually respecting the source material.
CmRih_VtVAs,"*""I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU MY TOYS!""*"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So good. So, so, so good."
CmRih_VtVAs,Spring Breakers + Guardians of the Galaxy + Joker = Profit?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared is a GREAT actor.  Itching to see how he measures up vs Ledgers Joker.  I think the lad will give it a good show.

Rest of the trailer looks AWESOME too xD


ADAM BEACH, my man!  Represent!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG! AWESOME TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,who`s watching this for the fifth time??
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this is how you do a trailer! Looks better then BvS....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Before I watch this, is this trailer full of spoilers?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so sold right now
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, Harley's character is gonna be gold. But seriously, I'd rather she wore something less booty shorts. Maybe its my personal preference, but I find those kinds of short shorts to be less than attractive, to say the least. I think she would look cooler, and it'd be more utilitarian, if she were wearing something like Cargo pants or something, rather than some kinda tiny leather shorts that literally serve no purpose other than to expose her to the elements and possible inclement weather. 

Not to mention the aforementioned disgust I feel when seeing tiny shorts. Somethings should be best left to the imagination in my humble opinion."
CmRih_VtVAs,Worst movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,its aiiight 😆
CmRih_VtVAs,Eita porra
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is hot as fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well I wish she used the classic Harley voice....like the Batman Arkham video game series.  I can't be the only one thinking this.  I can honestly say I am still not sold on what the teaser and now this trailer show of Harley.  Comes across as half assed portrayal IMO...However I will reserve judgement until I see the movie in its entirety.
CmRih_VtVAs,"and they're off! triggers here, offenses there, circle jerk all around. regular movie goers having a good time oblivious to the drama unfolding in basements across America."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im just not a fan of letos joker so far from what ive seen. The grill makes his classic smile just look straight whacked. he looks like marlyn manson. It doesnt feel like the joker. I get it, its its own incarnation. But it should still feel like the joker. It seems like a different villian that resembles the joker. The joker is supposed to be charismatic, this joker just comes off as a pure nutcase that im not drawn to at all.  To me the joker should be insane but intriguing and entertaining. So far this joker seems repulsive. The hair too looks way to artifical. I know im complaining alot but hey its legitmate things that just look off. And course the damaged tattoo on his forehead lol....  Harley quinn I like alot though. And in all honesty we really have barely seen any of the joker. maybe it will blow me away on screen in the full movie. This is just my initial impressions...not like anyone gives a shit lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel sucks
CmRih_VtVAs,okay I'm horny
CmRih_VtVAs,"Batman v superman and this? I think DC is making a comeback, I mean batman dark night was awesome but that's about it.."
CmRih_VtVAs,"In 2016,I'm going to be broke as fuck."
CmRih_VtVAs,МНЕ ПОХУЙ МОРОЗ! Я В РОССИИ РОС!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best part of the trailer 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,I kinda wondering about the bright neon text and that weird looking destruction in the subway
CmRih_VtVAs,"We are bad guys, this is what we do lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,"much like everyone else I'll always have my own favorite version of the bat man world and who voices them. that being said, I love all the different takes on the bat man world, so I'm excited to see this one. Will definitely be seeing this in the theatre."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara is such a shitty actor
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie has that crazy cute/cute but crazy thing nailed down it would seem.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks so much better than Batman vs Superman, sorry Batman v. Superman"
CmRih_VtVAs,I didn't want this trailer to end. But it must
CmRih_VtVAs,Deathstroke would kill this sad piece of shit Deadshot. Where is Deathstroke!!
CmRih_VtVAs,IM SO FUCKING PUMPED
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the point of Margot being in here? Does she have any skills or anything? I don't get it.. Please Explain...
CmRih_VtVAs,PUTA QUE ME PARIU TAVA FALANDO DESSA MUSICA HOJE THIS GAVE ME FUCKING DEEP CHILLS DAMNIT
CmRih_VtVAs,MARGOT ME MATA DE ME FODER
CmRih_VtVAs,"The acting looks bad. The actress playing enchantress is hideous. Even her character looks like the grudge. Do they even know the comic exists? Making it seem like a school play or something. Only really excited for Jared Leto and Harley Quinn (trying way too hard to be the stereotypical ""crazy girl"" tho). This can either be the best movie or just plain trash."
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie looks fine as hell!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best comic book movie trailer i've seen in the last few months, and that is actually saying a lot!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I wasn't sure about this movie, mostly because I didn't know anything about suicide squad,but I'm getting very hyoed about this and that surprises me!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What is this a movie for villains?
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I just came...
CmRih_VtVAs,"I fucking hate Bohemian Rhapsody. There, I said it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does the fresh prove have to be in this movie?? smh.
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit! This is awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks awesome I so need to go see this when it comes out!!
CmRih_VtVAs,@2:07 though.
CmRih_VtVAs,Brilliant. Just brilliant. This looks insane and now I'm stoked for it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I honestly can't wait for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Hashtag ballin!
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen just fits this trailer perfectly. Legendary music with a yet to be legendary film.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Basically the Enchantress is going to turn against the Squad and Captain Boomerang's acting is going to ruin every scene he's in. But other than that, Hell Fucking Yes."
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen 💛
CmRih_VtVAs,i didnt know they cast Hot Topic as the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be the best movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,It's....fucking beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my.... this looks awful. And way to ruin such a great song!
CmRih_VtVAs,Complete garbage.
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto´s Joker is THE Joker I´ve known from the comics =D
CmRih_VtVAs,THE POWER OF A CLASIC!! QUEEN!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"No deathstroke?
:((("
CmRih_VtVAs,Definitely looking forward to this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Where was Ultron Guys. ?!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,i was sold with the first trailer but this is amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Still don't like the tattoos but I think Jared will be a great joker
CmRih_VtVAs,lol. I like it. hahshs.
CmRih_VtVAs,"To dislike any video that contains ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is retarded at best lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,this us the most beautiful thing i have ever scene including scarlett johansson. wait i take that back
CmRih_VtVAs,can anyone tell who the guys at 1:48 are?
CmRih_VtVAs,am I the only one who hopes Koller croc isn't human sized he needs to be huge like in the Arkham games
CmRih_VtVAs,^_^
CmRih_VtVAs,Negative comments!?!?! Fuck all of you!!! This shit was beautiful!!! I'M PUMPED!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Now THAT is a trailer!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks kinda cheesey ""we're the bad guys that's what we do""  that's some grade A top notch writing right there"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who or what is the Men In Black character they are fighting? The one on the subway, what is that?"
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS MY DREAM I LOVE THE BATMAN VILLIANS
CmRih_VtVAs,When Joker jumps into the vat of acid for Harley. Omg.
CmRih_VtVAs,wtf was that Groot looking thing? The one that got hit by the subway?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Good way to keep cards close to the chest. Still a long way to go till August. But yeah, I'm curious. Still more stoked for Batman v Superman as an event like that doesn't happen everyday but this has my attention."
CmRih_VtVAs,perfect!
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling this will definitely become my favourite movie of all time.
CmRih_VtVAs,stupid song ruined the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am absolutely 100% fucking sold. Was always sold, but now. Fuck. No way this film can suck! No way!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Might be spoilers but this is just speculation but at 1:44 some weird looking guy is there, then at 1:52 we see a tentacle from seemingly the same guy, and at 1:58 Joker looks kind of weird and broken. Maybe those Jason Todd as Joker theories were true and this draws from Dark Knight Strikes Again where Dick Grayson becomes a shapeshifting Joker looking thing.  Might be possible."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can we not make this marvel vs dc? I just wanna see some epic ass superhero movies! This looks great!! Enjoy the times we live in people!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,AHHH. TOO SCARY! I'M LOOOOOSING MY FUCKING MIIIIND
CmRih_VtVAs,BOHEMIAM RHAPSODY CARALHO
CmRih_VtVAs,"............Well, I cant ever listen to Bohemian Rhapsody the same way again.......
This movie looks worse than I ever imagined."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't actually like DC, but I'm going to start to LOVE IT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith might win an Oscar....oh wait
CmRih_VtVAs,Me gusto mucho ♥
CmRih_VtVAs,Why So many colours?? Am I missing something??
CmRih_VtVAs,"After the BvS Dont forget clip and This,,, 
My Body is Ready for some DC ..."
CmRih_VtVAs,I am soo pump for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"PERFECT PERFECT THEME SONG!!! 

ACTUALLY JUST A PERFECT PERFECT SONG"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait but what's the rating?
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel sorry for those people who disliked this trailer XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else catch DC k   ixz at 0:27?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,yo en este momento: Como una niña de 15 años el día de  celebración de sus 15
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ayy, that's pretty good"
CmRih_VtVAs,dear Joker I cant wait to show you my Toyz too.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sorry but you had me at the song
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know if I love this because is good or just because bohemian rhapsody...
CmRih_VtVAs,The only reason I want to watch this movie: Margot Robbie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Just one question.... Harvey Dent.... Can we trust him?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still not a fan of stripperella Harley or meth king pin Joker, at least look wise"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks dope
CmRih_VtVAs,SOOOOOOO AWESOME I AM TELLING YOU THIS AND DEADPOOL WILL BE THE BIGGEST FILMS OF THE YEAR
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bueno, a mi parecer esta película y Deadoool serán las mejores del Año ♥"
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked the music too. Who are the singers of the trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,"If all of  this year's movies are coming like this one, then I'll have nothing to complain about u.u #SuicideSquad"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks unique and cool. I had cautious optimism for this movie, before this trailer. Now, it's just pure optimism. I'm sure the tone of the movie is not that close to the trailer, but lets hope so anyway, because it looks like fun. And that's how you fucking make a trailer BvS! That's HOW!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. That's seriously got to be one of the greatest trailers I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,shout out to all my homie imgurians
CmRih_VtVAs,if this isnt awesome ill punch a baby in the face lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Beyond impressed. This looks amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,People!!! Just because you like Marvel movies doesn't mean you have to hate this. Being a big Marvel fan myself and not a fan of Man of Steel I fucking loved this trailer. It is amazing. Buuuuut we kinda had something similar in Guardians of the Galaxy but hopefully this is as good or better than Guardians
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY. CRAP. BALLS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The song choice made me smile and laugh throughout the entire trailer.  Idk what I'm feeling, regarding the actual movie, must watch the trailer a few more times..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Boomerang gives no fucks!
CmRih_VtVAs,my question is who are they teaming up against!?!? that's the biggest thing there this movie is going to smash the box office!
CmRih_VtVAs,I really hope that they are taking on the Joker. Would love to see Harley Quinn beat the shit out of him.
CmRih_VtVAs,"DARK, FUNNY, ACTION PACKED & HARLEY'S ASS.... SOLD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"That's it.  Tattoos, metal grill, and all I'm sold on Leto as the Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,how the fuck can 600+ dislike that amazing trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yes, they won"
CmRih_VtVAs,look fun
CmRih_VtVAs,More pumped for this than Batman v Superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,"That one scene with the joker shooting his gun looked really cringing. I'm still not a fan of his ""teeth"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it just me ... Or everyone's today seems to be *VERY* easy to impress ... Just look at all the HYPE with SuperManVSBatman ... now nobody likes it ...
CmRih_VtVAs,god damn jared leto sure looks like he put in work as the joker LOL 1:23
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF is that thing at 1:44 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"this just, i dont like it. Since the first pic of the joker that i dont like it. I just cant see Leto playing a the Psycopath Clown, i dont like the look, the laugh, the goddamn tattoos (i hate them, it ruins the character)  and the car. I cant, i just cant deal with it.
And the movie in general doesnt gets my attention since i really never liked the Squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I cant wait to show you my toys"". I may sound immature but I couldnt hold it when the joker said that. I wonder what kinda of toys. No wonder he didnt want to rev up his harley. Besides that fact I think the joker has some pretty interesting clips in this tralier. Cant wait ! DC ALL THE WAY BABY!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I had to rewatch this again just to remove Arleen Sorkins' voice in my head... I wanna watch this movie. I hope it doesn't disappoint... :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Brasil aqui
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is like a crazed, schizophrenic version of Guardians. 

TAKE ALL OF MY FUCKING MONEY"
CmRih_VtVAs,you had me at Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"possibility of groot in movie 1:40, 1:50"
CmRih_VtVAs,life goals: watch suicide squad. that's all I need.
CmRih_VtVAs,This that shit right here!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Told myself I would stay away from trailers...but when Bohemian Rhapsody started playing I had to stay.
CmRih_VtVAs,name of songs used in trailer please?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm looking forward to seeing Harley Quinn!!! OMG Margot you slay me!
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is coming early it seems
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley quinn that's all I wanna see 😉😉😆😆
CmRih_VtVAs,Liked for Bohemian Rhapsody love 😀😀😀😀😀
CmRih_VtVAs,me enamoreeeee
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer made me love Harley Quinn more and more!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm a Marvel & DC nerd fan. This trailer gives me mixed thoughts on how the movie will turn out
CmRih_VtVAs,If will smith doesn't win a  Oscar for this then I will not watch the Oscars like I do every  single year. LOL  I can't believe in 2016 anybody besides old people still care about that crap. I rather fall asleep watching a reality show. lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,"just when i want to headbang like Wayne and Garth, they cut to Boomerang opening a can."
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop smiling
CmRih_VtVAs,ok im sold
CmRih_VtVAs,ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. HOW IS IT THIS FUCKING GREAT. #PUMPED #CANTWAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is how BVS should have done it. Show us stuff, but leave us absolutely clueless as to what is going to be happening."
CmRih_VtVAs,Its the best thing i ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,that. was. beautiful.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jajajajajaja DC KOMIXZ
CmRih_VtVAs,AUGUST 5th!! WHAT???!!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT LONG!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one getting a Christina Bell vibe from Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,"SO effin awesome, shit all over sups bats"
CmRih_VtVAs,Do they not have their spaceship this time?
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok that was fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,Loving the new Joker for some reason.....
CmRih_VtVAs,The first trailer was so good it set the mood to be dark and serious. It looked to be another epic just like the dark knight. But then there's this. What are you trying to do with this movie? Make up your mind DC are you trying to continue with your other movies and be just as dark or are you trying to be more like Marvel and be more comedic?
CmRih_VtVAs,"So everyone knows, the thing in the subway is Incubus. Enchantress summons it with her dark magic."
CmRih_VtVAs,In the wise words of Deadpool... Cue the music.
CmRih_VtVAs,EPIC. I literally love the Squad and The Joker. Got no complains.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm already liking this more than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,578 noobs who just googled suicide squad today.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This actually looks really stupid.





I can't wait to watch it."
CmRih_VtVAs,"30 minutes ago you couldnt pay me to watch this movie. 
I will chalk this one up as a success for whoever cut this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,So who's the bad guy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Saints Row: The Movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"I actually WAS going to give Leto an opportunity! ...
...
Was ...."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Im more excited for this then Batman V Superman. Trailer was excellent, getting a guardians vibe from this."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, I had an orgasm"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like it's gonna be a good movie. But god could they have picked a movie annoying song  ""to meeeeeeeee"" ick."
CmRih_VtVAs,gotta admit this is pretty good
CmRih_VtVAs,ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
CmRih_VtVAs,would have been better if killer frost was in this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,So is The Thinker gonna be the villain in this film?
CmRih_VtVAs,Take my money.
CmRih_VtVAs,Liked it before I saw it
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared, Margot and Will are EVERYTHING!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"From what I see SO FAR, I'm not impressed with Harley at all"
CmRih_VtVAs,AHHH OMG IM SO EXCITED
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,Take notes Batman v Superman marketing team: THIS is how you make a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"*sees harley Quinn's ass*
My reaction:........... I'd smash..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oooooohh, DC is actually going to give Marvel a run this summer.  That's a nerd win in my book!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why did they try to make this trailer comedic?!?! The first trailer was way better, this one is just......"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hype went Skyrocketed for Leto's Joker, but slightly dipped for Robbie's Harley.
(due to lack of accent)"
CmRih_VtVAs,me likey likey :)
CmRih_VtVAs,This could be the best movie ever or the worst garbage in the world
CmRih_VtVAs,Still think this joker looks like shit and am not a fan of Harley Quinn's look either.
CmRih_VtVAs,Lol @ DC fans
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dare I say it, but Jai Courtney looks entertaining in this movie"
CmRih_VtVAs,Parabéns...amei esse trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Pause at 2:08 Thank me later.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen 😍😭
CmRih_VtVAs,Nice :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"looks good, I'm sold!"
CmRih_VtVAs,YES.  Just yes to everything.  Extra credit for putting in Queen 👍

CmRih_VtVAs,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH EU VOU GOZAR
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG I can't wait to see Margot Robbie in this!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cannot. Fucking. Wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,After this trailer DC owns Marvel. Right?
CmRih_VtVAs,isnt this the same plot of the animated movie
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well she might not look like the Harlequin we know, but she definitely talks correctly."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody, you guys. Bohemian Fucking Rhapsody. Marvel just got Bitch slapped."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Jared Leto's joker is going to suck so bad""- Everyone


Me-"".................."""
CmRih_VtVAs,this is so cool but I kinda of hope it's a dark movie not funny
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG .. THIS IS THE REAL LIFE?

CmRih_VtVAs,Oh yea so gonna be good
CmRih_VtVAs,Es tan hermoso *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you really pay attention to it, they combined Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger all in to one to make this beautiful creation of Joker."
CmRih_VtVAs,EL PUTO AMO
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide Squad + Queen = One bad-ass lookin' trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is amazing. So refreshing to see a DC movie with humor.
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so ready!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,where is the Batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Im so fucking stoked.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is seriously one of the greatest trailers I've ever seen!  So well put together!  And Queen!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Anne Hathaway made a terrible cat woman 

I'm fine with Margot Robbie being Harley quin 

But I hate this joker, the look, the laugh, he dosent even have a painted on smile for God sakes, I'm sure Jared is great I just don't like this squalor version of him. 
Earings really?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Great music for the trailer. Margot is amazing crazy))
CmRih_VtVAs,Uhu! !!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect....
CmRih_VtVAs,nope.  the acting is bad.  maybe i'm just sold on seeing them work together.........Does Harley bother anyone else?  I'm sorry   *leaves
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn smoking hot!
CmRih_VtVAs,this is a better trailer than batman v superman. No spoilers.
CmRih_VtVAs,"10/10, I would tap dat..."
CmRih_VtVAs,A little better than I expected. I guess it won't be that god awful?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like the best comic book movie of 2016 to me ... And harley looks FUCKING YES
CmRih_VtVAs,Sweet Christmas
CmRih_VtVAs,....okay i am honestly fucken like.....lord BRING AUGUST TO US NOW!!!!😅😅😅
CmRih_VtVAs,I find it funny that the girl who plays enchantress plays scarlet witch. Essentially the same damn character but one is good one is bad hahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,harley quinn's lines are cringy as fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,Waiting for Marvel fanboys....Can't wait for this movie !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,puta shortinho ó
CmRih_VtVAs,im here for harley quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Batman v Superman fails, this actually looks like it could save the franchise."
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is the Bat?
CmRih_VtVAs,Love this but what's it gonna be about? I know maybe Harley's origins but who's the villain? Batman is in this movie. Is the squad after the Joker? Is the Joker scenes only flashbacks? If it's only flashbacks then that's dumb. I rather see the squad doing their own thing and the Joker doing his own thing. Then later the Joker just fucks around with squad and snatches Harley up. Idk what to expect lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not one for super hero movies...but holy shit!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,why can;t i stop fapping to this
CmRih_VtVAs,"this looks fucking awesome solid stuff  .

CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody my favourite song ever
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks promising. Needs better soundtrack tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,Aquaman!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"..........Watch it on mute it looks a lot better, more dark and less Guardians of the Galaxy comedy like......"
CmRih_VtVAs,dear god PLEASE let that be Dick Grayson! PLEASE! 0:54 aka Scott Eastwood!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm so exciting!!! 
Amazing, spectacular, ahhhhhh!!!!!"

CmRih_VtVAs,i guess SS and Deadpool take the cup home
CmRih_VtVAs,Heck yah I aready saw the cartoon but I want to whach this so bad

CmRih_VtVAs,"want to see this more then the batman vs Superman movie

I knew I would like Harley but Boomerang looks pretty cook here.  He knows he's a fuck up and he just doesn't care."
CmRih_VtVAs,If something makes someone so stigmatized...  then this trailer makes that exponentially exotic... WoW..... Hats off to the crew go making this reality of dream....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sometimes when I'm alone, I scratch my butt hole and then sniff my finger."
CmRih_VtVAs,"hype, hype, hype.... THE FUCKING HYPE"

CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is shaping up to have a beast soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks better than Batman V Superman. Now the Suicide Squad movie has to live up to this awesome trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's either gonna be really good or it's gonna suck really hard. I don't think there will be a happy medium.
CmRih_VtVAs,"What was that? I should kill everyone and escape?"" - Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just came all over my self bruh
CmRih_VtVAs,Sign me up

CmRih_VtVAs,They should had Harley's voice like she had in wolf of wall street with that Brooklyn  accent
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys.""
This line sold me for some reason."
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad ????  Too much greatness in one year!!!!   Doesn't Marvel have some type of movie coming out ? lol The names slip my mind. Oh well......  DC UNIVERSE BABY!! lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh shit... Marvel's gotta up their game

CmRih_VtVAs,oh my god yes
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07. You're welcome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't Fuck'n Wait! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,That's how you make a trailer! I'm feelin Harley and surprisingly captain boomerang may be my favorites.
CmRih_VtVAs,"idk about Harley, she doesn't really look like a psychopath"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, 2016 is lookin to be a great year for movies 😎"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Youtube Film Critics/Reviewers beware, for the trailer reaction requests are coming..."
CmRih_VtVAs,MARGOT & CARA
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Haven't smiled at a trailer in a long time. Looking forward to this :-)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Uma verdadeira bosta, esperava muito mais"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Before anyone makes a comparison of ""Suicide Squad is DC's Guardians of the Galaxy"" let me just stop  you right there, there's a ton of difference between these two movies. 

Yes Guardians of the Galaxy had criminals as the lead characters doing some good stuff but Suicide Squad on the other side is the ""true villain based movie"" they are not just criminals they are bad guys who fights the heroes/good guys on regular basis.

Guardians banded together and did good stuff because they had personal motives and to save the galaxy but Suicide Squad is forced to work against their will. 

We never see guardians fighting Avengers because they aren't villains they are just criminals but on the other hand these villains from Suicide Squad are known for going up against the heroes we know and love and thus DC's Suicide Squad is the first ""villains movie"" in comic book movies front."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I going to watch this? Yes, yes I will. And so are you."
CmRih_VtVAs,Guys think about this for A second how the comic con trailers music was about starting a joke it was a metaphor for Harley and Joker starting a joke which in turn means anything from terrorism to breakin social norms. In this trailer the music and the song represents a man guilty of murder and forced to either life in jail and punishment or the death penalty. The parallels the characters lust for freedom and redemption. Whoever is choosing the songs is a genius and needs a raise. Keep it up DC you getting your shit together. Big-time.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't fucking breathe Ahhhhhhhh the perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer of 2016 already im calling it everyone else GTFO
CmRih_VtVAs,waited for so long for the new trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"it's so good I can't even.. oh dear 3 :)) August, hurry the eff up!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't know how much I've pressed the replay button!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The Joker vs. Suicide Squad in a game of ""Who dies first?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Where does this play in the batman canon?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, DC is taking Marvel's advice!!!
You've finally learned to make a movie that has some f#$%ing fun, for once. Enough of the dark stuff and more of this!
I'm loving the GotG vibe, too. Can't wait to see this."
CmRih_VtVAs,I was so sceptical of this when I first heard about it but now... it looks pretty damn good. Will be this year's Guardians' of the Galaxy. The film no one said would work but ends up kicking major ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,"They fücking did it, BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bay bay marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody. wow.
CmRih_VtVAs,We are bad people
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can it be? A DC film that doesn't take itself way too seriously for once?!? OH, HAPPY DAY!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Good song for a good trailer for a hopefully good movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think Star-Lord gonna sue somebody.

Joking aside though, I love both Marvel and DC (anybody who claims they like one and hates the other is the equivalent of a guy who says he likes cake and hates pie. They are both delicious dessert treats, and you know it) and I can't wait to see this movie. I think it looks great!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks like Suicide Squad will be DC's Guardians of the Galaxy, which is good. I think the direction they're taking here is awesome, and exactly what DC films have been lacking lately. I'm really excited for this one"
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy has a rival
CmRih_VtVAs,DVD..
CmRih_VtVAs,From what we've seen so far how do you think Jared Leto is going to compare to Heath Ledger's joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Best pairing of a song and trailer ever...
CmRih_VtVAs,"If I know Warner Bros. well, only the Joker, Harley, Deadshot and maybe Killer Croc (cause it is a Batman villain and all these current WB filmmakers in charge of the DCEU are Batman fanboys) will receive some good character development. The rest of the Squad looks and feels really meh and it will probably die before the movie ends."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who the fuck would thumbs this down?
CmRih_VtVAs,this what I'm talking about in your face marvel. this is going to be fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,КРУТОЙ СУКА ФИЛЬМЕЦ БУДЕТ !
CmRih_VtVAs,Best use of this song EVER!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm literally crying out of happiness.
CmRih_VtVAs,"That's it, I'm sold on Jared Leto"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the deal: kill everyone
CmRih_VtVAs,tesão
CmRih_VtVAs,That was awesometacular!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear comic gods, please make this a hard R. Harley Quinn and the Joker look amazing, don't waste that potential. Please consult with Deadpool before editing, and 2016 will be the most glorious year for nerds ever."
CmRih_VtVAs,im not a fan of this movies but can anyone tell me what is suicide squad is like who r they
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to see
CmRih_VtVAs,Well this doubter has been converted.
CmRih_VtVAs,"One word. MADNESS, and I love it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I came
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm ALREADY SOLD ON THIS JOKER!! .. This New age Joker has my vote.  He looks exactly how a 2016 joker should look.
CmRih_VtVAs,Can I just grow up to be Harley? Please? XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my...GOSH! That was awesome! Jarred Leto is really growing on me and your choice of music is impeccable.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I just had a brain orgasm. And ummm fuck marvel too...
CmRih_VtVAs,"God dammit, I've been making fun of this movie for about a year now but this actually looks like it'll be pretty good. Hell, even Leto's Joker seems like he might be fun, if it weren't for... That tattoo... Which is all I can focus on... whenever he's on screen..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it me or does this actually not feel like a DC movie? Because usually they're more dark...
CmRih_VtVAs,omg I almost forgot about this movie but now I'm excited
CmRih_VtVAs,This is amazing <3
CmRih_VtVAs,BADASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Favorite trailer ive ever seen so far
CmRih_VtVAs,YES YES YES!! THIS IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok this LOOKS INSANE! My new number one
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:18 ""I can't wait to show you my [*choke*] toys."" Did he forget his lines..?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who does Cara Delevingne even play in this film?
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably the most lively I've seen Jai Courtney
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker looks 👌🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,it smells PG 13....
CmRih_VtVAs,I bet thats either Ragman or Spectre at 1:44. They should definitely introduce one of those guys if Enchantress is one of the main protagonist.
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman Vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,its Like GTA = meets DC
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like a blood relative of Guardians of the Galaxy! Can't wait to see it!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"eeeh I like the 1st trailer waaay better, this seems a little weird with the music"
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG the song is freaking fenamenal
CmRih_VtVAs,IM CRYINGG YES
CmRih_VtVAs,mama mia mama mia MAMA MIA MAMA MIA
CmRih_VtVAs,I like how everyone is so serious at 1:09 and Harley is like a little girl on xmas day! XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit, it seems a lot of people come from the future here 'cause they're all ready telling if the movie is good or bad"
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07. awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,His laugh.... That's when you know shit has gone real.
CmRih_VtVAs,i see cara. unexpected
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG YAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 I think that might be Brainiac.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's literally like people are trying so hard to hate this trailer and deem this movie a disaster. I'm honestly done with the comment section and the amount of negativity being spread, people won't ever appreciate anything at all."
CmRih_VtVAs,Edgelord: The movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,Thank god Zack Snyder has his filthy hands off this.It looks way better than Batman v Superman

CmRih_VtVAs,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 👏👏👏👏👏
CmRih_VtVAs,"não tenho mais estrutura depois desse trailer , imagina o filme .. Jared❤"
CmRih_VtVAs,Anybody else more excited for this than Batman v Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,oh look a DC trailer that doesn't reveal everything on the movie before it comes out
CmRih_VtVAs,who/what was destroying the metro? & does anyone else think the Enchantress will be the main baddie
CmRih_VtVAs,man this was a fun as trailer reminded me sooo much of guardians of the galaxy trailer its deff the DAWN of DC
CmRih_VtVAs,They had me at Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,"villain IS GREEN, gold accents, Who can it be?"
CmRih_VtVAs,melhor trailer de todos os tempos!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"My dreams r coming to life 
This movie and Batman v superman r going to give me a heart attack"
CmRih_VtVAs,I love how Captain Boomerang is cracking a tinnie like an Aussie legend at a Grand Final party
CmRih_VtVAs,segura essa marimba monamuuuu!
CmRih_VtVAs,Tears of joy
CmRih_VtVAs,Never wanted more in my life to be August
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,whats the song please some one tell me
CmRih_VtVAs,After months of stressful gameplay videos of grand theft auto Adam Kovich lost his sanity and killed his fellow FunHause members and has been incarcerated and inducted into the Suicide Squad. You can see his turmoil at 0:17
CmRih_VtVAs,Rad.
CmRih_VtVAs,I hate Queen.
CmRih_VtVAs,terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is the true Dark side, take that Disney and marvel"
CmRih_VtVAs,why in the FUCK can't people like DC AND MARVEL HOLY SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy crap. This cannot come out sooner.
CmRih_VtVAs,Mmmm ya perdi la fe en esta mierda
CmRih_VtVAs,i guess the editor had too much fun making this trailer... #notcomplaining
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm looking forward to this more than any other movie in 2016. Yea I said it.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen made this even more perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,Caralho essa porra vai ser muito doida
CmRih_VtVAs,honestly. the best trailer for any movie ever
CmRih_VtVAs,This brings me joy
CmRih_VtVAs,I am whelmed. Not overwhelmed or underwhelmed just whelmed. Bohemian Rhapsody is the best thing about the trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"People criticizing the movie already by a fucking trailer.

Shut the fuck up and enjoy it you sad fucks."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone notice the fact that she breaks the fourth wall at the end........ kinda pricking at Deadpool.
CmRih_VtVAs,LETS GO.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hahahahaha wtf Is this shit?! x""D looks like a series crossover shit !!"
CmRih_VtVAs,YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY its here baby !!! DC god bless you
CmRih_VtVAs,isn't the Eyeball head guy at around 1:22 a Marvel villain? or does DC have their own eyeball head person?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Be funny Will Smith gets nominated for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it crazy to say that this looks just as good if not a little better than Batman vs Superman? I didn't think it was possible but this looks gooooddd..
CmRih_VtVAs,I take back everything i said to Jared Leto.. now i'm sure he'll nailed it.. This is amazing!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The more I watch this trailer the more greater it looks
CmRih_VtVAs,The song Bohemian rhapsody made the trailer more awesome!!! Cant wait to see The Joker and Harley Quinn!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I just wanna said heath ledger is than better Jared because the make-up of heath it's perfect and most real the best joker HEATH ❤️ but Jared does not bad I think he does wonderful but not perfect and I like jared my singer😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Это же ахуенно
CmRih_VtVAs,who do i have to kill to see this movie jared kicks fucking ass as the joka
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks really good in this. But nothing beats Heath Ledger's performance
CmRih_VtVAs,"WORST. HEROES. EVER. 
BEST. TRAILER. EVER."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Alright, I'm officially sold and excited. The initial reveal trailer had me intrigued. This one now has me hyped, can't wait to see it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,David Ayer is a genius
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. I'm speechless.  Just. Wow.
CmRih_VtVAs,#CivilWarFTW
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my goodness this is fantastic. David Ayer you killed.
CmRih_VtVAs,i can't stop but think everything margot does in this movie is going to seem out of place. just doesn't feel like she got the character.
CmRih_VtVAs,at least this new trailer doesn't have a Big F#ck!ng Steroidal Ninja Turtle-ish spoiler.
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad + Queen that's great
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that's a fuckin epic trailer right there !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Maybe it's good that DC has that *No Joke* rule. Still, the movie does look kinda fun."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Great Job DC, now no more trailers for this movie. Let me be surprised don't make it like Batman v. Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody!
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto looks amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,Best part at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope the film will do this trailer justice! Awesomeness!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"The new joker still looks bad, but Will Smith seems like he will be great in the movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,cadê os br ?
CmRih_VtVAs,best use of Bohemian Rhapsody ever
CmRih_VtVAs,I never thought i would say this but if you gave me the choice to see this or BvS right now i would totally wanna see this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my god...this was fantastic. Queen laid over the trailer doesn't hurt either. I'm already in love with Harley and Boomerang. Is it bad that I am more excited for this than BVS? Just marginally.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bruh real talk this trailer was gonna be amazing the moment I hear Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,Yessssssssssssssssss
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well. This looks terrible. They somehow made Will Smith have no charm, the Joker look and act like one of the actual Joker's henchmen, and Harley Quinn a completely boring fake psychotic hot chick. Killer Croc also looks just kind of like if the Hulk and the Thing mated and neither parent wants to claim it as their own."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Surprisngly, I liked this trailer better lol. Great edit to QUEEN! I like the casting (besides Will Smith - love his acting but kind of always the same role)."
CmRih_VtVAs,Are all of you f'ed in the head?  This looks terrible!  I was literally finishing people's lines before they said them because of how generic this garbage is...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh. My. Woah.
I never. Ever. EVER would've expected them to get it this right.
I cried. I'm not kidding. My first time watching this I literally cried.
This is now my most anticipated film. 
Step it up BvS. "
CmRih_VtVAs,It's sad there's more people in this comment section that would recognize Justin Bieber's voice but not Freddy Mercury's.
CmRih_VtVAs,"It looks like Jai Courtney has finally broken free of the ""most boring actor ever and poor man's Sam Worthington"" curse, which can now return to its rightful owner, Sam Worthington."
CmRih_VtVAs,This is so much better than the comic con trailer that released last year. omg.
CmRih_VtVAs,didn't give nothing away  brilliant marketing
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Not gonna lie, that shit at 1:44 looks CGI as fuck and scare me a little for the future of this film."
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:40 I'd say "" bam! equality"" but i would probably get so much hate..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else notice Ghost Rider villain The Orb at 1:22?  I can't be the only one who noticed him.
CmRih_VtVAs,shut up and give them an Oscar
CmRih_VtVAs,and my hype for this just surpassed my hype for deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,Kanye's version would be better. 
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else spot batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,❤❤❤❤
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shyt! dC going to be killing the game now
CmRih_VtVAs,this is how u make a trailer...looking at u...supermanvsbatman
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does will Smith look  like the black guy from black ops 3
CmRih_VtVAs,better than the first trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,2:05 i like 😏😏😏😏😏
CmRih_VtVAs,dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,They overdid it on Joker's makeup. Still excited nonetheless.
CmRih_VtVAs,I miss Tara Strong's Harley's voice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, this is not what I want to have pop up in my head when I listen to Bohemian Rhapsody :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is almost like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", and I really mean that like a compliment. It gave me essentially the same feeling that Guardians did. Similar trailer music, comedy gold, and if anything, this will be Guardian's devilishly charming twin, an awesome movie that focuses on the dark aspects of criminals instead of the light."
CmRih_VtVAs,"FUCK,  and i have to wait till august :("
CmRih_VtVAs,ughhh august is so far away!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,So many things so wrong. It's just sad. Looks like pure garbage
CmRih_VtVAs,I am actually looking forward to Jay Leto's performance
CmRih_VtVAs,oww shit im inlove in this trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:19 Wasn't that how al-Qaeda came to be? Whatever, the movie will be awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman vs super man sucks compared to this
CmRih_VtVAs,omg DC
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG!! THAT'S SO COOL AF!!
CmRih_VtVAs,my goodness did you hype me!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Tom Hardy was almost in this movie GODDAMMIT!!
CmRih_VtVAs,MARVEL IS BEST
CmRih_VtVAs,RUMOR:Scott Eastwood is playing Jason Todd aka Red Hood in this film.
CmRih_VtVAs,But... I thought DC wasn't aloud to have fun
CmRih_VtVAs,Literally every shot after 1:36 looks super interesting to me. This trailer makes BvS look like a side project.
CmRih_VtVAs,so whos gonna be the villain in this movie? (no pun intended)
CmRih_VtVAs,HOOOOOOOOOOO YEA 2:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  SOY MUY FAN
CmRih_VtVAs,My God!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I have to admit this is a radical tone shift and Ty Lee from previous commercials perhaps due to the fact that it got so much criticism with the other trailers promoting it as being so dark and gritty that I decided to lighten up the tone
CmRih_VtVAs,meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Undoubtedly best movie of 2016!
CmRih_VtVAs,I was grinning like nutso while watching this and even bouncing up and down in my seat. This is going to be good!
CmRih_VtVAs,"FOOOODAAA!!!! ""NO SCAPE FROM REALITY"""
CmRih_VtVAs,NO NO NO NO! Geez this trailer is great
CmRih_VtVAs,Not enough jar jar
CmRih_VtVAs,So who is the bad guy...joker?
CmRih_VtVAs,I was born in Arkham Asylum fuck up place but it home
CmRih_VtVAs,It's so dense. Every frame has so much going on.
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is such a good actor
CmRih_VtVAs,someone must be working on a videogame based on this
CmRih_VtVAs,Now THAT'S how you do Bohemian Rhapsody. Take that Wayne's World!!
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLYSHIT BALLS!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"woah.....what the fuck!
This is awesome"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love watching pom
You that read wrong
You read that wrong too
You read that twice to make sure you didnt read that wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,And she's just crazy...I'm going crazy to see this movie. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"Suicide Squad and Deadpool, What more can we ask for? So hyped"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I have to admit, I'm really starting to come around on this movie. It just looks genuinely fun, and choosing Queen was literally perfect. I am still skeptical on the Joker's design (not so much Leto specifically) but hopefully everything turns out great. Love the shot of him laying down laughing his ass of surrounded by knives though :)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks awesome. Like and wanna see.
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna see Jason Todd!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Yessss :3 Harley Quinn O3O
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS AND DEADPOOL WILL BE THE BEST RATED R FLIMS OF 2016 YOU CAN BOOK IT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, the used my favorite song for the worst movie of 2016 and probably of all grime"
CmRih_VtVAs,"CADE OS BRASILEIROS PRA MOSTRAR QUEM QUE MANDA NESSA PORRA.
#SUICIDESQUAD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"damn you DC, here...just take my fucking money! **tosses wallet**"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie 😆😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Bye bye marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm gonna cry, this is so dope"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song fit so perfectly
CmRih_VtVAs,I prefer the previous trailer :/ 100 % better
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat Ass!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm ready bitches 
💪(  ˙-˙💪 )"
CmRih_VtVAs,Civil war and suicide squad are my most anticipated movies for me.
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought Joker sucked but he's not that bad
CmRih_VtVAs,Harleeeeeeyyyy 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,"I read somewhere that Margot was doing Harley Quinn's accent 'on set' and then I see this, and it's not there. That really bums me out."
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks pretty good.
CmRih_VtVAs,I am so in love😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:36
""Well I'll take a soda while these motherfuckers kill each other."""
CmRih_VtVAs,People who says Margot Robbie will not make a good Harley how the fuck u know did you seen the movie.LMAO Stop being Marvel fan boys for a second get your head out of Marvels ass and realize DC is taking over this year with great movies.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If Will Smith doesn't get an Oscar nomination, Jada is going to tell everyone to boycott the Oscars again, but still show up anyway."
CmRih_VtVAs,David Ayer you fucking legend.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is basically what the Purge movies should've been like: Having fun being bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,I think Will Smith is going to kill it
CmRih_VtVAs,"First trailer had be curious...

But this trailer, using my favourite song from from my favourite band....Here, have my soul.

Good marketing Warner/DC"
CmRih_VtVAs,WHY WASENT THIS THE FIRST TRAILER?!?! <3 idk the movie could be awful still (who knows) but DAUM... this trailer has me hyped.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is freaking beautiful# this is the scarface of our generation, actually doing its own damage/carnage to society."
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks sick
CmRih_VtVAs,love it
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST HEROES EVER
CmRih_VtVAs,"caralhooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo vai ser foda demais 
BR AQ"
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfection right here
CmRih_VtVAs,The 500 that dislike this are going to hell
CmRih_VtVAs,"Me on First Viewing: Looks Interesting! :)

Me on Second Viewing: OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!! IS THAT ALAN MOORE'S SWAMP THING, HOLY CRAP. I am super excited!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"So glad it's not ""so serious""!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really had my doubts about this movie, but that time has come and gone, what a well put together trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm gonna love this movie, right?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie comes out on my birthday
CmRih_VtVAs,"I feel like this movie is perfect for the riddler, where the hell is he?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I came alittle watching this ._.
CmRih_VtVAs,Poop ! If I was deformed I would give it 6 thumbs down. ... Not for me.... I'll just stick to watching Heath Ledger as the best Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,Dahsyatt..
CmRih_VtVAs,2016: The Year DC took back the keys to the kingdom from Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,the other trailer was better in my opinion
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen makes everything better
CmRih_VtVAs,WoW! cant wait to see this movie. Will smith jared and cara my faves.
CmRih_VtVAs,SQUAD GOALS!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The trailers so far have been amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is how you make a damn movie trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen+Harley Quinn= best movie of 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,I am going to assume/hope that they tried the Harley Quinn voice and realised it didn't work with Margot's voice/accent.
CmRih_VtVAs,Another One
CmRih_VtVAs,What happened to bat man? (•~•)
CmRih_VtVAs,no hans zimmer no party
CmRih_VtVAs,What did I just watch? 🤔📝 hoping for the best
CmRih_VtVAs,So gooood
CmRih_VtVAs,"is that guy with the green hair supposed to be the Joker? Seems somewhat different than from the 80s suicide squad, and Waller is supposed to be heavy set. 
Looks kind of interesting, though..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Cadê os BR?
CmRih_VtVAs,¡The best trailer 😱
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fingers crossed they don't kill off any of the badass female characters just to give emotional distress or show how bad, the bad guys are."
CmRih_VtVAs,Take all my money.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so crazy it has to be fucking up the space time continuum somehow. Excessively epic
CmRih_VtVAs,Who the hell is the dude at 1:44 shooting the subway???
CmRih_VtVAs,August. Fuck.
CmRih_VtVAs,THE avenger (the first) will always be the best super hereo movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone know who that is that the subway drives right through at 1:44?
CmRih_VtVAs,dying of laughter when Boomerang opens the can of beer hiding hahaha
CmRih_VtVAs,why does it always have to be about sex?
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Were bad guys, It's what we do."
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked the Comic Con teaser better.
CmRih_VtVAs,That's why dc's trailers rocks over the marvel's trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,yes! can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer just send shivers down my spine...
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP MARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,meh.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie Nubian White Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just putting this out there, Suicide Squad comics came before Guardians of The Galaxy. Stop comparing the two. GOTG was awesome but this looks amazing too and you know it."
CmRih_VtVAs,damn men!! is very nice
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm expressed with the Harley Quinn so far. And I can't wait for the movie
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED TO GO TO FUCKING REHAB CUS IM ADDICTED TO THIS TRAILER
CmRih_VtVAs,Shaping up to be a killer movie. But why the long wait?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:55 Diablo sacrifices himself
CmRih_VtVAs,idk this seems kind of lame then again all DC comic movies are lame
CmRih_VtVAs,<3 Margot Robbie <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What was that? i should kill everyone and escape?... sorry, the voices. I'm kidding, thats not what they really said"""
CmRih_VtVAs,...meh
CmRih_VtVAs,Cute purse.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, and too think batman locked all these guys up."
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks pretty good actually.
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok.... This looks promising. Now give us a Rogues movie. Please?
CmRih_VtVAs,holyyyyyy fuck i cant waitttt harley quinnn and enchantress <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Loved the trailer,but one question, in 1:57 is that ACE chemicals?"
CmRih_VtVAs,This and Independence Day: Resurgence. 2016 is 1996 in movies.
CmRih_VtVAs,hype
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even like Queen and I loved this musical selection. What a trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared leto as joker my god, waterfall"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I like where they took it. Like what a lot of people just said the hearted take. I'm excited plus deadpool. I feel like these will be movies I will see twice in theaters. Serious is good but I felt like if they kept going any more serious they would implode on itself.
I don't even mind the stupid tatoo on his forehead at this point either"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer has a very Guardians of the Galaxy vibe to it. No doubt DC took a lot of inspiration from that film's trailer when making this.
CmRih_VtVAs,wow. surprised. looks pretty good.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the greatest movie trailer I've ever seen in my life
CmRih_VtVAs,Still waiting on my OWN sequel...
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF was that?
CmRih_VtVAs,200 DAYS AND I GET TO SEE HARLEY ON THE BIG SCREEN!!! WHO ELSE IS HYPE?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is that metal guy controlling the train is that metello
CmRih_VtVAs,For MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG. I cant wait for this movie :)
CmRih_VtVAs,I'd hit like 1000 times if I could.
CmRih_VtVAs,this got me way more hyped now for the movie but Harley Quinn doesn't feel like Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,Bai bai deadpool ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,uufffff perfect *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck you... Take my money...
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't know Scott Eastwood was in this
CmRih_VtVAs,gracias gracias por estoooooooooo
CmRih_VtVAs,you are going somewhere bery bad. ....
CmRih_VtVAs,Me Likey!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,looking forward to this more than that X-men. ...movie
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer has given me all sorts of hype.
CmRih_VtVAs,Alucinantee!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What is that thing in the subway?!?!?!?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Woman with the mask & katana, is that Tatsu?"
CmRih_VtVAs,AMAZING YESSSSSSSSSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,We're bad guys!. That's what we do.
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel Y'all ready for a real movie DC is in the muthafucking house
CmRih_VtVAs,Ohhhhh damn August better come soon cause my body is sooo ready
CmRih_VtVAs,Epico!
CmRih_VtVAs,Not comforting that this trailer is practically marketed as a comedy.
CmRih_VtVAs,¡No te pases! Me encantó.
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley's going to ruin this movie. They turned her into an edgy scene kid.
CmRih_VtVAs,Idk what I'm looking forward to more bVs or this 😫😫😫😫😫👌🏽
CmRih_VtVAs,I have an erection.
CmRih_VtVAs,**********spoiler alert:  the Joker is actually a reincarnated Robin from Batman V Superman aka Jason Todd!!!***************
CmRih_VtVAs,name of song!!?
CmRih_VtVAs,Jokers not that bad
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't usually get too hyped for DC movies, but this looks AWESOME"
CmRih_VtVAs,Love it.  I just hope Harley quinn has other better lines than this... cant wait to see otherwise :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker and Harley Quinn will steal the show.
CmRih_VtVAs,I have dry skin and they didn't cast me as the crocodile ... This is discrimination against dry skinned people
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love DC and Marvel for very different reasons but DC I must ask, Why the actual fuck did you do that to joker! I mean I actually like the little change up with Harley but you messed up on joker big time! That just does not embrace the true character of the joker! To me it looks like a really bad punk joker cosplay!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"will dc actually make a franchise to rival marvel, FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON SUICIDE SQUAD"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:52 though. her hands look almost deformed
CmRih_VtVAs,meh...looks good but i like the first trailer better because it was more Dark and like mysterious which make sense because they are bad guys well Villains but this trailer :/ seem too comedy for me like too comedic like its a funny movie. All an all im still gonna go see it but the First trailer was better in my opinion.
CmRih_VtVAs,yay more joker omg cant wait until this summer :)
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the same as batman vs superman cause this looks so much better how is it made by the same company ahah
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking. Hell. Yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,0:01 MOTHER FUCKER. BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. I CAME.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG!
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks dope ! what's up with the funny songs ?I hope it's not a comedy thriller😑
CmRih_VtVAs,okay im sold!!! this actually looks good now jared actually acts like joker at some parts!! wow this will be fucken good i cant wait to see this! and wow will smith pulled off deadshot
CmRih_VtVAs,199 Days away! 😀
CmRih_VtVAs,The Best trailer 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody, haciendo lo épico aun mas épico que pedazo de trailer y que pedazo de pelicula se viene carajo."
CmRih_VtVAs,I just had the best orgasm of my life. Fuck...
CmRih_VtVAs,I fainted 42 times watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,comic book movie fatigue? I think not!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer=Win!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I fainted 42 times while watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope Jared Leto appears for more than 10 minutes
CmRih_VtVAs,*-*
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks better the Batman vs Superman!! Queens song was a perfect choice
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith feel a bit out of place...shoudl've used a less established actor...Joker...I dunno, no one can replace Heath Ledger..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome action flick with bad humor?
CmRih_VtVAs,I fapped  8======D~~
CmRih_VtVAs,The song its perfect.  The trailer its perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,The music they used just made it a 100 times better
CmRih_VtVAs,I approve this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Still more exited about batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,hell yeah 👍
CmRih_VtVAs,And they didn't give away too much! Awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can see Deadpool having an orgasm to this 😎
CmRih_VtVAs,why can't people wait till the movie is out to say this or that one is better? can you actually judge a movie just by watching a trailer? I don't think so. And what's the need of turning everything into a competition?? Leave that to the studios and just enjoy the movies ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,5th Viewer!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,QUERO
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh FUCK YES IM READY
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG OMG OMG OMG OMFFGGGG! 
Cannot wait to see ma man Jared. THE Joker! How great is Margot!? They all smash it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"OK, now I've seen some decent length footage, I think I'll actually give it a try."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 the heart
CmRih_VtVAs,That actually looks really good.
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched it like 7 times. Gonna watch it for the 8th time now..
CmRih_VtVAs,ALL ABOARD THE FUCKING HYPE TRAIN!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now, what am I supposed to do with my life until August 5th?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"i know i am going to get hated on this comment but after watching this trailer i forgot all about deadpool. i was more inclined to see this for it fits so well with everything about the movie
dont get me wrong i am going to watch both but dam these two movies will be neck to neck just like batman v superman and civil war."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'll take a double order of Harley Quinn, yes please."
CmRih_VtVAs,It should be ilegal to replay a video as many times as I did
CmRih_VtVAs,So Much No.
CmRih_VtVAs,"My biggest gripes are Joker's weird look and Harley's voice. Otherwise, looks promising."
CmRih_VtVAs,Im more hyped than before. Jared Leto`s Joker looks really good and im glad that the movie those seems to have a some laughs.
CmRih_VtVAs,we're bad guys that's what we do
CmRih_VtVAs,Please don't.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Welp, I'm fucking sold."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more hyped for this than any comic film coming this year. It looks like SS is going to be amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer has just beat out anything that Marvel has ever brought to theaters.
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one that noticed the old ass Twitter logo at the end?
CmRih_VtVAs,"You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention."
CmRih_VtVAs,YES!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,My most anticipated comic book movie this year.Trailer was awesome <3
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is a masterpiece.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Am I the only one who's not pumped up for this movie more than Batman v Superman?!

***place meme picture here***"
CmRih_VtVAs,pretty good. at least it's different
CmRih_VtVAs,brainiac attacking the train?
CmRih_VtVAs,My heart
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks good no doomsday so yeah excited XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow. People can't wait to follow the herd and shit on BvS regardless of these being supporting films. Judging by the comments I've gotta be the only one shaking my head at all the ""looks so much better than BvS"".  So sad that no matter what BvS does people want it to fail just because."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley. Quinn.
CmRih_VtVAs,IM TOO EXCITED HALP!!!!1
CmRih_VtVAs,this will destroy batfag v superman even if they r dc
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes times infinity. Wasn't expecting it to look THAT good.
CmRih_VtVAs,This was.. unexpected... and unexpectedly good... Helps that it didn't give out much either.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG!  Bohemian rhapsody!  YES!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks like Suicide Squad vs The Joker. Hopes Joker gets to off a few off them in the process. Also, looks a heck of a lot better than Batman vs. Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,joker's laugh at 1:28 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sorry replay button, we'll be doing this a while"
CmRih_VtVAs,Go Cara )
CmRih_VtVAs,A+
CmRih_VtVAs,Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad will make my inner DC fanboy complete and very happy.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dude... CARITA 😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,omg love joker leto
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ya know what, it's a pretty good trailer. But man, are my instincts screaming at me to disassociate from a movie that's going to attract the most embarrassing, socially-inept fans ever gathered in one theater. This is the future of Hot Topic, guys."
CmRih_VtVAs,"DC's Guardians of the Galaxy, LOL !"
CmRih_VtVAs,increible... lo ame maldito jared!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, it's what we do!"" 

I'm so excited to see this! Mainly because of Viola Davis, but yeah, now I'm excited for everything!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"*Everyone, place your bets on what members of the Suicide Squad will make it out of the movie alive. Joker doesn't count.* My guesses are...

- Harley Quinn
- Deadshot
- Rick Flag
- Katana
- Killer Croc
- Captain Boomerang"
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beside loving, it reminded SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR Comic-Con Red Band Trailer. I hope it won't have similar fate."
CmRih_VtVAs,So perfect
CmRih_VtVAs,puase at 0.25 at set speed to 0.25 they spelt comics differently
CmRih_VtVAs,AHAHA THAT WAS EPICLY GAWDLIKE GOOD
CmRih_VtVAs,I want to see this now
CmRih_VtVAs,watched it once and screamed and then watched it the second time while pausing every few seconds to grasp every scene. omfg im so excited i died and came back to life. i might die again
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm sorry but this is horrible in my opinion. It seems like this was intended to be a comedy. These are not how the DC villains are/act at all. Haven't they read the comics, watched the movies/shows, or even played the games? They should know that no human is capable of performing such characters. Only voice acting and animation can bring them to life. The best thing I'm getting from this is the fact that the girl playing Harley Quinn is sexy in costume. That's it."
CmRih_VtVAs,HALLELUJAH!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,SO FUCKING AMAZING!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Who Is That?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This will be better than BvS, calling it now"
CmRih_VtVAs,Good shit! GOOD SHIT RIGHT HERE!!
CmRih_VtVAs,8th time watching this
CmRih_VtVAs,My fav superhero movie trailer tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,No Deathstroke? I cri...
CmRih_VtVAs,Where's the Bat?
CmRih_VtVAs,This + new Flash episode = ALL THE YUS!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:58 The Joker creating Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,The guy at 1:44 who could it be? He looks like the main villain judging by the ruined stuff in other shots
CmRih_VtVAs,"que TRAILER É ESSE..NOSSAAAAAAA!
parabéns!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Is this still real life?""

0 seconds into the trailer and it already states our reaction to this trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,"the mst annoying thing to me isn't the trailer itself (the trailer is great) the annoying thing is one of the trailers lied about the tone of the movie. this movie can't be both. 
And yes someone was inspired by guardians of the galaxy which is probably a good move for traditionally broody dc to pull from. You're a movie starring insane comic book characters enjoy it and move on form the Nolan trilogy."
CmRih_VtVAs,When is this coming out again? I NEED IT NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,YESSSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,bruh they threw queen in that its a must see now aside from bvs
CmRih_VtVAs,"When they showed wonder woman footage I literally screamed. When the song for the SS trailer started my fanboy mind felt the hype, hype that filled my veins as my eyes were treated to what can only be described as Absolute bliss"
CmRih_VtVAs,Too much yes to handle
CmRih_VtVAs,so much better than that deadpool crap
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF was that thing tearing the train apart as it went through him (or it)
CmRih_VtVAs,Jai Courtney is gonna steal the show. I can't wait.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys!
CmRih_VtVAs,Dang son. I just peed my pants.
CmRih_VtVAs,joker laying around a bunch of knives and guns laughing crazily....love it
CmRih_VtVAs,What the hell is that thing at 1:52?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can't wait, it looks dope, but i bet they will ruin the movie in one of the 2 next trailers, or at least an important part"
CmRih_VtVAs,"10% views thumbs up, 1% thumbs down."
CmRih_VtVAs,I predict this is going to be better than Batman vs Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,It's only been around 20 days and I think we have the best trailer for 2016!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfect song for the Trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Boomer is the best part of this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks badass, looks way better then that Batman VS Superman movie thing."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Damn, does that look good."
CmRih_VtVAs,why is will smith in this...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Rule #1, NEVER COMPARE MARVEL TO DC. Thank You. (Gonna cause some arguments, already seeing Guardians of the Galaxy in here SHEESH)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love the song selection, works in perfect contrast to the first trailer that was very serious."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I AM SCREAMING. I just wish their was more Diablo. It's already kinda obvious that he's gonna be killed off, but he's still pretty awesome."
CmRih_VtVAs,Ok this is a way way better trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Im sold take my money plz.
CmRih_VtVAs,Using the greatest band ever and getting your trailer hyped up even more is sneaky shit.... I like it (I'm looking at you too GTA5)
CmRih_VtVAs,Rip marvel 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,"FUCK. YES.✊🏼
Im excited to see Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn"
CmRih_VtVAs,And for all you haters who despise Jared Leto's look be comforted by this trailer and his many wardrobe changes. Also I feel like Jai Courtney may actually surprise us with Boomerang
CmRih_VtVAs,"By the trailer this should be renamed to ""Harley Quinn and friends""... I LOVE IT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is that at 1:44?
CmRih_VtVAs,me morì
CmRih_VtVAs,QUERO NA MINHA BOQUINHA!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Heath Ledger is rolling in his grave right now.
CmRih_VtVAs,If no luke skywalker then no watch. Period.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,"august really, I'm dying to see this movie!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Lex Luthor?
CmRih_VtVAs,●↓●
CmRih_VtVAs,Poison Ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Goddammit Queen
CmRih_VtVAs,I just wanna love you P.Y.T.
CmRih_VtVAs,Amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still not feeling Smith as Deadshot, but it's too late to complain about that and this was actually better than expected."
CmRih_VtVAs,(oﾟ▽ﾟ)oﾟ▽ﾟ)oﾟ▽ﾟ)o
CmRih_VtVAs,what a piece of shit come on
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't tell who that is at 1:44 - 1:45 and it's killing me
CmRih_VtVAs,Never really had any interest in this film but this was a great trailer. Maybe one too many punchline pauses tho.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this shit is getting crazy, i love dc comics!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This could single handedly ruin Marvel's whole career.
CmRih_VtVAs,https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/20/a6/fb/20a6fb501a72e9b2cd7aba2013bf4a5e.jpg
CmRih_VtVAs,Hahaha yes I'm actually excited to see what Jai Courtney does with Captain Boomerang.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Chuyito if you're reading this you're dead to me since you decided to go to class instead of watching this MAGNIFICENT trailer. Shit, get your priorities straight."
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith still is the only bad casting. He's just simply combining performances from Bad Boys and Hancock. Instead of bothering to try and do something with Deadshot he has never done before acting wise.
CmRih_VtVAs,so marvel has the almighty netflix and DC has....the CW lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,i hope this beats stupid annoying ass starwars ugh i hate starwars
CmRih_VtVAs,My fan boy heart is warmed up. *Coughs and adjusta tie* I mean! Why am I not in this film?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"If this is rated PG-13, which I suspect it will be, then I don't have very high hopes for it to deliver. The trailers have looked good but with a team of villains it needs to be R so they can actually develop them as villains. It would be different if they had been used elsewhere before, like how the Avengers had a bunch of heroes from separate films together. PG-13 restricts the action sequences and doesn't allow much blood or violence. That isn't touching on the language aspect of film ratings. Introducing 9 new characters in 1  2 hour film is hard enough, establishing that they're villains is much harder."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm probably too old to say this but, totes amazeballs"
CmRih_VtVAs,arlequina muito fofa :3
CmRih_VtVAs,i like how captain boomerang immediately starts punching the shit outta people
CmRih_VtVAs,Next trailer should have Don't Stop Me Now as another Queen song
CmRih_VtVAs,"NOW THATS MORE LIKE IT. 

but what the hell are they fighting"
CmRih_VtVAs,"now, surely dc>>>>>>>>>>........>>>>>>>marvel"
CmRih_VtVAs,Isn't that Ted Whittall who played Smallville's Rick Flagg in the beginning talking to the Waller character??
CmRih_VtVAs,"For once, can a superhero trailer not lead to a stupid ass Marvel vs DC discussion? Seriously now...do you guys nor understand that all comic book fans need to unite together, and be hyped for all these movies(except Batman V Superman...that might not be good, but I'm gonna watch it anyways)"
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone have any idea who that plant villain might be?
CmRih_VtVAs,Glad that DC is making this one fun :-D
CmRih_VtVAs,IM TOO EXCITED FOR THISSSSS
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys, it's what we do"" I'm crying. Harley Quinn is everything lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,margot is hilarious af. cara is so pretty
CmRih_VtVAs,"i saw star wars only once, i will see this 3 times."
CmRih_VtVAs,margot is hilarious af. cara is so pretty
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley ass 10/10 <3
CmRih_VtVAs,what the song???
CmRih_VtVAs,what the song???
CmRih_VtVAs,"Screw the fan wars. This is a fantastic time to be a comic book fan, because this looks AMAZING."
CmRih_VtVAs,HOL UP HOL UP
CmRih_VtVAs,Groot feat DC ? 1:44 ;D HAHAHAHAHA
CmRih_VtVAs,This>batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought I gonna watch it for Harley Queen. I gonna watch it for its everything!
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you all my toys ('~')
CmRih_VtVAs,"ummm, no.  Was mildly annoyed with what they appeared to do with some of the characters to start with but now seeing this...no thanks.  This convinced me, thank you, no thank you."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh My fucking God
I am an average Indian, just thinking about all kinds of money I will be spending this year... ON MOVIES :D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes! Yes! And fuck yes!
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone have any idea who that plant villain is?
CmRih_VtVAs,That was fucking awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm aboard the hype train for this, I loved it."
CmRih_VtVAs,looking forward to this. looks sick as hell!
CmRih_VtVAs,Dear Warner Brothers............. thnak you so fking much!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,mixed opinion. dialogue has me concerned. Could go either way.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:31 who is that
CmRih_VtVAs,"@1:42 it looks like his gun has a suppressor on it  but when he shoots it looks like it doesn't.
I could be wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,what song at 0:25 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, Jai Courtney actually looks good in this. 

What parallel universe did I just step into?"
CmRih_VtVAs,thank they didn't give the plot of the movie like batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Whoever said DC was so serious
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hate when people complain about ""bad cgi"". It's not done yet moron"
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn will gonna steal the scene 60% of the time in this movie. I guarantee it.
CmRih_VtVAs,YEAH!
CmRih_VtVAs,looks great. funny
CmRih_VtVAs,I am more excited for this movie than Batman v Superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,Joder esto es la polla tio
CmRih_VtVAs,"i love how the first trailer was trying to make this look all scary and stuff, but this one is hilarious. Example: 1:35."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thought to myself this morning, "" I wonder when the new trailer for suicide squad will be coming out...I cant wait!""
Soo happy"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This has to be one of the best trailers ever made. Edited perfectly to the music, it doesn't spoil anything, it looks fun and well made. A trailer like this instantly puts this in the number 1 spot of my most anticipated films of the year."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear Marvel,
      GG.
             From DC fan boy"
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM IN LOVE
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like David Ayer and the studio heads at WB took a ton of Coke and LSD, watched Guardians of the Galaxy while reading some Suicide Squad comics, and said to themselves after ""Hey, we can make something even crazier and more ridiculous than those chumps at Marvel.""

I'm in."
CmRih_VtVAs,they wanna be Guardians of the Galaxy so bad when in reality they're a carbon copy of Saints Row
CmRih_VtVAs,Not really feeling it
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,NOP.
CmRih_VtVAs,I had a huge smile that entire video.  Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys""



""I hope you like dildos ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"""
CmRih_VtVAs,BE STILL MY HEART BE STILL!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:36 classic aussie XD
CmRih_VtVAs,"The first trailer for this Movie, I thought okay I might check this out. This trailer told that I need to see this movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,The song is called Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen for those wondering
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jeremy Jahns, you better do a reaction video for this one!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn <3
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,KEEP CALM AND WAIT FOR JARED LETO TO NAIL THE JOKER! :3
CmRih_VtVAs,"Bohemian Rhapsody is going to have thousands of views from this video, and people commenting that Suicide Squad bright them there.... Lol"
CmRih_VtVAs,Not a huge DC fan but I'm actually pretty hyped for this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Can we have a single DC trailer with out the fans saying ""Uh oh, Marvel is gonna worry! Marvel is gonna lose?""

Guys, DC is awesome. Marvel is awesome. This trailer is awesome. Stop instigating fan-wars. It's getting old now."
CmRih_VtVAs,It's DC's bullet against Marvel's the Avengers. :)
CmRih_VtVAs,loved the trailer but it showed to much
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley sounds like Sofia Vergara.
CmRih_VtVAs,SO EXCITED I PEED
CmRih_VtVAs,"They described this as a ""live action Assault on Arkham""...can I get a HYPE!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm fucking excited!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Somebody pay them to hologram Heath Ledger into that shit
CmRih_VtVAs,8/10 needs Deathstroke
CmRih_VtVAs,Impressive.
CmRih_VtVAs,Cum. There's cum EVERYWHERE.
CmRih_VtVAs,This and Deadpool... THIS and Deadpool..... THIS AND DEADPOOL.... Will make 2016 fucking amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,need more of joker..
CmRih_VtVAs,the music is just fantastic
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Balls to wall! Awesome trailer. More psyched for this than Batman vs Superman, Civil War, and X-Men: Apocalypse"
CmRih_VtVAs,deberían ponerle subtitulos en español :'v
CmRih_VtVAs,I saw this trailer in my Arkham cell
CmRih_VtVAs,What a great trailer!!!  Hopefully the movie is as good!
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer brought my excitement for this movie to *whole. 'nother. level.*
CmRih_VtVAs,Whelp they made them all look like anti heroes in this......
CmRih_VtVAs,"I just hope Will Smith is playing DEADSHOT, and not just being Will Smith."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:51 Ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,I can see the Guardians of the Galaxy here. :(
CmRih_VtVAs,"holy shit

thats all i can say"
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Trailer Explains Everything, EVERYTHING!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I am now looking forward to this. Changed my mind W.B.
CmRih_VtVAs,"All though this is a very stunning trailer, to all of you people saying that Marvel is going to wrecked, you might wanna rethink that. There is nothing that DC can do over take marvels plans for movies in the next 4-5 years, and with Avengers: Infinity war part 1 and 2 , DC is basically dead, but don't get me wrong I still love DC."
CmRih_VtVAs,"are they bad guys ? im not sure, the trailer didnt specify"
CmRih_VtVAs,Woooooow this is going to suck
CmRih_VtVAs,"'were bad guys, it's what we do'"
CmRih_VtVAs,А попка у Харли ниче так.
CmRih_VtVAs,Gonna be movie of the year.
CmRih_VtVAs,lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE IT
CmRih_VtVAs,"O bom desse trailer foi que não revelaram quase nada do plot do filme, apenas apresentaram os personagens e mostraram mais ou menos como vai ser o tom do filme, além de dar umas breve sinopse.
APRENDA MARVEL, não precisa mostrar o filme inteiro no trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,that guy really looks just like tom hardy. And that girl really looks just like emma watson..
CmRih_VtVAs,"Harley's ""creation"" scene at 1:58! My god, I'm so hyped for this!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I guess most people here actually like her, but Harley looks pretty cringeworthy in this. Does not seem genuine at all."
CmRih_VtVAs,they beating deadshots(will smith's) ass
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's just the trailer. I know. But the only good thing of it is the song. Other than that, it looks a very shallow movie, entertaining but shallow nonetheless. I'm not comparing any Batman movie with it, I'm actually comparing it with Arkham Assault and I'd still go for Arkham Assault. Still hoping I'm wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Beautiful, Im done with Batman, take my money Suicide Squad"
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:29- Wallpaper material right there.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE AWESOME!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is too skinnyDC > Marvel > DC
CmRih_VtVAs,wow... insanely good!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,its best for marvel to quit now...i mean why even bother?
CmRih_VtVAs,So. A song was needed to convey the atmosphere of the movie. And DC chose Bohemian Rhapsody. Did they hire the people from GOTG?
CmRih_VtVAs,I loveee itttttttt
CmRih_VtVAs,SO. MANY. GOOSEBUMPS.
CmRih_VtVAs,annnnd now I'm on board with this.
CmRih_VtVAs,I excited until it said August
CmRih_VtVAs,I'M FUCKING TURNED ON BY A TRAILER. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ME
CmRih_VtVAs,Thnks God for the movies. THIS is gonna be HUGE.
CmRih_VtVAs,Grab all of the tissues.
CmRih_VtVAs,Groot ?
CmRih_VtVAs,holy fuck
CmRih_VtVAs,yasss bitch yassss
CmRih_VtVAs,this is beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,YES. BIG YES!😆
CmRih_VtVAs,"Fucking hyped for this! Finally, the first bit of Batman related material to get excited for since 2012...Except Arkham Knight..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Probably one of my favourite trailer ever. Well done.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker's not a part of the Suicide Squad right? Then how does he fit into this plot? Sorry, don't read Suicide Squad comics."
CmRih_VtVAs,That shot of the helicopter firing off the barrage of flares or smoke bombs or whatever it was at 1:39. Jesus.
CmRih_VtVAs,"OH LORD ! CAN`T WAIT TO SEE MY SWEET HARLEY IN ACTION, I JUST LOVE THAT CRAZY BITCH!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Aw, so good. If only August would come sooner"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was expecting Batman vs Superman to look better than this.
...I was wrong."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dunno. Margot Robbie just doesn't seem to fit Harley right.. 
The trailer looks awesome though... this and Deadpool are two I will likely see in Theatre."
CmRih_VtVAs,Sweeeeeet
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this looks amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,R.i.p Marvel 2012-2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Missing Freddie...
CmRih_VtVAs,Slow Clap.....Bravo DC.  I officially can't wait for this
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG that was awesome!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,people who actually dislikes this are so dumb
CmRih_VtVAs,The game has CHANGED! DCEU in full effect!
CmRih_VtVAs,I WANNA SEE THIS MOVIE TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait to watch Cara and Margot!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I wanna see this even more than Batman v Superman...
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't explain how hype I am right now
CmRih_VtVAs,Dope song choice for a trailer. Queen will never disappoint. Perfect!
CmRih_VtVAs,Movie thinks it can win me over by slapping the passable trailer over an epic Queen song? Movie is right.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared leto does a heath ledger with a similar face-to-face encounter. Guess this joker is not gonna be a unique one. 

And that laugh, heath does it better.
 
Anyways, can't wait!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Good job jared 1:23
CmRih_VtVAs,Delícia de Trailer cara !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Strangely,  Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody works great with this trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"CHUPA HATERS DO LETO!
Devem estar chorando agora kkkkkkkkkkk"
CmRih_VtVAs,A Locust from Gears of War in the movie Suicide Squad to great :D
CmRih_VtVAs,"I've already seen this like 20 times & I'm still fucking excited like the first time :,D"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody? You guys sure know how to make a trailer huh?
CmRih_VtVAs,can't wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,hermoso!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,that was the greatest trailer I've ever seen!  So pumped for this movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMFG  BEST TRAILER!
CmRih_VtVAs,"No me gusta el aspecto del joker pero, será una estupenda pelicula"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it bad that I want to see this over Batman Vs. Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOoOoOoOove Harley Quinn she is amazing🏈😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 best frame in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 tell me that I am not the only one who is excited about  that scene!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks great, i'm so hyped right now"
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone give Will an oscar for this
CmRih_VtVAs,Damn this is one amazing trailer... Is this the real life? Or is this just fantasy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is my savior
CmRih_VtVAs,AWESOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC's version of Guardians! lol
CmRih_VtVAs,This is my 10th time watching this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:29 is my reaction whenever I see a comment from a Nolan's fanboy who still can't move on.
CmRih_VtVAs,0:44 He forgot the guy who throws boomerangs...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly, between the two trailers can the haters tell me what they hate? That isn't a rhetorical question. 373 people voted this down and I'm honestly curious what, at this point, gives them cause for concern?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Now I have to wait for the Mr Sunday Movies trailer breakdown...
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara delevingne? models are now invading DC too.
CmRih_VtVAs,PREPARE YOUR ANUS MARVEL!
CmRih_VtVAs,pg-13 or rated r?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The last trailer of Batman v Superman just spoiled the whole movie :/

This looks great.
But why does it take over 6 months to finish it ?
the first trailer is 6 months old and the filming was finished than."
CmRih_VtVAs,rip deadpool T_T
CmRih_VtVAs,"-Trailer starts off with Bohemian Rhapsody

DC clearly knows how to make a great trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Looking good! and good choice of music :)
CmRih_VtVAs,"at 1:20 why do I feel like he's going to say ""I can't wait to show you my dick"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now, this trailer sold me. It's a movie that knows it's a bit silly and doesn't look like it will take itself too seriously."
CmRih_VtVAs,guardianes de la galaxia?
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes. Can't wait!
CmRih_VtVAs,Someone call 911 I'm on my 20th orgasm in the last 2 minutes and 31 seconds.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks pretty fun, but I doubt it will be a quality film."
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so early :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Assault on Arkham did it better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"No Batman , no fun."
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is wifey material……End of Story!
CmRih_VtVAs,I was excited when i saw it releases in August...then i remembered it's 2016 and i'm only in January ._.
CmRih_VtVAs,In just one scene of this trailer Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn has stolen my heart. She's goin to kill it in this movie. Can't wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,So much yes.
CmRih_VtVAs,best trailer eveeeeeer!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,It's time to get...... SUICIDAL
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 The Orb?! Ghost rider confirmed? What?! D:?
CmRih_VtVAs,everyone calling that plant thing groot could be poison ivy ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"WAIT !

CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!
CmRih_VtVAs,The only two things this has in common with GotG is that it has a team of misfits and it looks kick ass.
CmRih_VtVAs,I like DC and Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,Well that was pretty disappointing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who ever disliked this video I'm mad at you😡😡😡
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks dumb AF, still gonna illegally download it."
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh... Dear... God... I need this now
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't know shit about suicide squad, looks sweet, are they fighting the Joker? And is this rated R?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Sadly, there seems to be no Deathstroke. This still looks awesome though"
CmRih_VtVAs,sweet jesus im excited for this more than any other movies in 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,So is that joker jumping into a vat of chemicals and coming up with a  manikin
CmRih_VtVAs,this shit isnt even worth stealing
CmRih_VtVAs,"Song was:   Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody. 

I know someone's gonna ask for the song XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait- so harley's origin was that she was pushed into acid? idk how i feel about that
CmRih_VtVAs,1:19 when you made a new friend in pre-school and they finally come over to play
CmRih_VtVAs,and now another movie i can't see until it released... WHY!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks at least 10 times better than BvS.

Never in my life I thought I would say a Suicide Squad movie would look better than a movie with fucking Batman and Superman."
CmRih_VtVAs,RIP to the play button because I'm sure I am going to press it to death lol
CmRih_VtVAs,It was good....until I saw Joker. The Joker looks like fucking shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody... This is gonna be EPIC!!!!!

CmRih_VtVAs,WILL SMITH IS COOL AGAIN!
CmRih_VtVAs,shit get reeeally good at 1:38
CmRih_VtVAs,More pumped for Batman v Superman than this
CmRih_VtVAs,Better trailer than Batman v. Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,marvel's trailer looks shitty after this
CmRih_VtVAs,And Batman?? Where is Batman?? XD
CmRih_VtVAs,Didn't dc say there wont be humor in there movies?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit!!! HERMOSO, MARAVILLOSO!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think the ""villain"" in this movie might be poison ivy... I might be wrong"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why even bother with BVS?? more like why even bother with any Marvel movie anymore.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Best.  Trailer.  Ever.

CmRih_VtVAs,"I haven't seen a super hero movie since forever ago, but this has me hyped af."
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is like the orgasm year for films I swear.
CmRih_VtVAs,meme trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"heart skipped a beat a few times, so yeah fucking awesome trailer!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm dying cause Rick Flagg sounds so black at the end lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Omfg... Pause at 1:59 ... That shot.. Literally flawless.
If you haven't read the Suicide Squad comics, just to let you know Joker shoves Harleen into a tank full of liquid that makes her go crazy and fall in love with her, transforming her into Harley Quinn of course! So happy they added that scene in!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, if DC and WB is getting anything right, it's the marketing for Suicide Squad. The trailers are both awesome, along with the posters. 

Leto seems to have nailed it and very surprisingly, Jai Courtney appears to be killing it. Like dude has a chance of stealing the film it seems. Didn't expect that at all. Kudos to him. 

On a bit negative side, Margot Robbie and Will Smith don't do much for me here. Hopefully, that'll be different in the film itself. And it's still a shame Hardy couldn't be Rick Flagg - he would fit here extremely well."
CmRih_VtVAs,"white face racist.


Anyway, nobody asked for this. God what awful"
CmRih_VtVAs,thats how you make a trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,THANK U DC THANK U FOR EVERYTHING !
CmRih_VtVAs,"""Sorry, it's the voices. I'm kidding! It's not what they really said."""
CmRih_VtVAs,Not a dc heroe's fan but i am a dc villans fan
CmRih_VtVAs,MARVEL IS ON SUICIDE WATCH
CmRih_VtVAs,Who wins in the DC/MARVEL war? The fans! We're getting the best of BOTH worlds!
CmRih_VtVAs,If Will Smith doesn't get an Oscar for his Jada will be pissed.
CmRih_VtVAs,Leto proving the haters wrong
CmRih_VtVAs,"0:55 ""Sorry, the voices."" Hahahaha"
CmRih_VtVAs,BvS just got shit on in one trailer. Can't wait for this
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck you marvel!!
CmRih_VtVAs,badass
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm lost for words. Amazing!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is no one going to talk about the new villain at 1:44 and 1:52 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cant believe what I 'm saying, but Jai Courtney is a scene sealer in this one. Along with Harley."
CmRih_VtVAs,omg bohemian rhapsody omg
CmRih_VtVAs,Thanks for showing us all the good scenes in the movie!
CmRih_VtVAs,Name of the song at the end?
CmRih_VtVAs,My heart just exploded after watching Harley Quin!

CmRih_VtVAs,"I really recommend the animated version of this, it's fucking amazing!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes. Yes? No. Yes. Yes! OH this is craziness.
CmRih_VtVAs,Devin Faraci and Nick Mundy disliked this
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks awesome but they need to really give a good enough explanation as to why they're sending villains, instead of heroes, to go do the job. Also, they would have to give a good reason why the villains are even accepting the mission..."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Man... This is gonna be awesome! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah <3
CmRih_VtVAs,So good!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,batman vs superman and then this?what will happen when wonder woman and flash comes out ? dc is killing it as well as  marvel this is the best time to be a fan of superhero movies

CmRih_VtVAs,"omg! leto in minute 1:23 scares me, I totally like it !"
CmRih_VtVAs,AAAAH QUE DELÍCIA CARA
CmRih_VtVAs,"Here is the way I see it: I grew up in the 1990s. We had a handful of Batman movies, Superman movies (2 watchable), and terrible movies like Spawn and Steel. I welcome all these comic book movies, DC, Marvel or third party (Hellboy, etc) as long as THEY ARE GOOD. I am excited to have a variety. of comic book movies and it excites me."
CmRih_VtVAs,Guardians of the Galaxy wannabe
CmRih_VtVAs,"okay whats with all the ""this looks way better than BvS"" coments? Just because the last trailer was as good as previous ones? I think they will both be amazing. Plus BvS is more important"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like it will be better than BvS...
CmRih_VtVAs,"""She's just crazy"" :)0"

CmRih_VtVAs,My heart can barely handle this amount of energetic and adrenaline pumping visual mayhem in a limited time frame.This is going to be so Rock N' Roll. HELL YES!
CmRih_VtVAs,Needs more Batman...
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the villain at 1:52? Is the same thing that stops the train and destroys it. My God they are going to show when the Joker puts Harley in the acid bath.
CmRih_VtVAs,que coisa maravilhosa
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie looks awesome. Hope the movie is as good as there hyping it to be.
CmRih_VtVAs,Did the Joker just jump in acid?
CmRih_VtVAs,DC>Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Was that Jai Courtney being likable? TELL ME THAT WAS JAI COURTNEY BEING ACTUALLY LIKABLE.
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker looks like Macauly Culkin
CmRih_VtVAs,It has the feel of the animated movie which is a very good sign. Will looks badass.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm feeling this trailer!

CmRih_VtVAs,"I never thought I'd say this....but jai courtney looks great in this, in fact the whole cast looks spot on"
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 holy shit is that Scott Eastwood?? He really looks a lot like his dad in The Good The Bad and The Ugly days.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Still think the Joker looks like shit, but the rest looks impresive."
CmRih_VtVAs,Aahhh my new heroesss :))
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm soooooo happy that Harley Quinn is going to be in a movie. I have been waiting for Harley Quinn or Harley/Joker in live action form.
CmRih_VtVAs,theatre people are going to have a tough time when everybody is going to poop their pants...freaking awesome

CmRih_VtVAs,"My god, that's alex ross' joker 1:23"
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody instantly makes this the greatest trailer of all time

CmRih_VtVAs,I'm crying.
CmRih_VtVAs,"why do the villains always have it better. The colors, font, music. Being a villain is just so much more badass"

CmRih_VtVAs,The best part is Captain Boomerang cracking a beer.
CmRih_VtVAs,DC I love u
CmRih_VtVAs,Too much bad CGI. But it still looks like a great movie. But I'm gonna hate Harley Quinn. I just know it.
CmRih_VtVAs,I knew Jarred Leto would be good from the start. You ledger dick riders can suck my nuts. (No disrespect to Ledger he was fantastic as well)
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else watch this like 50 times already?!?!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG they just showed the whole movie!... I'm kidding
CmRih_VtVAs,"I dont know, the music didnt match with the situation at all"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh my god! Jay Courtney looks like he's acting! This movie may not only bring thousands of people into the comic book fandom, but it will also do miracles and create actors."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who does Cara Delvine play?
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sick of the whole DC vs MARVEL debate get over it enjoy them both don't be an opinionated fanboy #DC&MARVEL

What is up with the bad lines for the joker? "" I cant wait for you to play with my toys!"", what a downgrade from heath ledger. Christ i really hope this movie is good but it doesnt look like it"
CmRih_VtVAs,"ive never been sure about margott robbie and i still am not, but for sure i think jared leto wont be good, and its not because of jared but because of the design they have given this joker, it looks more like a fan of the joker than the joker itself. also cara?"

CmRih_VtVAs,This is legitimately terrible. The movie looks great but this trailer is just so fucking bad.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks sooo good jesus
CmRih_VtVAs,I hope this movie is rated R because I'm sick of PG-13 comic book movies
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG YAAASSSS !!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,That was F'in Amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,GG editor
CmRih_VtVAs,I shed tears watching this. Fuck me up man.
CmRih_VtVAs,at 1:52 is that poison ivy?
CmRih_VtVAs,"AWW HELL YES
So pumped, can't wait to see it!
Can we just skip BatmanVSuperman and watch this earlier instead?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man, just a big ol' chocolate box full of good looking stuff this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,YESSSSS BRUUHHHH!
CmRih_VtVAs,another crap video game/movie ...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hey Marvel, suck on this"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jack Nicholson did a better Joker than Jared Leto and Heath Ledger together.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay. Whoever directed this trailer needs a rise. Because I thought Suicide Squad looked shit, but this trailer made me really freaking hyped for it. Holy shit."
CmRih_VtVAs,Is Enchantress at the White House at 1:27?
CmRih_VtVAs,BvS is a joke compared to this
CmRih_VtVAs,Somebody make me a GIF 2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,Love the portrayal of the Joker and Harley Quinn. Bohemian Rhapsody also makes this much more fantastic. Literally the best movie trailer I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,"i'm a mad marvel fan but shit, this is fucking great."
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy SHIT. I think I'm officially more excited for Suicide Squad than I am for Batman v Superman.
CmRih_VtVAs,"the tone seems way different than the last trailer but I just love everything I see from this movie.the special effects look great. Harley, Enchantress, Croc and Katana look good!!! Jai Courtney, Scott Eastwood and Rick Flag look sexy as fuck!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck... Best trailer ever!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Buenisima !! Me encanto !! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,fukk batman vs superman I'm all about suicide squad and captain america civil war woooo!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,At 1:44 that thing destroying the train... I think that's joker because at 1:59 he's wearing the same kind of thing what the train destroyer was wearing but idk... Theory
CmRih_VtVAs,KRLH QUE TRAILER FOI ESSE ???? UUUUUHHHHUUUU !!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The only thing I don't like so far is the fact that they're going with the storyline where Harley was dipped in the evil chemicals that turned her crazy. I prefer the storyline where she goes crazy simply by the joker's influence.
CmRih_VtVAs,"A lot of very interesting and unusual visual elements going on here with the effects, lots of cool stuff we haven't seen in other movies...  look forward to it.  wonder what it would have been like with Tom Hardy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto looks crazy good
CmRih_VtVAs,Like im the only one who paused at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my TOYS!""
Now I'm listening."
CmRih_VtVAs,pqp ta foda de mais
CmRih_VtVAs,"My only concern is that there's gonna be one more trailer left. So far suicide squad is 2/2 on trailers, I hope the wont mess it up."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I would see it if Harley Quinn was ignorable. And she's not. That line ""Sorry, the voices""? Uuughgh. Cringeworthy acting, cringeworthy writing. Why can no one get that character right? Are the 90's cartoons the only ones who can write that character well?"
CmRih_VtVAs,this film will be the pica of the galaxys
CmRih_VtVAs,so it's civil war vs b vs s vs suicide squad
CmRih_VtVAs,"All right I'm gonna go on a limb a say, the main villain is Joker who some how gains enchantress powers.  Don’t take this as just a random theory. Unless it turns out to be true then remember I said it first."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Joker jumping into the pit of chemicals to rescue Harley (presumably after he pushed her in) 

I CANT FUCKING WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE!! 
Let's go DC bring my childhood to life I love it !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes...just yes
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm liking the light hearted take. If there's one thing DC needs, it's to lighten the FUCK up."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love queen, but god I'm so sick of that song...."
CmRih_VtVAs,oscar for margo robie pls
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit, any trailer that starts with Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is obviously a great trailer. Holy shit, I had to edit my comment because I just noticed that Holden from ""The Killing"" is in this too."
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is that at 1:44?
CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer EVER!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,What's the name of the song that plays?
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks sooo much better than BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,never get sick of this I have watched it like 1 000 000
CmRih_VtVAs,the chills
CmRih_VtVAs,Thanks DC! Margot Robbie looks awesome in 2:06
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is batman?
CmRih_VtVAs,Let Ben Affleck and Henry Fight while We Cheer on these guys and boo Batman and Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Why isn't Margot doing the Harley Quinn voice?? Deal breaker for me
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm gonna be broke this summer from all these superhero movies coming out geez. lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"!!!Holy crap Holy crap Holy crap Holy crap Holy crap Holy crap Holy crap!!!
Why can't I just take a nap until August, so I can watch BvS and this back-to-back?! Does anybody have an app for that?
Seriously though. I am way more excited for this than BvS.
Holy crap!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,What is that thin in the subway shot? It's Joker colours
CmRih_VtVAs,It's called Suicide Squad because it makes me want to suicide myself out of pure cringe.
CmRih_VtVAs,Now kids don't go fighting till August
CmRih_VtVAs,1:43 Did groot just join the suicide squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,More excited for this than Batman vs Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,HERMOSO *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,"=Al Youtuber Andres Navy no le gustará este trailer por que tiene música de Queen y no de Justin Bieber o esos artistas popsitos!...

No se crean!

CmRih_VtVAs,Ovaries just exploded. Shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,Fake and gay
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how everyone is saying Marvel is dead now, like they were saying DC was dead with the Civil War trailer. When a new Civil War trailer comes out, people will be saying DC is dead. Then another new DC trailer will come out and people will say Marvel is dead. smh"
CmRih_VtVAs,Isn't that witch a Victoria Secret's model?
CmRih_VtVAs,love it. im crying
CmRih_VtVAs,I just loved the use of the song
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm not sure whether this movie takes it self seriously or if it's going to be a Dark Knight-esque gritty theme.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm actually more pumped up for this one than Dawn of Justice. :) #SuicideSquad
CmRih_VtVAs,WORST SONG FOR A VIGILANTE TRAILER!
CmRih_VtVAs,I will write in my language: PUTA QUE O PARIU SÓ EM AGOSTO?????????
CmRih_VtVAs,Did anyone else pause at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Take my fucking money! So many superhero movies this year.
CmRih_VtVAs,This... Is just so perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who or what the hell is that in 1:43?
CmRih_VtVAs,meh...
CmRih_VtVAs,DC YOU JUST KILLED IT... FUCKIN AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,mostly dc films are better than marvel films
CmRih_VtVAs,DOPE! Can't wait to see it!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more excited for 'Suicide Squad' than 'Batman Vs. Superman'.
CmRih_VtVAs,looking alot better than batman vs superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"Reunión en los HQ de la warner bross en la que discuten acerca del nuevo trailer de suicide squad
C.O. -Cómo podemos hacer que el trailer sea más épico que cualquier otro visto previamente?
Director creativo -Pongamos a Queen como banda sonora

CmRih_VtVAs,Epico
CmRih_VtVAs,"EVERY ONE IS HYPED ABOUT LETO AND THEY SHOULD BE BUT I WILL TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE MARGOT ROBBIE FOR AMAZING PERFORMANCE , SUCH PSYCHED SUCH AMAZE MUCH WOW .. i was screaming haven't i :/"
CmRih_VtVAs,👎🏼👎🏼
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now this is a superhero movie! I'm sorry but I have little to no anticipation for BvS, but, I do feel like they are sending us for a loop with the promotional stuff and there some stuff that'll happen in the film we aren't expecting. But wow honestly this is my most anticipated movie in this genre."
CmRih_VtVAs,I love you Harley Quinn!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Why do I have a feeling this movie is still going to rock?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Só eu prefiro a Arlequina e o Coringa de antes ?
Achei muito tosco os ""atuais"" !"
CmRih_VtVAs,My gawd The hype overload!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing sound track
CmRih_VtVAs,this trailer is so much better then the one w/ the song called i started a joke
CmRih_VtVAs,DOES THIS TRAILER HAVE SPOILERS OR NOTTTTT ?!?!?!?! Please answer
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 Groot?
CmRih_VtVAs,if Will Smith doesn't win an oscar will his crazy ugly bad actress of a wife cry about it?

CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith baby! He's going to rock this one!
CmRih_VtVAs,"ok now i should make a joke

CmRih_VtVAs,Best trailer i have ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,I have a feeling that this is gonna have an awesome soundtrack just like guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,omg ew atleast tell us who theyre going up against
CmRih_VtVAs,wow...
CmRih_VtVAs,It's LIT!
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my god!! I cannot wait to see it!! That looks hilarious! 😀😀👏🏻👏🏻
CmRih_VtVAs,"We have to wait till August to see the best Super Villain, I mean hero movie ever!?!?!?"
CmRih_VtVAs,looks just ok. like one long set piece. filmed on one street one location. i do think harley will steal the show.
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE
CmRih_VtVAs,anyone know how to build a time machine so I can watch the movie already?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Who is it at the 1:44 and again at 1:52? anyone? You can see this person splitting the train in half, who could it be?"
CmRih_VtVAs,0:45 Cara with rick flagg
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm ready. I've always had faith in Jared Leto as The Joker and this just strengthens it :)
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here for the Bohemian Rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,ITS ABOUT TIMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
CmRih_VtVAs,"They're like if the Guardians Of the Galaxy did Meth, and lived in trailer parks, and had syphilis, but instead of a Racoon they have a fucking Crocodile. 
A fucking Crocodile."
CmRih_VtVAs,Huh.  I think I might almost be buying in to this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,yasssssss
CmRih_VtVAs,Billion times silly and pointless
CmRih_VtVAs,"Why do people hate on MArvel after one trailer or opposite way around? You guys sound stupid as fuck. Marvel and DC are fucking sick and if youre a comic fan then you appreciate both companies producing movies based on comic you know and love. You know you will see all the DC movies and Marvel on release, dont lie"
CmRih_VtVAs,"every new trailer, a new shot"
CmRih_VtVAs,My heart can't handle this!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Its a shame they've cut the song track. They should 've only mess with the volume. I bet you the trailer looks cooler with the original version on it.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm confused, is this going to be DC's fun movie? That being said this looks bloody incredible, definitely a leap in the right direction"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just came
CmRih_VtVAs,simplify awesome!!! I love it!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Me and my friends .. so realistic
CmRih_VtVAs,I love you Margot !! muuuahh
CmRih_VtVAs,Great
CmRih_VtVAs,"so many A-list actors its a AAA forced movie but better than BvS crap chris nolan might be laughting his ass off in his mansion
jared leto its a JOKE literally speaking ,will smith well its will smith ,, joel kinnaman best of the movie 
and that skank its overrated. PERIOD heath come back to life pleaseeee this hollywood assholes ruins everything"
CmRih_VtVAs,okay way better than the teaser. I approve.
CmRih_VtVAs,nah. looks gay
CmRih_VtVAs,"could this be 2016's ""guardians of the galaxy"" a film inspired by a less famous comic book set up than your average spiderman, captain america fair that monsters the box office ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,100000000000000% better than the Batman vs Superman trailer. And Harley is absolute gold.
CmRih_VtVAs,*I. CANT. EVEN.... dies*
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:05
Just waiting the gifs"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just realized Harley's reading Twilight..
CmRih_VtVAs,Way better than Batman vs Superman trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"that guitar solo.. 

yes"
CmRih_VtVAs,I came for this.
CmRih_VtVAs,Marveldrones on Suicide Watch!
CmRih_VtVAs,now excited for August
CmRih_VtVAs,Who cares about which comic book company is better? Let's just be excited about all the comic book movies coming out this year! I'm excited for every single one :D
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is Deadpool?
CmRih_VtVAs,Well it's not gonna be as serious of a movie as I thought it would be from the other trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley is adorable and creepy at the same time. I love it!
CmRih_VtVAs,Here's me betting this movie's whole soundtrack in 70's rock music.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Okay, still not on the hype for Jared Leto's Joker because I still don't feel like he is Joker. Other than that though, this looks really good and pretty much the only live action DC film I'm looking forward to."
CmRih_VtVAs,favorite shot 1:29
CmRih_VtVAs,"My most anticipated movie this year... I can't wait to see #KillerCroc in action, been aching for years to see Croc done properly for the silver screen... The Joker and the rest of the Squad look amazing as well."
CmRih_VtVAs,"lol all the Marvel/DC fanboys picking sides probably have never picked up a comic in their life. Enjoy both or stfu. When you come into the comments saying ""R.I.P Marvel"" or ""R.I.P D.C"" you look like an idiot. we all know D.C fanboys were in the theater enjoying Avengers and Marvel Fanboys will be there day 1 seeing Batman v Superman. Not everything is a fucking war"
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel bitch
CmRih_VtVAs,who is the bad guy?
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow I forgot Batman is even in here. Holy Shit. That's how you do a trailer. Mindblown.
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so awesome. Just awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh sure, anything looks cool with Bohemian Rhapsody playing.

Ehhh, I'm still not quite sold on this, but it still looks better than BvS does, so it's got that going for it."
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like crying.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who is the girl in the blue at 1:53? Character and actor?
CmRih_VtVAs,"A maioria só achou a Margot gostosa, e a atuaçao? só ficou parecida pq atuar sorry..."
CmRih_VtVAs,that was fucking good
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my god this is amazing. Hell yeah DC!!
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 :)
CmRih_VtVAs,hahahahahahaa
CmRih_VtVAs,Cara Delevingne <3333333333333333333333
CmRih_VtVAs,"Man David Ayer looks like he nailed the squad! Margot Robbie...wait I don't see her. All I see is Harley Quinn. Whoever even first thought about casting her deserves a huge pay day along with Robbie herself. I had my thoughts about Jared Leto as the Joker, but after seeing this trailer those thoughts are pretty much leaving. Can't wait to see this!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Satisfecho
CmRih_VtVAs,Sold.  I'm in.
CmRih_VtVAs,This Music Video Tho 🔥 (No but seriously this trailer was well done)
CmRih_VtVAs,Queen made this trailer badass! movie looks good....but Jared Leto as joker just don't work
CmRih_VtVAs,Since when does Harley not have an accent? Margot Robbie even has the same accent and yet fails to use it to be her character... STILL AWESOME
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass <3
CmRih_VtVAs,"EVEN MORE EXCITED! This trailer had that fun, crazy, ridiculous vibe Suicide Squad has! This will definitely be one of my favorite films!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,How can people dislike this
CmRih_VtVAs,2:11 Robbie drops her accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh hell fucking yeah
CmRih_VtVAs,Can this movie come out in March instead of BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer was beautiful and so was joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Don't worry if Batman v Super sucks DC got this up its sleeve
CmRih_VtVAs,LOVE IT.
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST TRAILER EVEEEEERR!
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait to show you my toys 🙃🔪⛓⚒🔩
CmRih_VtVAs,I NEED AGOUST RIGHT NOW
CmRih_VtVAs,"As a Marvel fan, I'm officially scared shitless..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm loving Harley Quinn by the way. Still not feeling Joker, but a bit more optimistic after that ""I can't wait to show you my toys"" scene."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Feel so Guardians Of The Galaxy, But are know, see incredible"
CmRih_VtVAs,i thought this was going to be dark....
CmRih_VtVAs,This and deadpool
CmRih_VtVAs,98% of the trailer is new footage and doesn't spoil a thing! I just hope that they didn't show us all of the humor.
CmRih_VtVAs,Like the first trailer more! Yay for Queen!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,Great trailer and great Queens music video
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks so awesome... I just kinda wish Harley Quinn had her Brooklyn accent ""Oh Mista J!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,this will seriously be such a great movie. DC just needs to take themselves a bit less seriously and they'll do way better as far as reviews and box office numbers go. definitely going opening night to see SS!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dammit marvel fans seriously stayed up, waited for this trailer to drop, took the time to find this trailer, just to say that Captain America: Civil war's trailer is better then this one.
 Hold the L please"
CmRih_VtVAs,IM BATTTMAN !
CmRih_VtVAs,Se ve que van hacer mucha plata
CmRih_VtVAs,NOT WATCHING THIS MOVIE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A SIN
CmRih_VtVAs,MY FUCKING BODY IS READY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm sort of getting an Enzo Amore vibe from Jai Courtney... I like it alot.
CmRih_VtVAs,no badass moment??? WTF!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks like it's going to be way better than I thought it was going to be. But I'm still a little confused about The Joker. He looks a little young, shouldn't he still be a normal person at the time that he's the age he appears to be?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Minuto 1:55?
CmRih_VtVAs,hey everyone its a trailer that doesn't reveal the entire plot of the movie l actually might go see it now since i don't already know the entire story  before it comes out
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wait, so is this supposed to be a fun movie? Or a dark movie? I'm very conflicted. But intrigued"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I cant wait to show you my toys"" Damn."
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally. Every teaser or release to date has given me zero motivation to see this movie. This is great.
CmRih_VtVAs,Wasn't sure about this movie. And then I saw this trailer. And I haven't been able to stop smiling since. This is one of the best trailers I've seen in years. Up there with Force Awakens and Watchmen.
CmRih_VtVAs,vim por calsa do terror e do castanhari
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT CAN'T WAIT
CmRih_VtVAs,is Batman in this movie ??
CmRih_VtVAs,I love it.
CmRih_VtVAs,what are the names of the songs?
CmRih_VtVAs,"bvs is gonna suck this is gonna rock, calling it now"
CmRih_VtVAs,Fuck yeah!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hoooly shiit, I can't wait to show you my Tooooys !!! maaaaaaahhh god"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker was the best part.
CmRih_VtVAs,Kreygasm
CmRih_VtVAs,ÉOQ ?!
CmRih_VtVAs,wow this was a major improvement from the previous trailer. Now I'm actually excited for a DCCU movie
CmRih_VtVAs,2:10 somebody is defusing the bomb
CmRih_VtVAs,"'DC is so boring and serious, there are no jokes in their movies'"
CmRih_VtVAs,this is beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,after of the last batman movie--- I think this is another good reason to see action hero (anti) movie again--  Batman vs superman looks great but this movie really   go awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,don't forget batman will.make an appearance in the movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY AHHHHH THIS LOOKS SO BLOODY GOOD.
CmRih_VtVAs,SHARINGAN! 1:38
CmRih_VtVAs,Hope the movie is as good as this trailer.

CmRih_VtVAs,"There's really nothing not to like about this trailer. Jai Courtney as Boomerang though. That guy might be stealing some scenes in this one, folks. He was really funny."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC wants to be marvel so bad 😂😂

CmRih_VtVAs,JOKER LOOKS GREAT
CmRih_VtVAs,"Now, this is how you sell a movie. Still, not sure if this movie is going to be good."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This will be the Guardians of The Galaxy but for DC, cant wait for this. Looks better than Dawn Of Justice already."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Guardians of the Galaxy much? But hey I'm not complaining. Looks dope. I think the only thing I don't like about Jokers look is his teeth. But ya, looks like a fun movie﻿

Edit: I'm saying the trailers are similar. I realize the teams, characters, and story are very different. Holy shit. Calm down guys. I said I was excited, not talking shit. ﻿"

CmRih_VtVAs,why does it feel that Harley Quinn feels a bit forced her?
CmRih_VtVAs,Doesn't look too interesting.  I'll probably give it a pass.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, this looks far better than I was expecting and I was planing on seeing it regardless :o Cannot wait!"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is not about a war. This about facts. This is the best comic book trailer of the last few years. FACT.
CmRih_VtVAs,"just wow ,"

CmRih_VtVAs,All this trailer did was get my excited for a Queen biopic.
CmRih_VtVAs,"From the first second, when I heard bohemian rhapsody began, I immediately and continuously said,""yep yep yep yep yep"" throughout the whole trailer. Great trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"I get a little of Devils Rejects vibe, in the sense of evil-duers having fun and being funny. I like It!"

CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to give Deadpool an orgasm induced coma. It's that good.
CmRih_VtVAs,Waiting for this every single minute! I love this new trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,The more I see of Leto as the Joker the more I think he's gonna kill it. That laugh alone has me more hyped.
CmRih_VtVAs,"This Trailer is fuckin badass!! Anybody else think at 1:44 that creature like thing, looks a lot like Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"not 1 hour yet, the viewers already 300.000, awesome fans"
CmRih_VtVAs,Dat ass....

CmRih_VtVAs,Now I'm convinced: This movie is going to be terrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,la rubia margot haha
CmRih_VtVAs,I have no words for how amazingly phenomenal this trailer is
CmRih_VtVAs,DAMNNNNNNNNN
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot is going to steal this fucking movie.... I'm in love
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfection.
CmRih_VtVAs,CADE OS BR ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"If I weren't already sold, this would have me on board completely. But I've been excited for so long already, this just made me more excited."
CmRih_VtVAs,está parecendo ser bom o negócio :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally a trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"If no more trailers for this film come out, I would still be so fucking satisfied"
CmRih_VtVAs,10/11 would watch this
CmRih_VtVAs,This is in the running with BvS Comic-con trailer for best trailer I've seen in a while. The wonder woman footage looks fucking epic too.
CmRih_VtVAs,Dear God this is beautiful!
CmRih_VtVAs,well this is nothing like the first trailer...BUT I LOVE IT!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,alguém do brasil aqui ? ahushausuas U_U
CmRih_VtVAs,"Alright... but can someone please explain:  WTF is Those things that they're fighting against? like a black goo, i don't know"
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you had told me the trailer for Suicide Squad would've made me 10x more hyped for the film than the trailer for BvS did for it's own respective property, I would've laughed in your face.

But holy fuck does Suicide Squad's marketing team know how to make a trailer. They're showing just enough of the plot and characters to let us know what we're in for, without spoiling the whole fucking plot. Queen is just the cherry on top of this sweet sweet sundae."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I gotta say I am so so so proud to be a fan, I've waited so long for this trailer and i am so satisfied and pumped for the movie. Thank you David Ayer, thank you Margot Robbie, thank you Viola Davis and Jared Leto. I'm sleeping good tonight."
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel is probably a little nervous
CmRih_VtVAs,impressive! specially the beginning song
CmRih_VtVAs,im gonna watch this over and over while I install GTA 5 on my PS3...
CmRih_VtVAs,well done dc
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit... What the fuck did I just watch
CmRih_VtVAs,Now *THAT* is a trailer!
CmRih_VtVAs,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
CmRih_VtVAs,ok could 150 seconds of footage excellently paced and perfectly edited set to an inspired music choice make me take back everything I have said about the potential of success for DC's suicide squad. This looks insane ( in a good way)
CmRih_VtVAs,Just take my money already.
CmRih_VtVAs,That Queen mix is amazing!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm more excited for this than BvS probably, is that wrong?"
CmRih_VtVAs,what the F**K????????????? what kind of trailer is this? and look suicide squad is like one of my favorite teams in comics period and I just loved the previous trailer for its dark and gritty tone which is what should fit this movie but seriously? this trailer along with the backround music just made it appear more crappy comedy than it should really be
CmRih_VtVAs,dc and wb r bringing it
CmRih_VtVAs,Perfección 😍❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,FKN FANTASTIC
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks horrible.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Did you know it's illegal to like both Marvel and DC? I didn't think so, but the comments tell me otherwise."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks better than Batman v. Superman, honestly."
CmRih_VtVAs,First one was super serious. Still was super good. The one showed the comedy in the movie. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT
CmRih_VtVAs,AMAZING!!
CmRih_VtVAs,The movie looks really fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,Space Cop looks better.
CmRih_VtVAs,"If you change the music to Guardian of the Galaxy's theme music , it'll be funny as fk"
CmRih_VtVAs,Well if this and Deadpool turn out to be amazing I will be so satisfied.
CmRih_VtVAs,"""El Diablo is useless"".. Okay.... But seriously if that isn't agent Grayson I'll be shocked.. Can't remember the actors name"
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh! Hell yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,if this movie didnt look awesome enough they put queen in trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,CHUPEM MEU CU
CmRih_VtVAs,"Marvel vs DC, who gives a shit. I'm just going to watch the hell out of this movie."
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,"Shouldn't this be called ""Trailer 2?"""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Take my money, and thats all there is to it. #Skwad"
CmRih_VtVAs,I just had a moment in my pants.
CmRih_VtVAs,JOKER LOOKS LIKE A FAT BABY BUT THIS TRAILER IS PRETTY AWESOME AND THE MOVIE LOOKS COOL AND JUST PURE FUN. Seriously those people that show up to these comic book movie trailers searching for enlightenment or whatever the fuck are missing the POINT. Does the plot look interesting? Is the dialogue believable? Has the stick been removed from your ass? If yes to all these questions then CONGRATS AND ENJOY COOL EXPLOSIONS SET TO QUEEN.
CmRih_VtVAs,Seriously how do you go from training day to this?!
CmRih_VtVAs,"CRAPPY trailer, go watch the TOTALLY superior Star Trek 2016 trailer, cause it's TOTALLY BETTER, everyone agrees.




waits for someone to take my sarcasm seriously, lol."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I'm touching myself tonight..."""
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks amazing, Margot is perfect (i like that didn't do a Tara Strong and try to copy the classic voice) and my god it looks insane. I'm so excited for this and happy, really love it when a trailer clicks like this."
CmRih_VtVAs,Music suited it perfectly and the syncing in with the gun sounds made it even more beautiful
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie will be more epic than BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, I'd watch that"
CmRih_VtVAs,"i just peed a little, anyone else ?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I feel like people are going to complain that its too much like Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't give a damn about the DC versus marvel bullshit Batman V superman in suicide squad and civil war all
 look amazing enough said"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why can't Batman V Superman look this freakin good?
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this movie part of the justice league universe in the movies?
CmRih_VtVAs,Love how they synced queen up with the trailer same thing that was done with the dead pool trailer! Makes it even more enjoyable then it already is!!
CmRih_VtVAs,ommmmmg
CmRih_VtVAs,DC  RULES!  <3
CmRih_VtVAs,JARED LETO AS THE JOKER! I can't wait to show you my toys!!!🔪🃏💋🔫♦️👏🏾🙌🏾

CmRih_VtVAs,Fucking great trailer that was. So excited.
CmRih_VtVAs,"QUEEN IS LIFE, AND THIS IS AMAZING."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is so good
CmRih_VtVAs,"So, not only do the decide to make Joker look like... that, but it turns out the plot twist is him going to be some sort of alien thing? Look at 1:58 if you don't believe me. I had some tiny hopes for this movie, but not even Will Smith can save it for me at this point. I'm disappointed in this and I really didn't want to be. Oh well."
CmRih_VtVAs,I had my doubts... This is going to be an amazing movie! Leto is going to be an awesome Joker.
CmRih_VtVAs,Mamameya !
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 best scene
CmRih_VtVAs,I still dont see why people will like Jared Leto as the Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,*--*
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, at least I still have suicide squad to look forward to."
CmRih_VtVAs,BRB. MUST CHANGE PANTS.
CmRih_VtVAs,Tem como se apaixonar por um trailer ? TEM SIM <3
CmRih_VtVAs,Wowsa! That looks even better than I thought it would be.
CmRih_VtVAs,the best trailer ever
CmRih_VtVAs,"Mais que caralho foi isso!? ','"
CmRih_VtVAs,What did the voices in Harley's head really say?
CmRih_VtVAs,Who are the suicide squad fighting. Who is the villain that they are assigned to stop?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Honestly I don't care about DC but I can't argue, this trailer looks amazing. Can't Marvel and DC fans just get along?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Take the Queen song out and this is just your average, shitty Hollywood trailer."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn is so hot!

CmRih_VtVAs,The moment I heard Queen I said to me 'THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD''
CmRih_VtVAs,This movies gonna suck. You wanna know why? Because Jai Courtneys actually acting. Only such a bad movie could do so....
CmRih_VtVAs,o si espero con ansias que ya llegue

CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 dat ass
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn's got the look but damn that voice is annoying and forced. DC fails again. :/
CmRih_VtVAs,Jev is my hero
CmRih_VtVAs,Who's the guy at 1:43 ??
CmRih_VtVAs,"I said it when the first trailer came out and I will say it again: I'm way more hyped for this than Batman v Superman and I hope I'm not the only one. Not saying BvS will not be a good movie, in fact I think it will be much better than most of the people think, but this just looks wonderful."
CmRih_VtVAs,love how the trailer had a lot of harley in it 😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,eh  ..still gonna go watch it ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome!!!!! wish dey could have shown a lil bit of batman too...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ho this is good... this is real good...

When Harley quin says.....woohhow...immediately got to know what they are going for in this movie..."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wait... is Joker jumping into a chemical vat..? Wait I don't understand...
CmRih_VtVAs,"So I just googled to see what was written on the vandalized mannequins. It was ""Si vis pacem, para bellum"" which means ""If you want peace, prepare for war""... That's it. I had nothing else to say. 😂"
CmRih_VtVAs,"anyone knows who is the guy that is destroying the train? is he the main villain, metalo maybe?"
CmRih_VtVAs,batman v superman can take a hike
CmRih_VtVAs,"""We're bad guys! It's what we do!""
Perfect ending to a perfect trailer!"
CmRih_VtVAs,QUEEEEEEEEEEEEN!!!!!!! <3
CmRih_VtVAs,sends shivers down my spine yeah !
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm just not feeling Will Smith in this. He may be the weak link...or he may fine but for now I'm not feeling it.
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS JOKER IS SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,"I agree, Margot Robbie was a great choice to play Harley, but CMON! Where is her accent!? That's what makes Harley! Otherwise, great trailer! So excited!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"so as my nerves calm, i'm trying to figure out who the fuck is tearing the train apart, who could they possibly be fighting damnit!?"
CmRih_VtVAs,CARALHOOOOOO
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer rocks on multiple levels. So much win.
CmRih_VtVAs,"First ""decently produced"" trailer I have seen in a while. Actually makes me want to see this movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Who here is more hyped for this movie than batman vs superman!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Boomerang is CRAAAAAZY HILARIOUS.
CmRih_VtVAs,First Trailer Is better than this..
CmRih_VtVAs,Kinda want Harley to look more like Harley. The hair and attitude is fine just... it will take some getting used to.
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes. I absolutely love this trailer. I really enjoyed the comic con trailer but this one just made me extremely more excited and happy about Suicide Squad.  Jared Leto's laugh is insane. And Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is just spot on casting. I loved everything and everyone in this trailer. Thank you DC.
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't wait for Batman V Superman anymore!!! I need Suicide Squad!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"that's fucking beautiful
(edit) oh god, i was so wrong"
CmRih_VtVAs,like the soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,Crazy #SuicideSquad #Queen #BohemianRhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,I think I saw freddy in the trailer too
CmRih_VtVAs,What is the name of the song?
CmRih_VtVAs,Weird that I'm more stoked for this and Deadpool more than anything else. SS!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"So flashy but shallow. Are we supposed to care about these assholes? I look forward to never paying over my cash to see this movie. Not a penny, WB."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 DZAMOR ??
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't even want to see the god damn movie and then they turn around and use queen! these bitches are cheatin
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm more hyped about Suicide Squad then Batman Vs Superman! This trailer was AWESOME!
CmRih_VtVAs,Good ol' Bohemian Rhapsody going with the suicide squad trailer is super awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,I CAN'T WAIT FOR TICKETS TO GO ON SALE!!!!!! IM GONNA WATCH IT IN IMAX 3D PREMIER THURSDAY!

CmRih_VtVAs,This looks like an insanely fun time!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Call me crazy, but I think Jai Courtney is going to steal the show. Don't kill me..."
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer shuts down all hype for any other movie. It is now officially my most anticipated movie of the year. HOLY FUCK IM SO FUCKING EXCITED LIKE ACTUALLY I'VE WATCHED THIS TRAILER A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY DEAR FUCK OMG IM CRYING
CmRih_VtVAs,"YES, (repeat a thousand times over)"
CmRih_VtVAs,"A perfect trailer :D, Well done."
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'm not sure if Jared Leto will be better than Heath Ledger, but I'm sure he will be better than anyone ever expected.."
CmRih_VtVAs,holy fuck this actually looks good. seriously why even bother with BvS? this looks SOOO much better
CmRih_VtVAs,Playing a queen song doesn't make this over-hyped pile of shit a good movie
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie looks like shit. No cinematography and a cast full of try hards. It disgraces what Nolan did for the Batman franchise.
CmRih_VtVAs,ESSE FILME VEIO PRA FODER GERAL
CmRih_VtVAs,"Holy shit, is Jai Courtenay... Acting?"
CmRih_VtVAs,this looks AWESOME

CmRih_VtVAs,Me encanto!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,OH MY FUCKING GOD THIS TRAILER LOOKS DOPE AF LORD HELP MARVEL
CmRih_VtVAs,this is the single greatest movie trailer in cinema history
CmRih_VtVAs,Finally DC. you've got me in now. no more new footage please. just revamp this before release if you want to inform audiences
CmRih_VtVAs,"1: 20 Jared Leto''s Joker: MESMERIZING!
2: 07 Harley Quinn's booty: WOW!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Is it me or am I way more hyped for this than BvS? And when I say ""way more hyped"" I mean like by A LOT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Here's a thought...why is Harley Quinn in this team? I like her a lot but she seems more likely to be a liability with her insanity and connections with The Joker than she is as an asset and not to mention Boomerang, Croc, Deadshot, and the others seem to fit in their roles of the team perfectly but HQ just seems to be out there"
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fucking crap.
CmRih_VtVAs,The song made this movie looks like a comedy parody movie XD but anyway I enjoyed it it's hilarious
CmRih_VtVAs,Cinematic perfection
CmRih_VtVAs,nkikaery
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG I love i want see you
CmRih_VtVAs,I just got out of the shower and saw that this was up and long story short I had to stuff my mouth with a towel to stop from screaming so loud. I am SO READY.
CmRih_VtVAs,Who else paused at 2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks cheesy. And no, I'm not a Marvel fanboy. But this and Batman v Superman look underwhelming."
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit Batman and Joker are fighting at 2:34! A dream come true!
CmRih_VtVAs,"saw this when it aired on tv it was great still great Jared Leto is phenomenal as The Joker, The Mark Hamill of the live action world if you will"
CmRih_VtVAs,What are they fighting?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hope this trailer is not better than the movie. because kind it looks like they put the best of the movie in it, and thats bad."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is gonna rival Heath Ledger idc what anyone says...
CmRih_VtVAs,"Para  que  quieres  saber  eso.  todos  sabemos la verdad   esta  Genial el trailer 
Y para  que quieres saber lo otro       JAJAJAJA  SALUDOS"
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like the perfect team for Deadpool.
CmRih_VtVAs,Explanation of what's going on at 1:52 ???
CmRih_VtVAs,Replaying the video again and again
CmRih_VtVAs,No pornhub tonight
CmRih_VtVAs,Me segura mainha que esse trailer ta do caralho
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow!!!!! Is a epic movie

CmRih_VtVAs,IRMÃOCINHO
CmRih_VtVAs,Also 1:21 jason todd maybe?
CmRih_VtVAs,Only thing i find weird is how dark and serious the previous trailer was last year and this one is hilarious.
CmRih_VtVAs,"this is so cool because the last trailer was SO SOMBER and so ~dramatic and that's good and fun and all, but this one was point blank just so fucking fun to watch. seriously one of the best trailers i've seen in SO long. i'm a little disheartened by harley's lack of accent but either way, i'm hype."
CmRih_VtVAs,"""i can't wait to show you my toys""
""Like your Xbox and stuff?""
**opens door**"
CmRih_VtVAs,Why does it feel like it's more of a Will Smith movie  than a DC movie
CmRih_VtVAs,Hilário e aterrorizante kkkk
CmRih_VtVAs,"HOL UP 

So u be sayn..."
CmRih_VtVAs,"This movie looks really, really, really hipster! My sister and I will probably go to see it together with some of my classmates. I've been reading the Babs Tarr Batgirl comic which is a very colorful and fun comic and it's nice to see DC Comics embracing a brighter, colorful and good clean fun outlook with their movies instead of going all dark, ultraviolent and depressing like they did with those stupid and God forsaken Christipher Nolan Batman movies. I wish DC Comics had a Suicide Squad comic that was cool like the Batgirl comics with either Sara Pichelli or Riley Rossmo doing the Suicide Squad interior art."
CmRih_VtVAs,ok so this trailer looks shitty but ill probably end up seeing it anyway. honestly if they make a shit romance between harley and the joker i will literally walk out im not joking
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith saying ""Let's go save the world"" gave me deja-vu."
CmRih_VtVAs,What a generation to be superhero fans again!!! Both DC and Marvel!
CmRih_VtVAs,Yes man I'm so excited especially since my favorite song is played in the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,i like how the guns matches the drums =)
CmRih_VtVAs,100% of the hate is coming from marvel fans lmfao
CmRih_VtVAs,fucking love it 😍
CmRih_VtVAs,Já estou vendo que o Capitão Boomerang vai ser o mais engraçado e pavio curto desse filme haha! AMEI O TRAILER!! (I'm already seeing that Captain Boomerang will be the funniest and fuse short film that haha! I LOVED THE TRAILER !!)
CmRih_VtVAs,Loooooool
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker surrounded by knives laughing yes :)
CmRih_VtVAs,HOW IN THE WORLD DID SOMETHING SO SHORT FELT SO GOOD!!! I am straight and my nipples got hard .
CmRih_VtVAs,"krlllllll eu não to bemmmmmmmmm,to no chão arrasada com esse trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is probably gonna be Jai Courtney's most memorable role tbh
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone else think this looks better than Batman v Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,I thought i saw Tom hardy many times in the trailer ....
CmRih_VtVAs,"Any Leto joker haters left ???? Hello ??? 
i dont hear anything......"
CmRih_VtVAs,This could be D.C ' year... Or maybe not
CmRih_VtVAs,😍😍😍😍
CmRih_VtVAs,I AM FREAKING OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,wtf...
CmRih_VtVAs,to less about joker in  this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie....
CmRih_VtVAs,First trailer made this look amazing and this makes the movie look kind of lame and just Jared Leto is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Wack
CmRih_VtVAs,"<-  
Wow Good!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"She had me at ""Hi Boys""!!!!!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"2:07 

You're welcome."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Aw, no accent :( I wonder if Margot just couldn't pull it off."
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow. This looks rally godo!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Jokers earings 1:53
CmRih_VtVAs,Groot??? 1:44
CmRih_VtVAs,Its pretty such impossible to dislike this trailer. It's truly a well-made and exciting trailer. You get a glimpse of each character and you get the gist of the movie without actually getting any hint of the plot at all so no unnecessary SPOILERS ruin it! Plus you get Queen so what more could you ask for? haha
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel is better
CmRih_VtVAs,Cannot believe we have to wait over 6 months to see this! Looks amazing. Jared as the Joker looks terrifying! Margot as Harley is the perfect Crazy and starting to like Will as Deadshot.
CmRih_VtVAs,CAralho DC me comeeee!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Cadê os BRs falando que o coringa parece o MC Guime ? kkkkkk
CmRih_VtVAs,I kinda wished harley's voice was a bit higher pitch
CmRih_VtVAs,Is it bad that I'm attracted to Harley Quinn
CmRih_VtVAs,I liked the darker tone the first trailer had. this one seems campy
CmRih_VtVAs,jared oh my god
CmRih_VtVAs,@ 1:24 thats hugo strange with the gun....looks like the squad is going to fight echantress
CmRih_VtVAs,Editing is fucking flawless 
CmRih_VtVAs,What book is Harley reading?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is batshit crazy. And I want to watch it so bad. Combining the best VFX of the millenium, with the best actors of today, and probably the best plot there is. 

Pure crazy. No one should watch this. And yet, you really really should. 

Count me in. Twice...



...way more than three times."
CmRih_VtVAs,IM GOING TO LOVE THE JOKER I KNOW IT
CmRih_VtVAs,"What did I just witness? Marvel, I'm so sorry.... But if you haven't picked a plot to bury yourself.. Might as well pick one now."
CmRih_VtVAs,"THE TRAILER IS SO GOOD , I'm CRYINGGGG"
CmRih_VtVAs,WTF is The Joker in a toxic pool with Harley like dead? o_O
CmRih_VtVAs,Isto é a vida real? Eu estou tendo alucinações?
CmRih_VtVAs,she so hot
CmRih_VtVAs,Good night Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,my body is ready
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the real life
CmRih_VtVAs,Congratulations for the badass Captain Boomerang.
CmRih_VtVAs,"They didn't even have to show Batman to prove to us this is going to be incredible. David Ayer, you fucking nailed it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,margot robbie i love it
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS IS DOPE
CmRih_VtVAs,The joker jumping to save harley? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT?????
CmRih_VtVAs,speech less right nks
CmRih_VtVAs,Its....perfect!

CmRih_VtVAs,asco de trailer no me gusto -_- el primer trailer estuvo un millon de veces mejor! .l.
CmRih_VtVAs,i'm going to cry I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE!!
CmRih_VtVAs,joker is such a pimp lol
CmRih_VtVAs,"Ooh, this is definitely DC's answer to Guardians of the Galaxy, and you know what, I'm freaking excited! I didn't expect to see this much enthusiasm from the DCEU!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Surprisingly, Im more excited for Deadpool than this movie. And no, Im not a Marvel butthurt fanboy"
CmRih_VtVAs,best thing is the song Queen bohemian rhapsody
CmRih_VtVAs,eu devo estar sonhando...  queen... ó meu deus. sdd flash reverso
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here for the joker Mr. Leto didn't disapoint
CmRih_VtVAs,siento algo extraño al ver este trailer como que no me siento muy emocionado como cuando vi el primero
CmRih_VtVAs,I love this trailer more than the Batman V Superman trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow, was not expecting to acting care about this movie, now I can't stop thinking about it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Mixed feelings.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Jared Leto is gonna kill the role, contrary to popular belief"
CmRih_VtVAs,"""LIKE"" if you watched over 10 times!!!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,fodastico

CmRih_VtVAs,Why am I more excited for this than Batman V Superman?
CmRih_VtVAs,reminds me of the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy
CmRih_VtVAs,At last they gave colors ace letters. HAHAHA
CmRih_VtVAs,This is fucking shit
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:23
Anyone else seem the guy whit the big-eye mask from certain anime?"
CmRih_VtVAs,"After reading the shot by shot description of this trailer, I thought that Harley's ""It's the voices"" thing, wasn't going to actually be funny. But every time I replay the trailer, I always find myself cracking the biggest smile at that part! Margot Robbie will own this role!"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm super excited for this marvel and dc fan boy no sides for me I love them both I'm just a geek lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm disappointed because there was no Batman in this trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Look, I've been impaled."
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian rhapsody is a good song but overused at this point it made the trailer meh
CmRih_VtVAs,"What is this, a sitcom??"
CmRih_VtVAs,ya no saquen mas contenido!

CmRih_VtVAs,"This looks excellent, love the new joker."

CmRih_VtVAs,leto reminded me of freddy in nightmare 3 with that suit and he looks fucking scary as hell damn don't fuck with his joker
CmRih_VtVAs,"Cringe tear @ 0:53

Also, this looks miles better than BvS. I guess that's what happens when you have a competent director."
CmRih_VtVAs,why couldnt they make the batman v superman trailer like this? didnt give the plot away yet still made me psyched to watch it
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer teaches us: ""Sometimes, Heroes and villains are alike!"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Wow this looks really bad lmao
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie steals the show! BadShit Craaazzzyyyyyyy!
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW! I... AM... SPEECHLESS!!! but I'll think of something to say later.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody made this trailer 1000x better.
CmRih_VtVAs,1:44 who is it?????? And alien???? Help me!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG OMG OMG OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,SI VIS PACEM PARA BELLUM
CmRih_VtVAs,This is going to be awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,1:22 terrifying lol
CmRih_VtVAs,Where is Harley's accent?
CmRih_VtVAs,If you are going to judge a film by its trailer...wait until you actually see the movie then you can judge it
CmRih_VtVAs,This one is really better !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,worst movie ever? #soon :v
CmRih_VtVAs,This is likely the one and only trailer that had ever made me feel a burst of adrenaline. I'm that excited. haha its making me regret not getting into the comic realm when I was younger (time to question all my life choices hahaaha)
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07
CmRih_VtVAs,ME ENCANTA!! OJALA SALGA SUBTITULADO MUY PRONTO :/
CmRih_VtVAs,take my money now
CmRih_VtVAs,Does anyone think the other villain in this could be Brainiac? idk any other villain who has those type of powers and it is certainly not joker lol
CmRih_VtVAs,I am crying because this is pure shit!
CmRih_VtVAs,Now who the he'll dislike it
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks like shit. No matter how hard DC try they're just not going to top Marvel.
CmRih_VtVAs,justo en el punto G *-*
CmRih_VtVAs,ohhh lord this gonna be so sweet
CmRih_VtVAs,JAI COURTNEY THE REAL MVP
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fuck! This jumped to my 2nd most anticipated after BvS.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I never said this
But I think I'm actually excited for August"
CmRih_VtVAs,02:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
CmRih_VtVAs,Dessa vez a DC mitou.
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the movie where the fresh prince becomes an anti hero?
CmRih_VtVAs,I fuckin love this trailer!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,This is gonna wipe the floor with BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,morta
CmRih_VtVAs,"I think they used the wrong music. The song is to joyful for a grim movie. Even the movie seems like a comedy rather than a suicide mission.
For me the cool part about DC universe is the darker and more serious tone. Now it's trying to follow marvel's more comedic style."
CmRih_VtVAs,annnnnnd Harley doesnt have her accent. Boycotted for not be faithful to Harley
CmRih_VtVAs,"This may not only be the first film of August, but the first original comic book movie of all-time to break $1 billion worldwide."
CmRih_VtVAs,I came for Harley Quinn. Watched the entire trailer and have yet to see her.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Woman in the Vídeo: ""the worst of the worst""
Me: ""THE BEST OF THE BEST"""
CmRih_VtVAs,THIS WAS AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,"Looks better than Superman vs Batman, but I never really set my hopes that high with that film."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dear Z. Snyder, this is how you hype people... you dont have to release all the good stuffs just to be noticed .."
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07 somebody make a gif
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell yeah!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared looks fantastic.
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't stop watching the trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,song?
CmRih_VtVAs,2:07  you r welcome ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,Too bad Kung Fu Panda will crush this movie.
CmRih_VtVAs,One of the best trailers I've ever seen.
CmRih_VtVAs,noice
CmRih_VtVAs,wooow!!!! a comic fan must ralize that this year is going to rock for MARVEL and DC 😢❤
CmRih_VtVAs,"OMG,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,WOW ... WORST HEROES EVER .... and that's actually a compliment :)  LOVE this fricking trailer.
CmRih_VtVAs,This is the year that Marvel and DC will have a prosperous year.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks fucking insaaaaaannneeeeeee. I can't wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,lol why is joker so weird I think this is going to be the best joker we've seen yet!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I did pis,  literally 😂😂😘😘"
CmRih_VtVAs,Mama mia
CmRih_VtVAs,Or is it just fantasy
CmRih_VtVAs,"Dessa vez o Oscar vem, né Will?"
CmRih_VtVAs,Estuprei o replay.
CmRih_VtVAs,I wish Harley did more squats
CmRih_VtVAs,I don't like DC as much but this looks promising as hell !
CmRih_VtVAs,"Pennsatucky OINK?? 

Really bad choice with the Soundtrack to this trailer"
CmRih_VtVAs,opposite of kick-ass they are heroes but doing badly
CmRih_VtVAs,"You guys might want to rename the video Trailer 2, just saying...."
CmRih_VtVAs,It would be very interesting to see villains take the spotlight instead of heros
CmRih_VtVAs,ew.. it looks horrible
CmRih_VtVAs,"this trailer is epic, i loved <3"
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is awesome!!! :-D
CmRih_VtVAs,"Well, that was exciting"
CmRih_VtVAs,This is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Gave me chills. I'm more excited for the movie and it comes out on my birthday
CmRih_VtVAs,"The previous trailer made it look dramatic, this one is playful, talk about mixed messaging. "
CmRih_VtVAs,this joker looks like he'd cause batman more trouble then the one from dark knight
CmRih_VtVAs,huge grin on my face while watching this. great trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Monsters.
CmRih_VtVAs,I haven't seen a trailer so many times in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Hi
CmRih_VtVAs,WHY ISN'T DAVID AYER DIRECTING EVERY OTHER DC MOVIE?!?!?!?!?!? This looks incredible...this and deadpool same year omfg
CmRih_VtVAs,PLEASE KEEP THE TRAILERS LIKE THIS DONT MESS UP LIKE BATMAN V SUPERMAN PLEASE
CmRih_VtVAs,copiandose de guardians pero mal hecho
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow that was just completely original, The music is a odd fit but I loved that color scheme for the logo, works really nice on the eyes. Beside that Will Smith being badass as always, Harley looks great, Leto definitely not the Joker we are used too but very original touch and surpisingly I'm like Rick Flag. Fuck it the trailer was badass."
CmRih_VtVAs,perfecto ya se cogieron a todas las películas de marvel juntas jajaja
CmRih_VtVAs,SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,Help. I can't stop watching it
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant believe the song they matched the trailer to.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I'M SO FUCKING READY! TAKE MY MONEY! I was expecting a Harley Quinn accent, but at least the persona is there. Margot looks great!  Deadshot looks badass shooting the shit out of whatever (that knee slide tho!), Joker looks even better (especially with his different attire), Boomerang looks funny as hell (in a good way), and the rest look just as bad ass as everyone else. This movie looks very promising, can't wait to see it!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"MELS
DELS
DO
CELS"
CmRih_VtVAs,the tralier is so cool at time 2:31
CmRih_VtVAs,This look more fun than Guardians of the Galaxy! I can't wait to see it!
CmRih_VtVAs,Awesome.
CmRih_VtVAs,Why just why
CmRih_VtVAs,"You know, The secret life of Walter Mitty also had Bohemian Rhapsody playing in the trailer, so either this movie actually has it on the soundtrack or it's just an attention bringer."
CmRih_VtVAs,1:23
CmRih_VtVAs,AMAZING
CmRih_VtVAs,Único trailer que não   abaixou a minhas espectativas :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Just bring this muthaphucka ON already!!
CmRih_VtVAs,love it!!
CmRih_VtVAs,DC se  va a garchar a Marvel...
CmRih_VtVAs,Suicide squad > Batman v superman
CmRih_VtVAs,"I don't care what is better between Marvel and DC, I just enjoy the movies"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie é tão perfeita que deveria ser usado como elogio, então só posso descrever esse trailer com duas palavras Margot Robbie"
CmRih_VtVAs,I can't wait for Cinemasins to review this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"Meu Deus!!!!  Quero Agosto já !!!!!  Que Perfeição,  que Fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
CmRih_VtVAs,Enough already of comparing Leto's Joker to Ledger's. Leto will be an awesome Joker
CmRih_VtVAs,I rapped that reply buttom. I did...
CmRih_VtVAs,BEST.TRAILER.EVER!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Make way for the bad guys.
CmRih_VtVAs,DC knock out Marvel for 2nd time
CmRih_VtVAs,Am i the only one who wants to fuck the shit out of Harley Quinn?
CmRih_VtVAs,1:59 EDIT: Looks like some sort of chemicals that references the origins of the Joker. Saving Harley though? Wat.
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody gives me eargasms with this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy fucking shit! 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👊👊👊👊❤️❤️❤️
CmRih_VtVAs,EAT ASS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I can't be the only one to think this...

To me, I have never been more excited for a ""superhero"" (Villain) movie. DC is trying out the whole movie on a select villains first, and I like it. I know comics wise there has been so many story arcs focusing on different villains. This isn't even a competition to me anymore. I love Marvel and DC. But you can't argue that DC does have slightly better movies and TV series. Agents of Shield and Daredevil (both great shows though) can't compete with Arrow and Flash. I understand they are two different companies! But then when it comes to movies it seems to me that Marvel planted their feet in 2008 (i think) with the release of iron man. Then people stared to really like Marvel movies again. I haven't noticed, or seen, any bad or subpar DC movie! (Minus Superman :/) Marvels Spider-Man is DC Superman. Both heroes you want to see be great but the movies don't make them that way!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah, this movie is going to be rated a very close to a rated R.  Its going to be a very violent, PG-13."
CmRih_VtVAs,Anyone Have any Idea who the guy smashing through the train is ?  the Demon looking guys?
CmRih_VtVAs,"The trailer doesn't have a dark feel like the first, but surprisingly still works."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Usaron a Queen como soundtrack? *Oye pero que transgresor*, más razones para verla"
CmRih_VtVAs,MY DICK IS SO HARD RIGHT NOW IM FUCKING MY IPAD AAAHHHHH
CmRih_VtVAs,finally been waiting for this
CmRih_VtVAs,This is quite possibly the best movie trailer in a while.
CmRih_VtVAs,"sorry but is true, suicide squad looks better than BvS

SUICIDE SQUAD >>> BvS"
CmRih_VtVAs,DC FUCKING WINS!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,R.I.P. MARVEL 2007-2016
CmRih_VtVAs,Can we just drop the fan-war?! IS THAT SERIOUSLY TOO MUCH TO ASK!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"This trailer right here is a definite gold! Aww man, that Captain Boomerang cracks me up."
CmRih_VtVAs,GOZEI
CmRih_VtVAs,Will Smith never fails!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Estrupando o play caraiiii....que trailer dahoraaa!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Very happy to see that stupid ""no jokes"" policy of DC's ended up being bullshit."
CmRih_VtVAs,"estou jogando na tela ,mas nada acontece ...."
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is AMAZING!
CmRih_VtVAs,kinda let down by Harley's voice but other than that I'M PSYCHED! AND THE JOKER IS THE EPITOME OF CRAZY love it
CmRih_VtVAs,"CARALHO, VELHOOOOOOO 
MEU DEUSSSSS"
CmRih_VtVAs,Has a lot more Joker in this trailer....I like it.
CmRih_VtVAs,O trailer já era foda de qualquer jeito ai a warner pega e me coloca Bohemian Rhapsody pra foder com tudo e ficar mais foda ainda <3
CmRih_VtVAs,this is a masterpiece!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love it but not the soundtrack, even thought it fits well."
CmRih_VtVAs,No Batman!! Why???
CmRih_VtVAs,CARALHO QUE TRAILER FODA MARGOT ROBBIE EU TE AMO!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,escape from reality!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Did you guys see batman choking the Joker at 2:33
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer is way better than the recent trailer for BvS
CmRih_VtVAs,looks terrible
CmRih_VtVAs,OMG
CmRih_VtVAs,Alguien sabe el nombre de la canción?
CmRih_VtVAs,No hay manera de explicar lo épico que es.
CmRih_VtVAs,Now that's a good ass trailer! Didn't show the plot but showed a hell lot of scenes! I'm just loving this
CmRih_VtVAs,"i hate the new joker,don't get me wrong,i'm not saying that jared is not going to do its work like he should,i just hate the new joker"
CmRih_VtVAs,damn
CmRih_VtVAs,What a kickass trailer! GO DC!
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this really happening?!?! :)
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is going to KILL IT. She's perfect.
CmRih_VtVAs,This looks SO much better than Batman Vs Superman!
CmRih_VtVAs,awsome
CmRih_VtVAs,that shit looks dope
CmRih_VtVAs,Vou dormir agora e acordar na estreia !!!!!!!!!!! FODA
CmRih_VtVAs,What was that internet? All doubts about Leto's Joker melting away in a neon orgasm?
CmRih_VtVAs,"So excited, even more than for Civil War"
CmRih_VtVAs,Greatest trailer ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,That was awesome!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Oh my God... cannot wait!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I loved the easter eggs. A psychotic Joker, a crazy and funny Harley.. Damn DC, you're doing it GREAT!"
CmRih_VtVAs,"Hero or villain.
Marvel or Dc.
WHO CARES, 2016 IS GONNA BE AWESOME"
CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT IF the chemicals that Joker jumps in to get Harley from end up removing all their tattoos?
CmRih_VtVAs,am i the only one who got that guardians of the galaxy vibe?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is gonna be a good one.
I think Harley is my favorite so far."
CmRih_VtVAs,That Michigan Wolverines shirt at 0:37 though 😏
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:05 back to Chicago. Fuck, we love destroying that place."
CmRih_VtVAs,".......Okay, fuck it, I MIGHT need to go see this one. XD"
CmRih_VtVAs,"It's... horrible. C'mong. Point to MARVEL, a movie about 6 sinixter is better"
CmRih_VtVAs,far better than the first trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,I came here ready to hate on this but I kinda like this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,"That..took a turn. First trailer seemed super dark and serious, almost an extension of Nolan's Batman universe. This trailer is significantly brighter and has a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe."
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one around here who thinks this looks trash and will be trash? Don't give into the hype people.
CmRih_VtVAs,who is that @1:44 ?
CmRih_VtVAs,Could they have made it look any cornier?
CmRih_VtVAs,"Good bye Guardians of the Galaxy
Suicide Squad is here"
CmRih_VtVAs,Kill V. Main by Grimes could suit really well in this trailer
CmRih_VtVAs,Holy shit words can't even describe how good this is.. Suicide squad hype is like a train with the brakes slashed.. I am probably gonna suffer from 'withdrawal' before August comes ;)
CmRih_VtVAs,and batman
CmRih_VtVAs,Hell Yeah!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"For those of you who don't know, the song is by Darude - ""Sandstorm"""
CmRih_VtVAs,amazing !!! (viva chile)
CmRih_VtVAs,"""I can't wait to show you my toys"""
CmRih_VtVAs,Sad thing is this looks better than the superman V Batman Dawn of justice
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:35 when he opens that beer and then the song hits. Epic as shit. More excited for this than all the other DC,Marvel stuff coming out this year."
CmRih_VtVAs,Can't go wrong with queen but I wish this movie had black manta
CmRih_VtVAs,fuckin awesome
CmRih_VtVAs,The Q on the signs face represents harley
CmRih_VtVAs,Any ideas on who that is at 1:43?
CmRih_VtVAs,take my money bruh
CmRih_VtVAs,Wowwwwww ya quiero que se estrene para ir al cine !!!
CmRih_VtVAs,There is a lot of stuff in this Trailer And Joker is Crazy Jumping like that :D Hyped
CmRih_VtVAs,Mejores villanos que en todo MCU?
CmRih_VtVAs,the most beautiful thing i have ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,"I hope that this movie's good enough to have a sequel, and at the same time, I hope that it's good enough that a sequel would just ruin it."
CmRih_VtVAs,E esses deslikes ai vai tomar no cu seus arrombado
CmRih_VtVAs,"kick ass trailer, harley is hot and crazy/hilarious.. but it's going to drive me insane her not having a brocklyn accent -_-"
CmRih_VtVAs,Is this the real life?...
CmRih_VtVAs,"""What was that? I should kill everyone and escape?"" - Harley Quinn 😍😍😍"
CmRih_VtVAs,Türkler kendini belli etsin
CmRih_VtVAs,"1:43 What/who is that? After the ""Heroes"" text."
CmRih_VtVAs,HOLY SHIT!HAAAAAAA QUE DELÍCIA
CmRih_VtVAs,This trailer really does this movie justice
CmRih_VtVAs,Best.  Trailer.  Ever.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I didn't think the first trailer could get any better, and then this comes along !!!!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Esse filme vai ser épico #BR #SuicideSquad
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian rhapsody🙌🙌🙌
CmRih_VtVAs,wow increible

CmRih_VtVAs,"Margot Robbie is freaking perfect as Harley Quinn, Leto's Joker seems great. My only problem with this trailer is that it gives the movie a cheesy, overly comedic tone, don't like that. I hope the actual movie is more serious."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Finally, DC is having fun with its universe which is how the comics are with it's characters. This bullshit Nolan era clinging on do DC being extremely Dark and serious and they are having fun. So the people complaining really I don't know what you wanted unless you wanted the Dark Knight again repackaged I say fuck that DC is about to introduce Supernatural and fucking other characters like Flash and Hal Jordan characters that are NOT ULTRA SERIOUS like they are trying to win an Oscar."

Like with the last preview ""trailer"", everyone went berzerk and analyzed every minute detail, like figuring out what was happening in that Joker scene when it was literally a couple of seconds long.

Harley Quinn is awesome, I really wish I had gotten into comics earlier in my life!!! I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT!"

CmRih_VtVAs,"Well Bohemian Rhapsody sales on itunes will go up just a tad today. The trailer looks fun not so much dark. Not sure if that's a good thing considering they are villains and some of them are going to die. Even if you are not familiar with title's source material some regular moviegoers might wonder why it's so lighthearted considering the name of film. Other than Snow White and huntsman looking gunmen, gooey tentacle porn, and Enchantress's fart cloud aurora, its looks to be  entertaining flick."
CmRih_VtVAs,I just hope the movie  is as good as the trailers
CmRih_VtVAs,Bismillah!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Does anyone have an idea of who the main ""bad guy"" will be, because if it's the thing at 1:43 I have know idea who it is."

CmRih_VtVAs,"I for one can try to respect both companies. this looks decent. but, for the hell of it let's see how many butthurt DC fans will reply. marvel is better with better characters, better movies, better shows, and arguably better comics. DC has batman, that's it."

CmRih_VtVAs,Where is BATMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CmRih_VtVAs,Am I the only one excited for Captain Boomerang?
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 is definitely looking good for superhero movies hopefully all the movies will deliver or at least be entertaining and not have another fantastic four situation.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Senti un cosquilleo en mis huevos.

CmRih_VtVAs,Exactly what i was waiting
CmRih_VtVAs,"Just awesome! I believe this will be more important for me than Bat vs Super. I mean, it will be good, I believe, but Suicide Squad looks really nice!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Joker still looks like crap in my opinion but I bet he will have a great performance and Harley well her actor sounds very cheesy like corny idk it might just be me but can't wait for this movie
CmRih_VtVAs,DC ❤️ <3 te ganas mi respeto.

CmRih_VtVAs,Da fuck is Joker doing jumping in another vat of acid? First time wasnt enough?
CmRih_VtVAs,Okay...this is my 7th time watching this ... I can't WAIT! btw this should've been rated R
CmRih_VtVAs,is this the real trailer or is this just fantasy
CmRih_VtVAs,"just kidding that's not what they really said! - harley quinn
i think this movie is gonna be a T.N.T by d.c"
CmRih_VtVAs,Harley Quinn >>>>>> Marvel
CmRih_VtVAs,Who was joker talking to at 1:20
CmRih_VtVAs,Bohemian Rhapsody was a nice touch
CmRih_VtVAs,August wtf

CmRih_VtVAs,What is this some kinda trailer? For some kinda suicide squad?
CmRih_VtVAs,"This is perfect. 

Now this is how you make an established universe without being afraid of your own content. Pretty sure DC just confirmed magic before Marvel would fully even acknowledge it. hah"
CmRih_VtVAs,Not gonna lie... This is probably the greatest trailer I've ever seen
CmRih_VtVAs,quien sabe como se llama la cancion ?
CmRih_VtVAs,"I am anticipating this movie more than Batman V Superman... wait, did I really just say that?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I watched this like 20x already.

CmRih_VtVAs,"Oh, shith !"
CmRih_VtVAs,Song on fleek. Trailer looks solid too.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm so happy I stayed up to watch this on tv so I could watch this 487 more times on my phone
CmRih_VtVAs,So now people were expecting super dark from the first trailer? SS is like that the villains have fun they are sick like that they enjoy what they are doing. Heroes yeah they can be brooding and shit but Villains like these especially Harley and Joker have fun.
CmRih_VtVAs,"Wow over a 100,000 in less than fifteen minutes? People already like this more than Batman V Superman."

CmRih_VtVAs,"Pero mira a ese Jared Leto, papu. 😀"
CmRih_VtVAs,What the fuck is going on here? Who's the villain? What's the point of this whole thing?

CmRih_VtVAs,SIT ON MY FUCKING FACE HARLEY
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm officially excited to see this rather than BvS Dawn of Justice.
CmRih_VtVAs,"WOW.. WHAT THE HELL I JUST WATCHED?? WELL DONE DC, PRETTY FUCKING WELL FUCKING DONE!!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Jared Leto is amazing
CmRih_VtVAs,"So they actually did go with the New 52 origin for Harley! Incredible how powerful that version turned out. And even though many people frowned upon it back then, I approve. One, it ties her even closer to the Joker, as his actual creation. Two, it solidifies his philosophy of bad day."
CmRih_VtVAs,DC JUST WON.. im crying
CmRih_VtVAs,This movie is going to be FUCKING EPIC!
CmRih_VtVAs,THAT WAS EPIC!
CmRih_VtVAs,"Will Smith is back, guys."
CmRih_VtVAs,What a great soundtrack
CmRih_VtVAs,"with the music of Queen is simply the best epic trailer, is great"

CmRih_VtVAs,ALELUIA
CmRih_VtVAs,How times have you guys seen this trailer?
CmRih_VtVAs,2016 may be the best movie year I've ever been alive for.
CmRih_VtVAs,"I was sceptical about Leto's Joker at first. But this has put all my fears to rest, he looks utterly insane and I love it."

Pixar."
CmRih_VtVAs,"Thank you, God, for this movie!"
CmRih_VtVAs,Very cool
CmRih_VtVAs,"As someone who has grown up with Marvel comics, I've always had a big soft spot for Harley and Joker, and to finally see Harley on the big screen will be amazing. This trailer just gets me pumped. I'm way more excited for this than BvS and Civil War and Doctor Strange. This, Rogue One and 10 cloverfield lane are my most anticipated films of the year."
CmRih_VtVAs,I LOVE THIS SHIT
CmRih_VtVAs,awesome!!
CmRih_VtVAs,dead. i'm dead now.
CmRih_VtVAs,ok this definitely looks 1000000 times better than Batman v Superman
CmRih_VtVAs,Margot Robbie is going to be THE FUCKING STAR in this film
CmRih_VtVAs,"Yeah this confirmed my worries. Not liking the style of this movie at all. The costumes look like you would see at comic con. 

I honestly think I am going to hate Leto's Joker.

Also Margot Robbie had the perfect Harley Quinn voice in Wolf of Wall Street....why is she not using it!?"
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm completely paralyzed after this. Amazing fucking trailer!

CmRih_VtVAs,WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?!

CmRih_VtVAs,This is turning out way better than I thought it would.
CmRih_VtVAs,It looks like they're going with the New 52 origin for Harley...

Margot Robbie is queen and Jared Leto looks great and the rest as well. This trailer Jai Courtney has more charisma than he has in his movies because he's working with David Ayer who's a great director.﻿"

CmRih_VtVAs,Holy crap that was amazing.
CmRih_VtVAs,Looks cringey as shit.
CmRih_VtVAs,I'm way more excited for Suicide Squad now!!
CmRih_VtVAs,"I love how Leto seems to be the ""Crazy just flat out Insane Madman"" Joker instead of previous Jokers we've seen on the big screen like the Anarchist Joker (Ledger), Gangster Joker (Nicholson), etc."
CmRih_VtVAs,bohemian raspody😊
CmRih_VtVAs,AMO A DC MANOOOO

CmRih_VtVAs,"Fantastic. Since they seem to be using a lot of 70's music, any guesses as to what 70's band will be featured in the next trailer? I'm gonna go with Zeppelin. I could see them using ""Black Dog""."
CmRih_VtVAs,I doubted Affleck and Leto! Now all I have to say is thank you Zack Snyder! You've given us real life replicas of my childhood heroes & villains!
CmRih_VtVAs,wow
CmRih_VtVAs,I cant help but get a sense of Guardians of the Galaxy but the humor and fun is more dark. So pumped
CmRih_VtVAs,well that tone was not expected.
CmRih_VtVAs,Marvel bildiğin Dc oldu Dc bildiğin Marvel oldu bu ne lan komedi filmi mi Dc filmi mi belli değil biraz ciddiyet olsun yazık ilk fragman ne kadar güzeldi bitti gözümde Dc

CmRih_VtVAs,"I just wish Margo could have a more childlike voice to Harley, movie still looks fantastic"
CmRih_VtVAs,You won me the instant  Bohemian Rhapsody started
CmRih_VtVAs,"I really like the tone they are going for, based on this trailer alone. From the first teaser it looked like we were gonna get the, now commonplace, dark and brooding super hero movie. But based on this it looks way more over the top action and craziness, which I love."
CmRih_VtVAs,MY ANUS IS READY
CmRih_VtVAs,DC won 2016
CmRih_VtVAs,oh my god I LOVE THIS HARLEY AND JOKER

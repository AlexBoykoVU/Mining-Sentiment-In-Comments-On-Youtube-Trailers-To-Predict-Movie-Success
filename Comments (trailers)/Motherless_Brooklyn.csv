Fru8IkuDp_k,This gives me LA Noire vibes ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
Fru8IkuDp_k,I'm in: looks great. All star cast.
Fru8IkuDp_k,tenet?????
Fru8IkuDp_k,Is this better than Human Centipede?
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks kind of stupid
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton is a great actor but Alec Baldwin is a pass for me.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Jerry Lewis was not available for the lead role.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Like this
Fru8IkuDp_k,Brooklyn is the trash capitol of the U.S. Human garbage. Right along with New Orleans.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I def wanna see this.
Fru8IkuDp_k,So he‚Äôs playing the brian character again from the score.
Fru8IkuDp_k,The book is fantastic as well.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"1:06 >sees Pennsylvania Station






*Nuts in PRR GG1*"
Fru8IkuDp_k,So good to see Tourette's on stage like this. I never saw it either.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Norton is back
Fru8IkuDp_k,Best Director maybe for Oscars as best actor win is already a given for mr phoenix ...
Fru8IkuDp_k,i've missed edward norton so much
Fru8IkuDp_k,It remind me of Mikey from mafia 2 .
Fru8IkuDp_k,"If you're gonna see this, please read the amazing book as well!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,The match scene was hilarious
Fru8IkuDp_k,So they just basically tell us Bruce willis dies?
Fru8IkuDp_k,I got a bit of Tourettes from abusing opioids.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I GOT THREADS IN MY HEAD MAN!
Fru8IkuDp_k,This is an SNL skit right lol?
Fru8IkuDp_k,Id say him and phoenix as co winners of the oscar award.
Fru8IkuDp_k,michael k williams! at least there's one Brooklyn actor in this movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I've wanted to see this ever since I heard he was doing a TS movie and knew if anyone could pull it off it'd be him. He's fantastic. As someone with TS and many other mental illnesses that come with it, it's never been an easy road. I'm blessed that i don't have to be on any meds for it, and suffer very mildly now with tics, but as a child growing up with it, i was a ticking time bomb and wouldn't wish it on anyone. I suffer from depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD, and I'm super emo so it's been a challange but it could be worse. Much, much worse. I can't imagine being so ticcy as an adult. Most ppl don't believe that i have it. I'm just thankful. He's such an amazing deep actor."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ive missed Ed Norton. Wonderful actor
Fru8IkuDp_k,I can't recall ever seeing a film with a protagonist with Tourette's so this seems really unique
Fru8IkuDp_k,As someone with tourettes he does an amazing job with making it seem real
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I am 1000% sure this movie will obtain several Oscar nominations and will get one (probably more than one)... Great production, formidable actors and tremendous script (amazing story), an excellent film!!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Fucking love this guy.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I cannot stand Alec Baldwin.... he is way low deep state communist.... also he lacks self control.... narcissism  shows everytime he opens his mouth the smell of putrid rot escapes.... Hollyweird...actually thinks he has something worthy to say...
Fru8IkuDp_k,Finally he did what he wanted.. to be the director and the writer
Fru8IkuDp_k,You never go full retarded. Didn't work for simple jack
Fru8IkuDp_k,This movie looks like a dog.
Fru8IkuDp_k,IF
Fru8IkuDp_k,Guguüòç
Fru8IkuDp_k,looks like a great film!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Why I find this movie so similar with Joker?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"cool, looking forward"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Another movie where the main character has to narrate his own story 
We don‚Äôt need a play by play, let the audience be intrigued instead of spelling it out"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Best incredible Hulk ever
Fru8IkuDp_k,Nobody cares!! Fuck- off!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,I'm so looking forward to this. So many excellent actors.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"One of my Favs, Edward Norton!!!!, is backkk üòçüçø"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Who made the soundtrack for this movie?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Saw this at VIFF, it was so good!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,This so sad
Fru8IkuDp_k,I alway's liked period pieces..  This looks good. it's good to see Michael K Williams (chalky white) and Bobby Cannavale (gyp rosetti) from Boardwalk empire too. And Bruce Willis and Ed Norton I alway's liked as well.  :)
Fru8IkuDp_k,Omg I can‚Äôt wait to see this! My daughter has TS and to finally see a movie where this condition is not being mocked it is uplifting for the people and families that live thru this! I‚Äôm excited
Fru8IkuDp_k,Tbh i think i have tourettes. I sometimes just feel the need to say something. Like it could be something that i look at at such as a dog and i feel the need to screamin dog doggie and shit.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Oh give him an Oscar already!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Funny
Fru8IkuDp_k,I want to see this so bad.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Jesus Bruce, Edwards,  Dafoe and Michael K. Williams üôåüèΩI have to see this!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Such a good book. Looks like film is gonna be good as well. WB gonna need the money after the lawsuits pending for this film though. RIP Michael Davidson
Fru8IkuDp_k,You know its going to be good when you hear Ed Norton narrating.  I am Jack's overjoyed bile duct
Fru8IkuDp_k,I loved this book by Jonathan Lethem so much! The trailer looks great.  Not surprised it took 20 years to find the right people to make it.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"ü§§ he's so cute i can't wait for this movie
yea im gay so what üòú"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I can't wait to see this! Ed Norton has made such an impression on me with his acting. I will see anything he's in because I know it will be great.
Fru8IkuDp_k,this looks very promising!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hell yea!
Fru8IkuDp_k,This sounds like autisim
Fru8IkuDp_k,thom torke
Fru8IkuDp_k,he‚Äôs back
Fru8IkuDp_k,"no one:


Edward Norton: YIFF"
Fru8IkuDp_k,This movie might possibly end up being my favorite movie at this time. Right now I‚Äôm struggling with Tourette‚Äôs and adhd and this movie portrays how people with Tourette‚Äôs can take that and make it something good.
Fru8IkuDp_k,this reminds me of 91 days ngl
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Oh yeah, I have to see this!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"WOW, WOW, WOW!  Can't wait to see it!  Love the whole idea about it."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Thom Yorke, the Music God"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Yep, I‚Äôm watching!!!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I was uninterested in hearing him chatter away after 30 seconds, Norton is obnoxious and hearing Baldwin yammer about ""power"" is tedious. So much exposition in one dumb trailer, no thanks"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Was good in *red dragon*
Is good in this one too"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hheelll yyeeaahhh!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Now I‚Äôve got threads in my head stuck in my head üßµ.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Lol at 0:13 ""touch it bailey!!"" I'm sorry"" makes me bust up loud"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hey that‚Äôs the book I‚Äôm reading right now
Fru8IkuDp_k,Motherless Brooklyn looks like It could be a very good movie but I don't pay $0.05 to watch Alex Baldwin anymore. Right Alec you fn moron.  How did you get in a movie now anyway. You dont have to do your kneepads with Harvey gone.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I love period pieces, and I am excited for what the people involved in this film have created. I'm looking forward to Ed's unique character set in this interesting time!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Trailer looked good until I saw that fuck face baldwin ... nexxxtttt
Fru8IkuDp_k,oscar bell is ringing
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed is the GOAT!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I have Tourettes, OCD, ADD, and ADHD so this one hits close to home."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"finally, someone in a movie who's actually like me. Accurate representation and in a way where it isn't the main focal point. I'm 14. TS and OCD and this is the best thing I've ever seen. I've waited so long for something that didn't portray it in a way that made it seem hilarious and non painful. My tics exist. My compulsions exist. And I do too."
Fru8IkuDp_k,1:13 The roll of Violet mints next to the gun. My favorites so hard to find.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"He seems pretty normal to me.  People who we call ""normal"" are boring unlike this guy who has a lot going on in his head."
Fru8IkuDp_k,No Prince obsession then? :(
Fru8IkuDp_k,Could you imagine is E Nort played hulk the entire time? How much more epic the mcu would have been.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"‚ÄúKirk Lazarus : Everybody knows you never go full retard.
Tugg Speedman : What do you mean?
Kirk Lazarus : Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, 'Rain Man,' look retarded, act retarded, not retarded. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic, sho'. Not retarded. You know Tom Hanks, 'Forrest Gump.' Slow, yes. Retarded, maybe. Braces on his legs. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and he won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded. He was a goddamn war hero. You know any retarded war heroes? You went full retard, man. Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, ""I Am Sam."" Remember? Went full retard, went home empty-handed.‚Äù

Motherless Brooklyn is pure Oscar bait. I‚Äôm already seeing critics praising Edward Norton for his ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù portrayal of Tourette‚Äôs syndrome."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Love that cigarette scene! He keeps blowing it out, gets me every time!üòÇ"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Whoa this cast. I read the book in high school. One of the best English class books ever.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I like E.N...
Fru8IkuDp_k,Im exited but I‚Äôm I worried his ticks are gonna set off my ticks in the theater lol
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Oh god I could only really stand Ed‚Äôs character for a short time. Too bad, looks like a great movie."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I was looking for this commercial after I saw it on a add glad I finally found the movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton is another great actor. Im definitely going to see this.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Wow... Just Wow.
Fru8IkuDp_k,OMAR!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"It's about time a project like this came along for Ed Norton. I hope this works for him, even if he may be an ass on the set."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I wonder if Edward Norton aka Derek Vinyard and Ethan Suplee aka Seth Ryan will sing the song from American History X from the van scene and do you think Edward still has that chest tattoo?
Fru8IkuDp_k,He played something similar on 'the Score' with Robert de Niro Angela Bassett and (Marlon Brando's final movie appearance) Ed should be doing a lot more because he's an incredible actor
Fru8IkuDp_k,Fuck this guy is such an actor
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks great but ... Never go full retard!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed's narration style makes good stories great.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Monk in new york
Fru8IkuDp_k,he is always great
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hell yes Norty back in the game!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Gonna be a hell of a competition this year for the oscar : Pheonix as Joker, or Norton as Lionel."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I wanted to see this until I saw that Baldwin piece of s***
Fru8IkuDp_k,OMG THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Motherless AÃàteritsiputeritsipuolilautatsijaÃànkaÃà
Fru8IkuDp_k,Chalky White and Gyp Rosetti from Boardwalk Empire. Hell fucking yes!!! And of course my boy Tyler Durden
Fru8IkuDp_k,"R.I.P.  FDNY Firefighter  Michael Davidson
He died fighting  a blaze during the filming  of this movie."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed Norton is an outstanding actor and this looks great!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"They filmed this on my street in Harlem early last year - I watched them film the scene in the car 0:40 in while sitting on my bed with the window open about 10 feet away from the car. I could hear them chatting between takes. I got some good photos, but I think they edited me out of the final cut :-)"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Forget Joker
This looks like a mind fuck"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hopefully they‚Äôll be eating the sandwiches like in the book
Fru8IkuDp_k,OCD Gang Represent! and let's chat and make frensss lol xo
Fru8IkuDp_k,He played this before in a score..
Fru8IkuDp_k,Joaquin Phoenix going to lose to this actor ...again üòÅ
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks amazing
Fru8IkuDp_k,"#ReleaseTheSnyderCut 
#ManOfSteel2 
#HenryCavillisSuperman"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I see another beautiful mind
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Look any other actor, audiences would laugh at him going ""full retard"" Any other director people would laugh at the movie but Edward Norton found the perfect tone and balance for people to take this seriously."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Incredible cast
Fru8IkuDp_k,Gahhhhhhh! Wanna see so bad
Fru8IkuDp_k,*huh*
Fru8IkuDp_k,So glad to see Edward Norton again.  One of my favorite actors.
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks pretty good.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed Norton is just a great actor. This appears to be a better performance then the joker
Fru8IkuDp_k,I really like the cinematography in this. Very nice.
Fru8IkuDp_k,They finally made it ?!?! üòÄ
Fru8IkuDp_k,Who is here after nyt interview?
Fru8IkuDp_k,damn bobby carnivalle or whatever his name is really plays a cop in every movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,Wait there's Tourette syndrome and next moment it disappeared? It's not a cancer to be recovered.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward can¬¥t run worth a damn. Like William Shatner
Fru8IkuDp_k,this looks kind of awful.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Had Lethem sign my book a couple years ago after seeing him on a panel re: creativity. I immediately devoured the book's chapters and knew it'd be a film one day. This is thrilling!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Nothing could make me happier than seeing this guy back.. An actor like no other... Incredible Norton
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton such a great actor. Funny as hell too....on SNL.‚ò∫Ô∏è
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Ahhhh nuts, you lost  me with Baldwin"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Those tics are very relatable, thats why I don't really want to watch the movie because it reminds me constantly of my 'disease'"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Thats why I don't see trailers, now we know Bruce is dead"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Touch it Bailey !
Fru8IkuDp_k,It looks amazing. Really excited and glad that Norton is back
Fru8IkuDp_k,Wow I cant wait to see this movie!
Fru8IkuDp_k,anyone knows the name for this music ?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Trust me touretters, u won't wanna watch this. The very nature of tourette itself, u wun want to spark it again"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Loved the book. I like the noir restaging but the expanded ‚Äúlove interest‚Äù is a tired cliche the premise doesn‚Äôt need. Is Norton looking at this project as his ‚ÄúRainman‚Äù
Fru8IkuDp_k,I watch this trailer Every. Single. Day.
Fru8IkuDp_k,This trailer is one of  my favorite movies.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Wow, glad to see Edward Norton finally got this movie off the ground. It's been in production since forever."
Fru8IkuDp_k,this looks really intresting
Fru8IkuDp_k,looks dogshit
Fru8IkuDp_k,Going to see this one............NOT
Fru8IkuDp_k,Is this a Boardwalk Empire movie?
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks stupid.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks like a snore fest, like Live By Night, or The Black Dahlia. This is coming from a staunch noir fan, my favorite genre. But I get a similar vibe here. The one where you wake up or are frustrated by how disappointed you were come the credits."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"When I first saw this trailer, I thought it was a Fight Club 2 trailer"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Based on the great novel by Jonathan Lethem. Already see some significant changes in setting and plot, but that‚Äôs okay. Excited to see Norton‚Äôs interpretation of Lethem‚Äôs great work."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I thought it was Kevin Spacey in the thumbnail.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks like it's going to be a classic
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hulk Edward Norton
Fru8IkuDp_k,Finally! Edward is a true genius. Hopefully he‚Äôll get an oscar for this role!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I adore the book, so I was really looking forward to seeing this. Why the hell did they decide to set it in the 50s?

I'm skeptical."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I have waited for Ed
Fru8IkuDp_k,I'm watching
Fru8IkuDp_k,I wan t this movie in the poland in 2019 No 2020
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton went full Tourette‚Äôs...
Fru8IkuDp_k,"So did they replace the fujisake, and the monks with politicians? Btw, Ed Norton is a magnificent Essrog. I think I pictured him as Essrog bf I heard of this movie. Hope it's good. I loved Essrog in the book (he has a special place in my heart - that freaküòò)"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks great. Just remember: 

Never go full retard!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,The music in this trailer is so beautiful and haunting
Fru8IkuDp_k,Derek and Seth back together lol
Fru8IkuDp_k,I see Edward Norton..I don't think twice..‚ô•Ô∏èüî•
Fru8IkuDp_k,Best Bruce Banner. A shame he was seen as too difficult to work with. Looking forward to this movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,Love this movie. Gonna watch this with my brother.
Fru8IkuDp_k,What kind of trailer is this we already saw every death
Fru8IkuDp_k,"The ""NARRATOR"" is back! This looks great, but man, Willem Dafoe looks even better. He's the kind of guy that doesn't seem to age. He looks the same as in Platoon 33 years ago."
Fru8IkuDp_k,He gonna win a Oscar
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Really wish they didn't show Frank's death in the trailer, but I guess they had to in order to further explain the plot. Either way, I really can't wait for this movie! (edit) -> This cast is fucking stacked as well."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"poor Ethan Suplee, no mention in the credit cards yet you know he was brought in for some American History X nostalgia. At least he mentioned in the Youtube description but for Wolf of Wall Street witch he was seriously underused. I would have went with Mallrats, My name is Earl or boy meets world personally. Still will watch just to here Edward Norton Narrate again.

Overall Trailer¬†review¬†6 out of 5 stars."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I thought Omar was killed in The Wire?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I like Norton's acting.I read an article saying he pokes his nose unnecessarily into direction and changes script on the set, and many people don't wanna work with him for these reasons. If it's true, i hope he stops doing that (unless its his own directorial movie), so i can watch him on screen more often."
Fru8IkuDp_k,The making of this movie got a New York City firefighter killed. Look it up.
Fru8IkuDp_k,How long until the tourettes people out in the world start bitching and moaning in this 21st century PC world we live in
Fru8IkuDp_k,Damn his performance is scary me out.
Fru8IkuDp_k,just give this man Oscar already!!! he got robbed many times
Fru8IkuDp_k,Another Academy Award coming straight at Edward ^__^
Fru8IkuDp_k,looks really bad
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I am actually going to the movies for this, because of the song made by Thom Yorke. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't have heard about this movie at all."
Fru8IkuDp_k,You guys below just made me realize there will probably be some tourettes folks in the theater.  That should be interesting.....
Fru8IkuDp_k,The Sixth Sense + Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
Fru8IkuDp_k,"What an amazing cast.. I gotta see this. Also, OMAR LITTLE."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I want this to be good but red flags keep going off in front of me. I hope Norton sticks the landing.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Thom Yorke - period.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Alec Baldwin, and Willem fkin Defoe. Holy shit that is a cast. Just take my money, take IT!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ooh this is interesting! I wanna see it and the story is so interesting:)
Fru8IkuDp_k,Wow!!! Another Woke Movie in 2019.... boy I can't wait.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Exactly like his character in ""The Score"""
Fru8IkuDp_k,I wish Ed stayed as the Hulk for the rest of the MCU.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"agh now they can't include the detail about how listening to Prince calms Lionel, cuz Prince wasn't around in the 50's!!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Bro I need to SEE THIS!!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,At the start of this trailer I thought I was in for a comedy
Fru8IkuDp_k,2:21 That last shot with the foggy Brooklyn bridge looked beautiful
Fru8IkuDp_k,Derek Vinyard and Seth Ryan back at it again!!! You know this is going to be big!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,This film and Joker look like the two best films of the year. Congratulations Warner Bros.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"No one:
Edward Norton:If if ifü§£"
Fru8IkuDp_k,damn it Norton is best
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Fight club
Edward norten the underrated actor  deserve more"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Why do I love films like these? Suits, fedoras, trench coats, booze, a private detective with flaws. God, I love noir. I have even written a few noir novellas myself"
Fru8IkuDp_k,i'm here because of thom yorke
Fru8IkuDp_k,Was missing ed nortan..
Fru8IkuDp_k,What does this man have to do to win an oscar
Fru8IkuDp_k,Warner Bros on üî•... Gonna win Oscar for any of their work...
Fru8IkuDp_k,Upcoming oscar battle:  Phoenix vs Norton vs De Caprio
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Dude, I have literally never seen anyone try to portray this on-screen at all.
As someone who has dealt with it my entire life, it's refreshing. 
They even got the whole thought based aspect of it, with reoccurring thoughts and ideas. That's like how 90% of it works for most of us."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Jacks real name is rainman now.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I smell oscar...atleast one Ed
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edwar Norton doing a smart pee wee
Fru8IkuDp_k,another movie where Bruce has a tiny part.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Eddie Norton my dude gonna upset Joaquin for the Oscar with this one!
Fru8IkuDp_k,0:41 literally Filthy Frank
Fru8IkuDp_k,Filthy Frank The Movie

Fru8IkuDp_k,Not gonna lie this really just seems like an Oscar bait movie.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Tourettes: The Movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Is this his character from snl, the accountant one?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Give me all the Radiohead!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Man, when The Oscar Gonna Get ""Edward Norton"" 
This man is a fuckin' treasure"
Fru8IkuDp_k,This is actually my name what
Fru8IkuDp_k,Only Edward Norton can go full retard and make it work.
Fru8IkuDp_k,He went full retard
Fru8IkuDp_k,"If Bruce Willis got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role, that would be crazy"
Fru8IkuDp_k,*Can you stop fucking giving away so much in the trailers? Thanks.*
Fru8IkuDp_k,"That cast and score is enough to make me see this one.  Also, the fact that it's written for the screen and directed by, Edward Norton.  He's always been a favorite of mine.  Looking forward to this one.  And that cast...."
Fru8IkuDp_k,""" Touch it bailey "" lmao"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Just saw this at Telluride, it‚Äôs a must see!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"the book of Lethem was a real fun, I loved it. I'll watch the movie for sure"

Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton never left he just took a vacation
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks incredible. I can‚Äôt wait.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Subtext: Even mentally disabled men can be white saviors too! Reality: This was the McCarthyite world of New York in which Donald Trump's father made his millions keeping black folks in slums or out of white majority properties. There were no white gangsters and/or men with Tourettes challenging that reality. This is the so-called liberal lens which lies about the past. It won't be getting my money.
Fru8IkuDp_k,It‚Äôs really cute when he says ‚Äú frank Franky Frankiefranko
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Wow, we are blessed to have this movie and Joker from Warner Brothers."
Fru8IkuDp_k,God damn this is well put together
Fru8IkuDp_k,Wow what a cast. Im even surprised to see Bruce back

Fru8IkuDp_k,"When I saw this trailer for the first time I thought it was a David Fincher's film. From the cool color pallattes to the extreme close ups. Classic Fincher's Trademarks, excellent job on the film Edward, looks amazing I know it will be a huge success. And will you be at the Toronto International Film Festival  this year?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"As an Emmy nominated editor for NBC network during my career..I know the difference between a ""good"" and a ""GREAT"" trailer..this  is GREAT.  Congrats to who put this together..I'll be paying for my tickets and popcorn on Nov 1..movie looks amazing...Edward Norton..whew!"

Fru8IkuDp_k,"My fianc√© has mild Tourette‚Äôs, I have severe OCD. I feel like this character‚Äôs symptoms will pretty much be our future child :( Lookin like an actually accurate depiction of Tourette‚Äôs, though. Good job, WB."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I want to Hug this movie, it looks like an adorable hero of autism, too bad they push the angle that black chicks are only good enough for retarded white guys and/or that white guys should bang black chicks, that aint good for ether the guy or the girl in terms of supporting their national integrity."

Fru8IkuDp_k,"Now this is art. Well done, WB. Looking forward to the movie!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Nice!

Fru8IkuDp_k,"oh. my. god. Ed is back!!!!!  I HAVE to go see this  plus, it looks really good."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton is the perfect New Yorker.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I wanna watch this so bad!!!I'm so excited it makes me feel bad for him like I wanna give him a hug but I know it's a movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks good but you get the feeling this trailer gives away the entire film
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I'm really glad Norton is back, i always thought he had a lot of potential

But honestly, i'd really like to see him all yoked out again, with a goatee, like in American History X, all intimidating and shit.."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Goddamn, this cast is filled with real A listers, definitely going to see this."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Lol do you have a match?

This looks outstanding. Was missing Edward Norton and here he comes back, better than ever.
The cast is perfect. The story looks amazing. I have goosebumps for this one."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Dickweed!
Fru8IkuDp_k,The book had me laughing so hard I was nearly in tears on almost every page. The movie looks a lot more serious but still very good!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Plot twist : Frank is actually just his alter ego the whole time

Fru8IkuDp_k,"I have Tourette‚Äôs, and when I saw this in an ad, my eyes went wide. I was preparing to see a movie just about Tourette‚Äôs and I didn‚Äôt know how I felt about that. As the trailer went on, I got increasingly excited as I saw that it was just a layer to his character. I think that this movie understands that we are not just our diagnoses and that we have personalities outside of our tics."
Fru8IkuDp_k,0:13 touch it billy !!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,I will definitely watch it because of Edward Norton after a long time. My favorite actor.

Fru8IkuDp_k,the soundtrack
Fru8IkuDp_k,i want to see this so bad
Fru8IkuDp_k,Am I the only one who is getting Fight Club vibes or is it because of return of Edward Norton ?!?
Fru8IkuDp_k,And the Oscar finally goes to Edward Norton!!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,So Ed Norton meets the cast of Boardwalk Empire... I'm in!
Fru8IkuDp_k,This was one of the few ads that I didn‚Äôt skip. Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,Finally some not super power movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Do you know how hard it is to watch this with Tourette‚Äôs syndrome!!!!! Ahhhhhh

I get a tic like every second üòÇ"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Calling it... She doesn't know that the mafia king is he father.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I have seen this ad 1000 times now
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Four of my favourite actors in the same film. It's like that new DeNiro, Pescei, and Pacino film."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"For anyone who wants to know:
His character has Tourette‚Äôs Syndrome. It is a neurological condition where the brain sends false or inappropriate signals to to the body. It means uncontrollable tics. I won‚Äôt say I know them all since I don‚Äôt. Everyone with Tourette‚Äôs is different and have different triggers. Mainly triggers come from nervous, anxious, excited, and any emotion except calmness. Talking about it to a person with it can sometimes trigger them. -Please no hate or saying I‚Äôm wrong because like I said it is different for everyone! I‚Äôm just going off on my personal experience with it and I love educating people over it! If anyone has questions feel free to ask!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"A modern noir with an all star cast AND an accurate representation of mental illness!? God damn, this is gonna be great."
Fru8IkuDp_k,He's Back!
Fru8IkuDp_k,He is not going full retard. I smell Academy Award.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Great to see Norton back , one of the best actors in Hollywood"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks original & deep - great cast.
Bobby Cannavale - last seen on HBOs Boardwalk Empire ‚≠ê.

But another waste of Bruce Willis, really? Early-death-role! He deserves another big shot soon."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Love this want to see this
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I absolutely have to see this, just based on the cast alone. Not usually my type of movie but this looks good"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"You don‚Äôt know how excited I am for this movie. I only know one other person like me. It‚Äôs very isolating being a young person with Tourette‚Äôs and only having one person that you‚Äôre not even close with have it. I‚Äôm so happy to have a movie that doesn‚Äôt show Tourette‚Äôs as a joke. I‚Äôm glad it shows the main character as a human being, like me. I‚Äôm so excited to see this"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I will proudly be twitching through this entire movie!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome when I was 14. I very much approve of this, it is about time we got a movie like this. For more people to understand it, to not judge it, to not make constand jokes about it. I was bullied and ridiculed in highschool and even after I graduated. People didn't understand me and my tics and still don't.  The struggles that we face are much greater then people know, it's an everyday struggle. I can't wait to see this movie, and the change it will hopefully bring about how people view this disorder."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Norton's been trying to get this made for a decade, good on you"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I am getting The Singing Detective vibes

Fru8IkuDp_k,It could be fantastic but it could be disappointing. It looks good. I'm going to watch it
Fru8IkuDp_k,"It's good to see my disability put into the limelight but why not hire actors with lived experience, Warner Bros? There's plenty out there, I don't for a second think it's because of a lack of an actor fitting the profile you're wanting for the role of a detective or skill required. Bit of a missed opportunity in my eyes."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"God damn, Edward Norton is back!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks like promising story.. i will watch this üëçüèº
Fru8IkuDp_k,Cool
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Is it just me, or are there a lot of good movies that are going to come out"

Fru8IkuDp_k,Joker trailer 2
Fru8IkuDp_k,That's my block!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was so cool looking out my window at these guys filming. I thought this trailer was never coming out. It was like two years ago when they were over here. So I'm definitely going to go see this.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hype for the actors
Fru8IkuDp_k,Is that a surreptitious effigy of Trump being lynched at 1:39 ? Sure looks like it. Sad leftwing Hollywood wankers just can‚Äôt go five minutes without making some kind of Anti-Trump reference. It figures though; Alec Baldwin is a major sufferer of TDS.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Fuck this trailer burn the movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,I didn't pay attention to the trailer cause i was too busy trying to listen to daily battles in the background
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hell yes i love his movies.. i loved him in twister lol oldie but a goodie then you have bruce willis and tuna from blow. Baldwin and william.. and so on omg i cant wait

Fru8IkuDp_k,A Beautiful Motherless Fight Club Mind.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I f*cking missed Ed Norton
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Having Tourettes was a struggle, the tics he suffers from are the exact same as i had and knowing Edward Norton as the great actor he is i know he will do a good job without making fun of it as many other films do."
Fru8IkuDp_k,WTH??! How am I here?
Fru8IkuDp_k,I am SO glad Edward norton is portraying someone with Tourette‚Äôs and raising awareness for people like myself who live with this disorder
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Alec's great, but he's left a bad fuck'n taste in my mouth. Too bad. Looks like the only movie I'd like to watch."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Bruce Willis, Edward Norton--



Aw yea"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed Norton? Psychiatric Issues? SOLD!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"He is bout to sell the SHIT outta his role, cant wait"
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks really freaking good
Fru8IkuDp_k,Can't wait for the PC police to start complaining that they didn't cast a person that actually has Tourettes.
Fru8IkuDp_k,If this movie fails norton betta call brad pitt for a Fight Club 2 for easy money
Fru8IkuDp_k,Came here just to confirm that the song in the background was in face thom York and I was RIGHT (a win for my teenage Radiohead obsession)
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks like a truly cool concept. A detective with tourettes(?) and/or epilepsy(?) trying to understand right from wrong, juggling his intuition, all while investigating a murder with standup actors, in a very different time for America. This looks great."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Just showed the whole god damn movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,That's the guy in Grand Budapest Hotel?
Fru8IkuDp_k,It's impossible that Norton wouldn't deliver in this. That homie is a beast of an actor!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Dude possessed dont watch this movie no weapons formed against me shall prosper......i forge no covenant with workers of iniquity....
Fru8IkuDp_k,i do the same but i don‚Äôt yell
Fru8IkuDp_k,Thom
Fru8IkuDp_k,can we give him an oscar based on the trailer??? ü§£norton is legendary
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks very good I straight up stoped and watched the ad I never do that
Fru8IkuDp_k,2.5 million views but only 716 comments and 7k likes. Somethin fishy
Fru8IkuDp_k,this looks like a masterpiece
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Geeze, this actually got made. I should really reread this book."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Idk why but I can't stop watching this trailer.
Fru8IkuDp_k,‚ÄúNever go full retard‚Äù
Fru8IkuDp_k,lOOKS REALLY GOOD. tHIS COULD BE A TRUERETURN TO FORM FOR Edward nORTAN. I'm rOOTING For it tOO bE.

Fru8IkuDp_k,Is this gonna be released in America?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks like it‚Äôs gonna be good

Fru8IkuDp_k,Rainman goes to Brooklyn. Looks good.
Fru8IkuDp_k,That's one impressive cast!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"About time he came back.
FINALLY....a decent movie...."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I still don‚Äôt get how they got this guy to be a voice actor for Sausage Party.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"YEAH! narrate that story, narrator."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Man just sometimes I really forget how great an actor edward Norton truely is of the goats of this generation by far. this movie looks good looking forward to it üëç
Fru8IkuDp_k,Thought this was a SNL trailer for a fake movie.
Fru8IkuDp_k,When is Godzilla vs Kong
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Sadly this wont get enough recognition in the major awards shows because its not Disney, Marvel or any other mind-numbing drawl that the current generation watches."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I listened to this audiobook(highly recommended) and was totally enthralled by the cast and story.
Imagine a mash-up of Stand By Me and A Bronx Tale with a dash of whodunit a la your favorite whodunit."
Fru8IkuDp_k,This... looks amazing. And what's that song?
Fru8IkuDp_k,this looks brilliant and elegant
Fru8IkuDp_k,Just seen this trailer on a commercial and stopped dead! Can not wait to go and see this movie! It‚Äôs been a long time since a trailer for a movie has caught my attention like this!
Fru8IkuDp_k,the cast is awesome but if Edward Norton doesn't keep that same twitchy energy throughout the whole film imma be mad  .
Fru8IkuDp_k,I should slap my past self for thinking negatively about Norton due to whatever happened with Marvel. This trailer is epic af. Dafoe!!!! Baldwin!!!!! Wtf dude
Fru8IkuDp_k,Never go full retard
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks garbage ,has he apologised for being a top cunt"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"These kinda movies have to comeback! 
And I have been waiting for Edward in a long time! LOOONNNGGG TTTIIIIMMMEEE!!! 
He is so much better than all mcu movies..."
Fru8IkuDp_k,His name is Robert Paulson.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Make Godzilla vs kong
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Not gonna lie, looks like Ed went full retard in this one. 



Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, ""I Am Sam."" Remember? Went full retard, went home empty-handed."
Fru8IkuDp_k,American History X reunion at the beginnig!
Fru8IkuDp_k,I thought detective stories were only on old radio thanks for doing this
Fru8IkuDp_k,Split vibes.

Fru8IkuDp_k,"This is the most authentic, well researched portrayal of Tourette‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever seen in a movie. I‚Äôm so happy that we‚Äôve finally got some good representation that isn‚Äôt just jokes about yelling fuck! I‚Äôm absolutely going to be in the theater opening night, ticcing loud and proud"

Fru8IkuDp_k,When for Godzilla vs King Kong
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Aside from just how good the story from the trailer looks overall, i really like that the trailer seems to be portraying suffering from Tourette‚Äôs syndrome with a great deal of respect and compassion. My cousin has it and i know it‚Äôs crazy to deal with. I haven‚Äôt been excited to see a movie like this in a while. Cant wait!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I've been waiting for this movie for a long time, for years. Does anybody else remember when a building on set caught fire and a firefighter was killed in action?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Good thing he didn‚Äôt go full retard #tropicthunder
Fru8IkuDp_k,Glad to see Ed Norton back on the BIG SCREEN....
Fru8IkuDp_k,I've missed Edward. I missed him a lot. Thank god hes back!
Fru8IkuDp_k,I think this looks great and im interested
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Character has tourette's.

Character does trailer voice over perfectly without a hint of tourette's."
Fru8IkuDp_k,and the oscar goes too...
Fru8IkuDp_k,I usually just skip ads but I couldn‚Äôt  skip this one for some reason. I‚Äôll be watching for sure
Fru8IkuDp_k,Great movie. Looking forward to the trailer.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Radiohead and Tourette‚Äôs? Sure, why not?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Ed Norton pkaying to his strengths in a neo-noir where he actually got Bruce Willis to give a shit about acting again?

Fuck yeah I'm there."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Daaamn Norton! Hope you get the Oscar nom for Actor and/or Director!
Fru8IkuDp_k,I was missing Edward Norton. I am glad he is back!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I thought this trailer was a joke to make fun of Oscar baits, and I kept laughing at the concept, the terrible dialogue and all the stupid clich√©s for its entire duration, until I realized at the very end that this is supposed to be a serious film! It could have easily be part of one of the fake trailers within Tropic Thunder movie!!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Omar comin!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"0:00 im hooked
0:39 im REALLY HOOKED"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Lemme guess. Another 'white people bad, black people victims' movie. riiiight."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks good!  Plus an Ed Norton comeback - what's not to like?
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton is jew??
Fru8IkuDp_k,Anyone else notice that Edward Norton looking more like Kevin Spacey in that phone booth??
Fru8IkuDp_k,I was wondering whenever this was gonna get turned into a movie! (I had the book some odd years ago...)
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward, I can't wait to see you again üíï"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I‚Äôm interested for some reason ‚ô•Ô∏èüî•....{chuckles}
Fru8IkuDp_k,song???
Fru8IkuDp_k,All bow down to the king Edward Norton
Fru8IkuDp_k,With Thom Yorke's music! Fantastic!
Fru8IkuDp_k,It looks wonderful!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"He

Fru8IkuDp_k,Is that Aubry Plaza at 2:17?
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton is a fucking legend
Fru8IkuDp_k,this movie will become a classic
Fru8IkuDp_k,–ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–∏–±—É–¥—å —ç—Ç–æ—Ç —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ—Ç –∫–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫–æ–π
Fru8IkuDp_k,Yeah!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,A lot of good actors in this shit.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I am Jack's tourettes.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Oscar goes to Edward Norton ü§û
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed Norton is a magnificent actor. But this movie looks like garbage and feels like Ed just got all his buddies to tag along. The title is also weird üòÇ still mad respect for him tho
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks retarded.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ohhh I‚Äôm so excited UwU
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks great. Love Norton. I'm expecting Torrettes charities to start moaning any second now. Or social media complaining that they didn't use an actor with torrettes.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"May not seem like much, but having Tourette‚Äôs  myself, Its good to see a movie being released about someone battling with Tourette‚Äôs. Tells a story how he copes and adapts to his life no matter the struggles he goes through."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Very noir...can‚Äôt wait
Fru8IkuDp_k,I'm waiting ...
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I don't think baldloss knows what power is, would of rather seen him wast away making fun of the POTUS on failed modern SNL."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Bobby Cannavale - ""We both got left out in the sun too long, maybe you a little longer""
Michael K. Williams -  ""You just ain't done cooking yet, friend"""
Fru8IkuDp_k,"So after anticipating The Irishman for literally years, Motherless Brooklyn comes out of nowhere and blows it away."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks interesting, but this trailer is way too long"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I am very excited about this movie because of the accurate depiction of Tourette Syndrome and the awareness the Tourette community is receiving!
Fru8IkuDp_k,I'm glad that you still make original films unlike the other studios in hollywood. But you need to remember that your a big studio not a small amateur studio. You also need to focus on making big blockbusters as many as you can to compete to other studios.
Fru8IkuDp_k,I see oscar season is on the horizon
Fru8IkuDp_k,"If Alec Baldwin doesn't says ""good god Norton"" in this movie i'm out"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward Norton.... long wait but I see an Oscar in that boys future thankfully he is back¬†¬† looks like this just may be a really good movie, for a change"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Interesting
Fru8IkuDp_k,Now this looks good
Fru8IkuDp_k,"This one has a hit written all over it in bold capital letters....this movie is missing one guy with him in, this would have gone several notches higher....... Yup Al Pacino!!!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Detective Noir Throwback. I'm in.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"yeah.. glorify the less than 1% of tourette syndrome that has a speech component. Keep the myth going... so people just mock people living with it by just yelling ""fuck"" over and over.
Sometimes it's just a tick..."
Fru8IkuDp_k,This will set my tics of so bad but still gonna watch it! Cant wait
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward doesn't really have Tourettes 
APPROPRIATION"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Thom Yorke brought me here
Fru8IkuDp_k,I have the audio book version on six cassette tapes as a birthday gift in 1997. It's narrated by Steve Buscemi. I've listened to it countless times. I can live with Ed Norton as Lionel ('Freak show') but I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't' cast Buscemi.
Fru8IkuDp_k,This... does not look good
Fru8IkuDp_k,Did anybody else also think they were watching Dustin Hoffman reprising the rain man for about first 30 seconds of the trailer?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Finally something that looks half decent, still trailer gives too much away as usual. You had me at Edward Norton."
Fru8IkuDp_k,A shame Willis has to work with clowns like these guys... Would rather watch a SJW diatribe then #Rainman meets #Dick Tracy.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Let‚Äôs reveal half the movie in the trailer......

Sure!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Sold.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Chalky White and Gyp Rosetti.  Count me in.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed norton finally
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Wow, Bruce Willis actually looks like he‚Äôs trying in this movie. Might have to check it out just for that"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward fucking Norton is back
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Ed Norton, fine actor. Loved Primal Fear!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I love Edward Norton, do I‚Äôll def watch it."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world.  He played the best Hulk movie ever,  American history-x, fight club,  the illusionist,  the Red Dragon and so much more.  I am glad he is back."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Y'all here for Edward Norton. I just saw Cannavale. Yes please.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"That is a hell of cast!
Edward, bruce, william, alec!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,FUCKING GOOSEBUMPS
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Omar coming, more like Oscars coming."
Fru8IkuDp_k,ok i hate trailer ads or any in general but this one i really wanna watch
Fru8IkuDp_k,"So we have Norton, Dafoe, Willis, and Baldwin? I might have to see this"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I just hope Edward Norton didn't go ""full retard"" on this film."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Uh?? What happen to his problem by the end of the trailor.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward Norton's making a comeback, and I could not be more thrilled about it."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I'm glad Hollywood hasn't totally lost its soul.  This movie looks great! Opening release, I'm in.üé¨"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Oh wow this story looks compelling. I will watch come opening day!
Fru8IkuDp_k,One of the finest actors of our time.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Has Edward Norton done Noire before?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Just saw the trailer before a video, one of the few adverts I haven't skipped. This film looks absolutely amazing, and I can't wait to see it!

EDIT: One of the best things I've ever seen. Honest."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Would be good but why did they put that asshole alex Baldwin in it? Shame.
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks very interesting. The Noir style + an eccentric lead = day 1 watch. It also looks like an Oscar worthy film. Motherless Brooklyn and Joker for the Oscars?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"ow, apparently tyler is still in his head.."
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks interesting
Fru8IkuDp_k,This feels like one of these fake trailer at the beginning of Tropic Thunder
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I'm a simple man, I see Edward Norton, I click."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ok
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Started crying watching this trailer. As an adult sufferer of Tourettes, I have spent many years being ostracized, bullied, dismissed, and misunderstood. Up til now my media representation has been as the butt of a joke at best. I am so tired of hearing South Park and What About Bob references, and those tools were used to belittle and marginalize me growing up. Seeing this means the world to me. Seeing this means the world to future kids like me. Knowing that maybe the conversation surrounding this condition can change is so amazing. Christ, hearing a major actor with the same tics as me... god, that means everything. I will be seeing this movie. I hope you will, too."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Mostly  Legends in one movie..
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Torrettes syndrome can be devastating and I find it amazing how people with the it still have very productive lives. This looks like a very complex story within a story possibly finding more stories intertwined in, this looks to be a good movie..."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I hear he doesn't use handheld weapons. He prefers turrets....
Fru8IkuDp_k,"The last 2 minutes of the movie must be great, because all the rest is shown in the trailer."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"that's a dangerious game he is playing. he is one of best actors alive, why would he direct and risk his prestige? let chris nolan (or any good director) direct it and you act, simple and safe."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hopefully Norton's back!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Remind me of fight club. Love it!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Finally a new Edward Norton movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Quality movies are still being made.  Thank God.  No one movie has been made lately just for as, adults. This movie looks promising."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Awesome
Fru8IkuDp_k,What a cast!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Sees Edward Norton.. you had my curiosity

Sees the rest of the cast... *now you have my attention*"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"It's kinda strange that they shifted the time period from the nineties to the forties/fifties... Zen Buddhism played a major role in the plot of the original book, and that was pretty much unheard of in the west before, like, the seventies, or maybe even later. I wonder what they're gonna replace it with. Also, what kind of music will the protagonist be into, since Prince wasn't even born yet. I'm all for playing around with the source but in this case the source is already almost perfect to start with, so let's see if they manage to make something interesting out of it.

Looks okay, though..."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"It's coming out the same weekend as ""Terminator: Dark Fate"", at first I was conflicted which movie I might see first. But comparing with both trailers, Norton has my support. No question, can't wait."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed Norton annoys me.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Please let this be as good as the book!
Fru8IkuDp_k,If Edward Norton is acting and directing you know it's going to be amazing.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton y thom yorke= genialidad
Fru8IkuDp_k,smells like oscar to me..
Fru8IkuDp_k,Having Tourette syndrome I‚Äôm so excited for this!!!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,They need to bring back the art of the ‚Äúnot giving emotional turning points in the movie ‚Äú trailer.. or you know like a synopsis in trailer form.. ffs
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks awesome but damn trailers are so long now its a short movie in itself haha
Fru8IkuDp_k,ü¶Åü¶Åü¶Å BLEZZINGZüí§üí§üí§
Fru8IkuDp_k,Probably win an Oscar for this
Fru8IkuDp_k,Eff!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"nice movie, cool that they decided to upload it here so early!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Love the concept and the actors involved, but the script sounds tightfisted and insufferable and the cinematography is so flat. Maybe just a bad trailer? I'm getting a strong scent of cultural Marxism here which kills all art it touches :/"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Listen Warner bros,when are you going to release a Man of steel 2 sequel with Henry cavilll?Forget what happened with justice league just start of where you were doing really good with the first man of steel.I think the worldwide fans deserve that.Bring back Zack Snyder and his vision.Please Warner bros.Listen to your fans.Besides why do a new Batman movie when you established the Man of steel already ???! Bring back Zack Snyder and the man of steel sequel"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Why this trailer has so poor views ? Why shitty disney, marvel movies have more views ? Why y‚Äôall supporting dumbass movies and not great cinema ? Thank you Warner Bros for keeping the cinema alive and taking risks."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Omg. An ex of mine gave me this book when I was a wee lass and I loved it...  I cannot wait to see this!!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hi HULK
Fru8IkuDp_k,It‚Äôs like fight club and seven had sex and had a baby
Fru8IkuDp_k,I read this book and saw the author Jonathan Lethem talk about it MY SENIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE. Edward Norton was attached in 2000. It took 20 years. I am SO excited
Fru8IkuDp_k,this looks great but this trailer gives away way too much information
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Warner Bros Where's Our 
""Kong vs Godzilla"" 2020 Teaser Trailer"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I don't know if the movie will lack from intensity... Even though looks good and so does Norton's performance
Fru8IkuDp_k,Yo Omar comin! 2:10
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I hear Thom Yorke, I press like"
Fru8IkuDp_k,This is much better than playing Hulk.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"edward, bruce, william and thom yorke? HOLY SHIT MAN"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Its Omar, run..."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I wouldn't be surprised if this is in the same IT universe or so since its basically made by Warner Bros.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I've never seen a portrayal of Tourette's done so accurately and sincerely. He's taken seriously, his tics are realistic, it's paired with OCD symptoms. I mean, I'm amazed. I was bullied so much for my Tourette's, but some of the most hurtful comments were from people telling me that I was lying because my Tourette's wasn't what they had seen in the media, or telling me that I can't hang out with their kid because I'm going to curse. So, having an accurate portrayal means a lot. I can't wait to see it, but am not looking forward to ticcing the entire time"
Fru8IkuDp_k,üòçüëå‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüòéüòéüòéüòòüòòüòòüòò
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks so good üëåüòç
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Gugu Mbatha-Raw is just simply gorgeous. Edward Norton is one of my favorite and then, there is the magnificent Thom Yorke."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edwart Norton obviously won't let DiCaprio to get a second Oscar :)
Fru8IkuDp_k,Reminds me of South park....p**s!!! Donkey b*lls !! Me and my cousin touched winter!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Eh
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Thom's song is so beautiful man, it gave me shivers when it started"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I'm Jack's excited heart rate
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward Norton wrote, directed, and produced this film as well. If it proves to be as good as we all hope, not only could he win Best Actor, he could win Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture all in one night. Only Walt Disney has won four Oscars at a single ceremony, and that was for several cartoons and documentary shorts. Edward Norton has the chance to make history winning four awards for a single film."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"The way he says Frank...


God is that Salamander Man true identity?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks fine to me, finally an ok idea, not Marvel and DC bullshit. No SJW, God bless America."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I love Edward Norton, but this looks terrible."
Fru8IkuDp_k,The cinematography looks terrible. Doesn't look like the film is taking place in the 30s but in the 2010s.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"adapted from Lethem, directed by Norton, and a song or more from Yorke ... hell yeah"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Finally a good old movie üé• like the when cinema wasn‚Äôt only about marvels
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looked good until Alec Baldwin showed up I‚Äôll watch it cause of Gugu
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks like Joaquin Phoenix got competition for his oscar.
Fru8IkuDp_k,As it's 2019. Who's betting people will criticise Edward Norton for playing a man with Tourette's Syndrome rather getting an actor with Tourette's?
Fru8IkuDp_k,I love Nortonüòç
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward is back with a master piece baby!!!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"This is going to be amazing, holy shit! It's got Noir elements as well, I'm on board."
Fru8IkuDp_k,.... and that¬¥s how you kill a film with the trailer!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton!!!!!!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,At 1:01 I think he said ‚ÄúUwU‚Äù
Fru8IkuDp_k,Pass
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Everyone talking about Norton but the rest of this cast is STACKED. Thompson, Baldwin, Willis, Dafoe, Cannavale, Williams"
Fru8IkuDp_k,I m a man of simple taste. I see Ed Norton I click on it.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks like a perfect fall movie....oh my god yes I'm going to see this
Fru8IkuDp_k,warner bros actors up for oscars Joaquin Phoenix and Edward Norton
Fru8IkuDp_k,Everybody talking about Edward Norton. But I'm here for Michael K. Williams!!!!! Also I really wish the female lead was darker skinned and not racially ambiguous üò≤
Fru8IkuDp_k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Fru8IkuDp_k,Damn washed up actor.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"DAMN, must watching, hate love Edward Norton."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Yassss edward norton yasssss
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I just wish it didn't look so glossy. It feels like a stage play with exceptional camera coverage. But other than that, it looks interesting."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I'll see it for Thom.
Fru8IkuDp_k,You had me until I saw Alex Baldwin.. what an absolute degenerate
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward Norton can't make bad movies
CHANGE MY MIND"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward, Bruce and Willem? OMG! My dream came true."
Fru8IkuDp_k,üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Fru8IkuDp_k,Dude still looks the same as he did in fight club
Fru8IkuDp_k,Thom
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward Norton, Bruce Willis & Thom Yorke <3"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Great to see a movie releasing on Kannada Rajyotsava!!!!(November 1)
All the Best"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Thom Yorke
Fru8IkuDp_k,The backdrop of city and vintage style make me feel like it's L.A.Noir game üéÆ but I'm gonna wait for this....
Fru8IkuDp_k,DER HAT TOURETTE LUL
Fru8IkuDp_k,fightclub similer
Fru8IkuDp_k,The cast though üî•üî•
Fru8IkuDp_k,Is it out there or just I think that Edward Norton is one of the best.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Why does it look like a tv show? Something is wrong with the cinematography. Maybe it will be fixed by the time of release.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks nice!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Tenet trailer please!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Again, showing way too much in the trailer. Regret I saw it before watching the movie"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I need more of Edward Norton in my life, thank you."
Fru8IkuDp_k,VAY ANANSKƒ∞ KADROYA BAK
Fru8IkuDp_k,The book was great... I'm sure Ed will do right by the material.
Fru8IkuDp_k,This is the kind of cinema I go to the movies for. Edward Norton seems to hit & never miss. People talk about how he‚Äôs back but I would like to think as an actor he takes his much needed time for the right film.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"When it comes to playing abnormal people, Edward is a master and genius like no one other, and I hope this film will prove this again."
Fru8IkuDp_k,I can smell Oscars from here...
Fru8IkuDp_k,He's done this stuff too many times before
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Audience- We want original movies..
WB- Yes"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Warner Bros surely makes masterpieces.
Plz #releasethesnydercut"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Warner Bros is going to snatch those Oscars next year.
Fru8IkuDp_k,This makes me want to watch The Score again.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed norton is back. Hope he delivers a masterclass.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Exellent! Looks great. Intelligent thriller.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"""OK, bye bye"""
Fru8IkuDp_k,Smells like oscar
Fru8IkuDp_k,Finally something worth waiting for.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"This looks real good! 
I prefer films set in different times to our current one"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Moonrise Reunion!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton makes a better David Banner.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Damn this looks really good
Fru8IkuDp_k,https://youtu.be/xVeq8UGBNwQ watch now
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edwars Norton! ooh fuck yes!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Sweet Anita: The Movie
Fru8IkuDp_k,He is a good narrator
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Norton , Willis, Baldwin, Dafoe & Yorke ..... Just take money right now, warner you are on fire this year"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Very interesting.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Wow the character has some of the same tourettes tics i do. Im looking forward to this.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Omar!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton is one of the consummate actors and film artists. I am so in.
Fru8IkuDp_k,Finally Edward Norton is back!! üôåüèΩüôåüèΩ
Fru8IkuDp_k,Hey Warner Brothers let me just give you ALL OF MY MONEY
Fru8IkuDp_k,Ed F'ing Norton
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton better win an Oscar for this
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks fantastic
Fru8IkuDp_k,"The movie looks great!
Btw where‚Äôs that birds of prey teaser-trailer?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,FINALLY. This is probably one of my all time favorite books.
Fru8IkuDp_k,What doesn't she know!?
Fru8IkuDp_k,Give eddie  an Oscar
Fru8IkuDp_k,"One of my fave actors... This, however, feels like an obvious Oscar bait, no?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Excellent trailer ‚ô•
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks absolutely amazing!
Fru8IkuDp_k,good actors....this one should be good. I think i will see this one !
Fru8IkuDp_k,Why the f**k do I see Chandler?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Oh my god, Ed is back üò≠üò≠‚úäüèª"
Fru8IkuDp_k,This looks interesting and good - fresh take on an old classic !
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Spoiler Alert: It's the prequel of The incredible Hulk, a DC universe movie lol"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Stop killing Bruce Willis. Anyway, THIS LOOKS GREEEEEEEEEEEEAT =D"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Why does the character's problem reminds me so much of Chandler Bing?:(
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Jesus, I haven't been to the theatres in over a year... but I'll make sure I go see this to support Edward Norton!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Looks well made but very slow, this trailer alone felt like it was dragging."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"holy cow, this looks really good"
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Hell yeah, bring back those detective nior films."
Fru8IkuDp_k,The cast is looking nice
Fru8IkuDp_k,It comes out on my birthday
Fru8IkuDp_k,Holy fuck Edward is my fav actor and the movie is coming out on my birthday...coincidence? I think not
Fru8IkuDp_k,I wish closer to an end Norton's character will find out that Willis' character was his alter ego
Fru8IkuDp_k,"If Edward Norton nails his acting on the Tourette, i give him a big gg."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"This film written and directing by Edward Norton and Edward Norton plays too,now I can die in peace"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward is back bitches üî•üòç
Fru8IkuDp_k,Just win that Oscars please
Fru8IkuDp_k,Thom Yorke was not expected but is very welcome
Fru8IkuDp_k,This movie looks AMAZING. I can't wait to see it.
Fru8IkuDp_k,It's weird how his character in this is basically his very own Jackie Teller from The Score. :P
Fru8IkuDp_k,This movie looks good but the editing of this trailer seems a bit choppy.  Example: 1:32 the audio of the cheering just cuts randomly.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"damn it edward norton...ok...ok...i'll watch. you win!!
yummy piece of..."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Oscars to Motherless Brooklyn: Come bitch and take half the awards.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Edward Norton: How many Oscars do we want?
Warner Bros. Pictures: YES!!!!"
Fru8IkuDp_k,Aaaaahhhhh Edward it‚Äôs been sometime man!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton trying to go for that Oscar! He‚Äôs one of the best actors!
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Damn, Eddy, you really do wanna that Oscar, huh?"
Fru8IkuDp_k,What‚Äôs his disorder?
Fru8IkuDp_k,"finally, he is back after fight club & american history x."
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Academy friendly movie with great acting plus a Tom York song? Yep, it'll bomb."
Fru8IkuDp_k,The story teller Edward Norton...This trailer looks like a Masterpiece... And it should be.....üòçüòç
Fru8IkuDp_k,God damn Warner Bros just makes my day. They‚Äôre the best studios currently in 2019. They go that extra budget just so to deliver premium and original content to their fans. Long live WB home of ingenious cinema and film.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Horrible title for what looks like a really good movie! They're starting at a deficit when it comes to advertising this, but hopefully they can overcome it."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Just made a reaction video for this. Looks really good and has a great cast! I believe in you Edward
Fru8IkuDp_k,So he finally made his own movie. Now he can act like a jerk on set as much as he like.

Fru8IkuDp_k,Release the REAL Justice League movie #ReleaseTheSnyderCut
Fru8IkuDp_k,#ReleaseTheSnyderCut @ WB
Fru8IkuDp_k,"I couldn't make it through the trailer without twitching.  I have 'torticollis', which is like tourette's minus the vocal component.  Persons like myself often lose control when seeing someone else losing control.  As much as I love the cast WB had put together, this may be one Edward Norton movie I'll end up having to skip.  Such a shame too.  It is nice, however, to see such conditions making their way onto the big screen and hopefully helping to normalize it in the eyes of the public who often stare and speak under their breath upon seeing conditions such as this up close."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Him blowing out the match was incredible üòÇüòÇ
Fru8IkuDp_k,Edward Norton? I‚Äôm in.

Fru8IkuDp_k,Tourette syndrome.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"This looks great! Finally not a remake of something we have seen. New, fresh is what most  people want."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Never go full....nvm
Fru8IkuDp_k,First shot of Norton Made me think it was connecties te Rainman.... couldnt shake that feeling throughout the trailer..
Fru8IkuDp_k,Okay. Alright.
Fru8IkuDp_k,"At first I thought the trailer was amateurish and a joke, but by the time it ended I was more intrigued about the story."
Fru8IkuDp_k,Looks shit bc Edward Norton
Fru8IkuDp_k,Great
Fru8IkuDp_k,"Jeez, even in a good looking film like this Bruce Willis isn't trying anymore."

Fru8IkuDp_k,Diversity!!!
Fru8IkuDp_k,Why do I feel like this would have been an incredible video game?

Fru8IkuDp_k,*T H O M  Y O R K E*

xlnPHQ3TLX8,This Movie is AWESOME and the Final is Unexpected.     Thumps Up Disney-Pixar.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,For Pete's Sake Guys Coco Is Not A Ripoff Of The Book Of Life.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,yo soy de mexico
xlnPHQ3TLX8,trailer song?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks like a Dreamworks movie.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I came here because of Inigo Pascual feom Philippines who will sing one of the theme.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Na i se this movie 3 times üòÇ iris very good
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Mi mexican:)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Now I want a Disney movie entirely set in Italy
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Soy mexicano y cr√©anme que esta pel√≠cula no tiene nada que ver con el est√©reotipo de ""The book of life"" esta si merece ser llamada un pel√≠cula para M√©xico"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Beautiful visual and amazing music
xlnPHQ3TLX8,0:57 gimme some head! (lol) üòÄ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I am already waiting for COCO 2.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"if u don't know about mexican culture u Will compare  with the book of life, it's totally diferent"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,*ripoff alert*
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BOOK OF LIFE, I already watched it. GIVE IT A CHANCE!! It's AMAZING!!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Rip off of the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The best movie! I love it! ‚ù§Ô∏è
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Basically The Book of Life üòÇ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I‚Äôm Mexican boy and I fall in love with this movie! Thank you so much! üá≤üáΩüéä‚ù§Ô∏è
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Hello Pixar,you guys make some amazing movies but can you not put out so many trailers it ruins the hole movie"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Friends on usa, don't miss this movie!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Book of Life is more for a childrens, more comey than a important message.Coco have a great animation, if you look Miguel Grandma you will note the perfect animation.
They spend 7 years doing this, and as a Mexican I can say I never seen a movie more close to our traditions than this one. 
If you had someone pass out recently like your grandma o any family member, you will cry as child. I dont want to say that is more sadly than Toy Story 3, depends of who is watching, but if you are like me and you miss your Grandma, is impossible to dont love this movie. The message in this movie is more deep and important than in any other pixar movie.
Congrats to pixar!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Beautiful movie!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Amazing Mexican culture
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Pixar, thank you! This movie represents a gift from all M√©xico to the world! once more..."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Miguel looks like Marco Diaz. XD
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Plague!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,it would have been nice to have november 2nd (dia de los muertos).
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I WANT REAL MOVIE TWT
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"At first I thought this was a ripoff of The book of life too, but after seeing Coco I realize how  wrong I was, I'm not going to spoil anything but the story is completely different and in my opinion I loved Coco more than The book of life (Just my opinion). Take those ideas out of your head and give the movie a chance,  I can assure you that it is beautiful and worth it"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I watched this movie a couple of days ago, I cried a couple of times. Probably one of the best animated movies ever"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,IS THE BEST MOVIE OF DISNEY ...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I already saw this movie and it's not a copy of ""the book of life""
I'm from Mexico
It's touching and very beautiful, I hope you can see it"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I saw this movie and is completely different than the book of life, really i cry"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,who came here from roblox.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is the same of The book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Im pretty sure Ernesto De la Cruz is Pedro Infante but Disneyfied
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is a terrible copy of The Book of Life. Soooooo Original D/P >:-L
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Guys. Saying this is a ripoff of Book of Life is like saying that Forza is a ripoff of Mario Kart just because both involve racing.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The best movie I've ever seen.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,most beautiful film ever. It made me cry
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I just watched the movie and it‚Äôs amazing,  I recommend this movie, one of the best movies made by Disney Pixar so far (I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll cry)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is really diferent of the book of life... i see the movie yet and i'm pround of my country and the form they represent all in this movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This was already released in Mexico and it was AMAZING! Stop saying it is the same as The Book of Life if you haven't seen it, you look like a moron."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,For all the people that are saying that this is a copie of the book of life....YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT BOTH MOVIES ARE INSPIRED IN DIA DE MUERTOS AND IT CAN BE 1927374728Q9827363737484929Q922 MOVIES ABOUT THIS CELEBRATION AND THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT HAS TO BE THE SAME STORYüòä thanks
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This movie is not the copie of the book of life...D√≠a de muertos wasnt invented by Guillermo del toro, is a mexican celebration that has a lot of years being celebrated...the story of the movie is not the same üòí.

People have to investigate first before saying things that are not true. üôÉ"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is really Cute! Why isn't coming out so late rather than when the holiday is actually celebrated?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Oh!This movie already a Massive hit
xlnPHQ3TLX8,im grom mexica
xlnPHQ3TLX8,coco(the book of life 2)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks like the second part of book    of Life. Personally I like it.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,2017 guys?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Never design skeletons with eyeballs. It would look so much better without them.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Pixar gave us so much over the last 22 years:

Toys
Bugs
Monsters
Fish
Superheroes 
Automobiles 
Rodents
Robots
Floating houses
Scotland 
Emotions 
Dinosaurs
And now... Skeletons!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,HAHAHAHA ¬†jaw dropping moment at the end LOL
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks so beautiful af
xlnPHQ3TLX8,is it just me or is i kind of like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Does anyone know the producer of the music ???
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This would be me trying to find Walt Disney in the Land of the Ancestors.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I have a dog named Coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this a rip off on the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Marco is that you?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,simply beautiful
xlnPHQ3TLX8,„Åì‚Üë„Åì‚Üì
xlnPHQ3TLX8,the Adventure Of Miguel Rivera :v
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's pretty much the book of life and its sad that the new frozen short is before this movie like they force u to see this movie if u want to see the short
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Coco is stupid! :(
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Bello,ma sono troppo preso da Cars 3!!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The music is stunning...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This will probably receive the following Oscar nominations
- Best Animated Feature
- Best Original Score
- Best Original Screenplay

It may get nominations for
- Best Picture"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Any Super Mario Odyssey Comment's?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Omg!!!! I go to cinema on this film!!!!!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,And theres a lot of papayrus (=30)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BUT I DONT CARE DISNEY IS GREATTT
xlnPHQ3TLX8,LOOKs like book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Why I want to watch this movie:
10% because its a Pixar movie
15% because it is based in Mexico 
75% a xoloitzcuintli is in it"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Pixar: ""What if skeletons had feelings?"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life 2 looks gr8
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The Book of Life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Some one tell me name of this song plz !
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"YEEEESSSS ORIGINAL IP, PIXAR YOU ARE JUST TOO GOOD FOR THE NIHILISTIC MONEY GRABBING REBOOT LOVING ORIGINALY HATING WORLD OF HOLLYWOOD"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Looks Amazing! Soundtrack got me ,so...well,That's enough reason to watch! and look at all those beautiful patterns!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I know this seems similar to book of life, one of my all time favorite movies but I am willing to give it a chance rather than rip it to shreds 3 months before it comes out."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:20
xlnPHQ3TLX8,so excited for CoCo
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This is copying the Book Of Life. The whole concept is the same....In some waysüò∂.  The kids name is Miguel, and the main character In The Book Of Life was named Manolo."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Anyone else getting a Spirited Away vibe from this?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,cof cof book of life cof cof
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Got it so it's The Book of Life but by Disney.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,In theaters in November 22nd 2017
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Hmm where does this film fit in the pixar theory ü§î
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"this infuriates me. ""coco"" is a literal ripoff of the book of life."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,But I bet it's gonna be nicee
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So so much like the book of lifeee
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I love how this mov stands out this characteristic moral value of my M√©xico, the love and the union with the family <3"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this a rippoff of the book of life?????!!!??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This really reminds me of a small animation called Dia de los Muertos
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The book of life?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,hey book of life just not stylized
xlnPHQ3TLX8,am i only one actually excited for this film?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I don't understand what the movie is about. What an awful trailer
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"So frozen movie and coco are comig at the same time??? ........




COOL!!!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,cars 4
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That skeletons are creepy ...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is like the book of life!üòÇ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Doesn't the main kid remind anyone of a smaller Guava Juice?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The design reminds me of Book of life and the boy reminds me of Kubo. This movie seems like it will be really good.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Can everyone shut up about Spirited Away and the Book of Life? Give this movie a chance. Book of Life was kinda towards the romance genre. I don't think Coco will have too much romance in this :/ Spirited away involved spirits from things that aren't alive, like a river. Hell, there was a radish spirit in that film."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"The jaw drop joke was so simple and yet so smart and funny, I look forward to seeing the film!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,OOO DIOS MIOO!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I have a bad feeling this will play more like The Good Dinosaur.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,OMG
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Guys shut up
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"hope will see Super Mario in Coco lol, because in Super Mario Odyssey Mario looks like he's in Mexico and see a lot of skeleton people"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,it's cute. that's all I think of the film so far.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm in love with the Coco, I got it for the low low"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's not the book of life fanbrats
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Book of Life 






anyone"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"From The Creators Of Finding Dory, Inside Out, And Toy Story...But Why Not Cars 3?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Look at the trailers back to back, The Book of Life and this movie share literally zero similarities. Even their Mexican-inspired art doesn't look the same. Not the same story. Not the same characters. Not the same anything."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,All right! My 7 year old who's terrified of death and all things related is going to love this! *sarcasm*
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The dog is a Mexican hairless :)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,mexico day of baed
xlnPHQ3TLX8,XD MY BROTHERS NAME IS MIGUEL
xlnPHQ3TLX8,DISNEY AND PIXAR ARE THE BEST DUO AT MOVIES
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Sad to see that Pixar is so dry for ideas that they Rip Off Book of Life.

RIP Quality."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks like book of life mixed with Kubo and the Two Strings two movies I both loved so heres hoping for this one.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I love this already
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is copycat The book of life.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,0:30 copy of kubo or inspired ???
xlnPHQ3TLX8,what kind of Book of life is this?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This actually looks quite good
xlnPHQ3TLX8,0:04 I saw this in one scene of Cars 3!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,they stole the title‚Äã of the movie from conan O'Brien
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"0:10 Pharah, is that you?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I wonder who voiced Miguel's mom.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks abysmally bad.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Good luck fitting this into the Pixar Theory. This doesn't look like Pixar at all.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"What do u think they will do for music? I hoping they do an original song for it. It's really rare for Pixar to do this. If they do, I had two in mind who might be perfect: Carlos Penavega and Sofia Carson."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Wow. This looks a lot better than I ever imagined when they first announced it.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"oh, its a New trailer of the book of life"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Disney version of Spirited Away?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Let me tell you that I am very impressed with Pixar's investigation. 
The orange leaves are from a flower called Cempaxochitl/Cempas√∫chil.
Dante (the dog) is a extremely rare dog race called Xoloitzcuintle that is only found in M√©xico.
Even the police logo (on the police officer hat at the end) is the exact same logo of the Mexico City PD.
The musician in the previous Trailer is a cameo to a real Mexican musician from the 1950's.
Aaaah! I feel very proud of my beloved country. (M√©xico)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,And I found the western version of spirited away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Everyones want incredibles 2 and I want a bugs life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,who's here from Conan show
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This movie is quite similar to the Movie ""Book of Life"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This reminds me of spirited away!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of life 2 looks great
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Broke: This is Book of life!
Woke: This is Grim Fandango!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Im in love with the CoCo
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm glad Pixar is making this movie, I already have three hairless dogs and two of them are Mexican-hairless just like this dog in the movie! (The other dog I have is Chinese Crested)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,looks INTERESTING !!!!! can't wait for COCO ....... WHERE DOES THE MUSIC COME FROM?  SOUNDS AWESOME
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BOOK OF LIFE PLAGIARISM.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,could the boy be low-key Marco Diaz
xlnPHQ3TLX8,what junk for young people
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Still waiting for Good Dinosaur 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,They reused Gerald on that dog.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Does anyone know the song in this trailer??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,A Grim Fandango movie. Great. :D
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This film looks quite good, considering that it brings us something we've heard of plenty of times, but giving a new twist to it with some really funny jokes and what I consider to be Pixar's best animation yet."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,epic
xlnPHQ3TLX8,And A113 and Cinderella's pumpkin. and the pizza planet truck. and anfew others
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I found the Coco Easter egg in Cars 3 along with the tree in toy story 2 and a bugs life along with BNL from wall-E and the pixar ball along side it! :)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,it's kind of like book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Si si si!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Rip off of Book of Life confirmed.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Soundtrack is similar to Dunkirk
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The trailer description reminds me of Spirited Away... travel to the world of afterlife....
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm much more excited that they announced a Book of Life 2 than this...
Still, it doesn't look as bad as I thought it did. Still prefer TBOL's designs, but I'll give Coco a shot."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Honestly, even though this trailer isn't anything, it's better than other trailers giving away the WHOLE movie."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I think I heard sombra...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Bug Life2?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,wow the orange pathways they are beautiful
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is it the part 2 of ''book of life''
xlnPHQ3TLX8,reminds me of one piece idk y
xlnPHQ3TLX8,these people legit named this movie after my dogs name it's even how u spell it
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:06 FLUFFY!!!!!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Hey everyone just to be clear. you can make more then one movie about a scenario. it's called having a fresh take.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I wanna watch this soooo bad
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Ya guey
xlnPHQ3TLX8,They're all a bunch of bad hombres if you ask me XD jk this looks ok
xlnPHQ3TLX8,YAY BOOK OF LIFE 2!!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So basically this is the book of like 2.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm hyped
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"GUYS!! Listen, there are more Christmas themed movies on Earth than any other genre of film, right? What differentiates them is their plot. The same thing goes for Coco and The Book of Life! They encompass the same Holiday, but not the same story or content by a mile."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,THE CRINGE IS REAL
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This movie was waaay better in 2001, when it was called ""Spirited Away""."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,¬øQuien es Sombra?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm not sure how to feel about this. The animation looks gorgeous and Miguel is adorable, but the acting isn't that great and the jokes and dialogue seem very juvenile."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It does have a big BOOK OF LIFE feeling going, but I will give it a try !"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with CoCo....
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BUILD THE WALL!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks amazing. I hope it will be among Pixar's best.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is it just me or the background score is awfully similar to Dunkirk's ?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Kubo and two strings?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Getting a great Ghibli vibe (Spirited Away) from this just like how Rogue One gave the same vibe as Grave of the Fireflies
xlnPHQ3TLX8,the book of life meets kubo
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It looks cute. I want to see it--but it feels like one of those movies I can wait until Redbox for.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Mix of spirited away and book of life xD
xlnPHQ3TLX8,illegal...the movie....
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's Book of Life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"The people sticking up for Pixar is so funny. They've lost their touch and are now hit or miss. I believe this will be a miss, a derivative, copy-cat miss."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life.  wow you guys can't even make new movies.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,so is this like a rip off of book of life and somewhat spirited away???
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Reaper: "" DIE!! DIIEEEEE!!!!! DIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Am I the only one who is thinking this is awesome music? Where is it from??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,YYYYYYEEEESSSSS
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"+Disney‚Ä¢Pixar I hope your company apolgized to Conan O'Brien for this, Coco is his thing, it's his show's name, his brand, come on guys... Not going to tell a large corporation to not steal or not do immoral things, because that's too much, but at least don't make it obvious or do it to someone who's more obscure. I mean, come on Conan O'Brien is relatively obscure, so some people know about him, but not many. You have to do it to someone obscure, largely obscure, very obscure, extremely obscure, or if you want it to never be noticed, to John Oliver."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I love how that one skeleton's jaw LITERALLY DROPPED to the ground. Nice play on an expression, Pixar"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"To people who say ""The book of life creator support this movie! It's not a bad thing""

Of course they support this movie
I heard creator of the book of life and one of Coco creator are friends so they made this together

And think about it..The book of life studio is not as big as Pixar, so it's a really great opportunity for them to spread that plot, idea worldwide 

But I still think Pixar could at least try to be more original

I think this movie was just to help ""The book of life"" creators..
And that's not a bad thing but..still..."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"obviously, he broke the wall"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I got it for the low low
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Wow, never seen the Spirit World like this! I love the Disney way."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"the woman saying ""please have a safe journey"" at 0:09 has such a familiar voice but I can't put my finger on who she is >:( someone pls help me"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"""I'm in love with the..."""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That Skeleton cop has an insane jaw drop!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This must be a different version of Book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,can't wait
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Where's El chapo
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"What the??
Book of Life??"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This movie will be very similar to Lucasart's graphic adventure game.
Grim Fandango"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,my birthday
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Team Coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"PIXAR IS BACK , BABY!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Spirited Away??? Anybody? Bueller? Bueller???
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm in LOVE WITH THE COCO.....

I'm LOVE WITH THE COCO..."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The dog looks like a crackhead
xlnPHQ3TLX8,im really hyped
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The Svtfoe prequel looks great
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That a munch better trailer then the others don't u think?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Any other LA architecture folks seeing the resemblance between 0:50 and The Bradbury Building?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I was sure I already saw Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,AWW MAN YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE BOOK OF LIFE 2!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Gosh darnit, this looks really good."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,when ever there is a animated movie about death and the underworld it's always Mexicans. like I get it we have Dia de Los Muertos. but come on.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,looking good. could this get above 95% on rotten tomatoes? I think it could.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Why would Disney/Pixar ever need to put ""from the creators of ""? To remind everyone they're Disney/Pixar? üòÇ"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,quick look for sombra clues
xlnPHQ3TLX8,way to steal the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,If Cars 3 had to happen so Coco could¬†happen... I'm ok with that
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie stole Conans name
xlnPHQ3TLX8,it looks like mexican spirited away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Glad to see Pixar finally producing original content again. 
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I don't know whether this was a ripoff of the Book of Life or not, however, the plot is different, just similar worlds"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,My dog's name is Coco; what the heck?!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"there are thousands of movies for other holidays with similar themes to each other (Christmas movies especially) and nobody cares, but when two animation studios both decide to make movies about D√≠a de Los Muertos, everybody freaks out

Personally, I'm really excited to see this movie, I don't think it looks like a ""ripoff"" at all. Knowing Pixar, it might even be better than The Book of Life! (my opinion, just clarifying)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,MIGUEL LOOKS JUST LIKE RILEY FROM INSIDE OUT
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Main character looks a bit bland. His personality also seems bland, but it's a trailer. Premis is okay. Color and setting is pretty good.

But... it doesn't seem all too interesting because I'm not emotionally invested.

Argue with me, please."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I don't like sand.


oops wrong film"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I like my coco with marshmallows.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I like how the selling point of this film is hispanic culture. Hispanic people are very special people, and I'm glad this movie is about them."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks boring.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I think that this is a book of life rip off and so, like everyone else who shares my ideas should, I will not see this movie and move on. ‚úå"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm really worried because this trailer had barely any views. Good dinosaur flop again?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Amazing !!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is such a book of life rip off!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Now everybody forgot that a few years ago Disney tried to ""Copy Right"" the ancient tradition of the ""D√≠a de muertos"" because of this movie. For me this is more closer to cultural appropiation instead a tribute to the pre-hispanic tradition."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Just like the Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,more like Book Of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,They both play guitar they both find there family
xlnPHQ3TLX8,You stole this from the book of life Pixar
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I' mean it's alright but come on  not the best Pixar movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Since Disney owns LucasArts now, I'm keeping an eye out for Grim Fandango cameos."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why do people want to see a movie that is just like The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,A Great Idea for a movie !
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks interesting.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"What doesn't matter, is that this movie is heavily inspired by The Book of Life. What does matter, is that it looks to be worse than The Book of Life. If you are gonna do something off, you better do what the other people did substantially better than they did. And considering how The Book of Life was unique in both its storytelling and animation, _and_ did its style well, Pixar has better nail this one straight on the head.


(P.S., nice job trying to hide how Coco's father was that famous musician, it's been blatantly obvious since the first trailer released)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Hmm how do u pronounce coco? Co co? Choco? Well I guess it doesn't matter! But the movie looks pretty worth watching
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"lol who else expected star wars music to start playing? no, just me?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Anybody else think disney is copyin g the Book of Life?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,they should of called it book of life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,IM IN LOVE WITH THE COCO!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"One of my ancestors is Hellen Keller, and you said every year they come and *see* you."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pretty background designs!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So Book of Life + Monsters Inc?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"D'ya figure Disney-Pixar made a movie that centres around Mexican culture because of the current political climate? I think, if so, it's very honourable."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,saludos desde M√©xico me gusta como  est√°n representando  el d√≠a de muertos con las catrinas ya las flores de sempasucil
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book f life ripoff
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:20 when you forget to do your homework and your at school
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is kinda like Kubo.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm extremely excited about this film!!! It was about time that Pixar made a movie about Mexico, yeah I know that ""D√≠a de Muertos"" has been already portrayed in the Book of life film but the way it is presented here and the way it is portrayed in the previously mentioned film are somewhat different, as well as the whole ""why I got into the world if the death"" reasons, the book of life is a love story and Coco seems to be in a completely different concept, I must also recognize that the backgrounds as the ""Plaza"" and the graveyard are really accurated to the ones we got here in Mexico's small towns.
Pixar always makes great movies and I just can't wait for this one"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,its 90% book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"OK, to everyone critisizing this film, Lee Unkrich pitched the idea in 2010!!! 3 years before there was even a ""Book of Life"" trailer!!!
Context matters in an argument."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Team Coco?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"is anyone going to point out that this movie seems to kinda remind of The Book of Life, you know, that movie that was directed by Guillermo del Toro, which is also about someone that went to the where the deseaced that are remember live and meets his family members while trying to get back to the living world?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Weird or on point movie team selection depends where you from I guess, specially if you know that Disney is one  of the companies that advice president Trump. As usual just ignoring and using other cultures to sell, good job Disney."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,what a load of rubbish!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"hey guys







book of life"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It might be very similar to Book of Life in some ways, but it still looks really cute! üòÄ"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"hmmm taking all the similarities to other movie aside, do they know that coco is a name similar to the boogeyman? (well also the diminutive of Socorro)."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Disney movie about selling white
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I swear to god if this is better than the Book of Life, critics are idiots"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why does that dog have 20 chins?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"i love how if you search for this, the next result down is OT genasis üòÇüòÇ

xlnPHQ3TLX8,Anybody knows the name of the song????
xlnPHQ3TLX8,i'm proud be mexican
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Who else came here to see what people had to say about this movie and the book of life?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,you are no fun anymore
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Trump will be 0%.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm not gonna say Ripoff, i like Book of Life & Coco."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"He estado aprendiendo espa√±ol por cas√≠ seis meses. Mis clases de espa√±ol de colegio me ense√±an el espa√±ol de Espa√±a, pero me gusta el espa√±ol de M√©xico m√°s. No puedo esperar ver este en el cine. Me encanta la cultura de M√©xico mucho."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,teaser is better
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Bruh it's like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I mean I'm a huge Pixar fan, and I understand that Pixar announced the production years ago, but couldn't they have made the plot line different. They knew the book of life was coming out and from what I can tell, its almost the exact same thing. they even have a short grandpa with a mustache"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"this is practically the same thing as""the book of life"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I Wonder how this will fit in the Pixar theory?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Oh no it looks good. I don't want it to be. I really hate that Pixar is turning to magic (Brave) and Spiritism (Coco). I miss the old Pixar
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Guys. This was in production way before The Book of Life came out so it's not ripping it off. Chill and try to enjoy it.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Am I the only one that is disturbed by the skeletons having lips?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Now entering Dorado
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango the movie

xlnPHQ3TLX8,Trump's version of hell
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That last scene was...jaw dropping.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I liked it better when it was called ""The Book Of Life"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,We still wating on dat Mexican princess (an offical Mexican Princess) üòí
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"THIS IS A COPY OF THE ""book of life"" but Disney style"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks really good in my opinion
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Conan O' Brien needs his shares from this movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Wait, so why is it called COCO?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,people revolt from trump by making Mexicans almost everywhere on media
xlnPHQ3TLX8,MY HEART IS READY
xlnPHQ3TLX8,They need to make Grim Fandango a movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,What a beautiful looking movie :D
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm probably gonna bawl at the premiere with all the brown representation. Thank you Pixar. Finally.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,manolo is looking greatüëåüèºüëåüèº
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks really good. I don't often see trailers that actually make me want to watch the movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Nice baphomet logo. Maybe you might want to sacrifice your own kids this week or month or year this time. Sick!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Meanwhile in Mexico.......
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"My jaw dropped too, wow!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar is inspiring hearts as always with these amazing new films!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"*Disney‚Ä¢Pixar*  whats up with the logo?
Satanist much?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,OH IM SO READY FOR THIS RIGHT NOW
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It would be much more breathtaking, if you can use that word, if huge subtitles 'FROM CREATORS OF THIS THIS AND THIS' wouldnt take 90% of screen."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It kinda reminds me of the book of life idk why tho
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is a ripoff of Conan O'brien
xlnPHQ3TLX8,the best part about this comments section is that it is less original than the film that they are claiming is unoriginal.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,rock dog rip off
xlnPHQ3TLX8,100%¬†book of life ripoff
xlnPHQ3TLX8,i wish the book of life had a crossover with this
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango graphical elements from 1:04 ?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Fun fact: Lee Unkrich first pitched the idea for Coco in 2010, when Toy Story 3, which he also directed, was released. 

The Book of Life was originally optioned by DreamWorks Animation in 2007."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,can we get WALL- E 2?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango the movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,could have been a sequel to The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,A movie about child death and spooky scary skeletons whats not to love
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So... Mexican Kubo?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,im so happy they are making a movie based on my peoples culture
xlnPHQ3TLX8,we need to build a wall to keep the ghosts out
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Very Nice...............
xlnPHQ3TLX8,They gotta add this one to the gender and racial list
xlnPHQ3TLX8,kubo and the book of life had a baby
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I feel like this should've been the teaser and the other video the trailer
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"November 22, 1963"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So basically book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Hey look, it's an uglier version of the book of life"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Im 20
And I want to watch this"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the Coco!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Thought this was the sequal to the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,well this looks boring
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Hmmmm Kubo was already made?!?!? The hell is this
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this a sequel to book of like
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:06 he's eating a concha! XD
xlnPHQ3TLX8,We need a Papyrus and Sans Easter egg.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,√â Parecido com festa No c√©u
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"oh boy, another 3D animated movie, rather than Disney actually attempting something interesting and stylized. because you know, it's too expensive to be creative at Disney"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Amazing Book of life Ripoff! I can't wait for it!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,thought the thumbnail was a menstrual cup
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks so polished. Amazing lighting.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,so it kinda like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Hmmm..did they copy the book of life?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,how generic
xlnPHQ3TLX8,basically its part 2 of book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Coco...kinda reminds me of someone who is very funny...oh yeah.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,still waiting for toy story 4
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Its like kubo and the book of life had a baby
xlnPHQ3TLX8,UNTIL NOW..
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Feel like I already watched this movie ü§îü§îü§î
xlnPHQ3TLX8,If nightmare before Christmas and book of life were one movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,at first i was like no but i think it might actually be really good and cute
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"The kid never gets back, too big a wall in the way"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's surprising to see so many people have so little faith in Pixar.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie looks so beautiful
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This feels very similar to that other movie the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The Book of Life was really great
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's the modern book of Life combined with Kubo and the two strings
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Can we at least appreciate how the dogs name was Dante?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Literally just copied the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Disney bought Pixar
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is almost the exact same movie as The Book of Life.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Creepy... I like it.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,where's the chocolate üç´?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Looks deep, can't wait to cry my eyes out, Pixar."

xlnPHQ3TLX8,is this a book of life sequal?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm having a mandela effect moment here. I have SEEN this movie. And not in a book of life rip off way. This is driving me nuts
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Conan O'Brien loaned out his orange COCO trademark to Pixar?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Coco, Did you mean Spirited Away?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is way 2 spooky 4 me
xlnPHQ3TLX8,looks hilarious

xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The similarities with Book of Life are definitely weird. Not like the two movies developed in parallel with each other.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Looks like ""The Book of Life"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Where's Wreck It Ralph 2?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'M SO EXCITED!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Ok I'm not gonna hate. I'll totally give this a chance. But to me, based on the trailer alone, it feels like Dream Works level of quality. Not really Pixar."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life rip off
xlnPHQ3TLX8,waiting for a Disney movie about Islam or Muslims‚úåü§î

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Wait, am I seeing this right? a male protagonist in a Disney/Pixar movie? I can't believe it..."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Wow Disney another orginal movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie is a blatant Book of Life ripoff. Sorry. Not watching it. üôÖ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Finally, a good movie that's banned in China!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So it's Book of Life but less charming?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is literally Book of Life......
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Only Disney can make death kid friendly.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Does anyone Book of Life vibes?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,For team Cocoüí™üèæ. Dislike üëéüèæüëéüèæ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I really liked The Book of Life and I feel like this movie takes away from it's success.

xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life is ummm.... PRETTY similar
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Kubo and the Two Strings and The Book of Life had a baby and out came Coco.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks like another winner from Pixar.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of life ?ü§î
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I thought Coco would be a movie with a black main character
xlnPHQ3TLX8,SOMEONE RECREATE THIS TRAILER BUT WITH SCENES FROM BOOK OF LIFE INSTEAD. DOOO IT!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Why all this fuss about a simple, cringy, cliche pixar movie that will eventually die."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is just a spin off of the book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm in love with the ""COCO""."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Reminds me of ""Book Of Life"" movie"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That score tho
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Looks like Book of Life, which I haven't even seen yet."

every time theres a hispanic in an animated movie, its always a mexican
when was the last time youve seen a cuban or puertorican??"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why does this trailer give me the impression that this movie is going to feel like people trying to illegally cross the Mexican border
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks basic.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,AY QUE MALO
xlnPHQ3TLX8,....so a movie where the Mexicans have to sneak back to mexico?....could just like...walk out through the front door.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I feel like I'm the only one that doesn't know what ""The Book of Life"" is but ""Coco"" looks awesome!"

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"oh cool. the book of life pixar edition.

O R I G I N A L I T Y"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Yay another book of life remake 



All they are doing is making the animation more realistic,and not making it a musical and basically that's all that changed... 

Basically the only kid/family movie that came out with an original plot was The Lego Batman Movie"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,a day after my birthday
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life anyone?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar does know that Mexico isn't just Mestizo right?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks like Pixar is sampling heavily from The Book Of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Better jump on the train just cuz I loved book of life so here goes....*deep inhale*
Book of life = tf2
Coco = Ovcerwatch"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:19 jaw dropping!! XD
xlnPHQ3TLX8,IM IN LOVE WITH THE
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"[totally original Book of Life comment despite the fact I have never seen the Book of Life, have little interest in seeing the Book of Life, and have completely forgot about the Book of Life until now]."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's crazy to compare Pixar first movies to the ones they have now. technology has gotten way better
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BOOK OF LIFE DID IT FIRST
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Interesting concept, amazing animation. A must watch movie"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I need to see a monster house 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this movie looks more spaniard than Mexican. lol
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Well if I'm tearing up at the trailer I better wait until it's available to watch at home.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,0/10 - This has NOTHING to do with Conan O'Brian.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,im in love with the coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"*breathes in heavily*
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks good! Trailer music trying way too hard though.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The Book of Life is shook
xlnPHQ3TLX8,reminds me of spirited away for some reason
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It'll be good
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The music seems a bit much...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,*I'm in love with the COCO*
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Ahhh classic Donald trump propaganda
xlnPHQ3TLX8,build the wall
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar noooooo
xlnPHQ3TLX8,a phone and 3 fidget spinners
xlnPHQ3TLX8,my suspension of disbelief was ruined when you see mexicans declaring something illegal
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie looks boring. I like when Pixar brings creative ideas. This just looks like a sloppy put-together screen play with an overused concept for a plot. Not watching in cinema.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Trina get those Mexican dollars
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"And I'm still here waiting for The Incredibles 2 like -,_,-"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"My little sisters are both half mexican and love their culture. They watch ""Book of Life"" everyday, but my problem is that it's not a good movie. I have no Latin blood but even I could tell it was Americanising what should be an authentic piece of cultural art. Outside of visuals, I have very few good things to say about that movie.
This movie looks like it will truly honor their heritage, and not rely on American celebrities giving stupid fake accents or no accents at all, and pathetic pop songs that really have no place in the world their going for. 
I have faith in Lee Unkrich, and it's really not fair to say this film is a blatant rip off when it could be improving on the ideas ""Book of Life"" had. At least see the movie first before critisizing. This could be like how ""Inside Out"" was ""Herman's Head"" and ""Osmosis Jones"" done right.
I am buying tickets to the premiere and taking both of them, we will be in the best seats in the house and I trust Pixar to treat them like people, or at least better than a certain world leader."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I ahve no idea why but as soon as he played the guitar (sorta) i thought.. ""Kubo and the two strings"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,was anyone else thinking about the book of life when watching this trailer; I definitely can't wait to see coco in theatres.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this about Conan O'Brien's trip to Mexico as a child?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Prefer the style of this to book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Man, seeing this trailer made me realize this is the first time Disney has made a movie starring an Hispanic protagonist. TOOK 'EM LONG ENOUGH! JEEZ!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This isn't The Incredibles 2.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,yo guys i think i saw sombra
xlnPHQ3TLX8,00:10 is it just me or is that Pharah speaking???? :o
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"""Remind me how I know you""



Me at every family reunion."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Mexican skeletons UNITE!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"So, does the guy that works at the entrance only work one day a year, since the spirits can only exit on D√≠a de los Muertos? What about ghosts? Are they"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It Kinda Like The Book Of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Has Tim Burton teamed up with Pixar or something? Because this has got to be the most cryptic story they have ever done. I mean, this is pretty dark, not to mention somewhat disturbing."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This pretty much looks like a better animated version of The Book of Life.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is going to be an easily forgotten movie...like Kubo and The book of life or Bolt or even Undog
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Oms the doggo looks so dorky and lovable UGH I WANT HIM
xlnPHQ3TLX8,so rip off book of life wow people r suppose to rip you off nit the other way around
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"And i thought it's gonna be about a Talk show who got promoted but an old evil man wanted his gig back, the host didn't agree and left."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is just like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I really wasn't excited for Coco until I saw this trailer. Now I'm pumped!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Thought it would just be a Book of Life rip-off but it kind of looks good.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:20 when you find out your mom sees your grades
xlnPHQ3TLX8,what's up with the occult symbol now pixar?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The book of life??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I wonder how this will fit in the Pixar theory
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This trailer triggered my monthly cry
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Why they gotta say The Creators of Finding Dory, Toy Story, Etc: ? As if we don't know who Disney Is! You people don't have to convince us to see this, we're all gonna see it regardless. xD"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie looks boring
xlnPHQ3TLX8,help make this #1 trending
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I cant believe Fluffy is gonna be voicing a character in this movie. this will be great.

xlnPHQ3TLX8,I feel like this movie is gonna be forgotten until it actually comes out
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Honestly though why wouldn't it look like The Book of Life? It was a classic Hispanic animation that will probably pave the way for a lot more movies like that. Come on this is Disney-Pixar I'm sure even the creators of BOL are excited about this lol Doesn't get any better than this bro, also lastly the Hispanic community needs a movie like this üëåüèΩ"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,FINALLY! IT'S NOT ANOTHER SEQUEL!

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm in love with the coco! I got it for the low, low"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I watched this before?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It's sooo rare for a Disney movie to be from Mexico 







I WANNA WATCH IT"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I think i saw soldier 76
xlnPHQ3TLX8,0:09 Someone hacked her way into a Pixar film.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,If it's Disney it's not a Ripoff...just better!

xlnPHQ3TLX8,Interesting
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango flashbacks anyone?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Comparing this to the Book of Life is like comparing the Polar Express to EVERY OTHER CHRISTMAS MOVIE.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Welcome to Dorad-
Whoops wrong game."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this Kubo?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Hey, I think I've seen this before! book of life"

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"No more Mexicans on Disney! They've invaded our countries, we can atleast stop them from invading our Pixar movies. Don't ruin something like this for us, please."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie looks awesome

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Les suena al Libro de la vida? 
POR QUE A MI SI."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this a joke?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks like a great movie to see completely blowed
xlnPHQ3TLX8,just saying this seems kinda lame. is about a dude that turns into a ghost. not original
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Calling it right now, this is going to win next year's Oscar for best animation movie."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Finally Latin culture coming to Pixarüíñ Now Disney needs a Latina Princess! We're still waiting Disney!üèµüíñüíïüëëüò≠

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I just can wait for the next Pixar movie: ""Coldbrew coffee"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Finally I knew once Finding Dory hit Pixar is back to what they use to be
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is the most interesting trailer I've seen in awhile. Also this channels profile picture looks like a dragon ball.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"0:22 Ok, so let's just ASSUME Manolo never went to the Underworld"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,There better be a reference to Grim Fandango in this. It's be great to see Manny Calavera in his travel agency!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I M  SH OOK
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of life remake
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why is everyone saying about cars 3 we don't need another one
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"to the people comparing this to Book of Life:
there's been a million movies that take place on christmas. why can't we have 2 animated movies take place on dia de los muertos?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Pixar always does such a great job at making their¬†animated films¬†fun for adults And kids, where as a lot of other animated movies¬†seem to be¬†aimed solely at the latter. Like, when did cartoons and animation become a kid thing, ya know? Idk, maybe its just me?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this a book of life rip off? XD
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,kubo sequal already?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,#JusticeforConan #justiceforteamCoco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,No one cares no no no one cares done done
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Hey look maybe Pixar will have a good movie for the first time since Up. And an original story? Wow this is going to be a treat for sure, enough to hold me over until Incredibles 2 AKA the only sequel anyone wanted"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,HAHAHAH YOU CAN SAY THAT WAS LITERALLY _JAWDROPPING_
xlnPHQ3TLX8,4th animated film nominated for best picture?????? Inside Out & Zootopia were already snubbed the nomination
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Coco looks like bonnie from toy story 3
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Mexicans smoking that coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,""" Im in love with the coco"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,About time Conan got his own movie!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,disney has 888k subs
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is why we need a wall
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Overwatch? Dorado
xlnPHQ3TLX8,He must be trying to find the border.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,hmmmm running out of ideas eh.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie looks so CLEAN!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Desperado looks good.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Y'all, stop comparin' The Book of Life and Coco. Both are great films, and I expect to be crying atleast twice during this film."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,the book of life part 2 looks good
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This could have been in production before book of life so you all know. Also Pixar will obviously take it in a different direction.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Hmmmmm, I feel there there should be a book about this."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This reminds me so much of Kubo and the Two Strings
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this looks like a bad movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Kinda reminds me of spirited away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,TEAM COCO!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this movie about cocaine?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I wonder how this will fit in the Pixar theory.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"welp, I'm not going to see this movie. After seeing The Book of Life, I don't want to see another movie set in the same holiday AGAIN."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This s some copyright on they self
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"By Pixar? 
Sadness: I think this movie will be great. 
Joy: Why? 
Sadness: It's made by Pixar, and the movie is about death. 
Joy: Oh."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is just book of life and spirited away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,basically Spirited Away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,um... no.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,kubo and the book of life had a baby
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is horrible!  please do not take your kids to see this wicked film.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"yall: oMg tHiS iS a BoOk Of lIfE cOpY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111!!!

xlnPHQ3TLX8,Wow i love book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life 2.0
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango reference or I skip
xlnPHQ3TLX8,hasn't this movie already been made
xlnPHQ3TLX8,anti-white white genocide propaganda - white trump supporting inbreds
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I am sooo ready for this movie!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So THAT'S where sombra was
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Reaper's Backstory.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,finally not a sequel
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"why did the ""please have a safe journey"" at the start sound exactly like pharah"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's Disney's The Book Of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is exactly like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"COUGH COUGH, book of life 2"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the COCO
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I wonder if _The Book of Life_ popularized the holiday enough for this movie to be made? If so, I love it even more. :D"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I don't care if this is ripping off ""The Book of Life"". ""Inside Out"" was a rip off of ""Osmosis Jones"" and it was still an amazing movie, even better than ""Osmosis Jones""."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The thumnail looks like a devine diva cup üòÇ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I Agree with the 9,000,000 YouTube Likes, This Movie is going to be the Best Movie I ever Watched at the Regal Cinemas on November 22, 2017.¬† :-D"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango - The Movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks just fabulous..not gonna miss this
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks like a really pretty mix of spirited away, the book of life, and inside-out. 

I'm exitedüòÜ

also ""remind me how I know you..."" ""They're your family!"" : me every time I go to my mother's home country XD."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Nah. I'll just rewatch the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I love Pixar movies but I really miss original animated movies like Lion king or Beauty and the Beast :[
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar lost its magic a long time ago
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Nothing scarier than a Mexican skeleton
xlnPHQ3TLX8,And Pixar has done it again
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Incoming ""OMG THE SKELETONS LOOK LIKE PAPYRUS"" comments."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Uh oh... 400 people read the dislike button as ""dis I like"" üò≥"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,wow looks awesome as allways disniy
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"this reminds me of the book ""Ghost"" and it was by the the same person who made the ""smile"" graphic novel.  I CANNOT wait to see it."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That dog is the comic relief I know it
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Did anyone think of the book of life and that movie where the boy controls water this is 3 string guitar???
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"tbh this movie draws more comparisons to Kubo than the Book of Life, still the animation looks¬† good but the story seems a bit stale and overused. Who knows though."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,eh....
xlnPHQ3TLX8,not as excited but its pixar and i love pixar
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Reminds me to the book of life, but it's a completely different story"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I am Mexican and I do not approve of this.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,possible grim fandango Easter egg???
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Hey Disney turned Grim Fandango, that LucasFilm game into a movie!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,will it have a wall?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Finally Pixar recognizes Mexican culture üëπüëÄ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This movie looks interesting, for sure I wanna see it. üòä
But I wish Disney would stop with depending on CGI a lot. üòì"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The Book of Life remade by Disney
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is it just me or is that kids voice really annoying
xlnPHQ3TLX8,LOL. That jaw drop in the end.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm really getting Spirited Away vibes.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks like the book of life movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"when I saw the thumbnail, I was like, MENSTRUAL CUP!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I was thinking about The Book of Life and that this is a ripoff, and noticed people complaining about people complaining about it.
But honestly, this movie doesn't look impressive."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,isn't this like the book of life anyone!!!????
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Oh hey its kubo and the two strings and book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Mexican people speaking english
Logic 100%"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,THE BOOK OF LIFE DISNEY STYLE
xlnPHQ3TLX8,i literally almost cry when i saw him pick up the petals of cempasuchil
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks pretty good! Cars 3 looks pretty great too! Can't wait to see both! What a year for Disney! Spider-Man: Homecoming, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Thor: Ragnorok, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Cars 3, Coco, Beauty and the Beast, and I think a few more I'm forgetting! Wow! Incredible. Can't wait."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks fantastic! Awesome, now I can forget that The Book of Life ever happened (sorry not sorry)."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Um has anyone scene the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is similar to The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"i don't know about this one, why do i think that. well the book of life tells almost the same story in a different way. hell both of them are set in mexico!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,No need to put a spoiler right in the trailer though 1:09
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Let me guess in a couple of months someone's gonna come up with a lie about something  in the movie and how it threw shade at trump and all the bigots and racists are gonna boycott it which then it makes headlines on fox saying how we should not watch the movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is why we have Pixar!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"So an exact replica of the book of life, For Shame disney! This is a new level of Garbage for the company"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Italian memes from thumbnail
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"As a Mexican I approve this trailer, looks awesome"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm just gonna be upfront and say that the overview plot seems fine but what really sticks out for me is how stunning this movie looks...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is a copy  of  the  book  of  life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Omg! I love the Book Of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the Coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The book of life 2 realistic version
xlnPHQ3TLX8,omg I'm so excited 2 c this!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Compared to all the amazing Pixar movies, I hate to say this looks horrible."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,i sleep
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It seems to be a book of life + Kubo and the two strings ripoff
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"At first before there were any trailers it felt like I was the only one excited for this movie. Now that I've seen what the movie's going to be like, I feel like I'm the only one who's not excited. The tone of the movie feels super basic and the story seems pretty simple. The whole plot is basically ""Get that thing back where it came from or so help me!"". And worst of all... the skeletons have eyeballs!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"They used Mexican Porfirian Architecture, I see."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,There's definitely something else to this movie they are keeping under very tight wraps. They pretty much showed the same trailer to not spoil stuff which is actually great.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,To be honest this doesn't look like a Pixar movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,looks good
xlnPHQ3TLX8,watching this after seeing the emoji movie trailer gives me a little bit of hope inside.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Eh im not interested, sorry pixar."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"So basically Spirited Away, but based on Dia de Los Muertos?

I am so okay with this!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,literally just the book of life but Disney instead
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So basically the book of life again. Nice.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango 2: Human to Declare
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks like a mix of book of life and trollhunters
xlnPHQ3TLX8,:D
xlnPHQ3TLX8,When trumps been antagonizing Mexicans so you gotta get them in a Disney movie asap
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grim Fandango meets Pixar?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Would've been better if the voiceover wasn't so annoying
xlnPHQ3TLX8,in mexico they do not believe that
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Nice. I'm sure they spent millions of money and resources making this movie and hopefully it will have a good story. On the other hand, I am sure in one way or another, it will continue perpetuating the stereotypes about Mexicans and Hispanics that some other races have."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So excited for Book of life 2!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Book of Life?????? Not sure, Not the same story but I saw a guitar, a boy, Mexican vibe, day of life, hmm, ye, seems like book of live remade without several parts."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of life has a better art style
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Raina Telgemier- Ghosts? Anyone feel the similarity?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I haven't even seen the first one
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Here before #1 on trending üòÇüòÇ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm sorry but this looks almost exactly like The Book Of Life, but with a few different elements changed."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The real question is how this ties in with the Pixar Theory
xlnPHQ3TLX8,For some reason I have seen this trailer in the past ü§î
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this like a book of life sequel or rip off
xlnPHQ3TLX8,COPYRIGHT INFIGMENT
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Deathtopia ??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Nice trailer but where is Toy story 4 and The incredibles 2?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,super dumb
xlnPHQ3TLX8,SIKE
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Reminds me of cough cough 





The book of life"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Ripoff of The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks beautiful, I can't wait for it to release. I mean if it's from the people who made Inside Out it's gotta be good."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Gross Mexicans
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'M IN LOVE WITH THE COCO!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So this is a movie based on Conan O'Brien?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Reaper's backstory
xlnPHQ3TLX8,JAW DROPPING 1:19
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"So it is different from book of life
Aight looks neat"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,reminds me of Kubo and the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Ugh. What's next a pixar Muslim film? No thanks. I get enough ""culture"" in the news."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,IM IN LOVE WITH THE COCO
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"ok so i have to vent this out. Coco is not ripping off the book of life. Pixar announced the making of this film years ago. There has been a history of pixar movies and other movies being undoubtedly similar (ants vs a bugs life anyone) In fact, a pixar film called ""Newts"" was cancelled and im pretty sure it had something to do with the fact it was so similar to Rio. I dont personally believe this has ever pixar's fault, and lets face it, of any similar movies pixar's has always been on top. You could see other companies take on the film, like it, see pixars and forget the other one even existed bc their movies are true art at their finest (lets not bring up cars 2). People claim that pixar copies other movies because they come out after the other movie. However, pixar spends an unimaginable amount of time on their films. It might take them months and months to create one scene and then redo it because they thought of something better. If you are a pixar theorist like me, you also know they think things through. Like its crazy the way pixar works if the pixar theory by jon negroni is true. Easter eggs are well arranged as is how the story contributes to the pixar timeline. Now, i liked the book of life, dont get me wrong. Maybe we should enjoy having two wonderful films, even if theyre similar. All im saying is lets keep an open mind about coco and not criticize pixar. üòÄ sorry for writing so much"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BOOK OF LIFE RIPOFF
xlnPHQ3TLX8,He is going to cross the border before his going to cross the after life

xlnPHQ3TLX8,Garbage
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Huh looks like their really trying to cash in on Hispanic population with this one. Predicting Persian based middle eastern focused one next.

xlnPHQ3TLX8,i thought this was a conan animated movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Alg√∫n mexicano por ac√°? Soy la √∫nica? ;-; v:
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this reminds me of the comic 'ghosts'. has anyone else read that??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It looks like the book of life before it was the book of life idk bout this one üòí
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That kid is giving me Marco Diaz from STFOE vibe~~~
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this based on the same story as The Book of Life?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Before anyone starts saying this will be like the Book Of Life. Please give this movie a chance, I say this because the Book of Life had too many Mexican stereotypes at one point or another in the movie. (I still liked it but only because of Maria being a strong Mexican woman). Coco looks like a breath of fresh air that people can see part of our culture without making churro jokes or silly mariachi comic relief. Of course there will be some jokes but not over the top like The Book of Life. SO PLEASE PLEASE give this movie a chance.."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Anti Trump propaganda
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is baisically a remake of kubo
xlnPHQ3TLX8,miss the pre--Disney PIXAR... where everything was logical without the Disney's 'magic'
xlnPHQ3TLX8,very disappointed in Disney and Pixar..... THIS IS¬† A EXACT CLONE OF THE BOOK OF LIFE!!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this reminds me of the book of life.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Advanced education and Society (part-193)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Does take place before or after the wall is built
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So excited to watch this extraordinary journey to an even more extraordinary world
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks good, but I wouldn't see it... sorry..."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is literally The Book of Life!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Dorado.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"These characters really lack the charm and fascination of the Carter Goodrich designs, IMO. Good luck, Pixar."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,El Booko de Life-o.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,7.2/10 too many mexicans
xlnPHQ3TLX8,*Was that a laugh track at **1:19**-**1:21**?!?????? >:c*
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this Book of Life 2?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life meets Spirited Away.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks amazing. Latin-inspired spirited away homage made by Pixar. There's nothing about that description I don't love!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Am I the only one more excited for this movie than Cars 3. Don't get me wrong I am incredibly excited for Cars 3 it's just that this is new especially to Pixar and personally I love the story of Los Dias de los Muertos. Anyone else?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm still wondering why this movie is called Coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Ehhhh
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life 2 looks gr8
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Mexican spirited away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is a D√≠a de Los Muertos version of Spirited Away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"white guitar, an uncle who he wants to be like, that bridge with dog? is anyone else getting really intense dejav√∫"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I can't wait! Pixar comes up with the most amazing stories. I'm getting really strong ""Book of Life"" vibes though."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Well, it's the only representation us Mexicans TRULY have in the Disney franchise, so why not check it out."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Wow book of life remake...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,anyone ever play Grim Fandango? Tim Burton talked about making a film of that. I feel like that would have been way better
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life and kubo cross over    lit
xlnPHQ3TLX8,El peor pelicula que comia pan...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,the book of life copy
xlnPHQ3TLX8,His jaw literally dropped
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I don't really care about this movie or Cars 3, everyone just wants Incredibles 2 to come out, lol."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,ay dios mio- I'm SO SO SO PUMPED YOU GUYSSSS
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks more like the book of life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"people comparing this to other movies while im watching 1:06 like ""hey its Fluffy!"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME?




OF COURSE!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BUILD A WALL AROUND PIXAR!   -Donald Trump
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks good and all, but where is Incredibles 2"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar is out of their prime.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Who else is getting major Book of life vibes from this?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Kubo and the Two Strings?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That's weird I didn't see Conan in this at all
xlnPHQ3TLX8,yeah more cultural apprioation shoved in our faces by disney..
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Well, this doesn't remind me of The Book of Life at all."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I clicked thinking they had made an animated movie about Conan O'brien
xlnPHQ3TLX8,YES
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Too late disney we already have a movie like this
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Love the new content! But please please please, make Incredibles 2 early."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,GRIM FANDANGO!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Who is the guy that narrates this trailer. i swear every narrator from every trailer ever sounds the same.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I feel like this is a re skin of the book of life...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,couldnt you do this in guacamelee?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"As an artist/aspiring concept artist I'm kind of bothered by how they designed all of the skeletons to have eyeballs, hair, and teeth that are on a layer beneath their skulls... am I the only one?
This movie looks decent but Disney and Pixar have been really missing some opportunities in character design in the last few years (look at early concepts for Elsa for example)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Still waiting on the incredibles 2 teaser trailer.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BOOK OF LIFE
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life is preparing their lawsuits
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Only if this movie was real ‚ò∫Ô∏è
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I love the dogs called Dante as a reference to Dante's inferno, which over the garden Wall to inspiration from."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,No one is going to point out the dog is the chupacabra
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is a book of life rip off...ew pixar...just ew
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is just a knock off of the book of life. They dont even try to hide it. In some parts it look exactly the same
xlnPHQ3TLX8,it just a rip off of The Book Of Life. üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
xlnPHQ3TLX8,you cant just copy the book of life and get away with it
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is exactly like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,so its spirited away and book of life...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The Book Of Life 2 is out? Woah.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It's just like the movie ""The book of life"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm crying watching the trailer.. I can't wait!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"People keep saying this is a copy of The Book of Life. But the reality is, Pixar started developing this movie before The Book of Life ever came out."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I saw this movie already, it was called book of life. I love Pixar though I'm gonna see this too."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Man the book of life was such a great movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,not watching this. so sick of the media trying to push the Mexican agenda on us
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Kubo and the Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This gives me such Spirited Away vibes and I'm so excited!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Spirited away 2?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the CoCo.......
xlnPHQ3TLX8,ANNNNNNND its the book of life all over again
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Tears, people."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This seriously looks like the most interesting one
xlnPHQ3TLX8,screw mexican illegal immigrants
xlnPHQ3TLX8,anyone else though this was a conan movie Lol?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,copy of book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"That gag at the end, boy. LOL! I rarely laugh like that. Looking good, Disney/Pixar!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"wait a second, if the doggo has a soul and goes to the other world, does that mean he can go and visit the thousands of live animals that became his meal?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"TBoL minus the romance.
...

meh. (?)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,the book of life ?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Yeah I think I am going to pass on this one and wait for incredibles 2...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This is NOT a Book of Life Rip Off, it just matters when the idea came up in time."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Oh my gosh why did this have to be on my birthday. I hope I forget by then. Whoever likes the movie by the trailer then keep liking it, I just have my own opinion and that is I don't like it that much."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Grimm Fandango: The Movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"To any and everyone arguing about how this is or isn't like The Book of Life:

I was a Lighting and Compositing artist on TBoL and am friends with its director, Jorge.
While I can't speak for him, or any of the other cast and crew of the film, I can say that seeing this trailer makes me excited and proud.

The entire point of Jorge making that film was to share with a larger audience the beauty of a culture that was so important to him.  Disney/Pixar making a film about this subject will only continue that legacy."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Didn't they already make this movie?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm so confused‚òπÔ∏è
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Book of Life anyone? It still looks too similar. What are the differences exactly? No love triangle, and younger protagonist. Most everything else looks the same."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why is it named coco?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar back at it with the feels.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:19 Jaw dropping moment
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This kinda reminds me of Grim Fandango.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm over here pausing the video every 3 seconds looking for Easter Eggs!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I looked in the comments and people already have brought up Papyrus. Please don't do that here
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'M IN LOVE WITH THE COCO!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"wowzer
got the chills"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,where's 76 when we need him?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Please be better than the little dinosaur, Please be better than the little dinosaur, Please be better than the little dinosaur,"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Cocain.........
xlnPHQ3TLX8,kubo-ishh
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I get that this looks great and all but c'mon Pixar, lets see a little bit of that Incredibles 2 action. I've been waiting too long for that movie "
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this should have been the first trailer
xlnPHQ3TLX8,He looks like Manolo's great great great great great great grandson.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Kubo +  Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book Of Life RIP OFF
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Great to see a new Pixar movie with ambition!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So Kubo but Mexican
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Alright, you guys redeemed yourselves. This looks amazing."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,looks pretty good! i wanna see it!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,prolongamente
xlnPHQ3TLX8,prolungamente
xlnPHQ3TLX8,a must watch movie from Pixar
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The part when he played the guitar gave me chills
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That boy was recently deported too!! #MAGA
xlnPHQ3TLX8,BUILD THE WALL.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,meh
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Zootopia + The Book of Life = Coco. Pixar you're losing your touch.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,wow i love the new book of life/Kubo and the two strings sequel
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Go away trump I want to see this movie!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I am crying... this is so beautiful, what is shown on this trailer matches mexican tradition to perfection. Finally a depiction of Day of the Death that is closer to reality. Oh, yes! the tradition has been partially lost on big cities, so it makes sense this takes place on a little town."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Wait, this is a Book of Life ripoff? o.O Ummm... people,¬†just because it's set in Latin American society doesn't mean it's similar. Honestly, I was more thinking the plot sounds very similar to Spirited Away, just with Latinx characters.

And I wouldn't exactly call it a ripoff. Many concepts in Inside Out had already been done before (Osmosis Jones, anyone?), but Inside Out handled the execution of those concepts in a much better way."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,love
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Its kinda has the vibe of Spirted Away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life didn't create this aesthetic people!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Basically the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Should've been directed by Tim Burton
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Okay, that last part made me laugh."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this looks amazing!!!!!!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Nothing sad happened but somehow I started tearing up already.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life pt2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Jaw dropping performance @1:19 üòÇ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I thought the book of life already came out?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The kid in this movie looks like my dad when he was younger! He also loved to play guitar and grew up with musicians like Vicente Fernandez. I can't wait to see this with my parents ^-^
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I guess I saw this a year earlier
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Gonna watch this movie for the Culture üíØ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Donald trumps favorite movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why does this have be released so darn late? This would be better if it'll be released in October
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"""Anything to declare?""
I hate you.
""I get that a lot."""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,ITS MARCO DIAZ PEOPLE
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I hope the music will as good as book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,When was the last time a white kid was the main character ‚Ä¨
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this not the same plot as that one Mexican movie like 2 years ago
xlnPHQ3TLX8,happy to be early soooo beautiful
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The official US version has a wall
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"from the director of Toy Story 3.

I'm in!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I love the idea. I love the characters but... 

This trailer was SO generic. It honestly makes me worry about the movie"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is a exact ripoff of the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Sequel Of The Book Of Life!! üòÅ‚úå
xlnPHQ3TLX8,looks alot like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,seems like Dreamworks won't get the oscar this time as well üòç
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Plz people, stop comparing this to the book of life. I know that was a great movie, and who knows that coco will be ""basically the book of life"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with tha coco.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I stumbled upon Book of Life and enjoyed it. I can't wait for this.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Oh yeah
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I will only see it because its Pixar, cause Pixar does black magic on movies making them amazing."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,so basicaly the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,1:21 now that's what I call jaw dropped
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"one of the extremely few movies, we have a Hispanic main character. definitely going to support this movie. not only just for that but, to support diversity in the movie scene"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It's JAW-DROPPING








I'm not sorry"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"So it's like Del Toro's The Book of Life? I don't get Pixar. The cancelled Newt because it would be too similar to Rio (from Blue Sky Studios), but this movie looks a LOT like The Book of Life.

Still, this movie looks gorgeous, I can't wait to see."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,anyone know the music?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar will find a way to make me get the feels.....like always
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie was announced before the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,*BOOP*
xlnPHQ3TLX8,When Cars 3 isn't even out and Pixar already wants you to forget it exists
xlnPHQ3TLX8,get ready for coco2 in 10 years after this
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This copied The Book of Life I hate this
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Just watch The Book Of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,*Book Of Life Ripoff*
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Sombra better be in this.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,trump will build a huge wall in every cinema this 21 november lol
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar has created some really beautiful and creative movies in the past and this one looks like its going to be special.  It's cool to see Pixar finally stretching out and using human characters of a different ethnic origin too. I predict that the man the little boy looking for is going to be his father....that's why his picture is torn out of the family photo.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why have i already seen this movie?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Welp, now I'm excited."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,wait is this a new.movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,they saw how popular the book of like was and pixar wanted some of that action
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"""La d√≠a de los muertos"" themed movie üòç"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,reapers orgin story
xlnPHQ3TLX8,it's just the book of Life except better
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Huh, I'm getting Robots vibes from this (the film with Robin Williams in it)."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Ripoff of The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm super excited for this movie! It's just... when I first clicked on it I could only think that it was going to be a movie for CoCo from Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Meh
xlnPHQ3TLX8,YES PLEASE
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"At 1:20, my reaction to this trailer"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,We want little white kids and talking cars not Mexicans
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Coco has been in production for years! A lot of you don't realize Dreamworks rushes  production on their films to pump them out faster than Pixar so that they can compete. Even though they released Book of Life first, Pixar started production first. Since they take their time, this will be a much higher quality film. Quality over quantity, not the other way around."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The sun flower from tangled!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"When ever I see this, it makes me want to watch the book of life again and skip this"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"is that pharah's Voice actor saying ""please havea safe journey"" at the beginning?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"he just crossed the border illegally




again"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,All of these comments seem so fake
xlnPHQ3TLX8,**sigh** I guess we'll never get a good original movie out of you guys again
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So Book of Life 2?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The book of life looks good
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Where is Manuel ""Manny"" Calavera?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It seems really cool, good job Pixar;)

i just hope it won't be a copy of ""The book of life""..."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I am 110% I am going to cry.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This movie is original. It is not a ripoff of The Book of Life. Pixar wouldn't do that. Remember when they scrapped Newt because it was too similar to Rio? And they weren't even the same species!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"coco is like the movie,""the book of life"""
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It kinda looks like rock dog, Kubo and the two strings, and the book of life. It looks really cool"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,isn't this like the book of life sort of
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life 2
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why does this look like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,That's 4 days after my b day
xlnPHQ3TLX8,didn't think it looked all that good in the first trailer but now I'm hyped
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why must they always make movies about mexicans. Theyre not the only latinos
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I bet all the undertale fans are excited for more skeletons... :3 Looks good though!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Disney version of Book of Life. üòí
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Love
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"First Disney uses animals, comedy, music to ""teach"" children about the cycle of life then they use this to make death more, uh, interesting, comedic and still fightful to kids?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is so awesome!!!!! üòçüòçüòçüá≤üáΩ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life (HD)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,OMG awesome movie trailer reminds me of the book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So excited  for  this but my first thought was the book of life half expected to see la muerte and the candle maker
xlnPHQ3TLX8,i wish this is connected to Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"build a wall to keep the ""ancestors"" out"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,so excitedüòÉ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks good
xlnPHQ3TLX8,disney is EVIL
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Could've done it without the Mexican overtones
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So excited for this movie!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Didn't this movie come out already?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"half the comment section is people saying its not book of life


help"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,that spirited away reference was not lost on me
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Illegally crossing borders, very Mexican. Excited for this~"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I wish the narrator had an accent. It would add some better immersion. But the movie looks so beautiful üíï
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Traslocator ready

I might need this later

Dyonda 

Emp activated 

Sombra online."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm so happy for Pixar this is trending!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Would rather see it made by Tim Burton
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Not feelin' it...I don't know why, but I'm not feelin' it.."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Meh
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Dia de la muerte is the most interesting holiday to me. To treat the biggest fear to humanity as a celebration is fascinating.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks like Dorado the movie version
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Ok
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"WHAT IF *Picks out of the bag* ""Skeletons"" had feelings. Alright people the bag has spoken, start writing the script!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The visiting and sharing of a drink literally made me tear up.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,But it's so similar to The Book of Life!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This movie is going to destroy me emotionally, I can already tell"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This is similar to the ""Book of Life"" movie!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Will definitely wathing this!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'M IN LOVE WITH THE.....
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Mexican spirited away
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Is this the sequel to that Book of Life movie? It honestly looks way too similar
xlnPHQ3TLX8,ripeoff of book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Trump trump trump
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The music is amazing!!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Disney is my life! But But is to similar to the book of life... I can't
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why are they making a video about team coco??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Looks great! Can't wait to see this
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Why is the movie even called coco?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Jaw dropping good!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Blue Sky is making an adaptation of a book from Spain (not Mexico) about bull. It's gonna get less than Coco due to box office. I bet a toe-nail that Coco will be the highest grossing film about Latinoes.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of life 2.... wait no... coco?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"WHERE IS MY INCREDIBLES 2!?!?!?!?!?!?

also that generic crowd gasp i heard in EVERY single trailer is in here (in the ending) *barfs*"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Can we stop comparing this with the book of life and just be happy that we are getting another movie that celebrates Mexican culture?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Another find way back home Pixar movie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,that last scene is jaw dropping üòÇ
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Man, Book of Life 2 looks great!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Eh looks okay
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Im so excited and idk why
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"this looks beautiful, the CG work really shows, glad that Del Toro is still making movies about Mexico, The book of Life was really good but it just wasn't as visually appealing as I would like it to have been. The book of Life looks great it's just I wasn't the biggest fan of the puppet approach they had but still a great Del Toro film"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Grim Fandango in reverse, the film :)"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,is it just me or does the art at 0:48 low key remind you of some of Hayao Miyazaki's work in studio ghibil?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Well, now I feel like playing overwatch again"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,awesome üòá
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I CANT WAIT üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"so........they're trying to......smuggle the kid back to the land of living? wow, these mexican is taking cross country way too far, now it's a cross dimension! LOVE IT!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,im gonna see it but its like the book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Simple GSU!! 
Awaitin 4 2nd trailer.."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,i can't wait for this movie to come out
xlnPHQ3TLX8,book of life????
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Will there be a cameo of Manny Calavera?

xlnPHQ3TLX8,my first reaction... He strums a guitar and magic burst forth and blows wind and leaves.  umm Kubo is that you?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"If there are any cameos or references to Grim Fandango, I will die of joy."

xlnPHQ3TLX8,Thi I exactly like to book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Does anyone find it Very Interesting that a Living Person is witnessing the Ancestors World? i sure think so its like going to Heaven but your actually Alive still and seeing everyone in your Family you never got to meet in person.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"And that's what makes it so Interesting & Exciting to watch XD, 0:16"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Well actually that's not bad. It's a brand new concept I guess.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks fabulous - I love the art and the colors - and I can't wait, but right now my favorite detail is that the dog is named Dante. Very appropriate for a movie about journeying through the afterlife. ;-)"

xlnPHQ3TLX8,nice book of life ripoff
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Esto Es para nosotros Latinos!!!!!!!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,wait a trailer that doesn't give us the entire movie I'm in shock.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Lets celebrate mi amigos (plays Mexican hat dance at full volume)
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This is more exciting to me than i care to admit
xlnPHQ3TLX8,saying this is a ripoff of the book of life is like saying antz is a ripoff of a bugs life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This movie reminds me of the 2014 film ""The Book Of Life"", but even better. I can't wait to watch it! üòÑüéµüé∂‚ú®üíÄüå∏‚ù§üíûüíñ"

xlnPHQ3TLX8,So it's book of life??
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So... Book of Life and Kubo but by Disney?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,you stole the name from Conan. pay him copyright fees disney
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This trailer seems to show a bit of how beautiful the animation looks!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"It's quirky, it's weird, it's fun. It's Pixar. Let's go. I'ma watch it."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Finally Pixar does a movie for Mexicans. But its basically book of life 2.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Pixar needs to stay with the stories they do best: Toy Story, Cars, Up, Finding Nemo; innocent kids stories. This is not innocent. It's actually dangerous to tell a child that there is something ""beyond"" death (like telling them Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy exist). The Bible repeatedly states death is the end of life; not the beginning."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Reminds me of The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'm excited for both movies. Cars 3 seems like a real emotional packed feature, which looks amazing. Then Coco seems very mystical and traditional. A good mix this year from Pixar."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,There's a lot riding on this. Pixar is up to their neck in sequels. I really hope this can bring it home and turn them back in the direction of original scripts.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life rip-off?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"2 words :
*CANT*
*WAIT*"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,El Chocu
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I don't care what anyone says, I'm super excited for this movie."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,we haven't got a movie like this in soo long
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Pixar's Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So basically The Book of Life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,this is so cool !!! can't wait!!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Coco was in production for a long time, before Book of Life was released. It has different story, but it's in the same place; Pixar will put in references from other movies."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,looks very similar to book of life
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"hm I wonder what this reminds me of? oh yeah, THE BOOK OF LIFE its pretty similar to the book of life not the same concept but pretty close where you can get the idea from it"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,#teamcoco

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Is it just me or is this kind of... meh? I'm a MASSIVE Disney fan, and The next Disney movie I'M actually excited for is the live action version of The Lion King."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,There are 2 Pixar films in 2017: Cars 3 & Coco! Can't wait to watch them both! I am certain that Pixar will win the 2018 Oscar for Best Animated Feature and both will be nominated but only one of them will win!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,His jaw literally dropped XD

xlnPHQ3TLX8,So basically Book of Life?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,TRAVELING TO DORADO
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"For me, it's not about where its story ""may be"" derived from (referring to Book of Life). As long as I enjoy the movie and it grabs my attention, then it's good enough. And if I see myself attached to it watching it more than once, then it's perfect!"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Good News: It's not a sequel!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,The narration in this video reminded me of a early 2000s movie....and I liked it.

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"You're allowed to make more than one movie about the same holiday. I don't hear everyone complaining when new Christmas movies are released each year that they're all identical to the ones that came before them‚Äîprobably because you have enough sense to realize that ""Christmas"" in and of itself is not the plot. Apply that common sense here."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,i hope this flim will get a oscar.

xlnPHQ3TLX8,"What do people honestly expect Pixar to do when they're using the exact same source material as 'The Book Of Life'? It's a similar visual style with similar themes, but guess what - *same source material!*
It's like Atlantis: The Lost Empire mirroring other films that also used the same source material it was derived from, thus reflecting an angular style. That's just how these things go.
Just because you've commented 'Hurdur Pixar's doing the Book Of Life' that doesn't make it true, or indeed an original comment."

Is it really such a bad thing that they might have some similar themes here and there?

xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks better than I expected.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I'm in love with the coco!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So hype
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Rip lighting designer at 0:47
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Here before trending
xlnPHQ3TLX8,the book of life 2 confirmed
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I'll admit this is a bit too reminiscent to The Book of Life, but hopefully Pixar is smart enough to differentiate it enough to make it stand on it's own, can't wait to watch this gorgeous looking film in theatres"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,This looks cool.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Oh boy, I think the Cinema is going to be flooded with tears."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Book of Life looks different than I remember...
xlnPHQ3TLX8,They should just nominate this trailer for Best Animated Feature
xlnPHQ3TLX8,wowie
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Alle 2 di notte?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,Thank you for another diverse movie ‚ù§Ô∏è

xlnPHQ3TLX8,The female skeltons are *THICC*
xlnPHQ3TLX8,It's one of those movies that will be forgotten a year. Kinda like moana. Hopefully cars 3 will be good.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"I find it kinda funny that because they are mexican they have a mexican accent, but still talk in english lolol"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,New world for Kingdom Hearts 3?
xlnPHQ3TLX8,COCO!
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"This looks very similar to the book of life, but still looks promising."
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"El libro de la vida 2?
The book of life 2?"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,I love those old school looking train stations. Looked almost like the one from Shining Time Station.
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Oh boy, Cars 3 has some competition this year. I wonder which film will be better"
xlnPHQ3TLX8,So this is Book of Life but with pixar in a nutshell
xlnPHQ3TLX8,"Pixar, I love you! (And ""The Book of Life"" as well :3)"

ySy8mcceTno,coaie imi dau laba
ySy8mcceTno,why with idiot teens????
ySy8mcceTno,"some cut scenes were ""too gory"" for the audience, that probably made the movie even more of a hot pile of garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else from Massachusetts so this is actually a little creepier since it's based in Massachusetts 😂
ySy8mcceTno,SONY really enjoy making movies based on old Dead Internet trends & MEMES

ySy8mcceTno,Movie...was...crap...
ySy8mcceTno,I've seen the movie. MOST OF THE THINGS IN THE TRAILER. AIN'T. IN. THE. MOVIE!!
ySy8mcceTno,So half the trailer is a lie. But the biggest lie was the change in lighting. It was terribly dark in the actually film.
ySy8mcceTno,In conclusion what was the meaning that wanted to convey this movie?

Yeah! Slendy is awesome"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendercrazy!!

ySy8mcceTno,"Next film: Sonic.EXE 
11 September 2023."
ySy8mcceTno,"I recommend this.. 




For those who want to waste their money"
ySy8mcceTno,Movie didnt even show half of what happened in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,...
ySy8mcceTno,Most cliche horror movie ever
ySy8mcceTno,"Why did this have to be made??? Like, seriously?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is no joke that’s why ppl keep dissapering he’s a demon...who feeds off of ur fear...don’t be afraid don’t run stay ask him...why?
ySy8mcceTno,Tökre bekaksiztam
ySy8mcceTno,"i wish the start of the movie was a group of children playing on the woods and suddenly slender man capture the children
then a detective must find the children in the woods"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie was sooooooo stale and maybe it'd have been better if anything the trailer showed made it into the movie apart from the hanging dolls most of this was cut. Also the ending, while I expected it to end that way other than her sister living on to earn before she probably eventually dies, it was still bad in that absolutely nothing was solved, they didn't set anything up for another movie other than maybe the guy watching it. Bad movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"half the scenes in this trailer (all the interesting ones) weren't even in this movie, consider me disappointed"
ySy8mcceTno,It's one of those movies where the trailer is better than the movie. What a fail
ySy8mcceTno,Oscar the spoiler
ySy8mcceTno,That looked cool
ySy8mcceTno,"This is a pretty decent movie nothing mind blowing like a quiet place, or hereditary, but the movie is pretty good enjoyable to watch the movie is your typical mythological film like Candyman or Bloody Mary type story. Slender Man is a little different at least when you want to summon him you don't say his name. For something that was created on the internet I thought they did a good job of coming up with a story, I do wish that they gave Slender Man more of an origin on where he came from and stuff but the mystery of him is pretty cool, you don't see that into many horror films. The only thing about this movie is it was not scary it was a popcorn flick, but I do like those movies as well. I thought the story, acting, directing and special effects were good. The only thing I have to complain about is that they introduce this one character that is sort of the love interest to the lead actress and she tells him not to watch the movie and they hint that he does but then they don't go anywhere with it. but all in all, it's a good movie the climax is pretty good though. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. This movie is Cinematasticrating 4/5"

ySy8mcceTno,It's trash
ySy8mcceTno,"0:50 ""Michael myers"" ? dafuq"
ySy8mcceTno,Just got done watching the movie itself. Most of the scenes in the trailer arent even in the movie. I recommend not watching it.. pitiful.
ySy8mcceTno,"i'm watching the movie as i type this, it's just cringy, don't watch it. i'm having the most difficult time finishing it and keeping my attention to it. it's so bad, and not scary at all. the free game that started all this was way more scarier and that says a LOT."
ySy8mcceTno,They need to make all the creepypasta movies..like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,aaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,This is not about Slender man this is just suicide
ySy8mcceTno,Is this movie worth watch ?

ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"Wooow 😱😱😱
Den glæder jeg mig til at se 
Har hørt mange rygter om slenderman 
Man ved faktisk ikke om 
Han virkelig eksistere 🤔?
Nogen som ved det??"
ySy8mcceTno,NOPE
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like the Blair Witch mixed with The Ring. A Slender Man movie with 1% of slender man on screen they should have made the movie like the game slender man the arrival
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is so dumb i mean they made a movie based off a creepypsta legend. Horror movies have come to a terrible time where everything is a remake or a sequel or based on the stupidest things to attempt to make you scared of the dumbest and most least menacing thing out there

Yet I am the idiot who has the movie and is watching it"
ySy8mcceTno,"Which one is scary;
This movie or the Marble Hornets?"
ySy8mcceTno,*marble hornets cast is laughing so hard in a big sofa as they yell* WHAT A BUNCH OF LOSERS HAHAHA MH WAS NOT MADE BY A COMPANY BUT A SMALL TEAM AND THIS???!!!!* Tim Sutton laughs evilly as him and jay are 😂*
ySy8mcceTno,It is supposed to be a horror film bt honestly I laughed thru some parts of the film. I didn't feel scared at all. They ruined it!
ySy8mcceTno,So Badddd i see this movie so bad!
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't recall a lot of the scenes in the movie. It was an ok movie you can watch with younger people. I didn't find it boring, but one or two times it did kinda drag."
ySy8mcceTno,people say the trailer is better then the movie. I dont even like the trailer so I guess im not watching this one xD
ySy8mcceTno,Seeing this today
ySy8mcceTno,"Absolute rip off of The Ring! Only, The Ring was actually good."
ySy8mcceTno,I souldn't watch it. It sucked
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie was so very VERY disappointing. I was full of so much anticipation, but the trailer hyped it up way more than it should have. The end was really anticlimactic and the trailer showed, like, 5 or 6 scenes that weren't even in the movie at all."
ySy8mcceTno,Half the trailer is not in the movie wtfuck
ySy8mcceTno,"here's my opinion towards slender man


pros:
the character development was pretty good
slender man looked fucking awesome
it was pretty spooky
i had fun staring at the menu screen for 20 minutes waiting for my 7 year old brother to leave my room
that one girl was thick
the animation wasn't too bad
it had a bit of kinky porn in it
the previews were entertaining


cons:
pretty poor acting
most of the scenes were kinda boring
half of the scenes in the trailer weren't in the movie
it would've been nice to see some boobs in the make out scene
i had a seizure during a couple of the scenes
and the girl with the black hair had a uni-brow


overall i give it an 11/10
thank you so much for making this movie Nintendo"
ySy8mcceTno,What is this movie about?
ySy8mcceTno,Was this movie really as bad as people said it was? If so why? I didn't even know it came out this year.
ySy8mcceTno,Does Slender Man have anything to do with Enderman in Minecraft?
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Really really scary
ySy8mcceTno,"I hate this movie even more, many things of this trailer are not in the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,they call it Slender Man i call it You kidding me Man....
ySy8mcceTno,"movie sucks... easy simple... 90% of the things that are happenin  you cant see.... is to dark... might aswell just turn of the tv and lsn to the¨
 voices"
ySy8mcceTno,spoiler alert: its literally a comedy
ySy8mcceTno,Good thing I read the comments I almost purchased the movie on YouTube!!! Anyone knows what is a good scary horror movie to watch !
ySy8mcceTno,"Actually want to see the work from the original projects getting recognition, since their still active."
ySy8mcceTno,"yes, they could have done a Better Work, but the movie is watchable and is ok nice."
ySy8mcceTno,A lot of scenes were cut out of fear of public backlash
ySy8mcceTno,varios no estaban en la película😑
ySy8mcceTno,"""Sony screen gems"" is a subdivision of Sony that is at fault for cutting several major scenes from the plot, days before the showing. They mandated a PG-13 rating and ""reworked"" the script I.E. they removed whole scenes all together. They destroyed something that had real potential and didn't even release an un-cut version. I honestly want my money back"
ySy8mcceTno,It seems boring
ySy8mcceTno,"I wish I'd read these comments before I wasted my evening sitting through this garbage, waiting for it to get scary - or remotely like the trailer.  Shameful rip off.  Click bait on an epic scale."
ySy8mcceTno,Slendrina are you here 0:38
ySy8mcceTno,Abseloute trash
ySy8mcceTno,Creapy soundtrack °o°
ySy8mcceTno,Worst project I've ever participated in.
ySy8mcceTno,Don't waste money on this. So horrible!
ySy8mcceTno,The video game is so scary
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t remember being in a movie 🤔🤔
ySy8mcceTno,00:58 best acting
ySy8mcceTno,Is this worth seeing? I'm seeing it tonight with my dad. I don't know how i feel about it.
ySy8mcceTno,To creepy I remember the game was not that creepy
ySy8mcceTno,He gets in your head...like a virus...
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't think the movie sucked at all. Though i do understand most of these comments in here saying that the movie sucked because some of the scenes in the trailer weren't in the movie. However, even though they weren't in the trailer it could possibly follow up in a second movie or two in a paradox. I not sure if anyone else feels the same, but i feel this is just a start of showing how slenderman is. I recommend watching the movie than other people saying don't watch it. Try THE MOVIE i hope there's more movies to come to confuse others in the trailers to make us have our own theories and what other abilities we could see of slenderman. Sorry that it was long."
ySy8mcceTno,Bad ending!
ySy8mcceTno,DO NOT WATCH!
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets is or was better.
ySy8mcceTno,Hahaha stupid
ySy8mcceTno,they cut out all the best parts of the movie
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"Just watched, most of this add was not in the movie. It was an absolute waste of time. Pure shite."
ySy8mcceTno,I didnt get to watch the movie cause my aunt couldn't get me a ticket sh3 works at tge movie theater but she still voukdnt get me a ticket
ySy8mcceTno,I’m just here for the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,really bad movie and half of what you see in the trailer is not even in the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Stupidest movie ever. Waste of time. Don't waste your time. Is not good at all.
ySy8mcceTno,The Static Is Gross In The Movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie should be called Silly Man,because it's so ridiculous, and not even scary at all."
ySy8mcceTno,ILOVE YOU Slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"La mitad de la cosas que sacáis en el trailer no salen en la película, como la escena del bisturí en el ojo, la chica escribiendo HIM o el chico tirándose del edificio.... Una decepción...."
ySy8mcceTno,wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"2024 “EMPTY BLACK SOCKETS”

ySy8mcceTno,"Too much.. this is like Iphone, it gets different scenes ideas from other movies and combine them in one called ""Slender Man"" :D
didn't see it, and probably won't, the music just effects the mind while the movie looks typical."
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon when

ySy8mcceTno,"Yo, I knew Brandon Ingram would get into showbiz"
ySy8mcceTno,"well, gotta change my like button to dislike"
ySy8mcceTno,the trailer was better then the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony and GreenGems i was waiting for a super horror movie, but this is a real bullshit... Scary Movie is more terrorific than this garbage... i wont watch this movie, not even ilegal way... sorry dislike"
ySy8mcceTno,Worst horror movie of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,trailer is ok but the movie is crap
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"First i was reading all these negative comments,and then watched the movie.i enjoyed from begining to end.decent 2018 horror movie.i prefer slender man more than ""the nun"""
ySy8mcceTno,Make it stop this is Cinematic cruelty
ySy8mcceTno,"And slenderman isn't real! For heavens sake, if you watch videos of him your able to see his face and I feel bad for him. He has disabilities in his legs and even if he's creepy I feel bad but he does kill kids like slenderina like his daughter"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is bogus! If your a parent, and you have a kid, do not take your kid to this movie and don't watch the video the true story of slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,slender man is a meme stop
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is more disappointing than myself
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know why ending is always incomplete in these type of horror movies? I mean always ghost or something like that win..
ySy8mcceTno,IMBD= 3.1%...RT CRITICS= 8% RT USERS =20%......im sure i saw  producers and director standing outside the dole office the other day...
ySy8mcceTno,"Am I the only one that when they see slender man, they automatically think of Chameleon the spider man villain?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendrina movie next please she is the daughter of Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok not that good as a film, but the idea with the cell phone videocall was brilliant."
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t do this some one had a stabbing about this
ySy8mcceTno,Good thing I didn't watch this....heard it was trash. Man this movie could've been horribly scary if they had done it right. How much you want to bet that they didn't even play the games at all?!

ySy8mcceTno,ya la vi no m sorprendio mucho :v
ySy8mcceTno,Please Sony just give up all of your movie copyrights(Don't Forget Web-Head) and give them to Disney or someone else. You guys making even worse than Diseny's Live Action Remakes.
ySy8mcceTno,No video no Sender Man
ySy8mcceTno,A boring movie with dumb teenagers.. typical
ySy8mcceTno,Am i the only one who found this movie scary?
ySy8mcceTno,Just watched this today. Wish I could get my money back. Totally disappointed. THE Slenderman creature was an actor in the film. I’d expected it to be all CGI. Which is likely appropriate in horror films. People should watch the HBO documentary BEWARE THE SLENDERMAN. a REAL story that will shock you to the core.
ySy8mcceTno,Half the stuff in this trailer isn't even in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,#thisgavemenightmares
ySy8mcceTno,"stupid movie I do not know why they make you waste your time watching something so but so absurd. thank goodness I did not go to see her, thank goodness I did not waste time, watching idiots make movies"

ySy8mcceTno,This movie is rated PG-13.  Shocking.  I would've thought rated R for sure.
ySy8mcceTno,The movies didn't have any of this init
ySy8mcceTno,thats a bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,This movie sucks. Stop making bad video game movies.
ySy8mcceTno,"I just watched the movie and had not previously seen the trailer. The movie was not as terrible as it has been described, in fact it has good things going for it like decent acting and beautiful cinematography, but I can understand people feeling frustrated about it seeing that a seemingly good amount of content was cut (presumably to avoid and R rating). Personally I liked it though it's far from original as very obviously it's heavily influenced by The Ring, I think after seeing some of what was cut that the director intended it to be a more intense and darker film, this would greatly benefit from a Director's Cut."
ySy8mcceTno,"youtube comment section never fails, not gonna bother watching #travistren #tradealerts"
ySy8mcceTno,"That movie looks really bad. I have seen both of the ""IT"" movies and all of ""The Conjuring"" movies! That is NOT scary! -Grandma Joe"
ySy8mcceTno,Movie is not scary

ySy8mcceTno,is this really a bad movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I was hoping for a slender-man movie for ages.... this isn't what I wanted.
ySy8mcceTno,"didn't quite understand what story this is? just a lot of ""scary""? images? I don't really think I can get scared by scary images, grossed out maybe, but I need a really good story get dragged in.. didn't quite get that feeling from this trailer, almost no dialog? o.O"

ySy8mcceTno,Foda
ySy8mcceTno,"I haven't seen the movie, but I knew from the start that it would bomb, and I have a feeling they took more inspiration from that news story about the 12-year old girls stabbing their friend than they did from the actual story."
ySy8mcceTno,Brandon Ingram's movie 😂
ySy8mcceTno,most anticipated
ySy8mcceTno,A lot of the stuff in this trailer is now actually in the movie. It was kind of a rip off and it wasn't super scary either. Did anyone see Sally in the Slender Man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,How much is the age limit
ySy8mcceTno,Wot an absolute mad lad for stabbing herself in the eye
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this for 5 years and people are saying it's terrible. You should be careful.

ySy8mcceTno,"Like, half the scenes in this trailer aren't actually in the movie. What a boring, slow, low budget, teenage schlock horror movie. Really disappointing because I like the character of slenderman."

ySy8mcceTno,"Movie was ok. I liked the psychological element, and when that camera went through Chloe's house, my heart was PUMPIN'. The acting was pretty bad tho, they were late on the job, was kinda too stale with the atmosphere at times, and it is a Sony movie. Still, I'd see it again.

Also, I wish that ending part with the police was actually in the movie >:/"

ySy8mcceTno,doesnt look that good
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the movies ending was going to have someone looking 4 pages in the forest and everypage he/she would get would make it even more tense and in the end well the static
ySy8mcceTno,"I say this with absolutely no hyperbole or exaggeration: ”Slender Man” should have been made around the time of the characters popularity and not in the year 2018 where it’s purpose for Sony is just to administer another blatantly obvious cash-grab off of a household name in the horror genre. It’s mundane and uninspired in its atmosphere and setting in every aspect of the word, the acting isn’t remotely close to being good, it almost takes no SHAME in borrowing horror tropes from other movies and if anything, the film goes against some of the very aspects needed to actually make a horror film HORRIFYING. It is not scary and it’s ridiculously boring as hell. 


For like the first 20 minutes of the film, it drones on you for a little bit but it could’ve be done exponentially worse. It’s not god-awful but it’s just bad. The moment we pass the 30 minute mark though, everything just sinks completely downhill. The vast majority of characters involved are copy and paste cutouts of generic character stereotypes that are further exacerbated by bad acting. The creepy imagery is a nice stretch since it’s generally disturbing but not many of those moments are present to keep the film interesting. Most of the scenes are either so lacking in its ability to try or generally didn’t play out that to me, every single “scare” scene presented immediately started to look and feel the same. I’ve tried my hardest to find any speck of enjoyment out of this movie but apart from some creepy imagery and a few jumpscares (because of course there is), nothing REALLY stood out to me, even more so with the film having generally ridiculous moments plastered throughout its runtime.



There’s no real characters, no real character development, no real threat presented, no real atmosphere embodied here and apart from the creepy imagery it displays, this is YET ANOTHER movie you’ve already seen countless times already. 



The entire film is just a dull chore to watch. That’s all there is to it."

ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man was a fat piece of crap movie. Too predictable, too unoriginal, too much unneeded special FX both visually and musically and the put together plot was just too elementary. Not entertaining at all unless you're 8 years old or younger. Sharknado was more entertaining because at least you could laugh at how ridiculous it is however with Slender Man you're rolling eyes instead"
ySy8mcceTno,Ooooh Joey Kings in this movie😍
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer was better than the movie.  saw it last night. it tried to be thrilling and mess with you psychologically. But was executed poorly and some of the scenes had the audience literally laughing (I'M NOT JOKING FOR REAL) . Lot of scenes were cut too such as:
1:06 Writing on the mirror
1:15 Writing on the mirror
1:24 Writing on the mirror
1:26 Kid jumping off bridge
1:28-1:35 Chloe's suicide
1:59-2:20 Girl found by police

ySy8mcceTno,"trailer malisimo, ojala la pelicula tenga una buena historia porque el trailer es un triste intento de asustar con imagenes grotescas y que no llega a nada."

ySy8mcceTno,"If you need a laugh after the disappointment that is this movie, watch the video about it on my channel. Not one for self promoting in comments but I feel the community needed something good to come from this crap movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Not my slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is a better movie than the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,It is comical how many times this movie pulls the exact same jump scare over and over again.

ySy8mcceTno,Next move :Airida Trida.
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, it looks so stupid that I can add this movie on my movies-to-avoid list."

ySy8mcceTno,Instead of Vietnam flashbacks I am getting old slender man game flashbacks
ySy8mcceTno,"I've watched the movie, it wasn't good"
ySy8mcceTno,I saw this today it was pretty good!
ySy8mcceTno,"Something strange had to happen with the production. It's like 30 minutes were cut from the movie. They cut Chloe's s eye gouging scene, so every other scene at the school was likely cut etc etc"
ySy8mcceTno,Half of these scenes weren’t in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I just saw this movie today. Some of this stuff wasn't even in it.
ySy8mcceTno,"8===D for all your slender haters

ySy8mcceTno,*What next Granny?*
ySy8mcceTno,looks boring tbh
ySy8mcceTno,"Horrible movie, it has too many deleted scenes, even some of the ones that were promised to make it into the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"The Lord is in the Temple
The Demons are on the Loose
Seeking whom they may devour
For their own personal use
The children like sheep to slaughter
Will be laid to waste
Blood will flow like water
The Demons will have their taste
For judgement day is calling
All across the land
The vengeance will be falling
Few will understand
The demons have no mercy
They do because they can
For those who are lost in darkness
Will be found by Slender Man😈"
ySy8mcceTno,So slenderman is a portrayal of Tall grey aliens?
ySy8mcceTno,The biggest bulshit movie in historie
ySy8mcceTno,Apparently a lot of companies are making movies after horror games  first FNAF now this
ySy8mcceTno,Sequel?
ySy8mcceTno,Top
ySy8mcceTno,i thik it will be very low movie

ySy8mcceTno,これ今日見たがそんな面白くない
ySy8mcceTno,WTF?!
ySy8mcceTno,I would watch slender man because it is an awesome&bizarre movie also entertaining too
ySy8mcceTno,Aren’t there supposed to be pages? Btw this is AMAZING
ySy8mcceTno,A obvious cash in
ySy8mcceTno,"This was truly tewwible and for teens. Not for those that appreciate a real horror movie. If you can, watch it for free. Not worth a ticket, unless you're 11-17. just my 2cents"
ySy8mcceTno,Scary
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry but I can't remember the last time Sony made a decent horror film. Stop trying so hard to make it accessible to 13 year olds, the audience for this character is now at least 18. Should've made it R rated. Extremely disappointing."
ySy8mcceTno,"This is so disturbing, disgusting ad demonic compared to Slender Man: The 8 Pages. I wouldn't recommend it."
ySy8mcceTno,AGE RATING ???
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone know where to watch this movie online for free?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is so good!!!
ySy8mcceTno,So much stuff in here that wasn’t in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Do yourself a favor people and watch marble Hornets instead it's so much more scary and well made
ySy8mcceTno,Well i wasnt expecting that... COOL!!!
ySy8mcceTno,OMG IM CRYING MY EYES OUT THATS WO SCARY OMGOMGOMG
ySy8mcceTno,me
ySy8mcceTno,OMG DAT SCARED ME OMG IM CRYING
ySy8mcceTno,Most bullshit movie ever
ySy8mcceTno,So I just watched the movie. And about 50% of this trailer...never happened. Never saw it. Never did see a clip.
ySy8mcceTno,"Только с премьеры: фильм унылое говно не тратьте время!!! Графика Слендера пластилиновая , а от некоторых моментов было не страшно а просто ржал весь зал 🤣 Впервые вижу фильм в котором нет сцен из трейлера! Причём сука, ключевых! Я почти ощутил физическую боль после просмотра от глупости фильма! Этот трейлер страшнее фильма !! Какого черта!"
ySy8mcceTno,"I can whip up a script in my head that closely relates to the original game, and then, there's this thing they did instead."
ySy8mcceTno,i kinda like sender man
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks! I hate it!
ySy8mcceTno,"Half of this is not in the movie, i am not joking xD"
ySy8mcceTno,I have this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Sawit, but I was heavily disappointed."
ySy8mcceTno,I want to be excited for this but disappointment frightens me
ySy8mcceTno,HOLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,"welp looks like Screengems actually did it, they turned an old game into a movie years after its popularity spike, you might say it's a bad decision imo"
ySy8mcceTno,Is the part where the girl comes out of the forest with like black stuff on her mouth in the final cut?
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this movie worth seeing.
Dosent even look scary."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender-Man FLOPPED LIKE A FISH
ySy8mcceTno,So creepy
ySy8mcceTno,Alguem br?
ySy8mcceTno,slendumannen!
ySy8mcceTno,Did they rip of *every* visual trope from the Ring?
ySy8mcceTno,i gotta be honest this is so dissapointing and boring af
ySy8mcceTno,Is this so scary
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the sequel to  Ms. Peregrine's School for Peculiar Children. When the Slenderman finally remembered which movie universe he should be in?
ySy8mcceTno,I expected this movie to fail. My expectations were correct.
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing horror about this movie unless you’re afraid off trees
ySy8mcceTno,They make two venom movie lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok but this trailer shows TWO character deaths that were cut out of the final version of a 90 minute movie, leaving the characters just as loose ends. What are you thinking Sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is good tbh .
ySy8mcceTno,"#FalseAdvertisement 
Only 50% of this trailer was actually in there"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s not really the same cause I seen this movie and most of the vid was not in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Sií
ySy8mcceTno,Mario was right. There is a gay Elephant noise.
ySy8mcceTno,next movie :crooked man
ySy8mcceTno,ESCOLA DO INDIO
ySy8mcceTno,I'll just wait until a directors cut with all the scenes they cut are included. Maybe then it'll be more interesting to watch
ySy8mcceTno,*tender man
ySy8mcceTno,It's not a horror movie if it's PG-13.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Ayee can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,"Sooo much from this trailer was not even in the movie....
(Spoilers below)







The chick stabbing herself in the eye, the girl writing ""HIM"" at the beginning of the trailer, also the last scene of the trailer with the cops approaching the girl coming out of the forest, she's not even in the movie. As well as that guy jumping off the roof. Just so many big scenes taken away that I was looking forward to."
ySy8mcceTno,you dont turn creepypasta into movies
ySy8mcceTno,"Lmao, more than half of the trailer wasn't in the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"i saw the movie yesterday and half of the trailer wasn’t in the movie,"
ySy8mcceTno,I just watched this yesterday and the trailer has cut scenes I didn't see in the film...disappointing.
ySy8mcceTno,I love how half the scenes in this weren't in the actual movie.
ySy8mcceTno,The girl who killed herself with the scapel is a deleted scene? I didn't see it in the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 - dementor much
ySy8mcceTno,Half of the scenes in this trailer are not even in the movie like 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,The comment sections here is better than and more entertaining than the movie trailer itself!
ySy8mcceTno,Half this trailer isn’t in the fucking movie.
ySy8mcceTno,OMGGG wat MGGGG slenderman OMGGG
ySy8mcceTno,Most the scenes here werent even in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,bit dissapoiNted with this film
ySy8mcceTno,Why The Hell am i seeing slenderman dreams before i have Even seen this trailer wait sould i Even watch this If i have seen slenderman dreams
ySy8mcceTno,He just wants $20
ySy8mcceTno,ENDER MAN
ySy8mcceTno,I like how slender man started off as a simple creepypasta/game but then a trailer for slender man comes out
ySy8mcceTno,I HOPE THE EDITORS FOR THIS TRAILER GOT FIRED
ySy8mcceTno,"I want to see this movie just to be like ""This sucked"""
ySy8mcceTno,Am tarek zoom
ySy8mcceTno,I hear this is one of those movies that looks good but then people say its crap
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay 90% of the scenes in this trailer, werent in the goddamn movie once"
ySy8mcceTno,I want there to be slender man 2
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that the only two somewhat interesting parts in this trailer weren’t in the movie pisses me off tbh
ySy8mcceTno,I remember seeing this trailer for the first time and my opinion on it stays the same thanks to reviews I've seen online: it looks cheap and really corny. The idea of a Slender Man movie should've been done long ago (I know there was one before but by an actual big company there hasn't).
ySy8mcceTno,"WELCOME BACK TO THE INTERNET SLENDERMAN, AND WELCOME TO HOLLYWOOD!! i was waiting for the day they made a movie since i was 10. and i really hope they dont change lore, andif they do make another movie do the eight pages or something. Keep The Lore Original!!"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful.
ySy8mcceTno,boy I can't wait to see how people utterly bastardize the lore even further
ySy8mcceTno,Qual vai ser a idade minina para poder assistir o filme? ;_;
ySy8mcceTno,I would be the one in the group who wouldn’t look at the picture and be called a wuss but then laugh as all of the others go mad when they’re trying to go to sleep.
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, just great. They took the genuinely good concept of Slender Man, and blandly turned it into a generic horror movie to sit awkwardly amongst all the others, it'll rake in some cash because of the nostalgia, people will be bitterly disappointed, but Sony will be sat there in their earnings and not care about the film's actual quality.
Good job Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,I am waiting for ben drowned the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Haha
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be trash
ySy8mcceTno,1:55 Allahu Akbar? Dafuq?
ySy8mcceTno,no they can't do this
ySy8mcceTno,"lol, I bet the next movie is FNaF. 😂 but, this movie looks pretty good."
ySy8mcceTno,NOT WORTH IT PLS DONT WATCH
ySy8mcceTno,I like how a quarter of the scenes in the trailer aren’t in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,this is great!
ySy8mcceTno,"it started as just a classic video game, now its a movie?? WOW!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,wish it was like the video games
ySy8mcceTno,The best scenes in this trailer didn’t even happen in the fucking movie just sayin
ySy8mcceTno,"Gotta admit, the trailer was really well done 👍"
ySy8mcceTno,I like how some of this never happened in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"is this a good movie, guys?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Moviepass, the movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Makes me pissed how none of the good scenes in the trailer happen in the movie. Like Chloe stabbing herself in the classroom or the girl coming out of the forest at the end. Shitty advertising. Shitty movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 just called, they want their movie back."
ySy8mcceTno,"Never got why people feared the All-mighty Long Boi. Maybe it's because I like characters that don't have facial features, his dorky suit is also pretty funny"
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 THAT SCARED ME #CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,the trailer literally doesnt explain anything
ySy8mcceTno,"My god,
Once a creepypasta, then a game, then a movie :b"
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie : Granny for all the 6 year olds getting scared at a grandma with a baseball nat
ySy8mcceTno,This movie was honestly good and a little bad but I recommend
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey sony, 6 years late are we"
ySy8mcceTno,"ooooo spooky ""long man going to scare kids for 2 hours"" sounds like a great movie idea."
ySy8mcceTno,"So dissipointed that this trailer doesnt even represent the ginal product, it could have been great"
ySy8mcceTno,How meany creepy posta are in it
ySy8mcceTno,"Bad Movie, bad trailer. Not go show this is movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, cause teen girls stabbing their friends and cutting themselves need more encouragement eh."
ySy8mcceTno,I watched it. It's really good but the trailer (the part with the little girl writing on the mirror and coming out the woods)  is clickbait
ySy8mcceTno,TRASHHHHHH do not waste your money
ySy8mcceTno,(( David luiz )) in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,The scarry rhing is im seeing this tonight in theaters 😣
ySy8mcceTno,"Saw the movie last night!! I liked it!! It has scary parts and didn't get too crazy at the end. Overall, a good movie!!"
ySy8mcceTno,They can start shining up that Oscar right now...maybe make one shaped like slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Fake or real
ySy8mcceTno,Aaaand let the horror troupes rain.
ySy8mcceTno,I WANT A WHOLE CREPPYPASTA MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this shitty trend died in 2015😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,this is bullshit. not the slender man I've read about
ySy8mcceTno,i see _NO_ pages. i am dissapointed.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm pumped up for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I watched the movie, it was great"
ySy8mcceTno,pg-13? Atleast they know their audience. How I would of done this: found footage style movie with slenderman stalking them. But I guess thats not as appealing to the 13-14 year old audience that still finds slender man relevant. But I personally never got really invested in creepypastas so what do I know.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is a little bit late and it doesn't look that good. But I could be wrong we will have to see.
ySy8mcceTno,Half of this trailer wasn’t even in the movie!
ySy8mcceTno,The funniest part of the movie 1:20
ySy8mcceTno,So just seen the movie. The girl never stabbed her self in the eye?
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't a trailer supposed to make you WANT to see the movie..
ySy8mcceTno,Horrorrible trailer... I expected more and I feel like the movie is going to be worse :(
ySy8mcceTno,If anyone watched it 😭😭was it good ??i want it to be but that’s unlikely 🤦‍♀️😭
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is god awful
ySy8mcceTno,I want a movie about a guy who spreads fake rumors called slander man
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one pissed off that some of these scenes aren’t even in the movie?!
ySy8mcceTno,"The song in the end, wat is it? It’s so creepy."
ySy8mcceTno,THE RUMORS OF THE MOVIE WERE TRUE
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie was such a fail . I just watched it and its like a rip off of The Ring but with Slenderman. Too much cgi makes it look cheap and cheesy. Save your money ! The scenes at 1:08, 1:28, 1:32 , 2:04 weren’t even in the movie"
ySy8mcceTno,The first official Slender Man movie and they ruined it . A lot of the scenes in this trailer aren’t even in the movie because Screen Gems was too scared to get backlash from making it too gory and not “PG-13” . The movie is literally just pasted together unfinished . Can we delete it and do another ? It had soo much potential . If James Wan directed it probably would’ve been 100000000x better . 😒
ySy8mcceTno,GAY
ySy8mcceTno,Boi I thot she was writing HIV
ySy8mcceTno,Saw this last night. Crowd was mostly laughing. Waste of money. 2/10
ySy8mcceTno,Turned out the movie is.....  Bad I watched it and it was a waste of money. The story line was rushed and the girl didn't even stab herself and wasn't scary at all and slender hardly appears
ySy8mcceTno,Not worth watching
ySy8mcceTno,Who came here to watch this trailer after seeing Madan gowri's slender man video..! (India)
ySy8mcceTno,I'm laughing way too hard at the comment section
ySy8mcceTno,"Things in this trailer that aren't in the actual movie:
The girl writing on the wall starting at 1:09
Guy falling off the roof at 1:27
The girl stabbing herself in the eye at 1:33
And the girl walking out of the woods starting at 2:30
In other words, majority of what's in this trailer ISN'T EVEN IN THE MOVIE. I bet what happened was the filmmakers wanted an R rating but Sony made them cut it down to a PG-13. God fucking dammit, Sony, you ruined Slenderman. I really hope they release an unrated cut on blu-ray or something but I'd like to see what this movie could've been before Sony chickened out and became too afraid of scaring the children in their HORROR FILM."
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s not all that great. Saw it yesterday and I expected more. There are times where it takes a while for there to be a jump scare , but they’re obvious. I see how it’s not an R rated film since not too too many creepy things are actually shown like depicted in the trailer. I personally thought it was short. The background of slender man needed to be explained more but I guess it wasn’t since this film is meant for a younger audience who is too familiar with the creepypasta. The graphic design of slender man himself was pretty awesome."
ySy8mcceTno,Lol I’m going to watch it today yay
ySy8mcceTno,this was clear.... clear as mud...
ySy8mcceTno,Movie was garbage ending was stupid so waste of money movie theater was empty
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe 15% of the footage from this trailer is actually IN the movie. And none of the scary parts.
ySy8mcceTno,It's near
ySy8mcceTno,"Remember when slender man YouTube videos were popping, ahh the good old days"
ySy8mcceTno,15% on the moist meter.
ySy8mcceTno,I don't want to see him
ySy8mcceTno,it does not even look that scary to me
ySy8mcceTno,Looks fairly shite
ySy8mcceTno,I love Slender Man it's such a cool movie
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie:Jeff the killer vs slender man the legend
ySy8mcceTno,"I find it deeply offensive that this movie is even being released. Low class move, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,The Ring but it isn't scary
ySy8mcceTno,It’s all about Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,In the movie half the scenes in this trailer didn't exist
ySy8mcceTno,iam so scare man
ySy8mcceTno,Six years too late
ySy8mcceTno,no you just didn't copy the ring to do this. tell me im wrong!
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer was so promising. The actual movie... eh, 5/10."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks not scary at all _/(.-.)\_
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman and me is like ""what the hell did i just watch"""
ySy8mcceTno,"If my face was an emoji, this would be it 😍😍"
ySy8mcceTno,Some things in the trailer never happen in the movie... what a disappointment.
ySy8mcceTno,They're right now filming Slender Man II: More Cheap Violence.  Scheduled for release in 2000 never.
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer is so different to what the actual movie was like. SOOO MANY SCENES in this trailer DINT EVEN SHOW UP in the movie itselfff and the guy talking only comes out for 20 seconds and literally all he says in this trailer are all/half his lines in the movie
SPOILERSS
they actually do not show any deaths in the movie, and the suicides that take place in this trailer never show up on the screen, in fact they even leave off the girl who stabbed herself at her house and just say she ""went insane"" and there is literally no dude that jumps off the school building, AND the scene at 2:02 never happens/shows up in the movie itself...."
ySy8mcceTno,"I saw this movie today, and I just have to say this trailer has so many other details that are not in the actual movie. Its a good movie they just couldve done better on the graphics of slenderman to make him look more realistic."
ySy8mcceTno,"ppl dont just dissapear. umm yeah they kind do, especially in horror movies, and at night in a forest"
ySy8mcceTno,The girls date with tom when she was hallucinating was hilarious.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm gonna go c it tomorrow
ySy8mcceTno,The girl stabs herself in the eye in the trailer but not in the actual movie
ySy8mcceTno,DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Its late but you sure fucking know I’m going to watch it
ySy8mcceTno,Wow I never expected Slenderman to be a Movie. Used to be a Normal game but then all of sudden SlenderMan Became Popular. I guess that means we are getting a Granny Movie soon
ySy8mcceTno,"Looking at the trailer after watching this movie and i notice how much was cut, probably to make it pg 13. Probably would have been a lot more terrifying if they went all the way and made it rated R"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a stupid movie
ySy8mcceTno,The slenderman has real life
ySy8mcceTno,Spoiler: half of these aren’t in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,don’t waste your time
ySy8mcceTno,wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"You basically scrapped this entire trailer, out of the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,the games are scarier the this poop
ySy8mcceTno,The part where she stabbed herself in the eye was not a part of the movie 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman's my favorite killer
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone saw the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,So many things in this trailer are not in the movie. But it was still pretty decent
ySy8mcceTno,"I went to see this movie yesterday. I actually enjoyed it. Some parts could’ve been executed better, but overall, it was a good movie. I hope they make more creepypasta movies in the future"
ySy8mcceTno,Watching this trailer after the movie makes me realize how much was cut out
ySy8mcceTno,95%of what's in this trailer didn't even make it to theaters
ySy8mcceTno,I am seeing this movie today at 3:50 so excited!
ySy8mcceTno,"The people that review slender man say it doesn't follow the real game. But I think it does. Does anyone agree? Anyone have a,second opinion"
ySy8mcceTno,😄😂😥
ySy8mcceTno,Some parts of the trailer didnt happen in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Im a little triggered. Theres a few parts where slendy is not really...well the real one. Like, he MURDERS children and eat their souls. He doesnt feakin set them free. And wheres all he’s tentacles? He can also speak with  telekinesis. Ugh, the cringe. Im s H o O k"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks Cheesy As FK.
I'm going to go watch it 😃"
ySy8mcceTno,"*SPOILERS, I guess*  Everything from 1:26 to 1:36 is not in the final cut of the film.  Oddly enough.  The scene in the science classroom remains (there is even foreshadowing, with the students dissecting animals' eyes), but the African American girl is not present.  The scene at 2:00, with the girl emerging from the forest bloodied and dazed, is also MIA."
ySy8mcceTno,Yay.
ySy8mcceTno,Smh i was only here cuz of joey king
ySy8mcceTno,"""Time to grab an easy hype IP an make the most generic shitshow we can think of.""
-Sony all the time"
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie
Sonic.exe - 2021"
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie: Eyeless Jack coming 2020
ySy8mcceTno,nice trailer
ySy8mcceTno,So much of this was not in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Bullshit movie
ySy8mcceTno,A lot of these scenes were not in the movie. Disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,i’ve never seen Joey King tbh
ySy8mcceTno,this movie sucked
ySy8mcceTno,HE GETS IN YOUR HEAD LIKE A VIRUS
ySy8mcceTno,Movie was great
ySy8mcceTno,"Just watched movie, was a lot scarier than I thought it would be lol"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m going to see this tomorrow. Can’t wait.
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer looks like absolute garbage.  This looks like a 50 year old's idea who is trying to be hip and with the times but is ten years behind and doesn't even know what slenderman's story actually was.
ySy8mcceTno,how did i not see the trailer already I'm shook
ySy8mcceTno,This movie was awful. What a god damned surprise.
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is scarier than the movie..
ySy8mcceTno,A lot of this wasn't even in the movie....wow
ySy8mcceTno,Better never than late i guess
ySy8mcceTno,next movie scp containment breach
ySy8mcceTno,"Slendrina,granny,slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is so late to the party that when they entered the house it was pitch black and everyone was already passed out drunk on the floor.
ySy8mcceTno,Some scenes from this never happened in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I love how that part at the end with the girl holding something wasn’t even in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,hey today is slenderman movie I'm so excited to watch it
ySy8mcceTno,I'm 10 and I want to see this 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Finally. A genuine looking H O R R O R movie
ySy8mcceTno,That is just the real Scary Movie of this years.
ySy8mcceTno,There's a few scenes in this trailer that weren't even in the movie. Girl never stabbed herself in the eye in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is sh*t
ySy8mcceTno,So now slim people are scary? Man i hate this world we live in.
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie was horrible and half the interesting looking scenes in the trailer were not included in the movie. The movie used the same vertigo effects relentlessly, and it got very repetitive very quickly. The Slenderman character can be done so much better, and a PG-13 non-scary cringefest is not the way to do it."
ySy8mcceTno,0:58 is a spoiler by the way. Its literally at the end.
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer was better than the movie.
And don't do Jeff the killer, it won't work out, trust me"
ySy8mcceTno,About half of the stuff in this trailer wasn’t even in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I get the feeling that this movie is going to be a complete flop and waste of money
ySy8mcceTno,"Boring, why would you take something with shitty source material like this and expect to make a good horror film."
ySy8mcceTno,s h o o k
ySy8mcceTno,"They wanted to air this trailer during The Slender Man Case, Hasn't Payton Leutner suffered enough that somebody in Hollywood wanted to make a movie about this guy?"
ySy8mcceTno,Just saw it 1 hour ago. It really sucked! Not scary at all and no storyline
ySy8mcceTno,"Ehm, the movíe sucked, don't watch it...."
ySy8mcceTno,We need a good high budget Outlast movie.
ySy8mcceTno,You're sexist Sony! Are you implying all man are evil or bad?? Why can't it be Slender Woman? :O
ySy8mcceTno,"So tired of horror movie trailers filled with cliches and no clue as to what the narrative of the film is going to be... I bet there is an annoying amount of jump scares, that's all I can know for sure."
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, it looks more zalgo than slendy"
ySy8mcceTno,Huh?
ySy8mcceTno,"I saw this movie and honestly, it sucked, I don't recommend it to anyone. They included shots in the trailer that's NOT in the movie. Once you guys see it, you will be extremely disappointed lol If you don't believe me, watch it yourself lol"
ySy8mcceTno,HOLY MOLY! 😀 https://youtu.be/hNAGw92-Ejk
ySy8mcceTno,Wwwhack....
ySy8mcceTno,hey 1:29 that one is deleted from the movie
ySy8mcceTno,brah this is chilsss m888
ySy8mcceTno,They should turn a lot of creepy pastas into movies I think the Russian sleep experiement would make a great movie as well as gateway to the mind and Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,im going to see it because i wanted to see it like 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,It’s not even scary at all trust. I saw it last night
ySy8mcceTno,"""people don't just disappear""
*Thanos snaps fingers and wipes out half of the Avengers *"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendrina the movie is next
ySy8mcceTno,Wow... and Hollywood cries to *us* about copyright and fair use?
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,I always get chills when i watch this. I can't wait to see the whole movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"Fair warning, half of the stuff in this trailer isn’t in the movie at all and it’s totally pitiful and nearly unwatchable."
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman that he doesn't actually take and kill  actually takes anyone to help him do Thing that kill anyone for him
ySy8mcceTno,"Where are half the scenes in this trailer? 

In case you were wondering, the last scene of the trailer isnt in the movie, you never see what shes holding"
ySy8mcceTno,They changed the movie so much
ySy8mcceTno,Half of this trailer didn't make the final cut. I just saw the film.
ySy8mcceTno,The loud movie
ySy8mcceTno,If Bendy And The Ink Machine was a movie 🎥🍿
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see what kind of bullshit cinematic franchise this spins-off into.
ySy8mcceTno,HALF OF THE STUFF IN THE TRAILER WASN'T EVEN IN THE MOVIE. ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN. COMPLETE BULLSHIT! WHERE WERE ALL THESE SCENES WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE?
ySy8mcceTno,Sooo...  where were all those good scenes in the movie that was in this trailer...???
ySy8mcceTno,Movie was good. Some stuff in the trailer aren't in the movie tho
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie: Lil tay Strikes again 
Coming to theaters near u 6/6/66"
ySy8mcceTno,"Just saw the movie. The part with the girl stabbing herself in the face isn't in the movie, or the part with the dude jumping from the bridge, or the girl at the end... wtf."
ySy8mcceTno,"Just got back from the movie.  Not the worst movie I’ve seen but not that good.  Way too many special effects, too many noises that killed suspense, bad acting, Slenderman was shown too much, not really scary at all.  It would have been better shot as a low budget (Blair Witch Project style)."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm curious. But what is the plot?
ySy8mcceTno,This is wack nah
ySy8mcceTno,1:33 the reaction from the other girl made me die laughing
ySy8mcceTno,I live in Wisconsin and they are not showing this movie in the city of Milwaukee.
ySy8mcceTno,I just watched it and it sucked. A lot of the scenes that were in the trailer weren’t in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"*let’s summon Slenderman*
Me:
Hell nah, I ain’t bout to die today. I’m out have fun dieing."
ySy8mcceTno,"Just saw the movie. Half the stuff in the trailer, like the girl stabbing herself with the knife in the classroom, and the part at the end with the girl with the bloodied mouth...wasn’t even in the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Well... Is this any good?Or another jumpscare fest?
ySy8mcceTno,So hyped its finally out
ySy8mcceTno,i had a bit of hope for the movie until i saw the sony logo
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie exists because of the character “Nergal” in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.
ySy8mcceTno,give me 20$
ySy8mcceTno,"Congratulations, “Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story.” You’re no longer the worst Slender Man-based movie."
ySy8mcceTno,All i wanted was a scp movie is THAT too much to ask
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone is so quick to say this movie is bad give it a chance
ySy8mcceTno,"well... i sugest to watch Marble Hornets... also whats with the bell and baby noises? looks more like a generic hollywood horror flick than a propper approach on the operator. But hey, maybe I'm wrong."
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for Creepypasta: The Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see this movie so bad
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 oof
ySy8mcceTno,"I've known this legend for years. I've read so many different versions of his story, and I've read the original. I have been simply waiting on a movie. I am extremely excited to see it, but I see a tiny, but perfectly okay, mistake. His name. His name isn't two words; it's just one. It's Slenderman. Not Slender Man. Its okay, I just thought I'd point it out. I am very aware that putting in my two cents isn't necessarily going to matter in any way, shape, or form. I just wanted to clarify a little bit. I'm excited to watch it, and am completely convinced already that this is going to be an amazing movie, representation, and story of the Slenderman. 😆"
ySy8mcceTno,I.im going to beg my mom to bring me tomorrow bc that’s when it is out
ySy8mcceTno,AHHHH YESSS I WANT A LAZARI MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim no I cannot because I am blind
ySy8mcceTno,"Normally, I love the Slenderman story, but this just looks like crap."
ySy8mcceTno,"there are waaaaayyy scarier creepypastas, if they had to make a movie of one."
ySy8mcceTno,"What exactly is the point of these 3 second intros? It seems like an announcement for the trailer, but we’re already watching it in a couple seconds so it really doesn’t make any sense why it’s there"
ySy8mcceTno,"0:44, oh well done. If you slow it down to 0.5 (or even slower) you can see that it's either a girl closing the door or a man with very long hair. *Good...Effects..*"
ySy8mcceTno,EPIC EPIC EPIC
ySy8mcceTno,I wish they used slenders lullaby as the song in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,*HOW IS THIS PG-13???!!!!!!*
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks for directly spoiling that the black girl dies. Guess it's not like anyone would watch it to find that out for themselves anyways.
ySy8mcceTno,"Omg I want to see it and can ya’ll make a granny movie or a slendrina one please!
Btw I watching this at night"
ySy8mcceTno,"If this movie is a success, next comes a Five Nights at Freddy's movie."
ySy8mcceTno,That looks like hot garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"""Stories of the Slender Man commonly feature him stalking, abducting or traumatizing people, particularly children."" So a horror film about a pedophile?"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm hyping
ySy8mcceTno,Why MAKE A MOVIE NOW
ySy8mcceTno,well............this is not needed
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,Was this made is suicide forest
ySy8mcceTno,Wup  die woo. This has nothing to do with the game. Its like Far cry the movie or postel.
ySy8mcceTno,"It appears that they'll go for making the Slenderman more of a lovecraftian entity, keeping him in the shadows and slowly driving those he affects insane.

I do hope that I'm correct."
ySy8mcceTno,"What else is gonna be next, Probably, MEME the movie, Micky Mouse vs Peppa Pig, Yee vs Nyan Cat #iwouldloveYeevsNyanCatXD"
ySy8mcceTno,YASS
ySy8mcceTno,I'm excited to see this!
ySy8mcceTno,This made me so happy I don’t live near any woods
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome I can wait 😁
ySy8mcceTno,Why hello 2012 I didn't see you there

ySy8mcceTno,fortnite: infinity war
ySy8mcceTno,what age rating is it??
ySy8mcceTno,6 years after it kicked off
ySy8mcceTno,Sony should just give up on movies already
ySy8mcceTno,LIKE AND PIN IF YOURE READY FOR SPOOPS
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if one part of the movie has any sort of resemblance to the incident that happened in 2014..
ySy8mcceTno,"This is outdated--didn't the movie get canceled and redone altogether?

Also, not sticking to the sources given Sony, and there are plenty of sources :/"
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look good.
ySy8mcceTno,Go back to making computers Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,"Like I said for the new one.






To little to late."
ySy8mcceTno,"Pokemon Crimson: The Movie
The secret of Disney: The Movie
The Stingray Project: The Movie
NES Godzilla Creepypasta: The Movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else glad that there’s finally a movie about a creepypasta?
ySy8mcceTno,Another stupid one....
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is dum
ySy8mcceTno,im scared
ySy8mcceTno,Your to late sony the pasta    Expired six years
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like they're completely changing the way the original Creepypasta and game went. Kinda disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,bookey
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't tell me this is an adult movie I really wanna watch this 😭
ySy8mcceTno,"THE SMOKE AT 0:48 IM CRYINGGGGGGG

ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy I can't wait for the SCP movie after this!
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 No. Just no.
ySy8mcceTno,finally a fucking movie!!!! hell yeah
ySy8mcceTno,SALAAADD FINGAASS
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman directed and starred in this movie. He is very proud of himself. :)
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Task: missing friend
Solution: try witchcraft
Yeah, solution checks out.

So this is The Ring for millennials?

This trailer should have completed at about the 2 minute mark. It felt like 1.5 trailers were hacked together."
ySy8mcceTno,"Originally from a game...




So Sony didn't care and decided to make a movie out of slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man 
Slender Man 
Does whatever a Slender Man Does 
Can he scare you away 
Yes he can
He's a man 
Look out he's the Slender Man"
ySy8mcceTno,Joey King's a cutie so...yeah.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, Don't say, Dont think it."
ySy8mcceTno,"Me and my Bf is going to watch it on the 18th,since we have school,and I’m kinda scared😳"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender's becoming popular again? Best day ever
ySy8mcceTno,Oi
ySy8mcceTno,Horor movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this remind me so much of the Video tape on The Ring?
ySy8mcceTno,It would be much cool doing Logan Paul cameo and he laughs at a hunged body lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Yikes a 8% Rotten Tomatoes rating? Yeah, I can see in the future."
ySy8mcceTno,The original Slender game was released almost 6-years ago. Why does it deserve a movie now? The Slenderman fad is over and has been over for a while. If Sony were trying to make a quick buck don’t you think they should’ve made the film years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,My fav actor plays as slender man
ySy8mcceTno,That's was one of the most cliche-filled trailers I've ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,8 years late but still very welcome.
ySy8mcceTno,#6YearsTooLate! Oof...
ySy8mcceTno,Please do a Five Nights of Freddy's FULL LORE/ Full storyline movie
ySy8mcceTno,wins splendorman ;v
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,wtf why did they make a movie about a thoses two girls where one of them killed the other one for not believing slenderman is real smh
ySy8mcceTno,"For those of you who are wondering if he's real. he has been completely disproved. The whole Slender story and game base were based off of a picture that was photoshopped together for a contest. He is *NOT* real. If you kill someone for him, he will *NOT* take you to wherever you think he lives to be a ""proxy"" (To my knowledge everyone believes he lives in a mansion). Children can be tried as adults, which means you could get life sentances, if you murder someone. The two girls that stabbed someone over him, will most likely see most of the rest of their lives in mental institutions, after their pleid of insanity worked. Please do NOT act on your beliefs of the Slender Man,. he has been proven false, just by doing a little research. For the origin of the picture that made him, he was created for a horror picture photoshop contest on the Something Awful forums."
ySy8mcceTno,"Am I the only one that thinks this is in extremely poor taste, after that girl was stabbed over this creepypasta? Or has it been long enough that we've forgotten about that?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I have made a LEGO version of the second trailer, please check it out"
ySy8mcceTno,First of all I feel like this takes away slender mans original character and also this movie is way too late
ySy8mcceTno,Who else it reminds for Ring?
ySy8mcceTno,😵😭😅😲
ySy8mcceTno,Based on a true story
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,I saw this movie was coming soon when I went to see Infinity War I didn't think it would be THAT scary
ySy8mcceTno,its about time
ySy8mcceTno,*smh*
ySy8mcceTno,"Is that Ian somerhalder saying ""where is my daughter"" I think it is."
ySy8mcceTno,"the movies over..people are getting up......then screams are heard, they sound like a young boy. Then the screen goes black. then they show  cut cheaks and pale smile... ""Jeff the Killer:2019"
ySy8mcceTno,I think this actually looks pretty good and the trailer itself scared me but I don’t like how they’re basing a big part of it off of the real event.
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer was boring.... doesn't give me much hope for the film.
ySy8mcceTno,Zzz
ySy8mcceTno,i thought slender man never made noise except the static noise
ySy8mcceTno,The story bases on slenderman is he thought his family died so he killed him self and started a curse and its acuttaly Realy sad.
ySy8mcceTno,"Man, I wanted it to be a Marble Horntets Slender movie, not this trash"
ySy8mcceTno,"I cant wait for ""Do you know da wae: A Knuckles story"" Its slated for release in 2086. But boy oh boy im happier than a blue jay eatin' a catfish head."
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be a really bad movie  . It could be way better
ySy8mcceTno,This does not remind me of slender what so ever. It reminds me of stranger things.
ySy8mcceTno,"I laughed so much at this. They even failed to scare me with the jump scare, the easiest method of scarring people there is."
ySy8mcceTno,Any1 know if this will be out in Ireland? Looks semi ok
ySy8mcceTno,My God I've never been so bored... And that's pretty scary.
ySy8mcceTno,This had me screaming
ySy8mcceTno,I'm going with my dad the day it comes out 😊😊😊😊
ySy8mcceTno,The only scene that holds true to what slender is about is the clip where he teleports. All of the sound effects are misplaced. The silence of Slender is what makes him scary. The moment they decided not to make this from a handheld perspective they lost. You know he's around without seeing him because of camera tracking glitches. It's in the game and all the online videos..... Cloverfield 1 did handheld just fine. Guess they are feigning artistic integrity.

ySy8mcceTno,you know despite how bad this movie looks I feel like slender man is a good example of what we find scary in modern day life he is faceless because of our fear of the unknown and he is a stalker and you cant say you havnt been paranoid that someone was following you. the monsters we fear now arnt deformed abominations but other humans that are a little different
ySy8mcceTno,1 fear slender man and look at this movie 😨😖

I mean, I know there has been other Wannabee movies, that btw, again in my opinion sucked. Only because the budget really wasn't there truthfully. I personally think this may very well turn out pretty good, and unexpectedly great. (Hopefully.) Especially, when you have a Budget from Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Does it really look like a movie of slenderman lol
ySy8mcceTno,That movie needs to be pulled out of theaters now

ySy8mcceTno,I might've considered watching if it was 2013 when this came out. A.k.a the year i still cared about slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Who's idea was this
ySy8mcceTno,*I am actually surprised at the fact that this movie is not entirely based around the Slender Man stabbings that happened in Wisconsin.*
ySy8mcceTno,"Please don't make slenderman talk, make noises, have feelings, or really move that much.
The scary part of slenderman is just is unsettling appearances and stares. He is the unkown. Don't tell us how he works, or show us how he takes people. Don't give him a home.
Make it ominous, please. Just unsettling - no jumpscare bullshit, slenderman is the opposite of that."

They made a movie of this creepypasta?
What's next? Smiley dog, Eyeless Jack, Jeff the killer...."
ySy8mcceTno,"Bit late to the party Hollywood, slender man is fkn old as hell now"
ySy8mcceTno,"At first, when I saw this trailer, I was hesitant. ""Scary unrelated imagery is scary cliché"" and whatnot. The goal and story of this movie wasn't too clear, either. It seemed like a generic horror movie rather than a story about the Slenderman. And that upset me a little. I also grew to know the Slenderman creature from Marble Hornets, and how it affects people. (Yes, I know he's actually called The Operator in that series, but I didn't want to confuse everyone.) From this trailer, I went ""Slenderman doesn't make people kill themselves."" ""Slenderman doesn't normally choose random victims"" ""Slenderman usually playa with his victims more."" Now, watching the second trailer, I feel like I can piece some of this together, even setting aside what I know from good ol' Troy Wagner. The Slenderman inthis film didn't seem to choose his victims at random, which is good. Fir whatever reason, I feel like that first girl was a bigger part of the story. Also, no. Slenderman doesn't make people just kill themselves. Which is why I One: think they were close to the missing girl, which is proved in the second trailer, and Two: I think they did it willingly. To get away from the Slender Sickness (which we'll get too). I think it drove them insane and they couldn't handle it anymore.
Putting aside how Marble Hornets as a whole series operares, I feel like this movie could be really really good. They have their own way with dealing with stuff, like the slender sickness or whatnot. 

Also, another theory. That girl that we see in the hospital or whatever, screaming? She's already seen the Slenderman, and is going a little bit crazy. Of course, the doctors don't know that and they're just trying to calm her down. What if they effectively get her out of the sickness, almost like Tim's pills (for Marble Hornets fans)? She then either gets a new identity or just moves on, until most of the events in this film take place. She sees the Slenderman online, and then all of a sudden, she remembers. She tries to summon him, but it remembers her. And now it's pissed and wants her. It wants the one that got away. 
That would explain the whole ""Slenderman doesn't take random people"", and then of course her friends get involved and in turn bring it upon them.

So Slendy now is a demon that once you have an encounter with him, it controls your body? Where did I miss that in all those videogames.
You know what? I'm not an expert of making horror movies but I think, this movie could have been beet if were recorded like the Blair witch project. A found footage, a person recording everything, maybe not from the beginning of the movie, instead when they get into the forest, from there, but not too cringe or stupid like in paranormal activity. At least it would keep the essence of the original Slenderman"

ySy8mcceTno,Let the bad acting begin
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they’re making a legit Slender Man movie
ySy8mcceTno,I am really mad that they have thought of the idea of making this movie.  I mean yea some people might like it but I’m from a city where a really bad case happen years ago and it just horrible. I mean what if the victim saw this movie she going to be traumatized even more than before. Again this is just my opinion on this movie. Everyone has their own
ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap this is a thing
ySy8mcceTno,Um this movie is 2 weeks away and we only have one trailer u know sony comic Con was last weekend it would have been a great time to release a trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Is this based off of those girls who stabbed their best friend in order to impress a fictional creepypasta character
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer em Movie slender man :O
ySy8mcceTno,Esse filme vai ser foda!
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is soooo... good!

I really want to watch it!"
ySy8mcceTno,At least Slender doesn't have to worry about putting on weight.
ySy8mcceTno,Cómo tergiversan todo🙄
ySy8mcceTno,After you just went camping at Yosemite 😂
ySy8mcceTno,I love creepy pasta movies
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t Slenderman suck ur soul out of You
ySy8mcceTno,i think its fake were is the date for it
ySy8mcceTno,I’m for sure seeing this
ySy8mcceTno,1:27 bottom right
ySy8mcceTno,Next November creepy pastas the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not going to sleep tonight
ySy8mcceTno,someone please make a meme edit where at 1:41 instead of slenderman its howard the alien
ySy8mcceTno,"It kinda looks generic, it’s lacking the uniqueness of something like marble hornets,tribe twelve, or any of the other slenderverse series."
ySy8mcceTno,its rated PG-13
ySy8mcceTno,First slender man just wait a year or two and there’ll be amnesia and other games that released over five years ago that no one cares about anymore
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be awesome
ySy8mcceTno,The Eight Pages.
ySy8mcceTno,White people in horror movies smh
ySy8mcceTno,They’re probably gonna make a herobrine movie too 😂 he was also created on creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,OKAY MEMES HAVE GONE TOO FAR
ySy8mcceTno,People are replying to comments saying “if u don’t have anything good to say don’t say anything”.  WELL THEN THERE WOULD BE NO COMMENTS 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Joey Kingggggggggg 💞
ySy8mcceTno,1:40 probably in every horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,Because I’m HYPED to see it if they make it PG-13 rated
ySy8mcceTno,Does anybody know when this movie comes out?
ySy8mcceTno,I just can't believe how stupid people are. The game and even the Creepypast has almost no plot. And you guys think they would be able to adapt a girl collecting pages into a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,@idubbbztv
ySy8mcceTno,I love the slender man
ySy8mcceTno,A little bit late i remember when the trailer released
ySy8mcceTno,meow

ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait I love slender man
ySy8mcceTno,😨😨😨😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks like it will set a very dreadful mood. If the movie is as cinematic as the trailer, it should be a good one"
ySy8mcceTno,Pokemon GO the movie coming soon IRL :P
ySy8mcceTno,Joey King is in that movie!
ySy8mcceTno,This movie’s gonna suck!
ySy8mcceTno,Well this might be a movie that makes the game seem more creepier.
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone here from Joey kings insta?
ySy8mcceTno,OMG SLENDRINA >-<
ySy8mcceTno,How much does everyone wanna bet that it will be based on pure speculation rather than the actual lore?
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Eu não vi o Slender Man o trailer inteiro
ySy8mcceTno,Meu god mais um filme de terror mas e do SLENDER MAN!!! Cara minha irmã Se A Susta Muito Poh
ySy8mcceTno,"Ur already 4 years late
Just make ur movie and go"
ySy8mcceTno,This is probably the most inaccurate portrayal of SlenderMan I have ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,"You cant see slender man





SLENDER MAN =JOHN CENA CONFIRMED"
ySy8mcceTno,hmmmm.. dont think we need to bother with this one. Nothing here sais unique at all
ySy8mcceTno,You could’ve made this simple and just did a live action eight pages thing. But no you always gotta be extra af
ySy8mcceTno,where's 2nd trailer
ySy8mcceTno,You're like 6 years late guys.
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to my party! 🎉
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie: LigMa, the plague"
ySy8mcceTno,It would be cool if they have the song “Centuries” by fall out boy in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,We need a new trailer😒 people is forgetting about this
ySy8mcceTno,I've been looking for a SECOND TRAILER for this movie for the past mouths..... and nothing
ySy8mcceTno,I wish they made a movie of Ticci Toby instead.
ySy8mcceTno,"I just realized this movie was directed by the same man who directed  I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer, and that's very disappointing."
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie:
The rake august 8th 2019"
ySy8mcceTno,When Will this come out
ySy8mcceTno,i want to know if this movie is going to be R rated
ySy8mcceTno,"1:51
Slenderman: Hello? Is it me you're looking for?"
ySy8mcceTno,they need to make a CREPPY pasta movie with all of them including Ani wight
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this moment for a REALLY long time now. And it's about time they make a movie about the slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"2:03 thats a stock sound ma boi
Is this directed by the guy who wrote the creepypasta btw? woud be pretty epic"
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell?
ySy8mcceTno,My fayvory horro is slenderman and chakey doll
ySy8mcceTno,Omg cool movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Why couldn't they just make the movie around the style of slender the arrival, and made the film style based off first person like Blair witch"
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderinaman
ySy8mcceTno,"Guess whats next
2019: jeff the killer
2020:candle cove
2021:Russian sleep experiment

ySy8mcceTno,This shits never coming out lmao.

ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets really just did it best man...
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie: Smiley 
Cumming soon October 2020"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, lets hope you don’t live up to your reputation this time."
ySy8mcceTno,"Coming soon?
Coming when??????"
ySy8mcceTno,IM SO HYPE FOR THIS MOVIE NOONE UNDERSTANDS!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,when does this come out
ySy8mcceTno,It feel like it keeps repeating the same thing slender slender SLENDER
ySy8mcceTno,"What happens if Sony makes a creepypasta universe, where they release slenderman film and Jeff the killer movie and they crossover to fight."
ySy8mcceTno,"Esto ubiera estado algo ""bien"" si la ubieran planeado para el 2013 o incluso el 2014, ademas espero que esté basada en el Creepypasta porque no creo que sea una buena idea hacer una película basada en recojer hojas xdxd"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh nooooooo noooooo noooo !!#
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is so fake
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean, they have all of marble hornets to steal from, an amazing slenderman series that shows how creepy and subtle the character and world could be....so why did they make generic ooga booga stuff instead? Good movie developers are dumb these days"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not watching this because it seems very cliché. All these movies are just a little alike. They don't try hard to make what's supposed to be scary scary. it's the suspenseful music. the hallucinations. then the bad guy comes. screams, crappy attempts to kill. person gets away. person falls. killer walks slowly. always. it's never like real life. why don't they think ""what if the slender man was real? what if people actual believed he's real, and were scared? what exactly are his intentions and how would he plan it?"" and anyone they tell about what's going on never believes them."
ySy8mcceTno,1:20 me while watching the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,ahhhh am already scared but still tho i wanna see the movie
ySy8mcceTno,#partiu ver
ySy8mcceTno,I will tell my gf this is a superhero movie :)))

ySy8mcceTno,"*Next movie: *SPOON KILLER* .... staring the Rock, as SpoonVictim. (only man strong enough to beat SpoonGhost)"
ySy8mcceTno,Blind people  win slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"On one hand this looks pretty bad, unless it turns out to be a really well made pstchological horror, like The Babadook. On the other hand I'm impressed how this photoshop competition went to having stories on the internet then a fan made game on it, then to having a sort of cult following and having fan made movies and such. Then that murder that happened which I mean I know there are people that truely believe this stuff. is true now its practically a house hold name. The internets crazy."
ySy8mcceTno,Seem to be real Legend.
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for Jeff the killer and BEN Drowned
ySy8mcceTno,Why am I watching this in the dark?
ySy8mcceTno,Spainder man

ySy8mcceTno,"Okay the trailer is already missing the whole atmosphere of the original creepypasta, not a lot of hope for the movie... oh boi i can't wait to make my own movies with actual research and understanding of the whole fandom. This is suppose to be Art, not a way to make way to much fucking money."

ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim HELL NO I DONT WANNA BEING STALK ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,0:25 hasn't seen enough stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Is this supposed to be based off the murders or what?
ySy8mcceTno,The teaser trailer made no sense for me but the trailer explains more
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s the suit and tie Sony? Where’s the class???
ySy8mcceTno,their not even getting the fucking story right
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer doesn’t tell what the strory from the movie is
ySy8mcceTno,"i want slenderman to be my daddy

ySy8mcceTno,"1:07
If she's writing with a marker like that,
 you know she's gone insane"
ySy8mcceTno,0:43 and the scariest part of it all: the fanart.
ySy8mcceTno,I seriously thought this movie was never going to come out. I hope it's not just a bunch of jump-scares I would like to actually be based off of the freaking Creepypasta. Okay the FNAF movie that can have jump scares okay that's fine because that's what Five Nights of Freddy's basically is.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony Timeline:

ySy8mcceTno,Great idea to make a slender man movie but the trailer is making the movie its self look terrible. Where's slenderman? I mean seriously he gets no screen time here. What is this? some girl getting possessed by a demon or is this slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,*¡Spoiler Alert!* it's gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,"2 questions


1: did they cancel this

2: is it pg-13 or r because if it is pg-13 it would be even worse"
ySy8mcceTno,calling it right now this is either going to do really fucking good or its going to be absolute garbage

ySy8mcceTno,Why does this exist?
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry Sony you’re 5 years late to the party
ySy8mcceTno,When is it gonna come out?
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone ever thought that the creator of SlenderMan went into Hot Topics one day and sawJack Skellington and said: ""I want my character to look like that creature, but I can't use his name."""
ySy8mcceTno,"When's the movie coming out ffs? And if it's out already, why can't i find it on any film streaming website?"

ySy8mcceTno,"Wow! Like 2 or 3 years ago two 12 year olds tried to kill a classmate because, ""Slenderman told them to.""
Were we supposed to forget that? It's totally messed up that Sony would get this garbage going again! I guess they don't care about our kids. Sony should be held liable if anymore kids get hurt or have psychotic breaks from this garbage. 
SHAME ON SONY!"

ySy8mcceTno,😨
ySy8mcceTno,"I agree with every one that this movie should of been made 5 years ago when Slender was still very popular
Then I remembered that around 5 years ago 2 girls try to kill their friend saying they were doing it to appease Slender
If tgis came out 5 years ago meny people would try to stop them from making it
Infact the father of one of the girls made a petition to stop this movie from being made becuase he think the same thing will happen again with diffrent people
How stupid does he think we are?
It his fault his kid try to murder some one not slender"

ySy8mcceTno,It could be better.
ySy8mcceTno,Granny the movie in 2666
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope he at least got to use his tendrils in the film, also he seems to have lost his PRIME quality:

Sophistication, or at least some form of macabre professionalism has always been the cornerstone of slender dating back to the something awful forums. This alone sets him apart from monsters and maniacs as he is a f_____ up gentlemen.

If I want to see ""the unstoppable monster"" in a film I watch ""Alien"", should I prefer an occult scare I watch ""The Exorcist"". This film should show slender as a villain, not a monster. Without it the uniqueness is lost and the film becomes a cash-grab."
ySy8mcceTno,Is like a dream coming true but I still wish Jeff the killer the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I will give this movie a watch see if its good or not.
ySy8mcceTno,"It like Channel Zero
But worst
And a movie"

ySy8mcceTno,*Can't wait for the Smile dog movie*
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer 2 Please?
ySy8mcceTno,Coming out summer 2039
ySy8mcceTno,After what happened in 2013 they are idiots to make this movie!🤦‍♀️
ySy8mcceTno,From the fist scene I was creeped out
ySy8mcceTno,Is this really fake or true? Since i've seen many fake things in my life.
ySy8mcceTno,#Canyouseehim?
ySy8mcceTno,I am now satisfied 😈
ySy8mcceTno,"It should be called invisible Man.he's barely in the trailer.

Shitty trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,😯😯😯😱😱😱

This is hurtful."
ySy8mcceTno,Coll
ySy8mcceTno,"My friend told me about this, and I thought I was a joke."
ySy8mcceTno,"It's funny how depending of how much you actually know of the Slender Man, you'll think this movie is gonna be horrible or actually good. There are many things in this trailer that resemble things of the Slender Man mythos and Victor Surge (The creator of Slender Man) is writting this movie, so I have my hopes up for it. The collecting pages bullshit was just from the game and Slender Man didn't originate form it. Do some research people. Also, the character didn't stop existing 5 years ago you know?"
ySy8mcceTno,2:14
ySy8mcceTno,Wait he is coming because at the end it said coming soon to kill us
ySy8mcceTno,"The only thing I wanna see is those girls getting killed,hah,classic :D"
ySy8mcceTno,Nerd
ySy8mcceTno,I hate PlayStation
ySy8mcceTno,Is that a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Poor slendy all he wanted was a friend
ySy8mcceTno,2:03 That’s a fucking baby cry. That’s from a YouTube video. JESUS THIS MOVIE IS LAZY
ySy8mcceTno,This worries me. But I like the imagery of the worms. Worms are a physical parasite that represents how the Slenderman is a psychological parasite.
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like they tried way too hard, and I'd never guess this was a slender movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Can we PLEASE get the FNAF movie going, because I would rather watch THAT than this overly cliche horror film."
ySy8mcceTno,Coming up next: Fortnite The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,I want an OUTLAST movie now
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't remember this from the games , I thought I was lost in a spooky forest with a tall faceless man in a suit with long limbs and tentacles then you go around and eight ominous pages. Man, slender has changed"
ySy8mcceTno,SOOOO HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,"What is the ""age rating"" of the film? 12,16,18?"
ySy8mcceTno,Isnt slender man in a suit..and dosent he hang his victims in sides from a tree?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender-man game comes out....they should make this into a movie that would be sooo funnyyy
ySy8mcceTno,"Dateee,pliz"
ySy8mcceTno,is this even the trailer this looks like a trailer for something different but i just looked at it again and it is the trailer for Slender Man I can't wait for this movie to come out.
ySy8mcceTno,They must find the eight pages
ySy8mcceTno,2030: SCP The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,"They should honestly just make a whole creepy pasta movie with all the creepy pasta , and make it to where slender created them all by taking them I know THATS NOT HOW THEY WHERE MADE but it would be cool . Maybe add rules jack , Jeff , Toby , hoodie and masky , and Sally ."
ySy8mcceTno,I bet next is granny
ySy8mcceTno,Please this movie release in Hindi
ySy8mcceTno,When does this movie begin
ySy8mcceTno,He really seems to hate eyes
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is just killing it in 2018.
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer seems awkward, cliche, and generally bad, hopefully it’s good, but by the looks of it, it’s probably gonna be terrible, there’s so much things in this trailer that are just random squirmy things that don’t make sense at all. Horror movies should try and scare people, but they should still make sense and have an interesting story."
ySy8mcceTno,I really wished they could make a movie out of the game slender the arrival
ySy8mcceTno,Bobo terra next is the rake october 5 2028
ySy8mcceTno,I got to say when slender man opens his mouth (idk if he could XD) he kind of looks like venom
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,It says coming soon but where it at then
ySy8mcceTno,Ok so here's one thing I'm worried about... Because Sony is making this a movie does that mean I can't write a book involving him? It wasn't going to be just about slender it was going to involve all of the proxies and of of of mine... I was going to sell it. Now slenderman is an urban legend so can you copywrite and own an urban legend? If I write this book and sell it will I get flippin sued by Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Alta bosta
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this?
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh great, not Sony...."

ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is just Sinister mixed with The Happening. Where's my Academy Award?

ySy8mcceTno,"Random man: *Where's my daughter? People couldn't just disappear...*
Me: ._. When you try to convince yourself Slender Man hasn't got his butt back up."
ySy8mcceTno,"all i gotta say is ""hell naw"" (@_@)"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm still thinking that they'll add a Jeff The Killer Easter egg in the middle or the end of the movie. Like have a Police Station receive a call of that one survivor who faced Jeff himself. Just describing how he looked or whatever. Probably not even half of the Theater will get the reference honestly.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman slenderman!
ySy8mcceTno,ok

ySy8mcceTno,Noss ess filme vai ser muito bom man slk n vejo a hora de assistir legendado
ySy8mcceTno,"if sony look at this, please do not ruin the character or the story or the movie in general, please make a good story and attach the slender character as in the story with suit, high and white skin, no agan aga noises animals he does not sound like a lion also agan that appears in the movie not only in 2 or 3 essences if it would not make sense to try to be a great successe."

ySy8mcceTno,Should've been made atleast 4 years ago fam
ySy8mcceTno,This looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Just by the trailer I can tell they took a lot of creative liberties 😒
ySy8mcceTno,Why now! Why not make this movie when Slendy was a big trend?
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta Cinematic Universe
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t think that film is gonna work, Instead of calling it Slender man why can’t they call it, Look away, It stalks you or Something instead of Slender man because it’s too easy to figure out what the movie is called, I think the film needs to save a lot more money and put good casting members."
ySy8mcceTno,When is this movie coming out?!?! I need to see it!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I knew he was real no one believed me, they all thought I was crazy I saw him, I've seen him, now here's proof hahahahahhahahahaha"

ySy8mcceTno,"It looks like a 6-8 kinda film 

Rating wise"
ySy8mcceTno,"The anticipation in seeing the movie is killing me. Many people are exited because they enjoyed the game or the story. Some people just simply don’t care about this sort of stuff. I’m just interested in seeing it because of my grandpa is from Germany and ever since me and my siblings were little, we were told about Der Großmann and how he took away kids who misbehaved. (Until I heard and done research on what Slenderman was) )WARNING DARK) I was also told about a German man back in Germany named Karl Großmann who cannibilied is victims. Committed assault and child molestation. This is just my input  toward the movie. Sorry if you disagree and cool if you found it interesting. I appreciate who ever actually read all of this. :3"
ySy8mcceTno,this movie looks about as scary as my right foot they really should of jumped on this train sooner. Also why call it slender man that just kinda ruins it
ySy8mcceTno,Promete
ySy8mcceTno,That trailer really didn't give much of anything away. Come back after watching the trailer with close to the same knowledge about the movie that I had prior.
ySy8mcceTno,wtF.U.C.K is SLENDER MAN?! Smh  BORRRRRNNNGGGGGGGG (yawn)
ySy8mcceTno,nesse filme aparece tudo menos o slender
ySy8mcceTno,Slender The Arrival was so much better
ySy8mcceTno,How about after the stabbing we not capitalize Sleder? That girl had to live through so much pain and she survived.
ySy8mcceTno,I forgot about slender and i was happy i was scared to go to sleep thanks i do want this to come it out on dvd
ySy8mcceTno,horror
ySy8mcceTno,Nigga sound at 1:56
ySy8mcceTno,Five nights at Freddy's or candle cove
ySy8mcceTno,I'm just waiting for the _Blender Man_ Horror Comedy that is sure to follow...
ySy8mcceTno,Ok...so....yea what
ySy8mcceTno,S
ySy8mcceTno,i thought this was a fake trailer but its not
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna watch it badly
ySy8mcceTno,Is this movie dead. What the hell happened to it?
ySy8mcceTno,"Hoody,masky,or ticci toby anyone?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendrina
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this isn't one of those movies where we all go to see Slender Man, but never actually see Slender Man"
ySy8mcceTno,Yawn.
ySy8mcceTno,is there even a plot lmao
ySy8mcceTno,why is the scariest thing the internet can think of a tall white man??
ySy8mcceTno,Going to be flop.
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone know the release date yet?
ySy8mcceTno,"All seriousness though, this looks very promising as a horror movie. It gives off the impression that this isn't a movie that is gonna rely on jump scares because it has disturbing imagery and very dark themes. Modern horror movies these days seem to want to just get your heart pumping with what they think is fear but is really just anticipation for those few jump scares and that's it while THIS movie seems to want to carve a horrifying image into your brain and leave you having sleepless nights. 

This looks good. Lets e open minded and give it a shot"
ySy8mcceTno,Someone better give him 20 dollars.
ySy8mcceTno,"I used to be obsessed with Slender man. I don’t like how the movie leaves the forest part/ exploring pages part out because that is like the MAIN part of slender man. So basically the main plot of the movie is if you see a tall white man, commit suicide."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man low key didn’t WANT to be in this movie, but they bribed him with children!"
ySy8mcceTno,So wait is slender man in movie going act like hive mind virus like what the description of the video said?
ySy8mcceTno,It would be amazing if this movie had Kate in it... Doubt it tho
ySy8mcceTno,ii
ySy8mcceTno,Where's slendrina
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sure you will find Slenderman in every scene if you look hard enough.
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, Baldis Basics in Education and Learning movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the sonic.exe movie in 2024
ySy8mcceTno,I've seen Slenderman before he is real people do not say he is fake because he is real I've nearly died coming from him before I can't talk about this anymore if you want to hear more to get my YouTube channel and Sarah Downs d o w n es

ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for this movie forever.
ySy8mcceTno,When does it come out?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man had 3 seconds of screen time
ySy8mcceTno,"I'll be extremely disappointed if they don't play ""Give me 20$ Dollars"" at least in the end credits."
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer turned out to be more cringey than what Ive ever imagined
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man vs Pennywise? Who would win?
ySy8mcceTno,The fathom fan made movie looks way better
ySy8mcceTno,The reaaaally shouldn’t have named the movie “slender man” literally nobody’s gonna take it seriously.😂
ySy8mcceTno,why am I watching this
ySy8mcceTno,"I think the slender man is trying to communicate with them, I just know it! I hope, he finds what he's looking for. Mr. Slenders."
ySy8mcceTno,"Have you guys noticed something? Slender gets kids, IT gets kids, and parinormal activity 4 got kids! What’s next!?!?"
ySy8mcceTno,i wouldnt be surprised if slenderman only appears near the end of the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my God
ySy8mcceTno,We need jeff the killer next and then have a slenderman vs jeff

ySy8mcceTno,"I love how your all complaining about the fact she's not getting the pages, when I first heard of this accordingly there was an art gallery.

In the game Slender you get the pages to find clues of your friend, if the pages weren't there Slender would come after you regardless. The forest is his territory."
ySy8mcceTno,I really thought this was off-limits.
ySy8mcceTno,I hate the end😞
ySy8mcceTno,Sony makes everything look like a masterpiece of quality
ySy8mcceTno,It not to scary but I still wanted to watch it. Can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,You're about 3-5 years too late sony....
ySy8mcceTno,No thanks

ySy8mcceTno,"The comments section is probably the worst place to get info, but what is the Slender Man? I've heard a lot about this horror guy a lot lately, but where does he stem from? Is he from a movie I haven't seen or something?"
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s not be so negative even if it is late maybe this’ll revive creepypasta . Or at least it’ll die on big screen instead of as the fan girl trash it is now

ySy8mcceTno,Honestly i rather not watch movie like these cause slenderman has a really sad back story about his wife and daughter if they make other creepypasta storys im not gonna watch them cause i get memories of how sad the backstory is
ySy8mcceTno,"New super hero , MCU"
ySy8mcceTno,It's been five months. Where is the next trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,But doesnt he stop moving if you stare at him?
ySy8mcceTno,After all these years they make a slender man movie. This will be a little scary but really cool
ySy8mcceTno,2:12 - 0:59
ySy8mcceTno,Payton Lautner probably still has nightmares of that horrific event. Hollywood loves cashing in on the victims and spitting in their faces.
ySy8mcceTno,I Wonder If Markiplier Will An Appearance In This...
ySy8mcceTno,it's already late 15 years late
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a movie trying so hard to be scary .... Sony where is uncharted movie goes
ySy8mcceTno,kinds affect the children so poor
ySy8mcceTno,Has the release date been revealed yet?
ySy8mcceTno,"This could be interesting... But then it leads to a question. Are we about to see a Creepypasta/ Hornets universe emerge if this movie is successful? I think it might be difficult to tie all of them into the same universe, minus the CPs that directly mention Slender in their original story/lore. Either way, I suppose it's a waiting game."

ySy8mcceTno,i love the slenderman legend and want to see this movie but i have a bad feeling about them making a movie and having it focus on he gets in your head crap and not really him
ySy8mcceTno,omg  AMAZING

""What, a Slender man movie? Hollywood really is running out of ideas"" -Joey from Yugioh

If you dont understand this^ joke I just made then thats more reason that you shouldn't watch this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Caralho
ySy8mcceTno,SPOOKY
ySy8mcceTno,I'm scared
ySy8mcceTno,WTF!! They surely copied that scene with the girl screaming in the hospital bed looking at the roof from another movie!!! Can anyone remind me what movie is it? Boogeyman?
ySy8mcceTno,And there’s no Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I think that a Slenderman movie could actually be pretty great, under the right circumstances,

But seeing this trailer, which contains every horror movie cliche imaginable, there can be no doubt in my mind that this is going to suck."
ySy8mcceTno,Screen Gems. Oh boy.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm a star!
ySy8mcceTno,roblox coming soon 2045
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon: Baldi's basics
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this movie will be really good. Markiplier got me obsessed with the games. So I hope the movie wont be a disappointment. Cause I'm really looking forward to watching it.

ySy8mcceTno,I bet you he's only gonna come out 1 time in the movie and that's the ending
ySy8mcceTno,"The Elder Scrolls told of the return. The defeat was mearly a delay. Until the time oblivion opened. When the sons of Skyrim would spill there own blood. But no one wanted to believe. Believe that they could exist. But when the truth finally dawns, it dawns in fire. But there is one they fear. In their tounge he is known as Sony Pictures... Slender Man!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Wen it will be released
ySy8mcceTno,well maybe sony will... use the money from the opening night of the emoji movie (25.65 million ) to make.. a good movie..
ySy8mcceTno,If these people at any sense they probably move out of this town or state or country or planet or galaxy or another universe or a new reality
ySy8mcceTno,Who else thought this was fan made
ySy8mcceTno,"Not even scary!😂

There was a small kid in my school that always said that he has a PET slenderman😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
ySy8mcceTno,This is süleymander.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm confused I thought this followed the conjuring and all those other movies...
ySy8mcceTno,The title name is realy wrong
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't hear the big gay elephant...
ySy8mcceTno,i bet 97% of what was shown isnt gonna be in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I really hope the girl who went missing managed to warn them somehow. Perhaps she wrote something down to warn her friends on something. Maybe she put the said information, I don't know, maybe in pieces of paper? And hopefully, perhaps she even, managed to pin the said ""notes"" around the forest....? If ya git meh drift"
ySy8mcceTno,this trailer just looks like a bunch of random clips
ySy8mcceTno,WHAT?! So there is a slender man movie coming out?!!
ySy8mcceTno,They don’t Evan have enough money to show his face😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Amei esse filme

ySy8mcceTno,Stop slaving
ySy8mcceTno,Why does Slender look like a midget ;_;
ySy8mcceTno,Geez Marik from YGOTAS wasn't kidding when he said that there's a slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I like that there's a movie of it coming out but why does it have to be make by Sony, there going to ruin it"
ySy8mcceTno,"#Noeyes,alwayswatching
#Slenderiswatchingyou"
ySy8mcceTno,imagine if they made an emoji movie! XD
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm still pissed about this, just because it's gonna fucking mess with the slenderverse."
ySy8mcceTno,Dood rame
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the game was freaky.... #CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"It goes like this
LA la la la
 la laaa la la la la laaaaa la la"
ySy8mcceTno,"For some reason I think this sparked the return of slenderman series like EverymanHYBRID, tribe twelve, etc. it even inspired me to do my own slenderman series"
ySy8mcceTno,0:50 Michael Myers
ySy8mcceTno,Not my slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought it said ""spider man""."
ySy8mcceTno,IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE ITS GONNA BE GOOD PRAISE GOD THEY DIDNT CHANGE IT TOO MUCH
ySy8mcceTno,Looks great but i'm very scared that the slenderman will appear ony like 2 times in the whole movie...
ySy8mcceTno,next movie : scp corporation
ySy8mcceTno,Sony learned NOTHING from matpat’s video on why video game movies suck.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY CREEPYPASTAS CAN BE MOVIES
ySy8mcceTno,one of the most classical Horror game gets a movie
ySy8mcceTno,minecraft irl looks legit
ySy8mcceTno,Terrible trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems Bad, but i am gonna see it anyways, even if i prefer the webseries:^"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man
A.K.A. 
my buddy Eric"
ySy8mcceTno,The story is not really clearly...
ySy8mcceTno,There's showing up to a party late and then there's showing up after everyone has already gone home.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,Every man is hit...
ySy8mcceTno,i wanna see it
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,"It's one thing to be inspired by Gore Verbinski's style in The Ring. It's another to flat out steal so many elements that even the trailer is jam-packed with 'em. I mean, the kid jumping off the roof or whatever in slow-mo? Come on, now. Even the same colors are used."
ySy8mcceTno,We need pen pal
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they have the proxies such as tikki toby like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,"And to think this all started as a game....





Where has the movie industry gone?"
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, Jeff the Killer?"
ySy8mcceTno,"0 out of 10, no slender man. I regret ever watching this. 2009 called, they want their Creepypasta back!"
ySy8mcceTno,😮 😲 😯 OMG
ySy8mcceTno,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo¡
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m sorry to ask but, why won’t you go for cross play or cross progression on fortnite with Microsoft and Nintendo, I mean come on, isn’t play literally in the name play in PlayStation, you guys made the PlayStation 4 for people to play with their friends, and half of the PlayStation community has friends on other consoles such as the Switch or the Xbox One, please agree, because, what you are doing now is a d move because when it comes to being the company that makes consoles, it shouldn’t matter what you want, it should matter what the community wants if you do that, people will like you more than they already do and be more happy than they already are, just because you want more of this 💰 doesn’t mean you will get more of the people on your side"
ySy8mcceTno,I wish this wasn’t a 15 ;(

ySy8mcceTno,Does it have his proxies in?plz have proxies
ySy8mcceTno,This year?what he still here?
ySy8mcceTno,Boring
ySy8mcceTno,That woman just commits suicide in school wow
ySy8mcceTno,"His name is Slenderman not SLENDER MAN, he has 4 brothers and he only wants to be loved"
ySy8mcceTno,This is probably a crappy movie since no one even likes slenderman anymore
ySy8mcceTno,Is slendrina gonna be here?
ySy8mcceTno,Is slendrina gonna be here?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok I get it, you want to catch up on an old trend. Problem is, judging by the trailer this feels nowhere like the real Slenderman. It's too cliche following the ""if it has a lot of jumpscares it's a good movie"" idea. I'll still probably see it when it comes out, but I can't expect too much from it."
ySy8mcceTno,**Is way too late.**
ySy8mcceTno,"Trailer made no sense, and you didn't see SLender Man for more than 3 seconds... doesn't make me interested sadly"
ySy8mcceTno,"Didn't Slender Man kill someone recently? 

Oh wait, they survived."
ySy8mcceTno,O bicho vindo muleke!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,That’s enough you tube for today
ySy8mcceTno,the demogorgon looks different to me tbh.
ySy8mcceTno,1:35 I wish I could do that
ySy8mcceTno,finally a slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Aaah I wanna watch ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,Hi
ySy8mcceTno,"Dunno, this might be interesting. I'm definitely gonna watch it"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm a simple man. I have BOXXY SOFTWARE and I watch everything I want LOOL
ySy8mcceTno,"I am so sick and tired of people arguing over this movie, whether it should come out or not. I mean come on! Lighten up you miserable sods!! It's just a horror movie, based on the character!! What's bad about that?"
ySy8mcceTno,Now they are also making a movie about the rake seems they are starting a creepypasta cinematic universe
ySy8mcceTno,Seems legit
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,with  headphones
ySy8mcceTno,Jason Voorhees
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me that thinks this movie looks more sad or depressing then it looks scary. Like this is one of those movies where you just feel bad for the parents or the kids.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is getting no screen time at all
ySy8mcceTno,The gay elephant is at 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,Ok im back my internet is....AHHHH OH OH OH JEEZ NO OK OK I TAKE IT BACK ITS SCARY 😨
ySy8mcceTno,Ok my i internet sucks this rakes forever not even scary lol
ySy8mcceTno,"slenderman games : our games are very scary
slenderman movie : ""cough cough"" ."
ySy8mcceTno,"I think we must all go to watch this movie as a big group. It’s not because I’m scared, just wanna make a bunch of new friends :)❤️"
ySy8mcceTno,I think it's better that it wasn't simply cashed in on at the peak of the trend
ySy8mcceTno,Finally !
ySy8mcceTno,They should have kept some basic theme of slender man game which is Lost in woods - Dark night - Riddle pages and Flashlight...
ySy8mcceTno,"If this ends up being a Babadook like movie it could be really great. What I mean by that is, a movie that plays with your mind, and doesnt rely on cheap jumpscares to scare you. Also have Slender Man appear as little as possible, that'll make him creepier."
ySy8mcceTno,In my opinion the plot is horrible. Stupid people Who makes random thinks. Slender is only a secondary character (sorry for my horrible english)
ySy8mcceTno,*edgy 12 year olds shuddering in excitement*
ySy8mcceTno,..... I wanna go and see this to say how inaccurate it is.
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope for the love of god there'll never be any creepypasta's made into movies, the fandom is quite protective of our characters.
Just leave it at Slenderman. There never needs to be Jeff The Killer or Eyeless Jack movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman i don't feel so good i dont,i don't wanna die"
ySy8mcceTno,Good job Sony you're only 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"is this just me or when i found a Slender story, always with 'disgusting things'?"

ySy8mcceTno,Oh boi cant wait to see five nights at freddies: the movie after this.
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah so what's the plot??
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 you can actually hear the gay elephant noise!
ySy8mcceTno,The movie was more about the girl than Slender Man. There was no real mystery of what Slender Man really is. Slender Man deserves a better film.
ySy8mcceTno,this movie released or not....pls anybudy telllll..........me
ySy8mcceTno,Is she going to give birth to a Slender baby?
ySy8mcceTno,It is to scary for me
ySy8mcceTno,"Still waiting is this going to come out  yes no undecided 
All the movies of slender man you don’t know if it’s real or not .  And the case about 3 friends slender man told the 2 to kill the one . But she survived the stability . Just doesn’t trust anyone anymore .  Then there’s movies documentary on slender the tall man
Ect.  There needs to be re searchers or real investigators that can bring out the truth  ."
ySy8mcceTno,They have the Slender man the rake and what’s next JEFF THE KILLER I swear I disappointed in man kind
ySy8mcceTno,*Nothing like the short film on the same name*
ySy8mcceTno,When is this gonna come out?
ySy8mcceTno,1.28 in the trees
ySy8mcceTno,Sony please remake the movie 1996 The craft

ySy8mcceTno,はよ見たいんだが
ySy8mcceTno,LMAO WHEN THO
ySy8mcceTno,"I want to leak from Sony Studios live about. Sony Entertainment wants to create a horror cinematic universe and they are going to adopt those creepypastas:
Jeff the Killer (2020)
Slenderman 2 (2020)
The Rake (2021)
Jeff the Killer 2 (2021)
Happy Appy (2021)
Candle Cove (2022)
Mr. Mix (2022)
Polybius (2022)
NES Godzilla Creepypasta (2022)
Slenderman vs Jeff the Killer (2023)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf is this trailer... I have a bad feeling about this, but I'm really hoping that this movie turns out better than expected. It's already bad that I didn't see something like the girl collecting pages, and there better not be too much screen time of the town otherwise it'll be like every other ""horror"" movie with drama.

Also, after this... There better not be a Jeff the Killer movie, his pasta story is just terrible. Please please do something great for Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,I came here just to see how slender man looks like in 2018 but sadly he didn’t appear on the video
ySy8mcceTno,1:15 HI
ySy8mcceTno,"I heard about this “Slenderman” character on the internet, some people swear he’s real. It’s strange."

ySy8mcceTno,"Let me guess, you're gonna make slendy just your average monster?

I'll stick with emh tribe twelve and the others."
ySy8mcceTno,Very sloppy trailer tbh
ySy8mcceTno,"Cliche and boring. What is even the plot here? Was this movie in production for 5 years? Slenderman isn't relevant anymore, I thought we moved on already."
ySy8mcceTno,"Bugs just do that (wiggle on forest ground), right? Have you ever seen a bug that is sitting on a chair reading a book and then ask, ""Could you please past me some tea?"" No, bugs just like to wiggle on the forest ground or wherever they want. That is the bug way"
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Cand va apărea filmul
ySy8mcceTno,Interesting trailers but made no sense
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a whole lotta nope for me.
ySy8mcceTno,"I think its a boring movie, because the character (SLENDERMAN) has quite boring image?'"
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon : slendrina movie
ySy8mcceTno,Looks Like A Remake Of The Ring! 😂
ySy8mcceTno,2018 art
ySy8mcceTno,I Hope Yhis Real
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is about what you can expect from Sony taking a mediocre game and then turning it into a giant steaming turd of a movie
ySy8mcceTno,I thought That This is spiderman
ySy8mcceTno,Was the appearance of 47 inspired from that of slender man? 😮
ySy8mcceTno,Why is it slenderman is barely in this trailer when the movie is named after him?????
ySy8mcceTno,"y los tentáculos? yo quería ver tentáculos negros entrar por la ventana, asfixiar a las víctimas, rodear los cuerpos de las niñas inocentes, moverse frenéticamente, etc."
ySy8mcceTno,Too late
ySy8mcceTno,I imagine the origin in the movie that would be SICK!
ySy8mcceTno,This is so disappointing. I loved the original creepypasta and the games. And now this? WASTED POTENTIAL! Sony could gone so good with the original but now its raped. Thx Sony. For raping one of the best creepypastas...
ySy8mcceTno,when
ySy8mcceTno,"This might be horrifying but , not just now !!👌"
ySy8mcceTno,It feels like I’ve seen the whole movie in this stupid trailer
ySy8mcceTno,There will never be a good slender man movie. The original creepy pasta didn't contain enough info
ySy8mcceTno,FanMade or Real??
ySy8mcceTno,"hmm, only 5 years too late. But thanks for reminding me of the travesty that slenderman was."
ySy8mcceTno,Is he good or bad?
ySy8mcceTno,This is not the origin story :c but when jeff the killer movie or laughing jack movie is coming? :D omg laughing jack movie...cool... and jeff xD but if jeff the killer movie coming...do not fail it!! if you do jeff the killer movie...origin story please :c!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Why there butchered 3 movies and now making another one I’m going to laugh if this is another failure stop using slender man he is a cliche horror monster now and please stop using creepy pastas it’s  just getting more stupid
ySy8mcceTno,#iforgotthisshitwascomingout
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this is a real movie that’s really coming out cuz ima be mad if it doesn’t, and I hope it’s better than what this trailer looks, don’t get me wrong it looks not to bad but I hope they don’t ruin slender man and make this movie really good"
ySy8mcceTno,eso no tiene nada que ver con Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This is not slender man I saw the girl stabbing herself in a different movie
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait August 2012 is gonna be lit!!!
ySy8mcceTno,2:15 Did she gave him a blowjob so that he would let her go???
ySy8mcceTno,Dont watch this at 3AM
ySy8mcceTno,That slenderman jumpscare at 2:39

ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for this
ySy8mcceTno,Love the music at the end
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone tell me who really made up slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,"There's a lot of visuals in this trailer that remind me of similar things from The Ring (American version, obviously). They were new at the time, but there have been so many movies that have done it since, that it's not groundbreaking anymore. Still creepy to look at (maggots, body horror stuff like the sharp implement in the eye), but not enough to be engaging to an audience that has already seen similar things. Not in a lasting way, anyway.
I just might shell out the money to go see it on cheap night in the theatre, but only because I think that's the only way I might find any enjoyment in it. I doubt it's the kind of thing I'd be able to get into at home, as I would constantly be distracted by other things, because it really does look like a very generic horror film."
ySy8mcceTno,"so late for this. Guys, Slenderman is my dad. >:D yay!  #CanYouSeeHim"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks as bad as you'd expect it to be
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman: jeff the killer i dont feel so good 
Jeff the killer:shhhhhhh go to sleep"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks a  bit boring
ySy8mcceTno,This is about 4 years late of the trend
ySy8mcceTno,They need to add masky
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think they are going to release it because of the girl that got stabbed 19 times
ySy8mcceTno,So will they collect 8 pages then

ySy8mcceTno,mișto film
ySy8mcceTno,Why is it always kids in these movies in these days XD I know it is horror but now your making a virus? I thought Slenderman was a guardian of the forest that saves depressed children so that he can take them to paradise? I assume.
ySy8mcceTno,Is that slendrina at the very end? Is that the little girl

ySy8mcceTno,#1 rule: NEVER LOOK BACK
ySy8mcceTno,"I do like that there's the interesting take on that Slender Man feeds off of the paranoia, fear, and madness that comes hardwired within the human psyche and slowly drives them insane until they are in his clutches. However...
Why. Isn't. He. Wearing. A. *SUIT?!*

ySy8mcceTno,this is gonna giv ptsd to the kid who got stabbed because of her friend trying to sacrificing her to slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Wow fantastic
ySy8mcceTno,My mom says we are gonna watch slenderman and I'm not really scared cause I watched a lot of scary movies but I'm still kinda scared

ySy8mcceTno,"""Jump-Scare: The Movie"""
ySy8mcceTno,When is this movie coming out? I heard May and then it didnt happen and they're not saying any date now.
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted to see this movie for such a Long time
ySy8mcceTno,How about the slenderverse?
ySy8mcceTno,snooze fest tbh :)
ySy8mcceTno,next movie gta my mother april 20 2018
ySy8mcceTno,пиздец ахуенно!!!
ySy8mcceTno,wow!  i  gonna watch it
ySy8mcceTno,"Fashionably late, huh Sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn't this the game responsible for several child murders in real life?
ySy8mcceTno,Very hororr
ySy8mcceTno,We are Venom.
ySy8mcceTno,They should make a movie about me ;3
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I can not wait for this to come out! It’s my master after all :}
ySy8mcceTno,It's been 5 months @@
ySy8mcceTno,"Really?  A Slenderman movie?  Not only is this a bit...late...(Slenderman isn't a thing anymore okay guys?) this trailer is the most cliched horror trailer I've ever seen.  Screaming women/girls?  Check!  Insects coming from places where insects should not come?  Check!  Someone freaking out in a hospital?  Check!  Someone moving a body part (head in this case) in a really fast, jerky motion?  Fucking CHECK."
ySy8mcceTno,at 0:56 everything starts to make no sense. the beginning was starting to look so promising.
ySy8mcceTno,"Se ve que va a estar bien chingona esta película, me recuerda a 2013"
ySy8mcceTno,when's the next trailer
ySy8mcceTno,It seems to me that Slenderman himself is hardly in the movie at all
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer reminds me a lot of The Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,I cant sleep Any more
ySy8mcceTno,Eita poha intenso
ySy8mcceTno,*เปรตอังกฤษ  *.-.  น่ากลัวชิบ...

ySy8mcceTno,Yuzzzzzz finally
ySy8mcceTno,Wow first it was just game but now film cool
ySy8mcceTno,0:19 sounds like batman's voice
ySy8mcceTno,Ummm this has shown already
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this
ySy8mcceTno,OMG 😮
ySy8mcceTno,"The reason they didn't make the movie before is because there was a ""slenderman"" themed stabbing years back and it would've been too insensitive to put up a movie right after it."
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is based on a true story.
ySy8mcceTno,I formally request a ticcy Toby film
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully no dumb white girls try to kill each other after watching this
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, I'm done."
ySy8mcceTno,tfw your childhood nightmare comes to a movie
ySy8mcceTno,i swear i really see him when i was a kid
ySy8mcceTno,"Her tongue is in her hand. Her mouth is bloody, and she's not speaking."

ySy8mcceTno,Ugh joey king! Kissing booth now in slenderman!!! 😍👏
ySy8mcceTno,lançado
ySy8mcceTno,que dia vai ser lanc
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no. This is going to be so bad. The internet has twisted the original SlenderMan to the point of no return.  If I see one “Proxy” mark in this movie I swear. Sony prepare for lots of back lash for this movie. And also you’re very late in the train.

ySy8mcceTno,Btw. This is pointless
ySy8mcceTno,Technically isn't he real concerning most people think he is. I'm just going by 2/3 majority. Cause in 1/3rd and this is appalling
ySy8mcceTno,will never top Marble Hornets in my book.
ySy8mcceTno,Someone should REALLY fucking fire the executives in the Sony movie department. These fuckers are ruining the image the company has built for itself.
ySy8mcceTno,Saw is more scarier than this.
ySy8mcceTno,Skinny  Man
ySy8mcceTno,Well this may suck but I'm interested to see the character design of the Slenderman monster and I would really like to see a Jeff the Killer movie and get the people who do stranger things behind that.
ySy8mcceTno,they used the same sounds and clips throughout the entire trailer so i know nothing except slender man is somewhat bad dude lol
ySy8mcceTno,emoji movie 2 am i riht
ySy8mcceTno,Why are you reading this comment?
ySy8mcceTno,Bueno y para cuándo la peli?
ySy8mcceTno,"haha what if instead of a cliche piece of garbage you made a slenderman movie that actually follows the legitimate (yes i hate myself for saying this but it has to be said) l o r e of the character? instead of a ""ArEnT jUmPsCaReS jUsT hOrIfYiNg ?"" kind of movie, what if you did a psychological horror that actually follows the lore/canon of the character. it'd be much more horrifying if it had been about the paranoia and genuine horror that one feels after knowing about the slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg!!! Hype!!!!! +1000000
ySy8mcceTno,ainda esperando
ySy8mcceTno,"IVE WAITED FOREVER FOR THIS, FINALLY A SLENDER MAN MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,"Very unoriginal, I can tell it’s going to have “creepy” visuals but nothing actually scary"
ySy8mcceTno,how is this slender wtf
ySy8mcceTno,This is one mess up spiderman trailer i seen
ySy8mcceTno,"Is it me or did the Trailer remind me of The Ring, especially when you see the person fulling with their arms out."
ySy8mcceTno,This is real omg :0
ySy8mcceTno,Make new oniverse!
ySy8mcceTno,this is one of the worst movies ! i dislike the story .
ySy8mcceTno,what a strange trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Cagaram no trailer deve q vai ser uma bosta
ySy8mcceTno,"Maybe if you were someone who hadnt started with marble hornets and followed the lore then this would look better but honestly it looks cheap. It looks worse than a lot of fan made YouTube vids. The source and lore are there, half the work was done for you and yet this is what came of it."
ySy8mcceTno,Cool
ySy8mcceTno,another blare witch project
ySy8mcceTno,I am angry at you Sony
ySy8mcceTno,is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,"L, this looks generic as hell and didn't make any sense at all."
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m actually looking forward to this. Makes me nostalgic of 2012, a simpler time."
ySy8mcceTno,I really don’t feel like this movie deserves it but people never actually realize that movies can’t keep up with trends because it takes months to years to make movies so adding “trendy things” to movies will never work but with this movie after maybe the first month of production (maybe even the first day) they should’ve stopped because obviously when they make the movie it won’t exactly be very trendy then... but hey it’s their fault they thought this was a good idea
ySy8mcceTno,"For all of you who are confused of this trailer, it shows that Slenderman is although fake, he can become real if you believe in him or fear him too much. Basically causing you into insanity making you do things you wouldn't actually want to chose yourself. That's why he has all of these scary features and everyone freaking out when they even imagine him."
ySy8mcceTno,There should be 8 pages to collect right?
ySy8mcceTno,Is the girl supposed to be Lazari?
ySy8mcceTno,anyone notice how none of this is relevant to the legends?
ySy8mcceTno,This makes no sense to even do this after that stabbing incident why that girl a terrified
ySy8mcceTno,this is trash i only seen him 2 times and you did not show his body
ySy8mcceTno,This feels fake and real at the same time
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna know how many people that watched this are actually in the fandom
ySy8mcceTno,Typical hollywood horror. Complete garbage. Way to ruin slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,*sees first 10 seconds* Nope I'm going to the comments where it's safe
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the girl at the end was Sally Williams
ySy8mcceTno,I want movie of jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,i'm in December now and they have released an Eyeless Jack movie
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't even look like it's a slenderman movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"They should have filmed this in 3D, that way they could show Slenderman's tentacles reaching into the pockets of movie goers who paid to see an obvious cash grab. The only people going missing in this are George Washington and Abraham Lincoln"
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,How the hell do you make a 2 hour movie out of photoshopped images on the internet?And why is joey king in this?I guess they never saw how horrible she was in Wish upon
ySy8mcceTno,it does not show slender man only people effected by the slender man sickness that makes people go mad like in marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer only shows people being affected by the slenderman sickness/virus (like in the channel marble hornets) so they r being driven mad. They probably did not want to show slender man in the trailer for some reason
ySy8mcceTno,Idk about the trailer but I want to watch this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This is not fanmade.they play it in cinema before watching the movie
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim?
ySy8mcceTno,from here 0:08 to here 0:19  the audio had my interest .. after that you lost me
ySy8mcceTno,I just want to know the rating.
ySy8mcceTno,"So, no more finding missing pages now?"
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie will get bad reviews.
ySy8mcceTno,"Maybe a 2nd trailer is due, if possible?"
ySy8mcceTno,Nobody can save this movie from getting flopped on box-office.............
ySy8mcceTno,"Why can't they just honor the source material by making a simple movie about a guy/group of people lost in the woods who are trying to collect 8 notes in order to stop an unknown yet horrifying monster that they can't look directly at from attacking them? If you kept it simple and honor the material, the movie could be really solid"

ySy8mcceTno,Finaly a move of Slenderman!!!
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is too late. Slender Man is way out dated. Same goes to the other old creepy pastas.
ySy8mcceTno,This better nog be trash
ySy8mcceTno,Wait this trailer was supposed to come out in two days great job Youtube
ySy8mcceTno,Is this movie cancelled or something?
ySy8mcceTno,M
ySy8mcceTno,hay algien aqui que hable español
ySy8mcceTno,Shite
ySy8mcceTno,Wow cylinder man looks great
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like one of those fake horror movie trailers where they've just stolen a bunch of clips from different movies
ySy8mcceTno,It’s a little too late but I’m not judging until I see the movie
ySy8mcceTno,hopefully its less scarier than the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Slender will only actually appear for 5 minutes then get shot dead before he even uses his powers
ySy8mcceTno,K verha :v acabo de ver
ySy8mcceTno,"This is like Thirteen Reasons Why but with something evil behind it, I also cant make out of this trailer and it barely resembles Slender Man. Whats up with the ""movie world"" on messing with movies that are supposed to be at its original story, ITS TRUE PRIME story and make it as creepy as it was in the original story. What the heck is this crap!?!"
ySy8mcceTno,ดูเหมือนหนังจะไม่ค่อยน่าสนุกอ่ะ
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't get why so much hate on this, it looks very good actually. They had to contextualize the urban legend to a believable plot that has to last something like 100 minutes, it can't be 100% identical to videogames and creepypastas"
ySy8mcceTno,I will watch it only to see what she has in her hands!
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s his suit
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean I have always wanted a Slenderman movie to come out, But the trailer doesn't really resemble what it is and how it is when it comes to Slenderman, But I'll watch it and it seems kinda intresting so why not, But you better include he's proxies tho Sony! 😂 Like if you want all the creepypastas to either get together or have a movie for themselves so like for each creepypasta, coz I honestly would love that! I need to either see my ship Judge Angel X Bloody Painter irl or just a story about her and it only focuses on her and her adventure on her own with finding other creepypastas, etc. 😝"

ySy8mcceTno,Like this is going to stop murder
ySy8mcceTno,What about the pages
ySy8mcceTno,"Apparently the movie is so bad, Sony is trying to pass the movie off on another distributor. Not even Amazon and Netflix want it."
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, as long as the original design and some of the games static sound effects are used, then I think this could turn out to be a decent film"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm gonna love this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Make a better trailer that looks not like slender im a huge fan of horror games and movies and I like Sony movies not all but some I thought they could a make a better movie trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,Wait is this the one that everybody starts to kill themself
ySy8mcceTno,that was wild bro
ySy8mcceTno,is this a fan made trailer or something? it's a shitty trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I'd completely forgotten about the craze that was slenderman...honestly nothing about this seems slender man ish at all
ySy8mcceTno,I don't care what people say. I still waiting to watch this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf trailer sucks honestly, slender man.. most people dont even know the story.. come on sony you can make a better trailer. Hopefully the movie is way way way better."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is real
ySy8mcceTno,What's next fidget spinner the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they mention Jeff the Killer
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is scrolling down the comments to see if there are any jump scares
ySy8mcceTno,They should make a slender we know one
ySy8mcceTno,Spoiler alert spider man dies in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,It feels like a fan made trailer
ySy8mcceTno,the movie lools lame
ySy8mcceTno,they're so late for this movie it kinda makes me a bit sad... oh well.
ySy8mcceTno,Bro people on my school said they will hace a move about this movie and i was like for really i have to see this movie

Especially this poorly done slender man 1:51 XDD"
ySy8mcceTno,This is crazy that theyre starting to make creepypastas in to movies the last time it was The rake now its Slenderman :0
ySy8mcceTno,This looks more related to the Slenderman murder than the actual Slenderman. Even then it seems hardly connected.
ySy8mcceTno,I can't even see him
ySy8mcceTno,I am confusion
ySy8mcceTno,looks goooooooooooooooooood
ySy8mcceTno,Way to capitalize on a new trend Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"I See no pages





Wat tha hell"
ySy8mcceTno,that’s not how slender mans lore goes
ySy8mcceTno,When will this come out
ySy8mcceTno,Estoy en directo slenderman the arrival
ySy8mcceTno,There really should a movie showing Slenderman 10 - 10.
ySy8mcceTno,"No no no no no!!! This isn't the Slender I know, sure he kidnaps girls and plays crule games but this is different and I don't like it one bit!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Veio   que   susto
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it'd work better as a series of short films rather than one long feature length movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I havé à important News for you (Slender Man Côme for the 24th august

ySy8mcceTno,Wait a minute is he John Cena
ySy8mcceTno,OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS YESSSSSSS FINALLYYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,This a comedy?
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is boring he did not scare me I'm not scared of anything. even not horror games and not Evan. horror movies and Evan. My  finger was. Cut. I'm just gonna drink the blood because  it's my blood and it's my part of my body Evan jump scare I not scary. for me Evan. i do 3am challenge Evan. FaceTime. It.  FaceTime. Jigsaw. Evan I FaceTime. Granny and they came to my house I'm not if came to my house I will kill the. i will lick the in the face I will punch the with my. Fist that's it
ySy8mcceTno,"To be perfectly honest, I know it feels that the movie doesn't feel the same as something slenderman related would feel, but when you think about it, the Marble Hornets series was subtle and slow with the slenderman. The imagery, words, and little visage of the slenderman used in this movie kind of give off the more natural feel that Marble Hornets did. We will see how this plays out. in all honesty, I have hope for it. Let's try to just look at it in a good light first."
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of IT for some reason.
ySy8mcceTno,Still am waiting for slender woman..
ySy8mcceTno,"It's like they didn't even try to come up with an original idea for a Slenderman story. This looks like it's going to be super cliche and bland already. Hopefully I'm wrong, but it really does."
ySy8mcceTno,...I didn't get any of this from the game.
ySy8mcceTno,My name is PEWDIEPIEEEE
ySy8mcceTno,"Callin it. Slendy will make one, or two appearances. The rest will be a shitty Final Destination. (comedy of the year?_)"
ySy8mcceTno,"First the Emoji movie, now this???"
ySy8mcceTno,Wait she is possessed by slender man? Plus I hope we see slendrina in it.
ySy8mcceTno,seems cool
ySy8mcceTno,When is it coming out?
ySy8mcceTno,"Please don’t write death notes or threats because this is just my opinion. 
But this movie actually looks good and I look forward to seeing this, and I like the fact that they made it more rare when you see slender man so that it adds more of a fear factor when you do. But this trailer looks creepy and I do like it... but it’s not slender man... like mind tricks and all that. But I still like seeing slender man and it’ll be a great horror movie."
ySy8mcceTno,It’s night I feel creeped out
ySy8mcceTno,I’m surprised this is actually real!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"2018,who dis?"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie might make a lot of money or less money, but the reviews are gonna be terrible. Rotten Tomatoes is gonna seriously hate this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is gonna fail I can feel it. The comments are ""this movie is crap""."
ySy8mcceTno,What if they made movies about all the creepy pastas?
ySy8mcceTno,"There's a few resons why this movie will be a flop: 
1:The  Slenderman trend was back in 2012, and the trend has been long dead since then. 
2: The Trailer made no sense and it was just a bunch of random scary clips from the movie. 
3: Slenderman is fake, he was inspired by a photo shopping contest photo and a person made a video game of Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,"Everyone is so totally against this and its ridiculous I feel like some aren't really trying to give it a chance and some are just jumping on the bandwagon because everyone else dislikes it being made, me on the other hand I'm freaking excited for it this could actually be a freaking BETTER slender man movie then all the others get over yourselves, its not gonna be your interpretation of slender man its gonna be theirs"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is the start of the movie 
A man wakes up in the middle of a forest he seen a page that says ""Can't run""
Then slender man takes him"
ySy8mcceTno,"wait, when did the movie come out??"
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 wow I never knew venom was in this movie ;)
ySy8mcceTno,sony makes all the bizarre movies
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie: Slendrina
ySy8mcceTno,"For people who are confused on what the actual HELL is happening, I think this is supposed to represent how slenderman infects his victims with the slender sickness.  Forcing them to become his 'proxies'.  Personally I think this trailer looks promising and dont care what anyone says"
ySy8mcceTno,alittle late to the trend
ySy8mcceTno,"This has potential. This could be just a poorly cut trailer, so I'm going to stay cautiously optimistic"
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice cutting pasting, mother....er"
ySy8mcceTno,Fun Fact: Slenderman was created for a Photoshop contest. It won.
ySy8mcceTno,Nowadays it’s easy to tell what’s a cash grab and what’s a well thought out movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Me and my little sister really wants to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Y ademas imaginanse estar solos en el bosque y que todos les tuvieron miedo por se raro

ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe you done this.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony snatchin up public domain IPs like cheap beer at an open bar.

ySy8mcceTno,All the likes are just from edgy 12 year olds
ySy8mcceTno,Joey King is in it!!!! Yay
ySy8mcceTno,hmm maybe 3-4 years ago this would of been scary... bit late

I know what you're all going to say, "" But Harry Potter went so huge, everyone cared!"" I don't want to hear it. Some books like IT, didn't make it's movie until like 10 years later or so. So please stop talking about it!"

ySy8mcceTno,Looks like slender girl
ySy8mcceTno,It could be men in black of other dimension.
ySy8mcceTno,I am surprised they are even making a movie of a creature some random guy on some forum thought of and most people have never even heard of.
ySy8mcceTno,Booq

ySy8mcceTno,"Oh great another Sony movie,please for the LOVE OF GOD use the psychological meaning for slender man such as ""He never leaves until your dead"",""You see it but others dont"",""Going haywire from insanity till suicide""...etc"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this them running out of ideas?
ySy8mcceTno,So  scary  trailer 😨😨😨😨😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like shiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeets of boring essays.
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is not convincing

ySy8mcceTno,A movie based off a creepy pasta based off a photo
ySy8mcceTno,Hey look. Hollywood officially ran out of ideas 😒😂
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a spinoff of Stranger Things. But Slenderman will always be my OG horror game.
ySy8mcceTno,ENDER MAN. Coming soon.

ySy8mcceTno,"Mr Stark, I Dont Feel So Good *Fades Away In Dust*"
ySy8mcceTno,is this the trailer for the new slenderman movie comming out in 2018
ySy8mcceTno,La peli sale un poco bastante tarde no?
ySy8mcceTno,I love Slenderman! I read creepypasta and Slenderman he is the best creepypasta character
ySy8mcceTno,yaawn
ySy8mcceTno,it is FANMADE trailer or what?
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,"all I can say is writers.......watch ""Cabin in the woods before you decide to write a script so that way you can see what NOT to put in your scripts to piss us off..........hell play a few hours of Resident Evil:Biohazard.......that'll tell you what u need to do to scare us or at least the right direction to go"
ySy8mcceTno,this made no sens
ySy8mcceTno,"việt nam , hãy cho tôi xem cánh tay của các bạn"
ySy8mcceTno,Who else hates Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Hey when did it or when does it come out
ySy8mcceTno,from creepypasta to slasher hes been promoted
ySy8mcceTno,When Does This Come Out?
ySy8mcceTno,This look mad !
ySy8mcceTno,Is that girl supose to be Slendrina?
ySy8mcceTno,Where are Slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,cool
ySy8mcceTno,Welp if they made slender man they should make lps
ySy8mcceTno,"Odd choice for a trailer.. offers nothing besides a few scenes that are stale. Seems like a generic horror movie that splashes some slender man in, could have done so much more with this..."
ySy8mcceTno,"And to think all this started with a simple contest entry from a forum user all those years ago. Ah, how things evolve."
ySy8mcceTno,What a skinny legend
ySy8mcceTno,Cuando sale
ySy8mcceTno,i am SO going to see this
ySy8mcceTno,I was excited to watch this movie but the trailer make me disappointed about it
ySy8mcceTno,wow bro is it fake
ySy8mcceTno,What part of this is slender man??
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like I'm watching a rings video.
ySy8mcceTno,"Best comedy of the year, I hope"
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,This one isn't even scary
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna watch venom
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man isn't like that
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Enderman
ySy8mcceTno,nice :D
ySy8mcceTno,You can tell people love this by the dislikes ;)
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was fake until I saw Sony pictures entertainment as the creator. What's next Five Nights At Freddy's movie? P.S. (Please make that)
ySy8mcceTno,The game scares me more than the movie itself.
ySy8mcceTno,Sponsored by KFC
ySy8mcceTno,0:38
ySy8mcceTno,O :38
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this movie being made in FUCKING 2018?
ySy8mcceTno,People have been saying there's going to be a slender man moving but you just need to focus on slender man see his back story how he became who he is like in the first dead pool movie but the trailer is still good though
ySy8mcceTno,I haven’t seen anything on this for ages.... Jesus is it even coming out at this rate?
ySy8mcceTno,When does this come out
ySy8mcceTno,Never watching this. It has nothing to do with the actual facts of the Slenderman series thumbs down
ySy8mcceTno,To me it like looks like a bunch of anxiety filled emo teens
ySy8mcceTno,I prefer the creepypasta.
ySy8mcceTno,That got slender man all wrong
ySy8mcceTno,I saw Slenderman on Park
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys, this movie can't be the WORST movie. We need to watch the movie and see it for ourselves. We have may just grotesque films before this trailer was released. I am up to watching this movie. Sony, you must continue making this SLENDERMAN Movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who wants SCP: Containment Breach movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks shiite
ySy8mcceTno,"So with there being a Five Nights at Freddy’s movie, a Minecraft movie (no seriously, that’s gonna be a thing), and now a Slender Man Movie, I wouldn’t be surprised if they make a ROBLOX movie next."
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer looks like it was meant to be the next chapter in The Ring series down to the very smallest details. I wonder if it's the same director if not I smell a lawsuit coming!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"You’re too late to making this, but if you some how revive the Slender Man to it’s full glory like 5 years ago, I’ll pay major respects to you guys."
ySy8mcceTno,Hey 2011 called
ySy8mcceTno,"You can't make a movie about Slenderman.
Slenderman isn't a monster, or a movie topic. Slenderman is a phenomena, made to scare children and to spread across the internet. Seeing a black and white photo of children and a mysterious man in a suit with no face in the background can be scary if you're a kid. Seeing a CGI generic movie monster with tentacles stealing children is not. It's like you made a movie about Cthulhu. It's not a monster. It's an idea."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,This is nothing like the game- they seem to have just taken the character of Slender Man and made it into a typical horror film
ySy8mcceTno,"And the ""Slenderman theme song""?"
ySy8mcceTno,Why does anyone make those movies? I mean that would be nice if you create a movie with the story of Slenderman...
ySy8mcceTno,did they forget it's not 2014 anymore?
ySy8mcceTno,"I cringed so hard my panties got wet, and I only wear boxers"
ySy8mcceTno,Why is Slenderman... Growling???
ySy8mcceTno,"Makes a trailer
Makes reaction videos
Forgets it exists and not let anybody know the release date"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks good
ySy8mcceTno,"i'm pissing in my pants right now, i'm so scared!"
ySy8mcceTno,finally they made a movie after all these years we got a slender movie okay like it's going to be bad movie I have the feeling it's gonna be very boring I think they won't make the story right it's 40% story movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope you pump out a better trailer than this before the movie is released. This seems like a film I would want to see, but this trailer is terrible. It makes no sense. It's disjointed as hell. No narration to give ANY context or relation to the many characters shown in the trailer. If this is the best trailer you can cobble together, I'll pass."
ySy8mcceTno,what is this and what does girl have to do it and why are there different type of girls makes no sense
ySy8mcceTno,Looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"The reason why this movie should be rated R.
Its has disturbing images."
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/yyqZ5nG2VS8
ySy8mcceTno,Silinder-man...
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah Sony Pictures, this movie will be an abortion."
ySy8mcceTno,Joey king I love her
ySy8mcceTno,Remove the SL then see what the name is.
ySy8mcceTno,They're about 5 years late with this one... the games were trending in 2012-2013. Unless it could be based on the story of the 13 year old girl who almost got killed by her 2 friends because those two gullible bitches tried to summon Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,"If you're gonna make a horror movie about slender Man, at least make it make sense and look at the original source material, because this looks nothing like a Slender Man movie."
ySy8mcceTno,I don't understand any of the scene tho 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Looks cool but I'm not sure if this is real or not...you figured they would show slender man a little bit more...but eh
ySy8mcceTno,u ok man?
ySy8mcceTno,"Great thing I turned 16 this year!
Lowkey don’t watch a lot of horror films. But I can’t skip this one!"
ySy8mcceTno,"For all the fools who dont understand this simple trailer. It seems the movie is going to be about the murders that killed their friend in the woods, claiming slender man told them to do it. It also can be taken that it was will be showing their point of view on how they ""expierenced"" slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,"where she walks into the police, she's holding 8 pieces of paper"
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems neat, I'd watch it. Slender man appears less well, Slender man more like just a clack figure but I still can't wait! 
#CanYouSeeHim"
ySy8mcceTno,Plz as soon 🔜 as come
ySy8mcceTno,So when this coming out i haven seen any trailers
ySy8mcceTno,Did This Get Cancel Or Something?
ySy8mcceTno,oh look its terrible movie
ySy8mcceTno,Not amused !!
ySy8mcceTno,Put it with avenger infinity war 2 slenderman new villian
ySy8mcceTno,"*Always watching*
         ⨂        ⨂

ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't even show him
ySy8mcceTno,This is bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,i still like vemon better than this is dumb
ySy8mcceTno,"What if they made a Creepypasta movie, that would be awesome"
ySy8mcceTno,"probably the Movies in 2019:
Sonic.EXE
Fnaf 1,2,3,4 etc.
ROBLOX
Minecraft
Fortnite
League of Legends
sanic
mario
youtube
watch dogs
gta 5
and just cause 1,2,3"
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,"7 years late
And I can’t see him"
ySy8mcceTno,Bro I expected the slender man movie to be kinda exactly like the game lol
ySy8mcceTno,I'm still going to see this
ySy8mcceTno,A movie after a creepy photoshop my uncle made one day. Who thought it could go this far. My uncle never thought this would happen. We just made stories about slender man and now it’s so popular
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,"People are bored of Superhero movies, so they started with horror movies"
ySy8mcceTno,that scene in the trailer where there is like a needle or something stabbing into an eye.... thats sooo disturbing and uncomfortable... IT'S FINALLY HEEEREEEEE
ySy8mcceTno,"John Cena is actually slender man 
#canuseehim"
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember back in 2012 when I was so hyped up about making slender into a film. 

6 years later, the hype is dead, and now they're actually making one, the hype just hasn't come back after all these years."
ySy8mcceTno,You know how much money they would have made if they would have came out with this when it was the rave of #2013? lol.
ySy8mcceTno,Yay! Hopefully this turns out to be a good one.. the trailer looks decent! Fingers crossed!
ySy8mcceTno,It’s awesome because they finally made a slender man movie almost a decade after everybody stopped caring about him.
ySy8mcceTno,When is soon
ySy8mcceTno,Where's Slender Man ?
ySy8mcceTno,1:44 Am i the only one that caught the bells used in the game ?
ySy8mcceTno,wtf did i just watch lol thats  2 mins ill never get back
ySy8mcceTno,"Question :can you see him? 
Anaswer:yes. You are so stupid. We can see him. There is he in the trailer. You duffer."
ySy8mcceTno,#YesICanSeeHimHesFrickinEverywhere
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t even look like s good movhe
ySy8mcceTno,I wish I was still scared of slender I really do. Good bye 2010-2013 I used to be scared of him.
ySy8mcceTno,If you think this is a fan made trailer you'd laugh
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus, someone clearly is missing what's trending. Next thing we'll be seeing from them is FNAF possibly 20 years from now. Though on a slightly different note, this doesn't look all that good. I mean, out of all the entire trailer you only see the Slenderman a couple of times. This film seems more of a pyscho-horror than anything else, and a very cheap one at that. I'm honestly betting they don't even actually collect any pages, and when I say that, I'm not counting that wall of art, that's not collecting, that's drawing."
ySy8mcceTno,❤❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,finally
ySy8mcceTno,😪
ySy8mcceTno,when is the releasing date of this movie is there had been a slender man movie in 2013
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next Jeff the killer THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,It should have came out a long time ago now. Slender man isn’t popular any more
ySy8mcceTno,BOI IF THEY MAKE MOVIES ABOUT SLENDER MAN THEY NEED TO HAVE THE PROXY SYMBOLS INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWINGS OF HIM
ySy8mcceTno,But does it have 8 pages to collect?
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,And just like that they ruined slender man 😑
ySy8mcceTno,Omg 0o0 cool!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,this looks really tacky lmao
ySy8mcceTno,god imm scared
ySy8mcceTno,Ive been waiting
ySy8mcceTno,WHY MAKE A MOVIE OUT OF A CREEPYPASTA
ySy8mcceTno,They forgot aspects about him like he has 4 proxies and that he eats of kids and pretty much only teens and kids
ySy8mcceTno,Yasss FINEALLY A MOVIE ABOUT SLENDERMANNN
ySy8mcceTno,"As weird as this trailer is, I'm guessing this movie will either be a true masterpiece created by a genius or an absolute mess. Hopefully the former."
ySy8mcceTno,Well it's official they're running out of ideas cause now they're doing Creepy Pastas  (I know slenders a video game but most peoples remember him as a  Creepypasta)
ySy8mcceTno,Bullshit movie didn't even scared
ySy8mcceTno,"Umm are u sure this is a SLENDERMAN trailer?? 





I don't think so."
ySy8mcceTno,This is why I live in California
ySy8mcceTno,Umm... what are you doing it again Sony? Because I'm reading the title and it says Slender Man and it seems more like any ordinary suspenseful movie with insane asylums in hospitals... typical horror movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"The thing is that if you just look at slenderman he seems like a pretty nice guy.
When I read up on him He seems to be a misunderstood old guy who can't control his head. Like a really old Eleven"
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully it's scarier than the videogames (which some of them are quite scary)
ySy8mcceTno,Slendrina's father in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Until know i cant understund who is "" SLENDER MAN """
ySy8mcceTno,"Itwould have made more sense and probably made fans of creepy pasta and slender like myself like this trailer more if it had stronger ties to the Marble Hornets and the slender folklore (eg. The original picture, slender man 'sightings' and original stories) rather then being loosely based on the slender man killings in 2003(?)"
ySy8mcceTno,finally a slender man movie i have bin waiting
ySy8mcceTno,this was made in my hometown 😛
ySy8mcceTno,0:44 just grab 8 pages and you’ll be fine
ySy8mcceTno,Not even worth your money 💰
ySy8mcceTno,"First when I saw the thumbnail of this cardio I thought it was a marvel movie for slenderman 





Just imagine Bruce banner saying
There is a slender man now?"
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the Only one who read that Spiderman 😂😂😂😂😂😉
ySy8mcceTno,nonsense
ySy8mcceTno,"Now there should be a granny a d a slenderina movie 


If you know what I mean"

ySy8mcceTno,Hey look! Its slendy and his armani suit
ySy8mcceTno,0:58
ySy8mcceTno,Bú cu
ySy8mcceTno,omg this reminds me of the story i read recently about those 3 girls and the 2 girls killed the 1 girl because slender man said they are gonna go to his mansion or something. the girls where only 12 years. the 2 girls that killed the other girl got sentence to 40 years in a mental hospital. i wonder of this on that story.
ySy8mcceTno,At 0:03 i thought this was a trailer for venom 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Dang the person who made this urban legend really had an impact on the U.S.A
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok. Starting off, this movie is so messed up."
ySy8mcceTno,I FUCKING NEED THIS!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Is there slendrina and granny?
ySy8mcceTno,no sony place dont spdy shoud be on marvel
ySy8mcceTno,This is actually a true story BC in the news I heard that slender stab two girls 40 times and they still survive so when the inventigaters found them in pike an year so they took them to the physically hospital for 40years and this happen In 2014/15 that mean that they are still alive probably like 15yr old by now
ySy8mcceTno,He’s at 1:41
ySy8mcceTno,PLEASE MAKE AT LEAST ONE PROXIE COME ON EITHER MASKY TICCI TOBY HOODIE OR KATE THE CHASER PLEASE!!!!!!!

ySy8mcceTno,Amazing
ySy8mcceTno,I remember I went to the movie theater couple of months ago and asked a girl when the slender man movie will come out and she said I know all the movies that are going to come out in the next few months that movie doesn’t exist and well well look at here the trailers finally out 🙄😀
ySy8mcceTno,ok where is slender man if it’s about him?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie honestly looks like trash. BUT i love anything to do with slenderman so for my birthday me and my bf are going to go and see this movie. Hopefull we wont be disappointed but considering how low my expectations are im sure we'll be fine
ySy8mcceTno,Sony? No thanks.
ySy8mcceTno,"Si hacen una pelicula de slenderman, entonces debo asumir que en ese mismo universo existen también Jeff the killer y eyeless Jack?"
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho I used to be scared of him XDDD I legit just found about this LOL also you are so late but I'll still watch it XD
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, in your attempts of movie making; This is not going to help you guys.  In fact, it is going to make your reputation worse than what it already is.  Especially since this movie is based off of a video game, that was meant to be just a video game."
ySy8mcceTno,What’s the date?
ySy8mcceTno,JOHN CENA: THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a movie or a 1997 Nine Inch Nails video?
ySy8mcceTno,"All the people complaining. Man, you'll still watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,It wasn't scary at all. What is a horror movie or cringe movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like it's made on 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Nothin about their family?
ySy8mcceTno,You have taken the idea from dvloper
ySy8mcceTno,#bringtobeyback
ySy8mcceTno,What about jeff the motherfucking killer
ySy8mcceTno,Yes finally
ySy8mcceTno,Finally an urban have come true. When I am kid I really scared to hear about this folk. And now I can watch it😍😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,Ok but honestly they could do without all the “creepy” things. Because in my opinion there just gross. Like the maggots and stuff. Slender man was more about the just plain fear of him being around you. So they probably should add like a cool static sound when he’s near the person in the movie. Right?? Slender man doesn’t even have all of the weird tentacles in the movie (going by the trailer)
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie will be horrible, the story looks terrible, the trailer looks nothing like the original slenderman game, its such a dissapointement to grow up wanting a slenderman movie because you played the game your whole childhood and they make this garbage :/"
ySy8mcceTno,"They only thing that really slightly scared me was weird scenes of maggots and the eye and nail, this didn’t seem scary."
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer was fake because it's over a year old and there is still no movie
ySy8mcceTno,I downloaded the game played it 8 min and deinstallt it because its scary as hell!!!!!!!😭🤬👏🏻
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly don't think this could be more generic.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony better not mess this up
ySy8mcceTno,SERIOUSLY.........😐
ySy8mcceTno,First you are so late and second this looks like the Bye Bye Man
ySy8mcceTno,"0:27:

""Mr. Stark...I don't feel so good..."""
ySy8mcceTno,That trailer wasn't that good...i'm disappointed :( I hope it isn't rated R since even Roblox (kid's game) has a Slender Man game.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is gonna be so bad, you can see in the trailer that they missed the whole point of slenderman. It’s not even close to the original story. Just cancel this already."
ySy8mcceTno,This should have been a found footage fillm.
ySy8mcceTno,Снимите фильм ище по Джеффу Киллеру
ySy8mcceTno,Ждём кинцо)))
ySy8mcceTno,I want this movie to do well sooooooooooooooooooooo bad !!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, Sony, sony , Tardy to the party as per usual. Stick to making Ps4's and video games, it's almost like execs at Sony are on dial-up internet reading chat room posts of creepypastas from 7 yrs ago and said to themselves ""let's strike while the iron is hot and make a Slender man movie"" lol there's a reason Sony's movie and music departments are only able to stay afloat by video game sales.lol"
ySy8mcceTno,!!!???WTF???!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Huh?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought there is already a movie based on slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Don't look at slender Man or you die
ySy8mcceTno,this movie looks lame af
ySy8mcceTno,ที่ประเทศไทยเขาเรียก ผีเปรต
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer says no
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to watch this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Is that new?
ySy8mcceTno,Where is slender man tho?
ySy8mcceTno,Why the hell is this basically like the tape from the ring?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Slenderman all the children need to hide
ySy8mcceTno,Question where are u from
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is gonna be trash fanfiction is probably written better than this script

ySy8mcceTno,Whoever thinks this is “scary” think again 🙄🙄

ySy8mcceTno,I love sony
ySy8mcceTno,I love sony
ySy8mcceTno,No Eyes But Watches Everything...
ySy8mcceTno,Id rather watch venom
ySy8mcceTno,LOL i was thinking this is game trailer
ySy8mcceTno,OMG finally they made a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Who was that girl slenderina?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie about a creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,This is extremely rude to make after Payton Leutner got stabbed because of Slenderman. This is going to be the next Emoji Movie I can feel it.
ySy8mcceTno,Hope they make a granny movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Phase 1: Slender Man, Jeff the killer movie, Eyeless Jack movie, Jeff and Jane the killer sequel movie, (the cross over movie) KILLERS movie.. starring slender man, eyeless jack, jeff and Jane :)"
ySy8mcceTno,I know da movie is coming in September 21 ^_^
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be EPIC ! !
ySy8mcceTno,After this you should make a Jeff the killer film like if u agree
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the pages?
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this exist
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,This movie could be good but it can also suck. I'm still finna excites though:D
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope this isn’t gonna suck but it probably will. Smh
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yeet yeet
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late but im still going to watch it
ySy8mcceTno,"wow this looks like a mess, bye"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm satisfied and disappointed at the same time
ySy8mcceTno,Meh... better watch some gameplay than this (‘-_-)
ySy8mcceTno,Missed opportunity to make a really good slender man instead of this garbage
ySy8mcceTno,They should rate it 12+ for me to watch it im a big fan of horror and slenderman😀😀😀
ySy8mcceTno,que fodaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know if I should he hyped for this because I don't really see the original story from the games
ySy8mcceTno,K
ySy8mcceTno,Nice timing Sony Pictures you're only 5-6 years late to the Slender Man party 👤
ySy8mcceTno,please kill me
ySy8mcceTno,When is it going to be relesed
ySy8mcceTno,Since 2012 I always wanted to see a movie about Slendy
ySy8mcceTno,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,pause at 1:51 to see his face!
ySy8mcceTno,I think this movie will be a non-happy ending
ySy8mcceTno,Can I get uhhhh FNAF movie
ySy8mcceTno,Ааааа
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or does this sort of sound like a ripoff of IT
ySy8mcceTno,Ждала ждала ждала ждала и опа ДАЖДАЛАСЯ)
ySy8mcceTno,Omg i almost feel like slenderman is behind me i will subscribe
ySy8mcceTno,They should of put the slender man song in the background
ySy8mcceTno,Will this include the 8 pages and such. Cuz I’m pretty sure they are kinda switching something here.
ySy8mcceTno,Okay this is making Venom have more potential...
ySy8mcceTno,Boi’s if this is real... oh my gosh
ySy8mcceTno,this is gonna be garbage!
ySy8mcceTno,"I want this movie Ⓧ Ⓧ Ⓧ
My Creepypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,We’ve officially run out of ideas as a species
ySy8mcceTno,"This is just mindless horror, they could’ve actually made an interesting move with Slender Man, but NOOOOOOO"
ySy8mcceTno,What do any of these mindless jump scares have to do with Slender Man?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for real? A movie based on a internet urban legend?
ySy8mcceTno,Sad so sad
ySy8mcceTno,Jeez
ySy8mcceTno,"I luv it when the girl hiding behind the tree looks at Slenderman and is like 

""Oh god I'm gonna die!""

Then slender man looks at it too and he was like

""Hell no""

Then hides behind the tree with her"
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be good movie
ySy8mcceTno,0:58 when your computer got a blue screen of death
ySy8mcceTno,:0 omg
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell is going on in this movie. Probably gonna be the weirdest film.
ySy8mcceTno,when slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,😨
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this is kind of superhero
ySy8mcceTno,I’m exited
ySy8mcceTno,Um was it cancelled
ySy8mcceTno,It's gonna suck bad... With both the writer's works and the director's filmography not exceeding below average ratings...It'll be just another video game movie. It's obvious that these horrendous movies based off of video games are just a quick cash grab to gain in from the video game industry.
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie based on a flash game?

No thanks."
ySy8mcceTno,That dude throwing himself off the ledge looks EXACTLY like that one scene in The Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,What day
ySy8mcceTno,yes yes u can
ySy8mcceTno,Seems to be one of those psychological horror movies ... why is he not wearing a suit? Smh...
ySy8mcceTno,"granny , your son in law is in a movie ."
ySy8mcceTno,CantwaitforFNAFthemovie
ySy8mcceTno,"2 seconds in I clicked off, freaked me da fuq out"

ySy8mcceTno,Most anticipated film of 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Is granny in this
ySy8mcceTno,Instead of making movies of just ONE Creepypasta figure. Why not do a movie with them all? :/
ySy8mcceTno,is it a fake trailer????

ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie : Jeff The Killer

ySy8mcceTno,He better have a white face and black suit
ySy8mcceTno,What is the point of making this movie when slender man isn’t even in the movie yo these adults don’t even understand slender man what the pros do it
ySy8mcceTno,Is this ligit?
ySy8mcceTno,Probably granny will be next
ySy8mcceTno,1:34-1:35 what you wanna do when you find out the emoji movie is getting a sequel.
ySy8mcceTno,I know the idea of it I actually got some info from my cousin who is helping with the movie and he told me one thing about slender man and he told me that he makes people suicide kinda like a Freddy kouger thing
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Is enderman
ySy8mcceTno,why now
ySy8mcceTno,"Mario the movie, Resident Evil the movie and now Slenderman the movie. What's next, Getting over it the movie?"

ySy8mcceTno,I have a funny feeling that this movie won’t do particularly well
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man vs pennywise. Any excited for this crossover...?
ySy8mcceTno,This is fucking spooky
ySy8mcceTno,why so many dislikes???
ySy8mcceTno,But people forgot Slenderman though
ySy8mcceTno,Release date?
ySy8mcceTno,Bogus n stupid directors and producers
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late guys.
ySy8mcceTno,bit late but what ever
ySy8mcceTno,It's a Venom movie with a horror aspect. Lol
ySy8mcceTno,did i time travel back to 2012 or is sony reviving a dead creepypasta?

ySy8mcceTno,Is this real or fake? I don't understand 😕
ySy8mcceTno,Cringe??
ySy8mcceTno,jeff the killer movie would be amazing
ySy8mcceTno,*Oof*
ySy8mcceTno,Who else completely forgot this movie was even a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,More like the slender man movie without slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"While admittedly the trailer does look interesting, i have to agree with most of the comments and say that the slender fandom has been dead for quite a few years now."
ySy8mcceTno,"I love the game and creepypasta but to bad I'm not in the fandom but I can't stop playing slender Man and the 8 pages, and Slenderman the arrival. And I never actually jumped because I had worshipped him like 3 years or so..."
ySy8mcceTno,omg.....
ySy8mcceTno,I'm pretty excited.
ySy8mcceTno,"I have been waiting for this my whole life, Sony. Don't ruin it."
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be similar to the slender man forest stabbing story.
ySy8mcceTno,Does this mean granny and slederina and the other characters will be there?
ySy8mcceTno,"so slenderman can get his own movie but not fnaf,really"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they make a Jeff The Killer movie that would be great on he became him.
ySy8mcceTno,"everyone is complaining about how Sony is 5 years late to the whole slender man thing. They made this movie because the tale of Slender Man was thrown into the forefront lately due to the Slender Man Trial where those crazed middle schoolers lured their friend out to the woods, stabbed her 19 times as a sacrifice to Slender Man. Luckily the victim survived the attack."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no
ySy8mcceTno,Upcoming movie: Simon says..
ySy8mcceTno,"Why?..





Just why."
ySy8mcceTno,No da miedo
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Is this actually going to be a thing? if yes i would totally watch it!
ySy8mcceTno,"1:07 , 1:16, 1:23 cover your ears it's too annoying"
ySy8mcceTno,Olosko véi quero vê
ySy8mcceTno,Where slenderMan
ySy8mcceTno,But what's scary is I actually saw him looking through my window (hiding under my blankets with mac)
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting so long for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,satanaizi
ySy8mcceTno,Slendirman avcisi Yiğit abi neredesin
ySy8mcceTno,NO
ySy8mcceTno,So slender man IRL 😨😨😨😨😨 SCARY MOVIE #Can'tYouSeenHim
ySy8mcceTno,Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk CORRE NEGADA
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like it going to be a pretty decent horror. Also, I'm a fan of Slenderman, but I actually kind of hope they cut the fandom out of this movie. And stick to the good old roots of slender. Or come up with their own horrifying version of him without completely defacing him. (Pun unintended) I really hope it doesn't get cancelled."
ySy8mcceTno,Who excited!!!???
ySy8mcceTno,what garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"The creepypasta, finnaly a reality movie."
ySy8mcceTno,How did I get from Fortnite save the world videos to this?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this slendarman movie or slendrina because I haven't seen slendarman
ySy8mcceTno,AHHHH I CANNOT WAIT!!! I have watched this trailer every single day
ySy8mcceTno,when you come back to the trailer twice because marik and bakura suggested it and also to listen to gay elephant noises at 1:23 in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s FNAF when you need it?
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepypasta fans are either saying ""yes finally"" or ""6 years too late""....Well we got the movie now so yaay"
ySy8mcceTno,ي لبيييييهههههه💕
ySy8mcceTno,This is terrifying
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks kinda dumb.
Super unoriginal abd verrrryyyy late to the party. Slender man dosent get in your head abd dosent control you. He simply kills you Cause your in his woods. Why can't we leave the subject ambiguous?"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Can you add slendrina in the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,YAY YAYYAYAAY SLENDERMAN MOVIE :DDDDD
ySy8mcceTno,That's bin more than one slender move the other was quite low budget tho
ySy8mcceTno,They tried way too hard
ySy8mcceTno,"No, This is fine you're just 5 years *LATE*"
ySy8mcceTno,"I wanna watch this ""Horror Film""
."
ySy8mcceTno,So is the Slender Man movie already here or is it coming soon?
ySy8mcceTno,My italy
ySy8mcceTno,No kg no Frederic saleny and slendrina nooooo
ySy8mcceTno,Lol then slenderman got fucked y jeff the killer lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Masky and hoodie should be in this movie
And masky will be the main character
That will be cool"
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see this so baddd
ySy8mcceTno,You can say slenders dead all you want. But this looks awesome as HECK.
ySy8mcceTno,So bad!
ySy8mcceTno,;-)
ySy8mcceTno,Nunca mais eu vo dormi
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER MAN.........This film is not yet rated......ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???
ySy8mcceTno,I hope we get to see more slender
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna watch but some parts are gross
ySy8mcceTno,"No, Sony. I can't see him. He's there for a total of, like, 4 seconds."
ySy8mcceTno,i really do think a slenderman movie could be good and scary but this looks very disappointing
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is John Cena undercover!!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh slender man it is you.wow this looks like a bad moveUgh...
ySy8mcceTno,He's not even wearing the suit
ySy8mcceTno,Hijos de su puta madure por que no sale!?
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting for someone to make a movie of SLENDERMAN for a long time.
*See it*"
ySy8mcceTno,"you know for everyone saying that Sony is late on this, I can see where your right but you can thank those two girls who tried to stab their friend in the woods to call slenderman for that ...I'm sure the studios would of done this earlier...but what studio would want to put  money into a project connected to a real attempted murder...lol if they would of done it then people would of been singing a different tune ...instead they would of said things like ""too soon"" , ""how distasteful or disrespectful"" and blah blah blah...I'm sure they had to wait for all that legal stuff to blow over...after all you can't please everyone..."
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer made absolutely no sense to me
ySy8mcceTno,I. Can't. Wait...
ySy8mcceTno,It may be late. But I’m still hoping it will be at least a decent film.
ySy8mcceTno,Marik and Bakura got me here WHERES THE GAY ELEPHANT NOISE!
ySy8mcceTno,Venom vs slender man who wins?
ySy8mcceTno,every comment on every horror movie trailer: i didnt even find this scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Now I can fall asleep yes
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys you know why slender stays in the forest
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh this died like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda random time to decide to make a movie about Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,THANK U SONY  SO MUCH. oh by the way thanks!
ySy8mcceTno,Russian sleep experiment movie please
ySy8mcceTno,"2:12 That's kinda freaky, what is that??"
ySy8mcceTno,He doesn't hunt us. We hunt him
ySy8mcceTno,Iblis..
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who just cant take this seriously?
ySy8mcceTno,Why...just...why
ySy8mcceTno,When. Is. This. Coming. To. Theatres. *I. NEED. TO. KNOW.*
ySy8mcceTno,Yea....nope
ySy8mcceTno,"Where was slender man in the vid lol.
Or slender is a weird infection lol."
ySy8mcceTno,Whats worse of getting lost in the comment section or the woods?
ySy8mcceTno,You're late
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer makes no sense at all
ySy8mcceTno,Basically every  Horror Movie Trailer Clishe ever! :P
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah this is gonna be trash
ySy8mcceTno,1:31 when you forget about what your disecting in class
ySy8mcceTno,"Title of the movie : Slender Man
*only see Slender Man for 10 sec"
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the page collecting aspect to this? Does this have actually anything to do with Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,Where spider man
ySy8mcceTno,"At the end, whenever it says SLENDER MAN for a little second, I thought it said ENDER MAN, and I burst out laughing





What am I doing lol"
ySy8mcceTno,tfw slenderman is a creepypasta not a virus
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they don't bring up the attempted murder unless they had permission from the survivor and her family.
ySy8mcceTno,This still looks amateurish tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,1:52 WHO TOUCHED MY SPAGET?!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"SCP-000
Object class: Keter"
ySy8mcceTno,Im so happy this is comeing out😍😍

ySy8mcceTno,what we cant see slendy or what 😮😒
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a Ring reboot
ySy8mcceTno,"Man, where's kaneki when you need him"
ySy8mcceTno,We want CPU(Creepy Pasta Universe)
ySy8mcceTno,The parents of the actual slender man stabbing must be mad
ySy8mcceTno,When the game comes out 6 years before the film
ySy8mcceTno,"Eh, better off watching Marble Hornets rather than a movie based off a game based off Marble Hornets"
ySy8mcceTno,Why does it seem so old
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it has potential if it plays it more like a psychological thriller rather than straight up horror flick, which they seem to somewhat be doing"
ySy8mcceTno,coming soon!?!?when???
ySy8mcceTno,skinny legend
ySy8mcceTno,"Despite all cliches you put it, it sorta looks interesting. Even though, I can't get over how people used to (because his fandom is basically dead) worship a stupid meme and believing it's real."
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't care what people say, I'm still gonna watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems generic, but he at least better be wearing a suit. Otherwise, this is just a pretender."
ySy8mcceTno,Poop
ySy8mcceTno,Muy mala men
ySy8mcceTno,im actually excited now
ySy8mcceTno,Lol. I want to see this
ySy8mcceTno,Is This movie out i néed To watch

ySy8mcceTno,Looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,whats next? jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,Sub and you might get free stuff
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s so disturbing and unsettling. I like it, however your quite late on this, I mean, I still personally like slenderman and creepypasta but, there are very little of us left."
ySy8mcceTno,are we gonna see slender man's dong?
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, great job, geez, i been waiting for....how much..






...oh yea...





5 YEARS FOR THIS FRICKIN' MOVIE!!!😡😡😡😡"
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s always the same.screaming,blood,scary sounds and horrible story.😑"
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for this to release
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this will be more scary than the video games😐
ySy8mcceTno,Ata
ySy8mcceTno,2 0 1 8
ySy8mcceTno,Wow I'm a kid and I'm not scared
ySy8mcceTno,They’ll all be fine if they just walk backwards
ySy8mcceTno,Ah mi amado slenderman por fin una película de ti aww te awooooooooooooo o((*^▽^*))o (｡･ω･｡) I love you slenderman ( ˘ ³˘)❤ (⌒.−)＝★
ySy8mcceTno,don't look around the tree
ySy8mcceTno,"To me,I think this is going to be bad because slenderman was a horror game so this is a horror video game movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Comments:
70% should’ve come out 2012
20% Sony Hate
5% Emoji Movie 2
5% Creepypasta Cinematic Universe"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh... It doesn't look very good.
ySy8mcceTno,Please dubbed tamil
ySy8mcceTno,guys stop arguing its good that they made the movie though there are still slenderman lovers out there and the movie is so cool!!! i will totally take my crush to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone is complaining about the movie coming out late but if they had released it during the slenderman hype then everyone would've just called it a rushed bandwagon movie and cinolain about it
ySy8mcceTno,Me llamó 2007 quiere que le devuelvas el Creepypasta xD
ySy8mcceTno,Nao tem nem data de estreia ainda??
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, for the love of God, just sell off the rights to your movie franchise. Please?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ma non c'aveva la faccia bianca ???
ySy8mcceTno,What month will it came?
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next Jeff the killer v Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Spider man?
ySy8mcceTno,i can't wait for a release date
ySy8mcceTno,is sony stuck in 2013 or something
ySy8mcceTno,ghatiya yaaar accha banaya kro tum log marvel ke saath accha bana sakte ho
ySy8mcceTno,So this is where symbiote comes from. Lol
ySy8mcceTno,"If you want to make a Slenderman movie, please, know what fans what. Such as, add more of the actual cannon creepypastas. There is no background of the woods, either. Any creepypasta fans with me?"
ySy8mcceTno,it so much more disturbing if you watch it on speed 0.25!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,i remember hearing about this years ago and being pumped but the slenderman fan base is dead besides the creepypasta people
ySy8mcceTno,why???
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad..
ySy8mcceTno,Ποτε βγαίνει;
ySy8mcceTno,"SLENDERMAN = VENOM
SHITTY HORROR MOVIES WITH A SHITTY TRAILER.....  WELL PLAYED SONY, WELL F**CKING PLAYED!"
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this all my life.
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the Five Nights At Freddy's movie in 2025
ySy8mcceTno,I Want to see it
ySy8mcceTno,fake! ;(
ySy8mcceTno,what you move 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
ySy8mcceTno,Why isn't Tim Burton doing this? The theme looks like something he would do.
ySy8mcceTno,This movies coming out on my birthday
ySy8mcceTno,Okay My cousins are watching it(well renting it on their tv)and I'm like NVM but I'm still gonna watch it antways
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: *knows it's really fucking late*
Me: *knows it's probably a cash grab*
Me: *knows it's probably gonna be really fucking bad*
Also me: AHM SO FUCKIN EXCITED IMMA SEE DIS IN THEATRES!"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm excited to not watch this and read the negative reviews as the film dies in obscurity
ySy8mcceTno,Fucking..........this movie is not really........this movie is just action.and slandermen is not really!
ySy8mcceTno,Massa
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so hyped to see Annalise Basso again.
ySy8mcceTno,the *HELL* did I just watch?!
ySy8mcceTno,'being late' is a stupid thing to complain about who cares? how long a thing has been around is completely irrelevant to anything if you're going to hate it hate it for actual reasons
ySy8mcceTno,I had no idea what was happening.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slendrina is daughter of Slenderman,  with her mother,  husband and her baby."
ySy8mcceTno,"So, anyone who feels tempted to watch this, don't. Watch Marble Hornets web series instead. Its an amazing show that plays on creepiness instead of random horror jumcuts and jumpscares and it does so on a much lower budget than this."
ySy8mcceTno,1:22 more symbiote than in the venom trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Wow can't believe it's real seen the same poster today st the movies so I had to make sure u seen it right
ySy8mcceTno,"YEEEEEEESSSSS YEEEEESSSSSSSS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS"
ySy8mcceTno,No. Just no.
ySy8mcceTno,The sequel is SLENDER WOMAN WITH BIG BOOBIES.. now that I wanna see!
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be absolutely crazy and should be cool. I definitely am looking forward to it.
ySy8mcceTno,"As a HUGE creepypasta fan, I'm scared. I want it to be good.  Its going to be STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE, it's going to have gross black and white imagery just to look scary and the imagery is gonna be nothing but pointless and just to LOOK scary. I'm more horrified that Slender man character can be given injustice, and that sony now have the rights."
ySy8mcceTno,"Thank you, Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged for making Slender Man not scary!"
ySy8mcceTno,Dead
ySy8mcceTno,Hella late on this train guys...
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys it's been 5-6 years, and it's just now that we got a movie. This better be good."
ySy8mcceTno,"This has to be as good as the lore, games, pasta, and wiki."
ySy8mcceTno,Your kind of late with movie... Are you even planing on showing Slender Man in the actual movie or is just going to be other people shown and not hi. ? :/
ySy8mcceTno,já me vejo gritando no cinema
ySy8mcceTno,*_O M G_*
ySy8mcceTno,#2scary4me
ySy8mcceTno,"On top of this being late, it looks very stupid."
ySy8mcceTno,2030?
ySy8mcceTno,So much of the imagery in this trailer was identical to The Ring
ySy8mcceTno,Sony should've just sticked to the game and i can already tell this Will end up bad for Them.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,DORMITABIS - Teaser Trailer (This Film Not Rated / 2018)
ySy8mcceTno,My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
ySy8mcceTno,"Why ? , Parsec is not in the Production of the movie ?"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this movie has his backstory
ySy8mcceTno,Of course sony pictures picks up this joke of an idea
ySy8mcceTno,I literally thought someone was whistling 💀 but.. I realized it was my phone
ySy8mcceTno,"You mislabeled the bad guy. Nothing about this trailer says ""Slender Man"". Nothing about this trailer is scary. An amateur video game dev can make a scary slender man. A few kids with a camera can make slender man scary, intriguing, and mysterious. A massive company with millions invested in a Hollywood movie? Garbage. Absolute garbage. This isn't slender man. This is half assed trash"
ySy8mcceTno,This is the most cliche movie trailer I've ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like, The Ring"
ySy8mcceTno,"I had a strange dream a long time ago before I New about slender man, it was a average day my people were watching tv then I go into my room and there he was I screamed but no one could here me and then I woke up"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks really scary and professionally to me  Idk what everybody is talking about saying negative hate.
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if this has Slenderman’s proxy Ticci Toby
ySy8mcceTno,When you realize bleach is harmful. 0:59
ySy8mcceTno,"Even though S man is less popular doesn’t mean it’s not scary.

Also this creature was born in a fantastic way by a creative mind let’s be thankful we have stuff like this instead of more crappy horror movies."
ySy8mcceTno,"At last, he has come to end us all."
ySy8mcceTno,lol
ySy8mcceTno,im scared
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhhh now I remember isn't this guy that faceless dude scaring 9 year olds with herobrine back in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Jeff the killer is next,then ej,LJ,Ben drowned.. U guys continue XDD"
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepypasta fams,where are u guys??? (Sry for the bad English)"
ySy8mcceTno,1:50 clicks off video
ySy8mcceTno,He's a joke now. lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Ich check grad gar nix
ySy8mcceTno,SONY DO YOU WANT HAVE A BAD TOM!
ySy8mcceTno,>_<
ySy8mcceTno,sony this look like a fan made
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,xD this trailer da best
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting forever for a creepy pasta movie lol dont be a let down!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Too bad the majority of the CreepyPasta fandom is dead
ySy8mcceTno,Can we get an SCP movie now? Please..?
ySy8mcceTno,"#CanYouSeeHim 
Slenderman just became the new John Cena"
ySy8mcceTno,After those two girls stabbed another girl in a forest cause they said slenderman told them too that was their cue.
ySy8mcceTno,Um some of these clips are from movies from a while ago or just in general
ySy8mcceTno,Their doing this to bring back the story of slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Umm the producer of slender man I kisser got a call from 2012-2013 saying they want they’re movie back.
ySy8mcceTno,When is this coming out
ySy8mcceTno,probably be bad as hell just like every other game movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes I can see him
ySy8mcceTno,2012(:
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or this trailer is giving me The Ring vibes?
ySy8mcceTno,I knew after them little girls did that 2 her friend it would become a movie. Wasted no time 😒
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see this but... will it be good?
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait...so it wasn’t fan made? Oh, cool. I kinda wanna watch it now 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,soooo slenderman the movie without slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Why did i want this to show ticci toby and mask and hoddie
ySy8mcceTno,when q la pongan con loquendo >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Saw this as a trailer while seeing a quiet place...I wanted to scream
ySy8mcceTno,Let's make this popular again! #ReviveSlender
ySy8mcceTno,Not bad...
ySy8mcceTno,I'm probably only going to see it due to a huge nostalgia rush. I don't have high expectations though.
ySy8mcceTno,The emoji movie of Horror
ySy8mcceTno,leaves that day?
ySy8mcceTno,Its dis real?
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer was so creepy!!! 😱😱😱👍👍👍Good job,I am impressed!👍✌"
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer was so creepy!!! 😱😱😱👍👍👍Good job,I am impressed!👍✌"
ySy8mcceTno,Dear lord the creepypasta fandom is about to get revived help us all
ySy8mcceTno,well.....this is beutyfull.......yup
ySy8mcceTno,What about Jeff the killer or smile dog or the rake ?
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys you can't just judge the movie by the trailer you have to see it first, I'm going to say it looks really good and scary, yes Ik it's a little late but still, we are getting a fricken slender man movie guys XD"
ySy8mcceTno,S-s-s-scary I’m gonna kill myself ahhhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie : Sonic . EXE 
XD"
ySy8mcceTno,I can tell this is going to be the next horrible movie let’s just hope it’s not as bad as..th-the- the emoji movie...
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this was supposed to come out years ago, you know, when slender man was still relevant."
ySy8mcceTno,Boring.
ySy8mcceTno,Holy *SMOKES* *!* SLENDER! THE MOVIE?! like come on ! it has been like some years ago since the game came out.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim? Can't Wait! :D
ySy8mcceTno,I love this but I really wanted to see slender man😔
ySy8mcceTno,"Tbh this doesn't really seem all that faithful to the source material. Like, slenderman kinda gets in peoples heads with the static/glitches, but the random paranoia and making ppl commit suicide??? Nah. Also what abt the notes in the woods???? Collect all the notes an you ""win"" the game, if they dont stick to that process in the movie imma be mad tbh."
ySy8mcceTno,6 years later...
ySy8mcceTno,don't even depict him in the suit wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony I have three things to say 
1. Your late to the party that happened 6 years ago 
2. Everyone hopped off that fandom page already 
3. Your mom gay"
ySy8mcceTno,"People complain this movie seems to be nothing like the games.

May I remind you that Slenderman didn't originate from some average 3D horror game, it originated in a photoshop contest or whatever. So I wouldn't class this as a video game movie which is at least promising."
ySy8mcceTno,*@TIANETFLIX*
ySy8mcceTno,😱😱😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,IS COMING IN 17MAY
ySy8mcceTno,It should have been a found footage
ySy8mcceTno,hey @sony pictures would you mind private messaging me through YouTube or find me on facebook
ySy8mcceTno,Baby do people do this wonderland is being judged its just myths and cables a nd stories but I think he is real and a amazing person he cares and loves but nobody loves him he I want to make a change too that I believe in him comment it u do aswell
ySy8mcceTno,Better than never
ySy8mcceTno,Next is Slendrina: The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve never heard a theory of slender man that sounds legit. I can’t wait.
ySy8mcceTno,Por eso hay tanto sicópatas en gringolandia
ySy8mcceTno,This is a fake! If this was a real film I would have known about it! This is probably a bunch of pretend actors because the actors in this film don't even look like real actors. I know you might think that is a bit mean but I am a true actor myself and a lot of people know about. e.g. I was 'Oliver' in the musical and it was in the Arbroath Herrald. Look if you don't believe me. Just to let you know I was 'Oliver' from the 13th to the 17th of February 2018! THIS IS A FAKE!
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah I can’t wait!!
ySy8mcceTno,Hype
ySy8mcceTno,WTF is this?!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Is slender man going to be real or is he going to be an imaginary monster?
ySy8mcceTno,Put this trailer and  the trailer to THE RING! and the images are very very similar in style!
ySy8mcceTno,"I didnt see slenderman clear, its maybe fake??"
ySy8mcceTno,It would be better if they based this movie from The Arrival
ySy8mcceTno,1:51
ySy8mcceTno,This is the worst trailer I've ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,1:39 i didn't notice that he teleported right next to her like that. you can see his tie when he teleports. that is more creepy than i thought.
ySy8mcceTno,It’s the ring all over again
ySy8mcceTno,0:59 When your Mom tells you that you’re grounded.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony please scrap this movie. The lore behind the slenderman is so rich and full of exploration. Nobody needs another “where is my daughter!?” Horror movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Marble Hornets beat you to the punch.
No, the actual Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,Donde mierda estan mis cartas
ySy8mcceTno,"the age of these kind of ""funny"" scary movies is over. I don't see any creativity in these recent films and I am sure I am not alone who not enjoy these films."
ySy8mcceTno,"I think slender man is not a movie character, it's better in games"
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that they made a movie based on a trend is an all time low for Hollywood.
ySy8mcceTno,Sinister 3
ySy8mcceTno,whoah
ySy8mcceTno,oh....no.....
ySy8mcceTno,"I live in Massachusetts
Btw I know the Slenderman is a dead CreepyPasta, but this could revive it.........or completely fail. I hope it revives it tho."
ySy8mcceTno,That’s why you never live near the woods kids!
ySy8mcceTno,Q
ySy8mcceTno,I was actually so excited to see this... after watching this trailer... not so much anymore. Thought it’d be better than this
ySy8mcceTno,Blender Man is new hero for X-men?
ySy8mcceTno,Ggx gang
ySy8mcceTno,Omg at 1:30
ySy8mcceTno,Tô louco pra vê esse filme 🙌
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like I seen a bunch of suicides and that's it thanks Sony
ySy8mcceTno,los q hablan español y no entienden nada de los q hablan ingles presentense :v
ySy8mcceTno,It s not scary
ySy8mcceTno,It’s as though this movie went down the checklist of horror movie tropes...
ySy8mcceTno,I don't see slender anywhere were is my brother slender come on come out 1 like = 1 dollar to help slendy
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe Granny movie now?
ySy8mcceTno,"Who's the daughter, Kate the chaser? Seems like it might be."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait  to  see  the full movie😲😲
ySy8mcceTno,*TOP 10 FOOTAGE OF SLENDERMAN*
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder why they haven’t been releasing any other teasers or content.
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy is dead
ySy8mcceTno,"ya dun goofed, sony. ya dun goofed."
ySy8mcceTno,Cool
ySy8mcceTno,There's fashionably late and then theres this
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,"Ahh who cares if you're late on something? That's what I hate about people. Don't expect people to live to the standards and keep up with the trends because it's not an obligation. At the very least we are getting a legit Slendy film that, I hope, would be better than that one with the Operator thing."
ySy8mcceTno,The actor of slender man has a rare condition which makes others body parts taller than his other ones
ySy8mcceTno,CREEPYPASTA FANS? :)..
ySy8mcceTno,"There was potential... and then the clichés came to the dance floor. Why are all ""horror"" movies driven down the same deep ruts?"
ySy8mcceTno,"SCP Movie > Slenderman Movie 

Please, I beg you. Please."
ySy8mcceTno,Thats not slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,¿Donde está Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,Que boxta em
ySy8mcceTno,I was gonna ask what age you have to be to see this but now I've seen the trailer um.... nevermind
ySy8mcceTno,I've seen a rock do better acting in hentai movies
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not impressed, I mean seriously.......Slender man!?"
ySy8mcceTno,Put on headphones and the marker will overtake all the sounds if it was played throughout the trailer instead of the few scenes
ySy8mcceTno,When did this come out..?
ySy8mcceTno,Weeeeeeeeeeeeird
ySy8mcceTno,a few years late on this aren't you sony the slender man hype died a long time ago and everyone has moved to the next thing whatever that is currently
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman has a movie?! Im suprised!
ySy8mcceTno,A movie based off a fad years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,"Reasons why this movie would fail so bad:
1. You are (5 years) too late
2. Sony Pictures (Marvel nailed Spiderman in 15 minutes where Sony couldn’t do it in 5 movies)
3. Slender man is not wearing a suit"

ySy8mcceTno,good film
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else feel like they just saw a trailer for another “the ring” movie??
ySy8mcceTno,"I honestly feel that they didn't stay true to the legend... It looks good, but doesn't make me think slenderman, it makes me think stranger things."
ySy8mcceTno,okay
ySy8mcceTno,Sooo excited to watch this movie!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope they arent trying to start a Creepypasta Cinematic Universe
ySy8mcceTno,"To late bro. Like , 7 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,"If you guys don't take a photoshoot of the guy in costume of Slender I am going to flip. Backflip, frontflip, cartwheel, who knows?"
ySy8mcceTno,The music at the beginning was starting to kill my ears even with out headphones
ySy8mcceTno,im seeing this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Probably a big ask here, and they probably won't do it because it requires too much....... depth and wouldn't make sense if you didn't play the game, but it would be cool if they made a tie in or an easter Egg/reference to the arrival, maybe include the Mathesons in it? Probably won't happen,Would be really cool though"
ySy8mcceTno,My 12 year old self would screaming my head off right now I’ve been waiting for this for so long
ySy8mcceTno,ojala no se como la de HBO :l
ySy8mcceTno,This is still cool tho. Even though you're 6 years late.. this kinda awakens the Slenderman once more.
ySy8mcceTno,So what is this movie about: Hey guys i have to look for 10 pictures from a girl donno why.
ySy8mcceTno,tên bộ phim là anh chàng mỏng manh

All the other slender man movies were found footage films

We already saw that through marble hornets, Everymanhrbrid, tribetwelve and Dark Harvest

I was waiting for someone to make a movie in the style but I’m sure this is going to be bad anyway"

ySy8mcceTno,This is very much like stranger things but stranger things is better but I really want to see this movie I can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,Dato: Slenderman es Dios.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally i read creepypasta since 2011 or 12 and there's a lot of fanmade slendy movies but now it's official.I hope this movie more Psychological horror rather than cheap horror who shows slenderman 1000times with a mouth.Please don't do it.
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I always watch this kind of videos at night
ySy8mcceTno,I can't to see this :)
ySy8mcceTno,This makes no sense at all
ySy8mcceTno,This looks kinda pathetic in MY opinion so don't want to offend anyone that's a fan of the slenderman but this looks terrible and sounds terrible this whole trailer didn't even come close to scaring me it seems cheap with no effort (so far) and seems like its being made to make a quick buck then actually scare people if your offended by MY opinion sorry but again its just a opinion and if your excited to see this movie go ahead I don't have any reason to stop anyone from watching a movie they want to watch
ySy8mcceTno,Quando esce il film??
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmmm... I don’t know about how good this movie is going to be. It does look interesting, I will admit. I’ll just have to wait until the movie comes out before I judge."
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember when Slender Man was like, the scariest thing on the Internet. That was years ago"

ySy8mcceTno,I hope they still somehow implement the 8 Pages thing. Slenderman was pretty big during the old days kek.

ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is not real
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer is confusing for me. I can't tell if it's low budget, high, or in between lol I hope it's good but I have my reservations ... I love the slenderman story and I think it would make for an amazing movie/series. If it's made right."
ySy8mcceTno,There's no way it'll be better than Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone explain what the hell this is because it does not look like slender and if this came out 5 years ago it would make more sense cause of slender being popular.
ySy8mcceTno,I like this kind of infection aproach to slenderman(operator/how ever you like to call him) like marble hornets showed it
ySy8mcceTno,So is this movie based on the attempted murder case or the creepypasta itself?

ySy8mcceTno,I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,"The only good thing about slender man was the fact that we didn't know much about him. Just like anything else that's supposed to be scary. We usually don't know what they can do, what they look like (at least in detail) and don't know why it exists.
But that isn't the case, cause we DO know about Slender man. We know enough to make him into a joke. He isn't scary and only thing scary about him is two teenage girls going too far."
ySy8mcceTno,😒😒😒
ySy8mcceTno,"Just got back from seeing ""Ready Player One"" comment below if you saw the movie





I came upon the poster and saw ""Slender Man"" I'm a huge fan of the game and I've been waiting for this type of movie for years

ySy8mcceTno,"I love slender man, but you are a bit late (only a decade) and if you want to draw more people in you need to make it based on story and lore but most importantly you shouldn't use the eight pages. The page collecting system works well for games sure, but movies? No, you need to make a unique story with some twists, but I can see how it would be tough to make a movie based around such a complex character."

ySy8mcceTno,The only thing that would get me to watch this is if 2pm's Slenderman song was in it.
ySy8mcceTno,this is too spooky for me
ySy8mcceTno,"I think the movie was made in time but because of the incident this two girls who killed for Slenderman could not get it out, or, they were inspired by that case."
ySy8mcceTno,I bet that little girl that killed her friend in real life and is now in prison for it can't wait for this movie to come out. I hope they don't add in the teachings of slender Man and how your suppose to do what he says or he will kill you. Isn't that why the little girl and her friend stabbed another girl in a bathroom to death?
ySy8mcceTno,"When it will be showing??
I want to watch it!!"

ySy8mcceTno,still waiting for the BEN Drowned movie
ySy8mcceTno,This looks soooooooooo bad. Slender man should stay on youtube where it belongs. Scaring 10 year olds. Odd miss for Sony.

ySy8mcceTno,Look dumb
ySy8mcceTno,#he can see you
ySy8mcceTno,The one thing I can say for sure that will be good in this movie is that the creature actor who is going to be portraying Slender man is Javier Botet.
ySy8mcceTno,i love this
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello fellow people! <3
This trailer is coming when it’s my birthday!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Mistakes
1. Shouldn't It come out in 2013? Because its the scariest game there...
2. It doesn't even in the same backstory of the game
3. If its from Slender : the arrival it should have charlie and some stuff
4. Don't tell me its from the original Slender game"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is not scary and I hope this movie flops. I also hope everyone losses money for this garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,First 3 sconds i bale
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, it's pretty clear that the makers of this have no idea what made slenderman scary in the first place, although it is hard to blame them since it seems no one has in a long time.
Slenderman started as these creepy old photos where there was a slender man with a suit and a blur for a face simply standing in the background of scenes like children playing and such, it kindof plays on the same kind of creeping horror as it, a being that seems to lure in children with any kind of authority figures either being oblivious or apathetic to it's presence.
But then the game came out and was followed by torrents of shitty fan fiction that cemented his image as a generic monster known for his jumpscares and typical horror cliches."
ySy8mcceTno,I swear this is connected to the ring
ySy8mcceTno,Cade os BR amante de filmes de terror?

ySy8mcceTno,Finally waited forever
ySy8mcceTno,"*O SANGUE DE JESUS TEM PODER, TEM PODER, TEM PODER, FAZ O INFERNO TREMESSE É O SATANÁS CORRER!*"
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone keeps saying they dislike the concwpt of this film. However I love the Slenderman as I aslways have and yet I still think this movie looks freaking awesome! Hopefully it wont suck it could but i hope not its got potential to be great.
ySy8mcceTno,BR alguém?
ySy8mcceTno,I knew it Dana Friend Todd is demon he kills the Girls that not good see
ySy8mcceTno,IM SCARED NOW I AINT FRICKIN SLEEPING
ySy8mcceTno,#youcanseehim
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this my whole life!
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait! If Slenderman is a Creepypasta so will be film about Jeff the killer, Proxy or something?"
ySy8mcceTno,4 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,This is the scariest movie I’ve ever seen wow
ySy8mcceTno,I'm gonna go see this
ySy8mcceTno,Just wait until the Ugandan Knuckles movie comes out in 2026
ySy8mcceTno,esse jogo era mt loco
ySy8mcceTno,slow clap slow clap slow clap
ySy8mcceTno,can not wait.
ySy8mcceTno,This is more of a Rings movie
ySy8mcceTno,i'm very excited for this movie simply because of how nostalgic it is. it's been almost ten years since it was created and became popular.
ySy8mcceTno,Esse filme vai ser uma merdaaaa n tem nada a ver com o slender classico
ySy8mcceTno,RUN FOR THE BUSHES
ySy8mcceTno,He's not there at 1:40 and he s there and u can see suit at 1:44
ySy8mcceTno,Its coming may 18th on Friday
ySy8mcceTno,Because Sony made this I was hoping they'd put from the people who brought you the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time!
ySy8mcceTno,Quando !!!!!?
ySy8mcceTno,What is the released date
ySy8mcceTno,"And later comes Jeff the Killer 
and Smiledog?😂"
ySy8mcceTno,#SlenderManFilm
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for this movie! But I just hope you'll be able to actually see him in the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer merely shows creepy footage and doesn't really tell us what the film is about
ySy8mcceTno,That movie to my opinion is too much
ySy8mcceTno,Meu brioco fecho num jeito que vcs n tem noção ;--;
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim?
ySy8mcceTno,I am so looking forward to this movie. Ever since i got into creepypasta I've been wanting a Slenderman movie. I can't wait to see it. And this kids is why we don't do freaky rituals in the woods to summon powerful entities. Who else thinks they should make a Jeff the Killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,So did they find the 8 pages yet?
ySy8mcceTno,How come there's no fnaf movie yet
ySy8mcceTno,Muito bom
ySy8mcceTno,!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie would've DEFINITELY benefitted more if they made/released it when they originally planned to; at the peak of Slender/slenderman's popularity. I personally think it's a bit distasteful to do it now, considering what those two girls did (even . though that was awhile ago, wasn't one of them sentenced last fall or something?) Plus, the fact that it doesnt really look like how Slender (or the creepypasta) was originally portrayed is another downside.

Anyway, excited for the memes. but i'll take marble hornets over this trash any day."
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if someone in the movie is going to find all eight pages
ySy8mcceTno,It would be better if there was sound affects from the original slender the 8 pages
ySy8mcceTno,If you gona do thes sony then plese follo slenders mythology.slenderman isent jost a killer.
ySy8mcceTno,ANA SİKEN SLENDERMAN  TRAILER
ySy8mcceTno,At least this'll be funnier than ghostbusters 2016
ySy8mcceTno,Whats
ySy8mcceTno,I am a turtle/crow
ySy8mcceTno,Took you long enough
ySy8mcceTno,Is this REAL MOVIE or FAKE?
ySy8mcceTno,bao h chieu khong biet
ySy8mcceTno,Slender the Arrival looks more interesting than this
ySy8mcceTno,This makes no sense
ySy8mcceTno,Could be better
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY GOD! THE FILM OF THE SLENDERMAN 😊 I LOVE IT ❤
ySy8mcceTno,Rings wannabe
ySy8mcceTno,This could either be trash or bring creepypasta back to life
ySy8mcceTno,i wish they didnt cut thee eye
ySy8mcceTno,!@#$%^^%$#@!@#$%^%$#@!@#$%^^^^^^%$#@!@#$%^
ySy8mcceTno,Que bosta👌
ySy8mcceTno,This is just gonna be a youtuber’s lost footage that they didn’t upload
ySy8mcceTno,Yep... Gonna be a flop 😂
ySy8mcceTno,he is not terrible! I love his story!
ySy8mcceTno,"Llegan tarde....
15 años tarde :v"
ySy8mcceTno,Deberian darle mas protagonsimo a slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't mind the movie coming 5 years late, it's just I don't think it's gonna be so great."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe this is actually happening
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look bad
ySy8mcceTno,I swear if I go back into my emo phase🙃
ySy8mcceTno,So is slender man finally getting a movie I hope it's really good and I hope they don't cancel it like they did with the other one but then agin the other one looked poop
ySy8mcceTno,Have U guys tryout the Slender man game? for PC..
ySy8mcceTno,0:58 When your boss says you have to work during spring break week
ySy8mcceTno,One slender boi
ySy8mcceTno,a horror game that is now a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 the only good part
ySy8mcceTno,we all knew this was going to happen eventually.
ySy8mcceTno,Tragam suas fraldas! Pois vai ser aterrorizante
ySy8mcceTno,Uhhhh... well then... this is much scarier then the game....
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,The movie should be about those two girls who stabbed that other girl. I would probaby watch that.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg slende game slende movie  (i br )
ySy8mcceTno,"So che ci sono due tipi di duomo nero, quello orribile e cattivo ma esiste un angelo nero simile a Dio. Lo stesso e' perslenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,"I know there are TOW blakman, the orribol and bad , bat ther's an angel black similare of Hood. So si of Slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,1:45 really scared me
ySy8mcceTno,"It's distasteful to release this after the stabbing of that girl? Maybe you should teach your kid to tell fiction from reality. Stop trying to ruin the movie, its gonna happen and it'll either be bad or good jesus christ thats all there is to it"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't get it
ySy8mcceTno,Should of made a Rake movie instead he’s way scarier anyway.
ySy8mcceTno,Cant eait
ySy8mcceTno,90% of these comments are from 12 year olds
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is horror
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is horrifying. This guy even inspired some real life murders in some messed up kids. Watching this trailer is dissapointing. It's like one of those trailers you can tell a movie is bad before you even watch it. Sad to see a story with such horrifying potential go to waste.
ySy8mcceTno,2:22 Enderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Uhhhmmmmm, what’s with all the suicides???? Are they ""scarred for life"" survivors of Slenderman attacks?? And also, the girl at the end, has she been possessed by Slenderman? If so, that is a great reference to the game called ""Slenderman the Arrival"" (I think that’s what it’s called)."
ySy8mcceTno,Bad movie...A girl stabbed her friend cause she thought slender the stupid man was going to get her.......
ySy8mcceTno,Now we need Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,"Eh, this is gonna be a low budget film, actings gonna suck, graphics gonna suck, it'll look more like a bad indie game then an actual movie. Maybe if we could turn the SlenderMan into a demon and have the dudes who made Annabelle, it would be good. But this, this looks like a fanmade movie based off a FanFiction a 13 yr old just getting into to writing produced late one night after watching to many let's plays."
ySy8mcceTno,La verdad no se ve tan chida :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Well that’s the most generic trailer I’ve ever seen, like cmon  Sony will it kill you do something creative with this trailer and why didn’t do this movie sooner like when slender man was actually good?"
ySy8mcceTno,What happens when Movie producers need ideas so much that they go for a fandom
ySy8mcceTno,I wish they made a movie of all the creepypastas It would be a dream come true
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer sucked!
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Vs Genderuwo
ySy8mcceTno,Wow ^_^
ySy8mcceTno,When slender man is right next to the  girl its like your crazy ex
ySy8mcceTno,No god please no!!
ySy8mcceTno,Man this movie is like 10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Where's Dan and Phill?
ySy8mcceTno,Boo
ySy8mcceTno,Finly
ySy8mcceTno,I saw nothing in this trailer that even remotely reminds me of the Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,Pyschological horror is the best kind
ySy8mcceTno,# canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Brasil
ySy8mcceTno,This is giving flashbacks of the avatar film
ySy8mcceTno,Now make a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,slender man!
ySy8mcceTno,oh my god
ySy8mcceTno,Is a good traler but it breaks slender mans ruls sssssooooo yhea
ySy8mcceTno,"Yo pray for me im gonna watch it on Full screen.....Dude please pray for me,Thats flippin creepy"
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie actually has nothing to do with the game
Are the pages you have to collect even mentioned in the trailer?or the movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, no."
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late...
ySy8mcceTno,"Vão estragar a História do slender man, só com essas imagens ja da pra prever que vão ser atuações péssimas cenas mal feitas e uma figura sem graça do bichão. Vamos investir mais pra não fazer cagada Sony sua linda?"
ySy8mcceTno,Staring robert bobroczky.. Go head an copy an paste that name ...your welcome
ySy8mcceTno,watch in a few years time they will come out with  a ugandan knuckles movie
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for a slender man movie for like forever about time there's one
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,❤
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be another cheesy movie like The Snowman.
ySy8mcceTno,"Funny thing is....







This movie is real"
ySy8mcceTno,#canuseehim
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good.

ySy8mcceTno,"I want the Popeye movie, Sony! :("
ySy8mcceTno,Cannot wait!
ySy8mcceTno,Can you belive that Slender started in 4chan and now it's a movie? Next time: Slendytubbies The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Whose here watching the trailer after there have watched the movie.. 🔥
ySy8mcceTno,"Nostalgia... Should've come out a couple of years ago, but I'll still see this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Its just sad after a year a scary object will now be meme
ySy8mcceTno,bu heqiqewtdi
ySy8mcceTno,jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,eye stabbing is bcming a trend
ySy8mcceTno,"1:23 yes, that is indeed a gay elephant noise."
ySy8mcceTno,i bet that your only going to see slender man for 5 seconds in the whole movie but everyone talks about him
ySy8mcceTno,"I swear to god, if this turns into Ghostbusters 2016, I will never buy anything from Sony ever again.  I don't have very high hopes for this though."
ySy8mcceTno,Do you guys know how Slender man is spotted around the world and watch a documentary about it he is real i know it and i believe in him 100%
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I’m so scared but excited at the same time!!
ySy8mcceTno,i am so ready for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Thats not how slenderman works
ySy8mcceTno,Me caguei
ySy8mcceTno,Finally after 5 years waiting
ySy8mcceTno,"Umm, won't this be more stabbing fuel?"
ySy8mcceTno,O m g what is up 2012? Where you been???
ySy8mcceTno,Im hyped
ySy8mcceTno,SONY PORFAVOR NO LA CAGES CON SLENDERMAN POR UNA VES DAMEME UNA BUENA PELICULA
ySy8mcceTno,OMG !!! SLENDER MAN MOVIE !!! LIKE 5 YEARS TOO LATE !!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,It's like Jason and Pennywise got an abortion but the child survived with severe brain damage
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time
ySy8mcceTno,Cuando sale?
ySy8mcceTno,"I desperately want this movie to be good, but from the director's past works, I really don't think it will happen."
ySy8mcceTno,I think that this is actually a pretty good trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I was promised an elephant noise by marik and now I'm dissatisfied
ySy8mcceTno,I played on ROBLOX stop it slender im ready
ySy8mcceTno,Sonic.exe movie is coming from 2019 :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Esta película representa la tarea que le dices al profe que vas a entregar y nunca se la entregas, y luego ya casi saliendo de la secundaria por risas se la entregas :v"
ySy8mcceTno,Boringg..
ySy8mcceTno,insult movie
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope this is pg13 not r.. My daughter loves scary stuff and slender man is one of her favorites but they always have to ruin horror movies by turning them into porn. I really hope this one isnt like that.
ySy8mcceTno,"i hope they went through the slenderverse and did research,"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no 😨😨😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,:D SSSLLLEEENNNDDDEEERRRMMMAAANNN YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,repoio
ySy8mcceTno,"This is my kind off movie I love creepypastas horror movies, movies based on those same creepypastas and so on I'm looking forward to This"
ySy8mcceTno,"Definitely on the fence with this one, like I want a slenderman movie but the hype for it is long gone, the trailer was pretty erratic, didn’t seem to follow the story of slender man, but it just a trailer and it could be a good movie, I have seen trailers that were awesome and the movie didn’t live up the hype"
ySy8mcceTno,habra una referencia a jeff?
ySy8mcceTno,Wjy not just a whole creepypasta movie? Id enjoy that even more.
ySy8mcceTno,D hora
ySy8mcceTno,"Well ... this trailer has nothing to do with theories, stories, and especially the game !!! I hope this movie is not bad like the death Note from netflix ... but honestly ... I found that this trailer is not according to the original things."
ySy8mcceTno,Don't worry Logan Paul will find them
ySy8mcceTno,iiii'm so gonna watch this
ySy8mcceTno,We're just going to ignore the fact that that Sony is making a movie about a picture that was made for a meme contest in 2009
ySy8mcceTno,👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,this movie looks so scary
ySy8mcceTno,still sucks slender the arrival good at then
ySy8mcceTno,Remake the whole movie and just have Slenderman walk through a town slaughtering people and Military and then you will have my money.
ySy8mcceTno,"[bunch of nonsensical horror jumps and disturbing imagery]
""Well, here's your movie!"""
ySy8mcceTno,This is to fake for me
ySy8mcceTno,So long for just a bad movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man the movie, did you mean: Running through the forest with a shaky camera for two hours like every other horror movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,I own a very similar shirt the girl is wearing at 2:15-2:19... 😳 I've had it for years
ySy8mcceTno,"This barely even matches the fucking creepypasta itself, makes no sense and is 5 years late. This is utter trash."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenda:Hello children 
Person:Ahhhhh help me 
Slenda:all I want is a hug😭😭😭😭😭"
ySy8mcceTno,I love how a creepy pasta actually made it to being a Hollywood film 😂
ySy8mcceTno,i HONESTLY try my best to like it and rewatch and rewatch.. but i can’t...😬
ySy8mcceTno,1:16 when you watch the wrong trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Only like the end of that had to do with slender man everything else was just creepy stuff and suicide
ySy8mcceTno,i dont understand....
ySy8mcceTno,Yes finally thank you Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fake or real
ySy8mcceTno,Can the next movie be jiff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,A creepypasta is going to be a real movie!!!!!!?????? Cool
ySy8mcceTno,"this movie will be the best movie ever





oh wait its not 2012 any more"
ySy8mcceTno,I ❤ slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Me now view the mowie !
ySy8mcceTno,Who's here to find the Johnathan gay elephant noise at 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,the king of creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Shut up
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t this just IT but actually scary
ySy8mcceTno,"If Slender Man is not located on Oakside with not the same story of Slender: The Arrival Game

I'll come back here and dislike the video"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys wanna explore the woods at 3am?!
ySy8mcceTno,I would have much rather preferred a Jeff the Killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should be about the sony company looking for 8 pages that lead to making a good movie while being chased by raging people and a movie company that makes far better movies and the sony comapany must surrvive this horror
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,👍👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,0:58 When you wake up on Monday
ySy8mcceTno,Wow girl:Omg AHHHHHHHH SLENDER:COME AND BE MY BEEEEEEEEST DAUGHTER *kidnaps her
ySy8mcceTno,"Geeeeez, these guys are so late.
The movie looks crappy, slender man is barely in it."
ySy8mcceTno,¿Se supones que esto sera la pelicula de Slender?👎
ySy8mcceTno,Im the only one who actually liked this movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Should be based on marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,"I could pay $100 for a voice actor to read the original story and it would probably be better. 
That being said, probably not more popular. They're trying to cash in on a creepypasta industry without really paying mind to it, people will see it anyway."
ySy8mcceTno,This is scarier than the creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,I want to.... become.. he's Proxy....
ySy8mcceTno,"dulu ibuku sedang santai menonton tv, tiba2 katanya dari atas jatuh putung rokok yg abis kepakai krna terlihat masih berasap padahal dirumah gk ada yg ngerokok ,lalu dia lari ke ruang tamu tiba tiba berdiri bayangan laki laki tinggi dan kerempeng berwarna hitam .kayaknya itu slenderman versi indonesia deh!"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Que lixo
ySy8mcceTno,hey jeff the killer movie plesae
ySy8mcceTno,Do I have to wait 4 more years?
ySy8mcceTno,"i have little hope for this movie. they seem to be moving from what the character represented in the games and making him into a monster rather than a faceless evil. if they wanted to do it good there would be three main characters, two of them being in the town and one being stuck in the woods. but from what i can see (which isn’t much) that’s not the case. they’re gonna do that thing they do with horror movies with a monster character and give exposition on him way too much. the mystery of the evil is what makes it scary. when it can be understood it can be rationalized, when it’s rationalized it’s not as scary. do the smart thing sony, scrap this version and get a writer that knows what horror is truly about. not jumpscares but tone and mystery."
ySy8mcceTno,"Ever since stranger things came out everything is starting to become like it, Flatliners, Slenderman, and it is sooo much other movies like that."
ySy8mcceTno,whole other characters 99% of screen time slenderman gets 1% of screen time
ySy8mcceTno,"They better not ruin the game,"
ySy8mcceTno,is this based off video game slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Does kate show up?
NO 
Does slender wear a suit?
MOST CERTAINLY NOT
Does it have the flashlight or the pages?
I DON'T THINK SO
Is it a really basic trying to be phsychologic movie?
DON'T KNOW, BUT IT LOOKS BAD"
ySy8mcceTno,Türk yok mu
ySy8mcceTno,cara e cade el que nem vi eu queria ver aquele manequim gostoso
ySy8mcceTno,So is slendy boi gunna be played by an actor or just on cgi thing in people minds
ySy8mcceTno,"sony is trying to cash in again, but this time they're too late on the trend so the cringe is comparable to the last cash in that was moderately trendy."
ySy8mcceTno,This is the next bomb. The next emoji movie. Just you wait.
ySy8mcceTno,"the follow up to the smash hit ""emoji movie"""
ySy8mcceTno,Cuz I am really excited
ySy8mcceTno,Is it original
ySy8mcceTno,I've been dreaming about Slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Beware the teenagers opinions
ySy8mcceTno,YOU MAKE A MOVIE ADAPTED FROM A GAME THAT IS SCARY BECUZ OF THE SUSPENSE AND TURN IT INTO A CLICHED SPOOK FEST? FML
ySy8mcceTno,The sound design on this trailer is REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a really interesting horror movie I’d definitely watch
ySy8mcceTno,I actually laughed at this trailer to be honest.
ySy8mcceTno,Aí supera it a coisa
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony: You know what'll make a FANTASTIC horror movie?!? Using something that's not been popular for 6 years, putting it on the big screen for all the normies, throwing in some random crap that has nothing to do with anything, and giving our main character (Slenderman) a full 2 MINUTES of screen-time!!! IT'S GONNA BE SO CAMPY IT'S AMAZING!!!!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,WHEN IS IT CUMMING OUT!!!??!?DAMI IT
ySy8mcceTno,I love how they attempt to portray this as slender man. Go read some creepypastas then make the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Y cuando chingados sale
ySy8mcceTno,I'm actually really excited to go see this
ySy8mcceTno,Isso é oficial mesmo?
ySy8mcceTno,😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵💀💀💀💀💀🙁🙁😜😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😵👽👽👽👽👾👾👾👾👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
ySy8mcceTno,"sigh😒 
Well at least it can't be worst then the emoji movie





I hope"
ySy8mcceTno,This is years too late
ySy8mcceTno,What was a woman buuuut hey it has slender man in the title so who cares :p
ySy8mcceTno,stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Iam scarry
ySy8mcceTno,Si la cagas te mato
ySy8mcceTno,Is there a message that they want to get across with this movie
ySy8mcceTno,You ruined Slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Fun fact this is base on real life well I think a girl kills 3 or 4 kids for Slenderman. I heard it on the internet.
ySy8mcceTno,And i thought the game was weird
ySy8mcceTno,No Eyes But Watches!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see it
ySy8mcceTno,seriously? slenderman is so old no one even talks about him anymore now you make a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I liked the suicide parts
ySy8mcceTno,"Near the end, my heart was trying to escape from me..."
ySy8mcceTno,Make a Rake movie next! This could be a complete anthology.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m confused I only saw 1 glimpse of slender and I’m sure this won’t even be based of the original Creepypastas halfway through
ySy8mcceTno,"Usually im not too big into suspense horror movies with little action like you get from Indie films, but the video quality and scenery is so beautiful that I cant resist going to see it!"
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf that girl looked like she got raped at the end 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,I think its going to be promising
ySy8mcceTno,doesn't make sensei thought it will be a horror IT but this is suck its so stupidly brutal
ySy8mcceTno,Well looks like the tall white skinny guy made it to our big screens
ySy8mcceTno,looking forward to this
ySy8mcceTno,Going to be trash
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer looks like it was made by school kids.
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone actually write and direct a proper slenderman movie? Like hurry up already.
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like they'll ruin it anyway. Not interested.
ySy8mcceTno,Not very realistic if you ask me..
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man isn’t even in it 😂
It’s like they had a crappy movie that didn’t sell, changed the name and tried to sell it as something else, although it doesn’t look ‘terrible’ as a horror film, for a slender man storyline it’s pretty naff and totally lacking... you know...actual Slender Man"
ySy8mcceTno,they should make a Jeff the killer move
ySy8mcceTno,Yaw ben bu slenderi çok seviyor ya öyle böyle deyil :D görsem sarılacam yaw o kadar seviyorum :D
ySy8mcceTno,"Man this looks bad ...
The game (The Arrival) had a very fascinating ""psychological horror"" side to it, but this just looks like your generic, predictable ""shut up and eat it up"" horror flick."
ySy8mcceTno,Great man!!!
ySy8mcceTno,When out must see
ySy8mcceTno,"LOL ! I didn't noticed the tittle , I thought it was *Spiderman* bit the thumbnail picture looked weird ,I thought again a revolution of spidy - yeah yeah... You don't have to mention I'm a idiot with 43% dumb brain ."
ySy8mcceTno,Eh looks alright...I’ll check it out
ySy8mcceTno,NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
ySy8mcceTno,Considering the true origins behind slenderman this looks like the directors/writers took into account the recent murdercase and some similiar head mess films and mashed them together. To me this will be a failure. But good luck with it....
ySy8mcceTno,emoji movie horror edition
ySy8mcceTno,I really want this to be good cuz slender man is my favorite creepy pasta but honestly this looks like generic horror movie 101
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"Just like the Battleships movie, this shouldn't exist."
ySy8mcceTno,IVideosUSA
ySy8mcceTno,You're 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,bu yanlış süleymander suriyeli kaçırır yani bu filimi süleymandere soracaksınız
ySy8mcceTno,Looks exactly the same as the first time I saw it when it was called *THE RING*
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it will be more hilarious than scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Faltó loquendo
ySy8mcceTno,Definitely rated R.
ySy8mcceTno,This could either be really good or really bad
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys see this, is a game of Slenderman, try it :https://web.roblox.com/games/1447289532/Slenderman-The-Eternal-Darkness"
ySy8mcceTno,Dit is zo eng
ySy8mcceTno,is this movie all black and white if it is it is amazing
ySy8mcceTno,"00:04 #CanYouSeeHim
John Cena Strike Again"
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman rarara  ya quiero ver la película se mira q da miedo me encanta slemderma
ySy8mcceTno,;-;
ySy8mcceTno,the movie will be 98% people running around screaming/sitting around talking and 2% slender man
ySy8mcceTno,well if you didn't know the slenderman Man was based upon a man from Africa who suffered massive malnutrition and genetic disorders hence giving him the so called slender man appearance !
ySy8mcceTno,Screen Gems
ySy8mcceTno,I played slender man the game I wonder how the movie is going to be like if there is a relation whatsoever..🤔
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so glad Slender is getting a movie
ySy8mcceTno,My Trailer Huh I Am Ready For The Movie !!
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting for this since 2012 bring it ON!

I honestly am looking forward to this tho."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to suck. It's gonna have to really surprise me
ySy8mcceTno,Great anime
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when the real thing was on the news?
ySy8mcceTno,Sebe buena
ySy8mcceTno,finaly after fcking about 10 years we had to wait :D OMG YES
ySy8mcceTno,wtff?? where slender man at tho?
ySy8mcceTno,32 mil dislak fans of the killer jeft
ySy8mcceTno,FINAL:JEFF IS IN
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this doesn’t go too far from the threats of the girls
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t know about this. INCludING that the father of the murder thought this movie was horrible
ySy8mcceTno,#iseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"I have been waiting for an  actual good quality slenderman movie for more than 7 years at this  point, and I think this will be good movie as I am always a nerd for anything horror, but as an avid Slender man fan since 2010 and judging from this trailer it won’t be entirely accurate to his story, I am nonetheless VERY EXCITED FOR THIS FILM!"
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Oh nah
ySy8mcceTno,Lame.
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Wait please no don’t do this to me don’t please no god please nooooooooooo why
ySy8mcceTno,SPOILER ALERT: Slender man is actually 2 classmates playing a prank gone wrong.
ySy8mcceTno,I will see this
ySy8mcceTno,This is so differnt from the good slender man it's not like a virus I swear everytime a movie adaptation is made they forget the story and use the name for recognition
ySy8mcceTno,I have watched too many horror movies to the point where it defeats the purpose of a horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,Pura falacia
ySy8mcceTno,so excited to see this FrIzZeN mOvIe!!!!11!1!
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy but gay
ySy8mcceTno,"I NEED one specific thing to happen. When one of the characters dies, they need the screen to go static and slender slightly visible with that sound effect just like in the game slender man (you already know what I'm talking about I really want that in the movie at least once"
ySy8mcceTno,This would’ve worked better as a found footage movie of a guy finding eight pages in the woods.
ySy8mcceTno,"Alright, so we're gonna try again with another Slender Man movie..."
ySy8mcceTno,why not just make a creepypasta movie it would be better
ySy8mcceTno,"when io khe cepa slenderman nu hace khe la gente c suicide
sino loz atherroriza :v"
ySy8mcceTno,"i have written a best film story horror , emotional and Brain power related , i want your help for making a movie , Because i don't have money , I have copyrighted my movie script"
ySy8mcceTno,I genuinely think Sony has something here.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sure this gonna suck; not excited for it 👎👎
ySy8mcceTno,That pretty shary men!
ySy8mcceTno,i can't see him
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, it wants it's movie back"
ySy8mcceTno,"Before dis i alr developed a phobia of slender man, so guess how loud im gonna scream in dis movie"
ySy8mcceTno,If it sucks I'm gonna stab a tree til my knife breaks
ySy8mcceTno,"Me and my friends are gonna just be ""those kids"" going to the theater in Slenderverse cosplay (me as someone from Marble Hornets) and putting up the pages all over the place. . ."
ySy8mcceTno,HOW CAN A MEME BE THIS OP?!
ySy8mcceTno,The sad part is you barley see slender
ySy8mcceTno,Ça a l'air génial 🙌🙌👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,CAN'T WAIT OMFG
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god damnit it’s made by Sony
ySy8mcceTno,how long ago was the slender man craze
ySy8mcceTno,BETTER NOT MAKE IT BAD SONY
ySy8mcceTno,"Esse filme não parece que dará medo.. :/ 
Queria que fossem um grupo de amigos numa floresta, e a noite eles se perdam lá e começam a encontrar papéis com coisas escrito.. 
Que é no caso do jogo mesmo.. Mas também poderia ser um grupo de amigos e apenas um se perca na floresta pra parecer mais com o jogo.."
ySy8mcceTno,omggggggggggggggggggggggggg
ySy8mcceTno,Omg!!
ySy8mcceTno,"i slenderman fan
:D"
ySy8mcceTno,"Really? I was horrified by IT. But this? This didn't even phase me! Maybe because it is 5 years late and expected to be scary, considering the game."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm probably not going to watch it because it seems like just a bunch of people getting taking over by slender Man. I'm 80% positive Slender man himself will probably be shown 3 of less times.
ySy8mcceTno,This is not slender man it’s girls go insane
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!!! ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,What's next Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,I really have no words for this...
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't even see him ones
ySy8mcceTno,Makes no fucking sense
ySy8mcceTno,Trop hâte !!😻
ySy8mcceTno,There are a lot of parts in this trailer that look similar to some of the images in the cursed VHS tape from The Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why would they even think about making a Slender Man movie knowing what those girls did this is ridiculous Sony just wants to make more money off us and doesn’t care how, I know that girl is doing excellent now after her near death experience, but this movie should have never been made and I’m happy that those girls is receiving what they deserve"
ySy8mcceTno,it should be like the game slender the arrival that would be a better story for the movie with the cave part the memories the house and more scary to find out about charlie and the girls bedroom full of paper of the slender man slender messes with your head yes but not like a virus he possess people then kills them with tentacles i liked the game but seeing that the movie doesn't look as good whats the point
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres Brandon Ingram
ySy8mcceTno,What's next after zSlender Man? The Fnaf Movie
ySy8mcceTno,I love my life and sony and ps4 and slendy
ySy8mcceTno,My mom who is 34 got scared shitless by this trailer while I just sat there loving it!!! Can't wait to the movie comes out!!
ySy8mcceTno,#no
ySy8mcceTno,Do happy I'm 10 and I'm not scared of anything and I'm a girl
ySy8mcceTno,Quase infarto cm esse trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,I knew they would make a movie about him
ySy8mcceTno,Looking cheap
ySy8mcceTno,"Ótimo filme pra assistir com a namorada kkkk




Só falta a namorada ;-("
ySy8mcceTno,*I'll never understand why people can't live in a decent area in a decent house instead of dense forest with a whole mansion type house with stairs with soundtracks*
ySy8mcceTno,Cuando saldra
ySy8mcceTno,I’ll give it a chance
ySy8mcceTno,not even scary man..
ySy8mcceTno,Cool!
ySy8mcceTno,Who else just wants the FNaF movie to be out
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man is a paranoia and creeping fear not ""this"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Solo esperemos que no vayan a arruinar a Slendy de ninguna forma, como es ya costumbre de las peliculas."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this rated r?
ySy8mcceTno,5 years later five nights at Freddy’s movie coming out soon
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Wow im excited for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,oloco meu
ySy8mcceTno,Nem kell ennyire igyekezni bassza meg!!

ySy8mcceTno,Si la cagas te mato
ySy8mcceTno,Cringe
ySy8mcceTno,1:52 dat jumpscare tho...
ySy8mcceTno,"*tilts head at the beginning of the trailer*  Is that a needle penetrating a human egg?  *sighs*  Calling it now, this movie is going to end with Slender Man impregnating the girl.  Had high hopes for this movie but I'm not holding my breath now."
ySy8mcceTno,2:15 is probably gonna be the twist
ySy8mcceTno,There should be I little girl with slender man. The girl slender man killed.
ySy8mcceTno,Im deaddd on the spot
ySy8mcceTno,"I think, when it comes to Creepypastas, A Jeff The Killer movie will do exceedingly well, as the Story behind it is Psychological Thriller/Horror than it is Supernatural (which has a  strong possibility of working well).

I won't be surprised if the filmmakers are actually planning to do one after this."
ySy8mcceTno,Been to long for this to come out. Hope it doesent disappoint!
ySy8mcceTno,Vou assistir depois
ySy8mcceTno,It’s ok I guess seen better than this 🌸💖🌸💖
ySy8mcceTno,There won’t be a scary ending
ySy8mcceTno,"Bakura and marik tell the truth, all is true"
ySy8mcceTno,Br?
ySy8mcceTno,What is going on in this trailer?!
ySy8mcceTno,umm wtf is this
ySy8mcceTno,Q opinan del tráiler? 😐
ySy8mcceTno,"Too many idiots people that say this movie is horrible , or blablabla , like seriously , this is just the trailer , and trailer just show some part from the movie not all the part of the movie ."
ySy8mcceTno,people still know about this character in 2018?
ySy8mcceTno,Don't look at it!
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I get the feeling like this is going to be a stupid movie.. Please tell me I’m wrong
ySy8mcceTno,ok so I skipped to 1:23 like littlekuriboh said and I don't hear a gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,Omg yes sony will be rewarded for their actions
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Is this based on true story?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally This is a thing
ySy8mcceTno,It better be a great movie...if you don't want HIM to be angry...
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is barley in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"I have a very long attention span, but I had to fast forward through this trailer because I was so bored."
ySy8mcceTno,It's too late they waited to long for this. back then in like 2012 or 2013 I would have been all for it
ySy8mcceTno,So.... where is Slender Man?
ySy8mcceTno,gay
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is so excited
ySy8mcceTno,"i was thinking about seeing this movie with my friend thinking, oh it cant be that scary, but i guess since its not even about slender it is"
ySy8mcceTno,Did they Just adapted the slender game into the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"""He Gets In Your Head Like A Virus."" 

Umm...No he doesn't xD

idk who these writers are but clearly they don't know how the Slendyman works..."
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,After watching this I feel like someone is going to call me say I'm gonna die in 7 days
ySy8mcceTno,If slenderman came face to face with BlackHecter.......
ySy8mcceTno,"We have all heard about this but what about    "" BlackHecter"""
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for EWW Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Don't ruin Slender.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Slenderman is in it for more than 5 min.
ySy8mcceTno,WHEN GUYS PLZ
ySy8mcceTno,coll fajn grozljivo😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😦😦😦😦😦😦
ySy8mcceTno,omg
ySy8mcceTno,So #Can you see him?? I mean Slenderman in the whole video I can't see Slenderman..
ySy8mcceTno,"Can you see him
John Cena"
ySy8mcceTno,So creepy😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
ySy8mcceTno,2018
ySy8mcceTno,Ojala que sacaran la película de jeff the  killer
ySy8mcceTno,Not enough slender man shown
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good
ySy8mcceTno,Hide n seek?
ySy8mcceTno,I don't really think this is a good trailer
ySy8mcceTno,NO FRIKIN WAYYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,The stranger witch project
ySy8mcceTno,i got scared even from seeing this! I GOTTA WATCH THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,movie looks cool but kills to think how the poor girl 12 year old girl who was almost murdered by her 2 friends must feel about this.
ySy8mcceTno,Why does the Slenderman has this weird t-rex voice?
ySy8mcceTno,I want to be good but I just can't see It happening
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly from what I’ve seen of this trailer this movie looks like it will be good. Originally slenderman wasn’t a creepypasta that chased little kids around it the woods at night, which seems to be what most of you wanted out of the film. He was an entity that screwed with your head (which is what it said in the film) and made you do things that you couldn’t remember doing. If you don’t believe me go watch marble hornets that’s where he originated from."
ySy8mcceTno,Is it like a 15 or something??
ySy8mcceTno,This is fake
ySy8mcceTno,Bet these guys haven't even seen TribeTwelve
ySy8mcceTno,"1:51 , thank me later 😀"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY THIS MOVIE!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks HORRIBLE
ySy8mcceTno,I could probably make a scarier trailer on a $500 budget.
ySy8mcceTno,Tengo que mirarla
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, who thought turning Slender man into a psychological horror was a good idea? A slasher movie would have been better."
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone who brings up the stabbings is gonna get stabbed. Also the trailer made no sense really, too the original story. We didn’t even see the esteemed white face, smooth tentacles and tuxedo"
ySy8mcceTno,NO.
ySy8mcceTno,If two of the skinny trees were actually his legs and they bent and he started running after someone that would have been scary.
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to watch slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Hahaha, real backstory of slender man, he was bullied in elementary school, kids called him skinny boy"
ySy8mcceTno,Dissapointment Man
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like another 0815 horror movie, the elements that make the Slenderman scary, is that he doesn‘t move, that he doesn‘t make sound and that you don‘t know where his victims go. I imagine it‘s very difficult to make a movie about him. I would have liked to see him featured in a completely new kind and style of horror movie, that has much less action and much more tension."
ySy8mcceTno,Ok. this is the most unsettling trailer I've seen in a long while
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,ho yea
ySy8mcceTno,"There is no way, I repeat NO WAY, that this could possibly be good."
ySy8mcceTno,maybe it will turn out to be good... a lot of people judge a movie by the trailer and when the movie comes out it turns out to actually be good. maybe that will be the case with this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,on god best belive imma watch that
ySy8mcceTno,Really can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,make the roblox movie sony
ySy8mcceTno,Psychological horror
ySy8mcceTno,wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally...
ySy8mcceTno,What you're doing down here? *GET BACK UP SOILDER*
ySy8mcceTno,1:35....... goosebumps
ySy8mcceTno,Sony... What happend to you?
ySy8mcceTno,😨
ySy8mcceTno,That’s so scary
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah, the wheres my daughter, cliche."
ySy8mcceTno,When do they play candy crush in Alex's phone?
ySy8mcceTno,Mostrad un poco mas a slenderman :'(
ySy8mcceTno,Wrong
ySy8mcceTno,"Marble Hornets will be scarier than this, I’m sure. 



I’ll still see it out of curiosity, though."
ySy8mcceTno,I love this
ySy8mcceTno,Well it’s about time they made a movie!
ySy8mcceTno,1:26 The Ring much...?
ySy8mcceTno,"Pause at 1:41
Saw him"
ySy8mcceTno,Hehe m
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I think I'd rather watch something scarier... like paint drying.
ySy8mcceTno,#savewomen
ySy8mcceTno,wow at least make a real horror trailer n fking make a best horror filim this shyts slipping as fk common try harder !
ySy8mcceTno,This has to be the worst episode of Marble Hornets so far
ySy8mcceTno,And this is why we burn the forest.
ySy8mcceTno,:D
ySy8mcceTno,bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,I'm actually really excited for this movie. I love slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Hes just like johncena
#Canyouseehim
#Youcantseeme"
ySy8mcceTno,Y que tal luego una de jeff the killer??? :v
ySy8mcceTno,Viendo esto pienso... la pelicula va a ser horrible
ySy8mcceTno,I agree the trailer made no sense but that doesn’t mean the movie itself is gonna be bad. The point of a trailer is to build hype and actually announce that the movie is being made
ySy8mcceTno,it’s a yes from me
ySy8mcceTno,WTF? Slenderman is DEAD. And I thought the Emoji Movie was a bad idea.
ySy8mcceTno,"where is toby, masky, and hoodie?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: is that kid in a hoodie toby? Probs not probably no proxies
EDIT: if that's not Toby why was that kid twitching?"
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG! I love the creepypasta series, and the MAIN character who started this whole thing, HAS HIS OWN MOVIE!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Cum shot at 1:42..........wrong video
ySy8mcceTno,They could’ve done so much more
ySy8mcceTno,YASS IT FINALLY CAME THEY ARE MAKING A MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,N tem história nenhuma!
ySy8mcceTno,"This is a real story but its has changes 
Two girls believe that slender man was real and honoured to kill one of his friend he stabbed the girl 19  times . But the girl survived a cyclist found her. So he took her to hospital. The two girls were is prison,one girl named Morgan was sentenced for 40 years in prison because she was the one who stabbed her and the other TOLD to stab her.the other girl named anissa was sentenced in prison for  25 years.they a girl named Payton . She was about to die in seconds but she survived."
ySy8mcceTno,I bet if this movie does real good then there's likely going to be a Jeff the Killer movie. Who agrees?
ySy8mcceTno,its looks cheese
ySy8mcceTno,"""He gets in your head like a virus."" Reminds me of stranger things."
ySy8mcceTno,"And im sitting here like ""please don't suck, please don't suck"""
ySy8mcceTno,velhooooo que assistir isso no cinema
ySy8mcceTno,Yiğit abi hani öldürmüştü slender man i yiğit abiiii telefonla ara konuş çok korkuyorum yeniden hortlamış yardım ett
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to the comments! Your safe here!😊
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie ain't gonna do well
ySy8mcceTno,Guys i finded that daughter
ySy8mcceTno,"so this,this whole thing is an actual movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,Really?
ySy8mcceTno,This is serious
ySy8mcceTno,"Let's remember that the movie is not really a game movie, remember the game was based on the creepypasta meaning the game had it's own interpretation about the creepypasta. So if you call Slender Man(movie) a game movie you're saying that the movie is a interpretation of the game which the game has the interpretation of the creepypasta. The movie should be based on the creepypasta and should get advice from the original creator of Slender Man. But hey that's none of my business...."
ySy8mcceTno,please dont screw this up...please dont screw this up....please dont screw this up....pleeeeaaaasssseeee dont screw this up
ySy8mcceTno,This is a perfect visual display of garbage. pure and utter garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this? no real horror it just suspension!
ySy8mcceTno,Nosé rick parece falso
ySy8mcceTno,Wait. Is this legit or hoax?
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't really talk about slender man that much
ySy8mcceTno,Who needs sleep anyways....
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok... for me isn't too bad, but i think that this could be better...its look like every movie of horror! there is nothing that u can say ""OMG This is slenderman!"" perfectly this looks like a trailer from whatever movie of ghost... Sony if you want do this be better or the fans will kill you :/"
ySy8mcceTno,"Bem pelo o q parece, fraco demais até agr"
ySy8mcceTno,The game was really fun but mom says I’m too young to watch the movie when I beat the game twenty fucking times!!!!!! I mean sure I’m scared of aliens but slender man is a badass
ySy8mcceTno,WTF 😨
ySy8mcceTno,Slender can make you Tender as well as being a Gender Mender!
ySy8mcceTno,Brandon Ingram's new movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Kkkk, meu deus q trailer maneiro!"
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the masky hoodie toby
ySy8mcceTno,Parece más el aro
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god me and my friends having been planning a sleepover in April and one of them suggested we all watched horror movies everyone disagreed except me the next day she said there would be a slender man movie we could watch soon and now I just search it up and find this oh god oh god oh god I'm gonna nightmares at the sleepover I'm bringing my torch with 10 backup super batteries it's not dying out on me no way
ySy8mcceTno,This is so ... 2009
ySy8mcceTno,I got one question: why not make the movie when slender man was popular
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful.
ySy8mcceTno,Not horrifying but quite cnfusing
ySy8mcceTno,One year ago I seen Slenderman and that's not fake I really really seen him he's looking at me but he's far away from me I seen him at 9 PM in the park I Scared so much
ySy8mcceTno,0:58 when your partner reads through your text messages.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman movie.  Aka.  Emoji movie 2 :spooky Halloween
ySy8mcceTno,@ least Sony got the horror part in it somewhat correct
ySy8mcceTno,Irmağının akışına ölürüm türkiyem ölürüm türkiyem🇹🇷🇹🇷
ySy8mcceTno,Irmağının akışına ölürüm türkiyem ölürüm türkiyem🇹🇷🇹🇷
ySy8mcceTno,1:50 que susto da porra  😱😱😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman is toooo!!!!!!!!!!SCARED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the eight pages though?
ySy8mcceTno,HOW YA DOIN SLENDY
ySy8mcceTno,Welp a new Murderer is gonna be added in Dead By Daylight
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t show this to Morgan 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Hi
ySy8mcceTno,and i see him
ySy8mcceTno,This seems too much like “the ring”
ySy8mcceTno,No lo se Rick parece falso :v???
ySy8mcceTno,The girl writing him give me goosebumps from the noise
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman has become controversial on account of the 2014 stabbings. Making more and more shitty films about him only makes it worse. Now the SCP's, especially 173, 87 (b), and 965, that would be revolutionary in the horror film genre."
ySy8mcceTno,"0:03
I thought this was a Slenderman trailer not a Venom trailer. Why’s Venom coming out of the girl’s eyes and mouth? Lols."
ySy8mcceTno,"i mean we already have marble hornets, a bunch of game, and the creepy pasta. we dont need this. we already have enough and maybe more than enough"
ySy8mcceTno,Im obsessed with this creepy pasta I'm going to watch this😄😄😄
ySy8mcceTno,This full of terribly dated cliches. I hope the movie itself is better.
ySy8mcceTno,Wha wha wha...........
ySy8mcceTno,JEFF TUE KILLER JUST MAKE IT!!!!! not you sony
ySy8mcceTno,"On the lowest of all keys, I want to see this"
ySy8mcceTno,This is the most generic horror film I have ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,It's Sony though. People thought the Amazing Spider-Man movies would be a flop but they ended up doing a fantastic job. I'll give them a chance before I bash them.
ySy8mcceTno,"OK, just WHAT is this??"
ySy8mcceTno,generic
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is over sized man who wants to mix in society
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman. All I can say, Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,This does not look good -_-
ySy8mcceTno,"At least THIS trailer showed the title character in the fucking trailer.
*cough Venom cough*"
ySy8mcceTno,...looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,2011 called: it wants its movie back.
ySy8mcceTno,best film ever
ySy8mcceTno,THIS LOOKS GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,jeff the killer is better than this shitty creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,should've let marvel handle this as well :/
ySy8mcceTno,1:32 Can we just talk about how bad the stab effect and the sound editing was? Like seriously....
ySy8mcceTno,when will people learn that jumpscares =/= good horrormovie?
ySy8mcceTno,10/10  best trailer like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,Pues mas o menos
ySy8mcceTno,Brandom ingram new Movie is cool 😂
ySy8mcceTno,The movie no one ever asked for
ySy8mcceTno,"Ugly or not?...Still watching it!, I've been dreaming of a movie of slenderman since my childhood."
ySy8mcceTno,"Esto ya paso de moda, tardaron mucho en sacar la pelicula. Se quedaron en 2010"
ySy8mcceTno,#stoptheshakingheadhorror
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't some lil girls murder another girl behind this bullshit?
ySy8mcceTno,Monsters inside me: The movie
ySy8mcceTno,i already hate this so much omg
ySy8mcceTno,Uma bosta...dei like☺
ySy8mcceTno,I’m almost dropped my phone when I saw this title I’m not even kidding
ySy8mcceTno,"Movie should be more about Slender Man’s drive to get into the heads of the protagonists and throughout the movie slowly drive them to insanity, hallucinating cause things that appear to be real and leave the audience thinking what’s real and what isn’t. Towards the end, perhaps then they kill off all the main characters, going further to prove that slender is almost an impossible threat to be against"
ySy8mcceTno,What next Pepe the frog the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,B
ySy8mcceTno,10 years too late....
ySy8mcceTno,A little late for this movie sony
ySy8mcceTno,"What if the darker reality and thing we have to fear about this movie is if Slender Man is hardly even in the movie and has no screen time. What if the whole movie is like a crappy version of The Babadook and the plot is just a bunch of kids going crazy and killing each other and themselves, while Slender Man kind just hangs out in the background."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like venom
ySy8mcceTno,"Stupid movie! wow, should have NEVER been made into a movie!!!!! how disgusting!!! after such a terrible tragedy of real life events, whatever happened to creativity? they have to make movies that's ""based on real life TRAGEDIES"", that they can't come up with movie ideas on their own!? I had to look this up after i seen that awful poster at the movie theater I go to hanging on the wall with upcoming movies, when i first saw it hanging there, I literally yelled out loud ""WTF"", because i absolutely could not believe it! LOL people looked at me funny....THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE BOYCOTTED!!! so they can't make a quick buck of this crap movie"
ySy8mcceTno,SPIDER MAN - Official Trailer (HD)
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible. Why would Sony make this crap?
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm all for a Slender Man movie. In fact, a Slender Man movie was supposed to come out in 2013 but never came to be. Judging by the trailers, it looked like everything I wanted in a Slender Man movie. It was called Entity. And no, I am not talking about that found footage movie called the Slender Man, which everybody tends to be confused with. This movie, however, doesn't look like it will be told right. It looks like it will barely even have Slender Man in it. Like I said, I am all for a Slender Man movie and want one more than anything but this upcoming movie looks really bad and kind of insulting."
ySy8mcceTno,noobshit
ySy8mcceTno,Okay that actually didn't look bad. Much more creepy saturated depressing than i expected. Hope they go that route in the film
ySy8mcceTno,Mara jode cham avu thy s
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is cool
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s make a slender man movie and forget what he can actually do
ySy8mcceTno,Yes a good slender man movie a last
ySy8mcceTno,Wow la legenda real alv:v
ySy8mcceTno,"More cliché than 'The Conjuring'

I can already predict the jumpscares..."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like one of those movies to stream instead of theaters
ySy8mcceTno,"im hoping this is a troll, 
but incase this is real im going to say this
if this gets made i want a slendertubbies movie and spongebon slendeypants movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Considering how many actual people, (edit) children, have been killed by deranged teenagers claiming ""Slenderman 'told them to do so'"", this fuckin' movie is REALLY in poor taste."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks better than insidious
ySy8mcceTno,Let's be honest here. A Fnaf movie would fucking destroy this movie if it was announced. Anamatronics are vastly scarier.
ySy8mcceTno,This movies like 6 years too late lol
ySy8mcceTno,I think a couple people lost in a forest with a flashlight and cam recorder would of been a better approach
ySy8mcceTno,Looks typical and storyless. Pass
ySy8mcceTno,"THINK OF THE CHILDREN! WE CANNOT AIR THIS MOVIE! lol

well, maybe don't air it because it's appears to be underwhelming."
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,"Day late, and a buck short."
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait for this movie o saw this on moviebox and wanted to see the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Turns out Creepypasta shouldn't get ruined by getting movie or game adaptions either.
ySy8mcceTno,Huh doesn't look horrible tbh I like that's it's a phycological horror
ySy8mcceTno,This made no sense... Sony probably doesn’t know who Slenderman is
ySy8mcceTno,"I would rather... watch rats eat my balls. metaphorically speaking! I say that because that's how painful it would be watching this... only difference there is a higher possibility that I might enjoy the other than this movie. Not trolling, just stating a honest fact."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks bad already...
ySy8mcceTno,Pewdiepie better be in this!
ySy8mcceTno,lol that nigga could be good at NBA
ySy8mcceTno,"Geez, a Slenderman movie? I guess Hollywood really is out of ideas!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wasn't Slender Man big back in 2012? Aren't you a little late, Sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,We want a movie based off the arrival.
ySy8mcceTno,"Se ve shida, espero que sepan lo que estan haciendo"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'll watch it when it comes to theaters, it's a great looking trailer with a good backstory"
ySy8mcceTno,Why now???  :|
ySy8mcceTno,It's... im...POSSIBLE!!!!!!! A MOVIE SLENDER MAN!? I though he was just a horror game or something but that!?
ySy8mcceTno,🤢
ySy8mcceTno,That girl screwed herself when she gasped
ySy8mcceTno,Who was in the comments?
ySy8mcceTno,make The Rake movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I'll see it cause I'm a fan of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Sony not good at making trailers. Make more movies like The Mummy
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, so much 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,thought i was done with this in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,this  doesnt look good. try again
ySy8mcceTno,01:38 - clearly this girl wasn't going to survive. She looked behind her and also didn't keep moving.
ySy8mcceTno,"It will be better with kids like IT , teens are so boring."
ySy8mcceTno,"WHERE IS HIS PENGUIN SUIT? (Sorry, I couldn't resist)"
ySy8mcceTno,хуйня
ySy8mcceTno,"Ender Man, the first Minecraft movie!"
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf kind of trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Was the worlds scariest game.... wont be the worlds scariest film, that’s for sure."
ySy8mcceTno,2012 is that you ?
ySy8mcceTno,So excited for Horror Movie featuring teens #3428
ySy8mcceTno,Bruxa de Blair + O Chamado? Sério?
ySy8mcceTno,My dreams come true.
ySy8mcceTno,Ridiculous...
ySy8mcceTno,At least it’s better than the it remake
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't even know they were making a slenderman movie and it better be rated R
ySy8mcceTno,"Let's see what is the scariest, game or movie"
ySy8mcceTno,It won’t beat marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm going to predict the future this movie will suck
honestly when was the last time you saw A GOOD horror movie.
There was no story to the game so how did write a script for this.
Please like if you agree."
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I get the feeling this is going to be utter garbage'
ySy8mcceTno,I'm gonna go through this whole because of that classroom homocide scene (wierdo emoji)
ySy8mcceTno,"well, the trailer sucked."
ySy8mcceTno,how soon is soon?
ySy8mcceTno,"The Bye-Bye-Man looked better than this to be honest. But, I may just go to see it, just so I can see if Sony actually does a good for once. If not, then I'll have been glad to have wasted my money."
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this is just a baddly made trailer and the movie is actually good because this doesn't feel like the Slenderman ""Vibe"". this feels like The Ring/The Grudge. And Slenderman actually feels more like David Lynch's mood, like the dark moments in the woods in Twin Peaks..."
ySy8mcceTno,Hottest movie of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,when is it going to come at
ySy8mcceTno,I think you've missed what made this story so scary...
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean I was a fan when I was a kid before I discovered REAL horror games. I do hope this puts the franchise back on the map. I think a Slender game that wasn't as easy, has a decent story, and a few tweaks to everything in general would be fun. Also this game really feeds into my nostalgia"
ySy8mcceTno,Did a meme make a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Khmm... and where's the Slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"well i will say is interesting choice to not feature two really important aspects

the flashlight
and the notes"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,This movie makes no sense. A random girl?? We're talk about how the thing turns into a slender man
ySy8mcceTno,I expected something like the blair witch project ya know. More found footage than... eye-hole horror
ySy8mcceTno,PARECE SER UMA BELA PORCARIA
ySy8mcceTno,cringe.
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see this movie sow bad I WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Ah yes slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,NOW WE NEED JEFF THE KILLER
ySy8mcceTno,"Be me:
-gets high as a rocket
-remembers seeing the Slenderman movie poster after finally watching Star Wars the last Jedi and I'd utterly amazed
-Gets on YouTube
-watches Slenderman movie trailer
-mfw"
ySy8mcceTno,horseshit
ySy8mcceTno,bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood!!! You’re late!!!
ySy8mcceTno,ke
ySy8mcceTno,Wow scary
ySy8mcceTno,"I would rather watching this online.
My wallet and I are happy."
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is great but there is kne bad thing.....too few slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks like the ring's video, lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Y esta mierda?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, please don't skimp on any actual horror aspects just to get a pg 13 rating.  many people are quite worried how this movie is going to turn as well take your time. please i don't want to be disappointed again. don't forget what happened with the Emoji Movie and other films you've done."
ySy8mcceTno,Yup... Another wasted potential... Also late for like 6 years or more :P
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch it!!🤤🤤
ySy8mcceTno,Looks toats scary
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy, a movie about a made-up, overhyped idol which lost relevance in 2014 that 13-year old fan-girls goiter over and always has to be mentioned in every Creepypasta ever. And hey, Sony and Screen Gems is behind this (The same company which gave us the lovely Resident Evil movies and shoddy I, Frankenstein) I can tell this will be *Glorious.*

I can just predict that this will at least get a 15% on Rotten Tomatoes.
..Maybe I'm being to generous, yeah, perhaps a 9%."
ySy8mcceTno,"So much suspence music, showing tail of Slender Man once. Best trailer ever."
ySy8mcceTno,WHERE IS SLENDYS SONG
ySy8mcceTno,Ok I take it back
ySy8mcceTno,SO EXCITED
ySy8mcceTno,What's it rated???
ySy8mcceTno,YAAAAAAS CREEPYPASTAAAA ❤💪
ySy8mcceTno,FINALY A GOOD SLENDER MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,"Un poco tarde... Pero we, siempre se aprecia"
ySy8mcceTno,I bet their not revealing slender man in the trailer because Sony wants to hide his terrifying model
ySy8mcceTno,يلي جاي من طرف ابو عطوان لايك
ySy8mcceTno,"So as a big Slenderman fan, I was always up to date with the stories and any major upcomings of it. It's been a while since I heard Slenderman and just looked after other Horror. I heard of this a while back, but thought nothing of it. today around 1 in the morning the memory hit me and I find this. I have mixed feelings, one being quite surprised. 2018 and Slenderman gets recognized once more, becoming a movie. Why now is my question. Now looking into this the creator of the Slenderman and some of it's mythos will be in it. I had no idea he was an actor as well. I was shocked. Now looking at the trailer I wonder, how will they portray the Slenderman. Will there be the Proxies? It looks interesting. Me being kinda shocked about it is because of all the crazy results coming from the Slenderman stories, mainly the stabbing. Not to mention that a film coming to media from a creepypasta. That's a sight to see. I have my doubts, but it also intrigues me so I'll just have to wait and see. Get ready for the Slenderman craze to boost up once more."
ySy8mcceTno,From video game to movie
ySy8mcceTno,lol
ySy8mcceTno,What.. what is this..? My father.. doesn't do any of this...
ySy8mcceTno,Sonyman wants his $20
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like garbage. Would have been way better if they even remotely tried to stick with the Marble Hornets story
ySy8mcceTno,JESUS CHRIST THIS IS TERRIFYING
ySy8mcceTno,YES YES YES FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, the movie might not be that bad, under strict conditions. The eyeball poking better be plot relevant and there better be multiple slenderman appearances, not just one or two. The sounds in the trailer are needless and pathetic, such as the baby crying, the low pitch roaring and the lack of silence overall... The mental toll on the children from slenderman is almost cheesy. (Slenderman games make you rip out your own eyes when he catches you. I didnt see this in the trailer and I'm very disappointed.)"
ySy8mcceTno,A shitty flash game created years ago is getting a good scary movie? Wow
ySy8mcceTno,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
ySy8mcceTno,look slender man
ySy8mcceTno,A girl almost freaking died because of this!!!!!! THIS NEEDS TO END!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,so late the party... but... OMG THIS IS HYPE EVEN AFTER BEING 4yrs
ySy8mcceTno,"He is real, I'm being haunted because I know everything about him. Ask me anything about Slender, even where he is now, I'll tell you."
ySy8mcceTno,Let's hope Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier don't watch this movie 🤦🏾‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be garbage hahahahaha
ySy8mcceTno,*please tell me this is real*
ySy8mcceTno,Not as scary as my mom in the morning
ySy8mcceTno,"i love horror, and i’m so excited for this!
the only problem is that i think i’m under the age limit 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,I think Slender pregnant her
ySy8mcceTno,PG-13 keeps me away!  Not interested in another teeny bop horror movie! Real horror fans know better!!!
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 GODAMMIT SONY
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, I'm excited for the film because I love the mythos. That doesn't mean I have high hopes for it, it'll be like Insidious: The Last Key. I went in with very low expectations and ended up enjoying the film. Same with Jigsaw and hopefully the same with this. I also love the color pallette they went with. Love the desaturation with it. Idk, I'm a bit of a film geek, game developer, and artist. I have an excuse lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Já quero :oooo

ySy8mcceTno,Is this Stranger Things the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,too boring
ySy8mcceTno,No se unstedes pero siendo sinsero ami me gusto el trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Pathetic.

ySy8mcceTno,At least Javier botet is slender man. He's going to be good.
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSSSSSSS!!!I LOVE SLENDER MAN!
ySy8mcceTno,It looks stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like if the girls were masky, Hoodie, and Ticci Toby the movie would be better and it would make more sense lol"
ySy8mcceTno,😱😵😨
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,This looks just as stupid as the bye bye man.....
ySy8mcceTno,"Jeff the Killer movie!
Then Slender vs Jeff"
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else bored?
ySy8mcceTno,hahahaha slenderman is coming
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't think it was necessary all the gross and disgusting images to freak out people, Slenderman is like psychological horror though."
ySy8mcceTno,Soopy😕🤓
ySy8mcceTno,"For a movie about a myth from the internet. I can say its pretty decent. Not amazing, but decent"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,"God is dead, sony pictures killed him."
ySy8mcceTno,Lol × 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
ySy8mcceTno,Wow......😒
ySy8mcceTno,what's this movie about ?
ySy8mcceTno,She did not know da wae
ySy8mcceTno,O slendermen değil suleyman der bir kere
ySy8mcceTno,Wooooo la tengo que ir a ver 😱😱😱😱😍😍💕❤
ySy8mcceTno,The best movie Gore Verbinski never made
ySy8mcceTno,"Tá uma porcaria esse filme cadê o jogo de achar páginas numa floresta e fugir de uma criatura com enormes tentáculos

Esse filme não tem nada a ver com Sender"
ySy8mcceTno,Shitty wouldn’t recommend watching it
ySy8mcceTno,"#YouCantSeeHim
JOHN CENA"
ySy8mcceTno,Thumbs down on the account of not being scary enough.
ySy8mcceTno,I don't see a God damm suit
ySy8mcceTno,Who's here from Allicattt? So excited to see this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Well time to wait for fnaf
ySy8mcceTno,Yall scared of the movie meanwhile I'm scared of being disgusted by that eye getting that thing stabbed into it.
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 😨😨😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,So stupidly wrong. It existed in real life. But in the movie looks shitting. Slenderman never moves when looking at him and he don't give injuries. All he do is disappear your body without your clothes
ySy8mcceTno,Donde esta slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Imma go see it
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next? 
Do u know de wae 2021?"
ySy8mcceTno,"asi amigos, es como se arruina una buena creppypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,"“People don’t just, disappear.”

Uhh yes they do"
ySy8mcceTno,It's not based on the real Slender man isn't it?
ySy8mcceTno,Sally Williams
ySy8mcceTno,Halli ni sale slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,UGH i dont like this .~. i dont want another movie from a GAME its fake people! :P im the one who thinks the new it was bad.
ySy8mcceTno,funny AS HELL
ySy8mcceTno,I've been reading creepypastas for quite a long time and I'm really happy that they start gaining more recognition but I think creepypastas should stay creepypastas. I'm not really loving the idea of adaptating them into movies. But maybe this movie will be good and prove me wrong.
ySy8mcceTno,I am exited for this because when I was 12 I believed in Slenderman and it makes it more scarier when you live next to the woods
ySy8mcceTno,ok
ySy8mcceTno,WE WANT A JEFF THE KILLER MOVIE!
ySy8mcceTno,1:13
ySy8mcceTno,What is the obsession with this slender man? First those girls who stabbed that poor girl claiming slender man made us do it and now they make a movie on it? Seriously making stuff like this only corrupts the minds of youth. Stupid and pointless. It doesn’t even look scary.
ySy8mcceTno,I don't see Slender man but i see all crazy kid
ySy8mcceTno,"hey people, here's an idea! let's wait until we get another trailer showing slender man in action, or better yet, wait until the movie actually fucking comes out until we judge it. morons."
ySy8mcceTno,dislike bad awful tried to be scary i mean slender man died like 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Really look scary 😯😮
ySy8mcceTno,Whoa!! I can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,this would be baddd
ySy8mcceTno,Psychatrie hospital
ySy8mcceTno,This looks Promising to be Good
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn't really follow his story too much, he supposedly lured children into the forest where he killed him in a horrific manner.
This film sort of morphs in into a demonic creature that controls the thoughts of children... not too much different, but it looks like slender doesn't do any of the killing! the children supposedly self harm... a little disappointing =(

Hopefully it turns out really good though."
ySy8mcceTno,"THIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!






Said everyone in 2012..."
ySy8mcceTno,after the tragedy of those 3 poor children this movie should be banned
ySy8mcceTno,.
ySy8mcceTno,Fiquei com medo
ySy8mcceTno,Plz make laughing jack
ySy8mcceTno,I love you slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,did i miss something or does this have only like 2% of footage that actually has to do with slender man?

ySy8mcceTno,Really not scary
ySy8mcceTno,Should've come out 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Why was there a girl in a lab room that stabbed he self with some kind of knife
ySy8mcceTno,VERY GOOD
ySy8mcceTno,cant even figure out the story line from this.. 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Well this looks like they struggled to find enough interesting things from the movie to create a trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this is good because Sonys making it
ySy8mcceTno,Show de bola!
ySy8mcceTno,I'm hoping they keep it true to the myth and don't just make him a pennywise clone.
ySy8mcceTno,I found out about slender man right after coming home from a camping trip. I really cut it close that would have ruined the trip had I known about it.
ySy8mcceTno,The movie should be about a guy stuck in the woods trying to find the 8 pages
ySy8mcceTno,"o filme provavelmente vai ser ruim, só vou ver pela emoção de ver um game que eu gosto, ir para o cinema (espero que o filme de FNAF não seja tão pastelão assim!)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy, I can't wait for Death Trumpet to get a movie as well"
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like a waste of time...lazy jump scares...missing anything engaging or new.
ySy8mcceTno,Horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Hmhmhmhm !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Si la cagas te mato cabron >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"Bad timing, Sony. In more ways than one."
ySy8mcceTno,Lol @ the girl stabbing herself in the face.
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't think people are find this very entertaining considering two girls ACTUALLY killed someone in the name of this ficticious fan made Horror character. 

(Slenderman was created by a guy competing for a contest mind you)"
ySy8mcceTno,Ya bi gidin lan SÜLEYMANDER hepinize bin basar DŞOZJXXBDNXGHD
ySy8mcceTno,I would really want for this to be based off the lore in the games. With Lauren and Kate both as potential characters.
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm probably the only one who's still interested in Slenderman, but even I think this movie looks like trash. First off, this is years too late. People might probably like it if it was made in 2011/2012. Second, you barely even see Slenderman in the entire trailer. Last, the film was made by Sony, so you know you're in for a load of garbage. And that's only a small fraction of everything else that's bad about this. And I thought the new ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" movie was bad."
ySy8mcceTno,"love that fact that they had printed paper and not note book for the ""drawings"" at 0:43 they should have made it themselves"

ySy8mcceTno,"Hello, YouTubers! I made a minute-long horror short called ""THE WINDMILL MAN"". https://youtu.be/LLnUkhu-kTA If you've got a moment, your viewership would be greatly appreciated! :)"
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this called Slender MAN ans not Slender Woman?! Where is the equality?!
ySy8mcceTno,N O P E
ySy8mcceTno,Why am I slightly disappointed with this trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,No wonder kids are so fd up... crap like this

ySy8mcceTno,Slunder mun x3
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmm...
I think a film related to Slenderman would be great if it was pure psychological, like the Balir Witch Project, in which Slenderman itself would be never seen."
ySy8mcceTno,Le habrán pagado los derechos al creador del creepypasta original? :v
ySy8mcceTno,hahhahahahaha sony is really running out of ideas. OH No its a tall skinny manakin
ySy8mcceTno,What a great way to ruin a good game it used to be a scary game no the movie makes the game boring and no fun
ySy8mcceTno,"So i saw some people point this out in other comments and i want to spread it, Slenderman is wearing his suit.  When they go back to the girl hiding behind the tree after seeing him, you can see him standing right next to the tree now.  Its really difficult to see him and you have to pause at the right moment but you can make out the white under shirt and black tie of Slenderman's suit."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm gonna go see This movie
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone went to 1:23 to listen for gay elephant noises
ySy8mcceTno,Marvel Zombies vs Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,From the people that brought you the emoji movie...

ySy8mcceTno,cool movie
ySy8mcceTno,I can't see slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like an edgy 90s death metal music video
ySy8mcceTno,Up next: Sonic.exe - The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,I would rather spend my time reading the creepypasta myself than watching this
ySy8mcceTno,Make a  Maze runner video game
ySy8mcceTno,Gotta love it when its a slenderman movie and you see him once......
ySy8mcceTno,2:13 You get a better look XD
ySy8mcceTno,Brandon ingram the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Bom...ainda bem q o Slender man ñ ia querer me pegar ( eu acho kkkjjj )

ySy8mcceTno,Meu deeeuuuuss socorroooooooooooooo aí que medooooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone remember the Marble Hornets series? That was the real Slender man ""movie"". It looks like they may have used some elements from it."
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 you can hear Jonathan the gay elephant speaking
ySy8mcceTno,This is what happens when you let people who don't understand memes/creepypasta make movies about memes/creepypasta.
ySy8mcceTno,00:57 rip watchers that tuned up speakers.
ySy8mcceTno,Its OP AF
ySy8mcceTno,I came here cause I misread it as SPIDER MAN :P

ySy8mcceTno,Anybody else started rewatching the Marble Hornets series after seeing a trailer for Slenderman movie finally coming out after all these years? :)
ySy8mcceTno,"Só digo uma coisa
 Ai meu cu"
ySy8mcceTno,Que Viaje E Essa Vei
ySy8mcceTno,"So if slendermans brothers get a movie here’s what I think the rating would be

Sexual Offenderman: NC-17- 
Trenderman: Rated R
Splendorman: Pg 13"
ySy8mcceTno,سليندر مان اخيرا ليه فيلم
ySy8mcceTno,Ok....that looks good
ySy8mcceTno,It only took them like 6 years but it looks good
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,turkler burdamı ?
ySy8mcceTno,"It seems Sony is still trying to prove they can make good movies, hopefully it works this time"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah, I hear it, the gay elephant noise."
ySy8mcceTno,how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
ySy8mcceTno,Luv the trailer but where’s Annalise and Joey king
ySy8mcceTno,They say he watches but meanwhile he has NO eyes! You hear that?!? HE HAS NO EYES!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Ah man I thought this was Going to be a origins movie not about the fucking girl who killed her friend .
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting this long for this movie and... Im disappointed..
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be real bad. They should go and make a Marble Hornets esque movie instead. That'd be fucking dope.
ySy8mcceTno,When will it come out
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time they make a movie for Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Esse filme vai ser muito fodaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh my God, Hollywood cashing in on a free game from ages ago using cliche horror stuff and a monsterous looking slender man? Count me out!"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s amazing :3 it’s MY favourite creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,salakmisiniz siz amk inananlar var begeninde iyi birsey sansin bunlar aq
ySy8mcceTno,I actually want to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman  oyun   all    1000    Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,india ma kab
ySy8mcceTno,I love every part of this😂😂😂

ySy8mcceTno,Que chido
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer was bad sony. Also you're just going to ruin slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony pictures fucked up slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,Should have just been some random person running around in a forest looking for pieces of paper for and hour and a half
ySy8mcceTno,Yay my fellow creepypasta gets all the glory and I get nothing. I'm like the least known creepypasta and ha like what's next. The Smile Dog movie. Better not be. I will pull Slenderman's head of if he doesn't adopt me and add me in
ySy8mcceTno,@Estevão Lopes achei fraco tmb 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabrón y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/fg6w4Tl_OEk Chinese slender man
ySy8mcceTno,BR Não Tem Medo
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like they are really doing the story a disservice by not making this found footage style. If they did this found footage style, they could reveal key plot points as they ""find the tapes."" This movie will probably be in chronological order, and likely won't be hiding much from the viewers, opting more for dramatic irony. When really the audience should be the last to know whats happening. Plus, the way Slenderman's presence affects film adds to the terror"
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim #ivebeenwaitingforthis
ySy8mcceTno,estos esperando .que salga por lo menos un adelanto -_-
ySy8mcceTno,1:38 - 1:52 Is that a UberHaxorNova reference?
ySy8mcceTno,korkunç değil
ySy8mcceTno,IT live's IN the WOODS
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks scary and all, but how does any of this are related to Slenderman. They took Slenderman and trashed it wtf?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhhhhhh SLENDERMAN I LOVE YOU
ySy8mcceTno,Well atleadt make a Ticci Toby movie id like to see tht

ySy8mcceTno,Man I wish I could be a slender man... I'm so fat.
ySy8mcceTno,"droga, pegaram a versão ruim dele"
ySy8mcceTno,0:03 is the creepiest.
ySy8mcceTno,...... I. Can’t. Wait. I know the whole Slender thing was a few years ago but PEOPLE ITS MR SLENDY MAN!! It looks really spooky doe 🤩🤩👌
ySy8mcceTno,"Definitely running out of ideas for movies so they using old stuff from video games to old scary stuff we liked years ago. I have a huge idea fi r a movie and I'm trying write it and I'm not releasing it online at all till I copyright it correctly and it'll be really good something Hollywood hasn't thought of but they would love using and I'm not gonna splli it out or hints till I secure my movie story. I love writing and hope when my story done, that people will love it cause it'll be very unique and original."
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell is this?! I'm not watching that crap when it comes to theaters
ySy8mcceTno,They took to long to make this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Day mode unlocked
ySy8mcceTno,Not gonna work
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else here to listen for the Gay Elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,this trailer looks really lame..
ySy8mcceTno,Is it fine when those big companies take the Cripypastas and just do what they want without know something about it?
ySy8mcceTno,"Pretty late to the party, but better late than never."
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/M1kOcAlVKBI

ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman movie now rly? 2018 in years 90's this movie would be scariest movie ever.
But now hide & seek with guy in slenderman costume at night is much better i think."
ySy8mcceTno,"the ring (2002) called...


it wants its trailer back"
ySy8mcceTno,Suleymander
ySy8mcceTno,Da miedo😫😫😫😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,"A year ago I would have thought this looked terrible, but Channel Zero renewed my faith in creepypasta-inspired TV, so I'm hyped!"
ySy8mcceTno,so scary
ySy8mcceTno,This is like polergist in the forest
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, a little disappointing to say the least"
ySy8mcceTno,peter la anguila se la hubiera rifado como slenderman :v
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY 2018
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting this since 2010 >:3
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow almost eight years after the game, they make a movie about it. Late"
ySy8mcceTno,"https://youtu.be/n-FTRRPMHOQ

👆🏽 Slender the Arrival in real life 😜"
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, slender man is getting his own movie. This should have been done ages ago."
ySy8mcceTno,N vale a pena ver esse filme
ySy8mcceTno,they better not ruin Slenderman for us creepypastas lovers....
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next? An Enderman movie?
ySy8mcceTno,So he can manipulate people to do things and he can put them on a huge drug trip
ySy8mcceTno,This is movie about Slender man and I am pretty sure there's not gonna be much of him at all
ySy8mcceTno,Seems good
ySy8mcceTno,Irrelevant and super late but looks above average. I predict it won't be necessarily good but not completely bad either. Definitely not winning any awards when it comes out. It's just going to be a movie that sort of just exists.
ySy8mcceTno,at 1:00 start the scare!!
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que cumpla con lis expectativas :v
ySy8mcceTno,where are the drums??
ySy8mcceTno,*They should make a movie about Jeff The Killer ;D*
ySy8mcceTno,This like the horror equivalent of the Emoji Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I seriously doubt this will be good. Most horror films are trash especially nowadays. This could have been awesome though.
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next fnaf film in 10 years?
ySy8mcceTno,This sounds awesome gotta admit
ySy8mcceTno,"Can't wait to watch this film 
It's taking so long to come out"
ySy8mcceTno,cok kortum  yalan yalan yalan inamayin  arkadaslar....////
ySy8mcceTno,sony might have a chance to be a good company again
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp, im defininetly not gonna sleep tonight."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a shitty MCR music video .
ySy8mcceTno,Qietal si tambien hacen la secuela y que tambien hagan la de jeff thw killer y otros creepypastas denme like si quieren que hagan esas peliculas
ySy8mcceTno,Queltal si tambien hacen la cecuela y que tambien hagan la de jeff the killer y de ma creepypastas denme like si quieren que hagan esas peliculas
ySy8mcceTno,really creepy but so good
ySy8mcceTno,When does it come out
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time there was a movie of Slendy!
ySy8mcceTno,the emoji movie 2 where the emoji's get revenge on the critics
ySy8mcceTno,"The ""spooky"" b&w gifs were so cheesy oh my god i was a fan of slenderman but this is just bad."
ySy8mcceTno,Dog dt bad
ySy8mcceTno,so where is the 8 paper?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good.
ySy8mcceTno,"They still making stories about Slender man?
























That's old"
ySy8mcceTno,Sounds good
ySy8mcceTno,"From 6 years ago in a photoshooting comp, a photoshopper created the Slender Man. & the picture. 6 years later... A Slender Man Movie.

My opinion: Do you da wae Slender Man or Spit on him!"
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres jeff the killer trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Im 9
Wth"
ySy8mcceTno,Why not release it when slender man was still trendy back in 2013
ySy8mcceTno,"meh, aquele terror pastelão que todo mundo conhece"
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't be rated R. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"#Ansioso nossa mano incrível,2020 Jeff the killer e 2022 vai ser Slenderman vs Jeff the killer ksksks"
ySy8mcceTno,well this looks really boring.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman ölmemişmiydi hatta mezarı Muş'ta
ySy8mcceTno,Finnaly after a few years hell yeah
ySy8mcceTno,It wasn't scary at all.am I right?
ySy8mcceTno,Little benis
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is most likely gonna be garbage. Slender Man does not deserve his own movie. I know this is a bit much but I consider this to be The Emoji Movie of the horror genre.
ySy8mcceTno,"I admit I hate horror movie's but this one, this one is I would like to see"
ySy8mcceTno,хуйня
ySy8mcceTno,I’dont like a trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Yo basic what happened to the classic 19s movies
ySy8mcceTno,He's returned... and he is NOT happy about being forgotten...Not happy about being dismissed as a mere myth... so he's going to teach you all a lesson... by taking your seed...
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know about y'all, but Creepy Pastas becoming movies is honestly retarded in my eyes. They're just horror stories written to enjoy online, not meant to make a quick cash grab. I understand why they'd want to make this, but it seems really late now since Creepy Pastas aren't as popular. He is in a game, but does that really make a difference? Just a game. I don't want to offend anyone, but I just think it's a terrible idea. Another example is that Jeff the Killer movie people want so bad. In fact, I sense it's a worst idea than Slender. His story is already terrible and he's very overrated, and who wants to be seen rooting for a KILLER? For Slender, they can easily ruin him with this movie. He's already a bit overrated, but ok. It's better than Jeff, but taking a random internet meme and trying to make some quick cash seems bad. His trailer is full of predictable moments and is really over the top with too many cliches. Still, this is just my opinion and if you like it, good for you. You see something that I don't! And I wish Sony good luck on this film and that they can achieve their goal."
ySy8mcceTno,The baby laughing was stolen off that weird baby remix...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty bad. Not what i expect from slender. Gonna pass
ySy8mcceTno,all this from a shitty photoshop
ySy8mcceTno,"wat de hel is wong wit yu

ySy8mcceTno,thi is so sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo strang like hell
ySy8mcceTno,2019: five night at Freddy’s
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late
ySy8mcceTno,How the heck did they get permission from he original maker. Who made slender for a drawing contest or whatever it was.
ySy8mcceTno,Ok Sony you better not mess this up!!!
ySy8mcceTno,2019= Ben drowned
ySy8mcceTno,"Trailer: hey look horror imagery
Me: (insert no meme) 
Trailer: look the most beloved online horror character has a movie
Me: (insert Luke saying no)"
ySy8mcceTno,NO NOT SLEENDERMAN HOLLYWOOD HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING FROM US HORROR LOVERS
ySy8mcceTno,Só tem eu de Br aki
ySy8mcceTno,Next: they make a movie about plague inc
ySy8mcceTno,"Shows that the producers really ran out of ideas , and they rely now more on video games what's popular so they can have great revenue, ""claps"" ""claps"" ""claps"" hollywood everybody"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh good. Quick-cuts with high-pitched noise. How fucking original.
ySy8mcceTno,"never thought creepypasta character will became movie







now  i want same thing with jeff the killer please"
ySy8mcceTno,another generic movie :I
ySy8mcceTno,"I have waited so long for a slenderman movie. Was excited until I saw it was from Sony.
Hope it's not as disappointing as the rest of their movies."
ySy8mcceTno,"I like how shitty this seems in comparison to ARG’s on YouTube like Marble Hornets, EverymanHybrid, Tribe Twelve, WhisperedFaith etc."
ySy8mcceTno,an emoji... BUT WITH NO FACE!
ySy8mcceTno,Haha ya se habian tardado en sacar algo sobre el
ySy8mcceTno,nunca mais vou dormir ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,where is the real story? we wait since 2009 to know and they make this...
ySy8mcceTno,ce mamaron :v pense q nunca iba salir :v
ySy8mcceTno,Filme gitcejler
ySy8mcceTno,"isso me lembrou bastante as historias que lia na internet, quando tinha meus 19-20 anos...me cagava de medo na época...lia so pra sofrer msm hehehe. bom trailler , mas nao vou colocar muita espectativa, pra nao estragar a magia...kkk."
ySy8mcceTno,Is it coming out this year cuz I been waiting for someone to make a movie about him for ages because I was told it was completely my out last year but that trailer was just fan made I was disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,So no one noticed the part when slenderman instantly teleported right next the girl after she saw him from a far at 1:43
ySy8mcceTno,First it was picture and then creepy pasta and then a meme and then a game and now an official movie
ySy8mcceTno,Hele şükür filmi yapabildiniz
ySy8mcceTno,"It should be called The Serpent who seeks and destroys, God bless"
ySy8mcceTno,"I was told by 2 fictional Character Toys Voiced over by the Same person on the
   *Little Kuriboh*     YouTube Channel... THAT...
_Jonathan the Gay Elephant_ Has a Voice that can be Heard at 1:23 of this Trailer!!!!
If you missed it the first time; Feel Free to get a Second Listen!! 1:23 <------"
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they follow the story of slender the arrival or something like that.
ySy8mcceTno,This is the first thing I put on when I start my glue huffing session
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer made no fucking sense
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve fea la pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this is gonna be the movie of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Amazing. What started out a a simple ""write a horror story based on an image"" thread on the Something Awful forums has now become a blockbuster movie!"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow it is so scare
ySy8mcceTno,"Nnooooooooooo!
My EMO phase has returned!!"
ySy8mcceTno,What made Marble Hornets so good imo is that it was more psychological horror than just straight up horror. Slenderman wasn’t always on screen delivering spooks he was more the catalyst for fucking up peoples lives.
ySy8mcceTno,1:55 is it just me or does that scream remind anyone of the femur breaker from scp?
ySy8mcceTno,"""people don't just dissappear""
... yes they do, that's why it's call dissappearance"
ySy8mcceTno,looks scary but its made by sony pictures...... WHERE DA EMOJIS AT
ySy8mcceTno,Not wasting my money
ySy8mcceTno,Don't mess this up Sp
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,OH MEU DEEEEEUS EU NAO ACREDITOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,vac slendr
ySy8mcceTno,Tell me when the movie comes out because then ill download it onto my laptop when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,The time has come......release him from his shackles 💀
ySy8mcceTno,"Years too late, and will never be as potent as Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be more trash lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Gerçek hayatata böylece bir şey yok
ySy8mcceTno,Now I want to watch 11 drunk guys play Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,This has potensial.However it goes though I encourage anyone to check out Marble hornets.Just finished watching it yesterday and it’s gold.

1:49 you feel me, and you know me, and you love me, IM OLD GREGG!"
ySy8mcceTno,How about that make a Jeff the killer movie too if ther just gonna make movies about creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,Vai ser muito sucesso
ySy8mcceTno,so....where is slender man? the ring wasn't that good...saw was decent...conjuring was decent...insidious last key was gd....where are all the decent and good movies? HORROR MOVIES <3
ySy8mcceTno,"2020 movies: 
Movement/stalker movie
Never ever/a movie about a ghost girl making people do stuff they never wanted to do
Terrible fate/Ben drown movie
The virus/.exe movie
That's my thoughts for movies"
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder what wouldve happened if they made this 3 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,1:51        Predictable
ySy8mcceTno,finnaly
ySy8mcceTno,still waiting on that SCP movie that was promised years ago

ySy8mcceTno,Kd os brs?
ySy8mcceTno,"2014= The Amazing Spider-Man 2 
2015= Pixels
2016= Ghostbusters reboot
2017= The Emoji Movie
2018= Slender Man the movie

Sony, just stick to making technology. You're better at doing that than making movies."
ySy8mcceTno,Can we have Ticci Toby as comedic relief?
ySy8mcceTno,it still that sound in my head no no no no no
ySy8mcceTno,Concrete Giraffes is better
ySy8mcceTno,ps4 yeeesssss
ySy8mcceTno,"The concept of Slenderman used to keep me up at night. I couldn't look out of windows, I couldn't leave my room to go to the bathroom. Night time was Hell for me back in 2012. I'm glad this movie wasn't made back then."
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not a slender man fan but this looks okay
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDY DADDY.
ySy8mcceTno,Now we just need an SCP: Containment Breach television series
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, it takes a while to get the resources to actually MAKE a movie like this. So it being this late is…to be expected I guess."
ySy8mcceTno,I almost peed laughing so hard when the hand came for her face and it was just some twigs
ySy8mcceTno,Hope the movie is good

ySy8mcceTno,why ghostemane isnt in the soundtrack?
ySy8mcceTno,"dam,I am too light hearted to watch this ... looks so scary"
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly hope this doesn't suck..Been waiting for this

ySy8mcceTno,"Yer dickin’ with me.
Right?"
ySy8mcceTno,la pelicula estara en los cines de chile? porque me dieron unas ganas de ir a verla !!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman peds death scene!
ySy8mcceTno,Boring..
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 The gay elephant noise!
ySy8mcceTno,Is that bender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"Something tells me we’re gonna get a Ticci Toby movie after this, then laughing Jack, and then Jeff the Killer"
ySy8mcceTno,It is a bad thing when your movie still isn't released and people are already making fun of it xD
ySy8mcceTno,2020=Nazi zombies
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you're taking a huge risk with this movie I love creepypasta and slenderman is one of my favorites I'm happy you're making a movie you're probably the only people capable of getting this movie the publicity it needs because you're a major company I just hope you realize the gamble you're taking you could make or break slenderman with this movie so it better be good I don't want to see slenderman die because of a failed movie and when making a movie about something like this there's only one or two ways to do it right to meet audience expectations and fully deliver on a slender man movie true fans will be disappointed if you fail to deliver on the true horror this movie is capable of
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh atleast add a note on a tree... not watching
ySy8mcceTno,"Not that good of a trailer, pretty generic, if you want to encompass fear you need to build up atmosphere, this just had cheap jumpscares and gross out imagery, hope the movie turns out better that this video, I really do enjoy the slender man character."
ySy8mcceTno,lets just hope we don't have any young girls thinking slenderman is real.
ySy8mcceTno,blumhouse would have done a better job
ySy8mcceTno,Quiero la pelicula de Jeff the killer ojala y si sea basada en el creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,I Want To Watch It!
ySy8mcceTno,Looks horrible. If they’re going to make a trailer put more suspense.
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else called matt hiding in the comments
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, the new Slender Man game looks so realistic now."
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be bad judging by that trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,"after ""avengers war of the infinite"" and the ""sequel of Spiderman homecoming"" make a new version of classic Spiderman movies, like the one of Sámano Raimy or the one of Mark web that marked great part of my life"
ySy8mcceTno,"Muy tarde, 15 años tarde"

ySy8mcceTno,bruh
ySy8mcceTno,Sony jodiendo leyendas desde tiempos inmemorables
ySy8mcceTno,"Eh, looks like typical Hollywood cliche thing, still cool to see slender in the big screen"
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like stranger things can you see it
ySy8mcceTno,Please Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,"Sound fades out followed by jumpscares? *check*

Flashing black with loud sound FX? *check*

Trailer ends with a fade-from black and the name of the movie? *check*

Looks like a modern-day horror trailer to me."
ySy8mcceTno,Idc
ySy8mcceTno,Looks so stupid...I can't wait xD
ySy8mcceTno,The book was better smh

ySy8mcceTno,Looks garbage
ySy8mcceTno,What a great 2013 film!
ySy8mcceTno,"Person 1: Ohh! I have an idea! How 'bout we turn an incredibly dead video game into a movie!

Person 2: Awesome!  Great idea! 

Person 3: Great! And what if we also put a link to the trailer for it at the end of the trailer for Jumanji: welcome to the Jungle? I mean, everyone will see and and want to click on it then right?

Person 1: oh yeah! You're a genius for thinking that one up!

Person 2: Ohhhhh, yes! And then the link for the Slenderman trailer can also be to a playlist for all our other movies trailers!"
ySy8mcceTno,Q filme bostaaa 👎😒

ySy8mcceTno,Make Marble Hornets too
ySy8mcceTno,Wow. Slender man... where was you?? I missed you so much ;- ;
ySy8mcceTno,It’s only Brandon Ingram
ySy8mcceTno,To all you people hoping for a creepypasta movie series it ain't happening
ySy8mcceTno,"Next: Ugandan Knuckles Movie.
Not gonna lie, I'd actually watch that."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks crappy but I'm still going to watch and support it becuase Jeff's movie will probably be next and I want that to happen!!!
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,if this is one of those movies where he’s literally shown for like 10mins all together throughout the film i’ll be pissed
ySy8mcceTno,Where the hell is the static! And the tendricals that come out of his back!

ySy8mcceTno,The Gay Elephant sound at 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,I'm fan Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,Most of you don't realize slender man stories date back all the way too 900B.C. And was extremely popular during the 70-80s in the united states So those of you saying 6 years ago it started your facts are pretty off..
ySy8mcceTno,lol so much hate on this
ySy8mcceTno,Wen was the slender hype again? 2007 or 2010?
ySy8mcceTno,Poor girl
ySy8mcceTno,But dey do nat no de wea
ySy8mcceTno,2050=SLENDERMAN 2!

ySy8mcceTno,this movie here [ usgo.us/KgnC ]
ySy8mcceTno,trash
ySy8mcceTno,"They made him this weird cross between Slenderman and the Rake, *frowns* I don’t like the whole mind control nonsense either, i think “Always Watching” will end up having been better then this, but i would love a better movie than either of them. I’m tired of ‘SuperVillain’ Slendy and prefer the basic ‘his presence hunting you/tormenting you ensues terror and fear and you make yourself go crazy’ Slenderman..."
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for this to suck
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh my god there is a movie
Of him. I didn't know that"
ySy8mcceTno,"This has told me nothing about the movie. Just a bunch of ""creepy"" imagery. Bad sign so far... Lots of people do ""just go missing""..."
ySy8mcceTno,5 years later after The Arrival...
ySy8mcceTno,"oh come on

first you make a genderbent ghost busters movie
and now youre making a genderbent stranger things?

ySy8mcceTno,Another slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,honestly not even that scary
ySy8mcceTno,this looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,I can hear ten year old me screaming in the distance
ySy8mcceTno,This seems a bit late. Like 4 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony did this on purpose when everyone forgot about it they brung it back
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time they made a movie for Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,I slender man even in the movie

ySy8mcceTno,NOW THEY MAKE A MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,I'm going to watch it even know there 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Horror Movies... The cheapest and easiest genre of movies to make and the most frequent to be screwed up by over ambitious filmmakers... case in point... Good Luck...
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't get the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,:-o
ySy8mcceTno,"It was only, like, Six years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,OML I need to watch this or I will die in agony.

ySy8mcceTno,fear
ySy8mcceTno,Wgen you watching this at 2 a.m.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man doesnt gross you out with maggots and eyeball poking. He messes with your head when you see him in the corner of your eye then he disappears
ySy8mcceTno,ABOUT TIME!
ySy8mcceTno,Rly? A movie of slenderman? Thaats so.... 2012 was it?
ySy8mcceTno,eu nao ovou dormir por um ano re´prtadojmjp :3 99723+
ySy8mcceTno,"1-Trailer is too long. 2- Actresses not convincing enough 3- Too much CGI. 4-  CGI is not good enough. 5- Looks like ""The ring"" ...""deja vu"".  6- Girl is screaming too much for nothing. Annoying more than scary. 7- Effect of surprise... not surprising enough. 8- The only good thing is the image quality ( grading ) + music somewhat and SFX.   9- Story doesn't make sense nor link to slender man. Conclusion, not gonna be a hit movie.  Honestly, give me a small budget and 2 actors only. I can do a way better trailer for slender man garanteed. Cheers."
ySy8mcceTno,"Few things..
1. Not watching this for a LONG time
2. I swear if he’s wearing a suit I’ll hurt someone and smile at the same time.
3. They better put a reference to the game and maybe when they are investigating the woods they happen to pick up a page."
ySy8mcceTno,This is the best trailer I've ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,(On mom's acc.) OMG I HAVE TO SEE THIS!!!!!!😍😍😆😆😆
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna bring back the creepypasta fandom... this is good.... and this is bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"No eyes

Always watching."
ySy8mcceTno,"stop
no"
ySy8mcceTno,ok I totally was thinking this trailer whou be about a human masked killer....wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,"6 ears ago: ""This would be one hell of a movie!""
Today:😁🔫"
ySy8mcceTno,"might as well rename it too Boogeman because this resembles nothing of the slenderman from creepypastas
honestly they could have just took someone in the creepypasta fandom and they would have made a better trailer better grasping the view of slenderman
this just looks like nothing related to slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony Pictured is dying for money

ySy8mcceTno,"MEH! back in my day Slanderman was 35mb crude made game where you need to collect 10 papers. No matter what you do he gets faster and get you.  So Sony must be something like this
""What old idea are we remastering? How about Slenderman? Yeah   guy who come up with it must be dead or something"""
ySy8mcceTno,We want the roblox/minecraft/club penguin movie!!
ySy8mcceTno,All those stupid people who think that they made this movie from the Slender Man game... Slender Man origins aren't from the game. Slender Man was a myth in 80-90's
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"this is a movie that should be first person.
also why is slender man growling like a beast, that ruins the whole idea of slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,Look its Brandon Ingram staring in Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Que bosta
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a good thriller

ySy8mcceTno,Dislike por que no esta narrada en loquendo :v
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear Hollywood. Just give up,lol. ""Negatively"" surrounds this because some people still have a taste for actual substance and know better than to think this is anything more than complete garbage catered to 12 year olds. It's fucking stupid, not going to be worth anyone's time, and not worth making...and you all know it. bye."
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie will be five nights at Freddy's

ySy8mcceTno,This sounds so guud with Sony headphones lmao
ySy8mcceTno,The game is still scarier
ySy8mcceTno,This gives me nostalgia from back in my creepypasta-obsessed days when I thought Slenderman was genuinely horrifying.
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Slender Man! Its his movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Like si ya te mojaste :v
ySy8mcceTno,I only came here b/c of the Slenderman case about these two girls who try to murder their best friend to please Slenderman I though this was all about that!
ySy8mcceTno,This is a real trailer ?
ySy8mcceTno,Respeten a Dios; Dios es amor !!!
ySy8mcceTno,We've all been waiting for this
ySy8mcceTno,Jaz Sinclair looks so different in this movie she should be in more horror films though Slenderman looks great hope it's Rated R
ySy8mcceTno,This movie's gonna suck. I can see it now
ySy8mcceTno,Why do modern horror movie trailers have that Flash black every few seconds clichè?
ySy8mcceTno,"Can you see him? 

No, but that’s okay with me :)"
ySy8mcceTno,"It has the capability to be a good movie, but it doesnt seem like it from the cover. But its probobly best to not judge a book by its cover"
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to cause another kid to get stabbed😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Cliche: the Main character investigates Slenderman but gets abducted by him and... the police blame her for the disappearance of the children but she/he discover the truth. blah blah blah come back here if that was the plot
ySy8mcceTno,Somebody needs to nuke Hollywood. Enough.
ySy8mcceTno,oh no!!!! not a slender man movie my grandma hates slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Out of all of that, we see no slender smh 🤦🏽‍♂️"

ySy8mcceTno,Actually looks scary
ySy8mcceTno,1:35 she totally spilt some ketchup
ySy8mcceTno,"I just have a few questions. 1 this movie is so late, I literally forgot who he was. 2 Why do cps (creepypastas) like going after kids. I mean L.J feeds of kids. Slenderman does. I don't think IT is a creepy pasta but he goes after kids too. Are baby organs really that good?!?! I'm confused."
ySy8mcceTno,why does this exist?
ySy8mcceTno,"probably not gonna be good, but eh fuckit  ill see it"
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the Candle Jack mo-
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,A slender man movie will be pretty good. But... For God's sake... I don't want a movie based in an actual pitiful creepypasta character like Jeff The Killer or Laughing Jack.
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if they'll show him fully in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Should’ve come out in like 2013
ySy8mcceTno,"NEXT MOVIE....... OUTLAST, LATER......... BACKYARDIGANS 🙄🙄🙄, I GUESS THIS MOVIE WILL BE A DAWN. (SORRY MY ENGLISH DUDES)"

ySy8mcceTno,Yiğit abimiz hani bunu öldürmüştü amk
ySy8mcceTno,STOP MAKING  MOVIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I dunno... Maybe this would scare my innocent mother but...
ySy8mcceTno,"if the meme wasn't dead already, this killed it"
ySy8mcceTno,Did they cast Brandon Ingram to be Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Ummmm, looks weird"
ySy8mcceTno,To be honest an SCP movie would be timeless compared to this. This feels about 8 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,I wait.
ySy8mcceTno,Where tf slender man at though?
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to the world inside your phone.
ySy8mcceTno,They should just make the creepypasta connected universe. That’d be dope
ySy8mcceTno,"Might as well make fallout, uncharted movie or even until dawn. Those would have been better."
ySy8mcceTno,"So, he gets in your head and you die? 

Is this going to be just a bigger budget version of the Bye Bye Man now?"
ySy8mcceTno,People forgot about Samuel the movie Made by Bacon
ySy8mcceTno,Para cuando se estrena??
ySy8mcceTno,Nostalgia to when i was in junior high.
ySy8mcceTno,"I'd like to remind people that the most probable reason for this film not being released a while ago is probably because of the Wisconsin incident, where those two girls had stabbed their friend multiple times and left her to die, luckily, the poor girl survived."
ySy8mcceTno,I learned nothing in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome movie! They picked the wrong cast though...
ySy8mcceTno,"This is cringy asf, I can already tell all the edgy kids are going to try to see this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,There’s something about this that rubs me the wrong way like I feel like it’s totally wrong like the story line isn’t what the original slender man is about
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like a film that will have about 5-10 minutes of Slenderman related scenes and an hour and a half of teenage girls acting weird.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,hope theres at least one proxy
ySy8mcceTno,This is a little too late dont you think?
ySy8mcceTno,Lol...so look not scary
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait!! Omg!!
ySy8mcceTno,Instead of this make the Russian sleep experiment!
ySy8mcceTno,"""si la cagas te mato cabron"""
ySy8mcceTno,Your early sony too early XD
ySy8mcceTno,"If this came out when it was at least 2014 or 2012, we would be so hype to see it. What next Jeff the killer movie in 2019"
ySy8mcceTno,Can this actually work??
ySy8mcceTno,wait what
ySy8mcceTno,Starring Brandon Ingram
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie, if faithful to the game, means everyone loses, even if they win."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so boring lol
ySy8mcceTno,The HBO documentary was better... just saying. 😶
ySy8mcceTno,"Geez if I didn’t know any better, I’d say Gore Verbinski directed this. When I first saw this trailer, I thought for sure I was watching another shitty sequel to “The Ring”....... yeah..no thanks."
ySy8mcceTno,"Their next movie will be Pogs: Gotta Flip Them All, coming out in 2021"
ySy8mcceTno,Dont see how anyone found that generic game to be remotely scary...
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't a little girl die a little bit ago because of this myth?
ySy8mcceTno,The next one will one probably be fnaf
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they make the movie
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer made no sense. But the movie sounds good. :)
ySy8mcceTno,It's a little too late
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks good wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks.......






EPIC!!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,There better be a gay elephant named Jonathon in it.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, why do i got a feeling that there's going to be a Creepypasta cinematic universe Slenderman, Jeff The Killer, The Rake, Smile Dog, Eyeless Jack and luaghing Jack? I mean we have the MCU, DC UNIVERSE and The Monsterverse so why not have a Creepypasta 1?"
ySy8mcceTno,"All the negative comments and I’m like







Yay is gon beh good"
ySy8mcceTno,that sucks i hate it i hate every thing about it
ySy8mcceTno,"people complain about how movies are nothing but super hero movies, then complain about every other movie coming out. Rolls eyes"
ySy8mcceTno,"Guy 1: Crap how are we gonna recover from The Emoji Movie
Guy 2: How about a fidget spinner movie! 
Guy 3: Would you guys shut up and listen to me for once! And please can we finally do my idea 
Guy 1: The one from 5 years ago? I don't know it seems a little bit late... 
Guy 3: *Sigh* it will raise the budget for the *gulp* fidget spinner movie... 
Guy 1 and 2: Count me in!!"
ySy8mcceTno,The nightmare finally comes true
ySy8mcceTno,Little girl.... Awwwww isn't she pretty 😃 you shot Me with Blanks dum Your dead DUm Dum your dead HaaHaAaa
ySy8mcceTno,"oh my, this is aids."
ySy8mcceTno,'-'
ySy8mcceTno,i love how over five years ago this video would have scared us all shitless but now we’re here having a good laugh...
ySy8mcceTno,This movie just looks like another generic cash grab from a franchise that died almost 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell no!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope that the original creators of this horror idea was at least contacted and offered a deal for the rights. Otherwise, let the law wars begin!"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie lowkey looks like it sucks😂🤷🏽‍♀️
ySy8mcceTno,"hollywood is always about 5-10 years behind ANYTHING popular.  i mean, emoji movie..."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this coming out to theaters?
ySy8mcceTno,"COMING THIS SUMMER: The movie you never asked for, made with half the budget it should have had, and from a script with no regard for the source material. Because we know you'll watch it anyway, you sheep."
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called. They want their meme back
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, I disappointed in Sony.. The history, and basically the whole point of slender man is him stalking people.. Yes, I’m gonna be like JoogSquad.. This movie would be so much better if they used:

1. ORIGINAL drawings from the actual slender..
2. The original slender story line as that was how it was originally made..
3. They actually let slender man do what he’s supposed to do..

What I mean by 3 is that slender man doesn’t possess people, he doesn’t make his tentacles come out of someone.. He doesn’t do any of that.. The movie would be 100x better if they did this.."
ySy8mcceTno,"What the heck...slender man was a scary thing 100,000,000,000,000,000 Years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Wait there's a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why did Charlie Charlie movie came first?!
ySy8mcceTno,So this is really true?
ySy8mcceTno,what the hell
ySy8mcceTno,And next we have attack of the slime in 2585
ySy8mcceTno,Yes please
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie “Do yo no the way?” 2030
ySy8mcceTno,is real? the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,And a Jeff the killer movie? That fucking face it's so scary
ySy8mcceTno,"“Guys our movies are getting pretty shitty. What should we do?”
“Remember that internet scaryravioli?”
*nods*"
ySy8mcceTno,Please no
ySy8mcceTno,For those of you who somehow don't know. Slenderman is a tall completely white figure who wears a tux. This shows a dark figure... incorrect my friends!
ySy8mcceTno,I WANT TO DIE
ySy8mcceTno,DIOOOOOOS EL FUCKIN SLENDERFLAN :V
ySy8mcceTno,"1:40 
Why does that look like they just stole it out of  Stranger Things"
ySy8mcceTno,Brasil!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I love how no one has noticed that the writer for this movie is the guy who actually wrote the original Slenderman story. ;p
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly feel bad for the actors who had to be in this film. There gonna get so much hate because there linked with this movie and its gonna be like the little kid who played Anakin in star wars.
ySy8mcceTno,ETA caralho
ySy8mcceTno,this has a little bit of “The Ring” vibe
ySy8mcceTno,Really? Slap together a bunch of creepy images and call it a trailer... Lame
ySy8mcceTno,Who's slender again?
ySy8mcceTno,The first part i thout that were the hole trailer😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Esketit
ySy8mcceTno,Punch u in ur face moafuka I knock ur teeth out
ySy8mcceTno,Did that girl stab her eye or kill herself?
ySy8mcceTno,They should do a marble Hornets movie instead
ySy8mcceTno,"99% of the trailer had girls screaming and creepy pastas 
And not a single jump scare and slender man came at the end"
ySy8mcceTno,"So how about making this movie like a series of characters that encounter slender man? like one is in the forest another investigating a house and another one of something.

But in every one of these small arcs you can see slender man in the background while the character in the movie doesn't but it isn't gonna be like like one of those that are like *OOOO YOU CAN SEE HIM RIGHT BEHIND THE MAIN CHARACTER BUT THEY DONT OOOO* No more like slender man blends into the background like in the remake of halloween when Micheal blends in the background that you need to have a good eye to see him on the first try

Plus they can make it so that this whole thing isn't filled with jump scares and instead its the small sightings that scare you the suspense like ""when will he strike?"" or something I don't know"
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like it'll share a bunch with it follows
ySy8mcceTno,They're a LITTLE too late.
ySy8mcceTno,HARD pass on that
ySy8mcceTno,This looks legit terrible. Just random scenes.
ySy8mcceTno,They probably have to find all notes for an happy end.
ySy8mcceTno,What now Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,well they where 8 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys you shouldn't dislike the video even if it's a bad trailer 
Because dislikes are not good for the channel 
You should be thankful that you get the trailer . 
Just comment your hatred out."
ySy8mcceTno,Unfortunately this looks like it will be a gore filled jumpscare fest instead of focusing on the actually scary things about Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Esse filme vai ser pezado😎👌🏻
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie appeals to no one. Adults don’t care, and the kids at the time when Slenderman was a thing have grown up and don’t care now. I doubt any 10 year old today knows who Slenderman is. You missed you release date by half a decade, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real or just a dream?
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't hate slendy, hes too good to be hated"
ySy8mcceTno,"This should've been done like 6 years ago. You're too late,Sony. Too late. :/"
ySy8mcceTno,slender man can be real....possibly more in a mental state hey !I seen old people that were brilliant just not no more ...they call that dementia were all gonna go thru some old thing ...brain or bladder or slenderman what would you choose? 😎oh Got to go a slender man is at the door
ySy8mcceTno,There's REALLY still people who are scared of the Slender Man ?!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,It took them long enough
ySy8mcceTno,I dont like the trailor
ySy8mcceTno,I'm kinda sick to see the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,god this is not scary at all and slender man was so long ago you should have made this before
ySy8mcceTno,some nba player just went rogue
ySy8mcceTno,honestly a doge movie would be more scary
ySy8mcceTno,"i thought it clicked spiderman, but turn out to be this one -,-"
ySy8mcceTno,*And... Where is Slenderman?*
ySy8mcceTno,Who wait this?
ySy8mcceTno,They gonna ruinslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony: ""We Ruin Everything! Don't Expect Nothing Good from us""

The Dark Tower
Feminist Ghostbusters 
Jack and Jill
Pixels
The NOT so Amazing Spiderman (1 & 2)
The Emoji Movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer could have been edited better.
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait for the MySpace movie in 2020
ySy8mcceTno,Are you serious? We barely even see him in the trailer at all!!! It would have atleast been nice to see him up close and to have the static noise play or maybe even giving him a voice. How kickass would that be? If he had a voice.
ySy8mcceTno,Is it a horror movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Yessssss
ySy8mcceTno,Im surprised when this gets high ratings
ySy8mcceTno,Most views are from little kids
ySy8mcceTno,Yessss
ySy8mcceTno,"I want it to be awesome but I know it will end up getting a 5/10 rating with lame acting and cheap jumpscares, I hope i am wrong, i fucking hope so"
ySy8mcceTno,Вауу...
ySy8mcceTno,The game was better
ySy8mcceTno,wheres the actual slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,brandon ingram
ySy8mcceTno,BOOOOOORRRRRIINNGG
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,It Took so long for a movie of slender
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks for making me scared of being a child :D
ySy8mcceTno,God this looks scary!
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait maybe even the old mark will return to his classics after this as tribute
ySy8mcceTno,Gay movie
ySy8mcceTno,Well...looks like they're finally doing it...was only a matter of time.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks kinda shitty tbh
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see slender man not stupid people
ySy8mcceTno,"Ugh, eye gore"
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer's lame.
ySy8mcceTno,maurag sony yeaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this movie will miss everything that makes slenderman scary.
ySy8mcceTno,so who thought it was a good idea to turn a dead meme creepy pasta into a live action horror film
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late but I'd still watch it.
ySy8mcceTno,For those who are asking where Slender Man is: 1:38-1:54
ySy8mcceTno,"They say he watches, despite having no eyes.
Now there's gonna be a movie about him! Cool.
Good ol' 2012... Simpler times..."
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like they missed the window of time to fully capatilize on Slender Man's popularity
ySy8mcceTno,"who cares if its late , lets just hope its good"
ySy8mcceTno,Lots and Lots of Jets & Planes the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Late, but still, it's awesome that more big guys are recognizing Slenderman that just popped out of Creepypasta years ago. The creator of the original Slenderman story must be so proud."
ySy8mcceTno,This does not seem a bit scary. And the trailer itself told you nothing other than the skills of the director and such.
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly very disappointing trailer to me. Slendy doesn't seem that scary, but unnecessary gore sells it..."
ySy8mcceTno,I watched this before i went to bed and it looks like i will not be sleeping :)
ySy8mcceTno,This is five years too late lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"This is such an unnecessary, generic, late movie that Netflix won’t even let stream after it flops 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks really great . Just because it should've been made 6 years ago doesn't mean the movie shouldn't have been made. I'm very hyped for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,when will they cast john cena as slenderman #canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,i thought slender man career was ended in 2015
ySy8mcceTno,slender who? 😆
ySy8mcceTno,"The director's already painfully mediocre, so there's really no point in having high hopes for this. Shame, this could've been done so well :/"
ySy8mcceTno,looks very dark and psychological... probably gonna be an hour and a half of jump scares
ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap!
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, so your wife just went in the club again, huh?"
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t let this distract you from the fact that you can save 15% or more on car insurance
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there's some good lore in the movie. Anyone think Slendy will get killed?
ySy8mcceTno,Esto no me gusta porque sobrexplotan a un personaje que no merece una peli
ySy8mcceTno,why does this look like an American Horror Story theme intro??
ySy8mcceTno,2020=Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,I just watched for the gay elephant at 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,"seems like a pretty good movie but they kinda ruined slendermans image, slenderman looks and behaves different.
this is just like the deathnote movie that Netflix made, decent but totally fucking up the original story making it shitty"
ySy8mcceTno,"This has got to be one of the most generic, banal things I've seen in a good long while. I think even the Doom movie trailer tried harder."
ySy8mcceTno,"Coulda made a feature film adaptation of the MarbleHornets channel. But no. You decided to write yet another cut-and-paste scawwy moobie. Garbage. Nothing about what appears in this trailer fits any of the Slender Man lore, which is very readily available across the Internet."
ySy8mcceTno,Who here from Lonzo ball ig?😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,this looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,They’re gonna ruin the vision the guys from marble hornets had aren’t they
ySy8mcceTno,This does a horrible job of capturing the erie essence that slenderman was about. He wasnt freddy kruger! Seriously this is so dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my God! Yes it finnaly came out I love Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,WHYYYYYY!!!!!! 1:32
ySy8mcceTno,*BYE BYE MAN*
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, right. He exists..."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg 2012 came so fast!!!! Hope they make a movie about this now and not 6 years later!!!!! Well im off to listen to party rock anthem and give my kik to everyone see yall later!!!😆
ySy8mcceTno,Late. Will be garbage
ySy8mcceTno,God this looks like a mess.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks sick
ySy8mcceTno,when the last time Sony Pictures open the browser?
ySy8mcceTno,"Cool, now make one about the Rake or the Skinwalker. And make it *good* ."
ySy8mcceTno,#YouCanSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,When girls say they like tall guys
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman wow me satifactory
ySy8mcceTno,If there isn’t a Gimme 20 Dollars reference this movie failed
ySy8mcceTno,the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it could turn out when it hit theaters
ySy8mcceTno,the only thing that scared me was the magots
ySy8mcceTno,WOW WHAT AN ORIGINAL CONCEPT
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood has no shame!
ySy8mcceTno,Omg snoy you screwed up with the emoji movie why this?
ySy8mcceTno,"""Give me $20""
This movie is going to be terrible."
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell to the no no no
ySy8mcceTno,Can Sony.... stop
ySy8mcceTno,I'm gonna laugh the whole time.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is YEARS late, but hey, I'm excited"
ySy8mcceTno,How do you make a movie out of a _meme_
ySy8mcceTno,who knows
ySy8mcceTno,this is gonna be a good movie :)
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmm... Ok.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hate to break it to you, Sony, but your a bit late... like... a few years late. Middle schoolers who were obsessed with slenderman should be graduating around this time. What's next? A FNAF film in 2020?"
ySy8mcceTno,If they don’t have the proxies I’m gonna be mad
ySy8mcceTno,"OF COURSE ITS SONY. Geezes, GET FIRED CEO TONY VINCIQUERRA"
ySy8mcceTno,Plot Twist! Its really Kevin Durant
ySy8mcceTno,Welp now im impressed😂
ySy8mcceTno,"0:51, did she just say Micheal Myers?"
ySy8mcceTno,"YESSS I KNEW THEY WOULD MAKE A MOVIE WITH SLENDER MAN! 
The daughter in the woods is Sally"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this an actual movie or is it just one of those fan-made ones that are fake
ySy8mcceTno,It’s gonna be trash don’t @ me
ySy8mcceTno,No lo se rick parece falso
ySy8mcceTno,"They could do some good and make a movie other creepypasta. I mean a movie about Eyeless Jack,BEN Drowned or Jeff the killer should would be entertraining"

ySy8mcceTno,this is the same companny that made the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,did this really have to be made? UPDATE : I would have rather had the fidget spinner movie exist.
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing this has in common withe slender is the forest...
ySy8mcceTno,I'm waiting of an L.Jack one.
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly like how the went with the psychological approach to this instead of it just as a monster on the lose kind of movie
ySy8mcceTno,I'd say this movie is about 3 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so good I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Rock and roll guy at 1:20
ySy8mcceTno,The Room: Kids edition
ySy8mcceTno,wow this was late
ySy8mcceTno,WHY NOW EXACTLY?!
ySy8mcceTno,So. ....COOOOOOOL !!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Spit on him bruddahs
ySy8mcceTno,I hope to see the Jeff the Killer movie next...
ySy8mcceTno,...but why?
ySy8mcceTno,"""He gets in your head like a virus."" An interesting portrayal, but i would argue Slendy is more akin to water. He starts off as a leak in the back of your mind, then as the hole widens he grows and grows until your head is just a roaring flood and you drown of insanity."
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for Fidget Spinners the movie
ySy8mcceTno,No one cares anymore...should've done it when it was hype.
ySy8mcceTno,1:35 JESUS I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT
ySy8mcceTno,"Directed by Silvain White, who ripped off Gore Verbinski's The Ring.  Is nothing safe?"
ySy8mcceTno,No la caguen o los matamos a criticas >:u
ySy8mcceTno,"I dont want to be mean, but this seems too generic, hope the final product wont look like mix of The Ring, Exorcist and others. Ive seen a lot of fun made Slenderman movies that were suprisingly good or this one that has low views but worth watching /watch?v=zx7cCQeLWp4"
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie will be Do you know da wae in 2023
ySy8mcceTno,Hope fully they dont STAB the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is Voldemort resurrected
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was gonna some fan made trailer but jeez this is actually legit **facepalms**
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Finally! It's coming!
ySy8mcceTno,Better late than never?
ySy8mcceTno,When you know there’s a jump scare coming but you scream anyway
ySy8mcceTno,This don’t even look scary
ySy8mcceTno,hmm hopefully video quality will be better in a release
ySy8mcceTno,wow all typical mindfking stuff which isnt even mind fking and then 1 encounter with  him alright already bored
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I have a goosebumps!!! 😨😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,"For those who support bill weier into cancelling the movie, why dont you go to his house and lick him in his boot!"
ySy8mcceTno,Has anyone seen this trailer reaction https://youtu.be/_wSLaD0lw5g
ySy8mcceTno,"OHHHHH GOOD
_OHHHHHHHHH GOOD_
*_OHHHHHHHHHHHH GOOD_*"
ySy8mcceTno,Didnt even have the iconic static screen. Or the white noise effect.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,Guys stop making fun of the movie and sayin' your late. Aprecciate the work they are throwing on the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this is a real movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman: WHERE IS MY FACE?!?!! ( Ha ha get the joke? No? Okay I will just leave)
ySy8mcceTno,God damnit Sony... Wtf is this...( In my opinion the movie should be more like the game mysterious and etc... Plus not going to lied this is the *BIGGEST* cash grab of the year)
ySy8mcceTno,"They got it wrong, Slender man isn't just a guy that stands there and mind fucks you, though that's creepy on its own Slender has another, more animalistic side. His tentacles and facial features, yes facial features only come out when he's angry, and when he's angry his face basically splits in half into a giant mouth and his ""eyes"" become really sunk in holes in his head so he just grows a mouth and his ""skull"" becomes more pronounced. I really hope we have a scene where Slender is pissed with his tentacles out and crawling after one of the characters up a set of stairs or something, that would be the perfect scene to show that side of Slender. Hope this movie wont be trash."
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Brasileiros como eu??
ySy8mcceTno,"much rather an SCP movie, plus its like 6 years old and dead at this point, and its so very generic, but what do you expect, its from the people that graced us with the emoji movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Um.. WOW
ySy8mcceTno,Why would you find 8 pages at night when you can do it when it's daytime when it's bright lol
ySy8mcceTno,Quem produsiu esse filme fumou banana misturado com café
ySy8mcceTno,finaly a slender movie
ySy8mcceTno,So wired......but interesting!
ySy8mcceTno,Its too late.
ySy8mcceTno,i dont see slender as a pedo in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,O CAPETA VOLTO
ySy8mcceTno,wheeze
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't seem to embody the concept of Slenderman very well.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real or fake?
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe is here
ySy8mcceTno,Now is that supposed to be scary or
ySy8mcceTno,I always knew Slender Man was real.
ySy8mcceTno,"Do people really think movies are made overnight? Oh no because when they’re not they’re too late, right? I don’t care if slender man is one year old or 10, 

*HOW OLD IS “IT”?*"
ySy8mcceTno,Cringe
ySy8mcceTno,is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,"They can't be serious about this, right? Right? Anyone? No? Ok..."
ySy8mcceTno,so i consider this a good trailer because it doesnt spoil everything although it seems boring. im guna watch it
ySy8mcceTno,It is not terrible
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,1:33 -throws up-
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like stranger things Season 2
ySy8mcceTno,"Can't wait for the sequel, Trenderman!  Slenderman's gay brother that judges your fashion."
ySy8mcceTno,That's movie fucked up.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna bomb so bad!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I think I found my new favorite scary movie, sorry IT"
ySy8mcceTno,When will this be showing?
ySy8mcceTno,Paska raileri ku ei ees ladii näkyny😠😠😠😠
ySy8mcceTno,The meme is dead and the acting looks cringe...
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not gonna sleep for a week
ySy8mcceTno,This seems scary and amazing. Finally a good horror film! Does anybody know the date that's coming out?
ySy8mcceTno,Lame.
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that people think Marble Hornets did use Slenderman annoys me. They based it OFF him and named it 'The Operator'.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks Like A Good Comedy Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Add the PROXYS Masky Hoodie Ticci Toby
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is the May of 18
ySy8mcceTno,Fuckin normies..
ySy8mcceTno,Movie should have been about 5-6 years ago when we were still interested.
ySy8mcceTno,Seems kinda tasteless after what happened to that poor girl
ySy8mcceTno,why is people judging this movie before it's even out yet. I know its a dead subject but that doesnt mean the movie is gonna be bad
ySy8mcceTno,Why Kate the Chaser is Here????
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is a freaking Nano Virus...
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else not get the plot? Im kinda confused
ySy8mcceTno,*Sad because I am the only one excited for dis because I have waited for one for years ;-;*
ySy8mcceTno,They better make a jeff the killer movie after this.
ySy8mcceTno,Who else wants to see a movie for the Rake?👀
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer looks lazy but who knows it might be an actual good creepypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,Sony ruins all the biggest things that have died out.
ySy8mcceTno,They are bringing out a movie when the game is no longer popular.
ySy8mcceTno,bit late dont you think
ySy8mcceTno,"leave it to sony to make a movie about something that had already had every last ounce of potential squeezed out of it over the course of half a decade. After the fucking emoji movie I didn't think it was possible to fall any deeper into creative bankruptcy than they already had, but here they go, proving everybody wrong yet again. fucking astounding."
ySy8mcceTno,CANT WAIT
ySy8mcceTno,This is fucking cool finally a creepy pasta with their own moview
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,"Okey, after this comes ""Jeff the killer: the movie"". And then you'll make ""Jeff the killer vs Slenderman"", right?"
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve waited so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/KhiNZ4S4-YM
ySy8mcceTno,Laaaaammmmmeeeee
ySy8mcceTno,Your late
ySy8mcceTno,Too late
ySy8mcceTno,This movie might have been acceptable if they announced it half a decade ago.
ySy8mcceTno,someone’s gonna get memed
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda makes me wonder if they do a Cinematic Universe for Creepypasta?
ySy8mcceTno,If this is real imma go watch this.
ySy8mcceTno,WOW😨😨😨😮😮😱😱😱😱😖😖😖
ySy8mcceTno,Oh come on man I just got over my fear of slenderman!
ySy8mcceTno,emoji poop xd
ySy8mcceTno,"I wonder if Patrick Doyle will make any sick beats for this film.....





Yes I'm referring to the emoji movie XD"
ySy8mcceTno,We need a Crepypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,Shoulda came out in like 2013 wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't somehow end it off with humans are the true monsters
ySy8mcceTno,"hey...did u know hits spelled Slenderman and his real name is The Operator...

Just thought u should know 😊"
ySy8mcceTno,So... Emoji Movie anyone? Also where da kidnappings at
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow. From what you know as the made up charectar now the have a MOVIE!!!! Whats next, Freddy Fazbear The Horror Movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This very well may the best horror video game movie to come out since SilentHill.
ySy8mcceTno,"Might be good. Kind of wish they went the 'Chronicle' route with filming though.
Since according to the legend the more he got in your head the more you were compelled to film everything."
ySy8mcceTno,"People say that you actually go crazy once you see Slenderman.

But it’s not like he’s real.."
ySy8mcceTno,"Now all we need is the cast of marble hornets 
Tim, Brian, Jay, hell even Alex.
HELP"
ySy8mcceTno,Mark would like this
ySy8mcceTno,A loop... just to let you know xD 1:15
ySy8mcceTno,jumpscare The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,They don't even show Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,now all i need is to have that freaking fnaf movie come out and my life will be complete (wow sony 7 years late to one of the oldest creepypasta's still looks good though might go and see it)
ySy8mcceTno,"my thoughts 
1. your a little late 
2. doesnt look like it has slender man just kids killing themselves"
ySy8mcceTno,why are people hating on the trailer so much ?
ySy8mcceTno,2018
ySy8mcceTno,i think Sony forgot about the stabbings
ySy8mcceTno,Thought the title was “Sender man”. Was ready for some dude to send it big what a disappointment
ySy8mcceTno,Why.
ySy8mcceTno,lol slenderman trailer bit there is no slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Why are parts of the Internet getting their own movies? But this doesn't look have bad tbh
ySy8mcceTno,If they're going to make movies of old scary things we should have a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,And the creepypasta fans go crazy
ySy8mcceTno,its about 7 years late but who knows it might be better then the Five night at Freddy's movie coming soon.
ySy8mcceTno,Guess they were taking there time in this one...
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t like how they took the gore approach. If it were more of a psychological thriller or horror without that it would be so much better. It is possible to make a good “scary” movie without the use of excessive gore.
ySy8mcceTno,Gimme 20$ lol
ySy8mcceTno,I never knew this would make it to the big screen
ySy8mcceTno,I'M READY
ySy8mcceTno,If it’s just girls he kidnaps does he rape them or kill them or posses them??
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh good, another video game movie. Its a good thing video game movies have a reputation for being good...oh wait. Also, kinda late for this to be coming out isn't it. Its been something like 5 or 6 years since the Slender rage died out"
ySy8mcceTno,ᴏɴᴇ ǫᴜᴇsᴛɪᴏɴ ᴅᴏᴇs sʟᴇɴᴅᴇʀ ᴍᴀɴ ɴᴏ ᴅᴀ ᴡᴀᴇ
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres Thomas Nealy ?
ySy8mcceTno,Black characters can't even survive trailers nowadays.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is about 6 years late, but it still seems cool"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie would have made an insane amount of money back when I was in High School, back when there was hype for Slender Man"
ySy8mcceTno,SONY PLEASE MAKE SLENDERMAN MOVİE GAME FOR PLAYSTATİON 3 AND 4
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh Marble Hornets is better than this
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope they stay cannon to the original story!
ySy8mcceTno,6 years later...
ySy8mcceTno,"It would have likely been more interesting if they based this on the true incident from 2014 when 2 mentally disturbed girls stabbed a classmate many times to impress Slender Man.  Instead, it looks pretty generic."
ySy8mcceTno,slendytubbies...2020
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see this now!!
ySy8mcceTno,"2012: Man slender man movie yes!

2018: Wait now it's happening"
ySy8mcceTno,A Slenderman movie made by sony....bullshit.everybody knows not to let sony make a movie on something good the movie will be bad.
ySy8mcceTno,fatto male!
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim is it just me.....of did the girl from liv and maddie Cali style took her acting to the next level...
ySy8mcceTno,Rated R ?
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, they want their meme back."
ySy8mcceTno,I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME AWESOME
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh God now they're making a movie about this crap? Return of the kids saying ""slenderman made me do it"". Ugh. Looks creepy af though."
ySy8mcceTno,Now I know people are judging this really quick and harsh but it could be a good movie plus if they can make slenderman a movie think about the rest of the possibility of a good horror universe based on creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,"Man, sony is REALLY running out of ideas."
ySy8mcceTno,namrednels
ySy8mcceTno,all i saw was the trailers and stuff the actors weren't there yet
ySy8mcceTno,this was shot in my hometown highschool ayoooo
ySy8mcceTno,I'll just stick to playing the games if you don't mind
ySy8mcceTno,Holy  hell
ySy8mcceTno,For a guy that has no face he seems completely invisible
ySy8mcceTno,"Really? Before slender man was in the top spot for all creepypasta related stuff. And you would think  it was a good idea to make a movie because of its popularity. But nope, this year will be good. That's how you know Sony is losing some originality on its movie."
ySy8mcceTno,психологический фильм!
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone sees me as a tough af person but when it comes to slender man hell  no
ySy8mcceTno,"Meh Ill just stick with Marble Hornets, I have very low standards for this movie would rather have a SCP Movie instead"
ySy8mcceTno,"1. Gets in your head like a virus followed by hallucinations and spookiness
2. Slowly starts psychologically and physically effecting the victim 
3. Symptoms from step 1 are worse 
4. Then makes victim kill her friend  and gets 44 years in jail but she survives"
ySy8mcceTno,Let's hope it's not like jaws and they have the budget to show slender
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years later....
Oh now they make a movie?? 😂😂"
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn’t look anything slender man related and it’s already got a generic scary movie feeling to it. It has some potential but I wish this movie uses that potential to focus more on slenderman and not the victims. It’s his movie after all.
ySy8mcceTno,So... What's the plot?
ySy8mcceTno,I fell asleep watching this.
ySy8mcceTno,Why the hell is this a thing
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony needs to stop with this generic horror movie. You're late, don't come here with movies like this, especially since the movie doesn't seem to be based on slender man. Better you just leave it alone and make a movie worth people's time. I'm not impressed."
ySy8mcceTno,God...I love Creepypasta. I really need to see this movie fast! 😍😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,Where was slendermam
ySy8mcceTno,#icanseehim
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,It looks kinda gross
ySy8mcceTno,"its 2018, slender is dead ffs"
ySy8mcceTno,am i the only one who doesnt get the concept at all? anyways my 10 years old will kill me if i dont watch the movie so yass
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man vs. Pennywise
ySy8mcceTno,Sony por favor espero que valga cada maldito centavo que voy a gastar en e ver esta pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie is gonna recieve bad ratings
ySy8mcceTno,This is gay
ySy8mcceTno,Next up...JEFF THE KILLER
ySy8mcceTno,#Canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly i shitted my pants when i played the game.i was so scared of it.
ySy8mcceTno,I have been reading slender creepypastas since 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Will this get cancelled?
ySy8mcceTno,A tad late don't you think? The slender craze died put years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,"Let me guess, Jeff the Killer is next. Right?"
ySy8mcceTno,"There's actually going to be a Slender Man movie now?  Well, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised."
ySy8mcceTno,Entonces ahora slenderman en un slayer o sigue siendo creepypasta?
ySy8mcceTno,"It was about time...
In my opinion the movie looks good. Everything is greatly showed except for the story but I think that just adds to the charm of mystery. The one thing that frightens me is the blood shot. The blood looks overly dramatically done, just like in Death Note by Netflix. I hope that the movie will be good, but YOLO"
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly one of the worst, most non-sensical trailers I've ever seen."
ySy8mcceTno,Hyi vit**
ySy8mcceTno,If you take me to watch the movie at the theater I will give you...A cup cake!! °w°;;
ySy8mcceTno,Well you know they’ve run out of ideas when they make a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER MAN HAS BEEN A CLASSIC FOR AGES NEXT THING I WANT IS A CREEPY PASTA MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,WHY DID THIS MOVIE TAKE SO LONG
ySy8mcceTno,"Stupidest movie idea ever -__-
Step it up Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"idk, maybe, just maybe... it is too late for that movie ... just saying..."
ySy8mcceTno,Movie of JEFF THE KILLER please
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait for thos
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t know why but this trailer reminds me of the office episode where Gabe makes that weird home video and plays it on Halloween
ySy8mcceTno,this looks soooo goood
ySy8mcceTno,If this was done like 5 years ago then there would be more passengers in the hype train...
ySy8mcceTno,1:33 when u cum on her face lol
ySy8mcceTno,This movie sucks waste of time
ySy8mcceTno,this is not even scary ahhhhh😡
ySy8mcceTno,I want this to be released so badly don’t listen to anyone who disagrees of letting this be released
ySy8mcceTno,A movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Че за дерьмо ебать
ySy8mcceTno,"This is basically ""The Ring"" and ""The Bye Bye Man"" combined, so the mediocre levels are off the scales."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony wth..
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji movie than this lord
ySy8mcceTno,#Respect
ySy8mcceTno,#Respect
ySy8mcceTno,5 years later dear sony
ySy8mcceTno,this looks so bad....
ySy8mcceTno,Well it’s called slender man but we didn’t even get to barely see him
ySy8mcceTno,!
ySy8mcceTno,Aaaaaand creepypasta offically fucking died
ySy8mcceTno,"I doubt this is going to be any good, just a movie riding on the name of slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg there actually making a movie
ySy8mcceTno,it's like real spiderman with half limbs
ySy8mcceTno,can't wait to see this been waitin a long time for this to become a movie!!
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time.
ySy8mcceTno,I thought we all started to pretend slender man didn’t exist after ‘that’ incident
ySy8mcceTno,Dis is spooky
ySy8mcceTno,I'm going to see this
ySy8mcceTno,This gone be another meme in no time 😂👌🏼
ySy8mcceTno,There isn't enough slender man. I barely saw him
ySy8mcceTno,Ok! Anyone have an axe? I have screw drivers! Oh and I need some barbed wire! And a bat!
ySy8mcceTno,I really want Troy or Tim to cameo in this movie they’re the root of all Slender fans in my opinion they made a whole series on it!
ySy8mcceTno,It looks really stupid and cheesy. Thanks Sony. Probably should have spent more money on this one.
ySy8mcceTno,The Crooked Man Trailer; *coming in 2023!*
ySy8mcceTno,IS there gonna be an EnderMan movie too?
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s be honest this isn’t gonna be a scary movie 😴
ySy8mcceTno,Ya cuando el trailer se vuelve aburrido...
ySy8mcceTno,"Last year: emoji movie 
This year: some game u were obsessed with like 6 years ago 


SONYS DOING GREAT"
ySy8mcceTno,I thought he had no suit
ySy8mcceTno,Pora umierać
ySy8mcceTno,That was totally fake!😝
ySy8mcceTno,"""In a small town in Massachusetts..."" Wait... I live in Massachusetts"
ySy8mcceTno,It's either it's not really going to be made into a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,pewdiepie aprrovs
ySy8mcceTno,This honestly doesn’t even look that good
ySy8mcceTno,Took em' long enough!
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know if I like this or not. Feels too overly produced. I would not know this was Slenderman if it was not the title, just looks like a generic horror movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Very late but still im very happy that my all time creepy pasta and game is going to the theaters yeahh...
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should have came out like a few months after Slender the Arrival was released! So 7 freaking years ago?!
ySy8mcceTno,I grew up with Slender fuelled nightmares when the game was popular. I’m watching for nostalgia purposes and to see in what direction they took the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Why do these fucking movies always have to be set in present time? This would work far better in the 50s or 60s... Use your brain for fuck's sake
ySy8mcceTno,.................
ySy8mcceTno,how did slenderman find the girl in the forest usually they are at least half naked screaming there fucking heads off
ySy8mcceTno,Cacete que merda foi essa
ySy8mcceTno,Xbox is better than Playstation
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm sorry, The slenderman will never scare me again... Every time I see him I hear Conan going ""ZE SLENDERMEEEEEEEIN AN OLD WIVES TALEEE"""
ySy8mcceTno,Kto z Polski?
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah nah you lost me
ySy8mcceTno,"This is a movie based on a game where you walk around the forest collecting pages, getting chased. 

Thats not a lot to go off of to make an entire movie"
ySy8mcceTno,1:26 assassin's creed vs slender man...? This movies will be AWESOME!
ySy8mcceTno,Too scary and haunting 😱😱😱😱😱😱.
ySy8mcceTno,It has been years since the Slenderman became a thing. Why would they do it now that it's no longer scary?
ySy8mcceTno,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,A creepy pasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,Can you make a new Jason Voorhees movie??????
ySy8mcceTno,This hardly has anything to do with slenderman ngl
ySy8mcceTno,"*Ugandan knuckles looks at Slender Man* 







""Do you know de way?"""
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Only a bit late for the movie to come out?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought we left this back in 2008
ySy8mcceTno,Really?
ySy8mcceTno,Season 3 of stranger things looks like it's taking a weird direction
ySy8mcceTno,#YesICan
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next? The Emoji Movie? *OH*
ySy8mcceTno,HELL YEAH!!!! FINALLY A SLENDER MOVIE!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,are his proxies gonna be in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood is running out of ideas...
ySy8mcceTno,I remember asking for this movie when the game was still a thing back then LMAO ! 6 years later ..
ySy8mcceTno,Say your prayers little one don’t forget my son to include every one I took you in from within kept you free from sin til the slender man comes ENTER SLENDERMAN
ySy8mcceTno,This is fake
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Who is waiting the trailer of Five Nights at Freddy's?🙌
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like throughout most of the trailer, that they completely missed the point of slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,This is like The Ring + Nightmare on Elm Street
ySy8mcceTno,Nice to see Sony Pictures are continuing the *relevant* movies ideas after the Emoji Movie!!!!!!! What a great way to be one with the fellow hip millennials amirite?
ySy8mcceTno,Directed by the same guy who directed I’ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer? Bound to fail.
ySy8mcceTno,ниачём
ySy8mcceTno,No way
ySy8mcceTno,Когда??!
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't even fucking see him
ySy8mcceTno,0:19 you see police tape or someone baring a body in the right coner
ySy8mcceTno,Oh noooo
ySy8mcceTno,I thought they will released The Nun teaser first
ySy8mcceTno,"just to make sure, slender man never started as a meme or a creepy pasta, it started out as a photo shop contest and apparently the guy who did ""the slender man"" won the contest therefore making slender man famous, later were the 
creepy pasta's and the fan art, and the games. slender man was never really a meme. 
a meme is a form of comedy, slender man was not meant to be a meme. next time for all of you saying he's a meme, he's not.
also i don't like this kind of approach for a slender man movie, they should have gone for something like this.
a couple of college or high school students hear about a legend called ""the slender man"" so they go out in the woods to look for it. over the course of the movie it explains some history of the slender man and what happens to people who confront him. thru out the movie you get to see how each one of the student's gets kidnapped by the slender man.
they should have gone with a documentary approach. not this type of approach.
so it's gonna either be good or fail completely.
i am willing to give this movie a try but it probably will suck. and it might just be people talking all the time and slender man barely appears."
ySy8mcceTno,"whats next, jeff the killer?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello, 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,OoOoOoOhhhhh myyyyyyy BAW GOD!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I remember freshman year of college when someone dressed as Slender Man for Halloween and I thought that was cool. That was seven years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good anyways slenderman looks creepier then arival slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Looks kinda shitty tbh
ySy8mcceTno,This need to be good because it’s so freaking late
ySy8mcceTno,Wow the actual slenderman is shown for about 0.1 secs
ySy8mcceTno,Slender men more like endermen
ySy8mcceTno,This slenderman trailer literally looks like a video I would find on rakaraka. All you need is ronald mcdonald and it's complete XD
ySy8mcceTno,Well Well Well..ive been waiting for this for so long
ySy8mcceTno,This will be huge in Japan. Those weirdos love anything that has tentacles in it.
ySy8mcceTno,what's next? Jeff The Killer? A little late Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Is pewdiepie starring?
ySy8mcceTno,if i were to compose a slenderman movie itd be based around somebodies childhood trauma. then have it come back later on in life until it consumes the person either driving them mad or towards a resolution. either way its an idea that can be played with. yall who see this i wanna know ur idea of a slender movie. comment below. if any idea sounds worthy youll be given credit
ySy8mcceTno,But what does it all  *_mean_*
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder what good movies will come out of this year Sony: remember that game you were ubsessed with when you were 7 me: NO WAY I’m not flipping watching this. 20 years from now me hey son when I was 11 this movie scared the crap out of me and I said that i wouldn’t watch it and i made a entire comment about this conversation on YouTube
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy! I found footprints in my woods...dress shoes in the snow...just sayin' #amarislee
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer would be better with wii sports theme in the background. Like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,"Although it’s only based on slender man and not the exact thing, this movie looks amazing"
ySy8mcceTno,"Let me tell you a story, before Slender Man was very s p o o p y, then later he wasn't and now, look"
ySy8mcceTno,"errmm..  sony, you do realize the whole point of a trailer is to make ppl WANT to go see your movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,At least give it the creepy ambience and sounds from the original game.
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh no... it's so generic... For those that want to see a good series on Slenderman, check out Marble Hornets, their series was amazing and captured the essence of Slenderman PERFECTLY."
ySy8mcceTno,stoopid
ySy8mcceTno,"i've waited 7 years for this

*7 fucking years*"
ySy8mcceTno,looks weak
ySy8mcceTno,Someone make a minecraft parody
ySy8mcceTno,"Not that it’s even possible, but it would be so fucked if this was the film that redeemed video game movies"
ySy8mcceTno,dont find the page!
ySy8mcceTno,"I think this movie is more heavily relying on the news story a couple years ago where those kids, like, killed their friend and said Slender Man made them do it, instead of what he actually was.
This is more news story slender than creepy pasta and game slender. 
Still 800 years late and looks stupid."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow. Looks...unsurprisingly lame. :(
ySy8mcceTno,This was kind of late😓
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm pissed that almost nobody here knows what marble hornets is (and tribetweleve, emh, darkharvest00, ect)
Literally everyone here probably views Slenderman as another mindless creepypasta. Onto the movie, Slenderman doesn't really have a ""cast"" of main characters, or for the most part they live seperate lives, so all these new characters look kinda dissapointing, plus I doubt anything other than found footage would work with slender. But I understand they failed with the MH movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony should make Android 8.0 for Sony Xperia X instead of making a movie that everyone knows that will fail
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully the Film is better than the Trailer....
ySy8mcceTno,I love it when the trailer gives you chills.
ySy8mcceTno,Worst movie of 2018? Because that looked legit bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"If the movie was made when the Slenderman craze was still going on: ""It's a cash grab""

If the movie was made years after it's popularity: ""Too late to do it now folks""

So much negativity lol"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dude about time, when did the game come out?"
ySy8mcceTno,Dammit why Massachusetts...
ySy8mcceTno,Ender man :D
ySy8mcceTno,"(Two seconds in)
NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE 
ALL ABOARD THE NOPE TRAIN!"
ySy8mcceTno,this should've been released in like 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"1:35 "" Did you, like, just stab yourself in front of me? Like, so rude?"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, let's make a movie about a fictional character who was the drive for a real-life attempted murder of a child by 2 teens"
ySy8mcceTno,spender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Hasta que por fin se les da la gana de hacer algo bueno, espero la de jeff"
ySy8mcceTno,"Finalmente, luego de tantos años <3"
ySy8mcceTno,I remember playing the slender an game on ROBLOX and not being able to sleep because I was so scared...
ySy8mcceTno,thank u sony pictures for bringing my childhood to life
ySy8mcceTno,"Hope they stay loyal to the lore.  Mainly that he doesn’t go after you unless you already know of him, and that once he is after you he’ll literally make your life a living nightmare, driving you to the point of insanity. Wonder if we’ll see any cameos and how they might implement the whole eight pages thing. All in all not really that excited but still buying a ticket."
ySy8mcceTno,"*Sees Slendy*
To quote Dan Howell: NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPITY NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey look it’s marks best friend
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman the movie? Are 6 year old creepypasta movies gonna become a thing? Can't wait for the next big ""blockbuster"" where they get Ian from Smosh as Ben Drowned."
ySy8mcceTno,"*sees a movie*
Oh what's it  about?
*saw it was slender man*
OH MYYY"
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or does the wind and bells sound familiar around 1:40-1:48?
ySy8mcceTno,This is like trying to bring back the Harlem shake... prob isn’t gonna end well
ySy8mcceTno,Yaay slender man Movie
ySy8mcceTno,"It's a been a few years since I've read creepypastas especially his, but this doesn't seem to fit"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks fuckan dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Looks generic
ySy8mcceTno,Fnaf was supposed to come out :(
ySy8mcceTno,I hope someone keeps $20 on them!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to see the movie and TV shows
ySy8mcceTno,Pure awesomeness and I disliked it when the curly haired girl stabbed her head
ySy8mcceTno,This dude is creepy. MY brother said if you Believe he's real he is 😯
ySy8mcceTno,"i.....i dont know what to say, idek if i like it or not, i kinda grew up on the slenderman myth and i mean comparing it to this, its completely dfferent...i guess ill give it a try"
ySy8mcceTno,Wondering if Logan Paul will be Slender man in this...
ySy8mcceTno,So basically another remake of IT?
ySy8mcceTno,"looks really good!!

but this is laaaaaate"
ySy8mcceTno,it looks pretty good for being 9 years late
ySy8mcceTno,HAHAHA WHAT?? Why did they wait so long to make this movie! It should have been made when slender man was actually relevant and scary...so they are YEARS late.
ySy8mcceTno,No lo se Rick.. 🤣
ySy8mcceTno,My baby finally got a cool looking movie. I wish it were more based off of Marble Hornets but you can only do so much.
ySy8mcceTno,Bought time
ySy8mcceTno,"My reaction when I saw this in the recommended feed:
y tho"
ySy8mcceTno,Did April Fools come early? Did someone send us all 6 years back without telling anyone? What actually is this??
ySy8mcceTno,Slebemder man goes after little children
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's good...
ySy8mcceTno,He just wants his 20$
ySy8mcceTno,Looks really shitty
ySy8mcceTno,"Probably gonna suck. Probably gonna be good. I dunno. I'll probably see it... Nah, I don't care"
ySy8mcceTno,I did not expect this at all..
ySy8mcceTno,Seems a lot like the tentacaly dude from stranger things but with more infected people this time
ySy8mcceTno,Sony Pictures was a mistake
ySy8mcceTno,It's okay guys you're only six years late
ySy8mcceTno,"you gonna screw this up, telling you"
ySy8mcceTno,They should have made this long ago when he was more popular
ySy8mcceTno,"have you not seen, marble hornets?"
ySy8mcceTno,legit been waiting since 2013
ySy8mcceTno,LittleKuriboh predicted this.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,"The whole point of slender is the eeriness of not knowing when he strikes. He drives people insane, not children though. This seems forced in a way. I have 50/50 hopes. If these are all just dreams then it'll be awesome cause that makes sense. If they're just different stories then is unnecessary"
ySy8mcceTno,"IVE BEEN WANTING A MOVIE OF A CREEPY PASTA FOR A LONG TIME, THANK YOU PEOPLE FOR UNDERSTANDING ME!"
ySy8mcceTno,doesnt look that dope....
ySy8mcceTno,"Should have made it in 2012 when the hype about slender man still was a
ound"
ySy8mcceTno,"AAAAAAAsssooo...¡MAS VALE QUE NO LO ARRUINEN HASTA QUE AL FIN SE LES OCURRE USAR MONSTRUOS DE LOS DE HOY ; AHORA SOLO FALTA DE LOS DE OTRAS CULTURAS!!!...genial, mis súplicas se han oido"
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like they are just a relying on creepy imagery in this trailer, nothing really interests me"
ySy8mcceTno,Its not based on the game its based off the Creepypasta and the real-life incident that happened in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"It doesn't look that good, but I'm hoping that it'll be better than this trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Pochemy papich oret na 1:56?
ySy8mcceTno,IT HAD TO BE SONY! LOL This is gonna suck...
ySy8mcceTno,"This is like that movie, The Ring but on STEROIDS"
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't fucking ruin this, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Coz this isnt 7 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Wait... its Sony Pictures? Well we all know how its going to be
ySy8mcceTno,I WANNA SEE THIS!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Dude this not scarier than it I didn't even flinch
ySy8mcceTno,If he was big off of a video game for 3 years or so I'm pretty sure her could be big for an hour or two. I get that you guys don't see the concept but I would be hyped if there was a movie about a demon like creature slowly making people go publicly Insane. Am I the only one see a girl stab her self in the eye with a scalpel IN SCIENCE CLASS!!!!!! 1:35.
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, the first ""big budget"" slenderman movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"if it was 2012-13 I would be so excited for this movie, but now it's too late. Shows Sony is a bit out of touch."
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry Sony, the Slender man fad ended years ago."
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't look like Slenderman. Looks like horror movie where Slenderman happens to be to monster. But it doesn't look unique to Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,They so late to the slender man trend.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Didnt slendy boi start as a Marble Hornets meme?
ySy8mcceTno,I think they just showed the whole movie...what else is there?
ySy8mcceTno,The Slender Man that couldn't afford Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,"Incredible, how a made up character on a random post 6 or 7 years ago that I gave it a like back then turned into more creepy pastas by other people, then into pc fan based games, then some kids stab with the intent to kill one of their friends because they thought that slenderman was real and was trying to show to another friend through ""sacrificing"" one her friends by killing her ending up on the (inter)national tv and other media, then more videogames but apparently licensed into onlime stores like Steam, now few years later it has a real movie by a known licensed movie company that's been out for so long.
Quite unexpected, not the fact that this creepy pasta meme got a movie, but that the character itself grew too popular"
ySy8mcceTno,Why are they making a movie about this ran out of ideas Sony pictures
ySy8mcceTno,oh god
ySy8mcceTno,I had already forgotten about slender man until I saw this trailer lol
ySy8mcceTno,yum.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,wwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkk
ySy8mcceTno,When coming out
ySy8mcceTno,Yeeeeeeeeessssy es yes yes yes yedsss finally omg I'm soooo fucking excited 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
ySy8mcceTno,it's worthy watching this trailer? because these days i'm so afraid of watching the entire movie just by the trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,When your 3rd grade nightmare comes back smh🤦🏽‍♀️
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is 7 feet tall i am correct ? And his arm span is sooo long i love it
ySy8mcceTno,American horror story?
ySy8mcceTno,Well at least it looks better and than Teen Titans Go! to the Movies.
ySy8mcceTno,needs more Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is going to suck I  just have a feeling about it
ySy8mcceTno,If there's no papers stuck to trees Imma be pissed
ySy8mcceTno,I mean... it looks okay but I'll just rewatch Marble Hornets instead.
ySy8mcceTno,If i was in the Movie i would just go to him and ask: do you know the way
ySy8mcceTno,Concrete giraffes
ySy8mcceTno,Uhh
ySy8mcceTno,"didn't like the trailer, but i still might see the movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man better kill people with tentacles, sharp fingers and he better have his signature tux, don’t disappoint Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"Everyone is saying this movie is 7 years too late, but it's not. The most recent game was only released 2 years ago, so it's not that late, but I know what yous all mean though, the movie probably would've been better if it came out when Slenderman was more popular. 
I'll still go watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,"Qué pedo con tu vida, Sony? ':v"
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this can be the first good video game movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel it's kinda gotten to that point where if it says ""Sony"" on the poster there's no reason to spend money. I mean, I love Spider-Man but Venom? And a video game adaptation of slender man? But Sony also gave us Playstation so that's pretty cool."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man knows de wae
ySy8mcceTno,"I ""love"" how people are being so negative when we only saw a few moments in the trailer. Like for real. I don't think its going to be a blockbuster. Its it is late but I  am trying to be optimistic about it because it COULD BE good. I don't care if it has the highest rating or if it is the scariest movie. I just want to see Slenderman done right and not be completely bored with the movie, which (even bad ones) horror movies USUALLY aren't."
ySy8mcceTno,"1:33 nice way to spoil what could've been a big surprise
that's why I don't watch trailers anymore"
ySy8mcceTno,its about time they made a slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,How to survive slender man: close your eyes and run
ySy8mcceTno,Please let this be the Begining of a creepypasta cinematic universe
ySy8mcceTno,Is this rated
ySy8mcceTno,When the Slender sickness kicks in
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony pictures! The only company that’ll make movie out of cartoon faces on your phone and an out-of-date horror villain. Congratulations, you played yourself"
ySy8mcceTno,Who's still watching this in 2019?
ySy8mcceTno,Hell naw To the naw naw naw.. 🏃🚖✈✈✈
ySy8mcceTno,no mames
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this is good... I don't usually watch horror movies, but the few suspense movies I've seen were good, so hopefully this is suspenseful. Also I hope there isn't too much background music used, just like in the game. I feel like silence is key when it comes to monsters like this."
ySy8mcceTno,"A slenderman movie could be really cool, but you really have to use him sparingly. Slenderman is unique because he is all about stalking you from the shadows, driving you insane with paranoia as you see him in the shadows, and finally killing you."
ySy8mcceTno,Uhh your a little late to the mark there
ySy8mcceTno,OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH LET IT RELEASE
ySy8mcceTno,Lo bueno es que no es de Netflix
ySy8mcceTno,Pa cuando slae
ySy8mcceTno,"I wrote a comic on slender man that was scarier than this back in the day when I used to have nightmares about him, and he came to me in sleep paralysis"
ySy8mcceTno,little late for a slender man movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I stg if somebody goes out looking for 8 pages in the forest

This movie could have potential, but from the trailer, it looks like your typical horror film where teens are under the influence of something supernatural, causing them to harm themselves. There’s more behind Slender Man and what he could do, so I’m hoping they show more of him and what he does."
ySy8mcceTno,"And yet here we are still waiting for a FNAF movie..
This is gonna be interesting cause now that their bringing in slenderman, the creators are gonna have some competition. Which movie will be scarier?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I’ll give it a shot, but if it throws all slender man lore out of the window and doesn’t pay attention to what he’s been built up to be over the years then the 6 year gap from his prime won’t save this film."
ySy8mcceTno,Fingers crossed don't screw this up
ySy8mcceTno,No me la pierdo ni por el carajo
ySy8mcceTno,"This would be SO much better if it was in the 90’s, and newspaper articles, rumors and myths were spread around and caught the attention of some boys who went around in the woods trying to find him."
ySy8mcceTno,"whats next the emoji movie

oh wait"
ySy8mcceTno,Can sm1 explain to me whp/what is slenderman and why everyone is saying the movie is late ?
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late and it doesn't feel like slender man at all it feels like your generic forest related horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Am I the only one who read the comments,Before watching the video. To make sure this wasn't stupid or just Something that doesn't have anything to do with slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm gonna be honest. Slendy is a little ruined for me by now lol
Hopefully this is good though~"
ySy8mcceTno,Dashie gone be the first one in the theater
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope this movie does well. It's about time...
ySy8mcceTno,"First of all this looks horrendous. Second of all , how shitty to continue this after everything that happened. Bunch of noise."
ySy8mcceTno,OMG YAS! QUEEN OF SKINNY LEGENDS!
ySy8mcceTno,1:32 When you fail biology.
ySy8mcceTno,The fucked up the slenderman's formula.....
ySy8mcceTno,How many of y'all came here because you thought this was a Spider Man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Since there is a slender man movie, now, give me the SCP movie"
ySy8mcceTno,NOPE
ySy8mcceTno,2018 looks like a good year for horror movies 🙂 i hope so
ySy8mcceTno,*why make a movie like I thought this whole slenderman thing died in 2015*
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this movie won't be suck.
ySy8mcceTno,Imma not watch it - no thank you
ySy8mcceTno,"This character went viral because a Photoshop competition.
But I think this character is not that scary anymore and  they jump in the bandwagon toooooo late."
ySy8mcceTno,I think slender man just needs a hug really
ySy8mcceTno,the person who wrote this creepy pasta is swimming in money
ySy8mcceTno,*patiently waits for Dan to fall off of his chair*
ySy8mcceTno,"My concern about this movies is the fact that this may be just another lame monster movie, in order for this movie to be scary or drive fear into the audience today is to be creative with the victims of the Slenderman, if these kids are killing themselves for no reason in the movie all because 'oh they saw the slendernan' that is just boring, i want the movie to make the characters and the audience to go though HELL to make their suicides feel real and all the more disturbing, without these elements in a movie about a monster that cause parents grief and kids to go mentally insane, then this movie doesn't have a chance at being a good horror movie."
ySy8mcceTno,They should've probably made this 5 years ago when people still cared about slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Did they even look into the creepypasta itself?

Cos I don't recall slenderman getting into your head."
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to bomb sooo hard.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m going to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony made the Emoji Movie and now they're making Slender Man, Emoji Movie, Slender Man, Emoji Movie, Slender Man, Emoji Movie, Slender Man."
ySy8mcceTno,q que ta acontecendo
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't know Rob Zombie was still directing shitty films.
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM... #imblind xD
ySy8mcceTno,Urgh this looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,This is so insensitive and distasteful. Much too similar to the two girls in wisconsin who stabbed their classmate 16 times because of Slenderman. Way too many similarities. This is just capitalizing on a tragedy and I don't like it.
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look great😐😕😒
ySy8mcceTno,What year is this?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man ""official"" trailer has no Slender Man appearence..."
ySy8mcceTno,Hun the rake would have been better
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell that this movie is gonna suck 😒
ySy8mcceTno,"I
AM
DISAPPOINTED 

This is so unrelated to Slender"
ySy8mcceTno,film name slender name . okay the whole trailer didnt see em once i think its not about slenderman its about the sick people killing themself
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my god that's amazing!
ySy8mcceTno,The real question here is: will she be able to find the 10 pages? I never found the all...
ySy8mcceTno,I already know it's going to be bad since it's made by Sony Pictures
ySy8mcceTno,Not as good as it
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that they made this after the peak of Slender's popularity makes me hopeful for some reason
ySy8mcceTno,I believe it's going to be good
ySy8mcceTno,"Just remember, Sony made Emoji Movie, and gave up on Popeye. Please don't release this Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender's been dead for 5 years and no-one asked for this.
ySy8mcceTno,"8 years late if you ask me,Slenderman was a thing in 2009"
ySy8mcceTno,"Más les vale no llenarla de clichés de películas de terror americanas y aprovecharse del título para vender. >:v. El crepypasta ya tiene creo suficiente material para darle un origen y desarrollo decente. Esto parece una nueva versión de el aro y que slenderman fuera a ser secundario. Deberia volverse algo las de suspenso, no necesariamente tiene que ser un monstruo maldito o eso, en los juegos sólo eres un hombre huyendo en un lugar desconocido. Las notas y todo ese ambiente de estar perdido es lo que debería mostrar la peli. Podrías usar lo de las grabaciones incluso."
ySy8mcceTno,Give him $20
ySy8mcceTno,"1:05 She looks an sounds like Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) from H4, and H5."
ySy8mcceTno,Nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nonono nope nope
ySy8mcceTno,No thank you
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait for this to come out
ySy8mcceTno,Please make the air movie
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty bad tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is more like the woman in the black.... slenderman might not be the best horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm actually pretty excited. The trailer looked pretty good, but i can never have high expectations for movies based off of games."
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah good job Sony you’re making a movie 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait to see this!
ySy8mcceTno,Wow you're only like 6 years late LMAO
ySy8mcceTno,.....Glad I was on the toliet watching this.
ySy8mcceTno,The greatest movie of 2010
ySy8mcceTno,I wish dan and phil were the people seeing slender in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this look like it’s going to suck? It has potential but... *DIDNT EVEN SHOW THE MAN HIMSLEF!!!!*
ySy8mcceTno,Spaghetti boi is back
ySy8mcceTno,Por que la cagan de esta manera
ySy8mcceTno,I hop the FNAF movie is not this gross
ySy8mcceTno,They are about 4 yrs late
ySy8mcceTno,"in Malaysia, he is called as SpenderMan"
ySy8mcceTno,Fuckin gay
ySy8mcceTno,"You toucha his spaghet
So he's coming to get it back.





6 years after you stole it."
ySy8mcceTno,the marble hornets stuff is fine. why dont they just take those videos and turn it into a found footage type movie
ySy8mcceTno,"A lot of people may be confused of how slender man isn't even in this or something.
In this movie slender man gets in your head and makes you do bad things, like how the girl stabbed herself."
ySy8mcceTno,"Should of made it a found footage movie, like the games were originally created to use a camera to see."
ySy8mcceTno,Dem old memes coming back.
ySy8mcceTno,So...IT...but replaced with Slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,a bit too late now
ySy8mcceTno,OMG YASSS THIS IS THE MOMENT WE HAVE ALL ALWAYS WANTED YASSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one exited for this...? Allot of people seem to be hating it...
ySy8mcceTno,Nah m8 just my boy Zer0 from borderlands k bye
ySy8mcceTno,Too scared to zoom in
ySy8mcceTno,So this is going to be a thing now
ySy8mcceTno,This true??
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man scary game at the before years ago and about slender man the cool horror movie is now 2018 really that much sweet and cool! , So now of the year now it's really going to be real exciting!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Here I’ll save you a movie ticket or a trip to the interwebs, search up “marble hornets” they made an interesting series on slenderman, similar to a documentary but its basically a movie cut up into episodes on youtube, heck if the movie is in any form similar i might watch it but this trailer doesn’t grab my attention"
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf did i just watch
ySy8mcceTno,Cant beleive this is coming
ySy8mcceTno,Spooky
ySy8mcceTno,Creppypasta>>Movie 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie will be club penguin in 2020
ySy8mcceTno,When people run out of ideas ( hey let's steal slenderman)
ySy8mcceTno,"In all honesty, it would have been better and far more scary to make a evil within movie. This just looks cheesy, plus everyone knows game movies usually end up sucking."
ySy8mcceTno,esta mrd no esta en loquendo xdxdxdxdxd no la wa a ver po eso jajajajajajajajrea
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,Ugh...you couldn’t of made this movie like 8 years ago? Most likely not going to watch this because I’ve grown out of creepy pasta shiz
ySy8mcceTno,They are seriously making an entire motion picture about this game?! Weird
ySy8mcceTno,:(
ySy8mcceTno,Now that im thinking of it we never actually saw what slender did to you when you looked at him. Still remains a mystery at some point.
ySy8mcceTno,Chopped. If it's not like the actual creepy pasta and urban myth stories it ain't worth watching
ySy8mcceTno,people are gonna make so many lore videos now
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else remembered Missing 411 Cases?
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late sony
ySy8mcceTno,"I imagine this movie would go like this SPOOKY DUDE IN THE WOODS
And then everyone has 18 trillion questions"
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna SEE THIS!!!
ySy8mcceTno,La wea maaaaalaaaaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,I think you’re a little late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,*cough cough 8 years late cough cough*
ySy8mcceTno,Nisiquiera lo muestran solo unas vez deberian mostrarlo mas
ySy8mcceTno,"Make him just a little bit taller. Add the clues. Static sound. Less people.
Idk"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope that this is PG and not 18+
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER MAN. A movie about Conan O Brien lost in the wood....
ySy8mcceTno,This is almost a decade late.
ySy8mcceTno,Again?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a real movie coming out?
ySy8mcceTno,"See, this is why you offer yourself as a proxy instead of a victim. Less bugs."
ySy8mcceTno,OH YeAh BoI
ySy8mcceTno,#DONTLOOKBACKANDSEARCHFORTHOSEQUINKYNOTES
ySy8mcceTno,it's no wonder people murder like they do. Killers are worshiped and remembered.xD human logic
ySy8mcceTno,"now tis a movie
from a game"
ySy8mcceTno,omg does any body know when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,If bye bye man succeeds I don't see how this can fail. Unless if it's budget is 50 million which I doubt.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally. The movie of a legend
ySy8mcceTno,what a fake photo can do
ySy8mcceTno,O yeah man *dancing* my favorite creppypasta gonna be a movie
ySy8mcceTno,I swear I have seen the being of the trailer 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMAN OGMMOGMOGOMOMGMOGMOGOMGGMO FINALLY.. HOW MUCH WE HAVE BEEN WAITING THIS GUYS?!
ySy8mcceTno,Sooo they made a movie out of a mobile game? It's the emoji movie with spooks
ySy8mcceTno,"So slender man was at his popularity peak when again, 2012?"
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting for this to happen so long (NOT ITS SHITTY AF)
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,Probably would have been a bigger hit if it came out back in like 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if they're going to do anything with collecting papers-
ySy8mcceTno,In 4 years we're gonna have a Smile Dog movie or what?
ySy8mcceTno,This is just disappointing
ySy8mcceTno,"I can already tell that is will be another generic horror movie. Nothing relates the Slender man in this trailer, and it's made by Sony, who already fucked up their animations studio with the Emoji Movie. If this flops, I wouldn't be surprised."
ySy8mcceTno,looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Terrible it's gonna suck bad acting with the ladies in it (Not Sexist just with a lot of women in a horror movie have bad acting) unless they add Ticci Toby (for a kick of action  it may be better but my thoughts on it now? Yeah it's gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is gonna suck more than a $2 hooker
ySy8mcceTno,Next time: clash of clans the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Thats a nice intro
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t be the only person who clicked on this hoping for a remake of marble hornets right?
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay... here we go.
First of all, you guys chose a game that is HALF A DECADE OLD to base your movie off of. Why? There are millions of new creepypastas you can use, so why did you choose a super outdated one? Also, this is basically a video game movie, because the creepypasta started with the game, and video game movies are famous for getting terrible ratings. If im honest, the best thing to do is to cancel this whole project, and make something completely new."
ySy8mcceTno,Why just WHY
ySy8mcceTno,Sis gonna be a miss
ySy8mcceTno,Biz TÜRK ĞZ KARDAS
ySy8mcceTno,"Good thing this is not scary cause imma be watching this stuff .
If it’s not a ghost it ain’t scary 😀"
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is about 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,meu deus a merda ta aqui
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man is a very old story, probably around the 1900s 0-0 and when they finally make a movie.... It’s not related. Such a disappointment :("
ySy8mcceTno,Like para la version española con el wilirex :v
ySy8mcceTno,Bien bergas el trailer :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Que trailer más kk, lleno de cliches y momentos de ""sustos"" que son solo screemers, espero que sólo hayan hecho el tráiler mal y no toda la película."
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this was gonna come out some day but I mean you barely saw slender man is he just gonna be a shadow or something
ySy8mcceTno,Remember THIS IS NOT A VIDEOGAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"""They should do a remake where slenderman is a whaman!1!1"" - Feminists about a year from now."
ySy8mcceTno,"Generic spoopy movie

classic"
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala kabron y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm familiar with the game, but. . .what is the story here? 🤔"
ySy8mcceTno,"Not impressed, looks more like lights out than slender man..."
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood is seriously running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"If they really wanted this to be a horror movie based on slender,Just make it with one single charector being terrorized in the forest"
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh this trailer needs Jesus
ySy8mcceTno,Why does it look like they're going to mess it up big time ...
ySy8mcceTno,Spooky man coming to theaters near you
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man my friend I missed youuu so much
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay guys, the trailer may look like trash since there’s not enough slender man but at least watch the movie or check the ratings when the movie DOES come out? Just because a trailer looks bad doesn’t mean a movie will also look bad"
ySy8mcceTno,well i guess there's gonna be some more stabbings thanks a lot Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"Hasta que porfin la sacaron la puta pelicula, aunque no entiendo lo de los ojos"
ySy8mcceTno,"Either the trailer sux, or the movie sux."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good I’ll probably watch
ySy8mcceTno,"I liked it... but I don’t see slender man as the type of person who would jump scare you he’s more subtle, he would just take the kids.. but that wouldn’t make a good movie now would it"
ySy8mcceTno,Just a few years late guys
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you late af
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late guys...

ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,WTF is this?
ySy8mcceTno,I'm really hoping this doesn't suck
ySy8mcceTno,hollywood did it again. taking something that are already popular and completely ruin it.
ySy8mcceTno,So.....Is pewdiepie gonna be in the background of this movie yelling
ySy8mcceTno,Congrats Sony! You're only seven years late!
ySy8mcceTno,eeeeeeeeeee
ySy8mcceTno,"Oie la wea penca, el conchatumare solo apareció 11 segundos de los 2 minutos que duraba esta mierda :v"
ySy8mcceTno,I really don’t want this to suck but it will hah 😞
ySy8mcceTno,Alv;V
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like THE RING for a bit
ySy8mcceTno,It Follows is a way better Slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Mep
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like the best slender movie so far
ySy8mcceTno,"i used to love creepypasta a few years ago, and its nice to see recognition of it now. but it couldve been better a few years ago when creepypasta still had a booming popularity. seeing it now is just a little odd for me, idk about others though. not sure how the movie will turn out though."
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t even know if this is going to be good but I GOT HELLA EXCITED when I saw this but I’m kinda confused most of this doesn’t have anything to do with Slender Man, haha I was scared of Slender Man when I was younger I couldn’t sleep I would think he’s watching me"
ySy8mcceTno,Even our creepypastas aren't safe. Corporate America always finds a way to monetize.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to flop
ySy8mcceTno,"They should have made a big budget horror film about The Rake instead. This looks like it’s gonna be real shitty, relying on suspense rather than scares, but I felt none in the trailer.

There are so many creepypastas that are so much better."
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't they already make a movie on him?
ySy8mcceTno,Omg is so scary
ySy8mcceTno,I had an obsession with slender man when I was a bit younger
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing about SLENDER mAN
ySy8mcceTno,"The people that brought you the emoji movie, now bring you..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepypasta fans are shook. This is



So bad"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender should have a gun in his hand
ySy8mcceTno,2018
ySy8mcceTno,It took 5 years for a dead meme and Creepypasta to get a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why don't you follow the trend and make a train movie instead

ySy8mcceTno,So this os what they call the most scary film of 2018?? Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Nah this is not going to work. The only and the best way it would work is if it was a footage horror movie(like blair witch)
ySy8mcceTno,I love this movie I love slenderman has the best
ySy8mcceTno,another stupid movie

ySy8mcceTno,Honestly I could make a better movie about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T SHY AWAY FROM GORE AND VIOLENCE IN THE MOVIE.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony...😐
ySy8mcceTno,"I like the trailer. If you watch the trailer it doesn't seem to be scary. But if you think about the movie, it could be very exciting."
ySy8mcceTno,How the effing hell did a dead meme get itself a movie adaptation!?
ySy8mcceTno,Soo she became proxy on the end
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?

I mean did they even read any creepy pastas before making this?!"
ySy8mcceTno,Whaatt???....
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is at it again with the terrible movies
ySy8mcceTno,Where's 20 bucks?

ySy8mcceTno,Хрень и в пень
ySy8mcceTno,I dunno rick...
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is rumored to be making a fidget spinner movie so they are officially retarded
ySy8mcceTno,Porco dio
ySy8mcceTno,Okay I think this is a stupid movie but let’s be real we might say it looks stupid but we will still see it someday :) but srsly what is this LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE SLENDY U PEDO
ySy8mcceTno,That's not how the games went
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I feel like this movie is going to be nothing but an abomination...
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years late, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Few years late...
ySy8mcceTno,"A bit 5-6 years late there, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf ?
ySy8mcceTno,"why are people killing themselves and doing other gross stuff? this is slender man and he is only there in the trailer for about six seconds and every one is killing themselves and he's not killing them or even chasing them sony what you are doing is wrong he doesn't go to your head, I don't want a movie where its called slender man where people look at him go crazy and kill themselves I want slender man not some insanity bullshit"
ySy8mcceTno,The original concept is to not look at him. I hope this movie doesnt change that
ySy8mcceTno,"All i Remember in slenderman was theres 8 page in the woods and a guy with a camera that will distorted when see the slenderman face, and the trailer donsen't have any of those



i'm saying is this is not like a slender creepypasta looks like a generic horror movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Why are they making a movie 4 years after slender mans popularity...
ySy8mcceTno,looked kinda lame aside form the chick stabbing herself in the eye.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for reals?
ySy8mcceTno,Thought it was Spider-man
ySy8mcceTno,Good job Sony just 5 years late that’s all (but fr this looks interesting but it’s 2:31 AM rn so I’m not watching this)
ySy8mcceTno,lol what a waste this movie would've been hectic if it came out when slendy was actually relevant
ySy8mcceTno,This was late. Probably cause they spent all their time doing all the stupid ideas first. This would totally work if it was uploaded while Slenderman was still trending.
ySy8mcceTno,Conjuring 3
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that none of the pages were shown even for the trailer made my hopes sink even lower.  Oh well...
ySy8mcceTno,👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍😦😧😨😩😰😟😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😎
ySy8mcceTno,Atv
ySy8mcceTno,he looks like a octopus
ySy8mcceTno,If that comes out I want to ser It
ySy8mcceTno,God what an awful trailer definitely not gonna see or care about this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.....
ySy8mcceTno,My cousin will freak out if he sees this hahaha... the slenderman in mine craft
ySy8mcceTno,Vayyyy aq
ySy8mcceTno,And here I was hoping for just a little bit of proxy time
ySy8mcceTno,It looks good even though it doesn't look very slendemanesque
ySy8mcceTno,Quality SJW?
ySy8mcceTno,"Logan paul, Ugandan Knuckles, SLENDER MAN movie?
What a way to start a year"
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this brings back that craze (it was part of my childhood)
ySy8mcceTno,"Well I was expecting a neo noir involving the slender man stabbing, instead, I got a bucket of dog crap."
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets was the bomb
ySy8mcceTno,Ok?
ySy8mcceTno,My favorite creepypasta finally here xD
ySy8mcceTno,Do they even know what Slender Man is?
ySy8mcceTno,They haven't played the games
ySy8mcceTno,YOU'RE OVER 7 YEARS LATE
ySy8mcceTno,About 6 years too late and looks like every other cookie cutter horror movie. Yeah I'll just stick with marble hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,Give the movie some hope it could be good.
ySy8mcceTno,Did pewdiepie make slenderman more popular or was he always popular
ySy8mcceTno,Damn't i new the jump scare was coming yet it still scared the crap out of me
ySy8mcceTno,Sony could really bank on this. They can have this movie then a jeff the killer movie then have a movie where they fight. like omg!!!
ySy8mcceTno,i think this move can have alot of potential but off the trailer it doesnt make it up enough
ySy8mcceTno,Wow you have made a movie abought my enemy/ worst night mare good job ╭∩╮(-_-)╭∩╮
ySy8mcceTno,did you even see Slenderman once in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is coming back! Yes!
ySy8mcceTno,"Do your research before judging this trailer. Slenderman is an urban Legend created by the internet and before he kills you he torments you with this thing called slender-idis. Look it up for more detaile. How he kills you is by cutting you open and bagging your organs. He also has what he calls proxys. Where he has other do his biddings.

So before you say, ""Duh Its nothing like slenderman would do duh"" do you reasearch. They obv. did theres since threw the trailer it seems like their taking that route. Even in the slender game. The reason you couldnt look at him was bc of that. DO FUCKIN RESEARCH!"
ySy8mcceTno,Stop
ySy8mcceTno,this is stupid
ySy8mcceTno,To be honest i wanna watch this but it dont look that scary
ySy8mcceTno,*HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS?*
ySy8mcceTno,I bet you this is gonna be like the emoji movie or could it be the emoji movie 2 :0
ySy8mcceTno,This look like it going to suck it doesn't even make sense at all I am just like what they probably didn't even play the game it's probably going to be like the death note movie which it suck it was so bad
ySy8mcceTno,#NotMySelnderMan
ySy8mcceTno,"Well





Off to kill myself"
ySy8mcceTno,I think there a little late on this slender guy
ySy8mcceTno,GIVE US AN SCP MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,should i wait for this to come out?becuz it looks fake but at the same time dope asf they should make a <jeff the killer>movie
ySy8mcceTno,It’s a trap!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I like more marble hornest
ySy8mcceTno,Beware! Creepypasta OC's are stirring.
ySy8mcceTno,please let this be the first and last pasta movie.......
ySy8mcceTno,Four/five times the likes from dislikes. So all the people that dislike commented. And the people who liked didnt. Sorry haters u lose. I guess

no but like, I don't need a movie of this, ms peregrine's home for peculiar children already gave a slenderman cameo."
ySy8mcceTno,Top ten anime plot twists
ySy8mcceTno,So spoopy...

ySy8mcceTno,you guys are a little late
ySy8mcceTno,The new emoji movie looks good
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no.... AND ITS SONY MAKIBG IT TOO!
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is a little late to jump on this wagon since the hype for Slenderman is all but dead relevant at that
ySy8mcceTno,"FUCKING STOp
JUST STOP THIS DOESNT NEED TO BE A MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,I have GOT to see this when it comes out! It looks really good!
ySy8mcceTno,I hoped it would have a marble hornets feel to it
ySy8mcceTno,Do yu kno de wey?
ySy8mcceTno,"""Where is my daughter?! People don't just... Disappear...""
So... Is this just a knock off of stranger things, but no awesome friends, and the demigorgion is slender man?"
ySy8mcceTno,I see no one appreciated the fact that they didn’t showed the Slender man in the trailer just once..
ySy8mcceTno,"2010 called, they want their trailer back"
ySy8mcceTno,Ahh hex nah
ySy8mcceTno,Does slenderman show ups in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Do u see slenderman in the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,16% Rotten Tomatoes Score. Calling it.
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is a joke
ySy8mcceTno,"If the word ""generic"" could be summed up in trailer form."
ySy8mcceTno,咁都有得拍。。。。。⋯⋯
ySy8mcceTno,This is not the creepypasta movie that you have been waiting for.
ySy8mcceTno,It all started as a meme then turned into a number of horror video games and now a movie?! Come on!!
ySy8mcceTno,welcome to deep web everybody
ySy8mcceTno,It looks hideous.
ySy8mcceTno,SPOOOOOOOKAY
ySy8mcceTno,This can go either very good or very bad...
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like something that’s in the theaters in gta 5
ySy8mcceTno,"1:25 ""MIH"""
ySy8mcceTno,No no no no no!
ySy8mcceTno,Itf fake?
ySy8mcceTno,"I know it's just a trailer but I feel they're not actually making a movie about what the slender man is really like

It feels like just some generic horror movie where slender man just happens to be the villain. He's supposed to induce psychological horror into you, messing with your mind and making you paranoid. He looks like some generic crazed slasher monster in this trailer.

Like I said, it is just a trailer, but I hope they more closely follow the Marble Hornets style of horror"
ySy8mcceTno,They know it's a dead meme right?
ySy8mcceTno,theres already a slenderman movie. its alright..
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, I think this movie'll be a missed opportunity. Here's my spin:

Instead of the focus being on a couple of girls dealing with the Slender Man, it should be an anthology film. In this version, it would focus on some campers telling their own stories of the Slender Man, giving in to the campfire-story nature of Creepypastas.

Here though, it just seems...bleh."
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer leads to absolutely no-where. It makes no sense and has no plot. They are ripping off an urban legend and attempting to make profit out of it just like they did with emoji's. This is going to fall HARD...
ySy8mcceTno,"It's almost as if the creators only knew about Slender Man through the stabbing incident and based the film on that rather than the years of accumulated blogs, vlogs, and community lore."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender was presented as a story and a game. it was always that way. i dont know why you should turn it into a film. we already got the stabbing of a 13yr old girl that was influenced by him, and another involving someones mom."
ySy8mcceTno,"I love Creepypasta, but this doesn't seem to have anything to do with Slenderman... I'll still see it, but if it sucks I'll be pissed."
ySy8mcceTno,About time they make a slender man movi
ySy8mcceTno,6th grade me is quaking
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like one of those Netflix movies you wish you didn’t watch.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man is not u stabing urself
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't know sony was making two movies about Spider-Man this year XD
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow.






What a trash trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,I was waiting it for so long 😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,_Hmm This Trailer For IT 2 Looks Legit....._
ySy8mcceTno,OK this has nothing to do with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Sooo slender man had like a second of screentime in this trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,Memes the game the movie coming soon
ySy8mcceTno,Where's slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"So listen. I was thinking.. Hollywood is running out of ideas and since Slenderman is a GAME, why make it. But Hollywood is short on ideas so I said why Not. A day later I Get this. 😐"
ySy8mcceTno,Story seems all over the place. They could make a good Slender Man movie with some real good ideas. This all mind playing thing is weird.
ySy8mcceTno,"Next up, in 2021, Undertale: The Movie!"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm looking forward for that
ySy8mcceTno,Are we back in 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,1:04 didn’t know this was stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Im sure the Director of this movie never know who Slender Man is
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is pathetic
ySy8mcceTno,Esto se va a poner chido
ySy8mcceTno,Ikr
ySy8mcceTno,None of this makes sense just saying
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my god!!! Yasssss I love it I want to see it now!!! 😍😍😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is literally one of the most popular Creepypastas it took you long enough 💁🏽‍♀️
ySy8mcceTno,Sony's next film:  I Haz Cheeseburger?
ySy8mcceTno,This honestly doesn't really resemble Slender Man that much to me at all. It's more like it's own horror film then a SlenderMan movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, there always will be more plots for horror movies cause of the outdated creepypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,CANT WAIT
ySy8mcceTno,"Maybe this movie will get to Guinness World Records 2019 for ""First movie based on a creepypasta character and video game"""
ySy8mcceTno,"I think they missed everything that makes Slenderman scary:
 - We never see him moving, yet he gets closer somehow.
 - We don't know much about his aspect or nature, just his humanoid silhouette (This looks like we'll even have a scientific explanation at some point).
 - He seems to attack in a way we simply don't understand and therefore we don't know what to do against it (which is even kind of elegant in my opinion)."
ySy8mcceTno,what about the people who cant see          #blind
ySy8mcceTno,How bad is this movie gonna suck? Lol
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all are mad late with this entire movie trailer. Not saying it’s gonna flop but nobody seems to care about this whole slender man thing anymore. Not even fans of creepy pasta.
ySy8mcceTno,Another smashing success by Sony.....
ySy8mcceTno,"for the love of god i hope you have done your research on Slenderman. He is not just from an old school horror game, Sony. Implement the creepypastas and game and legends into the story. 

Next year: Jeff the Killer the Movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Why This? Why, They could've picked so many other creepypastas that actually deserve a movie, not this crap. I hope this movie fails, and quite honestly this is a dishonor to the creepypasta community"
ySy8mcceTno,Puta pero que feo trailer!! Espero que la pelicula este buena
ySy8mcceTno,Playing Minecraft on hardcore mode scares me more than this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Waste too gaze incentive survival freshman deep obtain lamp teacher.
ySy8mcceTno,D FAC
ySy8mcceTno,Fan fiction then game then movie whats next a full on fledged cartoon
ySy8mcceTno,"fam, i've waited since i was a pre-pubescent angsty baby for this movie. if this isn't good, i'm gonna throw hands"
ySy8mcceTno,4 years too late anyways I'm going to watch Jonny test while I listen to Britney Spears and after that make ad revenue on my channel that is very stable at this point and after that I'm going to watch Wassabi Productions later.
ySy8mcceTno,Who’s down to come to the movies with me 👋🏾
ySy8mcceTno,But we already have Marble Hornets! 🤔😐
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't really know what to think abou this...i mean it's cool that a creepypasta i used to like when younger is (finally) getting an actual movie,but eh,looks pretty cliche to be fair."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is ok but i want a move based of SCP contsinment breach
ySy8mcceTno,Wow nice to strike when the irons hot
ySy8mcceTno,One of the biggest flops of 2018. I’m calling it right now.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!
ySy8mcceTno,lol a bit late
ySy8mcceTno,I see Sony wanted to appeal to the kids who kill their friends for him. That's the only reason why this exists.
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, my comment got deleted rip"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man was like my childhood for so long, but I don't think I'll be watching this due to how stupid it looks -_-"
ySy8mcceTno,You're 8 years late Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Ew was tht an eye tht was stabbed?!
ySy8mcceTno,2 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, because I like scary movies, I'll give this movie a shot. Although, I normally hate Slenderman and I feel like this movie confirms what I believe was already obvious: With the crappy Slenderman B movies on Xfinity Streampix, the HBO documentary, a few specials on TV (Destination America, if I remember right. I don't know. I forgot what channel it was on last year here in Oregon), and that NOBODY here where I live can shut up about Slenderman straight to the point where he's become pretty much our new Bigfoot (merely a metaphor, not literally), Slenderman has CLEARLY overstayed his welcome. But since I love a scary movie, I will give this one a chance for the sake of the horror genre."
ySy8mcceTno,Spoopy all ya need is a sweet little girl named Sally and this would be perfect. 👌- 3- 👍
ySy8mcceTno,"Yo... 

You think Markipliers gonna be happy?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Thank god Scott Cawthon trusted WB with his FNaF project, anyone who goes to Sony is fucked."
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like I’m the only one who thinks his might actually be good. (Probably cause I’m a creepypasta nerd) COUGH COUGH
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so tired of slender man only because of the those two girls that stabbed their classmates 19 times. (If you’re in Wisconsin you’ll most likely know what I’m talking about)
ySy8mcceTno,"Should of made this like 7 years ago. But remember we’re dealing with Sony here. AKA the gods behind the Emoji Movie.

*Sony may I get a PlayStation 5 now?*"
ySy8mcceTno,"This raises one more qurstion...





WHEN IS FNAF MOVIE COMING OUT!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,oh right I forgot it's still 2009
ySy8mcceTno,What the heck is this about?
ySy8mcceTno,Do they still have the Easter egg where you can kill him?
ySy8mcceTno,It’s a slender men movie but the barley show him
ySy8mcceTno,This isn’t what slender man did. He killed people by hanging them by their spines not making them kill themself
ySy8mcceTno,#notmyslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Why

ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait! Fear Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,It's a little late don't you think?
ySy8mcceTno,is this an attempt to make the emoji movie look good

ySy8mcceTno,What is this the exorcist. I swear that other movie that they said wasn’t Slenderman but we all knew it was based off Slenderman was better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,I Don't get how this is about Slenderman? all it shows is maggots
ySy8mcceTno,El trailer es malisimo y la pelicula no se ve que va a estar buena
ySy8mcceTno,¿?¿?¿?¿?¿?
ySy8mcceTno,"Omg Slenderman is in the movie
😱😱😱😨😨😨😵😵😵🤤🤤🤤"
ySy8mcceTno,#1 movie of 2010 here guys
ySy8mcceTno,where is my first person view
ySy8mcceTno,So this is like based on the bye bye man because he gets in your  head and makes you do things get it!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Next year they're making a Fruit Ninja movie. 🍉🍌🍓🍑🍎
ySy8mcceTno,So is this like a joke trailer or is this gunna actually be a thing??????
ySy8mcceTno,"I kinda like this concept of slender, 
1. Gets in your head...like a virus followed by hallucinations and parinoia 
2. Slowly starts psychologically and physically effecting the victim 
3. Symptoms from step 1 are worse 
4. Then makes victim commit suicide or Slender shows himself and kills you himself
5. And maybe as fan service one of the victims could become a proxy 
But anyways I can see why people have many problems with this movie but I am going to give it a shot."
ySy8mcceTno,Kd os BR?
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer looks good, but doesn't seem to resemble slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,WTF?
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems like your average horror movie that relates pretty little to slenderman, thought if they were gonna make a slender movie mine as well base it off slender the arrival which has an ok story ;D"
ySy8mcceTno,I probably would have been more into this if it weren't for the fact that a girl was stabbed like seventy times because of this creepypasta. It kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth to see a company like Sony promote media about Slenderman when media about it is what caused that girl to go through so much trauma.
ySy8mcceTno,what what WHAAAT is this this is slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Bad trailer
ySy8mcceTno,**Waiting for the CP Fandom**
ySy8mcceTno,Why are so many people hating? It seems like a pretty good movie to me..
ySy8mcceTno,"Why must you ruin everything I love, sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,this is gonna flop so hard
ySy8mcceTno,No this can't be a movie coming out
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh please. The trailers for The Ring and the Woman in Black were scarier than this.(Yawns). Nope, I'll pass on this movie. Smh"
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,"But...why? No one wants this, slender Man needs no more attention"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks as if someone who never heard of slender man was asked to make a movie about it... just one more movie Sony will mess up!
ySy8mcceTno,Dumbest shot I’ve ever seen wtf😂😂😂🤦‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been a big hit in like 2011
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be tragic
ySy8mcceTno,IS this for real is there a real movie coming out OMG
ySy8mcceTno,"N o
W h y
T h i s  w a s  m o r e  t h a n  f i v e  y e a r s  a g o"
ySy8mcceTno,whats wrong with a fat man?
ySy8mcceTno,by the creators of the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh I’m somewhat excited for this. If only they had made it sooner
ySy8mcceTno,He’s just trying to say hi jeez y r they so rude
ySy8mcceTno,Why....
ySy8mcceTno,Cringe
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm going to watch it when it comes out 






pray for me"
ySy8mcceTno,I 💛 slender man
ySy8mcceTno,They're 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,The first slednerman was crap why do they think anotherone would be good
ySy8mcceTno,это не фейк?
ySy8mcceTno,"Also when are they going to make a ""Jeff The Killer"" movie are a ""The Rake"" movie, they also want the spotlight, but I can see why they chose Slenderman because he is the most famous Creepypasta ever!"
ySy8mcceTno,Just don't bother Sony... It will flop. I will not charge you for this consulting.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks gayy
ySy8mcceTno,The real horror is how terrible this movie looks
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it’s kind of a good choice this was done so late. Even though had a bit of an obsession with slenderman and creepypasta when he was popular and would have loved this movie, everyone else had slenderman shoved in there face in every corner of the internet. It would seem forced and rushed with no effort to really be good since it was just made to make money off of some popular internet thing.  Now it has somewhat of a chance to be good I think."
ySy8mcceTno,This has literally nothing to do with Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Make Ben Drowned a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda late to be trying to cash in on the slender Man trend ain't it Sony? I mean you're bound to get a few people paying to see this if out of boredom than anything else but it's been like 6 years how much do you guys think you'll actually make off this?
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabron y te mato
ySy8mcceTno,It should have been called Pewdiepie: The beginning
ySy8mcceTno,WHY IS THIS COMING?!
ySy8mcceTno,Xd
ySy8mcceTno,Frustration act choose stiff via likely satellite medical involve
ySy8mcceTno,This movie will probably be shitty but my inner creepypasta obsessed 13 year old self can’t help but be excited
ySy8mcceTno,Because we all know how well video game movies turn out...
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing like the legend
ySy8mcceTno,I really want to see this movie now
ySy8mcceTno,American horror movies are never scary
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 Creepypasta Writers called 
They want their Idea back"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes finally! Slendy is coming to the big screens! First he was one of the best horror games, and now he is going to be one of the best horror movies! Can't wait to watch it!"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG this has to be real
ySy8mcceTno,Slender game was much terrifying...
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are five yars late
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years waiting 
Better be good"
ySy8mcceTno,Confused
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh great, get ready for the entire theater to be filled with 8-13 year olds."
ySy8mcceTno,"this an early April Fools joke, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all are a little late
ySy8mcceTno,Loud=Scary
ySy8mcceTno,Esto no es slenderman... Donde putas esta el loquendo??????
ySy8mcceTno,But why does he make weird monster noises. He never did that.
ySy8mcceTno,Where the hell - I barely saw slender man. This story has nothing to do with him
ySy8mcceTno,"Me; wow 2018! Can't wait to see what comes out of it!

Sony Pictures; HEY! REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE 12 AND OBSESSED WITH- 

Me; aaaAAAAAAAAAAAA

Also here's an edit; Dear Sony... an SCP movie would be wayyyy better,"
ySy8mcceTno,Possesus by da devul
ySy8mcceTno,This looks dumb and cheesy
ySy8mcceTno,#youcantseeme
ySy8mcceTno,Plz no
ySy8mcceTno,I mean this looks good and all but will it capture the true horror of Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,a little late on this one guys
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn't look that bad, to be honest. Looks way better than the Marble Hornets movie Always Watching, where they do a complete disservice to the source material. And Sony has made great films in the past and they're not the only company behind this. This might work. I'm being optimistic about this. Slender Man has much more promise than a Jeff the Killer movie."
ySy8mcceTno,i did not expected a slenderman movei to be like this 😟
ySy8mcceTno,When people run out of ideas. 🤣
ySy8mcceTno,"apuesto a que va a ser mala como ""emojis the movie"" :v"
ySy8mcceTno,you're about 8 years too late lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Hell nah to the naw nnaw naw hell to the haw hell  to the naw naw naw naw naw







HEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLL NAHHHHH"
ySy8mcceTno,Mierda solo el trailer da miedo
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,Ha...ha... senpai
ySy8mcceTno,It ain't 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Just 4 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, you’re 7 years too late."
ySy8mcceTno,"Man not even slender man himself would like the movie
*Slender man watches trailer to his movie*
*says in his mind* Wtf is this
*slender man goes to Sony pictures*
Worker: yes how may I help you
Slender man: yes may I talk to the person that made this movie about me
Worker: sure let me call him 
*worker calls the man that made this* 
The person that made the movie: yes
Worker: sorry to interupt you but you have a visitor
The man that's the movie: ok send him up here
Worker: ok *ends call* ok he would like to see you mister slender man
Slender man: ok
*Slender man goes to the guys office*
The man that made the movie: hello and who may you be
Slender man: I am slender man and I am guessing that your the one that made this movie
The man that made the movie: yes I am and what do you want
Slender man: I think the movie is garbage cause Jeff the killer called me and told me to check out the movie you guys made of me and I was like ok and when I seen it I thought it was horrible then ben texted me and said that you guys might have ruined my reputation for creepypasta
The man that made the movie: ... *runs*"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally slender man in real life! THEY FINALLY HAVE A MOVIE!
ySy8mcceTno,They're serious
ySy8mcceTno,Dear sony. Please learn how to make a good trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony why? Get your movie better it will ruin the franchise. Slenderman never did those things play the game for once smh
ySy8mcceTno,Lol took you like what? 10 years?
ySy8mcceTno,Yay i'm dying for the movie :D
ySy8mcceTno,I like how the music just cuts when she kills herself
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm gonna need an edit of this trailer where at the end we hear ""NO WIFIN' IN THE CLUB, GIMME TWENTY DOLLAS"" on repeat."
ySy8mcceTno,That was the worst trailer I have ever seen. looks like a 10 year old made it an hour before it was due....
ySy8mcceTno,Русские есть!?)
ySy8mcceTno,5 years ago called. They found out you toucha their spaghet.
ySy8mcceTno,Cool❤
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully the movie lives up to the game
ySy8mcceTno,is yongma promo for this
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 Return the Slab
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,so bad
ySy8mcceTno,Can't the dare devil beat up slender man because he's blind.
ySy8mcceTno,It kinda reminds me of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,"*sees logo of Sony* 

*closes video*"
ySy8mcceTno,Eh. Not excited.
ySy8mcceTno,Crazy
ySy8mcceTno,Have they even seen Marble Hornets?
ySy8mcceTno,"Is it just me or do they already have so much wrong, just seeing the trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not sure what to make of this trailer.
It barely even resembles something Slenderman related and almost seems more like a generic scary movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait, wasn't there a slender man movie before?"
ySy8mcceTno,this trailer made me want to watch the main movie LOL
ySy8mcceTno,"Cringy at it's finest, but would love to see"
ySy8mcceTno,"What is this trash. Oh wait, sony pictures, now I get it....."
ySy8mcceTno,MY EMO PHASE IS COMING BACK.
ySy8mcceTno,Let's hope it has some decency
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks bad, effects are cheap"
ySy8mcceTno,"Y’all know that slender has a story that you can all look up, it’s not just a meme and from what’s shown I feel like it can be the perfect slender movie but sadly normies and sheep are going to run it into the ground before it even has the chance."
ySy8mcceTno,Hahah sure
ySy8mcceTno,Ya decearia verla <3
ySy8mcceTno,Dunno why but feels like a reboot of Stranger things.
ySy8mcceTno,WHY?!?
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is pretty crappy but it still seems like a movie I would watch
ySy8mcceTno,Why...
ySy8mcceTno,How much of your soul you want to sale that their gonna make a cinematic universe of the creepypastas ?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,CGI MAN
ySy8mcceTno,WoooooW
ySy8mcceTno,"my thoughts:
why phycological horror instead of jumpscare horror?
save that for the among the sleep movie.
P.S. nice way to interprate the slender stabbing."
ySy8mcceTno,Bwahaha this is so stupid 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Why so many negative comments?
ySy8mcceTno,Took long enough
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who looks forward to it?
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,This is the new X-Files. Like it so far
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't get the whole hate behind this,looks pretty cool"
ySy8mcceTno,Copiou um pouco a fita da Samara
ySy8mcceTno,Are these people insane a girl was almost killed from this a while ago
ySy8mcceTno,I guarantee this is going to be less scary than the game
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Do a movie about the two girls that almost stabbed their friend to death over Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wait its Sony. Never mind I'm gonna skip this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Its must be creppy?
ySy8mcceTno,This should have come out when slender Man was still popular
ySy8mcceTno,Memes aside it actually looks like it could be good
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!1!1!
ySy8mcceTno,Directed by Sylvain White........... GG.
ySy8mcceTno,This is basically copying stranger things.
ySy8mcceTno,"Didn't the slenderman craze end back in 2011-2012? And now they're making a movie 6 years later? Well, I'm not saying the movie is going to be bad, just wondering.."
ySy8mcceTno,Mas te vale no cagarla prro :u
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome back edgy creepypasta lover me. :’)
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting 8 years. Better be good cause if not slender man is gonna slamm my face into my keybojf6383vrig8r7gnihctawsyawla3rjrjjh Bjornh namrednels

ySy8mcceTno,"5 years late, Sony..."
ySy8mcceTno,the beginning gave me a stranger things vibe
ySy8mcceTno,Vou assistir  esse filme adoro o slederman
ySy8mcceTno,Looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,"It didn't even look like Slender man, more like the Bye Bye man"
ySy8mcceTno,WHY IS THIS A THING?!?
ySy8mcceTno,Won't top marblehornets
ySy8mcceTno,¿Qué sigue? ¿Jeff the killer de parte de Warner Bros?
ySy8mcceTno,"When usas internet explorer , y llegas tarde xd"

ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is wrong with Sony?!
ySy8mcceTno,I have a feeling this is not going to be as IT...
ySy8mcceTno,Türkler Selamun Aleyküm
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna butcher  the creepypasta....
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf""..."
ySy8mcceTno,"I can see the fan girls already.

ySy8mcceTno,2:21 Ender Man

ySy8mcceTno,Finnaly a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Oh that's nice
ySy8mcceTno,Oh ok
ySy8mcceTno,Oh
ySy8mcceTno,I feel bad about the girl who got stopped 20+ times by two girls first this reason because they thought slender man was real
ySy8mcceTno,Compete and utter rubbish. I see glitches nothing.
ySy8mcceTno,Nightmare Fuel: The Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I can relate to Slender. We’re both really tall, have freakishly long fingers, we have pale skin, and we drive people insane. The only difference is that I actually have a face."
ySy8mcceTno,10 bucks says the movie will end with static
ySy8mcceTno,"No sé que pensar de esto, deberia emocionarme pero tengo miedo de que la caguen, como siempre suele pasar"
ySy8mcceTno,This is as bad as fart on your father's meal... or worse
ySy8mcceTno,This is idiotic
ySy8mcceTno,But... marble hornets already exists! Come on my Sony dudes.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks boring
ySy8mcceTno,Theres an ad on this ad
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is only five years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,Bokta çıkabilir?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ladies and gentlemen, they did it. The geniuses at Sony realized that it was futile to try to make the best movie so they've been making the worst ones they can and they've finally done it - the absolute worst movie ever made."
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see how bad this movie will be!
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok I went to 1:23, can't hear it."
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER MAN ❤️❤️😀😀😀
ySy8mcceTno,I clicked this video on accident
ySy8mcceTno,Was slender even in the trailer? I kinda just skimmed through it. I just wanna know what exactly they made slender man look like. Also with the Sony pictures logo on it I have no hope for this film. Not that I’m really a big watcher of horror since I am not a huge fan
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah but is Viktor Surge getting any credit or profit from this
ySy8mcceTno,"Ever since i heard of slender man, i always wanted to know more and now their making a movie 👌"
ySy8mcceTno,Huele a Death Note

ySy8mcceTno,Such a gay trailer. Doesn't even show slender man for a full second in view of at least moderate close up
ySy8mcceTno,When idiots are 6 years late...
ySy8mcceTno,Sony plz dont waste money on productions like the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,And then we lived happily ever after
ySy8mcceTno,One of the worst trailers I’ve ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm just waiting for the Emoji Movie 2 to be announced on April 1st for everyone to think it was a joke but in reality, it's actually gonna come out and you all got fooled. Calling it."
ySy8mcceTno,"but you better make an epic movie, I've been waiting for this moment for years"
ySy8mcceTno,"it looks like a shitty movie tbh, and still had made it to the trending section."

Thanks."

ySy8mcceTno,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,"in my opinion, this movie tries too hard to look scary, but maybe when the movie releases it might surprise my expectations, in more ways than one probably


despite the fact that this film is literally based off of an urban legend created like 5 fucking years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Nonsense
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this a comedy ? 
The stabbing with scalpel was funny lol"

Hey Jim what are the kids into these day.
Oh my emo daughter just discovered slenderman. Looks pweety spooky."
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, a Slender Man movie :)"

ySy8mcceTno,I think it's going to be about slender sickness as well..
ySy8mcceTno,Yet another shitty movie that will send sony into another spiral of bankruptcy.
ySy8mcceTno,Some parts of it really look like the Ring video tape moments
ySy8mcceTno,"So what's next...Jeff the killer or something like that
Give us Popeye instead of just some creepypasta bs"
ySy8mcceTno,it not even close to any slenderman story

ySy8mcceTno,"Just take this in, the Slender Man creepypasta was the actual motivation for an attempted murder by two girls and was popular enough to get its own film."
ySy8mcceTno,From the creators of Shrek
ySy8mcceTno,"If they released this a few years ago, maybe it could do well, but the Slender Man craze has since passed."
ySy8mcceTno,"little late there
☻"
ySy8mcceTno,"i understand that selling tickets is paramount, but shouldn't the girl be a size 12 ?"
ySy8mcceTno,"1956: scary and creepy also disturbing horror movies
2018: wth? This isnt even scary horror movie!"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it's going to be the most generic film ever.
ySy8mcceTno,That is so not right that is to scary!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol i remember my Slenderman phase back in 2013 thinking he was real

But fast forward 5 years later and another slender movie comes out like wtf"
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda lame cashing in on a fad several years after the fact...
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope there is ticci toby, masky, hoodie and Kate the chaser in the movie and if not I hope they get there own movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Where the static at tho?
ySy8mcceTno,"Amazing to think how a random creepypasta about a decade year old has had its rise to fame, getting many fangames and then finally getting released with an official slender the arrival. And now? Now we have a movie that's coming out, I'm hyped. Sure, by now Slenderman is old, but I have a great history with it and it really brings back memories so I'll gladly watch this."
ySy8mcceTno,Im excited
ySy8mcceTno,"So they actually
 made/ r making a movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,the girl is like no mo problems for me
ySy8mcceTno,Its 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the gay elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,Prediction : it is going to flop _big_ time..
ySy8mcceTno,"Its probably going to suck. 
Slender Man is scary because of what you don't see.
He's a subtle background character that kills you unnoticed, like a stalking assassin.
You only catch glimpses of him because he disappears right when you see him, and only see him when you die.
The only good way to direct a slender man movie, is to make it a suspenseful horror (much like a mix between it follows, babadok, halloween, and psycho.)
Basically, take the ""monster follows slowly in the background"" from It follows, the erie, never see, but inescabable monster from babadok, and the pyschological thriller from psycho, and put in a dash of murder from halloween."
ySy8mcceTno,Late 8 years
ySy8mcceTno,Yup I'll watch this🖒
ySy8mcceTno,"Hi, i have a more questions, can you give me your mail?"
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks creepier than IT  (2017) actually.

Edit: Also my prediction is that this will get a 17% or smaller or a bit higher on rotten tomatoes.
I don't think this movie will do good. It's too ""quote on quote"" out of date from the original thing on YouTube that probably released back in what? 2009,or 2010?
Sorry Sony but,at least you tried...."
ySy8mcceTno,"In another 8 years, Slendy
The Sexy and misunderstood creepypasta who lives alone in a lonely and dark forest, looking for the love from a new town girl.
She meets Jeffy and Slendy fights with him for the love of her
Blahblahblahblahblah"
ySy8mcceTno,*where is my daughter*
ySy8mcceTno,Bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks very mediocre, but we'll see. I kinda feel like Slender Man works best as an Internet only narrative. It's more mysterious that way. Found footage is hard to do in a 90 minute to 120 minute feature... what Everyman Hybrid (early on at least, i never finished the series), Marble Hornets, and ARG web series like them did right was they were able to build an entire universe around a YouTube channel rather than just one movie. It's creepier to stumble upon a YouTube channel that his this faceless dude in the background of seemingly normal videos than it is to go into a theater knowing what you're getting into."
ySy8mcceTno,Only 5 years behind. Should have made a pewdipie amnesia custom story part 37 movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Only thing that looks scary about this movie is the fact that it exists. Think ill stick to watching Marble Hornets if i ever want a slender man film that gives me creeps.
ySy8mcceTno,wow thats cool i got goosebumps!
ySy8mcceTno,Sony always late to the punch with the relevant memes and tropes of the time
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Slenderman does whatever a Slenderman can
ySy8mcceTno,"*Sony*

*”We don’t make good movies”*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Y tho? You’re, like, a million years late, according to internet time."
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t look good.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's fake
ySy8mcceTno,I thought we left this boi in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,When people hate you so you make a stranger things rip off.Kinda.
ySy8mcceTno,Do you kno de wai ?
ySy8mcceTno,It honestly doesn't seem like a Slender Man movie... It's not like you'd picture it...
ySy8mcceTno,Time for all those weird emo kids to watch this. Btw looks super boring
ySy8mcceTno,PUTA QUE PARIU
ySy8mcceTno,the memes are comming
ySy8mcceTno,"dang it, they make tis movie after slender man has been proved it's fake"
ySy8mcceTno,Should've done this when his fandom was ALIVE
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man, aka ""Dead Meme the Movie"""
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks bad. Like I am sorry but I feel like it will suck.... Could be wrong though ¬~¬
ySy8mcceTno,"At 1:28, Another anyone?"
ySy8mcceTno,"We're not gonna waiting for Slenderman movie!
😱"
ySy8mcceTno,TBH it looks more gross than scary
ySy8mcceTno,"Walks in forest*
Sees slender man*
Spits on him*
GOD DISRESPEKT"
ySy8mcceTno,I think we won't actually see slender other then his shadows in the movie but that's pretty cool too
ySy8mcceTno,Im dat one person casually scrolling down the comments and looking at the likes and comments to get likes because I’m jealous of everyone getting likes but me :)
ySy8mcceTno,Makes me think of evil experiments and drugs instead of Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,NO FUCKING WAY
ySy8mcceTno,Poop
ySy8mcceTno,I'm prepared for the scares
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh who is ready for stick man the mvie
ySy8mcceTno,Best comedy of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it had to be Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Why couldn't you just leave this one alone hhhhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,"You guys are so late- There's already been two Slender Man movies XD
I remembered renting one of them too- lol, welp might as well and watch it when it comes out just for the hell of it"
ySy8mcceTno,"Man, I hope this doesn’t suck. Trying to be hopeful... 😅"
ySy8mcceTno,but why? why would you do this?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender doesn’t growl..
ySy8mcceTno,Im worried this movie will bring more people out of the woodworks claimin to kill in the name of Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,YES YES YES YES YES MAI CHILDHOOD HAS RETURNED YES YES YES YES NOSTALGIA IS COMIN BACK YES YES YES YES
ySy8mcceTno,Do u kno de wae
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope they go the original story and theme for slenderman (before the video game took off). More akin to everymanhybrid, marble hornets, tribetwelve youtube channel style stories. they all had a consistent lore, none of this ""don't look at him"" stuff or ""lost in the woods he kills you in one night"" stuff. He would stalk a single person for upwards of a couple months. Looking at them from afar driving them crazy before he got them. if you weren't afraid of him or didn't believe in him you were safe, but once you knew about him and feared him you were his"
ySy8mcceTno,Another shitty movie from Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look great.
ySy8mcceTno,"omg the scariest part of the trailer was the maggots, godamn hate them..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: ""God I sure am glad that meme is dead and buried""
Sony: *grabs shovel*"
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala y te parto la madre cabrón >:v
ySy8mcceTno,DIS IS DE WEA OF DA DEVAL
ySy8mcceTno,Very confusing not sure if it’s gonna be good tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Up next... FIDGET SPINNER - the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,this looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,Esta película va a ser una mierda
ySy8mcceTno,For the love of god plz stop
ySy8mcceTno,SPENDER MAN
ySy8mcceTno,So ok they made a tone of games about him why in the hell are they making a movie non of us asked for this
ySy8mcceTno,Is it 2012 again?
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated film of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Somebody touch my spaghet
ySy8mcceTno,2013: The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman will always found you
ySy8mcceTno,cagala y te mato wey >:v
ySy8mcceTno,What is this world coming to. .this utube made video is being glamourized after girl stabs her friend because of this character. These are demons and the bible warns about watching the type 9f things..its an open door for Satan to come and steal from you
ySy8mcceTno,*First five seconds of the trailer* *clicks out the video
ySy8mcceTno,All of the Saw are less scary than this.... sorry Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"If you watch this without reading the title, I bet you you'll think that this is part of Stranger Things."
ySy8mcceTno,No. Just no.
ySy8mcceTno,About time sony
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman es real no se burlen de el con esta pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,"Even though I can definitely see this movie going downhill, I am very interested and a little excited to see it, just to criticize how it was a bad idea"
ySy8mcceTno,boy
ySy8mcceTno,please tell me finn wolfhard is in this
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this for long time BUT THANK FOR FOR MAKING IT
ySy8mcceTno,Eh
ySy8mcceTno,When your watching this in a dark room and hear a noise.
ySy8mcceTno,I like fish
ySy8mcceTno,"did you know?
the slenderman is a based on the creepypasta idk if slenderman is real or not?"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like Hollywood is going to ruined a good franchise yet again. But who.knows it might be scary like the game.
ySy8mcceTno,He is SLENDER! he's in the woods and he's tired.. (Conan) hahaha ... dumbest horror character ever
ySy8mcceTno,10/10 ign
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting Jeff the Killer.......
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie that's both from a game AND horror?
Nope!"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't it a little late to cash in on this trend?
ySy8mcceTno,Horror movies like these are what give him and other pastas bad names. This is annoying that people ruin slender's name.
ySy8mcceTno,oh no
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Marble Hornets and To The Ark?
ySy8mcceTno,Hell's yeah
ySy8mcceTno,Probably a fake
ySy8mcceTno,"looks really generic, and i don't like the old memes"
ySy8mcceTno,Shitty trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,I like horror games but not horror movies.And a cousin of mine likes to watch horror movies (Why do they let him?He is 10 years old!)but gets scared of horror games (which is extremely weird because he watches horror movies. My aunt told me that in his 10th birthday he went with his friends to watch Annabelle Creation)I don't know if my cousin will DARE ME TO WATCH THIS MOVIE JUST BECAUSE I LIKE HORROR GAMES AND THIS IS BASED ON A HORROR GAME (by the way I have never played the game before)
ySy8mcceTno,I know it sucks as soon as I saw Sony's logo
ySy8mcceTno,"THERE'S GONNA BE A SLENDER MAN MOVIE?!?!?!?!THIS WILL BE THE VERY FIRST MOVIE BASED ON A CREEPY PASTA!!!! WHAT WILL BE NEXT,JEFF THE KILLER??!?!EYELESS JACK?!?!!??SMILE DOG!?!?!"
ySy8mcceTno,God this is gonna be dissapointing. I already know it will be awful
ySy8mcceTno,Man I wanted channel zero to do this somebody else took the cake
ySy8mcceTno,This looks boring.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony should sell their movie studio to Disney now that they have the chance.
ySy8mcceTno,Who the hell told them to make this ?!?
ySy8mcceTno,Wes Moy sanic moovee trayler
ySy8mcceTno,Ok that end part is fucked up
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, you are a bit late with this, Slenderman has not been a relevant meme in several years, you might as well make a Harambe documentary to be released in 2025"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wanna hear a joke?



Sony Pictures"
ySy8mcceTno,"Aaaaaand Marble Hornets was more scary than that movie looks on, what, a thousandth the budget?"
ySy8mcceTno,Will I be able to watch this on my xbox?
ySy8mcceTno,"this is so fliping scary
i want to wahtch this"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is john cena's disabled brother ! 😑
#Can u see him ?"
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que salga el Loquendo!😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Please don't ruin this, Sony. I remember the ol' Slenderman days."
ySy8mcceTno,Kind of sucks (we barely see Slender Man) BUT it's AMAZING!! So exited #CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,😶  speachless
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't think Sony was that desparate.
ySy8mcceTno,MY DREAMS CAME TRUE
ySy8mcceTno,"Leave it to a large company most likely ran by old white men to not know what's relevant or trending, Sony please. This should have came out 8 years ago. That's not to this movie can't be good. In fact I've always wanted to see a movie adaptation of a creepypasta. So please. If you are going to make another piece of outdated trend content at least make this movie well written, scary, and follow the source material."
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, Sony. You’ve finally hit rock bottom."
ySy8mcceTno,This sadly doesn't look worth my time.... I wish it looked better because my whole family likes slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,This should have been a thing  years ago man.
ySy8mcceTno,3spoopy5me
ySy8mcceTno,Only 2010 kids will remember making LEGO animations of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This movie was awesome I just watched it :D
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly I thought it was a good trailer but I’m a big fan of creepy pastas but I saw no creepy pastas symbols and I look foreword to see this movie and I think that this will be a great movie like if u watch the old slenderman movies they aren’t cool plus slenderman teleports to so another heads up 
All u haters F off cuz at lease it’s a horror movie not something that gives u facts"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a horrible movie
ySy8mcceTno,Cuando recién llegas se hizo famoso y ya paso su hora
ySy8mcceTno,"What next, Jim Carrey as the Smiling Man?"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like about 50 other horror movie trailers over the last few years
ySy8mcceTno,Im sure that in the whole movie we will only see slender man for 2 minutes.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow. First Emoji movie, now this. What next Sony? Five Nights at Freddy's? Minecraft?  ugh.... I think they're getting desperate."
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for years for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie wont be scary, it was not even bit scary, no horror movie has scared me"
ySy8mcceTno,Too late....
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,From the company that brought you such hits as the Emoji Movie and Amazing Spiderman 2.
ySy8mcceTno,In my opinion if we were talking about a creepypasta movie Zalgo should have got one.
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing's scary except for the beginning when the maggots were squirming. Like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,"Shitty, unoriginal, basic horror story"
ySy8mcceTno,Umad Wilson tenia razon :v
ySy8mcceTno,que carajo le hicieron a Slenderman >:v no me jodan!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I really really really really hope Jack and Tobby do not make a camieo
ySy8mcceTno,WENDY
ySy8mcceTno,Is it only me who thinks a fanmade video is so much better than this?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman has been dead for fucking years and now they decide to come out with a movie for him.
ySy8mcceTno,Smd this urban legend is soooooooo 2011
ySy8mcceTno,If he doesn't have his suit on and tenticales I'm out
ySy8mcceTno,"Movie probably would have been a better found footage, 3/10"
ySy8mcceTno,Awful
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man does not know da way, he need ebola to know da way"
ySy8mcceTno,"This legitimately looks awful. I LOVE going to the movies, this is a hard pass for me."
ySy8mcceTno,Am I going to die seven days after watching this trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman is still a thing, huh..."
ySy8mcceTno,man the slenderman games get more real every year
ySy8mcceTno,"A horror movie about a meme, we really came that far."
ySy8mcceTno,They are about 6 yers too late for this...
ySy8mcceTno,What next? Jeff the Killer?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender DAD.





New years resolution"
ySy8mcceTno,"only about 7 years late to the slender man trend, but the 3 AM youtube channels will get a kick outta this!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Just because it may be late, doesn't mean it won't be worth watching.  That's like saying fidget spinner aren't fun because they are a dead meme.  So what it's a few years late, it's still something that thousands, if not millions of people have been obsessing about for years.  It's still something that can be good."
ySy8mcceTno,Well it’s about time about 6 years of scare and we finally get it
ySy8mcceTno,Yasss queen
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they make a ticci toby movie
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Slender Man will barely be in the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Nostalgia hits me~
ySy8mcceTno,Gangnam style
ySy8mcceTno,Dark souls would be better
ySy8mcceTno,Ur a few years too late guys
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it not fake and it good trailer movie
ySy8mcceTno,y as I lo predijo dross 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty dope
ySy8mcceTno,It ends with the girl being sacrificed to Slender Man by her crazy classmate.
ySy8mcceTno,It sucks
ySy8mcceTno,"It's about dam time,.. only took what? five years?"
ySy8mcceTno,That movie looks shitty
ySy8mcceTno,Gets me in the mood to stab someone
ySy8mcceTno,Papu
ySy8mcceTno,Terrible
ySy8mcceTno,Not too bad just need to focus on his presence the most because he is more of a how did he do that character
ySy8mcceTno,Question: I've only seen slender man twice in the movie... Does this movie actually involve the character popping up more?
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look that good
ySy8mcceTno,The middle school memories... Yeah I'll pass.
ySy8mcceTno,The fuzz
ySy8mcceTno,Thumbs up if you’re not going to support something this stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Oof
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is a long dead pasta.
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years too late, also this looks garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,I've seen fan-made trailers better than this. At least the one's I've seen were relevant for the time as well! Wtf Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,It sucks
ySy8mcceTno,Amazing
ySy8mcceTno,"do like tommy waisou "" don't think about it"""
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry guys you are like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,It alot less scary without the sounds
ySy8mcceTno,Bro i've been waiting for this for years for real
ySy8mcceTno,"No Video Game based movie is good (No one), specially when it is based on a horror game, just see how Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Ao Oni turned up."
ySy8mcceTno,Why now?
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypastas are getting movies.
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmm...
ySy8mcceTno,Meh kinda lame
ySy8mcceTno,"It's too late Sony, I'm not a edgy teen anymore"
ySy8mcceTno,i wanna see the proxies XD
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to stab my friend 12 times
ySy8mcceTno,"boooo... Look I don't care how dated slender man is, I was pumped to see this, but this is so bad it's like it was on purpose. woods, staticky music, maggots, needles, dolls, shadows, scribbling, sad screaming pale children, and top it all off with a green/blue filter and you've got the most cliche horror movie ever..

edit: how could I miss frantic door knob turning"
ySy8mcceTno,I think it's a couple years too late...But the cinematography looks great :)
ySy8mcceTno,¿¿¿Usarán loquendo???
ySy8mcceTno,Like 6years late
ySy8mcceTno,"1:55 is that the ""its wednesday my dudes""?"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,Maggotman - 2018
ySy8mcceTno,"Was this shot on 8mm VHS?  Man, this story is OLD!"
ySy8mcceTno,Eh
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, Sony, Sony. Have you guys been in cryo-stasis for 6 years and just now learned about this urban legend?"
ySy8mcceTno,Great kids show sony
ySy8mcceTno,This real ?
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to 2012! How can we help you?
ySy8mcceTno,2018 in a bustnutshell
ySy8mcceTno,Who here ia excited
ySy8mcceTno,Dont screw this up
ySy8mcceTno,Хуй
ySy8mcceTno,Wow..where the coat man?
ySy8mcceTno,Why are you running
ySy8mcceTno,So 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like Sony is running out of ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,"Cliche crying, screams, blood, gore, etc





It’s 2018 and Sony already ruined everything in it"
ySy8mcceTno,How come when they make a horror movie based on a scary person or creature it’s really never in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Love my horror movies but when you’re making a movie about something that started as a Creepypasta meme... I’ll pass
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer 100% deserved a movie before slender
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this about these to girls who killed their friend to become a ""proxy"" or something?"
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,Autisim in it's purest form right here
ySy8mcceTno,Why is he made of dark tentacles he is a white no face man in a suit
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm a bit disappointed by the trailer but I hope the film will be better. Maybe the future trailers, closer to May when it's coming out, will make me and my friends more hype. Despite this being trending in 2012 this was a significant part of my childhood and I'd like to AT LEAST give it a chance."
ySy8mcceTno,When they don’t so senpai
ySy8mcceTno,THIS MAKES NO SENCE WHERE IS SLENDER MAN HE IS NOT VIRUS
ySy8mcceTno,"If Sony Doesnt rely on jumpscares and relies more on the uneasiness and tension built ups in music and sounds, then maybe we can expect a scary movie, with one or two jumpscares, Slender is a Stalker character, not a rabid monster or Hunter."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow only 6 years late!
ySy8mcceTno,Sony..........you okay bro?.....You seem to be abit off.....
ySy8mcceTno,Hi guys I'm sorry I dident make a new videos this Week but I will don't worry viewers I will make new videos bye😉
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like every scary movie from the last 10 years.
ySy8mcceTno,I give the trailer a 4/10
ySy8mcceTno,"May I ask, like …why?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'd rather see a gritty adaptation of Candyland, starring Johnny Depp as the Candycane Lumberjack and Jeremy Irons as Lord Licorice, than this piece of crap."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man has always been my favourite creature of the web, so I'm definitely going to see this! Hope it end up being good, because the trailer makes it seem pretty decent, honestly <3"
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it said spider man trailer
ySy8mcceTno,This is either going to be good or really bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"If a Slender Man movie is confirmed to happen


Then where the hell is the FNAF movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,The Creepypasta character has came to life Across the Nation
ySy8mcceTno,The other one that came in at about 2015-2016-ish is FAR more better than this crap.
ySy8mcceTno,"*Sees this in recommended*
Oh shoot"
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems more of a comedy more than anything else, doesnt look scary at all"
ySy8mcceTno,my friend told me he though one of the parts was a bit scary im kinda scared now ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all gotta stop
ySy8mcceTno,Ummmm.......2013 is over you know
ySy8mcceTno,No tengo muchas esperanzas después de the emonji movie Sony ...
ySy8mcceTno,This should be based of the girl who was stabbed 19 times by her friends because they worshipped slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,Your worst nightmare as a kid comes to life.
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone explain this to me?
ySy8mcceTno,Was this recorded in the Japanese Suicide forest? I wonder is Logan Paul is in this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Really creepypasta movies now?
ySy8mcceTno,noo help nooo need porn
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,I didnt think they would make a movie
ySy8mcceTno,And i was scared of a drawing
ySy8mcceTno,And It all started from one photoshop contest...
ySy8mcceTno,When you upload your trailer on internet explorer
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the Killer has a better storyline
ySy8mcceTno,No doubt Sony’s really trying everything to redeem themselves
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, now we know that Dear David will get a movie in 2025, thanks hollywood"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:34 
Wow, so edgy guys, she killed herself."
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul is Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,How is there more likes than dislikes!?!
ySy8mcceTno,CAGUENLA Y LOS MATO...
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think this looks bad actually (it probably will be tho) in my opinion it's all about how the slender man himself is handled we need to see very little of him less is more when it comes to horror
ySy8mcceTno,Oh cool! I’d totally watch this!
ySy8mcceTno,*S N O R T*
ySy8mcceTno,Do u know dae way?
ySy8mcceTno,Waited to long
ySy8mcceTno,"""I wonder how they'll ruin this..."""

ySy8mcceTno,Are you serious? I want to know the answer.
ySy8mcceTno,"LOL did Tim and Eric make this?
This funny"
ySy8mcceTno,i wonder how the audio sounds when the movie comes out
ySy8mcceTno,:u

ySy8mcceTno,even though this is like 6 years late i am still hyped to see it!
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, no thanks. Bye"
ySy8mcceTno,Latinos reportense!!!😎😎😎
ySy8mcceTno,"1:38 if you keep looking at the far left hand side of the screen, you can see the width of the tree change later in that same scene you can see that that is slendy"
ySy8mcceTno,"Что за хуйня, можно спросить?"
ySy8mcceTno,This ship has sailed so long ago it's halfway across the world by now.
ySy8mcceTno,El mas grande esta devuelta.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie's gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,I’m pretty sure this movie is about having mental illnesses.
ySy8mcceTno,The whole Slender Man things is over. Should have made this in 2012 my dudes. But I might go see it...doesn't look to scary though sadly.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony making movies about a 10 year old trend. This means we're gonna see Getting over it: The Movie somewhere around 2028. Way to be behind the times, Sony! *clapclap*"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks... just awful
ySy8mcceTno,Ça ressemble à the ring
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm kinda upset,  Slenderman is acutlly pale white, not a shadowy figure and he teleports not go through walls, and did they forgot about his tectecles ?"
ySy8mcceTno,All my life i was waiting this i could not ask for more ;)
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"mmmmm con el trailer se ve que serauna pelicula muy mala ,seguro una pelicula que no tiene nada que ver con slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,"What's sad is there have been kids that have attempted to kill other kids over this creepypasta, and this is gonna make it worse."
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is a little out of style. Too late my dudes..
ySy8mcceTno,"hey sony pictures,  do you use internet explorer?, because you are 6 years later"
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone else expecting a guy with no face in a suit, stalking little kids?"
ySy8mcceTno,Get a job dude seriously
ySy8mcceTno,Llegaste tarde... 15 años tarde
ySy8mcceTno,Edgy
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, is Sony even trying anymore?"
ySy8mcceTno,Hm. Some disturbing imagery ala Samara but I don't get any feel for the movie other than another teen slasher. It'll be a wait and see for me.
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,can’t wait to see this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,because we needed this
ySy8mcceTno,2012 past me would be wheezing if i saw this
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called it wants slenderman back
ySy8mcceTno,GAY ASSFFFF
ySy8mcceTno,Is this really happening lol?
ySy8mcceTno,Los de loquendo dan más miedo
ySy8mcceTno,well at least for me this reminds me of  stranger things but like a darker version
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,It almost feels like a copy of the Ring's trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,ive seen better slender man trailers that were fan made!
ySy8mcceTno,Esperé desde el 2012 por esto. xd
ySy8mcceTno,At least it won’t be as bad as The Snowman
ySy8mcceTno,"Not gonna be as good as the emoji movie, then again nothing is better then the emoji movie"
ySy8mcceTno,gee you just gotta find the notes then its over
ySy8mcceTno,I didnt even see slender
ySy8mcceTno,https://goo.gl/adHjbm
ySy8mcceTno,"Então, Sony. Não vai dar certo."
ySy8mcceTno,I am both delighted and horrified to find that shitposting has been influencial enough on our culture to warrant a feature film.
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice movie, but I won't watch it, the trailer showed everything"
ySy8mcceTno,Terrible trailer
ySy8mcceTno,REALLY? .... i say: NOPE... is not 2011 :'v
ySy8mcceTno,Im not too sure how I feel about this... I really hope the movie is better than the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Bring back the slender man Gangnam style!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony? Y is Sony making this, Blumhouse hello??"
ySy8mcceTno,*god has left the server
ySy8mcceTno,отака хуйня малята.
ySy8mcceTno,the scariest part of this: my creepypasta phase is ready to come back
ySy8mcceTno,"Too late! Should’ve got on making this movie when we actually cared about it. I feel movie company’s these days actually WAIT until we’ve gotten over an IP or a fun idea until they make a movie out of it.. what’s next, an scp movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm going to watch this and it's this kind of movie that make me piss my pants
ySy8mcceTno,The movie should've just been some random dude looking for pieces of paper in the woods for 2 hours while over-reacting to every little noise he hears.
ySy8mcceTno,"*It´s* *time* *for* *Thomas* *to* *leave.*
*He* *has* *seen* *everything*"
ySy8mcceTno,AL FIN!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,#ILoveSony
ySy8mcceTno,"Also, we already got a Slender Man movie, it was called Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Kids better not kill other kids because of this, oh wait, this type of thing did happen when the Child’s Play movies came out! 😨"
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabron y te mato
ySy8mcceTno,Some scenes look like the documentary that Erin showed at Halloween Party(The Office Season 8).
ySy8mcceTno,This is both late and looks far off the original story of the slenderman.Dont think i will be watching this
ySy8mcceTno,YAY! NOW KIDS WILL STAB THEIR FRIENDS BECAUSE OF A MOVIE! Yes
ySy8mcceTno,Vei esse filme vai ser foda pa caralho se loco
ySy8mcceTno,"Fun twist: slenderman dont actually kidnap kids, he took them with him if he knows the child is suffering in their home (abuse, etc)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Man this brings back the dark times, oof when everyone on roblox feared slender man XD"
ySy8mcceTno,You  are about 7 years late guys
ySy8mcceTno,"First of all: I really hope they don't use the real story of the kids who attacked their friends because of Slenderman as the basis for the movie, because that's messed up and insensitive. Second: I'd be more interested in this movie if this trailer told me ANY of the plot. I have no idea what this movie is about, the fact that Slenderman is in it doesn't mean anything to me."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow 2013 incoming
ySy8mcceTno,:0
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn’t look that good, I think if they made this with a good story kinda like I.T the it would be an amazing film"
ySy8mcceTno,this looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony is really scraping the bottom of the barrel, aren't they?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy my bae
ySy8mcceTno,Ya espero verla y que lo comente loquendo :0
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks alright, as long as its not as bad as the game and slender man is a physical entity, im sold"
ySy8mcceTno,I well see that
ySy8mcceTno,Aw it doesn't have the game sound effect...
ySy8mcceTno,mmm no me convense
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,Where was this movie like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,*What if slender was a homosexual all along ;/*
ySy8mcceTno,Ehhh Idk... Doesn't look good...
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala y te mato @Sony Pictures Entertaiment
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah if it was 2012 this would be cool
ySy8mcceTno,"Nah, skip this crap movie. The game is probably much better. The same thing happened to the Silent Hill movies. They weren't soo good either, but most of the game were Great."
ySy8mcceTno,"And more importantly, did you get Marble Hornets' permission?"
ySy8mcceTno,How are they going to mess this up?
ySy8mcceTno,you know if this was about the two girls that tried to sacrifice a girl to slenderman that actually happened in real life it would be interesting
ySy8mcceTno,Absolutely not lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Falta una película de Jeff The Killer xdxdxd :v 
O.... no se si hay, lo que no creo xdxd :v"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao the girl writing on the walls and screaming in the bed look exactly like Halloween 5
ySy8mcceTno,fail
ySy8mcceTno,Looks kinda dumb. Hard to make a movie out of a video game with no context.
ySy8mcceTno,Sympathy for Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,You missed the boat on this
ySy8mcceTno,Espero no la Cagen :v
ySy8mcceTno,WHY ISNT MARKIPLIER IN THE MOVIE...MARK IS SLENDERS TRUE RIVAL
ySy8mcceTno,"You're a little late there, I'm already out of that phase"
ySy8mcceTno,Porrrrfin
ySy8mcceTno,"Thought this was a joke, but then I remembered Sony made a movie about talking Emojis"
ySy8mcceTno,Gotta say... Bit late....
ySy8mcceTno,ZzzzzZhueva
ySy8mcceTno,This outta be good
ySy8mcceTno,"I always wanted a movie with slender man, I really like this character and I hipe it will be an amazing movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Idk man people are hating on this movie too much and it's not even out yet like chill lol I'm interested in seeing it even if it's not scary XD you can't please anybody anymore
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems a little insensitive, I'm from Waukesha where the girls who stabbed their friend are from. What if this causes another attack?"
ySy8mcceTno,Yay The inflatable tube man
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the gangnam style movie
ySy8mcceTno,hope its better than insidious 😒
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes! Finally a movie that look so good as ""The Room"" was!

*You're a Lion Lisa, ah didnt hitchu!*"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALY!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no
ySy8mcceTno,This only happened 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Cooming soon ... 2025 slenderman trailer 2  releases. 2030 finally
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called they want their meme back
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna suck a lot so ya
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a shitty version of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This is probably the stupidest trailer I have ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,Now they decide to make a movie
ySy8mcceTno,🕵️‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,Stop just stop the creepy pasta is dead ugh.
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim no?
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Is any of this trailer even accurate to the slender man lore?
ySy8mcceTno,"So we really about to release a movie about a meme 342 years after the fact?

t.nigga from 2360"
ySy8mcceTno,Good game
ySy8mcceTno,Any movie that is trying to push a hash tag is always terrible
ySy8mcceTno,I AM GONNA TO GET 8 PAPERSSS
ySy8mcceTno,"You know I'm kinda happy to see an actual slender man movie, but the trailer just didn't do it for me."
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be worst then the last knight
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this is gonna be one of those movies where slender man doesn't appear until the very end of the movie and he has only 2 minutes of screen time.
ySy8mcceTno,"La sacaron tarde, eso murió en el 2015"
ySy8mcceTno,trying too hard to make it look scary
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this movie allowed to be shown after all the things that have happened with kids killing each other because of this
ySy8mcceTno,"I have a feeling they'll kill him at the end. Truth Fully. .-.
I'm not excited at all for this movie. 
Nothing scary about it.
Just sketchy as hell scenes, like Jesus."
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the Llamas with Hats movie. Oh and don’t forget about Salad Fingers in 2027...
ySy8mcceTno,"Дык это ж Контролёр обычный, чего орать-то?!)))"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is real its realised by sony
ySy8mcceTno,Is dis da queen
ySy8mcceTno,it accually seems interesting
ySy8mcceTno,"So this had better be at least as good as Marble Hornets or EverymanHybrid, other wise this is going to be a bit of a waste of time"
ySy8mcceTno,"Plot twist:
The watermelon is the killer"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this looks scary gonna watch it good job Sony
ySy8mcceTno,This is sure going to be a rip-off
ySy8mcceTno,"""Poopoo Peepee Man"" (2018) coming soon..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man doesn't work as a scary movie because we've all heard stories about him. It's a spooky creepypasta meant to scare children at campfire. 
This would've been a great movie back in 2013, but right now is too late. Also, the game is creepy because it puts you into the 1st person place. The movie just tells the story and that alone is not enough, in my opinion :/ 
I'll watch it because I hope I'm wrong."
ySy8mcceTno,"*Funny my friend was*  *disappointed* *about the other*
*'Slender man'* *movies*
*And we were talking about it*
*He is really pumped for*
*this one*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey Sony 2012 called



They want their creepypasta back"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this not a real fake trailer or is it not not fake
ySy8mcceTno,and the award for most cliche horror tralier of 2018 goes to slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Prefiero el Movimiento naranja nananananananana nananan
ySy8mcceTno,If this really came out it would be good
ySy8mcceTno,This should be one of the disliked videos on YouTube.  What the hell r u people doing?
ySy8mcceTno,Ketä suomest
ySy8mcceTno,s**t! i'm scare
ySy8mcceTno,se nota que va ser buena :)
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is T H I C C
ySy8mcceTno,Faineli slderman horroa movie
ySy8mcceTno,Next year jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Who bets Markiplier and Yamimash would go watch the premiere for this movie together if they could?
ySy8mcceTno,Θα γαμησει
ySy8mcceTno,Stabbin' Time...
ySy8mcceTno,y el loquendo?
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years late lol
ySy8mcceTno,"stupid movie will be! there is no terror in slender man. A stupid supernatural guy who is thin, wears a white mask, suit, have tentacles and comes to kill you. Please, just stupid people have fear of it. Even when the gamewas a hit it was stupid to have fear of it"
ySy8mcceTno,1910 times were ScaAaAaaAaAAry
ySy8mcceTno,when they have a slenderman movie im going to see it 👏👏👏👏😂😂😂👍👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,stranger things 3 ??
ySy8mcceTno,Why did i watch this?!
ySy8mcceTno,I do not have high hopes for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait until someone make a minecraft version of this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,This isnt even the story of slenderman...
ySy8mcceTno,doesn't look scary wtf
ySy8mcceTno,This story is very scary
ySy8mcceTno,Looks kind of boring
ySy8mcceTno,"SLENDER MAN, YOU WILL FLOAT TOO! (Penniwise laugh)"
ySy8mcceTno,"This....






-Is A Stranger Things Clone.   -_-"
ySy8mcceTno,dear davive para cuando sale su película también
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man < T H I C C male
ySy8mcceTno,"Еее, щещен"
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, looking forward for the Jeff the killer trilogy and the smiley jack reality show."
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this a little late??
ySy8mcceTno,xD Zanosi się na niezły paździerz
ySy8mcceTno,"So their making movies off of popular video games. Well, God save us all ,the Minecraft movies coming up."
ySy8mcceTno,WERE THE FICK IS CHARLIE THE FIRST MISSING KID
ySy8mcceTno,WAITINGGGGGGGGGGGG
ySy8mcceTno,"this doesn't look anything like marble hornets

that was such a good story come on sony atleast stick to it loosely"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't slenderman about teleporting and you should not look at this face.He kidnaps kids too.
ySy8mcceTno,Damm was hoping this was gonna be a good movie😭
ySy8mcceTno,Interesting that I decide to watch THIS of all things at 2:56am...
ySy8mcceTno,Parece que va a abusar mucho del suspenso y no le darán suficiente protagonismo a Slenderman como tal sino a sus acciones
ySy8mcceTno,Ну хуй его знает. Вроде норм а вроде и нет. Крч хуй знает что из этого выйдет
ySy8mcceTno,"so far we have horror movies based off kuchisake-onna, La llorona, and now slenderman. what's next? a kitsune? if so, I hope they stay to the original lore."
ySy8mcceTno,ı hate slenderman :D he very scary :D
ySy8mcceTno,FAIL:(
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,ga neuken
ySy8mcceTno,"The game stole this idea from this movie.


Also just kitting."
ySy8mcceTno,"""People don't just disappear"" won't you look silly on the release date, when viewer after viewer leaves the cinema?"
ySy8mcceTno,It would fit perfectly for a Bray Wyatt promo
ySy8mcceTno,This should have come out in 2011 when Slenderman was really popular but whatever I’m still semi interested in this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this ain't one of those cliché horror movies
ySy8mcceTno,"Another ""mental disease"" take on horror, although this could've looked a lot better"
ySy8mcceTno,That ain't scary man
ySy8mcceTno,"And the creepypasta fandom goes crazy.
Im a part of it."
ySy8mcceTno,They’re *KINDA* late to this party don’t you think...
ySy8mcceTno,"Hoping this isn't a ""loud noises"" horror movie the just relies on sudden loud noises to make you jump. 
Edit: just watch the trailer, call it..."
ySy8mcceTno,stop.
ySy8mcceTno,Do they speak on the whole movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"God, just kill me"
ySy8mcceTno,I am going to watch it for free on teh internet xD
ySy8mcceTno,"То яувство, когда от слендер мена в фильме только одно название"
ySy8mcceTno,見たい
ySy8mcceTno,What if they made a movie about slender man instead of making a horror movie and calling it slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Esta pelicula no se basa casi nada en el creepypasta original
ySy8mcceTno,slender without its costume is not slender just some random crappy monster
ySy8mcceTno,"Every horror cliche thrown into a trailer.

Dark forest, screaming child, possession, slow church bell sounds, child with blood around mouth, maggots, jump scares, dark basement, dark corridor with open door at the end, room with walls filled with scary horror drawings, suicide, mist, shadows, silhouettes, blood, knives...

I could go on."
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah that’s gonna be a no from me dawg.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is for sure stronger and scarier than pennywise
ySy8mcceTno,Slend rina
ySy8mcceTno,this already seems trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks boring as hell, no pun intended"
ySy8mcceTno,muita viagem e pouca história!!
ySy8mcceTno,No está tan bueno el trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"huh, seels like I'm the only one looking forward to seeing this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,I want kırk beş bitcoin
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years late eh? If you are going to make a Slender movie, at least take some lessons from TribeTwelve or EverymanHybrid, pls."
ySy8mcceTno,how about this slenderman in japanes forest to make it even scaryer
ySy8mcceTno,Why you don't do this in 2013?...Nobody cares slenderman now.
ySy8mcceTno,looks terrible and wouldOf killed them to show a glimpse of slender man with his iconic static music at the end it would of made it a a lot more better
ySy8mcceTno,SONY...................
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks more fucked up then scary
ySy8mcceTno,"Using dead meme and game character for a movie, how original."
ySy8mcceTno,Wait what
ySy8mcceTno,wow boring trailer
ySy8mcceTno,But where still waiting for another Jason movie
ySy8mcceTno,Team Slender
ySy8mcceTno,#SlenderWomenConfirmed
ySy8mcceTno,"The prequel ""Man takes slimming diet for way too long""  is a must see !!!"
ySy8mcceTno,I like the trailer but it doesn’t look very scary...
ySy8mcceTno,After this they need a fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,Porque tenho a impressão que esse filme vai ser uma merda?
ySy8mcceTno,"Plot twist: slenderman is lost in the woods

Slenderman:*captured the girl*
Slenderman: Do u know da wae?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Вовремя фильм снимают , как раз тема Слендермена становиться популярной"
ySy8mcceTno,but aren’t you supposed to find all the pieces of the paper on the game?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a real movie or is it just made up?
ySy8mcceTno,In the end Slenderman leaves because someone gave him 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,Autism
ySy8mcceTno,bro if this came out like 5 years ago it would've been a banger
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't see how this is going to work, but I hope it's good. Slender Man is what made me watch YouTube daily. I didn't even have a youtube account and watched so many slender man videos lol"
ySy8mcceTno,I like how the try to make it look like a psychological thriller when the original game was a jumpscare fest
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys, this is Sony, so don't trust this movie to be good"
ySy8mcceTno,"MY OPINIONS :

1. Bad CGI
2. The game is so old
3. Probably going to be a PG-13 film
4. It took too long to make it
5. Probably going to fail in Rotten Tomatoes
6. Made by Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer is stupid,It’s as if Avi Arda directed this,Sony,It’s not 2011,Your Tryhard Disturbing Content makes me want to Incarcarate myself."
ySy8mcceTno,These people should collect some coin and hire a witcher. This clearly looks like a fancy dressed leshy or spriggan.
ySy8mcceTno,I was expecting something..... better...
ySy8mcceTno,I'm guys don't you think you're a few years too late. This is why you don't capitalize on the internet trying to go by too fast but I'll look next time Sony. :/
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys, It's Sony who's making this movie. We all know how this is gonna end."
ySy8mcceTno,How did something as simple as a creepypasta got so popular it ended up getting a full-length feature film?
ySy8mcceTno,"Well i mean, I kinda feel like Ive already seen the movie with this trailer, but it's what we asked for when Slenderman was still big ey? Though from what ive seen so far, they mighta butchered it :| will still probably see it, though expectations are low"
ySy8mcceTno,God sony stop making movies
ySy8mcceTno,Can anyone tell me why this is gonna be terrible?
ySy8mcceTno,Even slender man would be like 'wtf was that. I got a reputation man' 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"why make a movie, when he game died four years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,i wonder if they got the rights from marblehornets? does anyone else remember that guy and that series? i'm pretty sure 90% of the people who know slenderman don't know marblehornets.
ySy8mcceTno,"it looks more more gore than anything...
kinda tired to see horror movies resort to gore when they don't manage to be scary... does anyone else feel the same?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ну, я надеюсь, что это будет лучше чем параша 2014 года."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow i think they are alittle  bit late
ySy8mcceTno,"The color looks awful, why can’t you put more light so I can see what is going on!"
ySy8mcceTno,"make a minecraft ender man movie on 2019
plz=D"
ySy8mcceTno,Why so much hate? Like we all didnt enjoy playing this game once upon a time
ySy8mcceTno,it looks terrible!
ySy8mcceTno,its like a comic
ySy8mcceTno,Is this only me when i see all of this i think about way back when everyone watched pewdiepie and all this real slender man in Woods videos and those pitures Im getting the chilla just thinking of all that and everything is in this movie. This is gonna be a shoutdown
ySy8mcceTno,Thomas and friends was scarier
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,"Im a big brave dog
im a big brave dog
Im a big brace dog"
ySy8mcceTno,"I originally clicked on this trailer because I wanted to laugh at how ridiculous this film concept is but honestly, all this is is a corporate cash-in on a dead internet horror story. Someone kill me"
ySy8mcceTno,"“It gets in your head, like a virus!” Yes bruddas dis is de wey to describe the Ugandan Knuckles meme!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yay, can sony do Slenderina"
ySy8mcceTno,"This has a trailer before FNAF. Huh. Not necessarily complaining, but might wanna hurry, Scott."
ySy8mcceTno,i cant saw  slenderman ughh }:(

ySy8mcceTno,This isn't 2012 Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer looks good. Hope the movie's good.
ySy8mcceTno,And next will be jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,The timing of this movie is just so....odd. I remember my friend telling me about Slender Man when we were in high school.  This was about six years ago. Why make this movie now? Which creepypasta fan decided that this needed to be done?
ySy8mcceTno,"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
ySy8mcceTno,espero que no cagen a esa creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,"this video like 
you laugh you lose 😂😂😂"
ySy8mcceTno,"""OOOHHHHH NNNOOOOOOOO!!!!!"""
ySy8mcceTno,scary trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Кллааааас, в предвкушении стоящего фильма!"
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t know why but I would watch
ySy8mcceTno,Well this...just looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,Y para cuando los Slendytubbies?
ySy8mcceTno,5  years too late?
ySy8mcceTno,"White girls looking nervous and/or screaming ☑
Obnoxious metallic grinding and/or screecnhing noises ☑
Shitty stutter editing ☑
Gray and teal filter ☑

Yup, it's a modern horror trailer alright. Bonus points for being based on a meme from half a decade ago, I guess."
ySy8mcceTno,That girl at the end looks like she just got raped smh
ySy8mcceTno,Muy tarde... 15 años tarde JPG. :v
ySy8mcceTno,Why am I watching this at night and I love creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,These dudes hit upload back in 2012 but it took so long cuz of all the other shitty movies uploading at once😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"I see alought of likes I won’t ask





GIVE ME LIKES"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah, the second meme of 2018 has arrived."
ySy8mcceTno,REALLYYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,I would be surprised if no one gets stabbed 19 times in this film
ySy8mcceTno,Hey 2012 was 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Whelp I'm not sleeping tonight 😑
ySy8mcceTno,All fucking late but is it really to late?....
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this is Spider-Man movie sorry
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine every time he’s in the camera shot the fucking tv just goes static lol
ySy8mcceTno,Stop that
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the graphics are amazing for them have us waiting 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,And....jeff the killer? :n
ySy8mcceTno,MarbleHornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,Lil late
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji movie now slender wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff The Killer the movie please
ySy8mcceTno,Wow....... So scary? 10/10? Good movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"“Can you see him?”
Me: no XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman FINALLY HAS A MOVIE ! WOO ! GO SLENDERMAN !
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years ago called, they want their shitpost back"
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell did I just watch?
ySy8mcceTno,Soo... it’s literally literally stranger things with a switch gender main character and a slender instead of demogorgan? Okay.
ySy8mcceTno,7 Y E A R S T O O L A T E
ySy8mcceTno,Ay?
ySy8mcceTno,A decade late sony  and no need to mention this is nothing like the slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,I actually thought this was just some parody until i read the channel name..
ySy8mcceTno,Well Sony ran out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone looking for the BenDrowned.exe movie? No? Just me? Aaaah... Well, time to round up the creepypasta then!"
ySy8mcceTno,AKINATOR the movie 2023
ySy8mcceTno,NOOOO ITS GONNA BE LIKE THE RING!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"fake, OK SI"
ySy8mcceTno,Plzzz dont ruin this movie
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late lol
ySy8mcceTno,"¿Cual será el gusto de hacer este tipo de peliculas? Parece que hay cero creatividad ultimamente en está industria, solo remake y adaptaciones pesimas."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really good. I’m excited to see this and have it replace my memory of the Marble Hornets inspired movie that was complete garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man way better in the game .. but I don’t think that it will be good in a movie too ✋🏻
ySy8mcceTno,Seems forced and pretty lame tbh
ySy8mcceTno,This movie will be memed into oblivion.
ySy8mcceTno,So Slender Man can get a movie but I can't?
ySy8mcceTno,And sally? :v
ySy8mcceTno,10 años tarde nada mas! cool
ySy8mcceTno,How disappointing
ySy8mcceTno,It barley shows Slender Man!
ySy8mcceTno,If the whole movie is about slender man then why is he barley showed in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I like this trailer, it doesn't give away much. Y'all used to seeing the whole movie in the trailer that's y yu Don dig this"
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the 11 drunk guys in this movie (Anyone get it?) XD
ySy8mcceTno,A dead creepypasta the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Rawr XD
ySy8mcceTno,I think the youtube movie comes next
ySy8mcceTno,"Cant wait Sony, it should be an epic movie but make it as original as possible cant wait :)"
ySy8mcceTno,They ruined creepypastas for me
ySy8mcceTno,Coming 2018: Overly Attached Girlfriend
ySy8mcceTno,Definitely want to see this
ySy8mcceTno,"La cagas, te mato"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slendy tubbies THE MOVIE
COMING SOON...

Oh no... pls no!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus, I hope the movie is not going to be as bad as this trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,Pennywise vs slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"If this were produced by ANY OTHER STUDIO, I'd be pretty excited. But Jesus Christ, we all know how this is gonna turn out. Video game movies are never good anyways, and this one's made by the studio that made the Emoji Movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres the slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,"why not man it isnt the emoji movie 

we might as well give it a shot even though its from 2012 it might actually be good"
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else kinda feel like this movie is riding on the Stranger thing hype a little or is it just me?
ySy8mcceTno,Nuestros sueños se hicieron realidad.
ySy8mcceTno,Where is slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,wow.
ySy8mcceTno,I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAVE THAT!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Quero ver o Zé graça vendo esse vídeo kkkkkk
ySy8mcceTno,COOL
ySy8mcceTno,Next a FNAF movie or a Roblox one
ySy8mcceTno,Slender was a game made for a competition n it has it's own movie now 🤦🏽‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't know he made noise. I thought he just Fritz out cameras and stole kidneys.
ySy8mcceTno,I expect to see slender aleast at some point not just boring screams
ySy8mcceTno,dab movie coming 2025
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora si se viene lo shidori
ySy8mcceTno,Now I'm ready to see a five nights at Freddy's movie trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay do i need to list why this will probably bomb? 
1. it's almost a decade too late
2. it doesn't stand a chance unless it goes all the way to R, or it will suffer the pg13 curse of horror
3. Too much focus on things that arent slender man himself 
4. Slenderman is supposed to be a slow, silent approacher, if he isn't lurking in a few background shots when you aren't paying attention it won't work
5. Really, a girl just stabs her eye with a scalpel in class on purpose? 6. are we supposed to believe the girl is possessed at the end of the trailer like the chick from the slenderman arrival game?
7. Sony Pictures"
ySy8mcceTno,"...and in 2 or 3 years well be seeing a trailer for ""Five Nights At Freddy's: The Movie""."
ySy8mcceTno,Logan makes a cameo i bet
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all real life are bringin nightmares from 2012 because u need a a movie to produce..... that's not funny ho my 11 year old self was not fuckin with it then and I'm not now: dismissed
ySy8mcceTno,Ew.
ySy8mcceTno,This is not a good meme
ySy8mcceTno,I didnt want to sleep anyways....
ySy8mcceTno,Who the fucc cares
ySy8mcceTno,Kgala kbron y t mato >:v ( espero que este buena )
ySy8mcceTno,"Ohhh gosh, this movie's gives me a goosebumps."
ySy8mcceTno,y'all done messed it up.
ySy8mcceTno,its about time...
ySy8mcceTno,"there are a few reasons I think this movie could be good, first reason is that it doesn't have a set story it has to follow unlike with a lot of game movies where you had to work off of the original story which is most of the reason game movies fail, the second reason is it's a horror movie to be honest it's hard to get horror wrong and they have probably access t millions of dollars which should give everything a good atmosphere."
ySy8mcceTno,This is finally happening well then in 20 more years all Creepypasta fanfics are going to have their own anime movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Una película de slenderman donde sale hasta al final. Típica película de terror plagada de jumpsacare y escenas donde nunca sale totalmente la criatura, hasta el final!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,😱😱😱😲😲😵😵😵😵😵😵
ySy8mcceTno,I love memes
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets was better
ySy8mcceTno,WTFFFFFFF
ySy8mcceTno,Yeeeaaahhh....NO!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Oooooooooooo yasss hunty ☕️

ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for the jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok I'm really getting sick and tired of this trailer of the trailer before the trailer garbage. I'M ALREADY WATCHING THE VIDEO FOR THE TRAILER I DON'T NEED A TRAILER FOR THE THING I'M ABOUT TO WATCH BEFORE I WATCH IT! Serious stop this crap. How annoying would it be if when you went to see a movie in theaters they just quickly gave you a summary of the entire movie and then were like ""Ok now here's the movie we just got done spoiling for you we hope you enjoy!""?"
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmmm well I wonder if the creator of Slenderman is gonna any credit...IF HES NOT DEAD BY NOW...jezz it took them for ever to make this it better be good
ySy8mcceTno,This could have been good but they just had to go on and f it up
ySy8mcceTno,That was a good trailer. GREAT JOB SONY!!
ySy8mcceTno,Harto tarde salio...

ySy8mcceTno,Finally jeez this took a very long time
ySy8mcceTno,"oh i hueta better play the ""the arrival"""
ySy8mcceTno,Han pasado 6 años...
ySy8mcceTno,"I dont know, this is late and I honestly think this looks cliche."
ySy8mcceTno,a game to a movie
ySy8mcceTno,If only it was 2012. Wait... *It isn't 2012?* 0_0?!?
ySy8mcceTno,I needed this in my life
ySy8mcceTno,Who’s hiding in the comments I am like if u are😂
ySy8mcceTno,Emojis and next slenderman? Whats next??? The Mario's movie?
ySy8mcceTno,este trailer es real???
ySy8mcceTno,Pass
ySy8mcceTno,We've been waiting. . .
ySy8mcceTno,parece mas otra pelicula de anabelle que de slender :l
ySy8mcceTno,About time they make a movie about Slendy.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should have come out 2014
ySy8mcceTno,Would have been better if it was about those two batshit crazy girls who almost killed their friend.
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, at least they're trying to actually make him scary again..."
ySy8mcceTno,Wait so is this really gonna be a real movie or did I get clickbaited?🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Does anybody own Slenderman? Like the original creepypasta writer?
ySy8mcceTno,CAN'T WAIT FOR RESIDENT EVIL 7- I MEAN SLENDER OF COURSE!
ySy8mcceTno,This is genuinely not scary?? Like I get the game might've been creepy but this is just..
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer is nothing but cheap thrills and only 1% Slender Man.
I will watch it, but I definitely won't be looking forward to it.
If they start doing a Jeff the Killer movie, then it will definitely suck."
ySy8mcceTno,Spoopy
ySy8mcceTno,Omg.....come on...over 5 years and you still can't make a good movie. That looked lame.
ySy8mcceTno,Algún latino??😂
ySy8mcceTno,Algún latino??😂
ySy8mcceTno,Couple of years late my guys..... should have invested on an scp movie...
ySy8mcceTno,All that over twenty dollars....
ySy8mcceTno,I’m wondering if the person who edited and actually created slender man for the photoshop contest ever got credit..
ySy8mcceTno,what why now
ySy8mcceTno,"This is so clichéd, it's painful."
ySy8mcceTno,You've think that just Zamasu can go to the Future? You're wrong My Friend
ySy8mcceTno,This a 2 hour movie orrrrr?
ySy8mcceTno,- _ -
ySy8mcceTno,*sigh* My first ever pewdiepie video. The good old days
ySy8mcceTno,Espera que?
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone hyped... 1 week later. Movie cancelled were making The Emoji Move 2.
ySy8mcceTno,People saying how late this movie is and how irrelevant he is still gonna go see it and still gonna prob like it like shutup with that edgy crap and enjoy the fact that we finaly got an official slendy movie 🙄
ySy8mcceTno,It is just like it
ySy8mcceTno,"Too late, fangirls already made creepypastas lame."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like The Ring!!! I didn´t like it.
ySy8mcceTno,"A little late, but hey, if it’s good, then better late then bad!"
ySy8mcceTno,Dont missed it!!! In 10 years more you can see the blue whale game on cinemas directly from sony pictures.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Why watch this if you can play the game?
ySy8mcceTno,man i cant wait for the edgy 6th graders to get a hold of this one...
ySy8mcceTno,How is this a slender Man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,How can this be a slender man movie without a SLENDER MAN !!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy why your my bro wow im telling night NIIIIIGHT
ySy8mcceTno,God Left.
ySy8mcceTno,IDC what everyone else says. I wanna see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,I hope thay add masky toby and hoodie
ySy8mcceTno,I am so lost it feels like it cut parts of it then put them in random order
ySy8mcceTno,I wish the actors were children.
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks kinda lame, which is exactly what I'd expect from a 6 years old late exploitable fenomena"
ySy8mcceTno,"bet it's going to be a jumpscared filled mess losely based on the slenderman lore claiming to be a psycological horror, just watch marble hornets instead."
ySy8mcceTno,Y el loquendo? Donde esta el Loquendo?
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmmm. A bit too late. Will still see it though even if the horror is gonna suck, who knows maybe it will surprise me."
ySy8mcceTno,4 years later
ySy8mcceTno,This is sooo 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Well Sony you got another idea and I’ve been waiting
ySy8mcceTno,I'v been waiting for this moment......Hehehehe
ySy8mcceTno,Too late
ySy8mcceTno,thanks for telling us literally nothing about the plot
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,this is like 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,WHENS IT COMING OUT!?!? I REALLY WANT TO SEE IT SO BAD 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp, this looks terrible"
ySy8mcceTno,How about finishing the Millennium Trilogy by Steig Larsson? Instead of this crap. You website sucks also.
ySy8mcceTno,kha carajos
ySy8mcceTno,"I will see this one but i will say already that i think the one that was free to watch(forgot the name of the movie) was good enough and i don't think this one will be better, for one reason



The free one was made by fans and founded by fans and it was based on the little lore we know about him, without changing anything

This one is made by an actual studio and they are probably gonna change a bunch of things, that could make it really good, i agree, but, you know, maybe not


And now we wait...."
ySy8mcceTno,"No, Sony absolutely will not ruin Slender Man for me :\ Not amused."
ySy8mcceTno,2:50 😓
ySy8mcceTno,YES FINALLY!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Scary
ySy8mcceTno,28k dislikes - what an amazing start for a terrible based on creepy pasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,I understand this movie should’ve came out in like 2013 but I’m give this movie the benefit of the doubt and say it has good potential.
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora slendy tiene copyright YEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
ySy8mcceTno,even the trailer sucks
ySy8mcceTno,porfa lo único que pido para este año es que no las caguen
ySy8mcceTno,OK so you make a slender man movie but you completely mess it up. By all accounts slender man has a few main tropes that slender walking and slender sickness and eating young children under the age of 10 unless provoked. The slender sickness it just from the radiation that comes naturally from his body
ySy8mcceTno,O L D. M E M E
ySy8mcceTno,I forgot about slender man lol
ySy8mcceTno,Wasnt there already a movie with Slenderman stalking ppl?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it has nothing to do with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Finally slender man gets hes first movie
ySy8mcceTno,"This is duuuumb. not even remotely scary. It looks like a reboot of the Bye Bye Man, and that movie was fucking awful."
ySy8mcceTno,OMG GOTTA SEE
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala y te mato xDD
ySy8mcceTno,Rather watch marble hornets again and actually enjoy slender man than this
ySy8mcceTno,"As long as it’s scary, I’ll see it"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah Sony, a little too late there man."
ySy8mcceTno,Tomen mi dinero
ySy8mcceTno,The jump scare doesn't work when you can predict it guys. Cool idea tho.
ySy8mcceTno,2013 called...
ySy8mcceTno,Better late than never i suppose
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was a joke
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer sucks. It almost seems fan made
ySy8mcceTno,I though this was clickbait
ySy8mcceTno,Take it down
ySy8mcceTno,I have a a hunch that there's probably going to be an actual murder(s) that happens when this comes out that's linked to it ( just because of obsessed fanatics)
ySy8mcceTno,"Made by Sony, so you know it’s only being made for the money to capitalize on an outdated fad, because that purpose has never caused movies to turn into utter garbage before right?"
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it’s Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Cough cough LATE cough cough 6 years cough cough
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like if the games never happened and not many knew about the slenderman this would be a better film
ySy8mcceTno,DANNNNNMMMMMM this is gonna be a good movie cp fans get some popcorn
ySy8mcceTno,"So, is this movie going to based off of the meme-ier Slenderman, or the one associated with other creepypasta characters like Ticci Toby, or are they just watering him down to a generic demonic entity that you see in most horror movies?"
ySy8mcceTno,This has literally nothing to do with what slenderman is known for. Did you not do any research?!?
ySy8mcceTno,"Presiento que va a decepcionar, solo va a vender por el titulo."
ySy8mcceTno,Tmr no aparece slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Don't think don't say it don't think it do say it don't think don't say it
ySy8mcceTno,Is that a real trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,Awww man I can’t wait for the SILLY BANDS movie!.......
ySy8mcceTno,Well. I guess I got to wait for the Gucci gang movie
ySy8mcceTno,6 years later..
ySy8mcceTno,"I may have gone to see this.




If it came out 5 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Классно
ySy8mcceTno,Sony pictures is like that one uncle who asked you what you want for christmas 6 years ago and at sometime in January he gives a shitty version of it
ySy8mcceTno,No i can't see him a i plan to keep it that way !
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they wont screw up his appearance like everyone else did.
ySy8mcceTno,Making a movie years afters the main character loses popularity. Sony Sony Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,"No mames de un krepy pasta a una meplicula, no mames"
ySy8mcceTno,T-This is real? :')
ySy8mcceTno,"Que película más aburrida , sería mejor si hubiese Loquendo :v"
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora Falta que le Hagan una pelicula a Jeff the  Killer...
ySy8mcceTno,Late movie Upload 😂
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really bad 😬
ySy8mcceTno,Sony at their best
ySy8mcceTno,"I would love to see this. No joke. You might think it's stupid or too late. But me,I WOULD SPEND ANY MONEY TO SEE THIS"
ySy8mcceTno,Something worth watching
ySy8mcceTno,There’s literally not plot
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,The knockoff version of IT.
ySy8mcceTno,5 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Solo veo que aperece una puta vez el slenderman >:v pelicula fea muy 2012 alv
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all later than me after I miss the bus and have to walk to school
ySy8mcceTno,"When it showed the girl coming out of the forest, am I the only one who though she was like gonna have no eyes? In accordance with all that old lore “no eyes still sees” etc etc"
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this movie will be good
ySy8mcceTno,Wow they only took almost 6 years long to take this movie out
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala kbron y te mato.
ySy8mcceTno,This is late by like 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope this is gonna be good...
ySy8mcceTno,I just love germanic fairytales. I cant wait to see how this turned out
ySy8mcceTno,"Well according to creepy pasta rules. Once this movie comes out then slender man will no longer be a creepy pasta. Creepy pastas are creepy rumors and stories going around the internet believed to be true. But because slender man is now in a movie, people will no longer believe it is real. Because let’s be honest. Will the government allow anyone to make a movie about the most dangerous serial killer. So yeah... Slender man is now a horror mascot along with Jason(Friday the 13th) and Freddy cougar( nightmare on elm street)"
ySy8mcceTno,Better live up to the hype since its so late.
ySy8mcceTno,i hope that this is fake
ySy8mcceTno,This movie shouldve been made in 2013 -______-
ySy8mcceTno,"""🎶Gimme 20 dollars, gimme 20 dollars🎶"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man gon boonk gang yo kids
ySy8mcceTno,OwO
ySy8mcceTno,"Why would you cry for the movie being late?
I mean, ya, you got a point, but I guess the quality today is better than what we would have got 5-6 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,THEYRE DOING IT WRONG
ySy8mcceTno,Quien vino por haberlo visto en un momazo de puto sempai
ySy8mcceTno,That Wisconsin girl that got stabbed because of her friends believing in slender man Was my friend
ySy8mcceTno,It wont be as good without markiplier screaming
ySy8mcceTno,# hashtag
ySy8mcceTno,About 4 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Yesss
ySy8mcceTno,"Movie about slenderman nice 

*only shows up once in the entire trailer*

What da fack"
ySy8mcceTno,fue muy aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatedadora
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer next?
ySy8mcceTno,Starring Logan Paul as Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow this better be scarier then the game, i completed all of those games in a half day"
ySy8mcceTno,#isawhim
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who never believed in slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Why didn’t you come out with the movie in 2012 ? It was popular back then you goddamn Sony
ySy8mcceTno,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabron y te mato
ySy8mcceTno,first creepypasta turned into a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of stranger things but it will probably not be as good
ySy8mcceTno,HE SAW HIM WITH NO CAMERA!!!! UNCANONICALLY!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,So whats the plot?
ySy8mcceTno,I was told this was sort of about the young girl who took her friends into the woods and murdered them because of slendy. She's now in a mental hospital.
ySy8mcceTno,Dude. They just threw a little bit of shitty movies and added slender man in there. Its not even the real story :/
ySy8mcceTno,"ohhhhhh
this gonna be good"
ySy8mcceTno,y tho
ySy8mcceTno,si eres español like aguante Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,You're late Sony...10 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,Dab: The Movie 2029
ySy8mcceTno,1972
ySy8mcceTno,Definitivamente la voy a ver// ill see it
ySy8mcceTno,This is the worst fanmade slenderman trailer yet ...
ySy8mcceTno,">Hype a Slender man movie  that's way past its mass appeal.
>Only shows Slender man once and barely
Think I'll just rewatch It Follows."
ySy8mcceTno,This honestly looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it's going to be a big mess tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Es real?
ySy8mcceTno,"Of course the black girl die lol. She probably didn't have anything to do  with anything. 







P.S: jk"
ySy8mcceTno,Jeez little girl he just wants you to pay up from the 20 dollars you borrowed.
ySy8mcceTno,Es real el tráiler?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,4 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all need Jesus
ySy8mcceTno,"lo malo de cuando un trailer es muy bueno como este, la película no suele serlo...."
ySy8mcceTno,do you see slender man at all
ySy8mcceTno,#Ineedtoseethismovie
ySy8mcceTno,Guys if you're a horror movie junkie you'd notice at least three rip-offs from other classics. Make your guess at which ones those are.
ySy8mcceTno,Ya paso de moda asta haora la sacan la uvieran echo en su momento ya la cagaron
ySy8mcceTno,Nice
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,*Cagala kbron y te mato*
ySy8mcceTno,"Really, just really? Hollywood you are completely outta ideas aren't you?"
ySy8mcceTno,"EITA PORRA,SÓ VEM SLENDERMAN SÓ VEM"
ySy8mcceTno,Really?? Slenderman movie? At 2018? I mean that's not bad but it should have been created a while ago
ySy8mcceTno,How about Slendrina movie? Please make it happen! 😂
ySy8mcceTno,0:00 i already want to die
ySy8mcceTno,"mirar para abajo para que no te mate, hackeados papus >:v"
ySy8mcceTno,They are more new movies too
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus this looks worse than the emoji movie... what's next a jeff the killer movie or whatever he's called...
ySy8mcceTno,Probably why its so late is because they took alot of time and effort on the movie. Like if you think your gonna like the movie
ySy8mcceTno,:v
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this would be about the attempted murder. Lame
ySy8mcceTno,"Think they used internet Explorer when they uploaded this, thats why its 5 yrs l8 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,1996
ySy8mcceTno,Pasen la escena de la violación sin censura :v okno
ySy8mcceTno,Like si respiras:v
ySy8mcceTno,I never understood why he was just a fictional character in a video game now he's feared by kids like he's not even real
ySy8mcceTno,i'm reeeeally curious. could be good
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be so stupid that people are going to think of it as a comedy rather than a horror flick.
ySy8mcceTno,Are they trying to copy Halloween 5
ySy8mcceTno,"I beg to differ this film would follow the Slenderman Mythos or it will be good in general. Back then the whole series was a little niche thing but it has grown stale, old, corrupted etc."
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s based of the original story right 
Cause it looks like it! Watch the HBO documentary and the 2020 Edition. I say yes to this movie!"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this suppose to be Marble Hornets?
ySy8mcceTno,killer*
ySy8mcceTno,if they maded Jeff the Killers
ySy8mcceTno,Will this movie slender man Gangnam style?
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not really surprised they would make a movie like this because with the new it movie that came out a couple of months ago that brought back to the stage of of Pennywise the Clown I don't really care about it but they're like 6 years late cuz this Creepypasta was popular 6 years ago and they should have done it 6 years ago but if they do it right then they would make a great movie and slender man would become popular again like he was a couple years ago but if they fail then Victor's popular character will go down the drain to be the worst movie character of all time and if they do make a great then they will it will make the fix that well always watching a Marble Hornets story didn't this is what I think goodbye
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 No. Just no
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,Uuhhh sony AGIAN! Really.
ySy8mcceTno,"About 6 years late, sorry Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting years for this and I'm not really sure how to feel about it.

Don't get me wrong, I really love Slenderman and all the stories about him but this trailer doesn't seem right. I feel like it should be more about mysteries and disappearing children.

But we'll have to see when it comes out. I'll most likely enjoy it either way, just might not be what I was expecting."
ySy8mcceTno,Is perfect but where are the clothe of slenderman :v
ySy8mcceTno,Its gonna gonna be a fucking horribly movie because its sony 😓
ySy8mcceTno,Love how everyone thinks this is basically a meme thing. This is the actual horror story. Why are people comparing it to the Emoji Movie. This actually looks pretty decent.
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"Chaotic, nonsensical trailer. Looks very formulaic."
ySy8mcceTno,Boring. Real Life Israeli-Palestine Wars cause more damage to children than Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Boring. Real Life Israeli-Palestine Wars cause more damage to children than Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Eu vi tudo menos o slender man pqp
ySy8mcceTno,Of course we don't get to see the man up close
ySy8mcceTno,you didn't have to use a knife to erase the memory of him. just use EYE BLEACH!!!! 20% OFF!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Meh, it's possible it will end up like the Tomb Raider movie.  Slightly based off the game/story but it doesn't have much to go off of, but ended up being slightly interesting to watch."
ySy8mcceTno,Must see!
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Müslüman yokmu amk
ySy8mcceTno,Yall are 6 years late....

ySy8mcceTno,2012 is back
ySy8mcceTno,Yeeeees BUT i dont get the plot nice the used the symptoms of seeing SLENDER and its sick BUT they should show his faceless
ySy8mcceTno,Wow what a suprising way of ruining a good horror story. Thanks. I wanna die already.
ySy8mcceTno,Is the person who made slender man included in this or...
ySy8mcceTno,"Oi, i better hear ppl screaming, peeing and shitting their pants when this comes out in cinemas"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hope it's good, would probably have been a blockbuster if it came out 5 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,a lot of ideas are taken from The ring
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wow the slender man movie im so freaked out when they make it ive been waiting all the time  🗡🗡
ySy8mcceTno,omg i got soooo scared
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!!!! FINALLY!!!

ySy8mcceTno,But do they no de wae?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,"Why does it feel like I’ve seen this before... oh yeah, the entirety of 2012."

ySy8mcceTno,And where is slenderman ?
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I have to hear the door creek while watching this. Alone
ySy8mcceTno,Turkler azeriler burdami +1
ySy8mcceTno,They should at least make a Jeff the killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow look ! A Crappypasta movie !.

But why u not use real scary Creepypasta story SoNy???"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell yes
ySy8mcceTno,I doubt this will be as good as marbled hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Arkadaşlar sizler için bu kadar tehlikeye giriyorum bi like atarsanız çok güzel olur kekskspep2peldkd
ySy8mcceTno,"You guys are late this should have come out a long time ago....

ySy8mcceTno,This looks student film-ey...
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY GOD YYEEEEEEEEAAAAASSSSSSSS

ySy8mcceTno,Im scared that this might not be as great as it could be
ySy8mcceTno,Every time she used the marker I cringed it’s a mark stop smashing it! This is truly the scariest part of this film
ySy8mcceTno,Death Note Movie Two!
ySy8mcceTno,Where was this in 2013?!
ySy8mcceTno,"Ugh, great, generic background story and ignoring the games roots incoming."

ySy8mcceTno,sender man its gay
ySy8mcceTno,Woooow es toy viendo la matrix
ySy8mcceTno,mmnnn.. no se no la compro :v
ySy8mcceTno,"It doesn't look like its gonna be like the game at all. However, it could still be a good horror film. I have hopes for this one."
ySy8mcceTno,"Some later, Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,When se llama Slenderman but casi ni aparece
ySy8mcceTno,Doblada en español Loquendo.
ySy8mcceTno,"What, now? Is slender man a thing again?"

ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a dumb film
ySy8mcceTno,Solo los niños lo veran
ySy8mcceTno,This is real?!? ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,"First was Emoji Movie, now this thing... why"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,It’s old shouldnt be considered a horror movie will cause more deaths then the creepy pastas shouldn’t be a thing
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see dis!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender-man drags girl away... 
Me: she wasn't ready!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,The comments are gold
ySy8mcceTno,A meme to a movie? This looks more like a comedy than a horror movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Like si vienes por bers
ySy8mcceTno,BR SE CAGANDO ?
ySy8mcceTno,I believe its really off the original story
ySy8mcceTno,Thats dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Well we all know there late but middle schoolers were taking this myth way to seriously and two even tried to sacrifice a real human to them sooo i guess nows a good time as any. 😂👌
ySy8mcceTno,Whem is it out in the cinema
ySy8mcceTno,Likw por el estreno de la pelicula 2018
ySy8mcceTno,de los mismos creadores de deaht note la pelicula llega slenderman la pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus... I remember playing the game like 6 years ago.... so much has changed since then.
Will still watch it, just to see how good the legendary game can be in the shape of a movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real
ySy8mcceTno,I heard they are making this into a video game! Neat!
ySy8mcceTno,Category Entertaiment
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly I must be smoking something but I thought it was 2018 not 2012!!!!!!! Terrible timing and it doesn’t even look that good
ySy8mcceTno,"There's some good spooky imagery, but other than that, it looks just like every other scary movie from recent years."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks homosexual.
ySy8mcceTno,"Waiting for ""Go to sleep"""
ySy8mcceTno,I will knock him out inside one round
ySy8mcceTno,It almost tastes fanmade
ySy8mcceTno,"So barely any actual slenderman in the trailer, nice nice. -_-"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like the Ring but in the woods😒
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer was awful
ySy8mcceTno,You can’t make a slender movie without the 8 pages lol
ySy8mcceTno,Q verga es esto
ySy8mcceTno,Yigit abim oldurmustu onu
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer looks so bad not gonna lie looool
ySy8mcceTno,""" coming soon "" watch its gonna come out in 3 years 😭😭😭💀"
ySy8mcceTno,Guys u already judge it just by the trailer who knows maybe it will be good also indeed 7 years late
ySy8mcceTno,After playing all of his games... A new challenge is here
ySy8mcceTno,Wack
ySy8mcceTno,Ummmhhh..... ring???
ySy8mcceTno,Y el loquendo >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome
ySy8mcceTno,ТØП НАХØЙ
ySy8mcceTno,#Cmamo
ySy8mcceTno,Найс блять
ySy8mcceTno,At least they made it.
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks trash
ySy8mcceTno,"What a surprise! It looks awful! 6 years late, and they make him like any other shitty horror monster. If you want some quality Slenderman content, the YouTube ARGs that used to run a few years back are way better than this. Having the next chapter come out at random dates, sometimes even with months in between makes it a lot cooler and somehow believable. This on the other hand looks like an edgy video you would find on the Deep Web (posted by so-called ""Satanists"", of course) but in HD. Waste of money, waste of time, disrespectful to the original Slenderman mythos."
ySy8mcceTno,Who's scared
ySy8mcceTno,Do you kno the wae
ySy8mcceTno,Neat
ySy8mcceTno,It's late but i want to see it anyway
ySy8mcceTno,"Rly.
New slenderman movie prank again😂"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this tokyo ghoul ?
ySy8mcceTno,Зачем? Он уже не хайповый!
ySy8mcceTno,que clase de pelicula clase b copia de la llamada es esto?
ySy8mcceTno,"I was getting big chills...




From the sound of the marker on the mirror..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman the movie
Me: I only saw slenderman once
Sony: We needed a name"
ySy8mcceTno,Al salir una pelicula del 2018 haora esta pelicula es muy buena para las creepypastas  ojo esta pelicula es muy buena se llama slenderman la pelicula XD
ySy8mcceTno,Is it even possible for horror movies to be scary anymore? Ohhhhh an evil slender man in the woods possesses teenage girls...who cares...
ySy8mcceTno,2012 te llaman
ySy8mcceTno,Add found fottage aspect to it. Like in the gamew
ySy8mcceTno,Man 2010 went by fast but hello 2011!!
ySy8mcceTno,A whole bunch of people killing themselves and not one time I see slender man
ySy8mcceTno,ahhh the studio that brought us The Emoji Movie. This is gonna be great
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, and they want their creepypasta lore back"
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"Another Evil Dead rip off? Christ, if you really wanted to create intrigue, do something to make it fresh yet true to the myth. Also, stop with the CGI monsters and go back to the amazing effects of movies like The Thing(1982), The Fly and The Fly II, Friday The 13th,  Hellraiser etc. Have Slender be played by a skinny contortionist in great make up effects. Use the cgi to enhance him but not create him."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait, what is this movie even about? What’s the plot?"
ySy8mcceTno,"NO








Plz"
ySy8mcceTno,"WHY WAS THIS MADE ONLY TO MAKE MONEY FROM MY BOI SLENDY, GET OUTTA MY HOUSE"
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY GOSH ROBLOX STOP IT SLENDER 2 NEW TRAILER LOOKS COOL!
ySy8mcceTno,"from the people that brought you blockbusters like ""The Emoji Movie""!!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Too late Sony, not even fnaf will do."
ySy8mcceTno,the sound be trippin
ySy8mcceTno,"Enserio a esta falta de creatividad an llegado los estudios? En estos ultimos años solo se han pasado sacando remakes, reboots y secuelas, casi no han habido propuestas originales y ahora van a pasar otro periodo haciendo peliculas de creepypastas e historias de internet"
ySy8mcceTno,thought we left this in 2012 where it belongs
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope we get a sexual, fat man"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this lore based? Or on the girls that blamed the fictional slender man for killing their friend?
ySy8mcceTno,Dude this is a Slender Man movie and in the trailer we only see him for 3 second...
ySy8mcceTno,que foda tio krl mL ESPERO PARA FICAR PRONTO E SAIR NOS CINEMAS
ySy8mcceTno,De seguro no dará MIEEEEDO se ve que solo saldrá una pequeña escena de slenderman segurisimooooo
ySy8mcceTno,Pero Que!? Una pelicula de slenderman?? x'DD
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, so this is just my opinion. But if they make this movie later than it actually is trending it’s going to look like the hole franchise is being milked.
As if it weren’t already"
ySy8mcceTno,This is about the SLENDER SICKNESS not the actual guy I believe... the sickness is said to bring mass panic and hallucinations so this film must be inspired more by the sickness than him
ySy8mcceTno,The Forrest of NOPE...
ySy8mcceTno,Omg xD
ySy8mcceTno,*screamer **2:39*
ySy8mcceTno,"Moram da priznam da me ovo nije ni malo zainteresovalo. Los trejler. Nadajmo se da ce film biti bar malo bolji, ali cak ni onda nece biti dovoljno dobar da bih pogledao do kraja. Znam unapred. Toliko."
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this is actually interesting but stupid at the same time"
ySy8mcceTno,Is it me or this looks a lot like the ring? 🤔🤔🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Is this like Stranger Things inspired
ySy8mcceTno,So when are they gonna make a Five Nights At Freddy's movie...?
ySy8mcceTno,Que wea?
ySy8mcceTno,Шо за говно
ySy8mcceTno,Omg where are the lil rats now?
ySy8mcceTno,the game is so old and predictable that it would be a miracle if it turns out to be good
ySy8mcceTno,Bem bosta
ySy8mcceTno,isn't a slender man from that minecraft game my kids play?
ySy8mcceTno,i didint get scared

ySy8mcceTno,This took tooooooo long.
ySy8mcceTno,I'd go see that tbh
ySy8mcceTno,I would rather rewatch youtuber like Markiplier or Smosh for few minutes playing this game rather than going to the theatre to watch this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Hahahahaha
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman its coming friends :D
ySy8mcceTno,Que bosta vei.
ySy8mcceTno,Remember those days when all were afraid of him...

ySy8mcceTno,Oh where is the main slender ?
ySy8mcceTno,"No me gusto mucho,ya que no es como el de los creepypasta.

ySy8mcceTno,The move we waited so many years for
ySy8mcceTno,This is so 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Que susto mike eu acho que eu acho que nao vou conseguir mais jogar vamo sair
ySy8mcceTno,"Pelo trailer, o filme não me pareceu tão bom"
ySy8mcceTno,Why do all the horror movies coming out these days look exactly the same? Can't Hollywood do anything interesting or original anymore?

ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like an urban legend getting more and more popular!😆
ySy8mcceTno,"uhh,ok then"
ySy8mcceTno,Man this movie is going to be great
ySy8mcceTno,Норм
ySy8mcceTno,"Video: can you see him?

Me: yeah he's on the thumbnail"
ySy8mcceTno,Man this movie looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Slender?
ySy8mcceTno,Hope the movie will be alright
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is not scary enough it doesn’t give the tense from playing the game
ySy8mcceTno,2017-2018 was a year of game movies
ySy8mcceTno,Still it would seem like a good movie but why make it when there is already kids commuting suicide and murder over a story they read about him let alone a full on movie
ySy8mcceTno,This looks IMMENSELY crap
ySy8mcceTno,Hey better late than never right? XD
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I CAN'T WAIT!!!$
ySy8mcceTno,All you weebs asking for a parade of creepypasta in the movie; read the title you sheeps
ySy8mcceTno,ok ok slenderman is cool
ySy8mcceTno,ok ok slenderman is cool
ySy8mcceTno,oh no i poop in my paants! :D
ySy8mcceTno,"Yea...... You're a little late there, pal.."
ySy8mcceTno,lol just close your eyes
ySy8mcceTno,Are they seriously remaking the Bye Bye Man ALREADY?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,Finnaly
ySy8mcceTno,CLICKBAIT! Slenderman wasn't even in the trailer. at all. lmao
ySy8mcceTno,looks decent enough..when does it come out?
ySy8mcceTno,okay
ySy8mcceTno,Отлично:)))Когда смотрел сам фильм обосрался.....😎😎😔😔🤠😈👾👽👣🧠🎅🏿Жду 2 часть ::))))D
ySy8mcceTno,Fake?
ySy8mcceTno,Salad Fingers ... feat Danny Devito
ySy8mcceTno,"This has a ridicilous concept. Where are 8 pages? Where is movie version of Slender Arrival? Where is the no-town concept? I wont judge, the movie is good itself but the concepts I asked about would give it blue-purple foggy atmosphere. Not just that, but the killer (from Slender Arrival game) would chase that person which will again...(I was an idiot when I had to reset the generators in the tunnel) reset all 6 generators. Then the caves at late afternoon while there is daylight and then when the person exits. They find out that their forest is burning down in fire and Slender chases them in rage to a building. Watch the end of Slender Arrival game to know the rest lol."
ySy8mcceTno,And slendy is cute
ySy8mcceTno,So creepy I'm just 7
ySy8mcceTno,the best part is in 2:50
ySy8mcceTno,Here's Hollywood ruining things we like
ySy8mcceTno,الي جاي من عند خلف لايك
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the feedback on this XD
ySy8mcceTno,they don't kno de wae
ySy8mcceTno,they should of made this movie a lot earlier
ySy8mcceTno,How much you wanna bet slender man is barely gonna be in the actual movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Considering these are the same folks that brought the Emoji Movie, it maaaaaaaaaay not be the best idea to work on a Creepypasta meme that died out almost a decade ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Next is ROBLOX horror movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be an awful meme
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting for 5 years for this
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all know the feeling of waiting too long for something and when it finally comes you aren't interested at all. Yep Sony put it into a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Another crappy video game movie
ySy8mcceTno,Looks depressing and even for a horror movie. Nothing to hold on in this trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,i cant believe it happens
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE A SLENDERMAN MOVIE IS COMING!!!!! yaaaay
ySy8mcceTno,stupid trailer :/
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhh good old times 2012 when pewdiepie was good
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a fan made movie
ySy8mcceTno,"It's 2018 dude. 
You should make a new one called ""trump man"" 
.
.
 I mean he still creep the hell outta me😕"
ySy8mcceTno,"His not scaring no one any more,2 late"
ySy8mcceTno,"IM HYPED, LETS GOOO"
ySy8mcceTno,2:22 Ender Ma
ySy8mcceTno,Какого числа в Росие??
ySy8mcceTno,lol
ySy8mcceTno,Ooo cok gerildim
ySy8mcceTno,the marker sounds were probably the most scary thing to happen in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,At least Shrek 5 is coming in 2019
ySy8mcceTno,Where slender man lol
ySy8mcceTno,"barily?






bruh"
ySy8mcceTno,The movie who nobody asked.
ySy8mcceTno,This was uploaded using internet explorer.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks really bad. What's it even about?
ySy8mcceTno,"*2010 in the distance* _""Well where the hell have y'been????""_"
ySy8mcceTno,Next move its playerunknown battlegrounds in 2030
ySy8mcceTno,Early pewdiepie would be so proud
ySy8mcceTno,Ya existen mejores largometrajes que como se ve este solo que están muy ocultas y es dificil encontrarlos pero les aseguro que es mucho mejor de como se ve que va a estar este y a demás... Estos se apegan casi por completo a la historia original
ySy8mcceTno,This is just late
ySy8mcceTno,Nope you can't see John Cena
ySy8mcceTno,"Please cmon this its absolutely absurd, this cant be a real trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Does he know tha wey?
ySy8mcceTno,Legend is back
ySy8mcceTno,"96%: this sucks 


4%:loagon paul"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:34 I just said ""OOWWWW!!!"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Yea, not interesting anymore, 5 years late, not even hyped, they want to make fast money, thats it."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the dude who originally came up with the creepy pasta was smart enough to copyright his creation.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years after the slenderman hype😂
ySy8mcceTno,THIS LOOKS SICK
ySy8mcceTno,And the next movie is probably going to be something SCP related. SCP: The Breach.
ySy8mcceTno,"they turned a meme into a movie... it's not the first time, won't be the last"
ySy8mcceTno,Yüzünü gören cennetlik
ySy8mcceTno,Süleymandır man olmuş daha çok
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all are a little late with this aren’t you?
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh my God. Yes, they made the Emoji Movie. Yes, the Emoji Movie was horrible. Plus, this is just the teaser trailer. It's not like it's the full movie. Give it time, and watch the movie when it comes out instead of judging it right off the bat. It may not be what you find ""scary"" but we all have preferences."
ySy8mcceTno,“Slender man” proceeds to not show slender in trailer :waitwu:
ySy8mcceTno,It's only a matter of time before they make a Jeff the Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,When you let internet explorer upload your movie
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,"From a creepy pasta to an urban legend, to a movie on the bid screen!"
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Sony ain’t pinning any comments
ySy8mcceTno,I am very excited for this film
ySy8mcceTno,Dis is scare😨😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman: is an Eldritch monstrosity that eats children and drives people insane
Some of y'all: 10/10 would bang"
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only on who thinks this movie looks boring as all hell?
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for two girls one cup the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why am I watching this at 2 am
ySy8mcceTno,I think she looks like Schmitty at 01:00
ySy8mcceTno,WHERES THE STATIC AND THE CAMERA!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are 6 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,its not horrorable for me wtf dude?
ySy8mcceTno,if PewDiePie ain't in this movie I'm boycotting Sony on god
ySy8mcceTno,Is this movie based on the slender man stabbing?
ySy8mcceTno,Better late than never?
ySy8mcceTno,Alguien habla español?
ySy8mcceTno,Send this to pewdss!
ySy8mcceTno,Are we just going to pretend always watching wasn't a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yessssss....finally
ySy8mcceTno,from the creators of the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no ;_:
ySy8mcceTno,xD bArK RaWr
ySy8mcceTno,"HYPE,HYPE,HYPEEEEEEEE"
ySy8mcceTno,Those dislikes.
ySy8mcceTno,Another movie based off of a video game.
ySy8mcceTno,"ok but the people that actually first heard about slenderman from creepypasta and/or the game are like above the age of 16 now, sony pls"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't even care if this will be bad or not! I just can't wait😂
ySy8mcceTno,Вроде что-то годное.
ySy8mcceTno,"HIM 








HIM"
ySy8mcceTno,Wha
ySy8mcceTno,Yiğit alp çavdar bunu beğendi
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how much they'll rip from marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Not really adout slederman tbh it look more like....something form the ring...well sort of
ySy8mcceTno,Part two is the whole CREEPYPASTA GANG YEAH?  RIGHT?! 😲
ySy8mcceTno,"me da pena cuando mata al perro ... todo porque el actor principal esta poseido por e
slenderman .... la mejor parte es cuando se quema la casa y descubren un bunker con camaras donde ven como se quemo la casa a causa De que un señor asesina a su hija y la madre quema la casa en venganza y se va al manicomio.. al final mueren todos y..."
ySy8mcceTno,.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . ʕʘ̅͜ʘ̅ʔYASSSS
ySy8mcceTno,bored
ySy8mcceTno,Nani
ySy8mcceTno,"well they are going to ruin Slender Man, one of the coolest fiction characters of all time"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is about the Slenderman Stabbing, right? Or is it just a stupid horror movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,"wait...





okay."
ySy8mcceTno,1:52 AAYYY WHATS GOOD FAM
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks amazing, barely any slender man hopefully I get to see a bunch of people talking instead of slender man!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Can you see him??? No you can't because it's 



JOHN CENA!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Not scarry at all.....
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 I swear my phone hit the roof. Lol
ySy8mcceTno,I Dink I Found De Wey
ySy8mcceTno,"Thought was a fan trailer, they are taking this seriously.
In two years we will have Jeff the killer
Six months Ticci-Toby 
And that is how Sony started the Crepypasta-Verse"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it has nothing to do with slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,"-_- What next? Jeff the killer, Ben drowned or The proxies?"
ySy8mcceTno,???
ySy8mcceTno,u guys are like 6 years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a fan project. But made by the fans dad who doesn't really get what the game was about.
ySy8mcceTno,Imma scared
ySy8mcceTno,they would make the jeff the killer movie..
ySy8mcceTno,"only about 6 years to late, way to really take advantage of this hot trend"
ySy8mcceTno,"A: this would have been awesome in 2012
B:  most of the trailer are just girls screaming and kids going crazy
C: WHERE IS SLENDERMAN 99 PERCENT OF THE TIME
D: it’s from the same company that made the emoji movie
 It doesn’t look like the best movie ever"
ySy8mcceTno,"So the 2 girls get charged for the whole ""slenderman told me to kill them"" incident, you make 2 girls seemingly the main characters?"
ySy8mcceTno,"This would be funny, except for that bit where people have already used the video game as an excuse to murder people in real life...now it just seems kindof passé."
ySy8mcceTno,Perturbadross
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, thought he died a long time ago."
ySy8mcceTno,"Just in case any of you missed it, watch Marble Hornets. The REAL Slenderman movie/show."
ySy8mcceTno,Ahh the incredible vagueness of horror movie trailers.
ySy8mcceTno,who plays slender man on Roblox.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally the movie comes out
ySy8mcceTno,Y though
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,Why are horror movies getting less scary
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Owen Wilson
ySy8mcceTno,Did Sony even read history of slender Man I mean we only saw him once in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Welp this is going to be a bad movie I think
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is a dead meme by now this would make more sense if it was made 10 years ago or something
ySy8mcceTno,Hey look at that.  They made a movie about a 10 year old Creepy Pasta character.
ySy8mcceTno,Yawn
ySy8mcceTno,This will have nothing to do with the creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,".... this looks pretty dumb. About as generic as horror can get, what about this specifically is tailored to be about slenderman?"
ySy8mcceTno,Unfortunate
ySy8mcceTno,looks like crap looks like it is more going to be focused on physiological stuff rather than actually slender man
ySy8mcceTno,https://link.dosh.cash/YCLI/TgXNNVkNBJ
ySy8mcceTno,i love the slender man
ySy8mcceTno,-insert jeff the killer cameo at the end-
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one getting Operator vibes from this? I feel like this pertains more to the Operator from Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,"So....

  Is he John Cena?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought slender man kidnaps, people not make them commite suicide (confused emoji)"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this coming out now? Slender the 8 pages came out years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Diluted film frames, time lapse, Ringesque scenes,usual drone footage from above its all been done before........"
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,Please donate the money from this to medical research this is criminal
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when Slender Man was scary? Good times.
ySy8mcceTno,Wait... This isnt marble hornets??
ySy8mcceTno,No suit. No pages. Where's the main story?
ySy8mcceTno,So when are they gonna drop a fornite movie trailer
ySy8mcceTno,He's alive he's alive Slender Man!!
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmmmm.....
ySy8mcceTno,2012 anyone???
ySy8mcceTno,Is this based on the game or the legend
ySy8mcceTno,Someone do a jet pack joyride movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is... is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I WANT A SLENDER MAN MOVIE SOOOO BAD
ySy8mcceTno,what have u done
ySy8mcceTno,Yall are about 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer seems like it's going to be better than the actual movie. Hope it ends up being good.
ySy8mcceTno,This is the real trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony Pictures, why does that not surprise me?"
ySy8mcceTno,.06% content 99.94% filler
ySy8mcceTno,"Yep











This looks bad"
ySy8mcceTno,I love the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,"Can't wait until 6 more years for the ""Jeff the Killer"" movie. Lmfao"
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it would follow a similar plot to the marble hornets.... ._. Oh well...
ySy8mcceTno,Directed by Bray Wyatt
ySy8mcceTno,Llega tarde aprox 6 años tarde y es un asco rompe todas las reglas de el Creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,How about the temple run movie??
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like trash. If they sent this movie out a few years back then it would of done amazing. They probably wont get as many people but knowing ""creepy"" fandoms it'll do okay."
ySy8mcceTno,Come back 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"now what? will we have to wait another 5-10 years to get some ""creepy pastas""-to-movie adaptations? this is as lame as some of those stories..."
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't believe they used that lame, tired old effect of someones head shaking around all sped up and blurry. That is so stupid and just plain cheesy. And in a NEW movie ? WTF"
ySy8mcceTno,"too late sony, 2014 at least 2015 but now?"
ySy8mcceTno,ahora si se viene lo shido
ySy8mcceTno,Wait sooooo SLENDER MAN THE MOVIE IS A THING???
ySy8mcceTno,Neat
ySy8mcceTno,isnt it bit late for this. its not as popular anymore as it used to be. if this was made 2014 then maybe I would understand it then. but now.
ySy8mcceTno,Why was slenders face black?
ySy8mcceTno,shud hve pewds in this
ySy8mcceTno,OMG this looks scary!
ySy8mcceTno,Looks interesting but probably won't watch it. I think that the way they are taking it is better than just him killing people. If they add a pewdiepie face cam it would be a solid 7/3
ySy8mcceTno,considering the party started and ended in 2012ish
ySy8mcceTno,a tad bit too late to the party
ySy8mcceTno,So borning 😩😩😩😧
ySy8mcceTno,Please be good please be good please be good
ySy8mcceTno,"A horrific internet idea memed it's way to hollywood. What's next, forever alone?"
ySy8mcceTno,Of course. They come out with the movie years and years after the popularity of slender man died.
ySy8mcceTno,Solid meme
ySy8mcceTno,WILL BYERS!!!
ySy8mcceTno,They are Going to Turn years of Creepy Pasta into a Shlock Horror film for Profit
ySy8mcceTno,"If they're doing creepypastas now, I expect a movie based on Jeff the Killer, Russian Sleep Experiement, and the one I want to see the most, SCPF."
ySy8mcceTno,It would have been awesome if Blumhouse production is associated with Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,"I am HYPED, slender Man is my favorite monster and he finally gets the horror movie he deserves"
ySy8mcceTno,Si no esta narrada con loquendo no vale ni la pena
ySy8mcceTno,*SLENDER MAN*
ySy8mcceTno,A CREEPYPASTA MOVIE?!?! OH MY GOOOOOSH!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Alv c re mamo
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,Sony I think you should lie down
ySy8mcceTno,We already know this is Gunna flop
ySy8mcceTno,"Demons and ghosts have poor ambitions. They terrorize a few teenage girls for a few days, hide from everybody else, are so seldom encountered that nobody believes they exist, and meanwhile some manufacturing company spits out a product with a faulty mechanism that kills 20 people a year gruesomely. Total amateur hour with these guys."
ySy8mcceTno,"Yo pensé que era un pato, veanle sus patas valgame :v"
ySy8mcceTno,slender man you say? this must be a joke.
ySy8mcceTno,Make 1 on jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Looks lame and cgi has killed horror
ySy8mcceTno,Potential rapist
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh these people are late slender man be came irrelevant
ySy8mcceTno,Did any one noticed that the blood that on the girl face is black 🧐🧐 1:35
ySy8mcceTno,I'm intrigued.
ySy8mcceTno,Concerte Giraffes live action addition looks terrible. Where’s Marik Ishtar?
ySy8mcceTno,I love CreepyPasta 😍
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony having failed to make their Ghostbusters cinematic universe, and knowing that their Spider-Man cinematic universe is gonna basically be only anthology movies because of the deal, are almost certainly using this to set up their CreepyPasta Cinematic universe, because all those characters are in the public domain."
ySy8mcceTno,Why'd it have to be Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Probably won't be as good as Marble Hornets but hey. Looks decent enough.
ySy8mcceTno,Too spooky.
ySy8mcceTno,Calling it now its going to be sh*t
ySy8mcceTno,Wdf Sony really slenderman and the history no are same
ySy8mcceTno,WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE NIGHT WHEN I FIND SCARY THINGS?!
ySy8mcceTno,Even though the idea of a Slender Man movie is terrible.. This movie really doesn't look that bad.
ySy8mcceTno,Wut
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is ok and I agree why Sony made the movie because of the thing that happened with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Ala vrga..
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really bad
ySy8mcceTno,The movie will come with bugs?
ySy8mcceTno,"*When everyone forgets about slender man and the idubbbz cringy parody*
*Sony* :let me just get in here"
ySy8mcceTno,lmao y tho
ySy8mcceTno,Lol slender man is such a dead game already!😂
ySy8mcceTno,"yeah this is gonna be another stupid idea like the ouija garbage, only a fool would make another gateway and an even bigger fool to watch such garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,Well...
ySy8mcceTno,*HI*
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah I prefer the fan made trailer its more epic
ySy8mcceTno,No wonder Sony keeps losing millions of dollars trying to make movies
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder what happened to the girl’s hands at 2:16. I really believe that they got long like Slender Man’s. I truly do!
ySy8mcceTno,2012 eres tu ?
ySy8mcceTno,Se tardaron un chingo no mamen
ySy8mcceTno,8 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Wait it this really happening?
ySy8mcceTno,U up?
ySy8mcceTno,Better late than never I guess
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"After credit scene.. Nick fury came from the shadow saying stuff like ""I believe we can make a good use for man like you.."""
ySy8mcceTno,Nice trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Idon't know rick seems fake
ySy8mcceTno,se supone que slenderman era un pedófilo que mataba niños >:v porque ataca ahora a las lolis adolescentes •`<′•

ySy8mcceTno,.________.
ySy8mcceTno,What’s wrong with it just being one mysterious being in a forest? Why all this extra stuff?
ySy8mcceTno,Goddamn
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman was better left alone its clear from the trailer that they fucked up. you can't do Slenderman without the 8 pages. which in my opinion would have made a better netflix series
ySy8mcceTno,i would watch this but get nightmares after
ySy8mcceTno,i don’t watch horror movie alone only when it’s light in a day with my friends or family then the night time     i won’t get out stay in house alone
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fr?
ySy8mcceTno,aing hayang nonton blog
ySy8mcceTno,"Ill pass, Peppa Pig horror maybe?"
ySy8mcceTno,"why
just dont"
ySy8mcceTno,Really? Film based from a game?
ySy8mcceTno,This shouldve came out in at latest 2014
ySy8mcceTno,Hype train
ySy8mcceTno,This is more about those people that killed or attempted for slender man except he’s real instead of the 8 pages
ySy8mcceTno,Wouuuu wtf :v
ySy8mcceTno,I'm just gonna back away before the fangirls and fanfics come back...
ySy8mcceTno,"no sé ustedes , pero creo que esta película va a ser un asco"
ySy8mcceTno,This going to be either really good or really bad.
ySy8mcceTno,Well done...5 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,"I prefer marble hornets (even though that's the operator, but still it's better)"
ySy8mcceTno,"no es verdad
dime que no es verdad"
ySy8mcceTno,Don ta eslendi
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for you guys to make a movie about this creepypasta and finnaly here it is
ySy8mcceTno,I’m just hiding in the comment section who’s with me ? :D
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the suit!?
ySy8mcceTno,The plot dosen't make any sense 😒
ySy8mcceTno,Should be called bankrupt man
ySy8mcceTno,This looks trash
ySy8mcceTno,Good God FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Stupidass trailer slenderman only comes out in one scene.     Gaaaaayyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,about 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Definitivamente este es mi año
ySy8mcceTno,Not what i was expecting
ySy8mcceTno,At least it wasn't made by EA. Who knows how they would fit micro transactions in here.
ySy8mcceTno,Hogwash! You can't even see him!!
ySy8mcceTno,fake
ySy8mcceTno,5 or 6 Years late jesus christ
ySy8mcceTno,Bish wuyt
ySy8mcceTno,"MAN, SLENDER MAN DOESNT EVEN APPEAR IN THE TRAILER, WHAT THE HECK!"
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't see any tentacles
ySy8mcceTno,"I already know this is gonna suck, rip"
ySy8mcceTno,"also...the original plot of slender man is him hanging around play grounds watching children. he was a photo contest entry first, then a game."
ySy8mcceTno,Not even close
ySy8mcceTno,1:55 loud nigra scream
ySy8mcceTno,Que mierda
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok. so its not gonna be like the game it seems. this should be fine. they want to create their own lore for the character. so i suggest going into this movie looking at it as it's own thing first, then as a fan of the game. What i personally hope is that it will focus more on psychological horror they jump scares and it seems it might. No that all being said i look forward to seeing if and how they can implement the static from the game in."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman is supposed to be mysterious to its core, is it real or a mental problem? what does it want? what is it? Why does it follow children? What happens to who it takes? 
Please don't turn him into the stereotypical, jumpscary, wants you dead monster. Slenderman was the foundation for creepypastas and bassically modern horror i hope they do it good."
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie looks screwed up and awesome at the same time, I really hope this movie gets a rating because a lot of times non rated films don't get released in theaters, and if this movie does go to theaters im definitely going to ask my dad if he can take me"
ySy8mcceTno,"I count this movie as a  50/100 bc it doesn't have the original 8 pages, this is sad to me bc I'm a huge creepypasta fan"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like the ring
ySy8mcceTno,lol. does sony really expect to make a movie about a meme and try to make it scary?
ySy8mcceTno,Remember Marble Hornets Slenderman series? I thought they were going to make a movie about that.
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the roblox phantom forces movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it should be called Slender, instead of Slenderman. Just seems a little better"
ySy8mcceTno,Kind have copied THE RING with the freaky imagery
ySy8mcceTno,"Lo espere por dos años c"":"
ySy8mcceTno,And the creator of Slenderman is chill with this?
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t seem like slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Where's  Ticci Toby,masky,and hoodey, (Like if u know what I'm talking about)"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like the sequel to the happining
ySy8mcceTno,"The hype is real!!!!!! And I can feel it, we have all been waiting"
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, who hacked Sony's account and posted this?"
ySy8mcceTno,I get it it's about slender man's daughter not him (well maybe a little bit of him)But honestly took then long enough there kinda late tho
ySy8mcceTno,I don't remember people wanting to kill themselves and looking like zombies as part of the slenderman lore.
ySy8mcceTno,So..... Slenderman Is not more a creepy.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why bother, modern horror movies are usually bad enough, but a horror - game movie? .... ugh"
ySy8mcceTno,When this started I was like ok this is gonna be what makes me not sleep at night😂 the. I watched I’m like bruh this isn’t even CLOSE to scary the GAME scared me 😂😂😂 like fr Sony?!
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, Sony if ur listening please stop, it started with Spider Man 3, moving to the emoji movie, then to Slender man. The story has been dead for over five, it's been told, I'm not impressed. I'm excited for the animated Spider Man, don't screw this one up or I'm done paying you my money."
ySy8mcceTno,Alv
ySy8mcceTno,Prob going to be bad
ySy8mcceTno,Oof didn’t know he can teleport oops 😬 1:53
ySy8mcceTno,"Walked in the woods, found a creepy fucka, found a creepy fucka, walked in the woods..."
ySy8mcceTno,From game to movie.. WILL THERE BE A BOOK?!
ySy8mcceTno,This will def not be on top horror movies unless they are really good
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf!!?
ySy8mcceTno,They’re making a slender man?! Psh your late friends
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSSSSS!
ySy8mcceTno,WHY ?
ySy8mcceTno,¡¿ESTO ES REAL?! :0
ySy8mcceTno,So now they man a Slender movie??!!
ySy8mcceTno,Miniminter
ySy8mcceTno,2018...2018!!!
ySy8mcceTno,So stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Gay and like 7 years late
ySy8mcceTno,ooooh a movie about a skinny man who stalks you and you collect pages but this tells a diffent story... 10/10 i can see the money rolling in when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY they’re making a movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"you already show whole movie in this ""Trailer"""
ySy8mcceTno,Oof
ySy8mcceTno,"I am just gonna say:

????"
ySy8mcceTno,who else is here from stranger things ..
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya lo malograron, le han puesto el típico Cliché de la mayoría de películas de terror."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not watching this crap.I'm pretty sure Sony just wants my $20.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is not what I was expecting, and not in a good way either"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie doesn't have to match up with the game and everything else. this actually looks amazing in my opinion. I can't wait to watch it
ySy8mcceTno,dope
ySy8mcceTno,Is this actually real?
ySy8mcceTno,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,K lol.
ySy8mcceTno,"0:08 
Logan Paul are you here?"
ySy8mcceTno,No lo c rick parece falso
ySy8mcceTno,They actually filmed this really close to my hometown.  The studio was right over in Fort Devens in Massachusetts.  Some of us at our school got to take a tour of it.  Closest I've ever been to anything like it.  That fucking repurposed aircraft hangar set room was insane.
ySy8mcceTno,Wasnt this dead literally 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,You're about 5 years late Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,This is not slender its just a girl in blood
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when he was Just a game :')
ySy8mcceTno,As a kid (5th grade) I made a better plot than what ever this is
ySy8mcceTno,"For a fan made trailer it wasn´t that bad, at least the title is good...."
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks! I hate it.
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this game
ySy8mcceTno,Para cuando una peli sobre el chupacabras? >:v
ySy8mcceTno,When se te acaban las ideas para las peliculas :v xD
ySy8mcceTno,There's no way to be scared watching cgi effects
ySy8mcceTno,Oie no era pa tanto hacer una película sobre ello si eres fan de slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,I mean they're only like 4 years late to the Slenderman craze
ySy8mcceTno,Best movie of 2018 is right here I'm not being sarcastic
ySy8mcceTno,Omg finally
ySy8mcceTno,Oh finally
ySy8mcceTno,This game/movie/myth died years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m excited, but this trailer is so poor😂"
ySy8mcceTno,"If you do not know da wey, you will get caught my slenderbae"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like the fake trailers before Tropic Thunder.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is like one of those things that no one asks for, but they make it anyway."
ySy8mcceTno,Hype
ySy8mcceTno,OK THEN
ySy8mcceTno,lmaoo
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s the Pewds?
ySy8mcceTno,Now that was scary
ySy8mcceTno,Just when everybody starts to not give a crap about slender man he rises up and makes a movie with all his 8 hands
ySy8mcceTno,Also we have to remember that Slenderman ORIGINATED from a Creepypasta drawing. The game came after.
ySy8mcceTno,C mamo
ySy8mcceTno,They should not have made this the story won't be the same. Plus he wasent even in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Yawn😴💤
ySy8mcceTno,Looks interesting. At the same time those disturbing images remind me of 'the Ring'.
ySy8mcceTno,one slender boy
ySy8mcceTno,THEY NEED TO MAKE A CREEPYPASTA MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,This is about 5 years too late lol
ySy8mcceTno,The Emoji Movie 2 is looking really good
ySy8mcceTno,Please tell me this is real
ySy8mcceTno,"About fucking time, hopefully it's not completely terrible"
ySy8mcceTno,Is it 2012 or something ?
ySy8mcceTno,Looking forward!
ySy8mcceTno,de lo que fue un  crrepypasta haora una pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,I'm good
ySy8mcceTno,Where slendy at
ySy8mcceTno,What lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"Be careful,Sony. You already screwed up on the emoji movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets already exists....
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so confused
ySy8mcceTno,this movie looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"I am excited about this, does anyone wants to see it wid me?"
ySy8mcceTno,THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED.... 😈😈😈
ySy8mcceTno,OH BOY I CANNOT WAIT TO WATCH THE MOVIE 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time they made another one
ySy8mcceTno,Slender tender men
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,This is not like the iconic Slenderman we all know and love. Even Minecraft got it right. This is something else. I do not even see Slenderman in here.
ySy8mcceTno,Wut
ySy8mcceTno,what's next? temple run?
ySy8mcceTno,People should just stop trying to make video game movies (and anime movies). They’re always inaccurate.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg this is the bitchiest comment section hahaha
ySy8mcceTno,"You cant see him




HIS TIME IS NOW."
ySy8mcceTno,Next year FarmVille the movie!  That’s still cool right guys?
ySy8mcceTno,Ele nao aparece
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like this is just gonna be a generic monster/ghost movie with cheap jumpscares, like Paranormal Activity or Insidious"
ySy8mcceTno,Could a horror movie be any less scary?  Too late imo
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,"A bit late to the game, Sony. Hey, how's that Five Nights at Cashie Grabbie's movie coming around?"
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly at this point I want a movie about Slendy being the best dad he can be to all his adopted children.
ySy8mcceTno,"Way to strike while the iron is hot, you guys"
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks amazing but what about the 8 pages or static or slender sickness, it doesn't line up with he creepypasta or the game"
ySy8mcceTno,God damit
ySy8mcceTno,I think the plot of this is cause he makes you crazy in the game you see things and your camera gets fuzzy he makes you insane he tortures you he 8 pages are years after the stabbing or what ever this movie is about thats y that girl killed her self i with the disecting tool he made her go crazy to commit suicide
ySy8mcceTno,if you want this trailer to be scarier mute it you will see what i mean
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,Echen a perder otra gran historia con su pendejadas de peliculas -.-
ySy8mcceTno,Where's his suit ? moving naked in the forest isn't scary
ySy8mcceTno,"Pls do not let this movie be trash😩. But sometimes when the trailer is trash, the movie is quite nice so we’ll see🤷🏽‍♀️"
ySy8mcceTno,This is a basted on a Creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man is a dead meme, even though I loved that game when it just came out its sorta dumb to just now bring it up again and make it seem like it has nothing to do with the actual game. Even the shitty indie movie based off the game might end up being better than this"
ySy8mcceTno,Ok if you read the under the caption it tells you a small bit of the plot. Hope that helps some people.
ySy8mcceTno,"I didn’t like the girls acting, he screams seemed fake"
ySy8mcceTno,"step 1: change the name
step 2: come to realize that everyone will stop crying about it and appreciate it for what it is, not what it's based from"
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 4 years late? Sis.
ySy8mcceTno,"Such a simple, scary idea and Sony went over the top and ruined it."
ySy8mcceTno,Now all I need is a motive with philosophy or something more behind the actions of THIS slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they somehow mention Slender: The Eight Pages or even The Arrival. Maybe a reference to Charlie or maybe make him a Proxy in the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Just give him 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,"only if there's a freddy vs jason type thing after this movie with Jeff vs Slenderman
Dibs on jeff, I can actually act insane while still being coherent"
ySy8mcceTno,vote early soviet brief division smile town along release grip night property
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf? :D
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m sorry, no thanks"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the movie good if not Sony ruin another movie
ySy8mcceTno,what is the maturity??? lol i wanna see it on the biograph
ySy8mcceTno,The beginning graveyard scene was filmed in my town....
ySy8mcceTno,NOT wat i was hoping for but who knows u guys the movie might be friggin awesome lets just HOPE FOR THE BEST😊
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait 😊
ySy8mcceTno,This would be a great movie you know... like years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Hoodie, Masky , and ticci Toby better be there and they have the lore right"
ySy8mcceTno,Starring pewds
ySy8mcceTno,what does any of this have to do with slenderman besides him being in the movie tho.. theres none of *his* plot to it. im kinda disappointed but id probably still watch it
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,I'm here for the gay elephant noise.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,20 dollars says it'll be terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Now we just need jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it was made by Gabe from The Office
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not sure but i think that tjis movie slenderman is aboit a VIRUS....
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,badly made...
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve increíblemente mala
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, uh, Sony? You're uh, a teeny tiny bit late to the party..."
ySy8mcceTno,This is really in bad taste since a young girl was murdered by her friends over this phenomenon.
ySy8mcceTno,"It doesn't really seem scary tho, more intense? and disgusting bc of the worms??"
ySy8mcceTno,fack this fnaf i return to slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Wow just wow
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like the worst movie I ever see. I just saw Slenderman 1 time. If you want to remake a classic just follow the dam history.
ySy8mcceTno,Well done sony! You're only nine years late!
ySy8mcceTno,"Thank you very much sony pictures to destroy the best creepypasta of the forum, thank you to not follow the story, the videogames... Thank you to put worms and turn people into zombies, thank you to don't remember to put the song of "" he's watching me with no eyes"" , thank you to put to slenderman in only one scene, you've always made it sony pictures you've arruined me the best filma ever... # Sarcastic"
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman is such a good character with great source material and they just make it look like bye-bye man or any other scary movie... really dissapointing
ySy8mcceTno,Spoopy
ySy8mcceTno,They didn’t show him that much
ySy8mcceTno,This is about 5 years too late to be relevant now
ySy8mcceTno,slender man is barely even related to anything in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,The most shitty cliche trailer I have ever seen. Please you already killed spider Man no more sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Alguien español ._.
ySy8mcceTno,TOTALLY MOST DEFINITELY SEEING THIS WITH MY FATHER
ySy8mcceTno,My Complain...Is....why was there only 2 voices in this trailer.....I mean in every trailer....there is people saying short comments...but in this one....there is only 2...I mean WHY?!
ySy8mcceTno,*panting heavily* I've been waiting years for this!
ySy8mcceTno,I like the special effects
ySy8mcceTno,Whack...
ySy8mcceTno,Yaaaaaaasssssssss
ySy8mcceTno,اللي متحمس لايك
ySy8mcceTno,AWFUL
ySy8mcceTno,Am i supposed too be scared ?
ySy8mcceTno,Garbage
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t get it
ySy8mcceTno,xdxdxdxd
ySy8mcceTno,"*Tras tantos años de ver fan mades, fechas de salidas erronias porfin una pelicula oficial :''v*"
ySy8mcceTno,I can't be the only one who initially read that as Spiderman
ySy8mcceTno,weird does not equal creepy.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late and done wrong. Yeet
ySy8mcceTno,:v
ySy8mcceTno,I bet this film was made a few years back when slender man was a thing? Then the whole murder thing happened with the young girls and Sony had no choice but to push it back.
ySy8mcceTno,Like 8
ySy8mcceTno,"This may very well be, the worst horror movie ever made."
ySy8mcceTno,Great idea... but generic terror... like the games in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Lol Slenderman is so 2009
ySy8mcceTno,FANMADE film by Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"WOOH THIS IS CRAZY, MEN"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, Sony hyped us up with Spider-Man, then this. Like we needed more slenderman stuff."
ySy8mcceTno,Bye Bye Man 2.0
ySy8mcceTno,😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😗😍😘😘😘😘
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol, the jumpscare was right on que. This looks like a typical crappy horror movie, relying on shocking imagery and jumpscares, while riding on a creepypasta character that has severely outstayed it’s welcome."
ySy8mcceTno,WTF?!
ySy8mcceTno,"Is it just me or did we already see this horror movie MULTIPLE times before?
Edit:#CanYouSeeHim
Can I see him watching this? Never in a million decades."
ySy8mcceTno,I give the trailer an eh.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh slender man is still a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao seriously?
ySy8mcceTno,Resident Evil 7 mud monster anyone??
ySy8mcceTno,I wish this movie was actually about slender man ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so over horror movies
ySy8mcceTno,That trailer was horrible... still not sure what the plot is
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like they only named it Slenderman for the internet hype while in reality slenderman has nothing to do with the movie... Bullshit!
ySy8mcceTno,this seem like one of those art movies wth give me slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,El creador del creepy a de estar bien feliz :v
ySy8mcceTno,"From the folks behind Emoji Movie, comes SLENDER MAN MOVIE! (Yeah, it's 2018!)"
ySy8mcceTno,*Starring Payton Leutner*
ySy8mcceTno,RIP Slender.
ySy8mcceTno,Could have been done so much better looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,No te pases de vergaa!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know why but I'm looking forward to this. Slenderman introduced to me to the bulk of the internet and I respect the creator and creepypasta for it. If the movie is good it will be even better, it probably won't be good at all but it will be a novelty movie."
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't know slendy can make people into zombies
ySy8mcceTno,EGHEHEMM strangerthings copy EGHEHEMM
ySy8mcceTno,great idea! first they wait the slenderman trend totally die and bring it back alive with great movie i hope
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a slender movie
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,Why did they change his look to fuzzy scrunge? One of the scariest parts of the legend is that he looks normal in photographs if you don't know the context.
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all did my man slendi so dirty smh
ySy8mcceTno,"like most Sony movies...
It had potential"
ySy8mcceTno,1035
ySy8mcceTno,Esperó que No caguen a Slenderman porqué es una de mis crepypastas favoritas :/
ySy8mcceTno,Next up is *Animoji* *Movie*
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to c SLENDER MAN movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Its not like the original slender man stories or games. I dont like it
ySy8mcceTno,I miss marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,And this trailer did nothing to convince me to see this.
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late m8
ySy8mcceTno,"I swear to god if people will dress up as Slender Man and go out in the woods, I'm done"
ySy8mcceTno,If only this happened to Logan Paul when he was in the forest smh
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh good, another movie based off memes culture, i hope this will turn out like the last pop culture film, the emoji movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Kesin yine korkup gidemicem aq
ySy8mcceTno,It’s like movie studios like losing money
ySy8mcceTno,worst video game adaptation since the Mario Bros. Movie
ySy8mcceTno,the fucking bye bye man was a better slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Thia sas relevant in 2012...
ySy8mcceTno,Just like Diary of a whimpy kid and The Angry Birds Movie....Just a SMIDGE bit late on the Trend there Buddy
ySy8mcceTno,"""He gets in your head like a virus""? I guess a virus also spreads to the head when infecting a body but I still think it's a weird analogy."
ySy8mcceTno,man this would've been a real money maker back in 2013-2014 when I was all my friends were 14 and afraid of Slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,"Better luck next time, Sony. I can’t wait for your next big hit, the Gangnam Style movie. Ps: Samir did 9/11"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is based on creepypasta about Slender- sickness
ySy8mcceTno,"""Coming this summer to select theaters... Kevin James is Chubby Man... based on actual events"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Like two years late, this could have been the most sold out horror but they had to wait lmao"
ySy8mcceTno,"Mmmm, I think you're a little late.. Like...5 years late JJAJAAAJAA"
ySy8mcceTno,wat?
ySy8mcceTno,aw it looks like he wont be in his trademark suit :(
ySy8mcceTno,"uhhh i'll just ask, why would they do this when now we are not talking about this ostly five nights at freedy's or duck hunt or whatever other trending stuff we talk about? Sure it's true that some people talk and/or make videos about it but it when was the last time so many talked about slender man because 5 years ago he was the most trending thing to talk about terror. I dont mind that Sony makes this movie but like the rest of commenters allready said you're kinda late pal."
ySy8mcceTno,Pfahahaha ffs
ySy8mcceTno,You missed the hype by almost a fucking decade.
ySy8mcceTno,"What year is this, 2006?"
ySy8mcceTno,Very much scäry. Scery slederman
ySy8mcceTno,2018 here
ySy8mcceTno,1:49 I honestly don't know how you could make a jumpscare more predictable than that
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t think this is relevant anymore but ok
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 WHAT IS THAT!?!?!? Last I checked Slender wore a black suit and had a blank white face... That's not anything I just described.... And yet another good thing ruined by the way of Horror movie creators.... What next?
ySy8mcceTno,The low quality/budget Slender Man ARG's made by some youtubers years ago put this to shame. Just goes to show big buck Hollywood ain't the be all end all.
ySy8mcceTno,Took you long enough.
ySy8mcceTno,Wait... This is still relevant? XDD
ySy8mcceTno,"I like the Slenderman, but this trailer just feels generic"
ySy8mcceTno,"Completely went agains the creepypasta, but apart from that looks like a mint film"
ySy8mcceTno,Esse trailer do slender tá não tem MT coisa a ver com a história dele
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul finds Slenderman in Japanese suicide forest
ySy8mcceTno,"Uhhuuuuuuuu , Slender porra , até que enfim , dps de mais de 10 anos karay , creepy pasta de Slender que dlc"
ySy8mcceTno,Who is dieing to watch this!!!??? I know I am!
ySy8mcceTno,This would have only been relevant in 2012...
ySy8mcceTno,Mmmmmkaaaaay...?
ySy8mcceTno,"Great Just what we needed,another cash grab horror flick"
ySy8mcceTno,gay
ySy8mcceTno,lol they spelled Enderman wrong XDDDD
ySy8mcceTno,amazing horror movie [ naver.pe/112xefp40520mj ]
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should not be made
ySy8mcceTno,"5 años antes Sony, 5 años antes."
ySy8mcceTno,He just wants his $20
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Not true to the creepypasta my hopes are down
ySy8mcceTno,"Marble Hornets?
True Slenderman lore may be represented here."
ySy8mcceTno,the slimmest of men
ySy8mcceTno,"All these hate comments, but I guarantee all of you are gonna watch it still."
ySy8mcceTno,Im with eiecctro on this one
ySy8mcceTno,Pa cuando la de dear David
ySy8mcceTno,This is so bad 🤢🤮
ySy8mcceTno,I Thought it was spider man.. I so stupid haha
ySy8mcceTno,All he wanted was 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie might suck lol, i may wait for it to come on dvd"
ySy8mcceTno,I hate what Sony does here: take a great story and and add way too much extra. ruining it
ySy8mcceTno,"They got it wrong. EVERYBODY can see slendy, but it’s only if you look at him to long or if he’s close to you than he can kill you."
ySy8mcceTno,Uhm. Looks cheap.
ySy8mcceTno,Que decepción la traición hermano :v
ySy8mcceTno,Only got half way through the trailer before I realised I'm not going to like it. Seems like a whole lot of nothing happening for the sake of having a slender man movie.
ySy8mcceTno,So this movie is real right?
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhhhhh yes!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Still waiting on the slenderman trailer, I don’t know what that was but it was...not slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,Based on a true story
ySy8mcceTno,What about the 8 pages? The plot doesn't add up from this trailer..
ySy8mcceTno,Can't believe it's 2012 already!
ySy8mcceTno,"They just wanna make a quick buck, nothing else, they don't care about the story."
ySy8mcceTno,Someone's gonna get stabbed 20+ times as an offering that this movie will be good.
ySy8mcceTno,"Such great source material, ruined"
ySy8mcceTno,Mazoq esse filme vai ser foda ;u;
ySy8mcceTno,Voi vittu
ySy8mcceTno,I'd rather watch Scat Porn.
ySy8mcceTno,Well... I expected to be like the creepypasta version but... Yeah a little bit disappointing...
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,what is happening
ySy8mcceTno,Well... only 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks
ySy8mcceTno,Porque no esta contada con loquendo?
ySy8mcceTno,Je ne sais pas pourquoi mais je suis quasiment sûr qu'on ne va jamais le voir réellement dans le film et il fera probablement qu'une ou deux apparitions...
ySy8mcceTno,yay
ySy8mcceTno,Не страшно(
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the Killer movie!?
ySy8mcceTno,um verdadeiro cu
ySy8mcceTno,Please let this be a real thing. I would pay so many times to see this.
ySy8mcceTno,someone English
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie based on a 4chan post? Sure, how can that go wrong??"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow that movie really comes out but just 3 years late
ySy8mcceTno,-10 >:v
ySy8mcceTno,The Happening...TWOOOOOOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,B movie much? 🧐
ySy8mcceTno,Brought to you by the creators of the EMOJI movie
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,I would attack one my friends in the woods with a knife just to stop this movie from happening
ySy8mcceTno,Pewdiepie
ySy8mcceTno,Well It's sony so..... the hole thing is one big ad
ySy8mcceTno,"Now that I think about this, they should make a film for every deep creepy pasta."
ySy8mcceTno,My childhood nightmares just came flooding back.
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn't look scary to me, just boring"
ySy8mcceTno,*send help*
ySy8mcceTno,Quack
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul : The Suicide Forest
ySy8mcceTno,Wow they're gonna ruin it...
ySy8mcceTno,What did any of that have to do with  slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Its 1:00 am, what am I doing."
ySy8mcceTno,You know it’s bad when they have to start with a trailer before the actual trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,No no no no! IM NOT GOING TO SEE SLENDERMAN AGAIN! IT'S A NIGHTMARE NO NO NO NO *SCREAMS*
ySy8mcceTno,Graphic warning before i watch the trailer? ANYONE? PLS REPLY
ySy8mcceTno,Farkk...This came a bit late. And now I'm not even into slender. 😅😡😠😢😤. Sure it's no fake trailer or maybe it won't  be released? Why release a kid horror game to a world wide movie like wow. Would've been handy 8 years ago when people were interested.
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t say it’s going to be bad just from watching the trailer. Don’t judge it until you see the movie. If you want to judge it now how about you try making a horror movie? See how that works out for yah.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this references Marble Hornets. And doesn't reference those kids who killed their friend and blamed it on an internet meme. That's...not part of the lore.
ySy8mcceTno,"What's our next big idea? What's gonna make us money? I got it, let's use one of those creepypasta characters and just like completely change their storyline, the people will love it"
ySy8mcceTno,...stupid slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,que buenos tiempos tiempos cuando slender me daba miedo
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this is actually happening!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Idiots who think this sucks read this comment:

Slenderman isn't physical thing. His a demon that corrupts minds of children. You are not suppose to how he actually looks because his depiction would campy. This is slenderman done right. A shadowy figure that causes night terrors. Those worms are either worst nightmare of someone or Slender nan is telepathic. That girl is slowly becoming proxy. How does Slender man scientifically exist? Hallucinogenic forest gases."
ySy8mcceTno,Eu vo assistir com sertesa
ySy8mcceTno,"Concrete giraffes, anyone?"
ySy8mcceTno,Was it supposed to be scary??🤔
ySy8mcceTno,When will Hollywood learn that video game based movies always suck
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this! That is not Slenderman :/.
ySy8mcceTno,Nice
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the real movie this time😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Finally! I've been waiting sience 2015
ySy8mcceTno,we didn’t ask for this
ySy8mcceTno,What's next Jeff the Killer movie being a generic slasher horror
ySy8mcceTno,Vai ser uma bosta
ySy8mcceTno,best trailer nor does the slender man appear
ySy8mcceTno,looks like one of those bad Netflix horror movies
ySy8mcceTno,Cool next make a fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, why did it have to be Sony? Why not just anyone BUT sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,From the creators of the emoji movie Slenderman!
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally an actual movie, I was getting sick of fan made trailers"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony first you make a good horror movie and then we’ll talk
ySy8mcceTno,The Ring 3
ySy8mcceTno,"this is like going from 4d back to 2d, the conversion doesnt go to completion.
A game is a fully immersive experience, a film, no matter the quality, will always seem flat compared to it."
ySy8mcceTno,"The cringe... emoji, help, it's gonna kill me."
ySy8mcceTno,Like 2pac movie disappointment... all that time for prep...
ySy8mcceTno,Bro what the heck 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,There is no way anyone would find this scary! people who think this is gonna be good have never heard/know anything about Slender Man this movie looks like a comedy. Also Slender man was 2012 do people even know Slender Man anymore?
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, being a fan of creepy pasta and seeing THIS. I’m kind of disappointed. Like at least they’re making a movie about it. But I have one last shred o hope for this. They better not screw it up."
ySy8mcceTno,Why didn't they just do the traditional eight pages or something like Slender: The Arrival?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy.. time to get back into creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Donde esta el loquendo?
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things season 3 looks great!
ySy8mcceTno,more like Blender Man
ySy8mcceTno,fanmade are better
ySy8mcceTno,They should have made this movie around 2011 or 2015
ySy8mcceTno,There is nooo may that’s going to be slender man the movie where is the white faced creature where are the pages??? WHY IS THERE A GIRL????
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys,i think it will be a psychologycal horror type. Don t blame the movie cuz Slender won t appear constantly."
ySy8mcceTno,If they made this 6 years ago it’s would have been great
ySy8mcceTno,Omgomgomg
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a student horror film.
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê o slender pra ser um filme do slender precisa aparecer ele que bosta
ySy8mcceTno,"Jeff The Killer, Coming 2036"
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"I see comments from people who are excited about this, and from people who are disapointed... Personaly, I am disapointed too. Slender Man was my first horror game I've played, and that game is the reason I love horror games nowdays.

Slender Man was originally in a photoshop contest, he evolved into a game, and now to this movie. I am disapointed, because what I saw in the trailer, that kind of experience is far away from the experience I had playing the game. I don't know if the full movie will have that kind of feeling, but that can't help about I am being disapointed..."
ySy8mcceTno,"No lo se Rick, parece falso"
ySy8mcceTno,stop
ySy8mcceTno,Fucking hilarious
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m I the only one that actually has hope for this movie?
Yes?......ok"
ySy8mcceTno,This zambie movie or what
ySy8mcceTno,What was I expecting from Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Adolescent reliable word amazing strongly hidden taste do simple hypothesis primary time.
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry man to say this your 6 yeas late
ySy8mcceTno,took long enough
ySy8mcceTno,I will admit it’s a bit late but ok. Let’s go.
ySy8mcceTno,2:15 Kate?
ySy8mcceTno,Gelse de izlesem
ySy8mcceTno,Y am i watching this when I'm eating
ySy8mcceTno,"some of this looks like zalgos corruption and them saying ""it's him"" doesn't help"
ySy8mcceTno,"For it to be truly a horror movie on slender man, it would need to be found footage, for respect of the original creepypasta and the fandom based on it. This shitty special effects with a half baked story"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this good or bad? Opinions and please elaborate.
ySy8mcceTno,Little late there lads.
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell was this crap?
ySy8mcceTno,"From a creepypasta to a horror legend, the world will see this."
ySy8mcceTno,Guys! I understand that some of you are very excited for it... I also sometimes get very excited when I have to dump... This movie and Crap are heavily related
ySy8mcceTno,GAY
ySy8mcceTno,Hope the film is better then the trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,What's with these random scenes happening? Like where's my boi slendy screen time gone to?
ySy8mcceTno,Let's face it people.  The horror genre is dead.
ySy8mcceTno,"Another ""emoji movie""... ughh..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man, and emoji movie.... Made by sony. Wow"
ySy8mcceTno,Do u noe de wey
ySy8mcceTno,So creepypastas are getting movies now?
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone notice how similar this looks to the Bye Bye Man?
ySy8mcceTno,Weak
ySy8mcceTno,"I wonder what age this is rated for, looks pretty cool, reminds me of the Blair witch project"
ySy8mcceTno,"Интересно, а поможет ли слендер против пиратов?"
ySy8mcceTno,*awwwwwwww snap this is gonna be good*
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda expected they would feature slendy a bit and some pages in the woods. 😫
ySy8mcceTno,Should've included inspiration and a bit of research from the person who actually wrote the story in the first place.
ySy8mcceTno,"FINALLY!!! Oh wait... this movie is bullshit. All movie makers should do their research first before making a movie especially if the movie will be based on video games, urban legends, etc."
ySy8mcceTno,Great now i cant sleep
ySy8mcceTno,They may aswell re master the chuckie series
ySy8mcceTno,Omg yes!
ySy8mcceTno,"And yet again, another garbage Slender Man movie..."
ySy8mcceTno,"No all we need is....
Jeff and Jane the Killer
The rake
Eyeless Jack
Ben Drowned
and the rest of creeepypastas"
ySy8mcceTno,😒 meh i dont like it
ySy8mcceTno,insert tv effect here
ySy8mcceTno,is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,finally!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Lol this movie is so late.
ySy8mcceTno,Please make horror movies great again🙏🏼😿
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty stupid tbh
ySy8mcceTno,I'm really disappointed they went for the whole girls who stabbed their friend angle instead of it being about the actual myth of how he steals children and appears in the background of pictures.
ySy8mcceTno,somebody touch my spaghet
ySy8mcceTno,We need jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,THIS WILL BE MY BIRTHDAY GIFT
ySy8mcceTno,What does Slenderman even do I never understood the story with him
ySy8mcceTno,Only took you about 7 years..
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is a woman? What?
ySy8mcceTno,Wow it's now 2012 again
ySy8mcceTno,Oh the 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is 6 years late...........
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a Chapter 2 IT😂
ySy8mcceTno,oh……Fu〇k!
ySy8mcceTno,"horror movies these days have all fallen under this hole where people think that loud=scary. a little girl passes by in a hallway really quick, which would be kinda spooky, except that they play audio of a fucking crashing airplane on top of it. and i have no expectations that this movie wont fall under the same principal."
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman.... without.. Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,"After the Emoji Movie, another masterpiece is created."
ySy8mcceTno,Dice 2011 que le regreses a Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,1:02 this is what happens when you run out of movie ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"Not horror, messed up,
#SupportChildAbuseNow"
ySy8mcceTno,3spooky7me
ySy8mcceTno,Are they sure it's not a comedy movie? Because it feels like one
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, you're a few years too late lmao"
ySy8mcceTno,This Looks everything But slenderman :v
ySy8mcceTno,Every like = a day without wanking
ySy8mcceTno,Who writes with their marker in a fist. And so many random spooky clips of nothing. It just seems so generic.
ySy8mcceTno,"UGH it looks like The Ring WAY TOO MUCH
AND Slenderman does not make his victims go crazy...thats Smiledog.jpg"
ySy8mcceTno,"slender man never shown...







even a split second..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Here's a much better idea than this: Campers in the forest
Or maybe a slender the arrival adaption?"
ySy8mcceTno,Please no. Don't ruin him for me. No. Stop.
ySy8mcceTno,So definitely dope. A mixture of psychological + physical horror. Can’t wait!
ySy8mcceTno,"Isn't this a bit in poor taste? The description is about four school girls who look for slender man, I just hope the girl who got stabbed doesn't see this -_-"
ySy8mcceTno,And the notes?......
ySy8mcceTno,This is a little late... the slender man train left the station crashed and burned a long time ago
ySy8mcceTno,IT'S TIME TO STOP
ySy8mcceTno,It is kind of late
ySy8mcceTno,ITS HAPPENING¡!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Swing and a miss. Clearly don't get what slender man is or why he's scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Trying to figure out how I managed to time travel and jump to a parallel universe to a place where Slender is popular and they actually had the initiative to make this while it was relevant without realising.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman? More like long googly arm
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is a dead meme lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Count all the clichés.....




Another shitty movie I fear."
ySy8mcceTno,"PLEASE, NO, ALIENS."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a rip off of the ring
ySy8mcceTno,Lol they finally made a movie bout slendy now. 😂 i hope its not shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,"hater's gonna hate but i""d still watch this at the theaters if this gets released"
ySy8mcceTno,Aaaaaaand we're off to a pretty shite start to the year..
ySy8mcceTno,Looking like Marble Hornets will be better. :/ Still gonna give it a watch though.
ySy8mcceTno,I thought they were going to follow the video game where you look for someone missing with a camera. Where's the paper? Where's the drum sounds? Where's the static?
ySy8mcceTno,Esa si no me la esperaba :)
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah yes, cheap jumpscare bog standard B horror movie man. Just what we needed.

Why couldn't they just make an actually good movie again?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ur like four years too late bud
ySy8mcceTno,We thought the Fidget Spinner Movie would be the next worst SONY idea.
ySy8mcceTno,Vuuu
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn't anyone remember that girl that was stabbed by her ""friends"" who tried to sacrifice her to slenderman? How can they make a movie about this now?"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t it late to be making a slender man movie? 🧐
ySy8mcceTno,Welp. They finally did it.
ySy8mcceTno,What ENDERMAN? XD
ySy8mcceTno,I got this on a preroll ad. YouTube can you stop looking through my video history from 8 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Goshdammit! This seems to be more about the terrifying effects Slenderman has on people and less about him. Sigh...if they wanna do a movie about this ancient Daemon, then try using the GAMES as a base and go from there. Slenderman is a monster not a psychological and mental problem. Geez...I just hope they make the Five Nights at Freddy's Movie better than this."
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly though, I hope they stick to the original reason why slender man is scary, he doesn’t rely on cheap jump scares to insight fear but rather a sense of anxiety, like he is coming, you don’t know when or where but you know he’s there."
ySy8mcceTno,"Can someone just make a classic slasher flick?
I have a feeling those would do better than a modern day cliche horror movie, like horror movies nowadays are lame and the deaths and kills are getting more and more lame and offscreen, the friday the 13th and halloween franchise has amazing on-screen kills unlike modern day horror movies"
ySy8mcceTno,I’ll watch the movie ... unless slender man commands otherwise
ySy8mcceTno,How's it going bros...
ySy8mcceTno,"it honestly doesn't feel like the slenderman at all.

It just feels like the cliche typical horror movie
-little girls
-little girls go emo
-little girls get possessed
-adults die
-little girls get taken away by the demonic creature."
ySy8mcceTno,"SONY pictures.

what a surprise."
ySy8mcceTno,Ok great! NOW WHERE'S MY FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S MOVIE!!! WITH MARKIPLIER HAVING A ROLE OR CAMEO!
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderguy will sho u de wae
ySy8mcceTno,Where PewDiePie?
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully the movie is better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,Bit late I feel like this should’ve been made years ago
ySy8mcceTno,This is setting up the Jeff the Killer / Sonic.exe cinematic universe
ySy8mcceTno,Who else remembers when those 2  girls nearly killed their best friend  over slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,The emoji movie rebooted
ySy8mcceTno,try said Candy Man in front of a mirror 5 times
ySy8mcceTno,I will sue all of you
ySy8mcceTno,"The game is so much better yhan this, this did not spook me one bit, i dont this is gonna me scary at all if not just dumb and sad. Although probably did take lots of work to do it so ill give them that."
ySy8mcceTno,Maricruz tiene SIDA checate salvadoreno
ySy8mcceTno,Roblox horror the movie
ySy8mcceTno,*Jeff the killer is next once they run out of ideas again*
ySy8mcceTno,is this fake?
ySy8mcceTno,It looks too scary! ToT
ySy8mcceTno,I've loved creepypastas since the 6th and I just remember slenderman being such a classic creepypasta so I'm going to enjoy this movie no matter what anyone says.
ySy8mcceTno,dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,"If mc isnt an overweight girl who has never run for more than 5 seconds in her entire life and for whatever reason has a camera that dies faster than my last relationship, i call bullshit."
ySy8mcceTno,"All the sheep comments saying ""err durr, 5 years late, err durr""

I'm pretty sure ya won't be saying the same thing if it was titled something else.

The first book, Game of Thrones, came out in 1996, while the first season came out on HBO 15 years later in 2011. 

The first Harry Potter came out in 1997, while the first movie came out in 2001.

Trailer looks good compared to the cheap modern thrillers out now, and it will make money."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 5 years too late. . .
ySy8mcceTno,You are about 5 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Is this 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh ma gad?! Whot?
ySy8mcceTno,i know it’s the trailer but i’m hoping he gets more screen time than what has been shown like another boba fett lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Why the only black girl have to die in the trailer though
ySy8mcceTno,Dan Howell would love this
ySy8mcceTno,"1:55 sounds like Dr.disrespect saying ""RRAULLLLL"""
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 4 years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,I've played the game for years can't wait for this to come out!
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh wut is dis
ySy8mcceTno,I'm at school and my house is next to a forest. Guess I'm staying for literature! :D
ySy8mcceTno,"Congratulations, you’re about seven years late"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Congratulations you were six years late better late than never though 😂
ySy8mcceTno,is it me or is this trailer cut together really weirdly
ySy8mcceTno,La verdad esperaba más :v
ySy8mcceTno,Alright
ySy8mcceTno,lol slender man was popular like 7 years ago what is this
ySy8mcceTno,i cant wait to see that movie :D
ySy8mcceTno,I dont know how i feel about this
ySy8mcceTno,From Creepypasta to movie. Great job Slendy.
ySy8mcceTno,"Me agrada, no lo niego, pero reconozco que el fuerte de Slender Man cuando se hizo videojuego, era el terror psicológico, también en el caso del creepypasta, obviamente.
Esta película se enfoca en el terror (físico) más que el psicológico, aún así tiene gran expectativa."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender died out years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is 5 years too late, lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Six years late
ySy8mcceTno,How does any of this have to do with slenderman??
ySy8mcceTno,Does he know de wey
ySy8mcceTno,"Reee :'D

So we were at the regal cinema and then I find  the poster, so I made my sister take a picture and It was showing what he looked like, so slender man... U can't look at him right? So we take the picture and I say, FOOL UR DOING NOTHING RN."
ySy8mcceTno,Será cierto? :V
ySy8mcceTno,hopefully its good and not trash.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real??
ySy8mcceTno,But will we see him dance to 'Gimmie 20 Dollars?
ySy8mcceTno,I think it should have been a better idea to make a movie based on the Slender Man stabbing that recently happened. It would have made for a more interesting story.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,*I've been waiting too long for this <3*
ySy8mcceTno,"*weird, jarring noise*
*text comes on screen*
~Go to Sleep~

ySy8mcceTno,LOL.
ySy8mcceTno,El tren del mame ya pasó

ySy8mcceTno,Those 26k dislikes are probably people who got scared
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,I like slender man but i dont know about this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: wait, what? This, this is real?? Ah, AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA"
ySy8mcceTno,Ha gay
ySy8mcceTno,When that girl stabed her self in the head a rock got trown at my head
ySy8mcceTno,*TENTACLE MONSTER* oh noo watch out everybody
ySy8mcceTno,Que miedo va estar esta peli del personaje mas prron de los creepy :v Slender paus solo falta Jeff The Kyller ;´v
ySy8mcceTno,incoherent af
ySy8mcceTno,finally they made it
ySy8mcceTno,It took them so long to make this movie and now there releasing it when slender man is dead
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, this looks good. But why take a creepypasta and turn it into a movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dang this movie actually looks pretty good. After all, Sony is the same company that created the Emoji Movie."
ySy8mcceTno,5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,this is the biggest movie disappointment  in a long time congrats hope ur happy sony
ySy8mcceTno,"The Slender Man trailer but every time they fail to try referencing the actual character it gets slower.
1:56:43"
ySy8mcceTno,"Im a Netflix and Chill Man myself

Edit: This is probably going to be as bad as The Snowman Killer"
ySy8mcceTno,"And it was made by 
Socialy
Online 
New 
Yorkers"
ySy8mcceTno,They should have made this back when he was relivent
ySy8mcceTno,"I doesn’t really seem like it integrates any part of Slender Man lore either. Then again, it is just a teaser trailer, but it didn’t even reference the whole “kids going missing is, like, his ‘thing’.”"
ySy8mcceTno,In her Twitter you announcement what this movie it's coming on 11th March
ySy8mcceTno,"Roses are red

Violets are blue


I'll save my money for boss baby 2"
ySy8mcceTno,wtFFFFFFFFFFFFF HAHAHAHAHAH SO CRINGE !!!!! XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
ySy8mcceTno,All I see is negative comments. . . you try making a good movie and then talk. . . is just a movie. . .
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this is gonna bad lol
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like complete garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Finally... I am waiting so Michael years for this movie! I think this movie will be cool...
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks like garbage, hollywood just cant internet....."
ySy8mcceTno,"Can't wait to see The SCP Foundation movie in 2020. Oh, or maybe, a 3D animated Sonic.exe movie, or even the live-action version of Squidward's Suicide."
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy pasta turned to a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Yo this honestly shouldnt have been made u remember that case where two girls took their friend into the woods and stabbed her 19 times......
ySy8mcceTno,*R E T U R N O F T H I C C T O S T I C C*
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't even have that much to do with slender man😂
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how Victor Surge feels about this
ySy8mcceTno,"I wish Sony would've made an Emoji Movie/Slenderman crossover movie, that would have been way better"
ySy8mcceTno,This is the single blandest movie trailer I've ever seen. I can't even say it's going to be a bad Slender Man movie because it has NOTHING to do with Slender Man!
ySy8mcceTno,I don't get it if Sony is out of ideas then go help out the Marvel Infinity War movie
ySy8mcceTno,Surprisingly not FNaF which would get them a lot more money.
ySy8mcceTno,Y Slenderman??
ySy8mcceTno,0:02 paused the video right there. I’m done.
ySy8mcceTno,Espera van sacar una peli de slender no suena mal pero almenos añadan a cosas especiales como que el unico que lo puede derrotar es su hermano splendor man traduced: a movie of slender not so bad but add something special the unic with the power to defeat slender is his brother splendor man
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like the edgiest art project ever.
ySy8mcceTno,IS THIS REAL?!this is a thing??i freaking love slendy!hes epic
ySy8mcceTno,i think this boat already left shore
ySy8mcceTno,Is this ligit?
ySy8mcceTno,Pero cuantos likes
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, Slendy is coming to the big screen. So,............When is Freddy Fazbear and his friends coming?"
ySy8mcceTno,"the trailer alone has Bye Bye Man feels all over it.. 😒


hope I'm wrong tho."
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s an interesting idea for a movie but, first off, it doesn’t look good at all. Second, after the real life attempted murder described in Beware the Slender Man, I don’t think I have the stomach for it."
ySy8mcceTno,Bad.
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/JJw0WCSsvjU
ySy8mcceTno,Is this true
ySy8mcceTno,He’s not real or is he? :O
ySy8mcceTno,There's no story to be told... You look at him for too long and he just kills you. Idk how canon worms and zombies are
ySy8mcceTno,"why
just
why"
ySy8mcceTno,grading needs serious work. was the cinemography that bad to begin with?
ySy8mcceTno,Is anyone else interested of what's in the girls hands at the end
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, but why though?"
ySy8mcceTno,Should’ve done it when it was actually scary
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean yeah it's late, but maybe just maybe.. the movie will be a good watch. 13 year old me would love to see it"
ySy8mcceTno,Wait whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
ySy8mcceTno,Kk
ySy8mcceTno,Sony whyyy are you trying to ruin everything first emoji but nobody cares but why slender man make original content
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman isn't even the one who won the creepypasta contest. Why is he so popular when he isn't the least bit scary?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender bosta q lixo
ySy8mcceTno,This could be a TV show
ySy8mcceTno,nah ... this already seem to be a little like pennywise too like a little disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,*Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Kinky...
ySy8mcceTno,Omg its finally here!!
ySy8mcceTno,This movie makes me want to drink myself
ySy8mcceTno,little late for that
ySy8mcceTno,Guat
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que no la vallan arruinar
ySy8mcceTno,From the people who brought you the emoji movie.
ySy8mcceTno,*wipes away tear*
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda want this movie to be at least decent but I know it gonna be completely terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"Its kinda concerning how long this trailer is especially considering that they don't even have a set date for this? Why is this trailer so long??? I feel like I just watched the whole movie. Why not just have a teaser? It wouldn't take a lot to get people interested considering how well known the character is. I dont even know any of these kids and I already know exactly what's going to happen. The boy will jump off the building, the girl stabs herself in the eye or whatever, the blond gets caught by slender. Like guys we'll remember this going into the theater. Any sort of weight or even shock factor any of the shots may or may not have had is now lost. Even if they where all dream sequences or hallucinations a lot was ruined thanks to your first trailer that has no business being nearly 3 minutes long???? Im just upset becuase we could have at least pretended for a short while that this is a cool movie."
ySy8mcceTno,The box office is going to meme this movie I mean it comes out a week after the avengers and two weeks before deadpool 2
ySy8mcceTno,Wow its literally just Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,"Think about how bad this is, it's made by the same people who made the emoji movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This is a movie made by people who have absolutely no idea what the creepypasta was about.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes!
ySy8mcceTno,They're a little late
ySy8mcceTno,"Omg Sony you just earned the title of best memed movie of 2018.
lol like the comment if you agree."
ySy8mcceTno,"Lots of random gnarly images to invoke horror. It looks like ""The Ring"" mixed with 5 other horror movies."
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, remember when this game was actually popular? Yeah, that was about 8 years ago...hahahahahahahahaha..."
ySy8mcceTno,Give it a few months before youtubers start doing stuff like “CALLING SLENDERMAN (NOT CLICKBAIT)!!”
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks terrible, i bet the whole movie will barely feature slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,Shouldn’t they have made this movie like 5 years ago?😂
ySy8mcceTno,Poroduscan una pelicula de jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Sony... you’re about half a decade late.
ySy8mcceTno,Whats in her hand?
ySy8mcceTno,Where's five nights at Freddy's the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Hey look something that might have potential.... if it was made 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow 108k likes. It must be made out of Quotive/Fanfic readers and writers.
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't this die like years ago......?
ySy8mcceTno,if they go wrong with this video game movie i dont kow wat to believe in anymore but true shitty game for a shitty movie wats next tetras mines in one
ySy8mcceTno,Um... slenderman was relevant like 6 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,NOPE.
ySy8mcceTno,marble hornets anyone
ySy8mcceTno,"Remind what maggots, sharp objects, stabbing people, or girls with the Ring girl's hair have to do with Slender, please. And since we're talking Slender here, where the hell are the cameras or phones, or any electronic device? A dramatic camera NOISE doesn't count."
ySy8mcceTno,STOP
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the story on how the 2 girls went murder happy?
ySy8mcceTno,Rea
ySy8mcceTno,PS4 company
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one that thinks nothing can top the emoji movie in terms of bad? This movie is going to be bad but at least they can’t turn it into 70% ads like they did with the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Shall be a true masterpiece.
ySy8mcceTno,At 0:21 you can see Logan Paul in the background finding a dead body.
ySy8mcceTno,A few years too late but ok fine
ySy8mcceTno,I can only hope that they keep him in his suit instead of him being some malformed being.
ySy8mcceTno,I would have been hyped for this movie 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"I expect nothing, and I'm still let down."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to see the movie
ySy8mcceTno,and on 2018's list of things-nobody-asked-for-or-wanted.... v.v
ySy8mcceTno,Ya quiero verla!! ^W^♥
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone is all salty tbh I’m hyped to see how funny this will be 😂
ySy8mcceTno,What Warfare
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuys.
ySy8mcceTno,"So you mean to tell me Slenderman is in the trailer for 1 second, and yet its his shadow"
ySy8mcceTno,Próximamente. ...Dear David. .
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know what's worse.  The fact that it came out like 6 years late, the fact that this is coming out after those girls committing murder to 'praise' him, or the fact that we all know that it's going to be trash."
ySy8mcceTno,Show me the way to the tipods
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it has good potential..
ySy8mcceTno,Your like 6 years late bud
ySy8mcceTno,Call to ghostbusters
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if Logan Paul will show all the dead bodies in the forest🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Nope.
ySy8mcceTno,I though this was a joke LOL
ySy8mcceTno,I though this was a joke LOL
ySy8mcceTno,"Roses are red
Chocolates are brown
I expect nothing
And I’m still let down"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the new one that's supposed to come out or a old slender man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like crap probs won't even follow the lore of slender man. Probs won't even have the pages.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when I was scared of slenderman. I was 8
ySy8mcceTno,This will ruin the Slenderman character
ySy8mcceTno,MY BODY IS READY
ySy8mcceTno,I guess they trying to bring a dead creepy pasta back to life
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m going to watch this, when it comes out"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm Sony pictures look at me I'm hip and cool! I know about the new, hip, and FREAKY horror games and were going to make a movie on the slender mans!!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Y el objetivo es recolectar las 8 páginas? :v O que?

ySy8mcceTno,"Im not gonna lie, it sounds stupid too, but I'm actually excited for this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,I actually want to watch this for some reason.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I'm watching this alone. My cousin told me about him and I was Freaking scared
ySy8mcceTno,"This isn't even going to be related to Marble Hornets, is it?"
ySy8mcceTno,Esto ya es 100% real no fake
ySy8mcceTno,"Every one trash talkers about this but I think it looks good,don't give up on this movies Sony it might be great and it is not tasteless it is just fine,and even if it is crap people should give it a chance"
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf they are really making a movie out of this? Okay I am speechless
ySy8mcceTno,"Every one hates in comments, *DOES THREE TIMES BETTER THAN IT*"
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda lame since some little kid got stabbed dozens of times over this crap. Can we say lawsuit?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony Presents

ySy8mcceTno,"6 years ago I was terrified of slendy but after 3 years of wanting a slender movie and every tall person I know dressing as him for Halloween, he became a joke and so did the idea of a slender movie this is FAR too late"

ySy8mcceTno,Sony it's not April yet
ySy8mcceTno,The memes might be coming in FAST
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait for the Slender Man movie!... said no one ever.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman and Fnaf are getting a movie...maybe Jesus does love me.
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for this film to fail.

To a whole movie"

ySy8mcceTno,"Oh no
El hombre anoréxico"
ySy8mcceTno,Yesssssssssss I'm gonna have nightmares for years
ySy8mcceTno,this trailer has the worst audio editing I've ever seen. why does the marker on glass make the sound of a marker on paper?
ySy8mcceTno,Is it coming in 2018 or 2019 please reply me
ySy8mcceTno,"Should’ve been made at the time when slender man was actually popular, imagine how much bank it would’ve made"
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe there were fan made trailers of their made up Slender Man movie now this
ySy8mcceTno,this is so dumb wtf

ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah buddy! I'll give y'all a shot, haven't had a good thrum of terror run through me since that one bad trip."
ySy8mcceTno,"Shame on you Sony.  Real living, flesh and blood children have suffered from this Slender Man crap.  One nearly died.  And it is entirely possible that there have been murders that have yet to be uncovered relating to this garbage. Then it was just a story.  Now you choose to perpetuate this idea, and therefore the real horror with it."
ySy8mcceTno,High schoolers could do it better
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this trailer so good idk but im hella looking forward to this movie
ySy8mcceTno,so many books to choose from to make movies and they use a fucking creepy pasta this is what happens when everyone is raping one another
ySy8mcceTno,You're like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Might as well give Slenderman $20
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is a comedy?
ySy8mcceTno,Esta es la mierda más épica y esperada
ySy8mcceTno,Sony please make Slendrina movie too
ySy8mcceTno,i feel like jeff the killer would be better than this sorry sony not bad but not excepted

ySy8mcceTno,Solo las ratas la van ir haber
ySy8mcceTno,LOGAN PAUL COMMENTED ON MY RECENT UPLOAD😱😭
ySy8mcceTno,But does he know da way?

ySy8mcceTno,Finally!
ySy8mcceTno,if  this doesnt come out im going to be one salty mcdonalds fry
ySy8mcceTno,This seems so wack.
ySy8mcceTno,I completely forgot Slender was a thing for like 3 years now until this movie came out. Jesus.
ySy8mcceTno,"if it wasn't based on a long dead creepypasta, this trailer would've at least mildly piqued my interest"
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepypasta Fans

      *U n i t e*"
ySy8mcceTno,I like this trailer but the problem is that the creaters got the story wrong. Not all wrong but most of it. At least it's very addicting to watch the real move soon.(*^_^*)
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,I'm tired of seeing some paranormal sh*t movies can we get another slasher horror films???
ySy8mcceTno,miss me with that faceless bs
ySy8mcceTno,Me quieren ver la cara de estúpida
ySy8mcceTno,So it’s more scary than IT
ySy8mcceTno,Will slenderman the movie be rated pg-13 or rated r?
ySy8mcceTno,WAAAAAAH
ySy8mcceTno,Pretty trash to me fam

ySy8mcceTno,"Didn't 2 girls ""sacrifice"" a girl to him over this"
ySy8mcceTno,Not interested in the movie... but this inspired me to make my wife play the game XD it was pretty hilarious. Video on my channel :) thumb up
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this movie is going to be as terrible as It was.
ySy8mcceTno,Yea this is 100% a money laundering scheme by Sony
ySy8mcceTno,weirdest spider man trailer ever
ySy8mcceTno,I’m actually impressed this wasn’t fake or fan made it’s a legit thing just...wow
ySy8mcceTno,What's next hello neighbor my god
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they do him well by this. looks good so far
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next Jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,It looks bad :v
ySy8mcceTno,"the seen where slender is standin far away from the tree is so bad, she shouldn have looked around the corner again and seen him stand closer and not just grabbed for her"
ySy8mcceTno,1:44 When I realized the suit in the background... 😱
ySy8mcceTno,Hello
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks crappy, and it'll most likely be crappy."
ySy8mcceTno,they're like....5 years too late haha
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next five nights at emojis?
ySy8mcceTno,It dont look to good
ySy8mcceTno,y'all are about 4 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"I was hoping this would be about kids getting stalked in woods are something, you know, like the game."
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know rick....
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next Jeff The Killer?
ySy8mcceTno,I FVCKING KNEW IT
ySy8mcceTno,stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, Sony, you're 5 years too late! This going to another Ghostbusters type film"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks truly horrible
ySy8mcceTno,"We don't need that, we need Emoji movie 2"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a pile of shite and a complete desecration of the character
ySy8mcceTno,"I have questions on this trailer
Where's Slenderman?
When will this come out?
Where are the black people?
Is this masked Freddy Krueger?
Does Slendy speak?
Will they tell their parents and they will not be believed

I used to be sooo scared of Slenderman but now I'm questioning myself
It would've been better to use the game edition than the original in my opinion
i saw this last night and skipped this trailer cz i thought it was gon be scary but tht was a waste"
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, I'm just glad they got Javier Botet to play Slendy. #slenderroles"
ySy8mcceTno,"Everyone get ready, the edgy 12 year olds are coming :s"
ySy8mcceTno,TOO LATE GUYS
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is barely in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"I was excited to see this at first, but after reading all the comments, I'm not sure"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you have to be bull-shitting us right now.
ySy8mcceTno,Cant the original creator of slender man sue?
ySy8mcceTno,*When it's time to stop*
ySy8mcceTno,this has a lot of potential to be good. and bad.
ySy8mcceTno,to the people who actually had high expectations for this sorry excuse of a film: im sorry
ySy8mcceTno,been waiting for a slender man movie its about time am I right
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t follow the original slender man plot at all… smh
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FINALLY!!!!! A SLENDER MAN MOVIE!!
ySy8mcceTno,"""Hey do you guys think we can ruin the Slender Man internet mythos but also make a couple dollars?""
""Yeah I think we can plunge it into ruin and capitalize on it."""
ySy8mcceTno,"Regardless of whether or not this sucks i still think that we should be glad that there is finally a official movie, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is garbage, not at all what i expect from SlenderMan in “real life”. But okay Sony, you do you."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope and will make a movie of Jeff The Killer :)
ySy8mcceTno,Tf is dis Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer doesn't make sense
ySy8mcceTno,I thought we asked for The Emoji Movie 2
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope that i don’t have to shoot up the theathers were this is shown
ySy8mcceTno,BEST MOVIE EVER
ySy8mcceTno,I seen two slenderman movies that are good.
ySy8mcceTno,Did they pay Eric Knudsen for this?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony is fucking dead, they're out of ideas."
ySy8mcceTno,Escucha Mi Contenido En El Canal ! Dejame Saber Si Te Gustó Algunas De Mis Canciones
ySy8mcceTno,Wait a minute wasn't it someone's son that went missing? Or is this based of that one awful attack?
ySy8mcceTno,"If this came out in 2013, great job"
ySy8mcceTno,Lol what
ySy8mcceTno,Love this new episode of R.L Stine the Haunting Hour.
ySy8mcceTno,"ahh the meme of 2018
*sigh*
 *Here it comes again...*"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like they were aiming for straight to DVD. This movie’s gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,So does anyone know if Marble Hornets gets royalties?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is in poor taste. Kids have murdered over the mythos.
ySy8mcceTno,I want him to be behind Randy Orton so he can RKO Him out of nowhere
ySy8mcceTno,B A D   M O V I E
ySy8mcceTno,.... And all this from a creepy pasta and a game.... welp can't be that bad *says sarcastically* welp can't put a opinion on it till I see it
ySy8mcceTno,Yyyeeesss!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"All the top comments hating on the movie and trailer, I'm actually kinda stoked about this."
ySy8mcceTno,OMfg
ySy8mcceTno,"wow slenderman was just a internet thing, and that internet made everyone crazy like that one girl who killed her friend because slenderman did y'all see it on the news it's very old like years back and some fake fan made movie trailers and fake sighting but I was surprised they actually made a REAL trailer which is this one :o"
ySy8mcceTno,2018 starts off *G O O D*
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is the reason why I love horror so you know this trailer is like my calling
ySy8mcceTno,This might actually be a good movie so why hate on it
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like it's going to have worse editing than Suicide squad lol
ySy8mcceTno,Yee
ySy8mcceTno,Sony looks like they have redeemed them selves after the emojis. they also get in your head.
ySy8mcceTno,"I saw this trailer, and wanted a movie about Slenderman. What is he, where does he come from. These are questions that the movie might not have answered anyway, but this movie is about mental health and ppl going crazy, not horror"
ySy8mcceTno,you  guys should watch tribe twelve or every man hybrid or dark harvest
ySy8mcceTno,Bootleg games be like:
ySy8mcceTno,This is on my 2018 movie list
ySy8mcceTno,What audience is this made for?
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this real, if so i want to se it"
ySy8mcceTno,Made by the same company who made the emoji movie btw
ySy8mcceTno,Yass I have been waiting for a slenderman movie !
ySy8mcceTno,He'll nawwwww to the no no no 
ySy8mcceTno,"Look, white guy wit mask know Dey wey"
ySy8mcceTno,I like how Hollywood makes movies of things that was relevant like years ago and think they’re following the latest trends and stuff.
ySy8mcceTno,Well this looks terrible. It's for sure gonna be a flop.
ySy8mcceTno,Come on Sony you're better than this
ySy8mcceTno,There's no chance in hell this movie will suck right?
ySy8mcceTno,Why is everyone in the comments pissed
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t this slender man bullshit die along time ago. Why is it being revived
ySy8mcceTno,Let it die.
ySy8mcceTno,no fat
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly truely didn't think this was gonna happen...
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally the movie is actually made, took em long enough"
ySy8mcceTno,Not late at all......
ySy8mcceTno,Who thinks they'll completely miss what made Slenderman what he is and reduce him to cheap jumpscares? I mean this is Sony we are talking about.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman died 5 years ago this won't get much
ySy8mcceTno,Lol 😂
ySy8mcceTno,"10 years later:

Sony presents



UGANDAN KNUCKLES THE MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,this is te wae
ySy8mcceTno,Instead of being negative about it im going to hope it will be a good horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,finally the movie of my favorite crepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,When does it come out? I want to go see this movie now :)
ySy8mcceTno,Sony do know da way to make slenda ma movie
ySy8mcceTno,9 years late m8. So many idiots in the comment section that only played the  game and didn't read the creepypasta.
ySy8mcceTno,FIGATA
ySy8mcceTno,Hey look another horror movie with a crazy white girl as the protagonist what a surprise
ySy8mcceTno,Hani yiğit abimiz bunu öldürmüştü amk
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, ur like 6 years late"
ySy8mcceTno,"Right when slender was the fidgit spinner back then, they decide to create a movie now when people forgot who he is now.."
ySy8mcceTno,After this : Minecraft the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks *nothing* like the game, better not disappoint."
ySy8mcceTno,"STOP. STOP IT. STOP DOING THIS.
THIS DOESNT NEED A MOVIE! AND DEFININTLY NOT ONE BY SONY FUCKIN PICTURES."
ySy8mcceTno,Are they going to add any of slenderman's proxies like Kate or Charlie
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,"Took them SIX years and it's still gonna suck. It looks like every typical horror movie, added together. Also looks like a bent Rings. Well, Rings seems to be better, and that movie was at MOST half decent. Slenderman was my favorite creepypasta, too... how disappointing..."
ySy8mcceTno,Slendytubbies
ySy8mcceTno,And here I thought slender man is now dead but boi was I wrong
ySy8mcceTno,"Huh...sooo what they gonna bring in all the creepy pastas, Jeff the killer? laughing Jack? 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,Does not look good
ySy8mcceTno,FSK?
ySy8mcceTno,"I think stuff like this shouldn't be turned into movies, creepypasta world will never fit in movies. It just destroy the characters completely and makes it see really really bad (not to mention Slender Man has been overused way too much already)."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wanna know something?






The baby that’s laughing in the end is from a baby remix."
ySy8mcceTno,They better find them pages
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think Sony knows what slenderman is
ySy8mcceTno,Estou sem palavras 😶😶.Mas é pika👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,DONT GIVE HIM $20
ySy8mcceTno,Rarely does Sony ever push out decent films. This is not one of those decent films judging by the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,I am a creepypasta fan so I will watch it see if they do it right if not I will be very disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,I waited years for this
ySy8mcceTno,I think we’re a little too late with this movie guys
ySy8mcceTno,when you realise this is from the same people who made the emoji movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol gonna be best movie ever
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t the whole slender man hype die down years ago come on Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Finally! The most anticipated movie of 2010!
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, just the time will say if the movie will be good (or at least decent)."
ySy8mcceTno,egh
ySy8mcceTno,Really? What has this world become??
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man gangnam style
ySy8mcceTno,"I know Slender Man has kind of come and gone, but I can't help kind of being excited for this."
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome...
ySy8mcceTno,why tho no
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 6 years too late. slenderman isn't even relevant anymore
ySy8mcceTno,"what are you doing Sony? this should stay where it belongs, in 2011"
ySy8mcceTno,And so Sony starts the creepy pasta shared universe
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember the games, they were already horrifying as they were, but making a movie based on the game, since it is very popular,  and with the creators of the Resident Evil and the Underworld Movies I wonder if it's going to be more action than Horror..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Everything has potential and I will save judgement of the movie for when it comes out. But the trailer was very boring and cliche.
 But hey, 10 bucks this is part of the Ghostbusters reboot universe."
ySy8mcceTno,First 4 seconds of this made me click of it
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t need to be a thing
ySy8mcceTno,And you hear the sounds of creepypasta fangirl/boys either happy or mad about thid
ySy8mcceTno,So upside down again?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was a fake trailer made by a fan
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!!!
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseethis
ySy8mcceTno,i want to see this wideo but im 12 years old life is brutal
ySy8mcceTno,Dont say this was fake but i actully seen slender man on the news when we were staying in a hotel for universal and my dad was watching the news and something said that a girl was kidnapped and it had slender on the picture it was freaky so he might be true u might not no?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman in my little pony.







Season 4 chapter name: pinkie apple pie"
ySy8mcceTno,DAVA JONAS
ySy8mcceTno,This is not da wae
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a remake of IT only with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,this would've been cool like 6 years ago when slender man was popular
ySy8mcceTno,Anyad ez laci ba a karban tartó lol😂
ySy8mcceTno,is this the new marble hornets season?
ySy8mcceTno,Look like The Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing like the creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Well that was terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Mad disappointed in where they’re taking it. Slender Man is a great mythological character you can really utilize to make a great horror story/movie.. I’ve been waiting for a Slender Man movie but this isn’t it.
ySy8mcceTno,:o S L E N D E R M A N   I S   BACK
ySy8mcceTno,What does this have to do with being in the woods and finding notes
ySy8mcceTno,Sinseramente el trailer me parece un asco apenas y sale slenderman cuando lo vi por primera ver pense que era un tailer falso hecho por algun fan porque estaba muy fome espero y no cagen a un gran icono del terror
ySy8mcceTno,Enderman brought to you by Minecraft
ySy8mcceTno,It's made by sony
ySy8mcceTno,looks good
ySy8mcceTno,Its years late but I'm excited for this
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see idubbbz's slenderman Gangnam style in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,oh also there is a eyeless jack movie that was apparently made in japan
ySy8mcceTno,Hi I'm obsessed with creepy pasta's
ySy8mcceTno,there is already a jeff the killer movie in the making  since last year there is a official trailer and everything
ySy8mcceTno,"Based off a creepypasta/meme/videogame. But ever since that one news story about the girls in the woods, media has taken a liking to it again. Slenderman was my childhood horror favorite. I’d see the movie for fun, not as a serious thing."
ySy8mcceTno,WHY? GOD?
ySy8mcceTno,Weird noises and flashy pictures the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not trusting Sony to handle this right.

Happened with Spider-Man, happened with emojis, and it'll happen with Slender Man.

They are gonna take this beloved pop culture icon and inject him into a generic horror film mold, and it won't be anything we haven't seen before."
ySy8mcceTno,next movie will be teletubbies the true scares
ySy8mcceTno,"The sequel will be called ""Slenderman 2: Gangnam Style"""
ySy8mcceTno,The Annoying Orange brought me here. The imagery is a ripoff of The Ring vhs tape.
ySy8mcceTno,Finaly new slender man movie i really can't wait to see it
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy af
ySy8mcceTno,Y donde esta slenderman??? Que pta estafa mi vista y like
ySy8mcceTno,Hope we get to see the man of slender some more
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que no sea la misma cagada que a echo Netflix con death note
ySy8mcceTno,"Men i really hope the movie will be great, but this trailer men idk doesn't look very very good xd"
ySy8mcceTno,this has just reached a totally new level
ySy8mcceTno,looks cheap as free TV series.
ySy8mcceTno,Ummmmmm 6 years late....... ok
ySy8mcceTno,I can see already this movie in one particular site
ySy8mcceTno,He do not know de wey
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,Pensé que era un troll
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my god
ySy8mcceTno,No la vayas a arruinar plox :v
ySy8mcceTno,E dopo tanti anni... è finalmente uscito...
ySy8mcceTno,A LITTLE LATE LIKE WTF!
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,"another video game horror movie...







im not ready for another alone in the dark"
ySy8mcceTno,At first it thought this wad fake since in 2012-13 shir load of these came out but never came true.....10 year olds wont even know what slender man is -_-
ySy8mcceTno,"A pointless attempt to turn something into money making content, sounds familiar... 🤔"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a slipknot music video
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is a stick:v
ySy8mcceTno,Who thought this was a good idea 💡 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry Sony, but leave this stuff to the professionals, like Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,A lil late but o this huh
ySy8mcceTno,Is Slender Man a superhero? lol
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the actual slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"Cant wait to play MeinCrap and fight the ""Enderman"""
ySy8mcceTno,"This should’ve been either black & white or found footage

& like four years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Fidget Spinner movie confirmed for 2019 from Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,YES YES YES! 1!
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,Oi família :)
ySy8mcceTno,"Of course Sony, the studio who brought us The Emoji Movie, greenlit this disaster. 2012 called. They want their movie back."
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna watch this movie like if you do
ySy8mcceTno,And where is slender man for more than half a second
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah I don't see slender man...dang it i really wanted to see him rub is skinny hands on random people
ySy8mcceTno,When i saw the sony logo i immediately thought of the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Leave these idiotic creepypastas. Try to do an SCP foundation movie! I like slenderman but the SCP's are way more scarier
ySy8mcceTno,Just 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,A black man stealing children now? The jokes are going too far
ySy8mcceTno,"Meanwhile, here I am waiting for Five Nights at Freddy's: The Movie 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,I think that someone erased Slender Man's face with an eraser... This looks awesome!
ySy8mcceTno,Garbage
ySy8mcceTno,This looks  god awful.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god
ySy8mcceTno,Eu sim vou assistir o filme slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"great idea executed in a TERRIBLE way,
first of all what does slenderman have to do with worms and people turning into zombies?
i feel like this movie is named slenderman because there was 1 scene of him and that's it.
jesus i hope only the trailer was like this, let's hope the movie delivers"
ySy8mcceTno,They could have made this so much better
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it'd be sony to make this ex. Emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"This is in horrible taste. I wouldn't be surprised if the parents sue, I think they should."
ySy8mcceTno,I think we can all agree that we wanted this movie six bloody years ago....
ySy8mcceTno,Alguém br 😐
ySy8mcceTno,Looks generic
ySy8mcceTno,Haaaaaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,"Has nothing to do with Slender Man, but okay"
ySy8mcceTno,sony isso e mais fake que meu irmão que nunca tive e nunca terei >:(
ySy8mcceTno,I’m gonna go ahead and call the bomb squad
ySy8mcceTno,what is this henti
ySy8mcceTno,"O meu god , this is amazing"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg it happens
ySy8mcceTno,Just give the man his 20 dollars already
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is for all the emos
ySy8mcceTno,"The way people are already judging the movie just by watching  a 2 and a half minute long trailer hurts my soul. I saw a comment saying something along the lines of this, I'm paraphrasing here but, ""why can't slenderman be in the movie more."" I mean can these people hook me up with a download to the movie? Seriously, judging the movie from the trailer is like grading a 10 page essay from the first page or giving a review on a book by reading the back cover. Could people stop being brain dead and wait until the movie is out until they give their opinion on the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Please no romance
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks bad. And I'm usually not very pessimistic when it comes to new movies.
ySy8mcceTno,just looks like boogey man finally coming out of the closet to haunt things face to face rather freaking people out by opening the closet door and staring at them
ySy8mcceTno,Oh they're making movies about long time dead internet sensations now?
ySy8mcceTno,This is not de way bruddah
ySy8mcceTno,well this looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,I think they arrived 10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Alguem br nessa porra 🇧🇷🎉😉
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,why the main character isn't a pewdiepie?
ySy8mcceTno,1:21 that dude knows how to be metal asf
ySy8mcceTno,They should bring guns and juggernaut suits to the forest
ySy8mcceTno,Díganme qué es una broma 😨 por qué si es realidad la tengo que ir a ver
ySy8mcceTno,"""This summer the slender man starring jack slenderman in slender man"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like Sony didn't actually do any research on the mythos, and just slapped a bunch of generic Boogeyman crap together."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally A Slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,"""Geez a slenderman movie i guess hollywood really is out of ideas"""
ySy8mcceTno,Algum BR?
ySy8mcceTno,en casi todo el trailer no aparesio slender
ySy8mcceTno,Aokigahara Jake Paul: The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this looks shitty
ySy8mcceTno,did they even play the game before making the movie??? Arent you supposed to collect notes or am i wrong?
ySy8mcceTno,"In my opinion I think this movie trailer is well done. I also want to day that whoever is hating on this movie needs to chill. Because y'all haven't even this movie yet, just like back in 2017 when emojii movie came out. So, let's all please be nice and respectful to one another, besides this is the internet. One more thing, if you don't like the Slenderman movie, then don't watch it !! Simple."
ySy8mcceTno,The next movie is called...THE CREEPYPASTA GANG
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf?!?! That cannot be slender man!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmmm that wasnt scary , but weird yes"
ySy8mcceTno,this is the best movie anh scary
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm only guessing the trailer was bad because slenderman is basically, avoid the monster (monsters if you include the proxies which they better) find pieces of paper and leave. Slender is an amazing horror classic but its true lore is actually pretty vague which means there isn't a whole lot of detail to use for a movie. I do hope this turns out better than we expect but maybe they should ask (if they haven't already) the real creator of slender what kind of details should be in the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala y te mato :v
ySy8mcceTno,At this point the fnaf movie looks better
ySy8mcceTno,Definition of internet explorer
ySy8mcceTno,Cool and it looks good but you're pretty fucking late man
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Gangnam Style
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this movie is only going too have slender man for like 20 minutes total.
ySy8mcceTno,"HAHAHAAhaaaa... sorry, no no, but go on. You were saying?"
ySy8mcceTno,Well that was disappointing.. Slendy deserves better!
ySy8mcceTno,Não vi nada de mais
ySy8mcceTno,"Is logan paul in this movie?
He can film dead bodies for views."
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, a Amnesia The Dark Descent movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,fin.
ySy8mcceTno,Just burn down the forest down like we do in real life.
ySy8mcceTno,hahahahaha
ySy8mcceTno,Good tráiler
ySy8mcceTno,*tooop algum br aki?*
ySy8mcceTno,Salamander man
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell took them so long ?? Wasn’t this suppose to come out like in 2014? Did they not get the funding back then or something
ySy8mcceTno,"Look at the amount of sheep in the comment section.

And yes amount of idiots that thought Slenderman acted just like he did in the games when he was just a creepypasta. This is based on the creepypasta. And it's fairly accurate. He literally got into kids' heads."
ySy8mcceTno,"Pero ésta película es sí tratará de los estragos mentales que causa Slenderman? Eso haría que solo lo viera una o a lo mucho 2 veces en toda la película, quisiera saber que como mínimo sí sea éste el buen villano que conocemos"
ySy8mcceTno,._.
ySy8mcceTno,Кто из Беларуси???
ySy8mcceTno,Spit on him bruddas
ySy8mcceTno,"Nein, Nein, Nein, Stop"
ySy8mcceTno,is this pg-13 or R-rated
ySy8mcceTno,This gave me goosebumps
ySy8mcceTno,Sally and slender man
ySy8mcceTno,That’s... Surprisingly 2013.
ySy8mcceTno,'-'
ySy8mcceTno,Omg can't wait 😍💜
ySy8mcceTno,I just hope they don’t make a sequel featuring Sexual Offenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,2013 the movie
ySy8mcceTno,nice movie
ySy8mcceTno,6.3M veiws jeez
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER TOUCHA MY SPAGHET..
ySy8mcceTno,"Something that could have been the greatest psychological horror flick of all time, with one of the most terrifying concepts...

And they're probably gonna botch it. I just hope the trailer only sucks because of the fact they're keeping the good stuff out!"
ySy8mcceTno,Git gud
ySy8mcceTno,*Brought you by the creators of the emoji movie*
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,no sis... what is u doin
ySy8mcceTno,A little late for this don’t you think?
ySy8mcceTno,Will Pewdiepie play this ?
ySy8mcceTno,When will it sow
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah my gf is more scary on her perioid
ySy8mcceTno,"M8, you are like, I don’t know, 6 years late, maybe 7"
ySy8mcceTno,"sony
Stop
Get some help
sigh..."
ySy8mcceTno,Theres already a slenderman  movie called the operator
ySy8mcceTno,Finalmente
ySy8mcceTno,"Most horror movies are bullshit & focus on one or two ideas including: "" Devil "", "" black power "", "" voodoo "" & that nonsense."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sure this movie is gonna be horrible
ySy8mcceTno,The book (creepy pasta) was better
ySy8mcceTno,"If there's ever a sequel i hope it's about the proxys, like jeff or jack"
ySy8mcceTno,Really?
ySy8mcceTno,Serio?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks interesting!
ySy8mcceTno,When did this game come out???
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol give them 5 years and they are going to come out with a ""comedy"" called ""Flappy Bird The Movie"", mark my fucking words, you saw it here first."
ySy8mcceTno,Why even make this when the hype died out years ago? It will be like Death Note (2017) everyone will watch it but it won't live up to everybody's expectation
ySy8mcceTno,Finally some RESPEC
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s kind of like stranger things, this ain’t like no OG slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,wtf...
ySy8mcceTno,E os Br em
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't care if the trailer is bad, i'm going to see this movie, i have been waiting since a long time ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Epic
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years after asking for this and slender man going out of date
Hey lets make a Slenderman movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man craze ended YEARS ago Sony no one cares anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next?
BEN DROWNED: The Movie?
SQUIDWARD'S SUICIDE: The Movie?
HEROBRINE: The Movie? (hope not, but sure there will be a lot of jokes about it).
JEFF THE KILLER: The Movie?
SMILE DOG: The Movie?
And many other creepypastas that craze ender over about, made as a movie, such as: Eyeless Jack and Sonic.EXE."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg why
ySy8mcceTno,otro fracaso de sony a su lista
ySy8mcceTno,Nooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,"I'd rather have a movie about SOMA, because Its an actual good game."
ySy8mcceTno,we all knew it would come..
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait when this comes out
ySy8mcceTno,хуита какая та
ySy8mcceTno,where is the black Suit and Red nicktie
ySy8mcceTno,Please no
ySy8mcceTno,"*Please, this is not the official trailer*"
ySy8mcceTno,"7 years since slendermam was a scary, took u guys awhile to make this"
ySy8mcceTno,I need to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this look fan made
ySy8mcceTno,They gone and fuckin done it
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing like the game
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe there are people out there that would watch this trailer and actually want to see this crap.
ySy8mcceTno,*an original story*
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly there a few years too late for this topic and gotta agree more likely gonna be gore then mental mind games and that's just sad Hollywood has all this time and money and yet that can't do there  proper research on slender man just come on now if your gonna do it do it right for Pete sakes don't disappoint the mass of slender man fan's (whatever is left of those anyway...sorry about that) heck I'm sure that fan made movies would be better this but I have hopes that this well be a destined flim so come movie try to prove us wrong and be good or at least okay
ySy8mcceTno,العربي هنا لايك

ySy8mcceTno,What next Jeff of Killer the Movie

ySy8mcceTno,Hard trash
ySy8mcceTno,AAAH WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG !! I'M SO EXCITED !
ySy8mcceTno,What? I thought this mf was a dead meme.... sony did the same mistake as ajit pie
ySy8mcceTno,If they can make a slenderman movie I want a Ugandan knuckles movie asap
ySy8mcceTno,:O
ySy8mcceTno,Aaaa süleymander reis
ySy8mcceTno,I think the girl is slendrina
ySy8mcceTno,"Yo been waiting for a while. You guys should make a comedy with all of the creepastas with Slender, Jeff, LuLu, etc.."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god why
ySy8mcceTno,Κανονιστε να το γαμησετε και αυτο το θριλερ βλακες αμερικανοι . ο slender man ειναι ενας απο τους πιο creepy χαρακτηρες που βγηκαν τα τελευταια χρονια
ySy8mcceTno,"Im really hyped about this, srew how old the story is"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg yasss
ySy8mcceTno,INB4 Sony puts Copyright strikes on the entire Marble Hornets series.
ySy8mcceTno,Even I could've directed that movie and made it better..
ySy8mcceTno,thanks i hate it
ySy8mcceTno,it feels like they showed everything in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,boring
ySy8mcceTno,*sighs for a while* there actually doing this
ySy8mcceTno,1:42 It’s a Daddy Long Legs!
ySy8mcceTno,Not scared
ySy8mcceTno,NOOOOOO!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman stoped being popular 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,oh no... this cant be happening.... no.. no... noooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,"Uh... 
Kinda late, don't ya think?"
ySy8mcceTno,i didn't even have any expectations going into this and i was still disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the herobrine horror movie next!
ySy8mcceTno,Meh the game looks better
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol, what if they turn all the classic creepypastas into movies? Like next a freaking Jeff the Killer movie. Slendy was a good creepypasta monster but the fad died in 2013.... well... then there was that kid who tried to kill her friend as a sacrifice to Slendy. I got into creepypastas after 2 weeks of fearing for my life because I thought, as an edgy 13 year old, that Slenderman was real. Then there's a kid who literally wanted to become a freaking proxy (even if that's just a thing the fandom made that's not even featured in actual creepypastas)"
ySy8mcceTno,Is This the real deal?
ySy8mcceTno,They pretty much took every horror cliche from other movies and mixed it together to try to make a decent coherent horror film. This is gonna be bad.
ySy8mcceTno,*boi*
ySy8mcceTno,faken don't
ySy8mcceTno,"Despite it being a fair while since ole slendy was still fresh in our minds, I have high hopes this will be the psychological Horror we need."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, 2018 is shaping up to be a pretty good yea-"
ySy8mcceTno,Ddlc movie next
ySy8mcceTno,WTF is this?  Its a crap

ySy8mcceTno,Ne slendermanı bu bir kere süleymander filmde suriyeli yok
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like trash it's gonna be full of the cheap scares 
Jump scares it's not even gonna be good"
ySy8mcceTno,the movie does not have the page's like the game and the trailer was not that scary but it was good my brothers said it is super scary lol
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Kill me making movie about an internet meme this is cash grab just like the emoji movie except the entire movie was a 3 hour long advertisement
ySy8mcceTno,Who is slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie is prob gonna be fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Not only is this like 6 years out of touch, but clealry you dont understand what made slenderman scary, and its not wierd imagery or children stabbing themselves in the eye... in fact slenderman in the creepypastas always takes the children alive, he just makes them disappear... This, this is not slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,2:15 me when I collected 7 pages and got killed
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks fine to me not sure why so many are doubting this film. It's a thing now, best to roll With it not question why it exists."
ySy8mcceTno,Like when you realize that Death Note was just the beginning...
ySy8mcceTno,Will there be a Jeff movie as well? 😐
ySy8mcceTno,"Because Sony movies have always been so good. Oh boy...

*sigh*"
ySy8mcceTno,Meio fraco mais eu vou assistir o filme quando lançar
ySy8mcceTno,Ooooo yeasss I’ve been waiting for this MOVIEE
ySy8mcceTno,What this movie is actually happening
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,If they make a Jeff the killer movie  im out
ySy8mcceTno,Now all we need is a five nights at Freddy’s movie
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,If yall dont stick to original story Im out
ySy8mcceTno,let me guess The God Awful FNAF movie will be 7 years too late as well?
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't think the movie is about slender it looks like its about fucked up kids, and five years too late BTW."
ySy8mcceTno,gay
ySy8mcceTno,bad movie. The slender man was rarely seen and also unclear what it looks like
ySy8mcceTno,NNNNNOOOOOOOO. DON'T BRING IT BACK
ySy8mcceTno,"This comment section is only hating the movie cause its a Sony movies, honestly I think it looks good"
ySy8mcceTno,1:49 that looked so lame
ySy8mcceTno,Phone game movies...please....whats next Flappy Birds unleased.
ySy8mcceTno,I think everyone is forgetting the trailer isn't suppose to give away the entire movie lol
ySy8mcceTno,Did a bunch of high school students film this with a potato and edit with Microsoft paint for their film class
ySy8mcceTno,New builders club features cant wait!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late and it doesn't even look good.
ySy8mcceTno,1:24 The girl writing “Hi Mark” 😂
ySy8mcceTno,First the emoji movie ans this
ySy8mcceTno,A little too late for that
ySy8mcceTno,Cómo 5 años tarde :v
ySy8mcceTno,There's nothing scary about a physically fit man.
ySy8mcceTno,where have you been for the past 6 years?
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things season 3
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah yeah cool, the trailer is cool but... Slender Man??"
ySy8mcceTno,Guess the Emoji movie WASN'T the bottom the barrel for Sony after all.
ySy8mcceTno,These 3  Minutes Was Like 10
ySy8mcceTno,Its official Slender Man is an extraterrestrial creature.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why Sony, why"
ySy8mcceTno,should make a movie out of Psychosis or The Rake
ySy8mcceTno,"I just want something thats interesting and has a puzzle to it. So at the end of the scary movie. We will all think that ""Oh my gosh! So him/her did that this whole time"""
ySy8mcceTno,I'm really too chicken to press play
ySy8mcceTno,"Omfg. The girl in bed looks like it came from stranger things when will byers was in the hospital bed and saw the shadow monster. & Have yall seen the trailer of ""truth or dare?"" Exact same thing when a girl stabbed her self because of that ""something"" made her do it. All horror movies are the same and  they keep coming with more horror movies & the more movies that keep coming the more that all of us are gonna think its not scary anymore."
ySy8mcceTno,honestly this looks complicated as hell like what? I don't get it
ySy8mcceTno,Hella scart
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm really weak when it comes to horror, and I must say... that trailer wasn't scary. It was just a bunch of gross and disturbing images. I felt more dread seeing those giant spider things in the Stranger Things season 2 trailer than at any point here. (And no, I did not watch on a phone.)"
ySy8mcceTno,Or maybe this could scare the shite out of us or it could be a disappointment you don’t which
ySy8mcceTno,Too late man
ySy8mcceTno,Who the hell even asked for this?
ySy8mcceTno,No...just no. This is a dead horse
ySy8mcceTno,"*WHEN WILL YOU LEARN, WHEN WILL YOU LEARN, THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!?*"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,I can't be the only one that knows this trailer sucks
ySy8mcceTno,"Everytime the movie is cringe it gets faster.
Movie:0:00"
ySy8mcceTno,From the people who came up with the idea of Emoji Movie: You better not mess this up
ySy8mcceTno,This gone suck
ySy8mcceTno,Every horror movie ever
ySy8mcceTno,Dis page is not da wae
ySy8mcceTno,Here comes the all white ski masks for Halloween.
ySy8mcceTno,You have to be kidding me.
ySy8mcceTno,"Just imagine slenderman behind you saying 




*its for your real estate*"
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer does not even show Slenderman once
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay so this doesn't look nearly as bad as I was expecting, even though it's way too late for Hollywood to be capitalizing on the biggest trend of 2012. 

I'm surprised and impressed that there was no static in this trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,Ok this much better then whatever tf that other slendermab movie was
ySy8mcceTno,Never going to be as good as marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry sony pictures but it just looks like the typical horror movie trash trying way too hard to be scary. If it took a first person view and had more originality id have way more interest and faith in it but even Marblehornets and Tribetwelve i find creepier and more well done than this.
ySy8mcceTno,This the type of movie to show slender man I. The last two minutes of the movie
ySy8mcceTno,much spook
ySy8mcceTno,Is this  a troll?
ySy8mcceTno,Why is there a petition to stop this movie I legitimately don't get it also just be happy it's not the fucking five nights at Freddy's movie or the fidget spinner movie
ySy8mcceTno,This was one of my fears. And now...it’s revisiting me
ySy8mcceTno,Bout time
ySy8mcceTno,Not impressed
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya es tarde, 15 años tarde >:v .jpg"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a shittier version of the bye-bye man
ySy8mcceTno,Are they going to try to build some creepy pasta cinematic universe?
ySy8mcceTno,*1...2...3...4...5....6..... YEP 6 years late*
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for this ever since I started to feel stalked
ySy8mcceTno,#can you see him
ySy8mcceTno,Finnally !!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man just wants to say hi
ySy8mcceTno,No mames que chido
ySy8mcceTno,...yay
ySy8mcceTno,He came back for the twenty dollars.
ySy8mcceTno,Jeez a Slenderman movie? I guess Hollywood really is out of ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,I actually hope this is better than we are expecting.
ySy8mcceTno,Boring
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or have horror movies lost their edge?
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good i have been waiting on this for years now
ySy8mcceTno,God I can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,-_-
ySy8mcceTno,Go back to 2012
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Five nights at Freddy's the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,ahora slender en serio haora solo falta que hagan fuckman
ySy8mcceTno,👎 👎 👎 👎
ySy8mcceTno,...(yawn)...meh
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see the movie but i feel like it will suck
ySy8mcceTno,saw this coming
ySy8mcceTno,"I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, judging by the trailer it looks like a great psychotic horror movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Next it’s gonna be Jeff the killer, Than Ticci Tobi, Than Ben Drowned, and so on.





Scary Movies >3"
ySy8mcceTno,"Just watch Marble Hornets. Its a good series, and I'm sure it's better than this movie will be"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this one doesn’t inspire stabbings.
ySy8mcceTno,This is real ???
ySy8mcceTno,Mmmmm Sony film (makes sense)
ySy8mcceTno,well looks like the movie industry is going to ruin another good thing by trying to connect to spiraling popularity ON THE INTERNET where it BELONGS
ySy8mcceTno,They decided to do this now??
ySy8mcceTno,2012 says that he wants his creepy pasta back
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff The Killer Plis  Movie Like
ySy8mcceTno,I have no idea what this is but everyone’s excited for it so I guess I should be too
ySy8mcceTno,What's next Charlie Charlie???
ySy8mcceTno,Why the generic crap??? Slender is already good enough as he is.
ySy8mcceTno,yall a bit late... just sayin the slender train kinda left the station... and derailed
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see how hard this one flops
ySy8mcceTno,Yes a slender man movie!!! I been waiting this for 6 years!!!
ySy8mcceTno,finally geeeeeeez
ySy8mcceTno,Tf is this?? Its supposed to be about slendarma he showed up once and looked nothing like him
ySy8mcceTno,Im waiting for this.
ySy8mcceTno,Up next: Five nights at Freddy's
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like trash 🚮
ySy8mcceTno,De wey to the forest
ySy8mcceTno,"looks like its gonna be a bit of a flop, and to the whole ""people dont just disappear"" line, depending on the context, yeah they do..."
ySy8mcceTno,Who wants to bet Marble Hornets will still be way better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm really hyped for this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"The only people who will watch this is hard core fanboys,fangirls,and 5 year olds."
ySy8mcceTno,"""Hey kids, look at how hip we are. Hope you all liked the emoji movie, I know my son just loves using those crazy things."" -Clueless Sony Executive"
ySy8mcceTno,6-7 years late man
ySy8mcceTno,Roblox  created slender man i hope they are getting paid for it
ySy8mcceTno,Am i the only one that thinks that this should have been found footage style like the Marble Hornet's series?
ySy8mcceTno,"well uh... my friends begged me to watch this trailer and to be honest, i was kind of disappointed. Thees way to many bug/eyestab things, the girl stabbing herself with the scalpel feels WAY too much like the EJ story (Eyeless Jack) and feels way too over the top, the girl when she saw slender was giving herself way too much, and that catchphrase... ""He gets in your head like a virus""... it feels way to cliche. Those are my thoughts, even though I've never seen a horror movie (I'm 11, i'll be open about it). Good to see almost everyone was thinking the same.  #SlenderverseWasBetter"
ySy8mcceTno,1:39 The only time you see Slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Pewds makin' a review of this everybody owo
ySy8mcceTno,I'm hyped like if u are
ySy8mcceTno,"oh, looks like based on his most famous history ""the girl and he"" ( i think this is the history name :\"
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, Doki Doki Literature Club?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ok question is this a real trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Just watch



UNDERTALE: the fanbase attacks"
ySy8mcceTno,YES MY DUDES!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony is like your dad trying to be relevant, its tastless and PATHETIC"
ySy8mcceTno,Stop sonny just stoooooop
ySy8mcceTno,Why? The Slender Man trend is dead.
ySy8mcceTno,why would you make a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,a little late don't you think sony
ySy8mcceTno,This might be the first good movie based on a video game.
ySy8mcceTno,You're doing it all rong
ySy8mcceTno,Now jeff the killer..
ySy8mcceTno,"meh, looks like itll be dumb and predictable. Probably would be scarier if it was about the actual slender attempted murder case"
ySy8mcceTno,Looking forward to it
ySy8mcceTno,espero y no sea una mierda.
ySy8mcceTno,Game made 6 years ago finally made a movie but looks dumb and outdated
ySy8mcceTno,Now let’s hope they don’t ruin Slendy for me with this movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t know... I do wanna see it, but it will probably be a mistake."
ySy8mcceTno,In a word: Meh
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks like a movie about slender man, from someone who doesnt know about slender man... also years after he was even a thing"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ese es el primo de Piter la anguila y el agente 47 
O
Yo versión calva y guera"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally.
ySy8mcceTno,"To me dis is friggin terrifying! Could we actually see some people plead for their lives while slender man slaughters there whole family?





And stahp worrying about the disease sort of nerd stuff."
ySy8mcceTno,He just wants his $20.
ySy8mcceTno,I like it
ySy8mcceTno,Why don't they just call it Skinny Man?   LOL
ySy8mcceTno,"hopefully the trailer just looks bad, and the actual film will have what made slenderman an effective monster: the paraonoia aspect, the fact he can seemingly choose when and how you see him, the fact he only approaches you the more yu know about him."
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm only 3 seconds in and that was too much for me
I'm out."
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time you showed up with with yo late behind.
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 is why we wear safety goggles kids
ySy8mcceTno,Really?? Why don't u just make Jeff the killer movie huh
ySy8mcceTno,Sigo  esperando  five  nights  at   fredys  la  pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,ABOUT TIME
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late...
ySy8mcceTno,Wow i can't believe this xD alo is 2013?
ySy8mcceTno,Miss peregrine's home for peculiar children would've been a better slender man movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This is a ripoff of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,"Jeff the killer the movie is coming out in 2019. It's about a 13 year old boy who faces bullying and becomes a serial killer. 

Wait! All of the jokes came true. A movie about something that's popular and obviously it will make a lot of money because it's popular. :v

Wow , people will do anything for money... What's next? The emoji movie?

Wait... That already came out. And by the same company... It's just terrific."
ySy8mcceTno,SMH 🤦‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,Way way to late for dis
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,A new low
ySy8mcceTno,What's everyone goin on about six years late
ySy8mcceTno,NÃO VAI PRA FLORESTA FILHA DA PUTAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for the sequel! Slender-Man: the dark knight returns
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope amnesia comes next!! Lol, the movie industry will have to resort to popular video games."
ySy8mcceTno,Good job sony only 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,llegan tarde 6 años tarde
ySy8mcceTno,"*T H E S E    P E O P L E    C R E A T E D     T H E      E M O J I     M O V I E .*


I am sorry but I can't take Sony pictures seriously anymore."
ySy8mcceTno,The king of creepypastas is back
ySy8mcceTno,I wish it was more based off the game tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell no
ySy8mcceTno,COMPLETELY unnecessary but was a good trailer until that ridiculous POV shot at 1:52
ySy8mcceTno,is this a real movie
ySy8mcceTno,NIGHTMARE FUEL!
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim?
ySy8mcceTno,The lack of sheets of paper to collect in the woods makes me sad.
ySy8mcceTno,Ah slender man one of the best creepy Pasta out there and one of the most original and scariest but I think every body can agree the first slender man movie 🤢🤢🤢
ySy8mcceTno,What about 5 Nights at Freddy’s!?
ySy8mcceTno,OH HECKS YEAH
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this is stupid as hell
ySy8mcceTno,Looks crap
ySy8mcceTno,"WHY
IS
THIS
A
THING!?"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm just here to hear the Gay Elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh. This Is the most anticipated movie of 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,"I was expecting an atmospheric forest horror, but psychological/insanity horror seems like it will work well for this beloved nightmare-child."
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell sony you are near a decade late with this creepypasta/urban legend
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh look, Sony wants to ruin another movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Should've done five nights at freddy's.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok? So where is the actual so called ""slender man""? All I saw were kids, mostly females because..... Female fucking empowerment........ Screaming, screaming, more screaming, some scenes doing nothing but crying and,..... Screaming. Best I saw of the actual Slender Man is a shadow or two"
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t see any pages and I see worms?... You’re six years late I hope you didn’t get it wrong.
ySy8mcceTno,"Me parece buena idea pero solo pido una cosa, SLENDERMAR DEBE SALIR MUCHAS VECES, no quiero que destruyan este gran personaje haciendo que apenas salga en la pelicula"
ySy8mcceTno,I can see that games are the new movies now xD
ySy8mcceTno,This is not a sign that Sony is out of ideas....it is just a sign that Sony is out of good ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn't look very good, does it. That's a shame."
ySy8mcceTno,This is all of going to say OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is the new avenger
ySy8mcceTno,"""People don't just disappear."" Umm have you watched Stranger Things?"
ySy8mcceTno,I think the trailer revealed to much.
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone wanna bet they won't follow the game story and neither the creepypastas?
ySy8mcceTno,why didn't they show slendermans face?
ySy8mcceTno,Like 5 years to late guys
ySy8mcceTno,As a huge fan of Slender Man I can already tell that the scares and story of this won't do justice to the classic video game. They tryna Hollywoodize it but went a little too far from the real concept.. I don't remember having PTSD in the game and flashes of images of worms
ySy8mcceTno,Basically the second bye bye man
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if they'll take any cues from the marble hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,Here comes the Creepypasta Movies...
ySy8mcceTno,They've turned it into something it's not.
ySy8mcceTno,"Omfg, I can't wait!"
ySy8mcceTno,Late m8
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like the Marble Hornets crew just rolled in their grave...and their not even fucking dead yet
ySy8mcceTno,W H A T
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this a thing
ySy8mcceTno,YASSSS FINALY A MOVUE ABOUT A HORROR GAME AND CREPPY PASTA
ySy8mcceTno,“Yo bro! Sony is working on another movie! It’s like we’re forgetting about that spider verse movie!”
ySy8mcceTno,All they needed to do was make a found footage boogie man movie and Sony turned this into a shitty psychological horror. This is gonna be terrible I already know for a fact its gonna be shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,The new slender man movie has no slender man only black markers and scary stock footage coming 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok so my only question is this, and this is just me not being familiar with a lot of slender lore... Why with the self mutilation? I don't remember slender man urging people to gouge their eyes out."
ySy8mcceTno,Look awesome! Can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,"It won't be scary since we already know what he looks like. Good job Sony. You were suppose to make us feel his presence in the trailers, not show us. That's is how trailers for horror films work."
ySy8mcceTno,it's like they gave him powers
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie and then we get the Slender Man and FNAF crossover movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Vai ser pesado pra poha kcttt vão criar aquele hype incrível!
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good
ySy8mcceTno,Y en donde esta el loquendo??!!
ySy8mcceTno,R u serious
ySy8mcceTno,Ya quiero ver la película estoy ansiosa
ySy8mcceTno,"Let’s be honest, we know this movie is gonna suck"
ySy8mcceTno,"Could be good, probably gonna be bad. It looks a lot like the IT remake but this has much less interesting source material. Hopefully it goes more for that psychological horror that this trailer was teasing rather than the standard teen horror but that probably won’t happen. Still a movie I’d go see for the jump scares that the games never delivered (no really the games sucked)"
ySy8mcceTno,It gets in your head i remembered the bye bye man in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,y eslenderma
ySy8mcceTno,I love horror movies sooooo much when this comes out i hope it is m rated
ySy8mcceTno,If u reading this I know u hiding in the comments
ySy8mcceTno,A surprisingly competent horror trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,The slenderman time has come and gone
ySy8mcceTno,A *taaaaaddddd* bit late
ySy8mcceTno,"since this movie is coming by the same company who made ""The emoji movie"" this Slender man movie will probably suck."
ySy8mcceTno,Long time to wait the first movie Team Fortress 2 in animation with her characters...
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't look very good.
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome Trailer Can't Wait to see the movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh come on! Has a game based movie ever been good??
ySy8mcceTno,Wow! after all this time it actually became a movie
ySy8mcceTno,a little bit to late
ySy8mcceTno,"Now a movie about the rake, will be a lot better"
ySy8mcceTno,20 pounds of nope in a 10 pound bag
ySy8mcceTno,Jajajjajaa
ySy8mcceTno,I think this movie is not gonna be good
ySy8mcceTno,my forehead hurts now
ySy8mcceTno,"Lets face it. The only ones ACTUALLY hyped are the 10-12 year olds that think he is still ""relevant"" And they, in no way in he'll are going to,watch this. Seems a little to ""bad"" or ""scary"" for a 11 year old trying to act edgy. I used to think slender man was scary and awsome, but at the time I was about 11. Its sad that they didn't take anything from the actual game to."
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys! BOOGA BOOGA!
ySy8mcceTno,Why the hell.
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,6 years of Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,And they’ve completely ruined the whole premise of slender man. Great job Sony....
ySy8mcceTno,Spaghetti man in theaters idk
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like garbage!
ySy8mcceTno,Meh slendermans a joke anyhow so I smell a flop.
ySy8mcceTno,omg guys ben drowned!!!1!
ySy8mcceTno,A movie based on a 4chan joke? Is this serious??
ySy8mcceTno,When I saw the thumb nail I thought it was a joke like my hairline
ySy8mcceTno,I was wating 6 years for this
ySy8mcceTno,Eu sou a única BR aqui?
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this isn’t a fan trailer so this might be real :D"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think this is going to make a lot of money. The people who want to see it aren't old enough to and the people who are stopped caring 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Quando vai sair o trailer dublado?
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years GODAMNIT WHY !?!?!?!?



I’m SO PISSED"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a Grudge and the Ring ripoff with the title Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,John Cena can see him but Slenderman can't XD
ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap
ySy8mcceTno,and i thought the emoji movie was bad
ySy8mcceTno,😱😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,So. WhAts it about?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this off of slender the arrival ?
ySy8mcceTno,What kinda bs
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, dont mess this up!"
ySy8mcceTno,"whoever originally came up with slender man must be really satisfied right now.



Or absolutely pissed that they likely wont see a dime of this."
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting for it since middle school.
ySy8mcceTno,well this be in theaters or dvd ?
ySy8mcceTno,"Bro, I've been needing this movie since the day I found out about Slender Man! 
But I'm not that upset about it being late. I got six years of research out of it! I'm prepared!"
ySy8mcceTno,"They should have shown slenderman like, not move, or not moving, and looking all creepy, thats what scared people in the first place!"
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone is talking about how this is gonna be bad while here I am happy that they got a actual actor to play Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man 2: No more movies after this.....
ySy8mcceTno,"cagenla cabrones,y los mato >:v"
ySy8mcceTno,"Why... just.. like why...

WHY SO MANY SLENDERMAN MOVIES!?!? 
-YOU PEOPLE ARE GOING TO KILL ME. I WANT TO WATCH IT."
ySy8mcceTno,cade os brasileiros desse caramba aqui?
ySy8mcceTno,Wow #10 on trending.
ySy8mcceTno,Ya se habían tardado xd
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer the movie 2019
ySy8mcceTno,one big fat YAWN
ySy8mcceTno,Sony hasn't stepped up their game. Slenderman was a 2012 craze. You know what we got now? We got Ugandan Knuckles as of today's craze.
ySy8mcceTno,Que mierda de tráiler aparte que se demoraron como 6 años para sacarlo vi que eslender man apareció ¿cuanto? ¿2 veces?
ySy8mcceTno,"Cannot be worst than the last Jedi, im sure about this"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man of a game now a movie
ySy8mcceTno,ive been waiting for this.
ySy8mcceTno,But thers no slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Falto El Loquendo
ySy8mcceTno,"This is the ""horror"" equivalent of the emoji movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Hell nah
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer was pretty trash. They didnt give us any information about the action. IT is a great example of a good trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Plz. Part 2 with the creppypastas
ySy8mcceTno,Omg slender man that guy I seen him 2 years ago he almost took me I was in the for 39 days
ySy8mcceTno,And the award for worst movie of 2018 goes to-
ySy8mcceTno,This is stupid im not excited for this at all
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim ...Im sure he was there in the trailer SONY.
ySy8mcceTno,i don't know. i don't think they capture the feel of slender. it looks like just another horror movie. so much potential. sad
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the proxys?
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy..this could be it, this could be the inspiration i need in order to kill myself, if this movie gets good reviews i will actually kill myself."
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm excited for it to come out but they have better put a lot of work in to it or else they will dissapoint a lot of people... Again. But as I said, Excited :)"
ySy8mcceTno,"This will be terrible, it's not even a bad trailer you can just tell it's going to be one of those movies"
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer looks boring
ySy8mcceTno,Babadook rip off
ySy8mcceTno,In 2011 I the drew 8 pages and left them in a house in eastern Colorado
ySy8mcceTno,This came out 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Still prefer Marble Hornets...
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought it was going to be these group of teens finding a page in ths woods and think it's a prank so they keep finding these other pages and then Slender Man starts to chase them and then they have to find all the pages before he kills them and when they find all the pages their safe and slender won't kill them, so that's what I thought SlenderMan was going to be like"
ySy8mcceTno,"To be honest this looks horrible and doesnt follow the game at all. Its a recreated story, new entity, different attacks; it doesnt follow anything"
ySy8mcceTno,... **gunshot**
ySy8mcceTno,I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY WE WOULD HAVE SLENDER MAN NOSTALGIA BUT HERE WE ARE OHHH GAWWD NO
ySy8mcceTno,"This actually looks like it will be a good movie. You know a lot of these ""scary"" movies, aren't scary at all."
ySy8mcceTno,Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayum
ySy8mcceTno,White wash
ySy8mcceTno,i came to the girl stabbing herself
ySy8mcceTno,God left the game...
ySy8mcceTno,*insert 6 years late common joke*
ySy8mcceTno,Who remembers the last time they tryed a Slenderman movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh not impressed
ySy8mcceTno,A slenderman movie in 2018. Way to strike the iron while it’s hot sony.
ySy8mcceTno,This is like the rings
ySy8mcceTno,Feminists be like “y is it slenderMan” TRIGGERED.
ySy8mcceTno,"If they don't cameo Markiplier, Pewdiepie ,or anybody who played the Slender games on YouTube I. Will. Cry. Unless it's a floop like the first Slenderman movie( which was made by a Youtuber I think )"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this gonna be a legit movie??
ySy8mcceTno,is this real so have been fake tell me please
ySy8mcceTno,YAAAAAAAAZ
ySy8mcceTno,There already is a Slenderman movie - Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Ahh.. cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,In may 18. You can see it.
ySy8mcceTno,Finnaly!
ySy8mcceTno,This is like making a movie about a really good Reddit comment.
ySy8mcceTno,😴😴😴😴
ySy8mcceTno,*_É DEMOROU MAS SAIU NÉ_*
ySy8mcceTno,"...okay, and? Idk it feels like the scares in this trailer are all just from tropes. Character 1 puts a hand over Character 2’s mouth while hiding, all that Jazz. I’m not a film critic pls no kill





((I keep thinking about the girl who got stabbed over this thing. I hope she’s okay with this."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like there is going to be a new meme.
ySy8mcceTno,Como maman puras pendejadas
ySy8mcceTno,pinche sony no mame espere 6 putos años no mame tampoco la cage como pixels y emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,OMG amazing my favorite creepypasta can you do a Slendytubbies Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it will be worth the wait I hope
ySy8mcceTno,wow!!!! can they make five nights at freddys or the roblox movei next???
ySy8mcceTno,NO WAY IM DREAMING SLENDER AS A MOVIE YAAAAAAASS!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Excited about the movie. Been wanting someone to try again with Slender Man ever since Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story was released. The trailer looks scary, but I am withholding judgement on the movie until it is released. I have high standards not only as a fan of Slender Man, but also as a fan of horror movies. I hope this movie will reach my expectations."
ySy8mcceTno,"You people are so annoying. So just because it was created years ago, it means that they had to have dropped a movie soon after the character premiered?? Like seriously? Come on, people. And also, this movie probably would've came out sooner, but that incident happened, which is probably why it didn't come out before now. Just enjoy the movie. Sheesh.."
ySy8mcceTno,Did they do this just for the money
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man: First Creepy Pasta to Ever get a horror movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else notice Slender standing in the woods over the red headed girls shoulder at the start of the trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,DISLIKE ACTIVED
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer seems like it has nothing to do with slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Who makes a movie about a creepypasta/horror game, what next, Jeff the killer"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo if your ganna make a movie about slender man at least show him in full depth not just the face right now it doesnt look good
ySy8mcceTno,I want more slender
ySy8mcceTno,"I swear to God the music sounds stock. Why.

On the other hand, this looks like a bit of a mindfuck. So if it turns out bad, I can say SOMETHING interesting about it. But that also means that this could have very little story structure."
ySy8mcceTno,Eh. A little late. Ive been needing a good horror movie so why not.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty awful. I’m just guessing Sony is making movies not for the enjoyment of the viewers but for the enjoyment of the company making money.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope my favorite creepy pasta isn't turned into a terrible movie tho--
ySy8mcceTno,Unlike jake paul the cops didnt find a dead body in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,1:33 when you see a toys in japan video
ySy8mcceTno,es hermosa 😍😍❤
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting too long for a slenderman movie but why did sony have to be the ones to make it this is total bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,"This new vr game looks...

ok"
ySy8mcceTno,"They're gonna make a movie about the ""dab"" next aren't they?"
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 screamer
ySy8mcceTno,this is not de wey
ySy8mcceTno,We didn’t need this.
ySy8mcceTno,Firstly mate your a BIT to late for this
ySy8mcceTno,PLEASE GOD NO!
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Too old man 6 Years
ySy8mcceTno,#slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like the ring, but I'm a huge fan of the ring so idc"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks good the part when the kid stabs herself gives me chills up my  spine
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm so pumped for that Jeff The Killer movie bois
Gonna be lit like the emoji movie lol 








Yes it's a joke."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope people know that people can't just make a movie in 1 year and be good
ySy8mcceTno,I have a feeling this movie will fail because it's a game movie and you know how those go.
ySy8mcceTno,#ICanSeeHimBiatch
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be so bad XD
ySy8mcceTno,nine inch nails could make a better trailer than this garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,"NOPE.avi intensifies

This looks terrible =/ I really hope Eric didn't actually have this happen! Didn't he say Slenderman was a nonprofit character anyway? WTF dude DX"
ySy8mcceTno,Its Rip off of Bye Bye Man and also 6 years ahead of it's time
ySy8mcceTno,Boy oh boy if slenderman doesn't have his suit I'm already done
ySy8mcceTno,If he ain't I'm a suit I ain't watching it
ySy8mcceTno,"Bit late, but this could be the way to redemption sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"I bet $1,000 that Candy Crush the movie is next"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m supposed to see this first of all on my birthday and I’m scared asf like my mom is really excited and I’m like HOLD UP! Who said I was going to see this but I guest I am.. it looks good though!😂
ySy8mcceTno,NO FUCKING WAY.....
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like I'm watching the tape from the ring. Nothing but disturbing images to make it seem worth watching. Slender Man was cool when I was younger, but come on. There are people out there with REAL good ideas for horror movies."
ySy8mcceTno,really?
ySy8mcceTno,this looks kinda bad
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see this
ySy8mcceTno,Plz come out
ySy8mcceTno,I see no slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,From the creators of The Emoji Movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,No mames que asco
ySy8mcceTno,This looks hilariously terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Sooo umm where was he I only saw him like 1 time and seriously 6 Years late . I’ve had interest in the game and stuff but now I’m like nah. Who else is like this
ySy8mcceTno,"Should've been done about 6 years ago when the hype was at its peak, surely will lose profit from it"
ySy8mcceTno,"The fact that two kids murdered someone probably caused the delay in a slender man movie, so i understand the long wait, but to me the premise seems... boring...  not interesting at all. add the fact that sony is behind it does not help. It would be better if another studio like Blumhouse were the ones making it. Lets just hope Marc Webb is not in charge, otherwise this is probably just and advertisement for the next seven movies in the CCU (Creepypasta Cinematic Universe). Actually i would like to see that."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg Finally I’ve been waiting for this I love horror movies and scary things in general I’m so excited
ySy8mcceTno,Wow A Real Slender man film
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh yay Slenderman that's what we'd needed more jumpscare movies, not like every horror movie the past 5 years have been only jumpscares. Really wish it they were going to choose a Creepy Pasta they would've chosen a better one, like Rake, or Russian Sleep Experiment, or well I just completely blanked on the names, but there are 100s of them that are better."
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be interesting...
ySy8mcceTno,This is stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't f*** this up Sony. PLEASE MAKE IT GOOD
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,Why ?
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"What next Jeff, Ben also Sony don’t actually make movies on them please"
ySy8mcceTno,and how many people waited for this???
ySy8mcceTno,this is so last year ago come on
ySy8mcceTno,and how many people waited for this???
ySy8mcceTno,and how many people waited for this???
ySy8mcceTno,Eh
ySy8mcceTno,"He gets in your head? A little off but, lets just roll with it."
ySy8mcceTno,papa marble hornets is mad
ySy8mcceTno,this seems less based on the slender creepypasta and game and more based on those two girls who tried to sacrifice their friend for slender
ySy8mcceTno,how the hell is this the slender man???
ySy8mcceTno,Sony pictures presents: Logan Paul and the Suicide Forest.
ySy8mcceTno,1:02 is she having Vietnam flashbacks
ySy8mcceTno,Soy la única en los comentarios q habla español así q adiós😦🙌🙋
ySy8mcceTno,Doesnt look like ayla at 1:34?
ySy8mcceTno,"You kinda made your bed with the Emoji Movie, Sony. People are gonna be hesitant about this."
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm curious to see what they do with this. Slenderman has always fascinated me in a strange sense, this movie is more then likely to be bad, but i'm curious."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is WAAAYYYY too late...
ySy8mcceTno,I wouldn't be surprised if they made a Jeff the killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"if they are going into creepypasta movies...they should atleast make the following
Jeff the killer
Jane the killer
Laughing Jack
Eyeless Jack
Clockwork Orange (I believe that's her name anyways)"
ySy8mcceTno,i don't think they did there research
ySy8mcceTno,Hahaha this movie is going to fail hahaha
ySy8mcceTno,A meme made into a movie who would have ever guessed it would have happen
ySy8mcceTno,They should've made this long ago. Slender man isn't even a trend
ySy8mcceTno,"I can only imagine a bunch of old men sitting around a conference table and wondering what was hip 
Except they're half a decade late and they don't actually care regardless"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy."
ySy8mcceTno,"Hold on. 
*Gets cross, speakers, large TV*





I'm ready."
ySy8mcceTno,kinda late and spelt wrong
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie doesn't just look like it's going to flop cuz it mostly will flop just because it's fuckin sony pictures that has the rights to this movie. And the trailer wasn't even appealing at all, just like ""the new mutants"" trailer. Because both trailers don't look dark and scary enough"
ySy8mcceTno,Its no like the game
ySy8mcceTno,"This deserves trending.
Logan Paul doesn’t."
ySy8mcceTno,Espero y esto se aga un universo con las demás crepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,I saw Sony and saw SlenderMan and misread it for Spider-Man lol because Marvel works with Sony to make Spider-Man lol
ySy8mcceTno,So slender man ............what happened to the fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,Then there will be Jeff the killer...😑😑😑
ySy8mcceTno,Wow nice🙂 can't wait.
ySy8mcceTno,"*new meme*




Thicc wooman vs sleenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,"Please don't suck!

Also adapt more creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,remember this guy?
ySy8mcceTno,I'm already disappointed that Slender didn't kill someone and static popped up afterwards
ySy8mcceTno,Already know that this movie isn’t going to be good.
ySy8mcceTno,Ah no mames esta en gringo ya no la veo dislike
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this meme died
ySy8mcceTno,"More fuel for the crazy girls who think he’s real, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,*You can’t C me*
ySy8mcceTno,Boi... BOI... *BOI I CANT FIND THE LAST PAGE!!!*
ySy8mcceTno,"My opinion is that no one asked for this movie, it should hav been made back I. 2011 when slender man was still big and stuff but I’m still going to go see the movie as I am a horror fan although I know nothing about horror I still just like movies so it might be good but out dated, now I don’t know much about slender man but I don’t remember there being heaps of kids straight committing suicide it seams like it would be a step too far in my opinion it still might make more sense in the full movie and speaking of making sense the trailer doesn’t make much sense with just quick cuts and not showing much at all I saw an eye being cut or something and I’m curious to see what role that plays in the story of the film so there you go I can’t think of anything else to say I’m going to watch it and hopefully I enjoy it"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:15
Well hi to you too!"
ySy8mcceTno,Because this game is recent.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I LOVE SLENDER AND NOW HES GETTING HIS OWN MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,This looks god awful
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my gosh! what a trailer TOP
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,Ol i need to see this.😛😛😛
ySy8mcceTno,Why kids go missing ummm pennywise Maby
ySy8mcceTno,scared me 💩💩💩💩😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,Are you kidding me. Does anyone remember that poor girl who suffered so much because of this? Now Hollywood will make money off of it. Wrong.
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony no offense, but you are like 5 years late for this"
ySy8mcceTno,Hi 2011 👋
ySy8mcceTno,Lol you know it’s gonna be bad if they can’t spell their own movie title right
ySy8mcceTno,1:43 The girl obviously hasn’t played the game. Dont turn you’re back on him
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like trash...
ySy8mcceTno,we don't need this.
ySy8mcceTno,We didn't see him a lot in the trailer if the movie is called slender man shouldn't we see him a lot in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,where did he leave his suit?
ySy8mcceTno,.............
ySy8mcceTno,Some nice childhood memories...
ySy8mcceTno,"Sure, why not? Id rather watch thing than another Star Wars or DC movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Here we fucking go I'm ready
ySy8mcceTno,"I see a lot of people saying game-to-movie adaptions need to stop and Sony should stop making movies, but I honestly feel like this is a movie adaptation of a game that could really work. Why exactly do I think this? Well think about it, the Slenderman games' gameplay, story, atmosphere, and genre are much different than games like Halo, Ratchet and Clank, or World of Warcraft (all game-to-movie adaptions that many fans and nearly all people unfamiliar with the games find bad, horrible, or just ok). We'll assume that this movie will be based upon the original game, Slender: The Eight Pages. Slender is a horror game where your goal is to collect eight pages before the monster known as Slenderman catches you and does whatever he does to you after he gets you. Other games like Halo (shooter) and WoW (MMO) are more complex and sometimes have written and detailed stories. You can't just spend tons of money on making a 1.5-2 hour long movie where all the people are doing the entire time is shooting enemies until they reach the boss, and then continue shooting even more. You have to give it some sort of story or plot that can be turned into a movie, which doesn't always work out with some games. The difference is Slender has simple gameplay, and not much of a ""story"" exactly. You can turn the game's mechanics and features into something with a more established story, possibly changing small things along the way. It's possibly a bit of a jump, but it's like the Lorax in my opinion. The book only features the events of the boy talking to the Onceler and him telling the story of the Lorax, it's as simple as that. Yet the movie incorporated new events, characters, and details (primarily at the beginning and end of the movie) to further build the story, and it turned out excellent in my opinion. Under no circumstances am I saying Slender Man is going to be a good movie, but I am saying if Sony executes things properly, such as getting a team of writers experienced in the horror genre, it could turn out to be a good (and maybe even great) movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Bit too late guys
ySy8mcceTno,هاي شنو كلة انكليزي😂
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is a great creepypasta but plz do more creepypasta horror movies please
ySy8mcceTno,I just cant take it seriously
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets did it first
ySy8mcceTno,Cringe
ySy8mcceTno,"Jugeing by the comments this movie is gonna fall faster than a trade center, if ya know what im sayin."
ySy8mcceTno,"You see slenderman but you can't out run him and you have three items balls,orange juice,gun,shield,pet dragon,pet worm. What would you do?"
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next FNAF?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait, is that Allahu Akbar i hear at 1:55"
ySy8mcceTno,Mi crepypasta favorito siiiii!

ySy8mcceTno,They should have made this movie back in 2011 then it might have actually attracted a lot more people
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman was poppin in like 2011 yall late af bruh
ySy8mcceTno,"_Man, this movie looks kinda bad-_"
ySy8mcceTno,"YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! Finally! The movie about The Black King! The Alpha, and The Omega! The Beginning, and The End! Our Lord and Savior! The Man who Started It All! Ladies and Gentlemen, *SLENDER MAN!*"
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next? Jeff the killer the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Ni aparece slender
ySy8mcceTno,I heard that Sony is going to make a Fidget Spinner Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,$5 says that the ending of this movie will have the actual jump scare.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is not slender, it’s a Hitchcock suicide compilation. I’m very disappointed. They turned a great psychological horror character into gore and meaningless suicide. I expected more honestly."
ySy8mcceTno,A little late but k
ySy8mcceTno,OK KIDS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS 6 YEARS BACK OFF
ySy8mcceTno,6 years later sony

ySy8mcceTno,Nope
ySy8mcceTno,Cómo que no vi bien al slenderman o es que casi no aparece en la película :v
ySy8mcceTno,hmmm i think you’re about four years too late
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp,
*Time to butcher another thing.*"
ySy8mcceTno,"I waited a year for this trailer. This movie is gonna be total garbage, isn't it?"
ySy8mcceTno,Is it bad that I'm really excited this movie is being made?!?!!?
ySy8mcceTno,Juste il faudrait  retirer man au titre et laisser seulement slender
ySy8mcceTno,We're not really doing this are we?
ySy8mcceTno,Get ready for like 25 jump scares lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Now it’s just time for a late fnaf movie.
Ps I don’t mind that it’s late as long as it’s a good movie (both this one and the fnaf one)"
ySy8mcceTno,The Legend Is Back
ySy8mcceTno,Only 6 years late good job 😭🔫

ySy8mcceTno,I don't like it it's not even scary
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this for a very long time DONT SCREW THIS UP
ySy8mcceTno,He's no that slim...
ySy8mcceTno,"I am excited for this. Always liked the Slender Man stories. He is just so dark, and creepy. And for the people who say that this movie should be cancelled, the girl didn't die, and it is just 1 incident. There are films about mass murders/genocide that people think are okay. Get over it, it's a film."
ySy8mcceTno,"Can someone say ""cliche."" Also that filter, what's with that? It's not going to make the movie any scarier, if it's even scary at all."
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING
ySy8mcceTno,"Knowing all things Slenderman, this will be great.
Knowing all things Sony, this will absolutely suck.
I...I'm conflicted..."
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been a better movie pitch about 7 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,It’s ur boi
ySy8mcceTno,Mejor has juegos déjale las películas a alguien más ok no
ySy8mcceTno,can't say it's great when the fact it is from sony
ySy8mcceTno,Cool
ySy8mcceTno,Big Budget Bye Bye Man?
ySy8mcceTno,It’s just Thon Maker chill out
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man
Play the game, see the movie. Not Rated.

The next from based on Unity3d Asset."
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was dead
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMAN WITHOUT A SUIT????
ySy8mcceTno,1:35- nut
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like a movie about The Rake would be a lot more terrifying.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the emoji movie???
ySy8mcceTno,"Here comes the moneyyyyyyyy
Here comes the money
Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money Money"
ySy8mcceTno,So where's the Slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman değil bu sülaymander
ySy8mcceTno,"Why are you making a movie about Slenderman? You should of did this back in 2013, when Slenderman was popular. You're a little late on this"
ySy8mcceTno,"If you're NOT going to tell the ABSOLUTE TRUTH about the ACTUAL story of what happened in Waukesha, Wisconsin; then you have NO STORY to tell.
Not worth a two-minute cartoon."
ySy8mcceTno,I’m just gonna go watch spirited away…
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was a fan trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger Things?
ySy8mcceTno,assassanations classroom in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,Sony wants money
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the trailer only sucked cause they weren't trying to spoil the good parts
ySy8mcceTno,I bet they're gonna make a Creepy Pasta movie series in the style of marvel because everyone's doing it now.
ySy8mcceTno,first grade this was like a thing. Not anymore tho.
ySy8mcceTno,is this real it looks so lame
ySy8mcceTno,The games were bad as they were now a movie please.
ySy8mcceTno,"and for those who may think its bad 



what if its good?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks dumb. The people who produced and written this movie are dumb. Also, anyone who thinks this looks good is dumb."
ySy8mcceTno,the least needed movie in 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Cuando tenes miedo y comenzas a ver los comentarios
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was never coming out
ySy8mcceTno,"""He gets in your head like a virus"" Most cliche sentence I heard 2018"
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this is officially the final nail in the coffin for what was once an intriguing and mysterious entity."
ySy8mcceTno,A movie about Slenderman needs to be a way more subtle than this.
ySy8mcceTno,More Sony more scare
ySy8mcceTno,YASSS I CANT WAIT UNTIL THIS MOVIE COMES OUT 🤩😜😁😁😧😧
ySy8mcceTno,stop
ySy8mcceTno,"Yayyyyy making movies bout creepy pasta i have ideas ok jeff the killer , a movie about lost episodes , smile dog , ben drowned ok now MAKE THESE MOVIES PLEASEEEEE"
ySy8mcceTno,HEY GUYS OOGA BOOGA
ySy8mcceTno,"Not entirely what I had in mind for a slender man movie. It doesn't feel the same, like I wish it took more influence from the game. Also, it's not very scary either... but it definitely does give a creepy and unsettling vibe.


I prefer something else like Jeff the Killer. That's one creepypasta that needs a movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Yessss
ySy8mcceTno,When the trailer is better then the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Would be better
ySy8mcceTno,Tem alguém do Brasil em
ySy8mcceTno,Ew I started watching this while eating 🤢😂
ySy8mcceTno,"All that's next is the venom movie :,)"
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was a fucking joke at first till I saw the channel name then I was like Jesus Christ sony stick to what you do best video games
ySy8mcceTno,*sees sony* oh...
ySy8mcceTno,"Que viajem
 é essa vei"
ySy8mcceTno,Doki doki movie next? :D
ySy8mcceTno,slender man gangnam style
ySy8mcceTno,"0:43
Life Is Strange :)"
ySy8mcceTno,No la caguen pls
ySy8mcceTno,"ok, in my opinion i feel like this movie would be better if it was like a duel. Sort of like in that small indie game from 2012, somebody wakes up in the middle of a seemingly endless forest, with no recollection whatsoever and has to find a way, out all the while, getting these visions and sightings of slender man. there could even be a part where when the main character first meets slenderman from afar you just see the slenderman moving but his legs are standing still, and it zooms in on his legs while leaves are being pushed aside but his feet aren't moving yet he's still going forward. If anyone else wants to add to this, i think it could be really interesting."
ySy8mcceTno,"who ever is making this is awful piece of crap , just years ago two girls murder there friend over this , now there making a movie of this death worshiping garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, they want their content back"
ySy8mcceTno,Is he not meant to be silent and pop out of nowhere? Don't think they captured that too well...
ySy8mcceTno,That is creepy
ySy8mcceTno,I am so excited for the movie !
ySy8mcceTno,"That is not horror. Heck, I'm easy to scare but any tension disappeared halfway through the trailer. It jumps to spoopy imagery and pople going crazy for no reason, or at least the viewer isn't made aware why.

Make no mistake, I'm sure it took some effort. The environments are nice to look at, the acting itself is surprising okay, but I have no idea in which direction they want to take this."
ySy8mcceTno,Now i have seen the whole movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhh oh no hope I don't get scared of something I used to play like 500 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Oque mais faltou foi Slender ;-,"
ySy8mcceTno,"Queridos creadores si pudieron hacer la película de Slenderman, entonces porqué no también de los otros Creepypasta ?"
ySy8mcceTno,Fooking slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Time to hide in the comments
ySy8mcceTno,Um... Kay.
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder what slender man did to her at 2:15 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,1:54 Allahu Akbar?
ySy8mcceTno,When you can't use Spider-Man
ySy8mcceTno,"so. a little less than 1/5 didn't like the trailer.
I would like to know why, because I think the trailer looks quite promising.
I think that most people probably just disliked because the Slender Man hype died a long time ago, but I see some potential with this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,"As much as a nice wholesome film this appears to be, I'm probably going to pass on this one..."
ySy8mcceTno,"if they made a slender man movie, why don’t they make a Emily wants to play movie? Or a bendy and the ink machine movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,yes!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Eu tenho que assistir essa pohaaaaaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,Are we sure this isn't a fan made compilation of clips from supernatural and high school film class projects?
ySy8mcceTno,wassup boiis
ySy8mcceTno,Is that a slender man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"He has a movie now?







This is going to be one of the very few horror movies I will watch"
ySy8mcceTno,a plot twist if they had hoodie masky and sally unless the girl is supposed to be sally
ySy8mcceTno,you know... this would've been great back in 2010
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSS FOR SOOO LONGGGGG💖💗❤️🤪😁
ySy8mcceTno,You know I would love to see this from a first  person camera view like the video games. Then we could see the static affect. But the movie has not came out yet. So this could happen maybe.....
ySy8mcceTno,*CRINGE*
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 Slender man’s ONLY SCREENTIME WITHIN THE WHOLE TRAILER WHERE YOU CAN SEE HIM FULLY
ySy8mcceTno,🎶Slenderman Slenderman all the children try to run. Slenderman Slenderman to him it's part of the fun. Slenderman Slenderman dressed in darkest suit and tie. Slenderman Slenderman you most certainly will die🎶
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer made little sense, though, its making me look behind myself even if there's a wall there. I watched this at like 3am and I'm so scared. ;-;"
ySy8mcceTno,Sangue de JESUS TEM PODER TEM PODER TEM PODER FAZ O INFERNO TREMER eo SATANÁS CORRER
ySy8mcceTno,Movie companies should really make movies out of creepy pastas
ySy8mcceTno,0:43 better than deviantart
ySy8mcceTno,I'd rather watch batman say he's gayer than Joey.
ySy8mcceTno,>2018
ySy8mcceTno,"Trailer looks garbage !
This has every dumb horror movie cliche from the shaking head really  fast to the falling down the well .
Perfect example of what every modern horror movie does wrong . Congrats sony on your flop of a new movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Please work in the play 5
ySy8mcceTno,Hype is over. Why making the Movie now?
ySy8mcceTno,what only like 7-6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully you guys don't abandon this movie for another emoji movie like what you did with the Popeye movie
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer looks like a mixture the exorcist, rings, and some kind of badly edited nature documentary"
ySy8mcceTno,This suuure looks creative and original.
ySy8mcceTno,Why don’t they call him lanky man instead of slender?
ySy8mcceTno,Omaga
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is about six years late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,"Really youre going to make a horror movie about an internet meme? This is like the emoji movie as far as im concerned. Just watch marblehornets rather than this crap, way scarier."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow didn’t know Slenderman was a Demegorgon
ySy8mcceTno,My 12 yro emo self just came out tf is this
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman sounds like a Transformers
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve waited 5 years for this
ySy8mcceTno,Not offense
ySy8mcceTno,Is much better the operator
ySy8mcceTno,Por qué no hay comentarios en español 😢 espera... El mio si lo esta 😀.
ySy8mcceTno,Employer engineering hunter standard color sentence park executive among
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t seem that good to me :/
ySy8mcceTno,NANI
ySy8mcceTno,Did you notice that Slenderman reappears right next to her?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks hilariously bad
ySy8mcceTno,"meh, I'll give it a shot"
ySy8mcceTno,When does it come out
ySy8mcceTno,Another movie from Satan... Hmph Emoji movie Hmph
ySy8mcceTno,The creepypasta fandom finally died down. Now this? Oh boy... Get ready for another wave of crazy. Gonna go the way of pennywise on Tumblr.
ySy8mcceTno,I like that this movie reminds us about the real danger of Slender Man. Like those children back in 2012 who murdered each other because they believed so much in him.
ySy8mcceTno,fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,What's more scary is the fact people actualy liked this
ySy8mcceTno,"You're a bit late to the party, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Brazil
ySy8mcceTno,ya cagaron todo!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,When have video game movies ever been bad? Right guys?
ySy8mcceTno,Are we in 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was a fan movie trailer as it looked so bad. This makes the Resident Evil movies look like Citizen Kane.
ySy8mcceTno,PG13 generic dogshit
ySy8mcceTno,It's 2018 not 2012. This movie is a little late.
ySy8mcceTno,Like jos olet suomesta
ySy8mcceTno,Ok.... or I could go watch marble hornets for free....
ySy8mcceTno,"""He gets in your head like a virus"" what now?"
ySy8mcceTno,Needs to stay in 2017
ySy8mcceTno,2018: The Year Creepypastas become mainstream (and possibly die)
ySy8mcceTno,Bring back Concrete Giraffes!
ySy8mcceTno,"I would love to see Slenderman as a movie, but more excited I am more disappointed I get... I feel like this is not even about him... And what's up with those worms and stuff?! reminds me of the ring... This creepypasta- my beloved slendy- deserves better"
ySy8mcceTno,PIMBA
ySy8mcceTno,Idk how to feel about this
ySy8mcceTno,But why tho?
ySy8mcceTno,Dead game
ySy8mcceTno,cool
ySy8mcceTno,"I didn’t think this looked half bad. Not great, but not awful. Then again, I have been horribly wrong before"
ySy8mcceTno,"Nah. If you want to watch a scary Slenderman story (in 2018, for some reason), watch the TribeTwelve series. It's awesome."
ySy8mcceTno,"lol, this movie looks funny, will take my 5 year old son to watch."
ySy8mcceTno,Did the original creators of slenderman even get paid for this? They should or sue because they've practically created the main threat of the story
ySy8mcceTno,This is a slender man .??
ySy8mcceTno,This trend died in 2010
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait...

They are talking about the actual, ( Real, but not real. Cause he is a fake character. ), the actual creepypasta Slenderman... Right? If so, is this fake? Cause that story was made 6 or 7 years ago, and yet, they did not make a movie while people kept saying he is real. They should make more CP movies. I would so watch them, although, my mom wouldn't let me lawl."
ySy8mcceTno,It was either this or fnaf I’m glad it’s this
ySy8mcceTno,Deu medo de mijar :D
ySy8mcceTno,OH NO... MY PAST COMING...
ySy8mcceTno,"please,more slendeman on THE SLENDERMAN MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,i kinda hope the make SCP Containment Breach movie instead.
ySy8mcceTno,"Flaws:
-Will not appeal to old fanbase
-Movie was made too late
-Will probably show slender for like 30 seconds
-Not really horror looks more like suspense
-looks like the exorcist of emily rose with demon possesion
- video game movie and kills the mystery of slenderman
These are the flaws I saw feel free to expand or tell me if I'm wrong."
ySy8mcceTno,Iha vitu hyvä
ySy8mcceTno,And only 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Sleeeeeeeeeeennnndyyyyyy D':
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, IT was scarier than this looked and that movie sucked"
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who thinks this trailer is a bit like stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,about time
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie about Slendermeme, cool"
ySy8mcceTno,"They better come up with a better trailer if they can, it's good but not what I entirely expected."
ySy8mcceTno,Movie about a game inspired about a creepypasta? *WHAT COULD POSSIBLY   GO WRONG?*
ySy8mcceTno,"Coming soon in 2020
Pokémon Go The movie"
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this is coming
ySy8mcceTno,"Asi amigos mios es como cagan a un creepypasta famoso con tan solo el trailer de su película. Se nota que Disney te quito a Spiderman, ¿no es asi Sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,this .. is ..real? like not a fan made trailer???
ySy8mcceTno,Make a marble hornets or every man hybrid movie
ySy8mcceTno,This film is going to be bad
ySy8mcceTno,This is sick
ySy8mcceTno,"#CanYouSeeHim
No I can't"
ySy8mcceTno,"Its 6 years late, but this one I might check out."
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah, Hell, what a surprise. Sony just over hyped my 3-year old ancient fave game. Thanks."
ySy8mcceTno,"I think this movie might be good if they did with it what i think they did with it.. i think that in this movie that slenderman isnt an actual physical monster or something, they legit say ""he gets in your head like a virus"" what if he is the virus? And the slenderman is the embodyment of the virus that the victims see when they are infected. It could be a cool twist to what the slenderman is most often thought as.. a scary monster that steals kids.. and turns it into a psycological ""its all in your head"" movie... idk, just a thought."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a fan made trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"People are not gonna watch this because of the movie itself, but because of the already existing fan base. This is looking pretty disappointing"
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/ZXE88ya8rhg
ySy8mcceTno,But slenderman is such a cutie
ySy8mcceTno,By any means
ySy8mcceTno,Nada que ver xd
ySy8mcceTno,This is not good
ySy8mcceTno,This better not be a PG-13 movie and it better show Slenderman for more than 5 minutes
ySy8mcceTno,"Muy pocas veces aparece slenderman >:(
Y ademas ese susto no dio miedo y encima no se parecia a slenderman >:(
Me gusto mas una peli que vi de slenderman echa por un fan que este trailer, solo espero que en la peli aparesca muchisimas veces >:)"
ySy8mcceTno,this is real?
ySy8mcceTno,This isn't what I was thinking. I was expecting Slenderman to be in the background of every shot in the woods. Maybe I just haven't seen him yet.
ySy8mcceTno,"wow finally, that took like... 6 years? idk when that story came, but i know that a lot of people wanted this.... idk if will watch? xD i mean im not into it anymore xD"
ySy8mcceTno,*Sombody touche my spaget*
ySy8mcceTno,What a shitty film this would be.
ySy8mcceTno,yey
ySy8mcceTno,A r e y o u f u c k i n g s e r i o u s
ySy8mcceTno,I think they ruined slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,wtf you dont see him in the trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,He wasn't in the movies because once he sees you he controlls your nightmares idk that's what I think
ySy8mcceTno,"[VOZ LOQUENDO]Hola chavales, soy el LoquenderoMaster8000 y antes que nada les quiero desear un feliz año 2010. Espero que se la pasen genial. Bueno, terminando con esta intro, hoy les quiero compartir una creepypasta muy aterradora que me encontré en la Deep Web llama Slenderman, me llamó mi atención y me la leí completa y ahora quiero compartirla con ustedes, espero la disfruten y tengan dulces sueños 😆:
Todo comenzó una noche..."
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf slender man was relevant in like 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"Friend: hey did you hear they are making a slender man movie 

Me:takes hat off hmm slender man haven’t herd that name in years ..."
ySy8mcceTno,"If this was like actually really good, i would have had to buy a box full of kittens after watching it"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ricegum: ""I R R E L E V A N T !"""
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks OK, Sony usually makes horrible films, but life was a great film so they have proven that they can makegood movies, I think this film deserves a chance, don't hate when you haven't even whatched it yet"
ySy8mcceTno,Like soy mexicano
ySy8mcceTno,Achei esse trailer bem fraquinho .
ySy8mcceTno,*sigh* ...
ySy8mcceTno,like si vienes por kemiwo :v
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna suck.
ySy8mcceTno,porfin
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm Now this should be Interesting 😄👍🏻
ySy8mcceTno,Alguem brasileiro
ySy8mcceTno,"This type of movie would have fitted The Blair Witch Project ""found footage"" style quite well. However I am guessing it is just going to make its own story up and not by anything like the creepypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for this for the past 6 years!
ySy8mcceTno,Omg what is this 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Up next: The Five Nights at Freddy's Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't expect this at all 👀
ySy8mcceTno,nice
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't mind this, I know it is way to late, but it is nostalgic"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man is just Logan Paul looking for dead bodies in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a resident evil 7 live action movie than a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is almost like final destination meets incedious 6/10
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,They got it all wrong
ySy8mcceTno,Ngl you've got some interesting visual style here but come on... this is overdone
ySy8mcceTno,This anything
ySy8mcceTno,wow
ySy8mcceTno,Collect eight pages of script to finish the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why are horror movies getting worse these days?
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm a big fan of horror movies, have been for 40 years. This movie, from what I've seen in this trailer, looks ridiculous. Hopefully  the movie itself doesn't suck as much as this preview.  Making a movie from a creepy pasta that was popular a couple years ago, that had no back story and no purpose or reason for being, seems like a terrible premise for a movie."
ySy8mcceTno,I am so super excited for this movie! ^^
ySy8mcceTno,A too soft trailer
ySy8mcceTno,A real horror movie has no cheap jump scares
ySy8mcceTno,i came here to write my own thoughts about this trailer but it seems I don't have to. It's good to know most of you had the same thoughts about it
ySy8mcceTno,"Would have been so much better if it was based on the two 12 yearolds girls who stabbed their bestfriend for Slenderman. This trailer looks ""meh"" and not that interesting. I literally made a better plot in the matter of 30 seconds..."
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting since 2012 for this
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone think this look like The Rings
ySy8mcceTno,Did you just assume Slenderman's gender?
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of the Ring movie
ySy8mcceTno,ONE SKINNY BOI
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if Marble Hornets will be given proper royalties
ySy8mcceTno,"Just let slender man be, he’s been through too much cancer already as it is"
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe i watch this 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Where is even the Slender Man!?
ySy8mcceTno,All the haters you know you are gonna see this awesome movie so stfu
ySy8mcceTno,:0
ySy8mcceTno,To ne what would be cool is that tgey found her dead and on a tree
ySy8mcceTno,Felt like The Ring
ySy8mcceTno,Yay! More terrible horror movies.
ySy8mcceTno,They should've made this when it was actually trending but that was years ago lol
ySy8mcceTno,Thats tuff
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, a Slender Man origin story, can't wait till he joins the Avengers!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Guess no one gave the person who green lit this a calendar, 'cause he still thinks this is 2012."
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, so this is SLENDER MAN not slenderman so this is fake :D"
ySy8mcceTno,"I can’t believe this. Slender man was the game at 2013 what everyone used to play, and movie released 2018. Well fucking done"
ySy8mcceTno,this looks stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,hi there
ySy8mcceTno,"SWEET 2013 OH DO I MISS SLENDER MAN







not sarcasm"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie looks more inspired on the Creepypasta than the videogame, that's good, let's hope they stick more to that lore and borrow from the game some facts... also... the scene where the girl stabs her forehead... a reference to what happend with those real life girls that wanted to kill her friend to see slenderman?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ya era hora
ySy8mcceTno,Wat huge lit down I’ve watched fan films better then this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a fan made trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Judging from the trailer this might be one of the most predictable horror movies ever.
ySy8mcceTno,Who thought this was a good idea
ySy8mcceTno,Gaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,"I wasted 1 minute and 40 seconds of my life watching a girl on a hospital bed screaming ""NO"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello, today we are gonna play Slenderman 2009. A very popular game being played by people"
ySy8mcceTno,"Pero qué? El trailer es horrible, espero que la película no lo sea porque me gusta mucho slenderman, me emocioné mucho al ver la miniatura del video... Pero el trailer promete lo peor :/"
ySy8mcceTno,Just... why?
ySy8mcceTno,"Can someone explain why she stabbed herself?
It didn't even look like she wanted to do it, like she was being controlled.
Like seriously, if there's just random gore without any actual reason then this will be terrible."
ySy8mcceTno,Sera real
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, listen.... No"
ySy8mcceTno,from the people who brought you the emoji movie...
ySy8mcceTno,OMG YESSS! Im so movie jumping to see this!! Looks so scary!! YEAHSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,"Cara,imagina aparecer o Jeff The Killer nesse filme KKKKKKKKK ia ser legal"
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone care about slender man anymore?
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when Slender was popular and we wanted a movie made out of it? Me neither.
ySy8mcceTno,#SAVEFOGBOI
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like a bunch of pictures off the internet and loud noises and horrible actors no one has heard of to pretend to be scared so will not be seeing this one it’s prob gonna make 5$
ySy8mcceTno,I Aint never been hyped for a scary movie this is the first *sees trailer* oh THATS NOT SCARY AT ALL
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t know if I️ should be afraid for my anxiety or Slenderman’s reputation. Because if there’s one thing I️ know about film that is if they show most of the story in the trailers it’s not going to be good but yet again it doesn’t seem like that, so I️m still open to see it, but there is one thing WHERE MY BOI JEFF! I️ KNOW THERE BOTH DIFFERENT STORYS BUT YET AGAIN IF THEY DO FOG BOI THEY GOT TO DO JEFF COME ON SONY! But yet again Sony might not be a good choice to make a film about him."
ySy8mcceTno,"I wish that could have slenderman's proxies (hoddie,masky, toby etc)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Too cheesy 






It hurts my soul








O wait i dont have a soul"
ySy8mcceTno,"slenderman should be disturbing, not scary. they are gonna ruin it. and if it doesnt have a tuxedo i'm gonna be pissed, but who care anyways..."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally its official
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: oh boy a slenderman movie ! Im glad its finally being....

ySy8mcceTno,Still gonna go see it because edgy 13 year old me who read creepypastas all day would want me too lol
ySy8mcceTno,The Slenderman craze ended years ago....

ySy8mcceTno,TURUBOM?? MEU DEUS EU VOU ASSISTIR ISSO COM CERTEZA!!

ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman vs Mr. Fantastic vs. Plasticman. Go!
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait

ySy8mcceTno,"I don't give a crap what y'all are saying

I'm excited for this"
ySy8mcceTno,this would've been cooler in 2013
ySy8mcceTno,The whole thing looks like an extended intro of bray wyattts entrance lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello. Yeah, this is 2013 speaking, I would like to get back my meme please."
ySy8mcceTno,Good job Sony you were only.... um......... 6 1/2 Years late!

ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is real. I saw him myself and filmed it.  I’m surprised the video hasn’t gone viral considering it’s concrete evidence.  Keep asking questions
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, it's a Sony film."
ySy8mcceTno,Uia uia uiaaa q medo
ySy8mcceTno,Woah I haven’t seen this game in like 2 years and now there making a movie about it?
ySy8mcceTno,But why? I dont think anyone needed this.
ySy8mcceTno,About time slender man has a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Make Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why can't it be Obeseman
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,A lot of 'ring' imagery

ySy8mcceTno,КАКОЙ МИЛЫЙ ФИЛЬМ
ySy8mcceTno,"¿En serio van a sacar una pelicula de Slender Man?
Wow."
ySy8mcceTno,This sucks because they use the stereotypical character gender for horror movies which is a girl. MEN CAN BE SPOOKY TOO
ySy8mcceTno,This meme died in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,My losing streaks in overwatch is scarier that the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait I don’t get it, how is Slenderman scary? I think any semblance of creepiness to him is ruined by the fact that he wears a suit which completely thenopposite of scary...unless you have a daunting fear of job interviews!"
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer isn't even scary
ySy8mcceTno,Forest Shots: The Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like a typical shitty horror movie about something that isn’t relevant anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,People stop complaining I want to watch the movie when it comes out and I can't when people is complaining about it just saying guys and don't even think about insulting me because of this comment
ySy8mcceTno,"I agree this is way too late, this movie should've come out when Slender man was trendy"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys Logan Paul here and we are at a forset and.......OMG COOL LOOK AT THIS DEAD BODY! *slender goes behind him* COOL DUDE LOOK IM BEING KILLED!
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch this when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,"يقول الشاعر :

ySy8mcceTno,Bet half of the movie is gonna be about kids killing themselves and the other half is gonna be about Slender Man but you only see him once in the whole film
ySy8mcceTno,It would have been good if it was about the game. This just seems draggy and tryhard stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Great.
ySy8mcceTno,"Apparently they are not aware that a little girl was almost stabbed to death by two other little girls over their “slenderman” obsession?  Or maybe they are and want to capitalize on the publicity from that?  Pretty sleazy, low down stuff."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks guud
ySy8mcceTno,So.. What's the movie about?
ySy8mcceTno,Not scare for my
ySy8mcceTno,Ive got more horror than you need
ySy8mcceTno,The emoji movies whas scaryer than this
ySy8mcceTno,How is weel felm
ySy8mcceTno,So whats next? Jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,But where are the pages tho????!?!?!?!?!?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,So a movie about slenderman but we see him for 4 seconds of 2 min and 39 seconds? OK SONY
ySy8mcceTno,I wish the movie have firstperson part using camera that bring the memory of the game
ySy8mcceTno,god this reminds me alot about stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this is scarier than the emoji movie 👏
ySy8mcceTno,"Why did it take so long to make the movie. I like slender man, I really do but geez a little too late. And cmon where's Five Nights At Freddys"
ySy8mcceTno,What a disgrace to slender man
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think this movie is really based on the game slender man. More on the real life events in which two girls stabbed another girl
ySy8mcceTno,Bof
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this looks incredibly stupid.

I thought Slenderman abducted children; not caused teenagers to cause self harm."
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or did you hear Allahu Akbar?  1:54
ySy8mcceTno,pqp que bosta de trailer ctz q o filme vai ser pior
ySy8mcceTno,I was looking for him in the woods in the entire trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Let me guess 🤔💭 the Slenderman is the tall lanky evil faceless spirit wears ether a tuxedo 🤵 or a suit and has tentacles 🐙 behind him
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman in 2018?
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't understand what this is... Slenderman is not suppose to be a gore fest with disturbing imagery, it's about pure terror of facing something that you has no idea what it is and even what it will do to you if it catches you. It's about unknown. Literally fear with no face. This trailer made me think that peop,e who are making this movie have no clue what Slenderman actually is. I mean, they couldn't even type his name right... Not excited."
ySy8mcceTno,So hes a girl
ySy8mcceTno,DIDNT SEE THAT COMINGG
ySy8mcceTno,well im just going to waiit for jeff the killer now lol
ySy8mcceTno,It dosent even look like its made in the game all i see is a girl getting lost a girl stabing herself a guy commit suicide a weird girl who spits whatever the f××× is that and Basically Not slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Looks lit yo
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda like it acctually
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting!
ySy8mcceTno,Sinistro
ySy8mcceTno,"Movie run time 2 hours 30 minutes. 
Slendy's time on screen, .00001 seconds."
ySy8mcceTno,"This company brings out so many movies so late.  First Angry Birds, now Slenderman.  

Also, I'm 99% Marble hornets will still be better than this."
ySy8mcceTno,"WOW!! slenderman looks so wimpy, it would be scary if they had him in a black suit with a white face... LAME!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, they’re desperate. I mean this mediocre game cam out half a decade ago."
ySy8mcceTno,What next? Sonic.exe movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Another autistic hollywood adaptation of a 10 year old creepypasta. I predict 0.7/10 on RottenTomatoes.
ySy8mcceTno,If the emoji movie didn't was enough
ySy8mcceTno,С русского по Лукасу
ySy8mcceTno,Its slenderman not slender man blyat!
ySy8mcceTno,another horror film with generic characters and no solid plotline :/ this could actually be a good movie if it didn't go straight to shock value. At least thats what I see in this trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,2019: Jake Paul: The Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Porque rayos no hiciero la Pelicula de God of War

ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman's Timeline

-First, he was a game.
-Then he was a creepypaster.
-Now he is a movie.
-Next he will be a weird music video.
-Finally, all credibility of Slenderman will be lost forever.

And after the movie, no one will care."
ySy8mcceTno,shoulda just gave him the 20 dollars man
ySy8mcceTno,"Already hate this. For One, Slenderman hasn't been relevant since like 2013 or 14. Second, the appeal of Slenderman is that there is no plot, there is no deep story or message about humanity just find pages and hope you can collect all 8 (or was it 7? Like I said, 2013) without dying. It was cool because there was literally nothing to be afraid of if you really dissect it, there wasn't even real jumpscares. If you saw him you would have to do a 180 then move on with your day. It was the atmosphere that made it scary. But now it's all cliche. Teenages killing themselves in inappropriate places like in class, scientist saying it's like a virus, etc."
ySy8mcceTno,2:15 what happened to her. Like I don’t rlly know about Slenderman but what did he do
ySy8mcceTno,"IDK what everyones complaining about. It's not a book adaption or remake. It's not a marvel movie. There's no bad college jokes. There's no mary sues, preachy forceful moralising and whipped soyboy men. I mean it could be terrible, and possibly is, and is certainly cynically using an urban myth/creepypasta, but the grading for movies ATM is down so low, that all you need to make is something that doesn't make you nuke the planet from orbit and you've made a classic."
ySy8mcceTno,What?
ySy8mcceTno,Someone please tell me were masky and hoody are
ySy8mcceTno,"Bad Film based on Video Game Ever.....,"
ySy8mcceTno,Took long enough
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or does this look like a comedy film...
ySy8mcceTno,So late slender ain’t even relevant anymore
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,Is this movie is releasing in Tamil.
ySy8mcceTno,PEWDS MUST SEE THIS!!
ySy8mcceTno,reminds me of stranger things and IT
ySy8mcceTno,"Screw the haters, I've been waiting ages for this guy to get into the big screen AND I'M NOT MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE MOVIE!"
ySy8mcceTno,whack
ySy8mcceTno,How tf did she stab through her skull? it looks like a fuckin butter knife
ySy8mcceTno,creepypasta fans be screaming 👿😍
ySy8mcceTno,"they are doing the job marble hornets did about 8 years ago -.- i really hope they did research into the slenderman mythos and didnt just take a quick glance and go 'Oh, look. theres a scary story thats trending. lets make it into a movie to capitalize on it!'"
ySy8mcceTno,Next up on the list is The Roblox Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Men is an unknown faceless entity and not some kind of bleeding monster. This monster is a bad copy of Blair Witch monster.
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer just seemed to be another run-of-the-mill horror movie that has nothing to do with Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Is it that hard to make a scary movie or do these guys really suck because I'm sure we've all had scarier dreams than these movies coming out
ySy8mcceTno,"2018... Slenderman has been around for 9 years, and now this is happening? Unless you count that Marble Hornets movie then we should have had this a while ago. Tbh I want to see it but the trailer doesn't look too good and not as scary. There should be more effect but I like how they follow the plot of missing people, what about proxies? Those are a huge part of Slenderman so it should involve that"
ySy8mcceTno,Insideous+IT+Evil Dead=a bit late to jump on the band wagon.
ySy8mcceTno,No slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this for real or fan made? 
All tho,i don't see slenderman at all.."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Laughing jack would be a way better movie in all honesty.
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for Amnesia: The Dark Descent The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Hubiera estado ""en mi opinión"" mejor en primera persona, seria como el clásico juego de pc."
ySy8mcceTno,SO NOW WE INVITE CREEPYPASTA INTO THE WORLD (I want Jeff the killer next)
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks more like a movie using imagery from The Ring, an antagonist like the Mind Flayer from ST2, and may kill off people like probably either the Happening or Another"
ySy8mcceTno,"The girls that got stabbed for the ""sacrifice"" for slenderman should watch this"
ySy8mcceTno,This is pretty cruel to make this movie since there have been real suicide victims & their families are still suffering.
ySy8mcceTno,"b...but slenderman had a white ""face"" and a black suit with a red bowtie...... whys he a black creature???????????????///"
ySy8mcceTno,they barely even show him
ySy8mcceTno,is this really happening
ySy8mcceTno,น่าดู
ySy8mcceTno,Why are you doing this to me
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh god here we go, 50/50 comments and ratings on this movie varying from this movie is too late, this movies details aren't exact, this movie is money whoring, this movie is a good horror movie to not take serious, this movie trailers first and second suggested videos are about the girl who got stabbed(slender man stabbing) and survived."
ySy8mcceTno,The only scary part was when she shoved that knife in her eye
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus😳
And this is coming from a creepypasta fan"
ySy8mcceTno,This could make a great horror game
ySy8mcceTno,Hate me if you want but...I feel like CreepyPasta movies are like anime movies...Best left alone. Because from this trailer I already see that It's going to piss a lot of Slenderman fans off. It's best if they leave this alone...
ySy8mcceTno,Eh
ySy8mcceTno,After so many years  finally
ySy8mcceTno,Way too late there buds
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for them to make a fidget spinner movie in 5 years!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"bringin back dead memes


But seriously this seems and looks amazing hopefully they take elements from marble hornets series
Very very hyped for this"
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Lowkey waiting for the halloween
ySy8mcceTno,"Why can't Hollywood continue good movies like, Harry Potter, The Hobbit, FFS DO ANOTHER JASON MOVIE!!!!!!!!"

Which movies are y'all watchin'?"
ySy8mcceTno,"It's been 7 years, and it doesn't look scary like the games."
ySy8mcceTno,"good creepypasta but the movie looks kind of disappointing (less slenderman, lots of Hollywood fast scenes, sony)."
ySy8mcceTno,Way to strike when the iron is ice cold
ySy8mcceTno,Insert creepy images for 2 hours.
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't think it's a good idea but it could work. it looks suspenseful but it's no dialogue , I don't know what's the point smh but I'ma give it a try."
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems psychological than what people are saying. Personally I don't think it'll be like monsters and jump scares but more of a fucked up look on the psyche when exposed to him. The flashes to those short videos is good, I think I'll have a look"
ySy8mcceTno,i saw this. i started laughing
ySy8mcceTno,#
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is Kevin Durant
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, just, what's an easy way of putting this?  Slenderman hasn't been relevant for several years now and it seems to me like you're trying too hard to figure out what the kids like.  First, slenderman is depicted as silent, he mysteriously causes children to disappear, not kill themselves.   I can't believe I'm saying this considering how much I hate this format, but the film would work better as a found footage type of affair, where the monster isn't shown off until a decent point in the story.  The point that made slender seem scary was that it was hard to know if it could be real or not, this misses the mark by making him almost like any other horror character.  The character didn't seem well designed either, I know CGI could do wonders with characters but Slender, to my knowledge, hasn't been depicted as using his hands to grab victims, he uses tentacles that come from his back.  Just...first we get the smurfs, then pixels, then the emoji movie, now this.  Is this supposed to be an edgy phase?"
ySy8mcceTno,Finaly....
ySy8mcceTno,Shoulda done the original jump scare with the static somewhere
ySy8mcceTno,АХУЕТЬ НЕ ВСТАТЬ!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I hope its going to be better than the other one.
ySy8mcceTno,Don't hug me i'm fake :(
ySy8mcceTno,Let slenderman die
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow

Just 

Wow 




What's next : GRAND THEFT AUTO MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm looking forward to this movie... Which is probably a bad idea.
ySy8mcceTno,"2017:emoji movie 
Me:get this trash out of here

2018:slender man movie
Me:WHAT THE FUUUUU

2019:DO YOU KNOW DE WAY

ySy8mcceTno,"I have one word, only one word for this trailer





Why?"
ySy8mcceTno,"0:43 they spoiled the whole entire ending to the movie, as you can see the main protagonist has just found all the pages in one room. EASY 0 DEATHS GUYS"
ySy8mcceTno,wow good job :)
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I skipped the Emoji Movie so Sony gets this chance with me. I have about as much confidence in Creepy Pasta movies as I do with video game movies but this is my favorite creepy pasta.
ySy8mcceTno,THE CREEPYPASTA MAKES A RETURN
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope either the original writers, or the girl who almost got killed over this Slenderman BS, are getting money from this movie."

ySy8mcceTno,Another video game movie? Boooo! pick a plot line!
ySy8mcceTno,*turns to the Creepypasta fandom* It's starting. Our hopes and dreams
ySy8mcceTno,"It just proves that making stuff about people habging in woods gets you on trending 




Get it"
ySy8mcceTno,"So, I'm the only person here knowing both the game and the myth and still like this trailer?"
ySy8mcceTno,Seriously? another slenderman movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Well it’s 2018 and I’m pretty sure we left slender man back in 2015. Also this just looks like a trash “the happening” rip off. Mixed with a little bit of any paranormal horror movie you’ve seen before 20 times
ySy8mcceTno,All I can think of is Conan O’Brien’s review of the game lol
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they make a movie!
ySy8mcceTno,It's gonna be bad not much story to go off of except the creepy pasta and small game details but that's about it
ySy8mcceTno,They didn't use his iconic eerie track when he emerges. I'm fucking disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things season 3 coming soon
ySy8mcceTno,When you get your memes from internet explorer.
ySy8mcceTno,"Great 
An overrated creepypasta character gets a movie 

They should of at least made the movie when the character was popular and not that overrated yet -_-"
ySy8mcceTno,low key i  think this gave me cancer...
ySy8mcceTno,You are 6 years late.... 6 years
ySy8mcceTno,"Lets face the facts.
This movie has nothing riding on it but name recognition."
ySy8mcceTno,n o
ySy8mcceTno,"A little late for the party, don't you think?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, this is going to blow."
ySy8mcceTno,i wouldn't be surprised if pewdiepie made an appearance. you know he'd probably be the slenderman himself.
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 I hear the gay elephant noise littlekuriboh was right 😱
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if it's going to be good or not
ySy8mcceTno,"So slender posses people now?!



What a great idea -.- *rolls eyes*"
ySy8mcceTno,looks lame
ySy8mcceTno,Is this rlly gonna be an actual movie
ySy8mcceTno,It's a little late for this don't you think?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok... a movie about a game, FROM 8 YEARS AGO 
Lemme be honest, it’s become kind of cliche but ok"
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for the Candy crush movie!
ySy8mcceTno,philips pictures is better

Buuut, i mean..i'm...kinda interested in seeing how this will turn out when it's in theaters.
i mean, of course this is the company who made that ""Emoji Movie"" which was totally a failure.  
but seriously though, i kinda think this movie's gonna be..kinda okay, even if it's not really a good idea to begin with."

But well ..im going to watch it.!!"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks pretty amazing
ySy8mcceTno,"Lyrics:

Your time is up, my time is now,
You can’t see me, my time is now

Oops, wrong video"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, even the fucking trailer had jump scares. This will flop, hard."
ySy8mcceTno,A little late there.....
ySy8mcceTno,creepy! cant wait to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,You're 3 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,sony gonna make another shitty movie
ySy8mcceTno,isn’t this a little to late lmao
ySy8mcceTno,I see Sony is striking while the iron is ice cold
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like all the horror movie cliches packed into one movie-----and slenderman happens to be there
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,A couple years too late Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,"Let's see, how many times have movies derived from video games actually been a success? ( only one I can think of was Assassins Creed and there was still a lot of incorrect information)"
ySy8mcceTno,Fucking horseshit
ySy8mcceTno,Penis
ySy8mcceTno,NANI?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of stranger things any one else ... ohh wait my sister is watching stranger things nvm
ySy8mcceTno,This is such a joke
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is bad do you guys agree or nah
ySy8mcceTno,And I thought Slenderman was a man.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,Couple years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Great now the people that believe that Slenderman is actually real and they see this movie they'll really do anything to make sure he doesn't come after them way to make more people terrified about a fake horror creature
ySy8mcceTno,I'm expect nothing good from this.
ySy8mcceTno,Algun comentario en español?😕
ySy8mcceTno,"Some girls murdered someone for real cause of this franchise, made a lot of headlines in the US, now they made it a movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope they know what slender man is and what he does, I’m hoping they don’t ruin the movie and also keep with his no face and tuxedo"
ySy8mcceTno,HELL YEAH I AM GOING TO THIS MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Y la voz de Loquendo? :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, a movie about slenderman where it focuses heavily more on the victom rather then a good balance between just 1 victom and slenderman himself. ;-; greeeaaaaaatttt isnt the job of major movie companies to be looked up to, not looked down on? Sooo confusing"
ySy8mcceTno,They just need to come out with a Jeff the Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"TO THOSE OF YOU WHO WENT FULL SCREEN








BLESS YOUR BRAVE SOULS!😇"
ySy8mcceTno,This is why Spider-Man needed to go back to Marvel.
ySy8mcceTno,You're 6 years late sony
ySy8mcceTno,"this is so cool
imma watch it!"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man is Nyralethotep
ySy8mcceTno,looks like trash MH was better
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah I didn’t need sleep anyway
ySy8mcceTno,Dice el 2009 que le regresen sus creepypastas :v
ySy8mcceTno,they should have made this when Slenderman was hyped. they're a little late with this movie
ySy8mcceTno,It's still a better love story than twilight...
ySy8mcceTno,"Sweet, a c fictional creepy pasta is now a movie, not fan made, I love it XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Whos around the corner? Wearing stretchy close? The slenderman the slenderman can
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years too late, but if this movie is a little good
I at least hope they get the proxies from slender: the arrival"
ySy8mcceTno,Yes yes yes yes yes!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone stop complaining about the new Slenderman movie coming out. It's going to hit theaters no matter what so get over it. And to be honest I can't wait for it to come out.
ySy8mcceTno,I REALLY hope the original author of the creepypasta gets some sort of royalties. Or at least credited.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG IT IS COMING OUT
ySy8mcceTno,La quiero ver
ySy8mcceTno,Slendeman creeps me out for some reason
ySy8mcceTno,I would love to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is that all you got ? Not impressed what is this some cliche horror movie? Yea sorry but great Video though
ySy8mcceTno,*no*...
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boi
ySy8mcceTno,Movimiento naranja el futuro está en tus manos na na na na na na :v
ySy8mcceTno,Los pergaminos dijeron la verdad...zobre ezte niu peliculon krnal :v
ySy8mcceTno,"This is going to be an interesting movie. Just wandering how much of slenderman are we going to see? From the trailer, the last part, that's when we see a little bit of slenderman. Can't wait to see it though."
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm crying tears of joy. It's happening, it's finally happening."
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is cinda late for a 2018 movie
ySy8mcceTno,Zoinks
ySy8mcceTno,I wish it was 2012 again....
ySy8mcceTno,"OMFG
OMFG
OMFG
OMFG
OMFG"
ySy8mcceTno,Please be better than the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Watch it be the best movie ever.





It’s probably not gonna be, but I have my hopes...THANKS HOLLYWOOD FOR THIS GEM OF A MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,If you look at him he takes you
ySy8mcceTno,Do you no de wey?
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is a mistake
ySy8mcceTno,Did you know that they are going to make the long dark movie too? Can't wait to see this one too!
ySy8mcceTno,"he`s john cena, you cant see him"
ySy8mcceTno,Can y'all make a Ticci Toby movie
ySy8mcceTno,I like when creepypasta turn into a movie just like channel zero
ySy8mcceTno,we play stop it slender in roblox like if u
ySy8mcceTno,One word. Why?
ySy8mcceTno,"there should make the movie based on lore behind him , like where all the notes come from and stuff"
ySy8mcceTno,damn....i've waited since 2012 for them to make a movie about this and now I actually don't wanna see it :/
ySy8mcceTno,Dang
ySy8mcceTno,This really doesn't need to be a thing at all.
ySy8mcceTno,"You're about five years too late, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Made this movie a little too late the slender man craze died already
ySy8mcceTno,Think they’re a little late
ySy8mcceTno,well jeffrhe killer is next
ySy8mcceTno,All these cameras should be turning static
ySy8mcceTno,"I was wondering when a movie about Slender Man would come along. Maybe we'll some some movies about the cursed Zelda cartridge or the Jeff the Killer. Then after awhile, a big fat Creepypasta mash up! :D"
ySy8mcceTno,:o
ySy8mcceTno,Noice
ySy8mcceTno,I BEEN WAITING! YES!
ySy8mcceTno,"Can they finally make a decent movie about a video game??? IDK but we will see. (Note: probably not cuz it’s made by Sony.)

Edit: what about the 8 pages??"
ySy8mcceTno,"A message to Sony:
This is a hugely famous internet story. Millions of fans. I mean MILLIONS. If you screw this up for them, there will be major consequences to your company. You have chosen a tough story to live up to."
ySy8mcceTno,"First emojis
Then slender
Movies stop ruining things

Better have kate."
ySy8mcceTno,"First Slender : The Eight Pages, then other ones, THEN THIS."
ySy8mcceTno,"I prefer the original, names ""Slenderman Gangdam style"""
ySy8mcceTno,"I didn't expect anything good, but still had hope, but WOW!! this looks like absolute GARBAGE."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie going to suck that's not even how it looks or what he do.....just okay wow
ySy8mcceTno,I think it's a wee bit too late to make a movie about Slender Man. Maybe you guys should've tried 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,No just no
ySy8mcceTno,Who Else Didn't Watch The Video In Full Screen.😲
ySy8mcceTno,"Coming from somebody who understands Leafy has ruined this word...






Oh the cringe"
ySy8mcceTno,"To people saying they hate when ""shitty stories"" are made into movies... I understand that Jeff The Killer story was kind of a mess, the whole ""fighting scene"" with the bullies that is... But what is wrong with the story of Slenderman? It is quite good and I can't see a problem with it."
ySy8mcceTno,If the trailer is anything to go on it's going to be terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,Haven't heard about this legend in years... he's finally back
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a poorly made fan trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it said spiderman.. :(
ySy8mcceTno,I want to know when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,It already gets so much hate and so will I if I say that I'm actually curious of how they will make it and so far it seems kinda creepy... Like I never found Slenderman to be scary or something
ySy8mcceTno,How about slindrina??
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted this movie to be announced so bad but now I just want these film makers to cease their existence.
ySy8mcceTno,Is that movie release in india??
ySy8mcceTno,if finally after so much waiting time :)
ySy8mcceTno,don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it don't say it don't think it
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay sony, I get why you'd target emoji's, they're still sadly relevant. But slenderman? Thing hasn't been popular since what like  2011, 2012? Kinda late to the party dont'cha think?"
ySy8mcceTno,If the creators of marble hornets isn't credited for this I swear to god
ySy8mcceTno,H. E. N. T. A. I.
ySy8mcceTno,Santiago
ySy8mcceTno,TOP 5 SLENDERMAN SIGHTINGS CAUGHT ON CAMERA IN REAL LIFE!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This is the reason why people kill them selves..
ySy8mcceTno,"The ring? The exorcist? Why all the ""horror"" movies look like the same boring thing ...  :/"
ySy8mcceTno,"Batman: tell me do you bleed 
Slender men: ........ 
Batman : you well"
ySy8mcceTno,"Why does Sony try to make movies?

Edit: Try being the operative word."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty gay
ySy8mcceTno,"After 7 years of being an internet phenomena, someone finally decided to make a proper movie about it"
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t let it suck
ySy8mcceTno,Yas Queen
ySy8mcceTno,Yall better give him his $20
ySy8mcceTno,Call me the odd one out here but this could be cool.
ySy8mcceTno,All i just want is that they wont make it as Leprechaun remake (Only seeing the Monster 2 seconds or Only his hand)
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man was first created in 2009 uh Sony you may be tad late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,So I'm guessing this also has some connection with the real life case.
ySy8mcceTno,This should have been made years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Is this serious?
ySy8mcceTno,"Think the movie would be good if it was lost footage style, like the Bliar Witch Project"
ySy8mcceTno,"2018 is gonna be a good year *drops trailer for a creepypasta character that went out of style in 2013*

2018 already ruined"
ySy8mcceTno,do yu no da wey
ySy8mcceTno,Sony... Honey... This is about six years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,"I just realized Sony made this. 






*So I’m assuming that this is going to involve feminazis and playing the “guys are assholes” trope?*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Not gonna lie, *I’m fucking hyped*"
ySy8mcceTno,I CALLED IT. I CALLED 2018. I CALLED IT.
ySy8mcceTno,The Creepypasta fandom is S H O O K.
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf 😃
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t even seem scary
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve waited so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,#1 must see movie
ySy8mcceTno,Too bad they’re 6 years late for the hype train
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this movie for so long
ySy8mcceTno,Finaly is have come to real movie noice too long! Too! Long!
ySy8mcceTno,"I want this movie to be good, I really do."
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony
what did you just done"
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's good
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks so lame I mean don't get me wrong good cenamatics and recording but other than that, it looks nothing like what the legends tell and such"
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the 8 pages tho???
ySy8mcceTno,IM SO FUCKING HIPED
ySy8mcceTno,starring KEVIN Durant
ySy8mcceTno,What a terrible trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,I knew it in 2012 I old myself I wish there was a slender man movie and now my wish is complete
ySy8mcceTno,1:20 Gay elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,I dont think its as scary and intense as the game
ySy8mcceTno,"It's just a prank, bro. It's just a prank."
ySy8mcceTno,This was spooke
ySy8mcceTno,wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,Sony should be ashamed of themselves after what actually happened. This is profiting off of a tragedy and I will have no part of it.
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when this was a video game?
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho?
ySy8mcceTno,2017 spinners and clowns 2018 slenderman movie...
ySy8mcceTno,So...where is he?
ySy8mcceTno,"Alright I don't wanna hear it but as long as it's a good movie whilst they did their research and stick to the original source material to what made it creepy in the first place i'll be fine with it, if it happens to be a good horror movie and serve its purpose"
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer look like a fanmade
ySy8mcceTno,"Un poco tarde, pero mejor tarde que nunca."
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, this feels like total bullshit. We hardly see the title character."
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope Eric Knudsen (the creator of slender man) as well as Marble Hornets (the youtube team who popularized and possibly created the ""slender man sickness"") will be properly credited."
ySy8mcceTno,They should do a creppypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,I have no words
ySy8mcceTno,final-fucking-lly
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell naw
ySy8mcceTno,"Dayyyyyummm, this better live up to the games"
ySy8mcceTno,this whole movie looks like a L
ySy8mcceTno,Finally slender man I'll see you soon😘😘😎😎😎
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but you're 9 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,This is technically the bye bye man #2
ySy8mcceTno,"I always wanted a Slender Man movie, but this isn't exactly what i hoped for."
ySy8mcceTno,"7 years too late, buckko"
ySy8mcceTno,Horror movies are the best
ySy8mcceTno,Is Jeff the killer next to get a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I'm 13 and doesn't
ySy8mcceTno,Looks cool
ySy8mcceTno,is this a reboot one the first slender? I hear that one was terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,This is a joke right?
ySy8mcceTno,"There's a lot of potential in Slender Man to be a genuinely creepy movie monster. Sadly, I fully expect this to be another mediocre horror film full of nothing but jump scares and gross-out imagery with only a half-assed plot to tie it all tenuously together."
ySy8mcceTno,This can't be real. Y'all are like 6 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this the most boring trailer ive ever seen?
ySy8mcceTno,"I like Slenderman Cause he is creppy Pasta 
Like if you are A Creppy Pasta Fan"
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is the worst trailer I have ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,Stupid trailer
ySy8mcceTno,What is this.....2012?
ySy8mcceTno,اللي من طرف ابو عطوان يحط لايك
ySy8mcceTno,Way to go and ruin my favourite horror game... thanks hollywood.
ySy8mcceTno,is this legit
ySy8mcceTno,"What...Wait...no no no...no...Slenderman has TENTACLES!
Almost every iteration he has TENTACLES!
Not long, spindly fingers...I mean he has them but not like SUPER LONG
And why isn’t he distorting reality or have any of his proxies?!
If you’re gonna make a film adaption stick to the lore!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Eeeh, I think I'll just watch Marble Hornets again. :/"
ySy8mcceTno,please don't be trash please don't be trash please don't be trash
ySy8mcceTno,"What is this, now, the 4th attempt to make a Slender Man movie? Marble Hornets, pretty much the most popular arg related to SM, ended *4 years ago* . Hollywood execs, stop trying to be relateable and *give the people what they ask for* , not what you think we want. (And if you want to make a movie that's ""hip and cool"", at least try to follow trends that are less than a year old, and isn't based off a dead internet meme)."
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean, having a neutral perpective, it doesn't look like a HORRIBLE horror movie concept. I think it's just the fact that it's Slenderman that kills it for people."
ySy8mcceTno,"Can't get any worst than the first slenderman movie, amirite?







Yes, there is a *FIRST* Slenderman movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when slender man is still a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I'M TOTALLY GONNA WATCH THAT MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,I passed out when I saw this !
ySy8mcceTno,You've gotta be shitting my nuts.
ySy8mcceTno,Boooo! That looked so lame and stupid. My farts are more scary then this trailer!
ySy8mcceTno,"no lo se rik patece falzo ',:^"
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the sound affect that usually accompanied Slender Man in most forms of media he's in?
ySy8mcceTno,:v
ySy8mcceTno,When you release a trailer 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Don't ruin it. Y'all better do it right that kind of looks disappointing
ySy8mcceTno,Well it's a Sony movie so at this point it would surprise me if it didn't suck.
ySy8mcceTno,"*His name is Slenderman*
*No Slender Man*

*But whatever*"
ySy8mcceTno,"wtf, it didnt even show slender man, it just showed a whole lot of disgustin stuff like worms and other stuff + some scary af girl, all we saw was slenders tall body in"
ySy8mcceTno,pi pi piter la angulia
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"this is a joke right, like those fanmade trailers....right"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is overused
ySy8mcceTno,0:
ySy8mcceTno,I think slender man just wanted a hug
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, Marik and Bakura lied to me, There's no elephant noise at 1:23"
ySy8mcceTno,oh for fuck's sake
ySy8mcceTno,Making a scrappy movie about Slender man to milk the hell out of internet lore. At the very least try to make the trailer appealing.
ySy8mcceTno,It's pretty incredible to have seen this blossom from meme to movie!
ySy8mcceTno,This is like. 3 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh no, the fanboys are taking OVER!!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Seems a little late
ySy8mcceTno,A creepy photoshop that turned into a creepy pasta doesn't need more than a small indie game. This is not something that needs a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like the scary movie that Gabe brought to the Halloween party so Robert California would be impressed.
ySy8mcceTno,We need one about Ticci Toby! If there is one already please tell me.
ySy8mcceTno,"They could have made the ""jump scare"" a lot better. Also this whole trailer is just garbage."
ySy8mcceTno,From the people that brought you the hamburger helper commercials.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man, or white killer"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony movies are really bad... I'll still see it but im setting my expectations way low. Hope to be able to eat my words lol
ySy8mcceTno,"ITS DEAD JIM, LET IT GO."
ySy8mcceTno,This so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone who thinks this is good is either 10 or lower.
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see this move now
ySy8mcceTno,"looks like  pg-13, jump scare nonsense well at least I know what to watch if I have insomnia and want to get some sleep"
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, it's time to called the pastor and exorcism my house from demons."
ySy8mcceTno,OMG CAN'T WAIT IM SO EXCITED 😆
ySy8mcceTno,"You're kidding me. The game got enough hype, and now we're turning Creepypasta's into movies? This trailer made absolutely no sense and saved me a $5 for a ticket to the movies. I honestly think they should spend more time on worthwhile stories to make into movies rather than some urban myth. I understand that this is a 'thriller' movie but still think that there are many other stories that are worthwhile to make into movies. This is just my personal opinion, so please don't insult me."
ySy8mcceTno,Esta madre hubiese gustado en 2010 no en 2018 no mamen 7-7
ySy8mcceTno,It’s not like Marble Hornets exists or anything.
ySy8mcceTno,I really want to see this... 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Only about 10 years late....Also what are the chances this is more based on the two girls who killed that other girl in the woods and blamed it on Slenderman IRL?
ySy8mcceTno,I’m trying to understand wtf is going on
ySy8mcceTno,Fak... they vill butcher this
ySy8mcceTno,"HMM, Sony is making it................ghostbusters(2016) smurfs:the lost village and then  THE EMOJI MOVIE! YEP I AM HIPPED FOR THIS MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,this is insulting to the creator of slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer is really good and dark. But still great. I hope their be a laughing jack movie directed by Tim Burton and Guillermo del toro with half of dark and romantic. Really, both directors should work together. Their the best at dark fantasy movies."
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s not the marvel horned story so it’s gonna Suck, Least in my opinion."
ySy8mcceTno,The sad thing is that someone died because of this. It's like finding out Batman & Robin made cancer.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman trailer with 2 seconds of slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,I'm looking forward to see this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Could've made the movie back when it was really popular
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya es tarde...
15 años tarde png.org >:v"
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t understand what’s going on ?.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony..... stop please just make more games
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, this looks like a genuine bad movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Ok but why though and why now
ySy8mcceTno,oooooooooooook.
ySy8mcceTno,good movie
ySy8mcceTno,What year is it!?
ySy8mcceTno,couldn't they adapt a *good* game? please?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, What's next? Movie about SCPs?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy does not even appear in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,No way!!! I bet my cousin $100 over the summer that slender man would eventually turn into a movie!!! 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,this is the best movie trailer i've seen in my life!
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t they make a documentary
ySy8mcceTno,"* at Sony headquarters* 
Employee: SIR! SIR!
Boss: what?
Employee: we are out of ideas!
Boss:what!
Boss: did we try a bad movie about emojis 
Employee:YES!
Boss:did we try a movie about Jesus Christ that nobody asked for.
Employee:yes
Boss:did we try a movie about a video game that doesn’t really need a movie and is pointless.
Employee: yes
Boss: hmm what’s a trend that doesn’t need a movie and will surprise everyone but at the end will disappoint everyone because we’ll ruin it 
Random guy: hmm I got it!
Boss&employee: what!?
Random guy: slender man!
Boss&employee: yeah!"
ySy8mcceTno,it would've been so much better if they kept the actual details about the original creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,AGORA VAI
ySy8mcceTno,This movie has nothing to do with the woods or paper drawing
ySy8mcceTno,Tendi foi porra nenhuma
ySy8mcceTno,I would say this is awesome! But you guys are way to late for the trend... But I can't say that should make the movie any worse...
ySy8mcceTno,Think Sony will make a creepypasta movie universe Kinda like the mcu? (If they do lets hope they turn out good)
ySy8mcceTno,What is it rated?
ySy8mcceTno,Exijo la película de Jeff The Killer!
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow Sony, you missed the time when this meme was popular. You were 9 years late to the hype train."
ySy8mcceTno,Basically a horrible version of Stranger Things
ySy8mcceTno,Fodaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,"HOLY FREAKING JINGLE BELLS.😱😱 THAT IS SCARY!!!


 Imma watch it though."
ySy8mcceTno,"A faceless guy with a suit chasing some people around a forest at night.was it a concept too hard to grasp?
Looks like sony's gonna turn it into another cliche horror movie with around 15 minutes in wich the actual monster appears and the rest is just build up and cheap scares"
ySy8mcceTno,stop
ySy8mcceTno,It better be facking good
ySy8mcceTno,The Meme Movie (2020)
ySy8mcceTno,What we’re all really waiting for is “Roblox” the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks really good
ySy8mcceTno,So he will be a slasher now or he will still be a creepypasta???
ySy8mcceTno,"For some weird reason I opened another internet tab, muted this trailer. On the other internet tab I played Stairway To Heaven. Surprisingly enough the music actually fits in (at least for me)."
ySy8mcceTno,I think they should make a movie about slender man's underrated brother MEGA MAN
ySy8mcceTno,Ayeeeeee
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, you are better than this. In Ratchet and Clank, Sony was the super beings of the universe. Now you just make crap like this. You changed man. You changed."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm already scared
ySy8mcceTno,"por fiiiiiiiiiiiiin slender man, pero, muy tarde pendejo"
ySy8mcceTno,ITS NOT 2012 ITS 2018 GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this will contribute something new and interesting to this monster’s lore rather than leeching of its popularity like “Always Watching: a Marble Hornets story”. That film was so disappointing smh
ySy8mcceTno,"There's no sense, I dislike this trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t care if it’s crap, it certainly looks creepy"
ySy8mcceTno,Watching this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Now watching this again I don't think Slender Man would do these things. He might drive you crazy buy he'll kill you himself
ySy8mcceTno,"What is the plot about? This trailer literally says nothing about what the movie is about, i mean yeah it’s about slender man but, who are the protagonists? What are they gonna do? What did they do to encounter him?"
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"I literally don't know if this movie looks good or absolutely terrible, this movie can go both ways."
ySy8mcceTno,So.. slenderman is a virus.. why not just make him a MONSTER. Follow his mythos Sony
ySy8mcceTno,To all slender man fans including me
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que no sea como la pelicula de DEATH NOTE una mierda
ySy8mcceTno,I love you Man it's cool ♥ you sony
ySy8mcceTno,All the hard slender man gamers (my self included) are all going to see this and go out telling about how they made slender man into something retarded😢😡😠
ySy8mcceTno,"AÍ MEU DEUS, ,,,ASDOREI"
ySy8mcceTno,how many came here thanks to little kuriboh? For those that did not can you spot the gay elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,YES my dream has come true
ySy8mcceTno,A follow up to Slender Man Gangnam Style?
ySy8mcceTno,that's nice
ySy8mcceTno,tbh this looks cool but not the best.
ySy8mcceTno,I have a feeling this is just gunna be another shitty-mediocre horror movie. Not even excited because I know it will probably be a disappointment.
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is gonna end up being a giant flop.
ySy8mcceTno,There are way to many slender man B movies and an old one that actually had a budget. Oh and let's not forget the a documentaries. Oh and the YouTube short films.....please stop milking this dead mascot.
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda hope this begins a Creepypasta Cinematic Universe at least until we get to Jeff The Killer V Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Legends say that slender still wants his 20$ dollars
ySy8mcceTno,what???
ySy8mcceTno,"That internet series about Slenderman is so much better. What is it called again? 

MarbleHornets. That's it"
ySy8mcceTno,›knows about marble hornets movie and slender vlogs›watches people comment about this being the first slender movie anyway
ySy8mcceTno,Oh
ySy8mcceTno,#cantseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"Yea this is gunna be a bad movie, this looks like a Logan Paul vlog with bad special effects"
ySy8mcceTno,Same monster from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
ySy8mcceTno,It seems they could have called this eny thing because this dose not  look like slender men to me
ySy8mcceTno,I thought I saw one already?
ySy8mcceTno,Of course its Sony who makes this
ySy8mcceTno,SpiderMan SpiderMan....No Wait Is It SlenderMan?...Nah SpiderMan It Is
ySy8mcceTno,"OH DIOS, ESPERE POR ESTO DESDE HACE AÑOS!"
ySy8mcceTno,Man this looks bad. Not even that hype for this.
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie based on a spooky meme back in 2011 or whatever, Wow, this looks so stupid honestly"
ySy8mcceTno,Is This Real ?
ySy8mcceTno,I was waiting for scarce to come from behind a tree
ySy8mcceTno,"Shoulda just hired the dudes who made marble hornets to make this, it’d probably be a good movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"S L E N D Y

B O I"
ySy8mcceTno,This anime looks nice
ySy8mcceTno,I think I'll just rewatch marble hornets instead
ySy8mcceTno,This looks as bad as I would have expected.
ySy8mcceTno,Movies about creepypastas sounds like a great idea but creepypastas aren't really relevant anymore. They came a little late with this one
ySy8mcceTno,Looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,la negra c mató :v
ySy8mcceTno,Hillary as president still scarier...
ySy8mcceTno,Who came here cause of Jesse Barron
ySy8mcceTno,WHY
ySy8mcceTno,SCP Containment Breach movie needs to come
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,At least its based off the creepypasta and not the game.
ySy8mcceTno,one thing i got to say is that this is going to be better than the other slender man movies
ySy8mcceTno,This is nothing like the game
ySy8mcceTno,"Was this supposed to be horror? Because I haven't laughed this hard since Deadpool's teaser ""Wet on Wet""."
ySy8mcceTno,What a stupid movie... Hollywood please come out with some original sh*t...
ySy8mcceTno,This will not bring back 2012 or slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,"mano, ta cheio de coisas sem sentido nesse trailer snabsmsnsmsbsj"
ySy8mcceTno,"They should at least bade it more off the game, tbh I think was kind of a disappointment to the fans of the game"
ySy8mcceTno,So I’m assuming it’s a PG-13 movie thats just a bunch of stock scary images and loud noises.
ySy8mcceTno,I want my SCP Foundation movie.
ySy8mcceTno,OH MEH GOD I CANT WAIT
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!Finally an official trailer of finally SLENDER MAN. About time rumors are put to rest.
ySy8mcceTno,Were tf is slenderman it appears one time
ySy8mcceTno,oh yeah is miancra
ySy8mcceTno,I saw the title and wanted to jump out the window
ySy8mcceTno,Verga wey :v
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought it was only a rumor that a movie was being made.
Clearly, I was wrong."
ySy8mcceTno,**ORGASM**
ySy8mcceTno,gay
ySy8mcceTno,I was supposed to be in this movie .-.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!!! OMG!!! Im fanboy mode
ySy8mcceTno,"This isn't hollywood running out of ideas, this is sony running out of ideas"
ySy8mcceTno,I really don't have hope that it'll be good...to be honest.😑 The other movie ( so bad it was only on TV and it had very low ratings) barely had any scenes of slender man himself. Maybe the people who will work with this movie can prove me wrong. But I don't think so.... also this trailer sucks!!!
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,Looks wack
ySy8mcceTno,So they made a movie about a meme
ySy8mcceTno,I know this is super late and stuff but you have to admit this looks creepy af
ySy8mcceTno,Lets hope nobody gets nightmares
ySy8mcceTno,"....Wtf is this? Seriously, is the actual creator of slenderman ok with this? This is just another horror movie based on a popular fictional character born from the internet. This is like the emoji movie, but worse..."
ySy8mcceTno,"WAIT THERES GOING TO BE A MOVIE ABOUT SLENDY?!, Dang"
ySy8mcceTno,My reaction to seeing this GOOD GOD THIS LOOKS TERRIFYING I LOVE IT
ySy8mcceTno,bet this wont be good
ySy8mcceTno,1:50 Jesuis
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this scense 2016
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouFindHim?
ySy8mcceTno,...
ySy8mcceTno,No tiene nada puto que ver con la historia
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman: stranger things ripoff,    coming soon to theatres"
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, we have a Slenderman movie (which should’ve been made around the time when the creepypasta was popular, but they are so fucking late), but the future is just not looking so bright already. I’ll give this one a shot, but I’ll have you know that Marble Hornets did a better job at the whole Slenderman thing (just a note that they did a great job with the suspense unlike those high-budget horror films.)"
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman now, tomorrow, the grinch stole Christmas 2"
ySy8mcceTno,the new emoji movie looks great!
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, I guess my anticipation for a movie about this arrived 6 years late...um...Yay..."
ySy8mcceTno,:V
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,What would nake this movie tralier better? If kids fought the beast.
ySy8mcceTno,He esperado mucho mucho tiempo para esto...
ySy8mcceTno,"*Ummm, why is this real*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ohhh no, dis too much! It’s all over the place and kinda sloppy how they presented it. Already don’t want to watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,Are they using pages
ySy8mcceTno,No se mira tan buena
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yea
ySy8mcceTno,ward.
ySy8mcceTno,Seems dope
ySy8mcceTno,The ring influence is MASSIVE here. And that's OK to an extent. If treated correctly this could give birth to the next horror movie icon.....IF Treated correctly.
ySy8mcceTno,Would rather watch how Ronald McDonald grew up
ySy8mcceTno,Welp. I wasn't expecting this to happen but oh well. Waiting for the Fnaf tho.
ySy8mcceTno,"0:20 That reminded me of Stranger Things when Joyce was going crazy when her son Will was missing and than in season 2 when he got sick she was like, ""What is wrong with my boy!?"""
ySy8mcceTno,Y tambien va a ser narrrado con loquendo?
ySy8mcceTno,"Страшна! 
Вырубай! ("
ySy8mcceTno,Uhhh 6 years to late guys...
ySy8mcceTno,Noice
ySy8mcceTno,"this should be a POV movie, Who was the guy that made Hardcore Henry movie? Yeah he should be on this project."
ySy8mcceTno,YES!YES!YES!
ySy8mcceTno,weak
ySy8mcceTno,Where were you when i needed you five years ago
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,How many real life kids had to die for them to finally make a movie about this long age meme? 3.  The answer is 3.
ySy8mcceTno,Uhhh Im out bye felica nobody needs you right now
ySy8mcceTno,omg
ySy8mcceTno,"And that's it, that is the WHOLE MOVIE. Scary little girl meets slender man, something happens and then she suffers for years for that memories. She grows up and she's determined to find slender man for probably not good reason, and then she gets 'infected' from him or something like that. congratulations."
ySy8mcceTno,Always watching no eyes
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man comes and says i did nat kill them i did nat
ySy8mcceTno,Obese Man + Diet = Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,A creepypasta became to the movie?wow.
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the fucking sense in this
ySy8mcceTno,Uh why? Where were you in 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,ya es tarde........................ 15 años tarde :v.jpg
ySy8mcceTno,"a lot of dislikes, I think I know enough"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't get it where's slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,is this a joke or a fanmade trailer because this trailer makes no sense
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought a movie like this will never come,  but look for years someone comes up with a brilliant idea."
ySy8mcceTno,One like=One creepy pasta member comes in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,don't disappoint me.
ySy8mcceTno,"They should have done this exactly ten years ago, when it was still a thing"
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like gouging my eye with scalpel too after subjecting it to this garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,Where's Warfstache when you need him?
ySy8mcceTno,"That's right folks, It's 2018 and a large studio has actually green lit the production of and completed a big budget film based of a fucking internet meme. I can't wait for what will surely be the best comedy film of the year"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG THAT LOOKS SO GOOD AND SCARY
ySy8mcceTno,"oh no, sloondermoon"
ySy8mcceTno,"The sequel is gonna be all about Splendorman

Stay Tuned"
ySy8mcceTno,2009 want's Slender Man back
ySy8mcceTno,Blender Man
ySy8mcceTno,This is basically bye bye man
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called it wants its horror game of the year back
ySy8mcceTno,I'm serious like what the freak is going on
ySy8mcceTno,I could see slender man reacting to this
ySy8mcceTno,Uhhh.... That 2015 thing??
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah.
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear Sony,
You're Ten years too fucking late (6 if you include Arrival). Stop trying to capitalize on dead things"
ySy8mcceTno,Why why why why WHY!?!
ySy8mcceTno,I hope pewdiepie is in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna suck lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Aso madreee no mames me  cagee puto
ySy8mcceTno,Just 3% of the trailer was about Slendy. Xd
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman.
Slenderman 2.

The Amazing Slenderman 1.
The Amazing Slenderman 2.
Slenderman: homecoming."
ySy8mcceTno,‘Ppl don’t just disappear........’ me: ya thy get kidnapped
ySy8mcceTno,Bro this movie is so late tf
ySy8mcceTno,Yay my fav person’s (slender) creepypasta is now turning into a movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Question: Uhm, Why does Slender man look like a raisin?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I can see him, but not John Cena."
ySy8mcceTno,Every horror moives have the main charector look away and when they look back there fucking there
ySy8mcceTno,What's next Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,eh. looks Promising
ySy8mcceTno,does it have anything to do with the game though ?
ySy8mcceTno,Bueno al menos estará en las manos de sony
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so lost
ySy8mcceTno,YOUR MAKING THIS NOW?!?!?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,This might be a really shity movie
ySy8mcceTno,Where's my emoji move 2
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,The light never dies! I wanna see this so bad XD
ySy8mcceTno,I have no idea what even happened in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be so disappointing.
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting for a Slenderman movie to come out for years but it's a bit late now, i'll still watch it tho."
ySy8mcceTno,"Is slender mad?






Let’s administer with a controlled shock"
ySy8mcceTno,Not bad trailer though but lets see how didssapointed we can be
ySy8mcceTno,espero que no me decepcione
ySy8mcceTno,Aquí soy el único que habla español :v?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks trash
ySy8mcceTno,"""BROTHER!"" 
-Pumkinhead 🎃"
ySy8mcceTno,"I dont like this at all, they tried to make slender man into someone he isnt. Why make him this psychological fuckface when he never was in any of the games. Make it simple and scary, like in the games"
ySy8mcceTno,RIP EARPHONE USEERS
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man: hey guys booga booga
ySy8mcceTno,Holy frik
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember when the story of slender man came out a few years ago, and I’m a horror fanatic so my first thought was this would make a good horror movie. Turns out, it doesn’t make a good horror movie. Not to mention they made this like 4-5 years after slender man was even a thing 🙃"
ySy8mcceTno,epic
ySy8mcceTno,this will flop
ySy8mcceTno,In the end I think she has one of the papers
ySy8mcceTno,So many people are going to dress up as slenderman and kill people after this movie.It'll be the new clown trend
ySy8mcceTno,Paul logan rated this movie; LOL FUNNY
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this
ySy8mcceTno,Got the chills
ySy8mcceTno,I’m excited 😆
ySy8mcceTno,Slendys proxy
ySy8mcceTno,im afraid the memes will be quite fully operational by the time of the films release
ySy8mcceTno,and i thought the game was scary....
ySy8mcceTno,seems kind of weird but I'd still see it since it's slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Just why
ySy8mcceTno,lmao noob use ur flashlight
ySy8mcceTno,this is a bad idea.
ySy8mcceTno,"This was a meme, now look at it, a meme movie yippee"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m actually kind of interested in how they’ll make a movie on a character with really vague lore
ySy8mcceTno,im i the only one who is getting stranger things vibes?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman the movie; featuring a child some background characters and everyone but fucking slenderman
""Can you see him"" of course I goddamn can't"
ySy8mcceTno,We need a movie about SCP Containment Breach that would be awesome!
ySy8mcceTno,Reminds me of the video from the Ring....
ySy8mcceTno,para ir con mi novia >:3
ySy8mcceTno,What kind of a crappy movie is this? This is not slender man at all.
ySy8mcceTno,Do you no de wey?
ySy8mcceTno,"Before - Cool but... 6 years late!

After- Sony made this... all hope is lost"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap this is way overdue.
ySy8mcceTno,"Spoiler For the Ending

*Slenderman takes his mask off*

Logan paul: MAKE SURE YOU SUBSRIBE AND LIKE THE VIDEO"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg wow and it’s a real movie now! Awesome!
ySy8mcceTno,All the creepypastards are getting wet right now.
ySy8mcceTno,"*Is this gonna be on Netflix, someone please reply.*"
ySy8mcceTno,Release Date May 18 2018 in the USA
ySy8mcceTno,"After being touched constantly by Uncle Dave,nothing scares me anymore."
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê o slender man ?
ySy8mcceTno,"I am actually really hyped! May be late but its keeping the creepypastas alive, I can't wait!I'm to happy for this.... .-."
ySy8mcceTno,This video made no sense
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t
ySy8mcceTno,just watch marble hornets ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ySy8mcceTno,Finay
ySy8mcceTno,Man they messed up slenderman majorly. He just chased you through the woods until you find the 8 papers and if he finds before you do he kills you thats it
ySy8mcceTno,Why just why
ySy8mcceTno,a very topical video seeing as no ones talked about slender man in like four years now. way to jump on the band wagon early fellas!
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time for a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fake
ySy8mcceTno,"Why do we need this, MarbleHornets did it better like 6 years ago."
ySy8mcceTno,"For a society that always talks about teen suicide being terrible and horrible, there sure is a lot of teens hurting themselves in this trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,This actually might be scary
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late.
ySy8mcceTno,Let's all hope they don't butcher a good creepypasta.
ySy8mcceTno,now where's my Borrasca movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is the next emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,They must think we are all children. Who doesn't love spooky flashing images and baby's crying?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!!! His movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Yiğit alp cavdar abim nerde amk yalan bu
ySy8mcceTno,Why didn't they do this earlier though..?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a crap straight to DVD ring sequel... oh wait rings already did that basically
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,#toolatetotheparty
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman!!! E esperado que saquen una película de el y si por fin >:'V podré morir en paz
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm sorry, who is Slender Man?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh no......


SONY IS STRIKING BACK!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see this just because everyone calls me him
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember a couple of kids that I knew did a slender man fan film, I think they did better than the trailer, even though it’s a trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo le agarre cariño a Slender por el cómic de Rubius <3
ySy8mcceTno,C mamut
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"Betting my left nut that this is gonna be another 4/10 - that they manage to ruin a perfectly cruel myth by having us think ""wtf?"".

I'm betting my left nut 'cuz I know I'm right on this."
ySy8mcceTno,"How much better would this movie be if it is a psychological horror movie about the myth of Slender man, like we are following those super fans of him. Like with that girl that stabbed the other, those kind."
ySy8mcceTno,Bad
ySy8mcceTno,i feel like I'm going to get a phone call from some creepy little girl saying I'm going to die in seven days
ySy8mcceTno,im triggered from my 2012 flashbacks
ySy8mcceTno,The book was better
ySy8mcceTno,They've got it all wrong they need to look at the real slender man the German mythical creature that's in the black woods
ySy8mcceTno,I prefer killer bean
ySy8mcceTno,..so it’s actually happening this time...? No more bs? There’s actually a slender movie coming out now?
ySy8mcceTno,Well umm this is a bit late
ySy8mcceTno,Uuh hell yes
ySy8mcceTno,Never in my life have I wanted to see a movie so badly that I can critique it accurately afterwards.
ySy8mcceTno,"First off Slenderman died 5 years ago, second out of all the creepy pasta's why choose the one that has turned into a dead meme I mean Ben Drowned could of been an awesome found footage type of film or you could've done 1999 another candidate for a good found footage film, but last but certainly not least you could of done Penpal which is amazing and could of been great but we get this, an old dead meme turned into a feature length film"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg awesome!!
ySy8mcceTno,what's next jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,*The Happening 2*
ySy8mcceTno,"All I’m hoping is that this movie turns out DECENT. Not something amazing or great, but something that’s watchable. I actually do like the idea and story of slender man and it’s not that hard of a concept to understand in the first place, but I’m also not gonna be surprised if this ends up shitty."
ySy8mcceTno,#suckmyfuckingdick
ySy8mcceTno,The hell? Why?? ಠ_ಠ
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all are late just saying

ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this legit
ySy8mcceTno,from the people who brought you the emoji movie. . .
ySy8mcceTno,Guys the trailer makes no sense
ySy8mcceTno,Did they get the rights from the guy who made Slender on the forums??? Because the copyright owner is real
ySy8mcceTno,yeah slendermsn the moive
ySy8mcceTno,"‘You remember when that girl almost died?’
‘Yeah.’ 
‘’How can we make money off of that?’
‘Our team of idiots are working on it.’"
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypaster movie ☺
ySy8mcceTno,Still better than Logan Paul and his Logang.....
ySy8mcceTno,"Based on the trailer it doesn't seem like they did enough research into the effects Slenderman has on his victims and what's supposed to occur between them.  I don't think this movie will be good if you're picky about details like me.  The movie could still prove me wrong because I'm going to see it anyways, but right now the future isn't looking very bright."
ySy8mcceTno,Lel... oh Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Ive got chills oh my
ySy8mcceTno,5 years late. Congratulations you played yourself
ySy8mcceTno,Wow!  I didn't realize it's 2012 again!
ySy8mcceTno,That 70's look
ySy8mcceTno,You know there are real slender cases right? Its not a joke
ySy8mcceTno,U late boi
ySy8mcceTno,When you get an F and can't face your parents 1:32
ySy8mcceTno,Ummm. Slender man is kinda dead. He’s not scary anymore and now. It’s not even worth it. Also this isn’t a good plot kind of. It’s kinda confusing really. I know the story but this doesn’t make any sense and I don’t think this is right. I don’t think this follows him very well :P

ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman ya no competirá para los creepypastas, sino para las peliculas de terror :("
ySy8mcceTno,"Is MH going to be featured in this one?cause it will makethe slender,man worth watching😏....."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie doesn't even relate to the freakin game that not even a good plot
ySy8mcceTno,"First I liked this but then I realized I wouldve liked it more if 
1.the trailer mad since
2.they thought of this when slender man was actually popular
3.if they showed slender man in the trailer all we see is his sillowet"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man has not been relivent sence 2013
ySy8mcceTno,John Cena?
ySy8mcceTno,"If this happens to me I would just go to sleep my whole life... I mean if you look at him you die, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,The Emoji 😂Movie were scarier then this
ySy8mcceTno,"CALLING ALL THE CREEPY PASTA FANSSSSSSSSSS
#5yearslatesqaud"
ySy8mcceTno,Later than me on the first day of school
ySy8mcceTno,Basically The Emoji Movie 2
ySy8mcceTno,"So, what does this have to do with slender man?"
ySy8mcceTno,My ears
ySy8mcceTno,From the same company that released the emoji movie so they’re really in tune with the culture
ySy8mcceTno,"Simple word.








No."
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t say this is anything like the Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Time to revive a dead myth Woo woo
ySy8mcceTno,Huge & serious Creepypasta fans (including me): *HEAVY BREATHING*
ySy8mcceTno,This honestly looks like a fan made trailer from about 4-5 years ago lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Wow....just..wow.
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, they want their creepypasta back."
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, no one obviously found all 8 pages."
ySy8mcceTno,Ok Ok Ok But Where Is Slender Man In The Video ?
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all later than my puberty
ySy8mcceTno,Wow and I still can't get a bioshock movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m already disappointed at this movie. It would be better to have it be a Blair witch type feel, with all the cameras and stuff messing up around him"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh come on, The Silence were scarier then this"
ySy8mcceTno,"Why now? You are so late on this. And from what I can tell, your going to fail as hard as the emoji movie."
ySy8mcceTno,And there is gonna be a Five nights at Freddy's movie by Blumhouse Productions this year too? The year for Independent Horror Game movies I guess.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol ok
ySy8mcceTno,I think...your WAYYYY to late. The only way I'd watch this movie is if it had the Rock in it.
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't fall into the actual Slenderman Creepypasta Story
ySy8mcceTno,It would be better if marvel made it
ySy8mcceTno,#fucksony
ySy8mcceTno,Its about time 🔪
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like crap. Might as well go watch Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,You've gotta be kidding me.
ySy8mcceTno,creepypasta fandom bouta be shook
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look as bad as I had expected. Might check it out
ySy8mcceTno,depois desse trailer eu sei que tudo é possivel
ySy8mcceTno,At 1:04 is she giving birth ?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie may make way for SCP'S.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yea skin man time
ySy8mcceTno,"I bet they've been working on this for years 

To be honest it looks really good"
ySy8mcceTno,"Thank you, now I am in the mood watching idubbbz slenderman gangnam style."
ySy8mcceTno,Probably made this after the news about the girls who stabbed another girl for slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Strangers Things knockoff ... it's gonna sucks!
ySy8mcceTno,But where is slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man came from the goons at something awful.
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is horrifying because the original Slenderman got people to do crazy stuff like this in really life.
ySy8mcceTno,cade os HUEHUE??
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if they are going to mention the two girls who almost killed their friend
ySy8mcceTno,#GIMME20DOLLARS
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should of been made years ago and looks cheaply done smh...
ySy8mcceTno,What is coming soon ? Early 2019 or like late 2018?
ySy8mcceTno,All the money this movie will make is from the 6-12 year olds
ySy8mcceTno,Para nada que ver con la historia de slendi
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,uh oh
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait, this isn’t like a fake trailer from my childhood? This is an actual trailer?
I need a minute"
ySy8mcceTno,Internet Explorer
ySy8mcceTno,:u tiene que datme miedo ?
ySy8mcceTno,*god has left the server*
ySy8mcceTno,this trailer doesn’t really show the slenderman lore it just looks like a psychological horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the symbol
ySy8mcceTno,It better be good cuz slender man was my fucking childhood game
ySy8mcceTno,The only question I have is why did the girl stab her self in the head and no one tried to stop her???
ySy8mcceTno,Wea más penca que la reconchetumare
ySy8mcceTno,I need to watch this 😄😄😄
ySy8mcceTno,no la vallas a cagar >:v
ySy8mcceTno,If Ian and/ or gangnam style doesnt get a easter egg in this then is it really worth the title of slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,Watch the movie become static the whole time because its Slender Man. ;)
ySy8mcceTno,"It's all in a day's work, for Jack Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,YUUUUSS FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Eh I guess I’ll watch it just to understand  the trailer more but this movie might just have a horrible trailer that can’t really describe the movie but who knows
ySy8mcceTno,Let the Marble Hornets crew take care of this one
ySy8mcceTno,Solo hubo una puta escena donde mostraron las notas y no fue en el bosque >:(
ySy8mcceTno,"1:33 nice sound editing.
I mean, with all the stock sound effects here, they could atleast have bothered with a knife sound effect"
ySy8mcceTno,I clicked this thinking it said spider man....BOY WAS I WRONG
ySy8mcceTno,tô emocionado tô esperando o filme
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone think the actors in the movie even know who slender man is?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony: This is a great idea! All the other games turned into movies worked out great, just look at World of Warcraft. 

Public and Critics: 😑"
ySy8mcceTno,8 years late i suppose
ySy8mcceTno,Doesnt make sense
ySy8mcceTno,"I am not saying this film is going to be good, nor am I saying that this film is going to be bad, I just have two problems. First being what most people are saying with them being late. Admittedly it does take time to make a film but this is just to late. The second problem is the two girls who nearly killed their friend for ""slender man"". I can not remember the names but this might not be the best way of spending your money Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Why just why
ySy8mcceTno,Vele amınakoğayım bıne biçim filim
ySy8mcceTno,Bad trailers 101
ySy8mcceTno,im actually very interested to see where this is going
ySy8mcceTno,No mames no mames meboy  a ver esaaa boy a llorar aaaaaaaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,1:43 he is standing right over her right shoulder... OHHH HELL NO!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This was based on a true story y'all  remember the slender man stabbing insidint?
ySy8mcceTno,"Turn around and run, slender man is powerless if you do that"
ySy8mcceTno,loooks really good
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,Just start from the last fucking checkpoint
ySy8mcceTno,And... Where is the suit??
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,You're going to screw this movie up.
ySy8mcceTno,No 8 pages. Slender man KILLs the children and no one even cares about him anymore. What a way to waste a good title
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years later they finally make a real movie.

I shouldn’t hate because I’m definitely watching it"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:23 Omg littlekuriboh was right, there IS a gay elephant noise! XD 

I have no regrets"
ySy8mcceTno,Somewhere in those woods you can hear Logan Paul laughing and screaming “WE FOUND A DEAD BODY”
ySy8mcceTno,"A woman writes "" HIM "". I wonder how many radical feminists will get triggered."
ySy8mcceTno,DOPE
ySy8mcceTno,#ICantFuckingSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"Bet you guys that in the whole movie we're only going to see slender man twice, once he'll be so out of focus you'll barely see him"
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this remind me of the ring? With all the bugs and flashing and horrific pics.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol 😝 slender isn’t show in this it looks more like the grudge trailer than slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Who else thought it was Spider Man??? 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,This is taking fashionably late to a new level...
ySy8mcceTno,Considering how late this was to the party I guess we'll get a Five Nights at Freddy's movie in about... 4 years or so.
ySy8mcceTno,"There were parts that looked pretty cheesy but to be honest most horror movies look cheesy these days. This looks like it could take an interesting perspective on slender man, anyone with me?"
ySy8mcceTno,Si es real podría valer una fortuna :v
ySy8mcceTno,I liked this fandom but you're like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna make the game look so bad
ySy8mcceTno,What am I watching
ySy8mcceTno,this just looks like a really shitty american horror story trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,??
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,You got to think this is bad just wait until the fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,I still think fandoms are more scary than this.
ySy8mcceTno,I hate the trailers before trailers now...  Does the studio think that everyone has the attention span of a hummingbird?
ySy8mcceTno,All the 12 year old girls with their ipads will want to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"they are going on a whole different path, a bad path, with this movie. its stupid because this inst actually slender-man its their own version that to me looks stupid and i hate that they think this is a good way to do it. the trailer already says so much about what the slender-man character does and that not what he does. the biggest thing in my opinion is the ability to mind control it looks like which is dumb because he can not mind control."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm happy this is coming out after the Slender boner five years ago died down tbh.
ySy8mcceTno,You need the pages in the movie and in the trailer please
ySy8mcceTno,I remember being like 7 when the whole slender man thing started now it’s 2018 SONY YOU GUYS ARE 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Probably one of the laziest horror trailers I’ve ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,hey weres fnaf the movie >:(
ySy8mcceTno,looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,My videoes are better than this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus this looks shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,My lord thanks
ySy8mcceTno,"It's exciting to finally have a real slender man movie but your kinda late to the party, Sony... OH CRAP IT'S MADE BY SONY"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this fad is so over
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,"yea y'all.....dont even know who or what slenderman is y'all dont even know how he actually behaves. Sony, what if you actually used Slenderman fans in your late movie rather than models"
ySy8mcceTno,And this trailer is weird
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is a bit... Late.
ySy8mcceTno,What is slender man again?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is actually Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,i dont remember THIS from the creepypasta....
ySy8mcceTno,You good man sony
ySy8mcceTno,You just never know with Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,What about the noise he makes when he's near by?
ySy8mcceTno,This would’ve been a lot better if they stuck with what they knew about slender man instead of throwing that out of the window and shitting out this god awful story
ySy8mcceTno,Hey atleast it's not emoji movie two
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!
ySy8mcceTno,There should have made five nights at Freddys instead of this
ySy8mcceTno,Good movie but u got to realize sony produced the emoji movie😕
ySy8mcceTno,This looks kinda trash
ySy8mcceTno,This is like nothing from slender
ySy8mcceTno,that moment when your 2012 game is so good they make another game a year later and than make a movie 5 FUCKING YEARS LATER!
ySy8mcceTno,But no one cares about Slenderman anymore
ySy8mcceTno,When will Sony quit shitting out these godawful try hard films?
ySy8mcceTno,Im 99.9% sure Sony hasn’t read one creepypasta or watched Marble hornets or any other slenderman themed anything.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm mad
ySy8mcceTno,"You are late Sony, very late, oh what did you say? You just want sum cash, ok cool"
ySy8mcceTno,"People are saying how this movie is late and they're just doing it for the money, but I'm honestly excited, it reminds me of Blair Witch."
ySy8mcceTno,Another shitty horror movie it seems lol
ySy8mcceTno,Q bosta vey
ySy8mcceTno,lol now we wait for someone in real copying the moving and going to jail
ySy8mcceTno,Mmmmm no.
ySy8mcceTno,"To the people complaining that they’re “six years late”, I’m sorry filmmakers weren’t aware that certain trends had expiration dates."
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like very little slender man for a slender man film....great job Hollywood
ySy8mcceTno,This is just...so pathetic
ySy8mcceTno,...
ySy8mcceTno,"Look.. Don't judge me, but.. I'm low-key hype for this. Now I'm waiting on a Jeff the Killer one."
ySy8mcceTno,eu sou gay
ySy8mcceTno,Yo this trailer using the assassin creed 3 bells😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,No like it not even scary and this thalier was boo avengers is going to be good than this
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Sony finally made it
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it said spider man :3
ySy8mcceTno,"The Slender hype died down, so..Nice timing- still look forward to seeing it though"
ySy8mcceTno,"Bu Slenderman değil Süleymander
*Türkler +1*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man, yea he know de way"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo this would've been dope.......in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Man: Aaahah! Please don’t kill me! *runs away*
Slenderman: Why are you running? I just want a friend! *sighs* Why does everybody run away from me?"
ySy8mcceTno,Quando que sai nos cinemas?
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this was gonna be a fake trailer from a catfish account, but no it's the real thing. I do agree that there is a lot of random disturbing images, either to cover up most of the plot while still somehow being relevant or is there just as a filler because they have a shitty/not relevant plot that wouldn't make sense in the trailer. I do hope that my, and many others, expectations are met for this movie as I never thought this day would come. I am honestly exited and don't want to be disappointed by money hungry faggots, if you Are, not saying you Are, I hope this will be good."
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah...... I’m good.....
ySy8mcceTno,Si sony pone un tráiler de slendi tonces ahi que creer wooo
ySy8mcceTno,better late than never!
ySy8mcceTno,"you guys are about 6 years too late, well spend money lmao"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like an excessive student film.
ySy8mcceTno,tengo que verlo ya!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Do you know *de wae?*
ySy8mcceTno,This looks cheesy af
ySy8mcceTno,This shits better than the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I never cared about Slenderman, because I wasn't a kid or teen when he was around. But this might be good. As a scary movie with jump scares. But as I understand Slenderman, it looks like they got it wrong. I thought people just disappeared, or are found dead, not taken over like zombies. What's more, it would be a no-brainer to incorporate Slenderman as an internet creation, or myth. And include real videos, or recreations, of some of the ones I saw way back when."
ySy8mcceTno,2012?
ySy8mcceTno,"Too little, too late, Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,ta parecendo o filme da exorcista
ySy8mcceTno,Time to put that on the list of movies I need to see
ySy8mcceTno,"como soy pendejo igualmente la vere....pero les digo algo, EL PUTO SLENDER QUE AQUI SE PRESENTA NO ES EL SLENDER QUE CONOCEMOS!!!, los que lo conocemos del 2012 hacia delante SABEN que no hace ni provoca esas cosas............hay lo dejo....."
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't saw slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my God I am so happy to see a Slender Man movie!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Awsome
ySy8mcceTno,"slender man, slender man, does whatever a slender man does, can he kill from the woods, yes he can he's slender man LOOK OUT he's slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,"IF THEY CAN MAKE A SLENDERMAN MOVIE, THEY CAN MAKE A FNAF MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,Oha mk
ySy8mcceTno,Fake or na
ySy8mcceTno,At lest it's not an Emoji Movie sequel
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony is five years late, Warner brothers is gonna be 6 years late once 5 nights comes out"
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe not the best thing to release after two girls killed their best friend to be approved by “Slenderman”
ySy8mcceTno,This is a really shitty trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Just remember the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"There only in the woods once , no pages or nothing. I’m good G"
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMAN YOU SHOULD BE A NBA PLAYER BRO
ySy8mcceTno,This is exactly the same as the game
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty good actually
ySy8mcceTno,Here come the 12 year olds
ySy8mcceTno,"Dang its one of those psychological horror movies. This is not the best looking movie. Then again, the only other plot I could could think of for this movie is basically a ripoff of the Blair witch"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow so cool BTWs big fan of scary movies except for Halloween staring Mycle Miyers 😱
ySy8mcceTno,Single undertake danger scare leave marry verbal central contribution since
ySy8mcceTno,"So much is wrong. If he gets close you have a cough attack. He targets children and kidnaps them. Not... makes them insane. If you saw him, no matter your age though, he will come for you"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t this like five years late
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda like it
ySy8mcceTno,too much words said in trailer 2/10
ySy8mcceTno,I can't  wait to see slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman at 2:14
#IFoundHim"
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Logan Paul recorded the part where the kid jumps off the bridge
ySy8mcceTno,This looks soo wack
ySy8mcceTno,Do a jeff the killer movie or slender vs jeff
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man, slender man, does what ever a slender can, can he jump from behind—
YES HE CAN AAAAHHHHHH"
ySy8mcceTno,jumps and jumps and jumps and jumps and are you scared yet lol its slender man
ySy8mcceTno,6 Years late.... yup.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ssssssoooooo is there supposed to be a plot? No? Okay, didn't think so."
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is just trying to find dah way bruddah
ySy8mcceTno,All I’m waiting for is a Logan Paul Camino where in the background there’s someone hanging and he’s just there vloging it
ySy8mcceTno,#Youcan'tSeeme
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly think this will be the only good movie based on a videogame.
ySy8mcceTno,sorry but we ain’t doing this slenderman thing again goodbye
ySy8mcceTno,La cagas y te mato cabron
ySy8mcceTno,Lol should have made this in 2010
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah of course I’ve seen him he’s not fucking John Cena
ySy8mcceTno,Late stupid almost nothing like it trailer showed the movie is not at all like the game based of a huge internet obsession looks like a ring knock off why was there weird black vines why did that person stab her eye with a scalpel and how did it bleed why was there a giggling baby. I say this movie is trash. Also the trailer is trash
ySy8mcceTno,*FINALLY*
ySy8mcceTno,"Who else wants to see this on the big screen, also I hope it isn’t R"
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh I cant see him BECAUSE YOU DIDNT SHOW HIM. its not like he's john cena or anything
ySy8mcceTno,The eerie music makes these type of horror movies good
ySy8mcceTno,don't you just love when sony ruins a good thing
ySy8mcceTno,C R I N G E
ySy8mcceTno,oh boi can’t wait for the fuckin creepy pasta cinematic universe that’s 8 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Why are there 22k dislikes?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh for fucks sake your a bit late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,dont put hate on tha movie maybe just need a opportunity
ySy8mcceTno,They should make Abandoned By Disney into a movie next
ySy8mcceTno,This will either be the best or the worst horror movie ever made.
ySy8mcceTno,ooooo   not a tall skinny man
ySy8mcceTno,#SlenderSickness
ySy8mcceTno,This is a trailer or MK ULTRA EXPERIMENTS 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry Sony Slenderman bullshit died like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Nokkasiili
ySy8mcceTno,Hapy 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Its film is very very........ CREEPYYY
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder who's gonna get stabbed
ySy8mcceTno,"is it wrong that I feel like the people who are asking why are dumb, it takes years to film movies. A movie may be relevant when they start filming and production, but by the time it gets closer to release that specific topic might not be relevant anymore. That being said, at that point they probably had too much money invested in it to just drop the project altogether."
ySy8mcceTno,Surprisingly good trailer. Most trailers these days are awful and contrived.
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be the 7th best horror film of 2012...
ySy8mcceTno,Yoooo... Why am I fearless yo?... I wanna enjoy horror movies and get scared too...
ySy8mcceTno,Ooook...... fan trailers were better
ySy8mcceTno,Dead space pls
ySy8mcceTno,I still can't see him
ySy8mcceTno,"wow, this is going to suck"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony:okay the emoji movie wasn’t cool what else are kids talking about these days?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a teaser or is it real?if it's real I'm definitely going to watch it!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is going to be trash




Can’t wait to watch"
ySy8mcceTno,The only Slendman film production I know is Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,"Muy tarde....
15 años tarde"
ySy8mcceTno,Roses are red violets are blue we got i bad trailer an so did you
ySy8mcceTno,will he be wearing the suit?
ySy8mcceTno,"Your not supposed to see him moving, he is like a weeping angle, so not only are they late, but they got it wrong."
ySy8mcceTno,No friggin way
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is probably betther than the movie itself
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is probably betther than the movie itself
ySy8mcceTno,"YESSSS YES YES YES YESSS YESSSSS



YES YES FUCKING YESSS"
ySy8mcceTno,Is slender man the beast that's gonna be in stranger things 3 😮 . he just looks like it with all the arms
ySy8mcceTno,"2012/2013 - We need a slender movie.
2018 - Here’s that slender movie you wanted!
Me - A bit late Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Why not just play with the lights on
ySy8mcceTno,I get this was originally a creepy pasta. But what is the trend with turning Video Games into movies?
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,#Canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"Can't you guys  see 2018 is the year of creepy pasta.
 It's 2018 so 8 - 2 is 6
0+1 = 1
1 x 6 = 6
So we have 66
Now 6+6 = 12
12 / 2 = 6 ( i use 2 because we use TWO 6's to get 12)
So now we have 666
2018 = 666"
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this does not end like the emoji movie, I will attempt to stay open minded about this. Everyone please know that this may not end up like any sort of bad movie, but it may also have the chance of being bad. So everyone, just stay in a average mood."
ySy8mcceTno,Think I'll just go watch 'Marble Hornets' again instead..
ySy8mcceTno,so fake like the stabbing story about slender.This Movie is going to be on a low budget
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know what to expect from a company that bring us ""The Emoji Movie""..."
ySy8mcceTno,Took you guys long enough.
ySy8mcceTno,Espero con muchas ansias la pelicula espero que sea buena
ySy8mcceTno,Yasssssss finely
ySy8mcceTno,1:50 ns ustedes pero eslender no tenia la cara blanca?
ySy8mcceTno,Aren't their like 2 or 3 indie slender man movies out along with a video game for ps and xbox. Seriously bro😔😔😔
ySy8mcceTno,when
ySy8mcceTno,"The Poor Man's Skellington Jack ladies and gentlemen!!! I'm sorry, I know it's an insult to put the 2 in the smae sentence!"
ySy8mcceTno,Avete presente qui film brutti? Ecco
ySy8mcceTno,Why isn’t slender man dead yet. And in this trailer slenderman is a woman but in the arrival there is a Easter egg that shows that a boy is slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Your are too late for slender man but I hope it's going to be good.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this legit...?
ySy8mcceTno,Классно подрочил !
ySy8mcceTno,Sony I think your like 5 it 6 years late 😁😁👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,Seems legit .u.
ySy8mcceTno,Okay but DOES SHE HAVE TO FIND EIGHT PAGES
ySy8mcceTno,"""From the people that brought you Satans own Nightmare, the Emoji Movie"""
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 6 years late. Slender man isn’t a big deal anymore
ySy8mcceTno,Sony it's mr king's IT meet blair which meets rings
ySy8mcceTno,Honsetly looks pretty good
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the person that originally came up with the idea got paid for his or her work. Plus this looks like cannon fodder
ySy8mcceTno,Needs more camera and game play stuff like a guy with a camera walking around
ySy8mcceTno,"""You guys are late""
So what piss off it might be good"
ySy8mcceTno,Probably 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Lol Slenderman with black face lmfao
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,OHHHHH
ySy8mcceTno,"Ahh another white film that's not scary, yall should switch to asian scary movies js"
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is the whole movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know how this will play out, but god that was a terrible trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,"You are out of ideas, admit it..."
ySy8mcceTno,#ICanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,He wanted and expected this
ySy8mcceTno,This don’t even look scary
ySy8mcceTno,Lo mismo hicieron con jeff the killer era una farsa
ySy8mcceTno,"Like 6 years too late, but honestly this movie looks promising"
ySy8mcceTno,THIS LOOKS AMAZING
ySy8mcceTno,should've gave him 20 dollars

ySy8mcceTno,#slendermanIsDead
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman movie , more like deep web movie
HA am I right"
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when i was 8 and slender man blew up. Did anyone else not be able to be in a dark room or sleep?
ySy8mcceTno,Uuuh sorry sony... youre 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Pls no
ySy8mcceTno,"Composed by the guy that makes the Game of Thrones soundtrack. Okay Sony, i'm in."

ySy8mcceTno,please dont ruin slender for me
ySy8mcceTno,cOoL
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my god.
ySy8mcceTno,"Huh. At 1:39 you can see that when the girl looks over at slendy, she goes back to the tree, but the tree looks larger than before. Is that trying to show that Slendo is already right there beside her? That would make sense considering the next scene, but i hope that they don’t just make it a jumpscare like this shows..."
ySy8mcceTno,WACK
ySy8mcceTno,so she picks up the nife up in class to stab her self guess she had to grab that pokemon
ySy8mcceTno,Tactical flop incoming
ySy8mcceTno,Why did you did this
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,Why so many dislikes? :D
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know how to feel about this, they are years late and most horror movies have that same cliche where you're gonna predict what happens next, I didn't even get jump scared cause this was so predictable. I don't know, maybe it'll be good."
ySy8mcceTno,Late 6 years??
ySy8mcceTno,marble hornets came out several years ago and had a much sexier story than this by not calling slender man fucking Slender Man. goodbye
ySy8mcceTno,"they better not hide the gore / blood, if Slender man is in this, i wanna see LOTS of blood!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Top 5 Pedos in history

ySy8mcceTno,"Sooo... i hope they got the facts from creepy pasta. Cause wow are they late . Theres the russian sleep experiments , slender man , the midnight game (DO NOT PLAY), jeff the killer etc.."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man will never be the same

ySy8mcceTno,Yo can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,This might have had real traction almost a decade ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Me vuele a que va a ser igual de mierda que la de dead note de netflix
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone even talk about Slenderman anymore though?
ySy8mcceTno,I was expecting this and was not impressed
ySy8mcceTno,WHERE THE HELL HAS THIS BEEN
ySy8mcceTno,Where was slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,I think we're seeing a trend here. LACK OF ORIGINAL CONTENT
ySy8mcceTno,Anuma me hicieron una película xd
ySy8mcceTno,-Cool-
ySy8mcceTno,"A bit late don’t you think, but interesting someone is finally doing this"
ySy8mcceTno,Would’ve been an actual good movie if they had gone for a more psychological approach like the games went for BUT NOPE! Sony just had to make it another FUCKING JUMPSCARE FEST! Jason X is more scary than this!
ySy8mcceTno,You're a meme sony.
ySy8mcceTno,ABOUT TIME.
ySy8mcceTno,"So Slendy is finally getting his own movie, huh? Sweet!"
ySy8mcceTno,WTF slenderman was in the trailer for like 10 seconds
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji Movie or This lmao.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it has nothing to do with Slender..
ySy8mcceTno,This was honestly so creepy
ySy8mcceTno,What else?  Minecraft Herobrine the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Im 8 years old and i watch scary movies with my dad all the time leave a reply if u want to let me know what u think
ySy8mcceTno,Wow. Is this 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Don't mind me. Just a positive comment passing through lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Am i the only one who think its spiderman trailer for the first time??
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes finally, I hope the keep it accurate to comics"
ySy8mcceTno,THERE HE IS! SLENDER MAN! HOW DID YOU BECOME ADDICTED TO HEROINE!?!?!?
ySy8mcceTno,"Just like the Friday 13th game, several years too late.

Swbf2 was a flop, but unlike games you can’t update a film to make it right."
ySy8mcceTno,"SLENDER MAN
 the best horror movie of 2011"
ySy8mcceTno,"never checked my watch during a trailer before, grats sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"No entiendo por que la gente dice que SlenderMan llegará 5 años después, después de qué? Es un personaje que durará toda la vida, que no lancen nuevos videojuegos es cuestión aparte #IWantToSeeSlenderManMovie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Better late than never, I suppose."
ySy8mcceTno,lmao theyre so late
ySy8mcceTno,YES FINALLY A SLENDER MAN HORROR MOVIE=>
ySy8mcceTno,This looks real stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Now we need someone to start on a Jeff the killer movie. Then make a crossover of the two
ySy8mcceTno,Aquí vamos otra vez como con emoji :I ya valió verga esto
ySy8mcceTno,okay but why
ySy8mcceTno,"so tell me, who at sony pissed off slenderman so badly that they had to go out of their way to make this low budget movie in hopes that they rake in the 20$ he needs to pay him off?"
ySy8mcceTno,I never understood the appeal of Slender Man. How is he even scary?
ySy8mcceTno,SHIT......I never known this would come out sooner!
ySy8mcceTno,What's next Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,"bless this
I need more garbage in my life"
ySy8mcceTno,were actually getting one?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya screwed it up again, first the emoji movie, now THIS. SLENDERMAN IS A dead creepypasta you know!!! And will you excuse me. I'm gonna play GTA IV"
ySy8mcceTno,DO SCP CONTAINMENT BREACH PLEASE
ySy8mcceTno,1:22 is the venom symbiote in this movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I'd be hyped if it was 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,Dicks out for harambe
ySy8mcceTno,"It kinda just seems like the ring, but with slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,OOf
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie is going to be a disappointment
ySy8mcceTno,1:15 That clip is boomeranged. That's some high production quality lol
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this movie fails so bad that it will make the emoji movie and MLP the movie the reason why there better than this movie,   Sony, your running out of ideas AGAIN!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,I am disappoint
ySy8mcceTno,Can we just ignore sony pictures
ySy8mcceTno,Man this looks stupid!
ySy8mcceTno,LOL what?
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm sorry, this looks really bad and this is just the trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,At least I'm glad they didn't reveal him
ySy8mcceTno,*movie about SM* Only appears once in trailer
ySy8mcceTno,What kind of superhero slender man is?
ySy8mcceTno,"cant wait for this fanmade film....#Sonylateasfuck 
BUT
doesnt stop me for giving it a try"
ySy8mcceTno,The emoji movie kind of killed Sony for me.
ySy8mcceTno,Who's been reading the slenderman fanfiction
ySy8mcceTno,The HBO documentary Beware the Slenderman is the only good movie Slendy is ever gonna be in.
ySy8mcceTno,Wait is this fo real?
ySy8mcceTno,O slender no brasil n ia dar certo
ySy8mcceTno,This really makes me appreciate the documentary a lot more...
ySy8mcceTno,PewDiePie Has joined the server
ySy8mcceTno,"Cagala cabron, y te mato.jpg"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh wow, that's all the tropes.  That's every horror trope in one trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,*#LoganPaulSucks*
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been good in 2012 not 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when Marble Hornets made the best Slenderman movie in 2009?
ySy8mcceTno,"Waited for ""Gimme twenty dollas!"""
ySy8mcceTno,Wow the graphics are breathtak... wait it’s a movie!? WTF!? Why?
ySy8mcceTno,Kind of late sony
ySy8mcceTno,Já tô ansioso
ySy8mcceTno,I hates horror movie but I want to watch these bcoz I'm a fan of creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t the slender man trend end in like 2009?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Sony first Emoji Movie now this?
ySy8mcceTno,that will be so good
ySy8mcceTno,Is it going to be like a Godzilla movie where you only see him for a couple of seconds?
ySy8mcceTno,OPA GANGNAM STYLE!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Minecraft is gonna sue you guys for putting endermen in your movie
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really good. Slender Man deserves his own movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Espero que la hagan bien, porque con el trailer c mamut"
ySy8mcceTno,Why is it I see a tun of slender man movies but no Jeff the killer or smile dog or like any of those creepy pasta comment down below ur theory
ySy8mcceTno,:'3
ySy8mcceTno,So many cringy 14 yr olds in the comment section
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony: quick come up with movie ideas 
Ed: I got it.... fucking slender man 
Sony:🤑"
ySy8mcceTno,Gimme 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,Sony uses Internet Explorer
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender came out in 2009, shoulda thought of a movie a long time ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Cool actually no looks like dog sh**
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who doesn’t find it scary ?
ySy8mcceTno,Hello there. I'm here in order to you all I have an amazing idea for an action movie.
ySy8mcceTno,From a creepypasta to a legend..
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not seeing much Slender man in the Slender man trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I played the game and it scared me I know that watching the movie is gonna scare me too
ySy8mcceTno,Wow so an adult legend or myth is picked up and made into a horror just like that? Huh who knew?
ySy8mcceTno,"So.. idk but.. i feel that nothing of the trailer has to do with slenderman.. i mean virus, mind control.. nothing that i feel with slendy.."
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m sorta exited to see what they do with the slender man character, i’m just praying that they don’t make it a cheap jumpscare fest. I think that slender is all about the tension, knowing that he is there watching you and you have no idea where he is.

All in all i have high hopes for this film and fingers crossed its good."
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger Things Season 1 was probably the closes thing we could get to a good Slender Man Movie. They should make a Slender Man Movie not from the perspective of one main Character but many.
ySy8mcceTno,Brandon Ingram will make his movie debut
ySy8mcceTno,Idk how to feel bc I like the look of this movie and the weird little scenes satisfy me but like idk how good the plots gonna be
ySy8mcceTno,"1:51 ""Hey Guys!  Booga booga!"""
ySy8mcceTno,After all these years! :')
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this was supposed to be the slender man movie not a Logan Paul vlog

*sees the slender man

Oh now I see it’s just a crappy Sony movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"I think they should have made a movie about the real life two girls who killed a third for slender man here in Wisconsin. I read an article about an interview and investigation into her life and it's insane. The girl went insane, it's worth a google. Also, why isn't this slender man wearing a suit? Or a white mask? Like what???"
ySy8mcceTno,"A bit late, and guaranteed to stray far from the actual mythos of the character."
ySy8mcceTno,"just like every other horror movie trailer- its has ""dramatic music"", ""no talking"", ""and complete silence at the end with the title of it"".........  Back in the day it was ""silence with no music"", ""lots of screams and talking"", ""then a guy with the same voice saying the title, with a (in imax and 3D""."
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know what I'm watching and I don't know what any of this has to do with slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,só falta fazerem um filme da jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,jack skellington as sender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting for another murder
ySy8mcceTno,Cara isso é muito bom 👽👽👽 Quero logo ver o filme...
ySy8mcceTno,I thought they canceled it
ySy8mcceTno,Welp where doomed
ySy8mcceTno,"So instead of Popeye, you release a movie about a shitty old game"
ySy8mcceTno,Is only this was in 2012 oh wait Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,slender is back oh my gosh this is awsome man
ySy8mcceTno,espero que sea una duena pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,"What about a .......nah I'll tell Blum house
Also I guess this is like the ring"
ySy8mcceTno,This whole thing reminded me of the rings like  if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,"This is one of those movies where the trailer is scarier than the actual movie, mark my words. It looks spooky but the actual movie won't make any sense to the actual Slender Man story. I'll pass."
ySy8mcceTno,Horror is a dead genre... no more money!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Just give the man 20 dollars, and be done with it!"
ySy8mcceTno,ew
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhh 2012
ySy8mcceTno,it's not as scary as i exspect
ySy8mcceTno,WAY too late!
ySy8mcceTno,From the creators of the emoji movie👌
ySy8mcceTno,"Muy tarde Sony, 15 años tarde.jpg"
ySy8mcceTno,"Where the heck is Troy Wagner? Sheesh, he should at least make a cameo, y'know, because he invented all of the Slenderman crap and he made Marble Hornets... Sigh."
ySy8mcceTno,The famous old creepypasta has been revealed in cinema
ySy8mcceTno,From the same people who bought you the Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this going to be rated r
ySy8mcceTno,"Why can’t a slender man movie be like, mysterious scary, instead of in-your-face bullshit scary that all crappy horror is."
ySy8mcceTno,Lola nc trailer but deadly awsome creepy roo
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony your 6 years late to the game, also it does not really look that good earthier it doesn’t give the thrill."
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes yes , my creepy pasta fantasy will be real"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is getting worse.
ySy8mcceTno,I like horror and i think this would be better if we do this like everyone knows the girl go woods and find notes and slender man takes him that would be better🤔
ySy8mcceTno,"It would be more scary if that crazy Katie girl would be there chasing them or if the story was about her.
Like the game"

ySy8mcceTno,Where is he?
ySy8mcceTno,It's a little late for this..
ySy8mcceTno,your about 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I’m more interested in a movie about the actual crimes and what happened to the kids and stuff.
ySy8mcceTno,“Always watching” looked better
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman 2: Electric Boogaloo
ySy8mcceTno,in the next trailer i want more slender
ySy8mcceTno,This is funny
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late😂
ySy8mcceTno,You know it is official when sony releaees trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Yea I don't know about this one. Probably just another shat horror film? Everyone says it will be awful and it might be. Just go watch the Marble Hornets movie
ySy8mcceTno,So is this gonna be a movie about finding 8 pages then getting killed anyway at the end?
ySy8mcceTno,Still rather re watch tribe twelve
ySy8mcceTno,boy wtf sony
ySy8mcceTno,It’s abit late like Sony
ySy8mcceTno,When Hollywood runs out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,Is it gonna be in the movie theaters 2018!!?? I can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,Que buen trailer!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Over 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,İs it fake
ySy8mcceTno,Sony keeps making premium movies! 🙈
ySy8mcceTno,Also when does slendy growl or doesn't look tall....who Evers making the film please make a new trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I feel sorry for everyone involved in this project.
ySy8mcceTno,Mmmm idk is it real cause the trailer had little of slendy
ySy8mcceTno,I hoped one day someone would make this
ySy8mcceTno,"there is a petition to stop the release of this movie.
do you agree with it ?"
ySy8mcceTno,Whats the slendermans orign?
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,its about time
ySy8mcceTno,There was already a slender man movie back when the creepypasta was revealed and people wanted a show and movie and a year later they made a movie and it surprisingly was successful!
ySy8mcceTno,HOLY JESUS YAAASSsS
ySy8mcceTno,"I know this story and the slender man doesn't get into teens or people's heads, he gets into children's heads and brings them to his wood in Russia this should not take place in America or in any woods. The woods his folktale comes from is in Russia. Also the backstory of him was, people thought this lady was a which so the man who snitched she strung to a log and with ropes pulled his arms and legs to the maximum ripping them out the socket. This trailer is  incorrect but I love the movie idea."
ySy8mcceTno,had to check my watch during this
ySy8mcceTno,Wait but why?
ySy8mcceTno,"Teens being murdered by an abnormaly tall and pale entity... sorry slendy, pennywise already did it"
ySy8mcceTno,oh no
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they made a movie about Slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,Would’ve been cooler if this movie was all found footage
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Scrap it and make an SCP cinematic universe. Lot more to work with there and hell you could add this dead trend to it as well. You guys love money so tease people with slender man for 10 years and then make a slender man movie or something.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean, i'm exited but...why now? Isn't it too late?"
ySy8mcceTno,What kinda of trailer is this? It doesn’t even tell a scene but shows a bunch of messy cuts
ySy8mcceTno,if it was like 2012 then /maybe/
ySy8mcceTno,How many pages are they supposed to collect in this?
ySy8mcceTno,*Im legally blind*
ySy8mcceTno,Freaky
ySy8mcceTno,Does it really matter how old slender man is to be honest
ySy8mcceTno,A little late
ySy8mcceTno,There really running out of ideas now
ySy8mcceTno,ABURRIDAAAAA
ySy8mcceTno,Im excited!
ySy8mcceTno,Süleymander o salaklar
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like the ring, stranger things, and saw combined"
ySy8mcceTno,"Good job, Sony, you’re taking a dead creepypasta and making a movie out of it."
ySy8mcceTno,At least it's not a Jeff the Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"this look like ""the ring"" trailler"
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s been way too long, but I’m happy to find out that the mysterious murdering mannequin in a tuxedo is now getting his own movie."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope he has his suit
ySy8mcceTno,الي جاي من ابو عطوان لايك😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,you can see 2 slenderman in 1:42 if you slow down the video
ySy8mcceTno,As I hate horror movies..this looks awful!
ySy8mcceTno,Looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,Now let's wait for the FNAF movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"People, why are you complaining? Yes, it is late, but it took Marvel decades to make their characters come to life. I don't see you complaining about them."
ySy8mcceTno,I would go see that
ySy8mcceTno,This is so bad. It isn't as good as i thought it would be.
ySy8mcceTno,Most wanted movie for 2011
ySy8mcceTno,That movie looked like it wontnbe worth it's money 😐
ySy8mcceTno,This is why fire bombing exists
ySy8mcceTno,日本人いる?
ySy8mcceTno,He is gonna be sorry once he mess with me
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Mah GAH!!!111
ySy8mcceTno,Has Sony ever realized and forgoten this movie is going to cause controversy. I mean look on Google there is a petition for this movie not to be shown in any theater.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real? Is it coming in theaters?
ySy8mcceTno,This reveal would have been more cool if Slender Man was still relevant
ySy8mcceTno,"next...
Moth Man (2020)
Big Foot (2021)
Little Green Man (2022)
Lizard Man (2023)

The Urban Legends Assemble (2024)"
ySy8mcceTno,the bit where that girl stabbed the knife into her eye just sent shivers down my spine
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to 2018 apperantly Sony still lives in 2010
ySy8mcceTno,Oof
ySy8mcceTno,*logan paul joined the session*
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy! I can't wait for Sony's ContentID bots to start flagging all the Slenderman videos they ripped off for this movie. Hey Victor Surge, sue somebody."
ySy8mcceTno,"Bet ya sheckles there's gonna be no references to Marble Hornets, Proxies, or any of the other BS and fluff. It'll sell, either way.."
ySy8mcceTno,This is fake because the trailer doesn’t show the director actors producers of the so called film
ySy8mcceTno,"(Slender Man takes mask off)

Oh, hi Logan!"
ySy8mcceTno,">2018
>Slenderman

What is this 2012?"
ySy8mcceTno,CAN YOU SEE ME NOW
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man said if this movie is that crazy than he is doing a face reveal
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait to see the Plinkett review on this hot garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Tovajkergetők ;)
ySy8mcceTno,Just when I thought we could get over this. I thought this was done. But here we are.
ySy8mcceTno,"Simple, burn the forest down."
ySy8mcceTno,I wouldn't laugh
ySy8mcceTno,I like this but why 7 or 8 years later ? Sony.exe has stoped
ySy8mcceTno,"slender man , great film ,"
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 oof
ySy8mcceTno,Sony..it's too late!
ySy8mcceTno,If someone dies in the forest by Slender Man is Logan Paul going too put it on his vlog?
ySy8mcceTno,WOW!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,good luck sleeping guys
ySy8mcceTno,Now.........LET THE SPINOFFS BEGIN
ySy8mcceTno,Who though it was a fan made
ySy8mcceTno,You know the movie will be trash if the first trailer is almost 3 minutes long
ySy8mcceTno,YALL SO LATE BUT IMA STILL WATCH IT LOL!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I have no clue why everyone is hating on this movie. I get it it’s late slender man is long gone and this movie has a high likely hood of being bad. It most likely was originally made to be released back around 2013 when it was still popular but when that girl was nearly murdered they delayed it until now it’s nothing new and you guys should settle down.
ySy8mcceTno,i'm scared. I mean it's going to be really bad if they didn't do any research about this thing.
ySy8mcceTno,WOW

ySy8mcceTno,...wtf that has nothing to do with slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,It looks Alright. Doesnt look like it fits with the original lore of the Slender Story But new ideas are always welcome.

ySy8mcceTno,"I mean, maybe a little refreshment of slender Man wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't mind hearing something about him again."
ySy8mcceTno,this movie better have a reference or cameo of youtubers who have played the game
ySy8mcceTno,This is such an inappropriate idea for a movie ever since those psycho girls tried murdering their friend in the name of Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Man just wanted a sandwich.
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t like what they’ve done, he should by completely white wearing a suite. Not a black monster."
ySy8mcceTno,This game came out like 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Years after everybody forgot about slender man, this."
ySy8mcceTno,"Why didn't they make this movie back when Slenderman was a thing? It's like making a movie about Pogs, 5 years after people stop caring about Pogs. This is such a bad idea I'm kinda surprised it's not a new Netflix Original."
ySy8mcceTno,No please no

ySy8mcceTno,Whats next jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,Based on a true story
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is based on jump scares. It's jump scare galore
ySy8mcceTno,The heck? Where's the iconic static we've been looking for? Anyone?
ySy8mcceTno,Where is logan paul?
ySy8mcceTno,Did they just spoil the ending?

ySy8mcceTno,Ohh. Nice!😄
ySy8mcceTno,IM gonna watch that movie
ySy8mcceTno,wow like 2012... cool
ySy8mcceTno,People are running out of ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,Did they start making this movie when the trend started?
ySy8mcceTno,Why this called Slender Man? This should be called Slender Woman right? For a second i thought this was a superhero movie!! Well I'm not gonna watch this crap!!
ySy8mcceTno,"The next movie they should make is SCP Containment Breach, now if done perfect THAT would be a great horror movie!"
ySy8mcceTno,SONY is a bit too late. This is making me think about the documentary about Slender Man. I'm glad I got out of the CreepyPasta phase before that happened a few years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe Logan Paul is slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who started thinking about Ring movies 'cause that start? 🌚😂

ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine the original creator of slender man relishing in his riches from creating an early 2000's no budget game
ySy8mcceTno,If you could not put a giggling baby going back and forth between each side of my headphones that would be great.

ySy8mcceTno,It looks like it's going to be a drag
ySy8mcceTno,Idk why people are hating on this so much. '5 years late'  isn't a very strong argument. Just appreciate this movie as a standalone horror film by itself and see where it goes
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting years for this
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Next time can you people make creepypasta movies with Jeff the killer eye less Jack I like creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,"YES,YES,YES...!!! Now its time for find the slenderman..."
ySy8mcceTno,Is pewds in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman still exists?
ySy8mcceTno,I've never been so excited oml
ySy8mcceTno,why does this exist
ySy8mcceTno,I️ know you lying
ySy8mcceTno,Brought to you by the good people at Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,"If you took the time and energy to comment about this being ""too late"" then I guarantee you are the kind of person that would have just commented that it was blatant pandering and cashing in on an internet trend if they made this when Slender Man was relevant."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would have been great 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Oh look it's Sony trying to make money off of stupid kids again!
ySy8mcceTno,Emmm...2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry y’all. 2018 is canceled. Let’s try again next year
ySy8mcceTno,This is not slender man

ySy8mcceTno,I'm kinda fangirling rn.....a part of me wants one of the creepypastas to make a cameo or like be mentioned.....like Jeff or EJ or even the proxies.
ySy8mcceTno,This is the worst preview I have ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,"nice try sony, nice try"
ySy8mcceTno,"YES! ITS FINALLY HAPPENING(a little late), BUT YES"
ySy8mcceTno,y tho
ySy8mcceTno,"looks much more promising, than expected...late, yeah, almost forgotten. Can still be great!"
ySy8mcceTno,"This seems like one of those netflix movies, not really a block buster movie. Not sure what they were trying to achieve with this sort of trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR 5 YEARS.
ySy8mcceTno,i think the girl at the end of trailer is kate the chaser
ySy8mcceTno,I swear if slender man isn't gonna be seen properly in this movie i'm so done with life and i'll jump out of the window for fucksake
ySy8mcceTno,So is this gonna be like “Always watching” or the marble hornets series? Or is it gonna be a spooky ghost story Ooga booga bullshit jump scare piece of steaming hot Hollywood crap
ySy8mcceTno,ITS COMMING GUYS AHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA
ySy8mcceTno,Can't fucking wait
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie should've been filmed the way Cloverfield was, it would've had the feel of the game and everything else this creatures legacy had built up"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this Legit??
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a money grabber more than something based off the game
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they do Russian sleep experiment next....  Or Expressionless....  That's quite an interesting story telling to explore... And don't need to be high budget film..cast an unknown(talented) people so that we do really believe the story..
ySy8mcceTno,*In 2020* JEFF THE KILLER THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,You had your chance waaaaay too long ago.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful.
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry Sony but by what I saw there’s just too many random things added to this for instance the weird scenes at the beginning . Like what does maggots have to do with slender man his   Symbol is his large figure and branch like tentacles not maggots. Sorry but it’s just weird that we all had to see that. Sorry I really am but I already don’t want to see this.
ySy8mcceTno,Trending in Hungary although the game came out very very long time ago
ySy8mcceTno,"A little late Sony......

Seems like it took 12 YEARS TO MAKE!"
ySy8mcceTno,Вау

ySy8mcceTno,I hate everything
ySy8mcceTno,this ur last catsh
ySy8mcceTno,Did they actually take anything from the lore like wtf is this
ySy8mcceTno,"Tbh I've never seen a horror movie. Sure, I've seen some thrillers that do not necessarily have to include paranormal activities and monsters and right now I'm not interested in watching one. I just wanted to see this trailer, but I can guarantee y'all that I will not watch the film when it comes out"
ySy8mcceTno,it is five years late but im still probably going to see it due to one how well it did on it i hope it goes well
ySy8mcceTno,no slenderman yes süleymander +1
ySy8mcceTno,Special guest :Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Wait...Is this movie for real?

ySy8mcceTno,"If this came out when Marble Hornets was really popular, then it'd be really good, but because the hype around Slenderman is almost non-existant, then no one is going to watch this."
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait to see this film and when I go to watch it. I am cosplaying as Slenderman. This will be fun.
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks a lot like you got slenderman mixed up with the rake, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,"i'm just hoping its not secretly about those 2 idiot teenagers who tried to blame slender man in order to get out of a prison sentence.  and if it really isn't they have to include the explanation of ""slender sickness"" and this time get it right. so people don't say ""oh its just about this person going insane, and slendermen is just the monster they hallucinate.""."
ySy8mcceTno,ITT People think Slenderman is from game
ySy8mcceTno,soooo they took slenderman and turned him into samara from the ring?

ySy8mcceTno,Slender is ded

ySy8mcceTno,Not gonna lie. Kinda hyped. In particular I hope this will help bring some of the other creepypastas into the limelight. I feel like SCP's could do really well as a TV show type thing.
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, the Slenderman Mythos is officially ruined.
Well done Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,bruh who's finna go to sleep and is watching this??😂😭
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, they want there let’s play back"
ySy8mcceTno,this is pretty much the same as the movie 'The Bye-Bye Man'
ySy8mcceTno,1:33 doki doki literature club
ySy8mcceTno,"99% of movie: edgy sh*t
1% of movie: slender man himself"
ySy8mcceTno,Valar Morghulis
ySy8mcceTno,"Ive waited so long for this. It really excites me, even if it is a few years late."
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm getting stranger things vibes, by watching this lol."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man behind.
me: ""HASAGI"""
ySy8mcceTno,Why more likes than dislikes guess a lot of idiots have watched this
ySy8mcceTno,"Not trying to diss on the film at all, but I want to point out a few things that don't really make the movie seem interesting to people who've played the original game and/or know the origin of Slenderman before there was ever a game w/ him.

First, there was very little dialogue in the trailer. That is off-putting to more than just Horror genre lovers. We need more than a few, very unsuccessful attempts at scaring us just from the trailer alone. This makes it seem as if the movie is going to literally only be the kids screaming, breathing, and running, with nary a gasp from the audience, unfortunately just like most other modern horror flicks out there.

Second, Slenderman was obviously just a tall, slim person in an outfit, with perhaps a tiny bit of CGI. With today's technology and modern techies, you would think the creators of this movie would try to go out and find a team that can make Slenderman... I don't know... A bit more *slender*? Take out the guy in the suit, go full CGI, and perhaps add a couple of tendrils to his back in a part of the movie, just like in the Slenderman games, so that Sony would have something to show in the trailer that would peak interest in most people. You'd have more nostalgic gamers, and even people besides Horror genre fans, rushing to buy tickets; not only to the first showing, but for many more after. Entire theaters could have been sold out if the creators had done a bit more research.

Third and last, most likely 95% if not 100% of the insects and other scenes of things that make us squirm in this trailer, will not actually be in the movie itself. It is only meant to make you feel more uneasy while watching the trailer - to, ironically, make you want to see more... Even the creepy-crawly parts. I don't know about you, but I want to see clips from the actual movie. They don't have to be the best of the best, such as the jumpscares, because then there would be no movie, but when I watch a trailer of a movie that peaks my interest at just the title alone... I hate being disappointed before I even watch the first 30 seconds.

All in all, I unfortunately don't think I'll be over-the-brim full of excitement when the film comes out; I believe I will be one of the people who will buy a ticket in advance, only so that I will have something to do that day. Needless to say, as both a horror film fanatic and a gamer by religion, I don't think this is the movie for me. However, I cannot say no to ""Slendy"". ;-)

Let me know what *you* think of this trailer below. Will you buy a ticket?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Late AF




Better late than never? Ehh... for Sony, never is better than late when it comes to movies"
ySy8mcceTno,"I am more excited to see Cinema Sins roast the movie after it's released, lol"
ySy8mcceTno,The game came out like 7 years ago...
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else get The Ring vibe with the random shots of maggots and stuff?
ySy8mcceTno,"This doubles as a video game movie, right? So it's gonna suck? I mean come on."
ySy8mcceTno,"lender man
Slender man 2
Slender man 3
The amazing slender man
The amazing slender man 2 
Slender man homecoming"
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't even follow the original storyline?
ySy8mcceTno,For a second I thought this was fake
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the suit
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, once again showing that they have absolutely no idea how to make a movie using a pre-existing intellectual property. You guys have got to be kidding me. Just stop, already."
ySy8mcceTno,"They thought we couldn't make it worse they thought nothing was worse or as outdated and late than the emoji movie 





They were wrong

                               -sony pictures"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks disturbingly good
ySy8mcceTno,*W H A T   I N   T H E   F U C K*
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es estupido como si los que han echo emoji the movie van a sacar la película de la creepypasta de 2014 la van a arruinar
ySy8mcceTno,No way........ IM DEFINITLEY SEEING THIS!
ySy8mcceTno,ugh a sony movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this really life?
ySy8mcceTno,O.O I didn't know that O.O Also slenderman is the creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,The Slenderman trailer is confusing to me
ySy8mcceTno,Huh.Neat.
ySy8mcceTno,*WHERE THE FREAK IS SLENDY?!*
ySy8mcceTno,Woah starnger things 3 sure looks good!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, the company that produced the emoji movie. Now has the rights to Slenderman. Let that sink in."
ySy8mcceTno,Yes Finnaly Thank You
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: So why are you making this movie?

Sony: I like money"
ySy8mcceTno,oh c'mon people my boss isn't scary
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie just capitalizes and is self evident,I mean will this be bigger than isil?"
ySy8mcceTno,does slenderman wearing black suit or no?😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,6 years after the video game
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabron y te mató
ySy8mcceTno,It's gonna be like ghostbusters to me people hate it I watch it I fall in love
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this remind me of Friday The 13th
ySy8mcceTno,From the makers of The Emoji Movie... The Dead Meme Movie!
ySy8mcceTno,this looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know, yet"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony... 

First it was The Emoji Movie...

and now this atrocity.....

Why??? Just why??"
ySy8mcceTno,Well this just.....looks awful 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Alien covenant has heavily bodies
ySy8mcceTno,"This is my generations ,zodiac killer"
ySy8mcceTno,Congratulations Sony you have in fact seen The Ring I'm glad you liked it this much
ySy8mcceTno,Is this actually legit ?
ySy8mcceTno,I like pointy things - the weekenders
ySy8mcceTno,"Technically ,salad fingers was part of the initial idea"
ySy8mcceTno,WHY SOMY WHY
ySy8mcceTno,Then Logan Paul shows up and fucks everything up
ySy8mcceTno,would love to watch it but brah looks scary
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Eu esperava bem mais do trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Flop is real
ySy8mcceTno,"another CASHGRAB... after this, Jeff the Killer."
ySy8mcceTno,Aaaahhhhh mais eu vou assistir isso !!
ySy8mcceTno,STRIKING WHILE THE IRON IS ICE COLD
ySy8mcceTno,Omg that kid killing himself
ySy8mcceTno,Almost as relevant as the 2020 movie five nights at Freddy's
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,"His true name is Johnny. 
He is the paper boy from, ""Better Off Dead."" 
He is still seeking his 2 dollars and it has over 30 years of interest. :)"
ySy8mcceTno,"So slender man is gonne be a movie but no one has yet made a naruto real life movie. I kinda mad but happy. This better not be a ""L"". Cause this money/investment could have been spent on a goodass naruto movie. Many disagreee but thats okay cause naruto isisnt the best. Its just that i really wanna see a naruto movie."
ySy8mcceTno,I can feel the mythos being destroyed by Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Geez. No video game movies are good. People really just need to realize that this will be just like the rest. Seriously. This will be absolutely garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is really going to screw themselves over with this one
ySy8mcceTno,My worst nightmare is on tv
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer looks so bad.
ySy8mcceTno,So excited to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,What year is it?
ySy8mcceTno,It alright. It not great...it tasteless and lukewarm. It remind me of me beer which I like better but it alright.
ySy8mcceTno,Are they really trying to bring back the trend
ySy8mcceTno,You'd think after the stabbings that they wouldn't try to encourage it more but... here we are.
ySy8mcceTno,What are these retarded stock electric sound effects?
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,"I finish watching/catching up with Marble Hornets, Tribe Twelve and EverymanHYBRID, watch the Night Mind videos on them, and then this trailer drops within the week... that’s actually the spoopiest coincidence"
ySy8mcceTno,ждём в России этот фильм
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is everyone WANTING them to show him a lot? I thought we finally realized that too much exposure to it desensitizes the audience to it. Like in the new version of IT.  The clown was unsettling the first couple times, but we see it so much, it stops being scary. They really need to just nail the uncanny valley feel and play it almost like an HP Lovecraft project. Let your mind make the horrors, but put forth all the pieces to get there."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so done! It's like they are begging us to call this a cash grab movie. I bet those 9 year olds are wet from seeing this.
ySy8mcceTno,The flashing of unrelated disturbing imagery in black and white is a lot like The Ring tbh
ySy8mcceTno,"Coming soon: *Slender Man II - The Slendering*. A crossover with Jane the Killer, Candle Cove, Ben Drowned...and Teh Day Of All Teh Blood.

Spoiler: Slendy gets a girlfriend - MIss 173."
ySy8mcceTno,This will be like a DC movie. Really bad but because of its cultural relevance it’ll still do good at the box office
ySy8mcceTno,"me caga que todas las putas peliculas de terror son muy al estilo hollywood , esta mierda se nota que no tiene nada que ver con el creepypasta, algo así como la version de netflix de death note.

no me llama la atención verla la verdad jsjsjsjsjs."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh cool a Slenderman movie! In 2018? Why now though?
ySy8mcceTno,imma watch and judge this
ySy8mcceTno,"Reminds me of when I used to play that darn game, walking around in the forest with a flashlight for so long and finding nothing for so long I'd start getting sleepy"
ySy8mcceTno,Hope it comes out before January 28th!
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see it!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"You're a little late to be cashing in on the whole Slenderman craze, don't you think?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear god people are so numb to horror movies these days. If ya to thick to understand the horror genre then don’t even say anything, you just ruin it for everyone else"
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope they do a Jeff The Killer movie next. That would be awesome:)
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is markipliers' fault.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony what u doin
ySy8mcceTno,0:59 she just realized they made a slenderman movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This is terrifiying...............
ySy8mcceTno,looks boring to me
ySy8mcceTno,"So I'm going to go see this movie if I see anything I don't like or think isn't correct I'm going to burn down some houses
(I think it should be done if it's not correct)"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is too late for a creepypasta/game that came out way back in 2012, but the question is... *is it going to be worth it?*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Everyone in the comments is like ""YOU'RE 6 YEARS LATE SONY"" like does it really matter? Stop bitching about the littlest things jesus christ,, sure there'll probably have been more hype back in 2014 but theres no use complaining about something you have zero control over"
ySy8mcceTno,is this still a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,*Oh my FRICKIN GOD*
ySy8mcceTno,"That moment when no one seems to understand the history of the Slenderman and the creepypasta's made about it. Every comment seems to be ""wow such garbage not based off the game"". The game was simply a by product of the Slenderman mythos, it wasn't the creation of him. Also who cares if it's Sony? The company doesn't make the film, but the writers, actors, director, etc do. All Sony really does is supply the money."
ySy8mcceTno,is this a new horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,I just hope the ending won't be people killing people cliche
ySy8mcceTno,Convienet right when the Waukesha Wisconsin teens are getting sentenced? 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Who else kinda thought it was a cheesy trailer
ySy8mcceTno,What is slenderman gender?
ySy8mcceTno,The feeling that this gave me was more 'meh' than anything.
ySy8mcceTno,Spookiey asf
ySy8mcceTno,God this movie's gonna suck hella bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why not make a film about the Harlem Shake? In all honesty, please stop making films about old and outdated fads. That'd be like making a film about fidget spinners. BTW, didn't Slenderman's fame die out in like 2013?"
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next? Jeff the Killer movie? Oh god, I'm giving them ideas..."
ySy8mcceTno,This slender man looks kind of fat.
ySy8mcceTno,This is what is killing horror
ySy8mcceTno,You have now entered slenderland
ySy8mcceTno,Bish wha
ySy8mcceTno,I literally laughed while watching this
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,He's real he killed my dog during a tour around the woods I shaw him he had no face he whas tall and  he had big long tentecles he did not hurt me becuse he told me im a nice kid  and didn't deserved to die. That's  my. Worst thing that happened to me. If you see him don't be afraid.!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Too bad they have to CGI something as simple as Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Stop with all the hate it's still going to be a decent movie besides I takes lake four years to make a film and the slender man trend started in 2012 so stop with all the hate
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,"I think SLENDER MAN is more like the one who shows at Skrillex music video: ""FIRST OF THE YEAR"""
ySy8mcceTno,Where's slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry but SlenderMan was a thing 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,um... yes.... 😃
ySy8mcceTno,NO WAY
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like a great movie.

Now I’m just waiting for the dumb parents to complain about this bring the next slender murder."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is relevant again?
ySy8mcceTno,S:39 ENDER MAN
ySy8mcceTno,"God I can’t wait for 2013, this’ll be the highlight of that year"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, this looks bad, slender man is something that could be cool, but from the looks of it, he will get 1:24 second of screen time and the rest will be random events to try to build suspense but it wont"
ySy8mcceTno,nah
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see this
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like one of thoes shitty fan made trailers where it's just clips from other horror movies or ""scary"" stock footage mashed together. 
Knowing what Sony's last big named adaptation was, I'm not excited for this."
ySy8mcceTno,I waited all of 2016 and 2017 for this and I finally came
ySy8mcceTno,"Never seen so many dislikes on a trailer . Never played the game nor know about the character , so I may give that e movie a chance . Maybe . Sony isn’t know for great horror movies . I wish they would have went to Dimension Films or Warner Bros . Does look dark and promising . The cast ... ughhh that’s questionable . The plot... 
 Maybe entertaining"
ySy8mcceTno,"My friend was supposed to be in this movie, he was gonna play as the professor in the classroom"
ySy8mcceTno,ITS ABOUT TIME.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG this too funny..finally a movie for us tall skinny guys #beware lmfaoooo
ySy8mcceTno,"Just keep working on the new Spider-Man movie, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,The only problem is..........they made his face black not white wow #kindamyslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,*WHY*
ySy8mcceTno,YAAAAASSSS! I’VE WAITED SO! LONG!
ySy8mcceTno,*_Logan Paul has joined the game_*
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like I'm one of the very few people who's actually interested on how they're gonna handle this and how it's gonna play out because I was expecting it to be way, waaay fokn worse than this."
ySy8mcceTno,Why the fuckdid  you wait 5 years to make this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Omg! Im gonna see this the day it comes out...if it does:)
ySy8mcceTno,6 years... A little late huh?
ySy8mcceTno,I think it's been a very slow work day in Hollywood.
ySy8mcceTno,"How much of a cut of this movie will that guy from the Something Awful forums get as the creator's fee? Judging by the high quality of this trailer, he should definitely get at least 10% of the $1300 this movie grosses at the box office."
ySy8mcceTno,That looked stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,Tribetwelve probs did it better by a tenfold
ySy8mcceTno,Where is he??!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Comon’ the dude just wants his 20 bucks back.
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry to tell you but you're like 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"The new Ring movie looks good. Oh wait...

(Also love that studio lighting as they run in the woods at night)."
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG
ySy8mcceTno,"Also , Sony makes terrible movies"
ySy8mcceTno,Red Letter Media brought me here....
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man: *WHY ARE YOU RUNNING!? WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?*
ySy8mcceTno,"When this movie is released , millions of cringy creepypasta fans will surround the streets"
ySy8mcceTno,Are you kidding me !! This is a joke right ?! Well I better go watch some WWE to cheer me up.
ySy8mcceTno,Nooo..DIS CANT BE REAL.....DIS MUST BE FAKE.....I JUST OVER THE SLENDER MAN PHASE.......this looks really friggin good tho Ima watch it when it comes out!
ySy8mcceTno,"sure, let's pretend like marble hornets doesn't already have hours of content based around this."
ySy8mcceTno,Finalllyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t a couple of kids try to sacrifice someone to slender man you’d think they would stop after that..
ySy8mcceTno,It would be good if this is like a rolling where's wally of slenderman throughout the whole movie.
ySy8mcceTno,🖕🏽nope🖕🏽
ySy8mcceTno,Dumbest trailer I’ve ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,LOL. . . .
ySy8mcceTno,Kgala kbron y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"It's easy to beat him in the movie...just get 7 keys..,"
ySy8mcceTno,you should have left slender man in 2013
ySy8mcceTno,This year's generic PG-13 horror cash grab.
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know whether to be excited or mad.
ySy8mcceTno,#CANSONYDOIT #STOPIT #DONTMESSUPSLENDER
ySy8mcceTno,Here's to hoping yet another franchise is *not* going to be in shambles because of the cinematic industry...
ySy8mcceTno,#5YearsLate
ySy8mcceTno,You are way too late Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,it's not because they are going to do a slenderman movie that there going to talk about what's happening on Wisconsin they are just gonna make a scary movie with another story
ySy8mcceTno,"Sooooooo late, and we finnaly get a slender man movie and it's made by sony😐😐😑 it might not even be worth the wait but I'll watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,5 years late sony.
ySy8mcceTno,for the longest FUCKING TIME I waited for a slender man movie I gave up hope on it boom 2 years later slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,This would've been a super hyped trailer if you did thins back in 2012. Now slender man is a long dead meme. The whole creepy pastas itself are dead.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man, slender man, doing whatever a slender can."
ySy8mcceTno,This actually kinda gave me Anxiety
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t know if it’s just because it’s 6 am and i haven’t slept at all, but this is actually kinda scary?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ehhh, while Slendy is a pretty dead meme this still does kinda look interesting as a stand alone psychological horror flick"
ySy8mcceTno,Well now were are going to see creepypastas in the big screen. That's when you know you ran out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know how to feel about this trailer...love the video game and story but this looks so bad. I just hope the movie is good.
ySy8mcceTno,walk into the theater like ima watch slender man have an hour later leaving the theater like I saw slender man once the that fucking film yet the god dam movie is called SLENDER MAN not gonna lie I'm ill still most likely still see it.
ySy8mcceTno,When will the twitch head disappear.....
ySy8mcceTno,Luv how we don’t actually get to see how slender man looks in the trailer 👏🏽 bravo
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you better not fails us again like you did in 2017
ySy8mcceTno,Quit hating people its just a trailer it may be just need time to workon it a bit...
ySy8mcceTno,why was this not on my recommended sooner
ySy8mcceTno,Sony pls make an SCP universe.
ySy8mcceTno,He’s a skinny legend
ySy8mcceTno,"0:25 ""People don't just disappear"" 
Well look who's living in the IT world"

ySy8mcceTno,Bruh wheres da slender dude
ySy8mcceTno,Siii el pelado cabeza de huevooo
ySy8mcceTno,"Pensé que iba ser más épica pero me equivoqué solo es basura igual como la película de emojis 
1. Apenas aparece Slenderman
2. Pensé que iba ser como el juego pero me equivoqué"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY MY DREAM MOVI CAME
ySy8mcceTno,Next there's gonna be a Five Nights At Freddy's movie
ySy8mcceTno,No mames
ySy8mcceTno,"Somehow I get a feeling this movie is so rubbish that the ending is shown somewhere in this trailer, since there are not enough good scenes to harvest."
ySy8mcceTno,I have... no words.
ySy8mcceTno,A movie based on a creepypasta? oh lord no
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh this is gonna be a load of GARBAGE
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sure all the 13 year old creepypasta fans will be all over this.
ySy8mcceTno,All I can ask is just... Sony why?
ySy8mcceTno,pleasee don’t mess up. PLEASE
ySy8mcceTno,Lol when you think how this craze all started it's amazing how far and cancerous it's gotten but still kinda cool but this movie looks pretty bad tho...;-;
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real
ySy8mcceTno,I guess every creepy pasta must have a move I guess?
ySy8mcceTno,How to tell they ran out ideas
ySy8mcceTno,A Dross le gusta esto!
ySy8mcceTno,begins to contemplate drinking bleach....
ySy8mcceTno,"This didn't even seem like a movie about slender man, like I know there's not a ton of information on him because he's just a creepy pasta but this just felt like something completely different from slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,wtf are those people doing there? What were they’re plans? To have a fun time in the woods?
ySy8mcceTno,Great trailer only one complaint. Where's Slenderman ?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man said if he hits 10mil subs he'll do a face reveal
ySy8mcceTno,Sony produced it. Because of course they did.
ySy8mcceTno,"A made up story from the internet about no faced guy...
Yeah lets make a movie out of that."
ySy8mcceTno,"Oml, everybody hates this....XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow i never thought their would be a movie
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was 2018. Not 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so gonna watch this.
ySy8mcceTno,When Sony failed to capitalise on a modern trend they try to capitalise on a five years dead trend
ySy8mcceTno,Nice now the theater gonna be filled with emo fucks who slits there wrist and worships fnaf.....great
ySy8mcceTno,Wut
ySy8mcceTno,"Cheap budget, looks lame. Totally going to take my kids."
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly what's up with all the hate? This looks pretty dope.
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t screw this up. Please don’t screw this up. Please don’t screw this up. Please don’t screw this up.
ySy8mcceTno,I've loved Slender Man for years. This is now going to possibly be my favorite movie of all time.
ySy8mcceTno,No much understand wtf hello me no comprender
ySy8mcceTno,I’m afraid you guys are a couple years late
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next jack the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh they should of made the movie back in like 2011
ySy8mcceTno,La cagas y te mató xdxd

ySy8mcceTno,God I hate block busters.
ySy8mcceTno,1 ano esperando saporra sai e finalmente
ySy8mcceTno,"First the emoji movie now this. Let's face it Sony, you've gone off the deep end."
ySy8mcceTno,A meme turned into a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy pasta movie are the new thing next there probably going to make a movie on Jeff the killer or the rake 😒
ySy8mcceTno,Tarde Sony tarde >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, it took a while for this guy to get adapted"
ySy8mcceTno,you should of prob made this sooner slender man is v so old
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear slender man 







You need some milk..😂"
ySy8mcceTno,Unpopular opinion but I'm actually excited for this and hoping that is going too be good unlike most Sony films.......
ySy8mcceTno,It's to late
ySy8mcceTno,Secretly he only wants a hug
ySy8mcceTno,I've never looked at my watch well watching a trailer
ySy8mcceTno,0:12 THICC
ySy8mcceTno,"Guy: People dont just disappear...
Me: Tell that to Stranger Things"
ySy8mcceTno,I bet this is just going to be another terrible horror  movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus, this looks quite bad."
ySy8mcceTno,"toooooooooooooo 
late :p"
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it would be cool if they start turning creepy pastas into movies. Jeff, Eyeless, Laughing jack, Russian sleep for a few. Although I’d rather have a show with them"
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like Sony just leaves a bad taste in peoples mouths (well deserved mind you) and this does seem a bit late. But hey I'm willing to give it a shot. This trailer makes me think of American Horror Story. And given how I found that series creepy (not really scary but loved the armosphere and whole setting) I loved it. The fact it gives me ideas of it I'd say is good. The idea of the Slenderman as the creature is a haunting shadow. You never truely see him but occasionally get glimpses. I like in things like this where you don't see the creature. Especially when it's omnipresent like Slenderman. I hope this movie goes good. I'm easily impressed so may enjoy but hey if you enjoy isn't it worth while?
ySy8mcceTno,You are years later movie. Years late
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell naw.....
ySy8mcceTno,Dis is so stupid wtf
ySy8mcceTno,I mean at least it isn't emoji movie 2
ySy8mcceTno,"The girl went to the suicide forest.
She got attack by slendy

Logan paul: oMg wE fOuNd A dEaD bOdY."
ySy8mcceTno,It... doesn't look like it follows much of the mythos already established by pop culture.
ySy8mcceTno,Esperando a se les ocurra la de Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Of course Sony pictures and their infinite wisdom decide to put out a Slenderman movie 6 years after Slenderman’s popularity peaked.
ySy8mcceTno,"i love you sony 







now make forza a ps game as well and we can talk about letting you move in with me"
ySy8mcceTno,gimme 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,There are a lot of idiots who think Slender Man is just based off of the game
ySy8mcceTno,Is it bad I'm actually interested to see how they did this?
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember my grandfather talking about Slender Man being a dank meme when he was a boy. At this rate the next Star Wars will have the fat ""star wars kid"" joining against kylo to market to the kids... yo..."
ySy8mcceTno,I think it looks good id watch it
ySy8mcceTno,Too late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"People: ""Sony should've made this movie back in 2011 when Slenderman's trending."" 
So basically like the Emojis being trendy right now but the movie was a complete failure"
ySy8mcceTno,I actually think this looks way better then always watching which in fact was a Slenderman movie. I am very excited to see this and hope it will be a great movie. It would be cool if they would throw in the proxies as well.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm still expecting a Five Nights at Freddy's movie.
ySy8mcceTno,ECTOMORPH
ySy8mcceTno,The movie is not even out yet and people are already hating it. Can anyone just give it a chance? This is the second slender man movie were getting
ySy8mcceTno,I'm at least mildly curious.
ySy8mcceTno,Interesting...
ySy8mcceTno,y si la cagan ?
ySy8mcceTno,What’s that it’s 2011 creeping back up on us
ySy8mcceTno,#você consegue me ver?
ySy8mcceTno,slaiderman
ySy8mcceTno,"i know y'all are saying this came out too late but as someone who has babysitting kids who can't sleep bc they live near the woods and are afraid of this guy, i think the movie is going to do just fine in scaring their intended audience ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ not to mention that a few years ago there was that big murder case involving slenderman so this may be losely adapted off that too"
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks great, despite what the haters (yes, haters ALREADY) are saying."
ySy8mcceTno,I’m interested
ySy8mcceTno,Sony again
ySy8mcceTno,"QUE MIERDA ACABO DE VER .-. 
Sony Pictures Entertainment q vaina es esta?"
ySy8mcceTno,i think it will be a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,i'm so ready to be disappointed :)
ySy8mcceTno,I wish it would had been SCP containment breach just because there's a lot more to work with and probably would be more creepy but then again it's sony
ySy8mcceTno,i'm still waiting for the F.N.A.F movie also slendy 6-10 years late sry buddy your done
ySy8mcceTno,"""What? Wait. What? What the hell? What? Huh? What? What the hell?"" was my reaction to seeing that this movie is going to be real.

Will this be the first good video game movie? No way to mess THIS up! Wait. No. I take that back..."

ySy8mcceTno,Turning an original and well known Internet legend into just another horror movie cliché .. did you expect anything else from Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Why does slenderman remind me of the Demogorgon?
ySy8mcceTno,looks neat
ySy8mcceTno,whats next SCP movie

Such as Star Wars The Last Jedi and more! But sometimes it’s probably the best movie or not! So, “Calm down, relax, take a sip of beer and shut your mouth!”"
ySy8mcceTno,Why?

ySy8mcceTno,That was terrible! I’m never coming back here.
ySy8mcceTno,😨😱
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I can’t wait!!!!! I love this creepypasta!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Like if you’re a proxy and can’t wait for the release
ySy8mcceTno,I don't understand how this has anything to do with Slenderman??? I was expecting something like the game idk what this is
ySy8mcceTno,"The perfect movie doesn't exi..

Oh."
ySy8mcceTno,ずっと待ってました。ありがとう
ySy8mcceTno,At the beginning why does it tell me to watch the trailer? Isn't that what I'm doing? I keep thinking each SONY movie will be it's last but they must be siphoning PlayStation's profits to support these embarrassments.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my godd😳
ySy8mcceTno,When does it come out?
ySy8mcceTno,I'm here for the Gay Elephant Noise @ 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,Remind me again why we need this.
ySy8mcceTno,"So when are we getting the ""Doge"" and ""Troll Dad"" movie, eh Sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow slender mans movie cool a creepy pasta movie first one too
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the annoying orange makes a cameo
ySy8mcceTno,The rings slenderman version
ySy8mcceTno,"Was anyone ever really scared of slenderman? Sony seeks the answer of this puzzling question in their new movie called ""5 years late""!"
ySy8mcceTno,And next is the Five Nights At Freddy’s movie.
ySy8mcceTno,IT TOOK THIS LONG JUST FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT *breathes in* BOIIIII
ySy8mcceTno,Puta c mamaron con el trailer a y por sierto alguien habla español

ySy8mcceTno,it’s like they’re trying to have another girl stabbed

ySy8mcceTno,"Ha...

































































































































































































































No"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,The girl at the end must be sally
ySy8mcceTno,it would've been better if it was a movie that was pretty much a video tape that was recorded and was viewed by the people.
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE :P
ySy8mcceTno,hope it turns out good! if not it's perfectly fine cause slendermans fake and weird anyways!
ySy8mcceTno,"She looks and acts like Kirsty, from the first Hellraiser."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks stupid and only serves as little kid’s fan-fiction movie. Watch Five Night at Freddy’s get a feature film....garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"Cágala cabrón, cágala y te mato.jpg"
ySy8mcceTno,"1. He’s not a psychological killer
2. He doesn’t make any noise
3. He’s not known to drive people to suicide
Youve created a new slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,When i was 12 i would be screaming
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna be a disappointment just like any film nowadays.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late dude shoulda made it way earlier and base it on the game or anything better than this cmon

ySy8mcceTno,SCP [REDACTED] has broken containment. Permission to authorize MTF-97 is in progress. Please wait for further instructions.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, this movie will be an Extreme Disaster."
ySy8mcceTno,"This is so terrible. It's just a jumble of horror movie cliches with the title Slender Man. They could really make an incredible movie with him, and I don't think it's to late. But this looks horrible. They're just gonna take a unique horror character and turn him into a lame, forgettable horror monster. Such a shame. I've been wanting a Slender Man game for so long. But this is gonna be trash."
ySy8mcceTno,Foda demais
ySy8mcceTno,You missed the mark by like 5 years wtf Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man, the demon that comes into your home during dinner and masturbates into your mashed potatoes."
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, a good movie from sony"
ySy8mcceTno,man this has potential
ySy8mcceTno,BADASS
ySy8mcceTno,like 10 years waiting for this
ySy8mcceTno,"on one hand, i'm ecstatic to see a slenderman movie. On the other- these are the people who gave us the emoji movie..."
ySy8mcceTno,That's tuff.
ySy8mcceTno,This just looks shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,What if slender man drinks me?
ySy8mcceTno,They didn’t even use his static sounds in this!
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this was some sorta parody or spoof trailer, then I saw the Sony logo and knew it was a joke."
ySy8mcceTno,NO THE PICTURE SPREADING SLENDER WAS RELEASED IN 2009 SO THIS IS WAY TO LATE
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this trailer for months because I knew they would make a movie about slender man in 2018
ySy8mcceTno,This would be best movie of the year if it were 2010 XD
ySy8mcceTno,"I wonder how many things this movie is going to try and make cannon.






-still probably going to prefer the mythos-"
ySy8mcceTno,ABOUT TIME
ySy8mcceTno,YES YES YES I NEED TO SEE THISSSSS I ALREADY KNOW ITS GOING TO BE AMAZING
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Send help pls.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why do poeple complain about this, and they are not ran out of ideas this is a perfect time to make a movie of slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,Wait...really?
ySy8mcceTno,Esto no es slendeman! :|
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,Of course this would happen
ySy8mcceTno,This is a Ring reskin. Pure trash smh.
ySy8mcceTno,Can you hear it?... The Drums...The Drums of no face... The Birth...Of The Bells...and the birth...of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"This is going to be a great film! Sure Sony Pictures might be low on ideas, but at least whatever they do make is at a professional level. I think many will enjoy this including me."
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this movie to come out for a long time.
ySy8mcceTno,I'll be whatching this
ySy8mcceTno,I wish this was a documentary about the stabbing.
ySy8mcceTno,Great job guys only about 7 years late 👏
ySy8mcceTno,"*WHERE IS POPEYE, SONY?*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony Pictures is the dumbest company ever. They ruined Spiderman. They made the Emoji Movie. Bunch of idiots fr. They're the reason  that the Sicario sequel says ""Sicario 2"" in the title and isn't just ""Soldado"""
ySy8mcceTno,someone call 2011 pewdiepie
ySy8mcceTno,White people have to make up boogeymen...Blacks and Latinos have the POLICE.
ySy8mcceTno,MY ANTENNAS ARE UP NOW WITH THESE TRAILERS BECAUSE INSIDIOUS 4 WAS A 3/10 ON THE 'SCARY-O-METER'
ySy8mcceTno,Now we need a “Jeff the Killer” movie
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like whoever made this movie just slapped the name “Slender Man” on it because they needed a way to distinguish their generic horror movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I honestly think this looks good, even though it reminds me of The Ring. But if Masky and Hoodie don't make an appearance somewhere I will be disappointed"
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this isn't the kind of film to not even let you get a close look at the Enemy/Monster.
OR the kind that only lets you see it about 2 times only.
You have to LOOK at the slender man to (die?)."
ySy8mcceTno,as long as sony recognises that Slenderman does not belong to them.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG i wanna see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,“Him”? How DARE you assume it’s gender!
ySy8mcceTno,didn't understand anything
ySy8mcceTno,Sa wea  k prro
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man
Slender man 2
Slender man 3
The amazing slender man
The amazing slender man 2 
Slender man homecoming
:v"
ySy8mcceTno,Well that was disappointing
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes, yes and YEESS"
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was a joke but Sony actually did it. Too late though
ySy8mcceTno,or The sad story of Slenderman I cried
ySy8mcceTno,if you watch I eat pasta for breakfast then it might make you think slender Man  has good in him
ySy8mcceTno,the game was better
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad. 🤣
ySy8mcceTno,This is not Spider-Man. Oml what did I click on
ySy8mcceTno,This looks nothing like the game
ySy8mcceTno,They need to do one of Jeff z killer
ySy8mcceTno,Umm okay Sony hahaha
ySy8mcceTno,Who else thinks this isn’t scary ??
ySy8mcceTno,All y’all need to stop complaining because you know dam well you’re ALL gunna see it when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,They could have made Penpal; directed by an Oscar winning director. But instead they go with a creepy pasta that is around 6 years old. Rest In Peace Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Everything wrong 1 it's late 2 didn't show that much in the trailer and 3 it looks like you don't see a lot of slender man this is just my opinion
ySy8mcceTno,People Stop! I want to see the movie... Don’t ruin it for me please (( I’m a huge slendy fan since marbelhornets))
ySy8mcceTno,This is stupid
ySy8mcceTno,NOT SCARY ENOUGH. I DID NOT HIDE IN THE COMMENT SECTION FOR THIS ONE. MAKE IT SCARIER!
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets kicks this movie very far
ySy8mcceTno,Still no venom trailer but this sony whyyyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,Dat zaddy from another planet 👅💦😝😝💘low-key when girls say they like tall guys lmao this what they mean
ySy8mcceTno,I bet you he's not even gonna make an appearance in the movie

ySy8mcceTno,Scare pewdiepie season 2 looks kinda shitty tbh
ySy8mcceTno,I tought this thing would never happen(im glad it does)  :_)
ySy8mcceTno,Oh look another flop for sony! YAY!
ySy8mcceTno,It's not 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"0:47
I don't remember something like that being in the original creepypasta... I don't remember him making people crazy... But at least you didn't change how he looks... Please let the pages be in this..."
ySy8mcceTno,If they are doing this I would like to see if they can also do the Russian sleep experiment.
ySy8mcceTno,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY to late
ySy8mcceTno,Im watchin it when it comes out ive been a fan of slender for 3 yrs
ySy8mcceTno,That was a bit underwhelming
ySy8mcceTno,I called it I KNEW A SLENDERMAN MOVIE WOULD EVENTUALLY COME OUT I FLIPPING CALLED IT
ySy8mcceTno,"By the people who brought you The Emoji Movie, comes an all new exciting thriller."
ySy8mcceTno,*+1 if you love Camila Cabeo*
ySy8mcceTno,Let's beat a dead horse. It'll be fun.
ySy8mcceTno,"Watch I'm pretty sure this movie is gonna talk about Slender and kids getting killed, but is barely gonna give Slender any screen time."
ySy8mcceTno,When’s I first heard there was going to be a movie I was soooo excited but now this is not how the lore goes. How it really goes is if you are victim of slender either he stalks you then kills you or gives you the slender sickness while you slowly go insane and become one of his proxies. This is gonna be the Percy Jackson movie of horror
ySy8mcceTno,FIRST THE  GAME NOW A MOVIE IT'S BASICALLY SLENDER MAN GAME THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSS
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks more based on the stabbings, not the source material"
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine if this movie was more of a home video style (kind of like Blair witch) with teens being pursued by slender man. This trailer makes it look like rings 🤦🏻‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,怖い！！
ySy8mcceTno,"can't wait for the after credits trailer, five nights at Freddy's: coming 2025...."
ySy8mcceTno,"At first I thought it would go for the more cliché one camera found footage route that I feel they had used to death, but after seeing this trailer I am somewhat more intrigued to see how this will all play out because it doesn't look that bad and they kinda keep the whole mythos,  lore and character of the Slender man very mysterious and intriguing. I find it interesting that they are keeping him as a looming sinister prescene that blends into the shadows (which is what the character is always known for and what made his character all that more creepier) and they seem to be keeping his lore accurate (about how he would cause people he crosses to go insane and become paranoid and crazy)"
ySy8mcceTno,bad
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, Sony, Sony...
You may have gotten the popular 3rd graders to respect you, but I highly doubt that you can get us emos on your side."
ySy8mcceTno,Delet this
ySy8mcceTno,Wow! child psychological horror and possession! Never saw that type of horror genre before.... !
ySy8mcceTno,"Why did they make Slender Man less interesting? If this didn't have the name attached, it wouldn't be on Trending."
ySy8mcceTno,where is the suit tough ....
ySy8mcceTno,"That’s nice in all, but I’m still waiting for the FNAF movie, since FNAF is still relevant. Slender Man is kinda old now."
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder what 1080p Quality of SlenderMan would look like
ySy8mcceTno,Ok I have extremely mixed feelings because first it's like finally! I don't see why people haven't done this or a Jeff the killer movie yet. And then I see it's sony the people who royally messed up the fantastic 4 movie. And I'm afraid this is going to be so terrible that everyone is going to be afraid to pick it up again
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Looks badass
ySy8mcceTno,Better as a game. That acting is average.
ySy8mcceTno,looks dumb with little girls -.- use the old story for it not the fing little princess
ySy8mcceTno,All I can hope is that they know the story of slender and that they get it right instead of making another crappy ghost movie
ySy8mcceTno,No lo c Rick parece falso
ySy8mcceTno,"Man, Sony gets picked on way too much it's sad."
ySy8mcceTno,Low key reminds me of the ring
ySy8mcceTno,Not clichéd.... Not clichéd at all.
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks horrible, you're making slenderman seem more like a schizophrenic hallucination, a psychological horror instead of a very real monster."
ySy8mcceTno,man this looks stupid as hell. this is gonna be some ghost adventures level of awful
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?!?!? 2018 right?!
ySy8mcceTno,Mate was that not the whole film in the trailer? I'm definitely seeing it for those stupid creepypasta vibes I loved as a kid but
ySy8mcceTno,Bueno es decepcionante el trailer ... Solo espero que la película no tenga el mismo efecto
ySy8mcceTno,Tell me why I KNOW its going to be like Area 51 where they showed the actual aliens ONCE for like a couple seconds.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man slender man all the children try to run
Slender man slender man to him it’s just part of the fun"
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn't relate in any way to slenderman. You could have just named it ""Fuccboi"" and it would have been a better name to be honest, as nothing would've changed."
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is what? 7 to 10 years too late? Nice timing Sony, you sure gonna make your money back..."
ySy8mcceTno,I really want to see this but I have a feeling I won't want to leave the house for 3 months
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the pedo bear movie coming in 261 week's
ySy8mcceTno,Only 8 years late
ySy8mcceTno,epic
ySy8mcceTno,well... i guess it could be worse
ySy8mcceTno,2012 we meet again...
ySy8mcceTno,"They where running out of ideas for a horror movie, so they went back in time. But I think 5/6 years is a bit to long"
ySy8mcceTno,So does anyone else think someone going stab a friend in the forest because of this
ySy8mcceTno,#notmyslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,"WHY DO YOU MAKE SLENDERMAN MOVIES ON 2018

ySy8mcceTno,gay
ySy8mcceTno,Y jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Glad everyone seems to be getting how terrible and inaccurate this shits gonna be
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I can't wait for this looks awesome
ySy8mcceTno,Your a few years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"If Logan Paul meets Slenderman, he would film him instead of running away"
ySy8mcceTno,"If this film just a kind of beast which kill everyone without any meaning , i wont watch"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dumb, dumb, dumb."
ySy8mcceTno,Would it be bad if i wanted people to make a jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Omg yessssss
ySy8mcceTno,HAHA
ySy8mcceTno,this is a joke right?
ySy8mcceTno,Welp
ySy8mcceTno,What's next squid wards suicide?
ySy8mcceTno,They should have had YouTubers like Markiplier and PewDiePie play the main characters. Seeing that they pretty much popularized Slenden man with their videos. It would've gave the movie more hype...
ySy8mcceTno,*#35 on Trending*
ySy8mcceTno,I think they forgot to research about slenderman 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Oh great! Sony have run out of ideas again.
ySy8mcceTno,why is this a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,next horror movies is gonna be dimonetized
ySy8mcceTno,long overdue
ySy8mcceTno,"Uhhhhh
 lil late"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no....
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Jeff the killer will be a movie to
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is based off that case where the young girls stabbed someone to please slenderman recently Lol.  Not about the game or anything.
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,From the same company that brought you the Emoji movie... Slender Man!
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is hyped for this movie spam like if u are👍🏼🔥💯😜

Me 18 years old after finding out that Derv and Minecraft lets players are a thing. {plays twenty different Kazoos at once just to summon him in our darkest hour}"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, Sony. Will you ever learn?"
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Good... This seems ok... I'll give it a try.
ySy8mcceTno,Ooooooo  cool 😎
ySy8mcceTno,I was waiting for this like 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,Dang this looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,Im SO Excited!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like stranger things demastered
ySy8mcceTno,Y de repente un comentario en español
ySy8mcceTno,I think it's a great idea for a horror flick even if the slender craze died in 2012 and it looks pretty scary
ySy8mcceTno,Better not be kids stabbings people
ySy8mcceTno,From creepypasta to official film. Can't wait to see an SCP movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Gayyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,1:28 joey king!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there's some people in the movie that become Proxies. that would be so cool!
ySy8mcceTno,"Here comes the ""they should make a jeff the killer movie next"" fans"
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this trailer about? It seems like just another scary (not really) studio movie. Doesn't encompass the aura of the creepy pasta at all.
ySy8mcceTno,But... Marble Hornets already made a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This could be good.
ySy8mcceTno,"This could have been an amazing movie, but they totally blew it"
ySy8mcceTno,YouTube trending videos have some of the stupidest comments.
ySy8mcceTno,"Just like the venom trailer, the very thing the movie is named after is hardly in the trailer at all"
ySy8mcceTno,"I just wanna see him grow into that insane tree size, and the tentacles. Also the creepy Smile with the teeth. I have no judgment on trailer.  I go in this movie not having high or low hopes just really  hope  they did a fair enough job."
ySy8mcceTno,"Calling it now, as one of the biggest slenderman fans out there,this movies is gonna be garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,AW HELL YEAH!!!
ySy8mcceTno,A movie YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I love the creepypasta itself but a MOVIE!!! You guys are running out of ideas Once again. First, the  emoji movie now this! Slenderman is becoming boring and sad. I'm happy for this but you sony is running out of ideas"
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus. This gonna be terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,0:25 ‘People don’t just disappear’ Tell that to Madeleine McCann
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a fan made film it doesn't even look like a real production movie. Other than that I hope the movie turns out good but the trailer just isn't scary
ySy8mcceTno,Meh..They took too long to make this
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya es tarde...








5 años tarde >:v"
ySy8mcceTno,At this point its not slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing left for Sony to do is do a remake of the Room.
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this movie is gonna suck cus of Sony :/
ySy8mcceTno,Looks kinda wack..
ySy8mcceTno,"I actually have chronic paranoia due to Slender Man, I am extremely terrified of him . Even watching the trailer was like something I was super hesitant about and I literally had my phone tilted the entire time and the volume down . But I'm actually pretty disappointed . The thing that makes Slender Man so scary for me is the concept that he stalks you, and you can't get away from him . I see no creepy stalking here, it looks as if he kidnaps his victims . And it also looks as if there's going to be several victims within a community, like a chain of children go missing or go crazy, which is just stupid . It would've been much better if the focal point was only on one person and no one else was experiencing the same things she was, making it all the more realistic and she could be categorized as insane . Which is the whole thing, most of his victims were believed to be insane, no one believed them . I don't know, it just seems lame to me ."
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who thought this was funny instead of scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman ruined by Hollywood coming soon
ySy8mcceTno,I find it the trailer creepy will the movie be good idk
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like a generic horror movie. You could've replaced Slenderman with any other horror movie monster/creature, and it would've made almost no difference."
ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap it’s the real deal this time.
ySy8mcceTno,"Because this is Sony, I'm gonna assume they'll force a bunch more sequels and remakes down our throats for the next few years of this property before Disney acquires it and somehow makes a better version."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I am so hype for this movie to come out
ySy8mcceTno,They gotta find the eight pages to win so.........
ySy8mcceTno,Just wait in 7 years down the line after SCP has had it's many runs of games and machinimas Sony will somehow buy all the rights and slap together a similar mess
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was fake but okaey
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"Why so many dislikes? If Sony makes a has a chance to make a genuinely good psychological horror movie based on a trend from years ago, I'm fuckin taking it. They have a chance to make something amazingly creative, because Slender Man has little to none canon mythos. This is not a bad idea in the slightest."
ySy8mcceTno,*like si ven esto :D*
ySy8mcceTno,fix this sony
ySy8mcceTno,Really...Slenderman?Unbelievable. Un fucking believable 😐
ySy8mcceTno,There's a reason why the show Channel Zero didn't start out with one of the most popular creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,i thought we left this in 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Teens Stabbing there friends won't be the only thing happening
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man back at it again after YEARS •_•
ySy8mcceTno,There's already a Slenderman movie (Marble Hornets) and this doesn't look like it can even slightly compare.
ySy8mcceTno,WELL IM NEVER GOING OUTSIDE AGAIN. HELLLLLLL TOOOOO THEEEEEE NOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,"""People don't just disappear"" 
Hmmmmm...... *THAT IS NOT CORRECT*"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow bro so scary
ySy8mcceTno,"You wrote wrong ""Slenderman""

Lol💩"
ySy8mcceTno,K.
ySy8mcceTno,omg is amazing... for the end  one  picture of slenderman  no bad <3
ySy8mcceTno,This would be a greta idea for another horror movie but why did you have to put slender man in it
ySy8mcceTno,Sony really enjoys turning obnoxious pop culture everyone is sick of into movies no one wants
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Literally no one wants this
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony maybe think this over a little longer bub. Release it in 20130. here's your rocket ship of writing potential 
8=============D~~~~~~~~ blast off dog"
ySy8mcceTno,WELL OKAY A SLENDERMAN MOVIE WHO SAW THAT COMING
ySy8mcceTno,But why tho
ySy8mcceTno,1:55 ... Scp-096 screams?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should come out when all the big youtuber play the slender man game
ySy8mcceTno,Tresh
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer felt about 6 mins long can't wait to see how long the movie feels
ySy8mcceTno,The man just wants his $20.
ySy8mcceTno,It's to laaaaaaaaaaatttttteeeeeeeee
ySy8mcceTno,"There had better be camera static in the movie, at least once. And, I hope some of the writers for Marble Hornets write for the movie as well."
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie is gonna be a disappointment. Too bad :(
ySy8mcceTno,Sony tries to kill another property.  Good luck!
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully slender man is somewhere in the background of each scene
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao a few years too late  🙄
ySy8mcceTno,"At 1:57 it sounds like the spaget guy, maybe this movie is an elaborate meme"
ySy8mcceTno,Too many years late
ySy8mcceTno,"Will this be a good horror movie with story, or just another crap horror movie with the usual shock scenes?"
ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap this looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey remember when that guy from SomethingAwful stole his ""ideas' from /x/ and passed them off as his own?"
ySy8mcceTno,1:33 we3n u spl0oge but it the rong kind of spl0ge
ySy8mcceTno,"Dont be so critical guys, the trailer looks fairly good"
ySy8mcceTno,Very confusing trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"You cant be serious
*sees that its by sony*
Oh god"
ySy8mcceTno,Hm🤔
ySy8mcceTno,marble hornets did it first you're a good 9 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like its trying to be the ring. take a bunch of imagery and slap slenderman on it
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna watch when out
ySy8mcceTno,When Sony finally makes a movie about an outdated thing from 5years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Yay
ySy8mcceTno,Is this movie based on the creepy pasta or based around the story of the girl who killed the other girl to try and summon slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"The whole thing with Slendermen is he makes people insane and kill people for him. He doesn't really ""stalk"" them and kill them. They should try to do more research before ruining it."
ySy8mcceTno,"Introducing Sony Pictures Entertainment , making ""Why does this exists?"" movies since 'The Emoji Movie'"
ySy8mcceTno,guys stop complaining you know like nothing about the movie so far just because it's a modern horror movie doesn't mean it's going to be bad -.-
ySy8mcceTno,Really?
ySy8mcceTno,That looks pretty good
ySy8mcceTno,always some creepy girls in these movies
ySy8mcceTno,Will Gene the meh emoji guest star in this?
ySy8mcceTno,about time
ySy8mcceTno,I have a sneaking suspicion that this movie won't do to well
ySy8mcceTno,9th grade me in 2012 is thriving right now
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be bad is it
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this isn’t trash
ySy8mcceTno,wasted money LUL
ySy8mcceTno,THIS LOOKS TERRIBLE AND AMAZING AT THE SAME TIME
ySy8mcceTno,"#CanYouSeeHim when I'm high,yes"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALY A MOVIE ABOUT SLENDER MAN I BET PEWDIEPIE WILL PRE ORDER THIS ON DVD INFINITY AMOUNT OF TIMES
ySy8mcceTno,That jump scare with the chick behind the tree has the best jump scare of all time. Cough Cough sarcasm.
ySy8mcceTno,Next: Jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Probably not going to be any good, still gonna watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,it'd be more interesting if it were based off the game instead of the stabbing
ySy8mcceTno,ahh this made my ball hairs stick up
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry but i remember me and my friends used to be obsessed with slender in like 1st grade lol we actually thought we saw him. I mean we didn’t stab each other xD but that brings back memories and this movie looks like trash and about that stabbing thing, it’s awful your making a movie based on girls who stabbed each other to “appease” slender man!! And plus like i said it looks like garbage and these kind of movies are terrible. I was a fan of him back in 2011 and this nothing like him!! F*cking sh*t!"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY OMG
ySy8mcceTno,WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG???
ySy8mcceTno,Just stop. No one wanted this. No one needed this.
ySy8mcceTno,I hate trailer no have the history of slenderman is a fail jajajajajajajajajajajjajajajaja
ySy8mcceTno,sony your about 4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,A fucking marker doesn’t make that scribble sound
ySy8mcceTno,Does he even have his suit
ySy8mcceTno,Must watch
ySy8mcceTno,Yo tengo una película
ySy8mcceTno,This movie actually looks pretty bad honestly it isng going to do good in theatres and the box office
ySy8mcceTno,Suleymander 😃😄statik
ySy8mcceTno,Haha it looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,"Happy wheels
Flappy bird
Tap tap revenge

ySy8mcceTno,Omg finally!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,tanto tiempo esperando la pelicula al FIN!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Did i travel to the past??
ySy8mcceTno,aRe yOu sERiOus
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks for making this an unskippable ad. This film is obviously gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,"Im telling you all now, this movie is gonna be garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,"Death is upon me








And I’ll gladly go to it"
ySy8mcceTno,Italiani?
ySy8mcceTno,"I saw it coming, but I didn't."
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years late to the punch, Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"Well I enjoyed play the eight pages and the arrival but I don't think that the movie will be great as 1. Slender Man is knows to stalk people and drive the insane!! 
2. It is not what games or creppypasta do
3. I does not include maggots and some sorts of it. 
Well I. Still going to watch the movie and I hope that the movies is good as arrival and not crap like this trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
ySy8mcceTno,Considering they got the atmosphere wrong. Looks like another cash grab January film tbh...
ySy8mcceTno,Well then
ySy8mcceTno,This is just a bad idea
ySy8mcceTno,Seems legit.
ySy8mcceTno,Capitalizing on nostalgia but nobody has given one in like five years okay Sony get laid.
ySy8mcceTno,"Isn’t it a bit late to make a slender cash gra- I mean movie? And of course it’s Sony’s fault. Please Sony, stop making movies, you’re ruining the art of film."
ySy8mcceTno,"I dont get why it is so hard to make a good video game movie, or video game horror movie..."
ySy8mcceTno,Br?
ySy8mcceTno,Really what's next jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,My boy Adam Rosner better make a cameo in this
ySy8mcceTno,This acually looks terrifying
ySy8mcceTno,Yesssss finally!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Not gonna lie. This looks like a bad movie FOR the Slender Man Name. But if it had any other title, it wouldn’t have been bad."
ySy8mcceTno,1:43 It is on her right the whole time...
ySy8mcceTno,Ok no
ySy8mcceTno,Oh lordy. I can already see the 30-40% at Rotten Tomatoes. Well I guess it had to happen eventually.
ySy8mcceTno,"IT FINALLY CAAAAAAME!!
dang this trailer was scar-ry"
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the sequel featuring Jeff the fucking Killer
ySy8mcceTno,"Now just give us the ""Pong"" movie, and we'll be cooking with gas!"
ySy8mcceTno,ITZ OFFICIAL!!!! Now I'am excited!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, another fail for Sony Pictures!"
ySy8mcceTno,"YAWN, 100 MOVIES LIKE THIS ON NETFLIX, SAVE YA MONEY..."
ySy8mcceTno,Mam anissa weier and morgan geyser would be excited
ySy8mcceTno,Nioce
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe it took them somewhere around nine years to announce a slender man movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Now you have to make a Jeff the Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Isso era um jogo...Isso era um jogo.
ySy8mcceTno,This movies already sucks I ain’t seeing it
ySy8mcceTno,"They could at least put 
The Return of Slender Man 
It would be cooler"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a real slender man movie its about fucking time.☠🔪
ySy8mcceTno,The slender man wasn't even good to begin with
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah okay
ySy8mcceTno,What... Is this the stranger things season 3 trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,Guau no sabia que le iban a hacer película a slenderman  solo falta de jeff the killer a todos ellos
ySy8mcceTno,YO THIS HAS ME SO HYPE THESE GAMES WERE SO BIG FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,IS THIS A SLENDER MOIVE YAS
ySy8mcceTno,Gotta be a joke 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmm this actually looks pretty promising. Sony please for the love of god don't fail us now
ySy8mcceTno,"If they make an SCP movie and it has nothing to do with SCP like this trailer had nothing to do with Slender, ill Scream"
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how much the developers for the game got paid to let them make this.
ySy8mcceTno,niBBa wat
ySy8mcceTno,I played the game
ySy8mcceTno,Im just waiting for a Jeff The Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh my go- Really? They're actually making this a thing? Oh come on, even a FNAF movie would be better than this. I'm 100% calling that this movie is going to bomb."
ySy8mcceTno,"MY DEAR CREEPYPASTA FANS, UNITE!!!! OUR DREAMS ARE COMING TRUEEE!!!!! XD"
ySy8mcceTno,"Nooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooo
oooooooooooooooooo
ooooooooooooooooooo 
oooooooooooooooooo 
oooooooooooooooooo 
oooooooooooooooooo 
oooooooooooooooooo 
oooooooooooooooooo 
oooooooooooooooooo 
oooooooooooooooooo"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like a shitty sequel to a shitty movie. Please, dont let this be how the trailer portrays it to be. Please, dont add a bunch of useless horribly written story to it like Slender the Arrival did. Please, feature slender as the one and only antagonist. Please, dont make like the Jeff the Killer community, and ruin Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,From internet meme to a horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Tbh,idc how bad this is supposedly going to be.The fact that Creepypastas are now popular enough to be made into official movies is AWESOME!This is the first horror movie I'm willingly going to watch no matter how scared I'll get!"
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMAN no segundo 37? Lá trás
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like The Ring instead of Slender Man, lol. [At the beginning]


I've been a hardcore fan of Slender Man and seeing this might not be that great. It doesn't show his kind of ""symbol"" in the drawing scene. Once I watch this movie I probably might've seen another reboot of the ring. This seems very anti climatic. [This is in my opinion, but you may never know, it might turn out good.]"
ySy8mcceTno,Of course sony would do this
ySy8mcceTno,This looks great
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os brbrbrbrbrbb
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sorry sony but the Marble Hornet movie was better than this looks
ySy8mcceTno,"Stop it, get some help"
ySy8mcceTno,Where's Pewds? And this is nothing like Slenderman. :/
ySy8mcceTno,It shows everything except slender
ySy8mcceTno,lets hope this isnt crap
ySy8mcceTno,No one would be stupid enough to go there at night with no protection unless theirs a reason for it
ySy8mcceTno,"This isn't about the game...
The movie is based off The Slender Man stabbing."
ySy8mcceTno,2018. Slender man's trending again
ySy8mcceTno,on my opinion i like this trailer and i hope the movie os good too. i only have one question why is sony making a slenderman movie in 2018!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,You guys actually need the slenderman PAGE SYMBOLS WTF THATS WHAT MAKES IT SCARY
ySy8mcceTno,i remember playing every slenderman games with my friends in school.. we weould play the camera slender game and we would go everywhere trying to find the slenderman.. its not even what ur supposed to do
ySy8mcceTno,Feel like this is gonna be dumb not sure. But if it is I said it first
ySy8mcceTno,The internet’s most popular creepypasta now has his own movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is it going to be lore friendly tho
ySy8mcceTno,Lol tf
ySy8mcceTno,They just now make this😑
ySy8mcceTno,No me la creo la puta madre que me parió!
ySy8mcceTno,"HEY LET'S MAKE A MOVIE TO CAPITALIZE ON AN OLD INTERNET MEME, THAT'LL GO WELL RIGHT"
ySy8mcceTno,Next Movie : Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,Please be good please be good please be good
ySy8mcceTno,I loved this and all creepypastas hope they make more pasta movies
ySy8mcceTno,Süleymander o slenderman değil
ySy8mcceTno,looking forward to this!
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this dies and never returns.
ySy8mcceTno,One woomen finds skinny boi
ySy8mcceTno,Sp00Ky
ySy8mcceTno,"slender,i heard he has aids"
ySy8mcceTno,If fnaf dont  be relased please make it 🐻🐥🐺🐾
ySy8mcceTno,Sony COULDVE at least AT LEAST made it a found footage movie out of this.
ySy8mcceTno,One person In my school is a literal fan of slender man and I think he will freak out unless he already saw this video
ySy8mcceTno,*1:51** After this scene i know this is HIGH BUDGET film*
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like its going to be a ""nothing"" film. People will forget about it in 2 years from now."
ySy8mcceTno,...they are 5 years late. This is going to be trash.
ySy8mcceTno,thats not slender at all i know him..... why do you people think hes a bad guy his nice...????????
ySy8mcceTno,Looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,I see you got around intellectual property laws by making this the most generic thing possible
ySy8mcceTno,It came along way now it made its into a shitstrom
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,I swear Sony needs to stop making movies
ySy8mcceTno,"I used to be terrified of slenderman







I still kinda am lmao








Why am I watching this while I'm home alone lmao"
ySy8mcceTno,Boi
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice editing.








So fake"
ySy8mcceTno,This Movie will Be Epic
ySy8mcceTno,Ummm what is this?...take it back
ySy8mcceTno,This isnt kid friendly but I want to see it
ySy8mcceTno,"I was actually hyped for during the first 55 seconds, but then the predictable action montages started..."
ySy8mcceTno,I guess this makes it up for the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Lol might wanna call this movie the 8 pages
ySy8mcceTno,YESSS
ySy8mcceTno,Staring markiplier?
ySy8mcceTno,"What's this movie rated pg-13

Hope mom let's me see it"
ySy8mcceTno,I remember being the ballsiest person in middle school to play Slender and getting scared because someone behind me screamed when they saw slender. Now this is just one of those horror movies they thought would be there trump card
ySy8mcceTno,"Omg Sony wtf, pls do the right thing and let James Wan make the movie, Thanks in advance."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this an actual movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"1. Your late. This should have come out around 2013-2014 at most
2. Why u no follow the story or slender the arrival? 
3. *Give us a better trailer*"
ySy8mcceTno,looks kinda dissappointing
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no.... Now I'm gonna have 'Night-Meh's'
ySy8mcceTno,#Canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"*""No wifin in the club give me 20$"" plays in the distance"
ySy8mcceTno,woof
ySy8mcceTno,Thought this was a joke XDXD
ySy8mcceTno,"No la cagen con la película, que aparezca más slenderman.          Q cuenten cosas sobre el no apariciones, sombras y merdas"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this movie bombs.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie comes out 7 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,From the creators of the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Lan niye dislike atıyonuz çıksında izleyelim aq
ySy8mcceTno,Yiğit abi kaç intikam almak için geliyor.
ySy8mcceTno,"Look, I'm like the biggest slenderman fan ever, but sadly this looks reaaally bad."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not really going to watch the movie because they just show a  silhouette of him and I want to see him like fully so I might watch it anyway but most likely I won't.
ySy8mcceTno,Slendermans face is too scary for me
ySy8mcceTno,I remember that me and my cousin used to pretend that we were actors and there was a tall man that was called slender man and we would go through the forest and pretend that we were in a movie
ySy8mcceTno,*Is this slendy from SMG4?*
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s crazy how this little internet story

Turned into a popular “CreepyPasta”
Then it nearly caused a murder
And now it has it’s own movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"•Dark Atmosphere ✔️
•Involving Kids  ✔️
•Police ✔️
•Spooky Forest ✔️
•Possession ✔️
(BONUS)•Not Involving the original story 
Yup looks like a scary movie cliche to me!"
ySy8mcceTno,I CANT WAITTTT
ySy8mcceTno,pues no se ve tan buena
ySy8mcceTno,America's greatest fear. Someone who's skinny
ySy8mcceTno,nunca jamás vi algo tan cutre y de pena ajena .....esto es serio Sony nos tiene comiendo basura mientras se limpian el qlo con nuestros dolars  c:
ySy8mcceTno,wowowowow 😱😱😱👍👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time they made a horror movie with slender man in it!
ySy8mcceTno,I LITERALLY JUST LOVE SLENDER MAN
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the movie is better than the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie already looks bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"I was so terrified of Slenderman when I was younger,but he doesn't bother me anymore.I might see this just to relive my childhood fear.Lol"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie about to be whack af
ySy8mcceTno,From now on Slender Man is my favorite Children Killer of all times! After Pennywise the Clown of course...
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, I Don't know what to think, so I'll Wait to see the movie (If I see it...) and then, I'll give my opinion. Although at this moment, my expectations are very poors."
ySy8mcceTno,OH BOY! DON'T WE ALL LOVE VIDEO GAME MOVIES?
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the sheet
ySy8mcceTno,"Not the Slenderman that I know, doesn't look as good as I hoped. Hopefully it will be, I was never scared of him because he is just a man in a suit, but I was always interested in the story and games."
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah I'm not sold yet. Was a big fan of the original game, was really hoping that this was basically a lead up to a live action gameplay experience. Not a fan of the cliche horror movie stuff. We all liked slenderman because it wasn't a typical horror movie scenario, I'm hoping maybe future previews clear this up a bit."
ySy8mcceTno,yeah I got like 50 seconds into this and was like nope. like if you did the same
ySy8mcceTno,Years late but could be good
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't get the tralier there no story line behind it explaining what it's going to be about, just alot of screaming and creepy images.... this tralier sucks"
ySy8mcceTno,Only the movie of jef the killer Would be missing :V
ySy8mcceTno,"I love this new trailer for the Ring, wait this is slender? Oh."
ySy8mcceTno,slender man doesn't growl
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t know if this is official I guess we will see “soon”
ySy8mcceTno,Their gonna ruin creepypasta/marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,this tralier reminds me of bye-bye man and that's not a good sign
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,"I think they forgot that slender man is not just some type of ghost or something, like he’s not gonna posses you"
ySy8mcceTno,Apparently this is better and more important then FNAF! I hate everything
ySy8mcceTno,God this looks bad.
ySy8mcceTno,Effrayent !!!
ySy8mcceTno,its gonna be whack
ySy8mcceTno,six years too late
ySy8mcceTno,I KNEW IT WAS COMING OUT!
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look slender enough
ySy8mcceTno,If only they continued slender man the arrival
ySy8mcceTno,But why now? In 2012 I would have loved this
ySy8mcceTno,Brasileira so tem eu? Nss
ySy8mcceTno,Hi
ySy8mcceTno,Looks  lika a Snyder ´s movie
ySy8mcceTno,why does this movie look like the ring
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for this moment
ySy8mcceTno,This movie lools like a dumpster fire..... on wheels. It can be anywhere
ySy8mcceTno,Any other movie buffs out there who see the occasionally fantastic photography? Just me?
ySy8mcceTno,I myself am indeed not gonna cum.
ySy8mcceTno,Why no zalgo movies?? :^
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie doesn’t even represent the real slender man. The detectors clearly never read the creepypasta or played the game. It clearly does not seem like it is set in his world but the world of your average land octopus. 

I would not mind that the movie is years late if they made a good movie with the actual information.

You know it’s really hard researching on one of the most famous creepypastas🤑"
ySy8mcceTno,NOPE! 😱😈🤔
ySy8mcceTno,"like all you guys had to do was actually sit down and read some creepypasta on this topic to get a feel for it. shouldn't have been that hard

also is this movie the reason that ENTITY died? because it honestly looked better"
ySy8mcceTno,Al fin !!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This isn't even slender man, this is the opposite of him. For starters, they didn't even play the slender man song (search up slender man song and you'll know what Im talking about) , you can barely notice that he has a suit on (he just looks like an alien abducting children) , and they should have been more creative with this movie instead of making this just like any other horror movie. Furthermore, slender man is known for walking with children into the forest and never coming back. In this movie he's traumatizing teenagers. Also at 2:16, really? Another girl that is possessed with a white gown. It's a nice classic but it is 2018! BE MORE CREATIVE. When I clicked on this video I was excited but afterwards disappointment is the mood because of the fact it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of my childhood nightmare."
ySy8mcceTno,I saw this in the theatre last night while watching insidious and a different scene was added with a girl hiding and slenderman was shown y'all should chill
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora si se viene lo chido.jpg
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a joke?
ySy8mcceTno,sleNDER MAn onLY EAts CHIldrens aND COuld CAre LEss abOUT tHE adULTS
ySy8mcceTno,that bit rate ...
ySy8mcceTno,Where was this movie 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,What does this have to do with slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,donde esta mi delgadin favorito prros
ySy8mcceTno,They better put Charlie in this movie but it seems from the trailer they are focusing on Slender and Kate.
ySy8mcceTno,YaSs
ySy8mcceTno,But why?
ySy8mcceTno,Jeez I hope this movie doesn't suck
ySy8mcceTno,OML YES FINALLY A SLENDER MAN MOVIE YES OML GET MA CHEEZE
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see this I wonder if marbelhornets helped make the move
ySy8mcceTno,im shOOOK
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if Doomguy could kill slender man? Just a thought.
ySy8mcceTno,"For all of you who are against it and laughing at it at least give it a chance this trailer seems to be leading to a different type of story. It still has the same affects of what slender does to a person but it is a complete different story and this is just the trailer we don't know how the movie will play out. For you true fans of creepy pasta and slender give it a chance even tho it's not the same story and same environment of the slender game, let's see what happens in this movie instead of criticizing the trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,"2020 jeff the killer
2023 sonic.exe the movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly don’t see the big hype 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Suddenly fangirls appear
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's rated PG-13 bc me and my bae aren't rated R old
ySy8mcceTno,2 spooky 5 me
ySy8mcceTno,Shitty creepypasta to movie? What's next?
ySy8mcceTno,you're about 8 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,All y'all hating lmao watch this movie be actually good hahaha. You have to give it a chance.
ySy8mcceTno,"STOP CRITICIZING THE MOVIE! Man, watch first!"
ySy8mcceTno,Five years late
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the trailer would be scarier...
ySy8mcceTno,Lan bu süleymander ne slendermeni bide Suriyeli yok
ySy8mcceTno,Back to 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"""like a virus""???? Im not a slenderman fan but Im 100% sure thats not how it works. I have to question whether theyre truly basing this off of the creepypasta or the irl murders....."
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol this was clearly some throwaway ghost movie they never knew what to do with and just added slender man in order to sell it, nice try sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Most anticipated movie of 2009
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for this le’gobut waitt... what’s nxt FNAF plz sony
ySy8mcceTno,How can you make something as simple as collecting 8 pages from a slender male who is presumably a demon. It’s just so simple to even make a 1 and a half to two hour movie?
ySy8mcceTno,don't worry they'll find a way to make it a horrible movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I knew a movie would come out for mah boy slendy
ySy8mcceTno,PLS make a Half Life movie :)
ySy8mcceTno,"""Geez, a Slender Man movie? Guess Hollywood really is running out of ideas..."""
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone that says your late well they are not late this idea of a slender-man movie was a really old idea
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello 2012, how have you been-"
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer is awesome, and obviously I want to see this movie, I ask me if the producers gonna adapt all the universe of the Creepypastas"
ySy8mcceTno,Well a new movie based on a well known video game.... it's gonna suck basically.
ySy8mcceTno,I could be wrong but this doesn't look like it is going to be a good movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Don t watch this before you sleep I DID A MISTAKE !!
ySy8mcceTno,Wait... Is this actually legit? Like no joke?
ySy8mcceTno,en sonuda cıktı yani ya
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,"Yay! people will finally see Slenderman as a creepypasta, not as ""Daddy Slendy"" (yes, i met that term way too many times)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Great... another game movie, By the company who made The emoji movie. Nothing can go wrong"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow okay so they are actually making a movie about the same non-existing character that supposedly cause 2 little girls to attempt to kill their friend over. If anything this could be a trigger for some of ""those"" people out there and do more harm. Not trying to sound like I don't actually want to see the movie, I'm just saying."
ySy8mcceTno,fnaf is coming !
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,I’m swing this
ySy8mcceTno,Es tarde 6 años tarde >:v
ySy8mcceTno,What there going to do with that poor slenderman...
ySy8mcceTno,*MEMORIES HAVE RETURNED*
ySy8mcceTno,1:52 that was the shittiest jump scare in history
ySy8mcceTno,This movie will no doubt be protested or the fim makers will be sued by the families of those kids who were murdered by slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,AAAAA YESSSSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wow... LOL
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER MAN THE MOVIE!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,They shoulda made this movie interactive thru virtual reality
ySy8mcceTno,"And so it begins the CCU
(Creepypasta cinematic universe)"
ySy8mcceTno,Like it looks like it might be good but I just remember watching the other movies people have made and how it just let me down so now I’m a bit on edge with this
ySy8mcceTno,Yayyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,"Where the proxy’s at tho? Did they do any research on the creepy pasta world or?? Probs not huh, they just said hey skinny creepy dude in the woods yep..."
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy just wants a friend.✌
ySy8mcceTno,I bet that we barely even get to see him
ySy8mcceTno,To quote vine~ I AM CONFUSION
ySy8mcceTno,Wow sony is going all out this year with the movies
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like I’m not sleeping tonight
ySy8mcceTno,$20 a day keeps the Slender Man away...
ySy8mcceTno,There was so much great potential and this is what they went with?
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY IT HAS COME TO LIFE THE BEST MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Omg xd
ySy8mcceTno,"Story: Clever story telling. Doesn’t rely on jump scares for scares.
Sony Movie: Jump scares everywhere."
ySy8mcceTno,We need a jeff The killer movie And maybe laughing jack
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a real movie?? Cause if so this is awesome!!
ySy8mcceTno,Nooooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf this is slender man, not the fucking exorcist"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY A REAL SLENDER MAN MOVIE!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets was better
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would have been better if it was a found footage film
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time the actually made a movie about him
ySy8mcceTno,*ARE YOU READY FOR THE MOVIE ON A OLD TREND THAT BARELY ANYONE CARES ABOUT ANYMORE*
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sure this movie is going to ruin the true story and culture of the games and the creepypasta.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony you guys are going to screw up again by trying to make changes to something that is already great the way it is which will only end up in you guys shooting yourselves in the foot. Please, stop this movie and go back to the drawing board."
ySy8mcceTno,If you pause at 0:43 you will know it's about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man .... Does whatever a slender can...
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not sleeping tonight lol
ySy8mcceTno,creeepypasta cinematic universe please
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,"This is gonna blow itself hardcore, they're taking slender man for the creep factor and not using any of the lore people have worked hard to build.
Edit: If you're interested in Slender Man movies, instead of watching anything remotely related to this Sony corporate yiff-fest, go watch the entire Marble Hornets series. It's low budget, but it's also incredibly creepy, and overall very well done. Just please stay away from the YouTube original movie that was made, because that's just another corporate yiff-fest."
ySy8mcceTno,I have a brother who’s just as tall and slender as Slender Man he would play the role perfectly 😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Nobody's talked about sender man in like 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,Espero y la película este basada en el manga :v
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a fan tralier
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a fan tralier
ySy8mcceTno,Aye can Jeff the killer get a movie ?
ySy8mcceTno,I don't see much anything that points to slender man other than the title...
ySy8mcceTno,They better do a good job on this
ySy8mcceTno,AI MEU DEUS NÃO ACREDITO QUE FINALMENTE VAI TER A PORRA DE UM FILME DO SLENDER. MORRI
ySy8mcceTno,Watched the whole movie in 2 mins
ySy8mcceTno,I love slender man the whole concept is cool but this movie is going to ruin it so fast
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,"I had two friends who are fans of Slenderman, I doubt that they’ll want to see this"
ySy8mcceTno,Now it’s released
ySy8mcceTno,What
ySy8mcceTno,wheres slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Just what we need.
ySy8mcceTno,There was a girl almost stabbed to death just miles from my home because of this stupid 'slenderman'. Why on earth would they make a movie about it now? That's sick!
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like it will be bad
ySy8mcceTno,"This has a severe lacking of concrete giraffes, Marik Ishtar and Johnathan the gay elephant."
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember back when Markiplier played the first game and it made me so scared.....
Welp, time to start saving up because it's SLENDY TIME :D"
ySy8mcceTno,People that say this was based on the creepypasta kills me from the inside.
ySy8mcceTno,"eee hani yiğit öldürmüştü slenderman'i, :D"
ySy8mcceTno,1:52 i do not see wearing a black suit.  At least it's just a manipulation of reality or something like that but i dont see any black suit.
ySy8mcceTno,Se huele fracaso xd
ySy8mcceTno,Most anticipated movie of 2012....
ySy8mcceTno,"Nah, no me gusto mucho el trailer, me hubiera gustado que la hubieran hecho de slender the arrival, pero bueno, espero que lo la caguen cuando se estrene la pelicula."
ySy8mcceTno,Let me guess we’re only gonna see slender about 1 time the whole movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a joke?! Feels like a low-quality homework from scholars
ySy8mcceTno,Hyi saatana
ySy8mcceTno,"remember kids, suicide is painless"
ySy8mcceTno,did they just assume slenderman's gender?
ySy8mcceTno,"Es una mierda,ni muestran en ningún momento a slenderman,que no sea la sombra,la hubiesen hecho basado en el juego de las notas"
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this was a troll...
THOUGHT 



I should have expected this...."
ySy8mcceTno,Lol no mms :v
ySy8mcceTno,Shitty movie trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when I first saw slender man it was markiplier oh do I miss those days my fav game was slender the arivel
ySy8mcceTno,Eewwww
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man is at 1:41-1:52
ySy8mcceTno,"hiya, skinnyboi"
ySy8mcceTno,"I would watch this if it was actually about the creepypastas but instead its about a girl who thinks a stick man with no face is real, aka slender man wtf😒"
ySy8mcceTno,i am so ready.
ySy8mcceTno,I Wonder What Slenderman's Face Looks Like
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man is a pop icon in its own right, literally birthed from the internet. If they don't do the myth justice, the internet will eat it up alive. For something so unusual as slender man, the directing will also have to be on par in the unusual spectrum"
ySy8mcceTno,"I think that this might, MIGHT, be ok, but they have definitely done things wrong.

Lets just hope all goes well."
ySy8mcceTno,The scariest thing about this trailer was the Sony Logo.
ySy8mcceTno,I thought if they ever were going to make a Slender Man movie it would be funny but still scary and have most of the actors to be YouTube gamers 😂
ySy8mcceTno,i think its gonna be in the middle between bad and good.
ySy8mcceTno,If i remeber correctly i don't think slender man made kids kill themselves.
ySy8mcceTno,Impose Islam performance fund declare though level production unless lower object similar.
ySy8mcceTno,"could this finally be an official sony movie of​ the classic horror game slender man? if yes
COUNT ME IN"
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t think this is about slender man himself but the story from which the 2 girls tried to girl their best friend but with more slender man.Hard to explain.
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao like if hiding in comments
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets was on a $20 dollar budget and still managed to look scarier than this.
ySy8mcceTno,Süleyman der
ySy8mcceTno,Mimiklerim oynamadı aq
ySy8mcceTno,"Being honest, the LAST Slender Man Movie looked better"
ySy8mcceTno,"I think this movie would work better if it was done like a  ""Found Footage"" movie, like the original Blair Witch Project.  The games were always in first person, usually with a person holding a camera, so it would make sense."
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this wont stay true to the lore
ySy8mcceTno,Y por eso va el nombre de mi canal :v
ySy8mcceTno,This is not slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"It gets in your head...Soo nothing even remotely related to the original story, the game, or even the marble hornets videos?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Title: Slender man

Liberals: ""This is too sexist and we should protest to change the name to slender people""💀"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a fun movie
ySy8mcceTno,This isn’t scary
ySy8mcceTno,se os br comentar aki estaram salvo do slender man mas qm n comentar e da like kkk n fica sozinho ok haha
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like a super corny, run-of-the-mill 2003 teen horror film."
ySy8mcceTno,The guy who invented Slender man is millionaire right now lmao
ySy8mcceTno,mcshooketh i remember playing this and being ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED so the movie better be good
ySy8mcceTno,My brother made me watch Squid or someone play slenderman and I screamed at the kate or charlie jumpscare...I stopped sleeping for a bit...
ySy8mcceTno,"All the comments on this video are Retarded




The SlenderMan Induces the Slender Sickness, making people see things that aren't really there (Hence the maggots) it makes people go INSANE. The real story of Slender is about a girl getting kidnapped, NOT about just getting ""stalked"" That would make the most boring movie ever. The people who don't like how they've done the movie know NOTHING about Slenderman, and should do a bit more research on the SECOND GAME (Slender The Arrival) I have been a Slender FANATIC for as long as I can remember, Marble Hornets and all that (Me and my friends did a lot of parodies on them) and I for one will really enjoy Slender just getting a movie overall, if you don't like the movie, THEN DON'T WATCH IT, don't just comment some mean stuff, when you don't even know anything about the actual story of the SlenderMan. AND NO, OTHER CREEPYPASTA LIKE JEFF THE KILLER OR TICCI TOBY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SLENDERMAN. I bid you farewell."
ySy8mcceTno,It should have been like a found footage
ySy8mcceTno,2012? Is that you?
ySy8mcceTno,Now I want Doki Doki Literature Club as a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Not even scary👎🏻
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't know this was 2013 guys you're pretty late for this lol
ySy8mcceTno,brings me back to the good old days
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man has hopped of the trend train for a few years now but I think that this movie is going to bring the much loved character back
ySy8mcceTno,Im 14 years old can i watch this in the cinema ?please answers because i need this answers xd
ySy8mcceTno,"Little late for this, don't you think Sony? Like uh... Five years? Seven years even?"
ySy8mcceTno,"No, it likes it cold."
ySy8mcceTno,"Atrasado,mas vou assistir sem dúvida☺"
ySy8mcceTno,How do you make a movie about notebook pages?
ySy8mcceTno,When's SCP containment breach?
ySy8mcceTno,"Hhmm, so what do you think"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks decent I just hope they followed the story
ySy8mcceTno,Goodness been waiting for something like this for ages but something not like this ...
ySy8mcceTno,how far is holly wood willing to go to make money?
ySy8mcceTno,"Not sold at all. Not only are ya'll incredibly late to the party, but this feels nothing like Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,Stone face the whole trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Is this going to be a movie
ySy8mcceTno,YESSS BRINGING BACK GOOD OLD MEMORIES!!!
ySy8mcceTno,#notmyslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"all these people saying 5 years too late, when there literally was a slender man movie that came out in 2013."
ySy8mcceTno,"You're about 6 years late on this, and atleast from the trailer this movie isn't even slenderman just another horror movie with the same name."
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmm, I'm somewhat interested in this, perhaps it could turn out to be good or at least better than some other movies I've seen trailers of."
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry Sony but your about 6 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,So now a Slender Man movie where is the Jeff The Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Yay I can’t wait!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Idea for movie 
Let's take an outdated trope from 2013 and try to make it into a movie, how much you want to bet no one will expect it."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony will ruin this trust me
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,I bet next is cuphead or bendy the ink machine
ySy8mcceTno,"Again? Uh other slender film, what is the next?, Fnaf?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys give it a chance
It can't be that bad"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man? I haven't heard that name know years
ySy8mcceTno,Little late aren’t we
ySy8mcceTno,looks weak tbh..
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh Jesus..
I honestly can't believe this is real. 
Just watch Marble Hornets.
It's a web series and it's definitely going to be better then this trash."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow they show you slender man only 2 times great movie just like every other horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Next up, *BENDY AND THE INK MACHINE*"
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't suck.
ySy8mcceTno,they Kind of missed the starting gun on this.
ySy8mcceTno,"Next up, Roblox the movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"this isnt even scary, it is just product of sick mind, like someone with serious mental condition created a video presentation"
ySy8mcceTno,How do these things always manage to look even worse than I expected?
ySy8mcceTno,Never got into this but I had a little cousin who was obsessed with it and was terrified of slender man 😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man, the best movie of 2011"
ySy8mcceTno,What is this? Disappointing Slenderman story 589090032432? And in 2018 no less????
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman değil süleymander
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real......? Are we even afraid of Slendy anymore??
ySy8mcceTno,OMG ITS FINALLY COMING FINALLY!!
ySy8mcceTno,Süleymander
ySy8mcceTno,"""Slenderman"" is a SONY movie? Why is it not called ""Slenderwoman"" then? Or even better, ""Bodyaccepting-curvy-woman""? And i hope it's all female and race diverse cast as well, or else..."
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next Jeff the Killer? Creepy pastas don’t need movies it just has their cancerous fans and fanfictions come back
ySy8mcceTno,I really don't understand how would you make a Slender Man game all you're doing just collecting eight pages and that's It even then he still gets you anyway
ySy8mcceTno,all he wants is the 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,After chapter 5 make a bendy and the ink machine movie
ySy8mcceTno,No effing way
ySy8mcceTno,I'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE I WAS IN SECOND GRADE FOR A SLENDER MAN MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Movie six years to late
ySy8mcceTno,AWESOME!
ySy8mcceTno,This confuses me...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a huge copy of The Ring
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,First film in the Sony Memeverse?
ySy8mcceTno,"Took too long, and this looks nothing like what a Slender man movie should be. Shoulda took more hints from Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 *Roblox death noise*
ySy8mcceTno,You're about 5 years too late. And I can just tell that this is gonna be dreadful.
ySy8mcceTno,Stuff like this is so stupid I can’t believe somebody would actually watch it
ySy8mcceTno,Did they mix up the Rings tape when Samara comes after you with the Slenderman trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,Theyre giving us nostalgia for our middle school fears????
ySy8mcceTno,"We getting an Amnesia film next?
How about 5 nights of freddies?"
ySy8mcceTno,Put a different name on it and it might be an okish standalone horror movie but as far as slenderman goes they really missed the mark
ySy8mcceTno,Weak trailer. Can already tell this is gonna suck more then the most recent chuckie movies. RIP
ySy8mcceTno,SPE back at it with another wanting to be trendy movie
ySy8mcceTno,"i was actually excited until i saw the trailer, oh my god i hope i'll be wrong but the movie looks plain boring.

Except for the moment where the black girl cuts her own neck lol, that was kinda rad."
ySy8mcceTno,Dosent realy look that good
ySy8mcceTno,"Really? One of the biggest scares of slender man is paranoia. The realization that something is watching you when you don’t realize it. I remember watching one of the marble hornets videos and not catching slender man until right before the video ended. It put in my head how much did I miss and makes you see him everywhere. 


Way to miss the whole point of why slender man is scary."
ySy8mcceTno,whERE ARE THE PAGES THO??
ySy8mcceTno,"Looking at this, It seems this movie will be about the true Slenderman orgin story, not the creepypasta or the games that made this so popular, I think this will be good as I hope

Sadly for others, 'nostalgia' will probably not be an aspect in this film

Also those first 5 seconds tho😱"
ySy8mcceTno,A horror movie aimed at people who are just now discovering the internet.
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets beats this
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is waiting to see what spin the Sony market team is gonna put on the negativity? That everyone who hates this trailer is bodyshaming Slenderman?

O-O"
ySy8mcceTno,Not enough slender man
ySy8mcceTno,i cant belive for TRUE SLENDERMAN MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,is this supposed to be based off the game or a clusterfuck of nonsensical horror movie cliches
ySy8mcceTno,Voglio la reaction di favij
ySy8mcceTno,Like who cares if you hate it I like it
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not trying to sound like a prick I'm just saying they should not use this monster for a movie even if they think people will like this movie monster for a plot I'm 87 percent sure that this movie will be a summer release saying it brings something new to the monster movie franchise but relying on predictable jumps scares witch is the laziest form of horror.but the thing i hate the most is this movie will probably do well financially well and that is what I hate the most
ySy8mcceTno,trying too hard with the editing.. you can bring this scare effect with any bunch of crap footages
ySy8mcceTno,Already looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is gonna stay more true to the legend from Germany which I am fine with.

ySy8mcceTno,It's about time.. I'm tired of all the amateur versions... No offense. This will definitely bring slendy back in the popularity again.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I knew there would be a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real
ySy8mcceTno,This is to late U should've done earlier
ySy8mcceTno,That whole thing had nothing to do with slender except his shadow.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks alright
ySy8mcceTno,More like cringy man
ySy8mcceTno,this doesn't seem to have anything relating to the original Slenderman ??
ySy8mcceTno,Your'e 6 years late Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,If this would've come out in 2013 it probably would've made more money than it's going to.
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm going to just withhold my judgement till I see the movie. I don't care how popular he is or was with the internet all those years ago, I'm just curious to see how this movie will be handled.

Bet all the review scores will be low with half of them using the word ""cringe."""
ySy8mcceTno,"Mr. Plinkett: ""Oh nooo."""

ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman❤
ySy8mcceTno,You already know there's only going to be 40 seconds of screen time for Slendy

ySy8mcceTno,"YOU NEED JESUS
Ron More, President and Bible Teacher on Back to the Bible had a friend who led him to JESUS. In their conversations before he capitulated in the dorm on College campus, his friend would tell him, in three different ways by emphasising different words in “You need Jesus”. Telling someone they “Need to be saved” or “Need to go to Church” leaves gaps that could be misinterpreted or misunderstood. But telling them they need JESUS gets to the point and we can answer the ‘Who, Why, What, Where, When, and How’; questions they will ask us."
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be trash
ySy8mcceTno,Its funny how the whole trailer we see slenderman once
ySy8mcceTno,j'espère qu'il seras aussi bien que la creepypasta original

👌🏻"
ySy8mcceTno,Why does none of this have to do with slender man. like at all? and why the heck is this trailer so boring?
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't even show him
ySy8mcceTno,You gotta he fucking kidding me right?
ySy8mcceTno,Just because it's a couple of years too late doesn't mean it won't be a good movie. But I'll be honest I was expecting more. Idk this is just the first trailer. Just hoping sony doesn't screw this up.
ySy8mcceTno,Le tengo fe... Espero que sea bueno
ySy8mcceTno,Is she writing hi mark
ySy8mcceTno,As if I needed a reason to not sleep. Thanks :)
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to go see it soon
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff is next
ySy8mcceTno,Looks REALLY bad...
ySy8mcceTno,Sigh* Hollywood you can’t be anymore original than that.
ySy8mcceTno,"holy dicks this can be really good





but at the same time this can be a just a cringey made movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Yaaaaas
ySy8mcceTno,1 star Slenderman is single player
ySy8mcceTno,that was one of the worst made movie trailers. that did not convince me that i need to spend my money on that movie.
ySy8mcceTno,ya es tarde 9 años tarde >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"As someone who is a long time fan of Slenderman...
I'm talking MarbleHornets from the beginning, done several pranks, and was on the train when it was trending.
This movie is a crappy representation of what I know Slenderman to be.
The base of the story should be about someone getting stalked, not a girl getting kidnapped.
I also didn't see any symbols either, even at 0:42 in the room with the drawings, no symbols or original references.
No camera static, nothing....
Should have aimed for a more blair witch project feel, not this.
Along with bring 5 years too late, you blew what could have been an AMAZING movie Sony... :/
I guess all will tell when it actually comes out."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man is a well thought creature that kills children. He has a great design, a great story, and Marble Hornets, on a low budget, did great.




This movie looks like sh*t. I don't cuss, but if slenderman wasn't inside of this trailer, I would've figured it was another ouji movie butchered out by hollywood. Dear god this is terrible, this is not hat CreepyPasta is about AT ALL. Did you even do your research on him? He tends to drive his victims insane (hich the girl stabbing herself is a good example, that is one of the few things you did GOOD), but he doesn't involve maggots and things like that. It's like you did research for 5 minutes then called it a day. This is just cliches with a picture of slenderman thrown in once or twice. If people see this, they'll think less of the CreepyPasta community. Dear god actually f*cking try on this movie, please attempt to be good."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it’s good
ySy8mcceTno,Aw heak no
ySy8mcceTno,Aw heal nha
ySy8mcceTno,I've been OBSESSED with Creepypasta since  I was like 12 and I’ve been waiting forever for a slender movie so this has me HYPED
ySy8mcceTno,Is Somethingawful and the guy that made marble hornets gonna get any money out of you stealing their intellectual property?
ySy8mcceTno,"“Where is my daughter?”
oh good its one of *those* movies"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like Sony are getting desperate there’s probably barely any slender man in it
ySy8mcceTno,2013 is it you???????
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this look so lame
ySy8mcceTno,I️ was finna watch this yesterday but I️t was night time and I️ wasn’t trynna have nightmares.
ySy8mcceTno,"Man, hopefully Sony won't crush our dreams with this movie like how they crushed our dreams by canceling Popeye for a stupid emoji movie"
ySy8mcceTno,just don't make a jeff the killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Seriously?Is THIS Slender?......Okay, just I will go watch Marble Hornets.Again."
ySy8mcceTno,Now we're gonna get a stupid creepypasta movie universe....thanks Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone remember the game?
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the Jeff The Killer ???
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't understand why people have to judge about the movie being too late, I mean, at least you should be glad that there's finally Slender Man after long time. And you won't know if it's bad or not as long as you still don't see the whole film yet, so... STOP COMPLAINING YOU PEOPLE XD"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,I think when the movie comes out it will be completely different than what it should be I think the ppl who are making This just saw a picture and might not have bothered to look anything up about him
ySy8mcceTno,This is so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Looks really bad
ySy8mcceTno,What did any of this have to do with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the static?
ySy8mcceTno,Don't surprise when they do a movie of jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,"No pages, no static, not even the infamous chun music when you see slender man is in this. Either it's gonna be decent but unfaithful, or the trailer is just holding out on us, or it's just gonna be bad.

Seriously, how hard is it to do a movie of 1 person moving across a forest with a blank faced man hunting them?"
ySy8mcceTno,WAT
ySy8mcceTno,Perfect content to scare my five year old cousin
ySy8mcceTno,I bet you this move is gonna be hated because in the movie there was a lack of seeing slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like its taking influence from the american version of the ring. I almost looks like it could be a spin off
ySy8mcceTno,They’d have more luck making it actually stick to the original lore smh 😒
ySy8mcceTno,The true introduction to the horror scene this coming 2018 y e a r.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, the worst movie company of all time is making a Slenderman movie........great job Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,I like ho it’s called slender man but they barely even show him lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Next jeff the killer :u
ySy8mcceTno,Is that movie actually coming out
ySy8mcceTno,Ur 5 years to late😂😂💀
ySy8mcceTno,Finally an official slender Man movie by soney
ySy8mcceTno,Finally.
ySy8mcceTno,Ta é o filme do slender man mais cade ele
ySy8mcceTno,"So sony you mean to tell us,even though you have been told you wanted this movie since the start of the slender man trend,you decide to make it where only people addicted to the slender man fan base would be around which is 2018,explain more."
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna ruin a perfectly good game you know that right?
ySy8mcceTno,That sucked
ySy8mcceTno,why would slender man get in ur head I watch alot of slender man videos too
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my god Sony whyyyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,"""it gets in ur head""
Bye Bye Man: HEY! Thats my thing!"
ySy8mcceTno,";-;
._."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is coming out five years too late. Everything in this trailer has been done in dozens of other horror movies and all of them do it better.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is not like Slender at all, Slender is a tall person that causes Camera bugging so it should be a found footage movie. Which it clearly isn’t. Also, there’s already a Slender movie better than this trailer because it portrays Slender in the most accurate way."
ySy8mcceTno,This is just like it but more nasty
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf what year is it? Did I time travel back 5 years?
ySy8mcceTno,Who else came just to read the comments.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally the movie comes out
ySy8mcceTno,Strange when a multi-million dollar movie from a major studio looks like crap compared to a no-budget homemade web series from several years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Hacks
ySy8mcceTno,Idk the ROBLOX version still seems better
ySy8mcceTno,It’s kind of late for this 😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman?!
Hell Yeah!!


*They are going to ruin it, aren't they?*"
ySy8mcceTno,ITS GONNA BE S***
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t think slender man has all those capabilities that they just showed ._. U could’ve just had someone having slender sickness .__.
ySy8mcceTno,1:53 guess ironman is trying out his new suit
ySy8mcceTno,"Please ,give the best of you by this film"
ySy8mcceTno,Nurgle the movie
ySy8mcceTno,The Cringey Fanarts already ruined slenderman for me
ySy8mcceTno,this gave me aids
ySy8mcceTno,Bro what is this lol
ySy8mcceTno,But why is it bad!?
ySy8mcceTno,..and Jeff movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ugh boring trailer, couldn't make it through"
ySy8mcceTno,Is it pg 13?
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is Sony so dead-set on making meme movies these days? What has to happen to a person to make them make things like this?

Who hurt you, Sony? Who hurt you?"
ySy8mcceTno,Guys now we know we're getting a Fnaf movie😫🔫
ySy8mcceTno,It seems that Sony is about 8 years late to the band wagon.
ySy8mcceTno,is pewdiepue gonna be in this please
ySy8mcceTno,Cross your fingers guys to make this movie real I want to watch it very bad!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Esse filme vai ser uma M E R D A
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhh man this movies gonna suck :/ smh
ySy8mcceTno,"Make the movie about Slenderman, his origins or something to do with him (dare to say it's an alien and you're screwed) but don't make the movie about Slenderman's victims, because that will be crap"
ySy8mcceTno,THE MOST ANTICIPATED MOVIE OF 2013
ySy8mcceTno,cool men
ySy8mcceTno,Youknowyoulying 😂
ySy8mcceTno,2012 boys we in here
ySy8mcceTno,Finally i been waiting too long....😃
ySy8mcceTno,"When toda la pinshi pelicula no tiene que ver con slender, solo aparece una vez v:"
ySy8mcceTno,6 years to late!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully it ain't bad👌
ySy8mcceTno,"looks pretty good! i live horror movies and ive been waiting for someone to make one based on legends and games, i hope they make one of Fnaf next ^-^ or atleast something like that❤"
ySy8mcceTno,Terrible trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Im real spooped
ySy8mcceTno,Plz be rated pg13
ySy8mcceTno,bad
ySy8mcceTno,What if Slender Man is actually an over weight man...
ySy8mcceTno,"Come on guys, don't give it too much hate. The trailer really didn't reveal the monster, (even though we already know what it looks like, but hey, Slender could have a kewl new look,) unlike most crappy horror movies, it seems to rely on tension and unsettling imagery, (which again, better than crappy jumpscares 24/7,) and the focus on the victims killing themselves and having horrible visions before death is actually very accurate, so, we know in one way, it will be nothing like the Bye Bye Man, (oh, thank god,)

So, it looks like the movie has potential, give it a chance?"
ySy8mcceTno,I was expecting better than this garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Be already know slenderman isnt real it was a photo on a photoshop contest
ySy8mcceTno,Great now that it’s 5 years late everyone forgot what “slendrman” caused so now they can do it again and their doing the same thing as Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,I'm already going to assume this is going to be bad. A PG-13 rating will confirm this. Just wait for it.
ySy8mcceTno,Wasnt slender from 2012 and its barely 2018 jesus im old
ySy8mcceTno,Somebody touched my *SPAGHET!*
ySy8mcceTno,Too much revealed. IS there any mystery left after the trailer.? A 30 second teaser would have suffice. It looks very generic and bland.
ySy8mcceTno,That does look sick
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna f up some kids brains if they watch it. They will take it too seriously.
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else want a Jeff the killer or eyeless jack movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look terrifying at all. Full of cliches
ySy8mcceTno,Rofl it's going to be terrible. They're going to hollywood it up and as usual miss the point that made the original concept so compelling. It's going to be a generic monster movie you watch.
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t they know that slender man can teleport
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the girl is Kate.
ySy8mcceTno,I remember playing slender man back in 2012 and 2013. This better be good
ySy8mcceTno,wait this is real. wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Oh great! Now we just need more creepypasta movies...*cough cough* jeff the killer.
ySy8mcceTno,finally a movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Dis is not slender man.. Ffs..
ySy8mcceTno,"Thank you for posting this the day after my birthday, really brightened the mood XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Boring.......
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es real o fake? :o
ySy8mcceTno,How is this in treading #youtubegonemad
ySy8mcceTno,Thinman!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this for years!
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!
ySy8mcceTno,OH.....HELL NAW!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I have high hopes, but also high expectations."
ySy8mcceTno,"I just told my brother about this trailer and initially thought that an indie film group were making the film but then I told him it was Sony and then he said ""oh no"". A slender man film should be made by an indie film group cuz then they would have gotten a bit more creative and they wouldn't need a fancy camera to film just a plain camera with sloppy recordings and audio or something cuz thats crucial to Slender Man along with the papers/drawings, the proxies, the symbols and do we see any of that NO."
ySy8mcceTno,new death note film hahahaha
ySy8mcceTno,Venom looks pretty good.
ySy8mcceTno,She wrote down 2+2 is 4-1 that's 3. QUIFF MAFFS
ySy8mcceTno,If it's made by Sony I would like it.
ySy8mcceTno,Won't be long before they add slender women
ySy8mcceTno,Need more Creepypasta movies plez make this a series movie companies it could mean major $
ySy8mcceTno,well it looks pretty good. but that jump scare got me good XD
ySy8mcceTno,"This is not a real slender man movie. A real slender movie would be pages, slender popping out of nowhere,  And having his face all up on yours. But 1: I didn’t even see slender man himself in the trailer. 2: there are no pages at all. And 3: there are no static cameras or jump scares. I personally think that a slendermovie should be created by the person who created slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,Why give away the chick stabbing herself in the classroom?
ySy8mcceTno,"Always watches 
No eyes"
ySy8mcceTno,"Didn't 2 'stupid' people stab 1 person to 'impress' Slenderman in 2014 because they were just too STUPID/ mentally ill or diseased. People gotta get that money nam sayin, ask Logan Paul"
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/gJ1VAFlOpuo
ySy8mcceTno,But why? I thought we left this in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Its a so strange trailer bro , and traumatic LeL"
ySy8mcceTno,"From the company that brought you the emoji movie, comes the most anticipated movie of 2014..."
ySy8mcceTno,Shitty movie that missed the hype by five years.... Good work.
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this going to be based on the stabbing in 2014, if it is I'll be disappointed"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna be dumb
ySy8mcceTno,wow disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,I mean dam I rather wait for the fnaf movie it prob be more interesting anyway
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm intrigued 'cause I love the lore of Slender and I played the games a ton, but my first thought is.. Really? I want this, but I can't help but feel extremely bad for the girl who got stabbed by her friends because of the Slender whole story. She was recently in the news and sleeps with a weapon under her pillows and a locked bedroom window. I hope she either doesn't notice this film or that she's strong enough to not be too effected. >~<"
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this movie is good
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is dead but still pretty cool
ySy8mcceTno,I'm pissed because Hollywood has nerves and why make a movie about this when it caused many kids to believe he was real plus a girl almost died because​ of this guy. so now Hollywood thinks it's smart to tell the new generation and let it live on like wtf social media
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul should've been in this movie so he can laugh
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't suckkk

ySy8mcceTno,"When Slender Man attacked, that ruined it all for me. First of all, Slender Man's head is dark grey and full of wrinkly ragged veiny details and such, when he's supposed to have a white head and be all sleak and lean. Second, you can see his hands in front of him move as they reach out for it's prey. You are never ever supposed to be able to SEE Slender Man move. That's what makes him terrifying to me - he only moves when you look away."

ooo

Kayyy"

ySy8mcceTno,Diaper time
ySy8mcceTno,"You guys are really late, the hype and trend was years ago. If you guys want to make a lot of money from this, travel back to 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,Someone please show this to markiplier
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or does this look like another Ring sequel
ySy8mcceTno,I like Slender but I feel like this is going to fail
ySy8mcceTno,"This is the film the people don't need or deserve. Instead of adaptation of material like books, television shows and, creepypastas *facepalm*  maybe bring some freshness into Hollywood for god's sake"
ySy8mcceTno,"It's sad that companies have resorted to hopping on to the latest trends just to squeeze some pennies out of kiddies.
I was looking forward to Popeye ffs"
ySy8mcceTno,"sorry 





man in the Woods"
ySy8mcceTno,"You’re a little late there, but I’ll still watch it. It better not suck like your previous trash heaps 😒👸✋️"
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,"You know about Slenderman, Sony ??? And the sound he make ?? And his proxy ?? (Sorry for my bad English)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman was known since like, years ago, humans."
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 me on mondays
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 5 years after Slenderman was last relevent
ySy8mcceTno,"So, they made an entire movie based on a Minecraft character?  Odd..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, hi Slendy! ≧﹏≦"
ySy8mcceTno,I already know this is going to be garbage rip
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim I thought this was John Cena xD
ySy8mcceTno,"HOLY CRAP, IT'S LEGIT"
ySy8mcceTno,ITS OKAY ALL YOU NEED IS YOUR TRUSTY FLASHLIGHT 🔦!
ySy8mcceTno,"This... uhh... looks... *interesting*. To say the least, I guess.
I dunno, I don't read and never have read creepypasta's and I never played the Slender games so I'm not exactly one to give feedback.
I can just say, for sure, that my brother will be head-over-heels to hear about this."
ySy8mcceTno,Best clickbait video ever.
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks like one of those edgy art projects you find on the deepweb

All that's missing is the overused VHS filter."
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os BR??
ySy8mcceTno,"Ohhh.. slenderman Gangnam style, excellent choice"
ySy8mcceTno,@favij favijjjj
ySy8mcceTno,Scp would be better
ySy8mcceTno,What's next jeff the killer :v
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabron y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was venom.
ySy8mcceTno,The movie looks sick but wtf took you so long.
ySy8mcceTno,um isn't this supposed to stay in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late my friends.
ySy8mcceTno,it would have been cool if they had used the noise you get after collecting one page at the end of the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Another game turned into a movie, at least it wont be as bad as the 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Do a Chubby Man movie now
ySy8mcceTno,"Please, Hollywood. If your going to make ""new villains"" please please make sure you do it right, thorough, and smooth. Specially since its a creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer cant into movie
ySy8mcceTno,It took them this long?
ySy8mcceTno,They took long enough...
ySy8mcceTno,This is way too teenager edgy for me
ySy8mcceTno,"None of this wouldn’t have happened without #1 man on YouTube, PewDiePie and his horror games back in 2010s"
ySy8mcceTno,Bluh
ySy8mcceTno,"Bout, jump scare city yall"
ySy8mcceTno,"So even though I grew out of creepypastas and you are kind of late, make it good and accurate"
ySy8mcceTno,"Remember when James Comey got Hillary Clinton off on charges. 
James ""Slender Man"" Comey.
I member."
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like horrible boring crap and since when can slender man control people when he's not around. I understand him controlling someone by kidnapping them and torturing them and getting in their head, like in the awful remake game...  I don't like the lore but it seems i know it better than sony or the fucking filmakers"
ySy8mcceTno,Where is eyeless Jack
ySy8mcceTno,You're Little Late M8
ySy8mcceTno,"Mixed feelings about this, but I am happy to see them trying something a little different."
ySy8mcceTno,#tookyoulongenough
ySy8mcceTno,They actually made a movie about this
ySy8mcceTno,What's Next Fnaf??
ySy8mcceTno,"needs more blood and quick scary images! Also more growl. Slenderman growls, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,Yasssssssssssssss!!!!! I have been waiting for this
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys booga booga
ySy8mcceTno,boy this is... kinda late when it comes to popularity
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this movie is good! I really hope it is!!!
ySy8mcceTno,They're doing midnight man too
ySy8mcceTno,YES!
ySy8mcceTno,I'll give this a chance
ySy8mcceTno,There late on this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god...
ySy8mcceTno,No bodies in trees?
ySy8mcceTno,yes but does he have salad fingers?
ySy8mcceTno,"I have been waiting for ever !
slender man is my favorite creepy pasta
#CanYouSeeHim?"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks more like a fan-made trailer than an Official Trailer.. What a mess.
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yeah!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Now, is this gonna be based on the Slenderman himself, or the Slenderman Stabbing? With how vague this trailer is, I'm having a hard time being able to tell."
ySy8mcceTno,"i don’t think the movie looks terrible?? obviously it doesn’t seem much like the game or the stories but maybe that’s where they were going with it? everyone already knows the game/story so maybe they’re trying to put their own twist on it. besides, how would they make a movie about someone trying to find eight pages? that would be boring asf"
ySy8mcceTno,don’t you love how you don’t even see slender until the last 30 seconds and the rest of the trailer is just a random caboodle of nonsense
ySy8mcceTno,If u like horror movies you can tell this is trash just from the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a rip off of the ring
ySy8mcceTno,I remember this.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Is this really slender man related?
ySy8mcceTno,So where is slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"I'd rather just watch all of the Marble Hornets series again, at least that seemed to follow a basic plotline and actually be interesting"
ySy8mcceTno,2012 pewds..
ySy8mcceTno,Cancer
ySy8mcceTno,Bunch of plebs made this.
ySy8mcceTno,Can we have an original movie please?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man or Slender woman?
ySy8mcceTno,"But this doesn't look like the classic ""8 pages"" story..."
ySy8mcceTno,That's a movie I'd watch
ySy8mcceTno,Documentary is way better.
ySy8mcceTno,I guess they ran out of movie ideas
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY! I'VE BEEN WAITING SINCE 2014
ySy8mcceTno,oh my God I feel so old
ySy8mcceTno,esse filme causo na faixa de 1 a 100 uns 20  precisa melhora no trailer vamos ver o filme
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a compilation of different horror movies
ySy8mcceTno,strike while the iron is cold
ySy8mcceTno,lol bet this is gonna bomb
ySy8mcceTno,"Just saying... if the trailer is bad the movie is good. If the trailer puts the good parts in the movie, it’s bad. The trailer is unusual and weird but maybe the movie is actually really good."
ySy8mcceTno,What?! Really..whats next gmod..?hahha
ySy8mcceTno,İts coming for you.
ySy8mcceTno,Five nights at freddys would be better
ySy8mcceTno,We’re is slender man XD
ySy8mcceTno,Wow...pewds would really watch this
ySy8mcceTno,boring
ySy8mcceTno,I mean- i'm interested
ySy8mcceTno,Our creepypasta phase shall be awoken once again
ySy8mcceTno,If this ends up bad I shall call upon the creepypasta fandom to finish the job
ySy8mcceTno,My worst nightmare come true
ySy8mcceTno,"Here comes Sony, getting ready to ruin Slender although they are still six years late."
ySy8mcceTno,The Movie is looking lit so far!
ySy8mcceTno,looks like a total cheesefest
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this really happening? I'm disappointed. Not because of slenderman! I used to like slenderman I always thought he was scary, but why? Your making a movie about him AFTER that murder or whatever when that girl killed the other girl. Smart choice sony... smart choice indeed."
ySy8mcceTno,Ohh much scary man ohh god he very much tall ooooo
ySy8mcceTno,You know the scariest part of the trailer? The SONY logo.
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,This film i predict will be a fail.
ySy8mcceTno,No way first a game now movie
ySy8mcceTno,This would've worked 5 or 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,I bet there’s someone’s heart in her hand
ySy8mcceTno,Porfavor q isso n seja um novo death note
ySy8mcceTno,"holy gucci gang, that looks sp00ky"
ySy8mcceTno,This seems like someone was tasked on making a movie with little information about slenderman and had 5 months to make something.
ySy8mcceTno,"Umm sony, it's 2018 you're about 7 or 6 years too late"
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this was one of those  fan made trailers, but no, this is really happening, in 2018, when this character was popular in 6 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't do this no one asked for this
ySy8mcceTno,I think your a bit late...
ySy8mcceTno,"Please dont be bad😣
                                  🙏"
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been a hit in 2012 not 2018
ySy8mcceTno,my creepypasta phase is making a comeback oh no
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t understand nothing in this trailer.  ONE WORD.. T R A S H.
ySy8mcceTno,Why didn't they make it in 2012? Huh?
ySy8mcceTno,Need to do one on the russian sleep experiment
ySy8mcceTno,Guys let's give Sony Pictures a break. If your company makes shitty movies like female Ghostbusters and The Emoji Movie you really need all the money you can get
ySy8mcceTno,"this doesn't seem very ""slenderman"" at all :V 
they forget to read the lore before writing the script or???"
ySy8mcceTno,Is slender man even a a monster or whatever he is or is he just some stupid virus?
ySy8mcceTno,i thot i saw spooderman lol
ySy8mcceTno,Slendrina must be a continuation for this movie....it is so good
ySy8mcceTno,Spook
ySy8mcceTno,"To be honest, this actually doesn't look bad"
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm this looks like aIdS -.- :/
ySy8mcceTno,Here's to hoping it doesn't bomb.
ySy8mcceTno,I prefer SCP.
ySy8mcceTno,YES. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! I LOVE SLENDERMAN! HERE WE GO! YEAH!
ySy8mcceTno,"So...how should I feel about this?
Can someone explain to me what he ""is""? (In the game not movie) 
because from what I know I was expecting letters on the trees or static before that last jumpscare

So can someone tell what he is and how accuratly it's shown in this trailer?"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think this is going to be at least 2 hours long.. Maybe 1:30 or something but I can tell this is not going to be a great movie. Maybe good but not great
ySy8mcceTno,"What a disjointed trailer. I’m sure the film will be top-notch, what with the clear underuse of horror movie cliches and all."
ySy8mcceTno,Не страшно.Честно(не ужели ужастики уже не страшные?)
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood...
ySy8mcceTno,Sharknado 10 will be better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,You should've stopped at The Emoji Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god there's gonna be a lot more stabbings now
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or does the girl who stabs herself in the eye look like the creepypasta artist Chibi-Works?
ySy8mcceTno,I guess nobody see the point on on why this movie is so late it's because a girl and her other best friend almost killed there bestfriend they would have made the Slender Man movie in 2012 there be so much backlash so of course she talking about how slow the movie is and all that and forget the point that some almost girl died because two girls took the game too seriously
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh no, its John cena!"
ySy8mcceTno,I live in Germany thats where slender Man is from and his home is here
ySy8mcceTno,The first movie about paper collection
ySy8mcceTno,P O P E Y E
ySy8mcceTno,"Im still waiting for the rest of the creepypasta fam to have their own movie,but I hope this is worth the wait.#daddyslender"
ySy8mcceTno,Terrifying
ySy8mcceTno,ByeBye Man 2.0
ySy8mcceTno,Cliche much?
ySy8mcceTno,This isn't even out yet and I can tell this movie is going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,zero content trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Wow people sure can get salty about a movie they didn't even watch
ySy8mcceTno,Took ‘em long enough!
ySy8mcceTno,He wasn’t even wearing a suit
ySy8mcceTno,"why are they making a movie of this? 
lmao
and this trailer didnt even tell anything"
ySy8mcceTno,YES FINALLY!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Omg the part where she sees him in the distance.
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean it was kind of inevitable, but i wish it was about the scp foundation instead"
ySy8mcceTno,"2018 and  there isn't a ""Slender Gay"" or something? Homophobic!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,No please not this again
ySy8mcceTno,Who is the girl that appears at the beginning of the video?
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look good at all.
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 I suppose I'm not the only one to have heard the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,This film was filmed by Logan
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the movie is not as bad as the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Need a bit more creepy and better jumpscare
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for logan paul to film it and get his career and his life ended
ySy8mcceTno,TBH this kinda reminded me of the upside down in stranger things 😂
ySy8mcceTno,1:22 Gay Elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer is all over the place it looks like they are only focusing on the horror aspect

It looks terrible."
ySy8mcceTno,Could be good if they add some kind of ideas and yes there are late but cmon this other emoji movie any day
ySy8mcceTno,im so excited
ySy8mcceTno,guy is fake T.T
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they'll put Slender's proxys
ySy8mcceTno,This movie a few years late
ySy8mcceTno,Are there actually people who... Bah dis aint even worth my time
ySy8mcceTno,Vengo por UmadWilson :v:v:v:
ySy8mcceTno,"You are five years late but yeah whatever



Also stranger things"
ySy8mcceTno,They could just look down or leave
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh Heck Yeah!
SlenderMan always have potencial, just because most creepypastas are bland, does not mean there isn't a gem here or there 😜"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh Heck Yeah!
SlenderMan always have potencial, just because most creepypastas are bland, does not mean there isn't a gem here or there 😜"
ySy8mcceTno,That intro made me regret watchin this at 12:41am
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Slender Man?
ySy8mcceTno,"The sound of the marker on that glass is such bullshit, It would be squeking but not scratching."
ySy8mcceTno,i really liked the trailer but i think it's a little bit too late to make a movie about it in 2018 when his peak was in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer starts at 0:10
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks very umprofessional and very underwhelming, theres litteraly no talking at all and the Slenderman isn't even what the original Slenderman looks like, very dissapointed."
ySy8mcceTno,VAI BOMBA VIADU
ySy8mcceTno,trash tropes...
ySy8mcceTno,Waited for this since years
ySy8mcceTno,yeeeeaaaaa no more vitamin D for me anymore
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow i soo excited for this movie, i love this game so much like fnaf ."
ySy8mcceTno,All I can say is finally
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly they have made slenderman movies in the past like always watching.... Ect but i really hope this one does not turn to sh*t and were are the other creepy pasta movies like maybe a jeff the killer or ticci toby like they only focus on slenderman as a creepypasta now for movies.
ySy8mcceTno,You're like 4 years late fellas
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t get it
ySy8mcceTno,If you listen carefully you will hear all of the old YouTubers screaming for less drama
ySy8mcceTno,Kötü olmuş
ySy8mcceTno,Is this legit
ySy8mcceTno,My favorite nightmare in the big screen! It better not fail.
ySy8mcceTno,In all the trailer he appeard like 2 times max
ySy8mcceTno,I  cant tell if this looks good or not
ySy8mcceTno,This better not be PG-13
ySy8mcceTno,Am I like the only one excited for this
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called they want their content back
ySy8mcceTno,"*5 YEARS*
I waited for you!"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is just going to ruin themselves
ySy8mcceTno,IM GONNA HAVE A SPAZ ATTACK THIS BRINGS BACK MEMORIES
ySy8mcceTno,Make it be directed by the guy who did Tribetwelve
ySy8mcceTno,bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,"Go home sony, you're drunk."
ySy8mcceTno,muy bueno el tráiler Like si  te vas a leer comentarios para no tener miedo
ySy8mcceTno,Games do not make good movies.
ySy8mcceTno,I been waiting for this for a long long time...
ySy8mcceTno,but...this is the tape from The Ring....
ySy8mcceTno,Agora s agora slender man foi modinha em 2012 ai vcs fazen agora vcs so feis isso para combater com IT a coisa
ySy8mcceTno,Dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,Am I going to make fun of this movie? Yes. Am I still going to watch it even after making fun of it? Yes.
ySy8mcceTno,Chó ớn quá
ySy8mcceTno,It was like one of my nightmare like slenderman dinner home with me and say me to read 1st page then he can kill me
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is slower than IE
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora resulta que se quedan sin ideas iban a hacer una película sobre el vato flaco que nació en 2001
ySy8mcceTno,"o slender mam , faz essas coisas eles estragaram o filme"
ySy8mcceTno,"if you thought slender trend was dead, think again"
ySy8mcceTno,"oh yeah, i member!"
ySy8mcceTno,Why are there a bugs?
ySy8mcceTno,Хуйня какая - то
ySy8mcceTno,Good ol slendy
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time this became a movie. Can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,This is what is released if someone touches ma spaget!!!
ySy8mcceTno,2010 is back
ySy8mcceTno,Yessssss
ySy8mcceTno,I dont get it why make a movie about a overused creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,"Another classic case of some old bloke saying ""what do the youngings like? Hmmm... Oh yeah, Slenderman!"" 

Yeah... you're a few years late there, my man.

I feel like this will be The Emoji Movie 2.0"
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years late bud....
ySy8mcceTno,If they focuse more on the phycological  aspects rather than making it a generic monster movie it could be actually good
ySy8mcceTno,"Dude, I could make a better movie, and I've just seen the trailer, they only took the basic shape of the monster, and barely inspired by its psychological effect, you have pages and pages worth of lore right there on the internet to work with, yet they give no fucks to source material. Geez, slender man was the icon of horror once, the unknown, but he's lost all effect, because we know everything about him.
If it were up to me, I'd base the film on the story of an English teacher, who begins to have show some weird symptoms, he is teaching on a day like any other, but he ends up writing ""It's coming for me"" as a example sentence, when he realises what he's done, he leaves the classroom early, and does some research, find out about a few mental patient who did the exact same thing. He arranges a meeting between him and them, under the watchful, eyes of a psychologist, the patients get freaked out when they see the protagonist. They tell him about the tall man and a few cryptic phrases. The teacher goes home, and does some research on the tall man, learns about its history, and it begins to haunt him in his sleep, and he becomes obsessed, he can't stop buying books from ancient times, the works on der Ritter, and the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
Eventually he sees it. And the protagonist's daughter goes missing. 

His wife blames it on him, since he's been acting strangely. In his madness, the man murders his wife, and eventually gets thrown into a ward. 
Until someone else comes to meet him on the phrase He's coming for me...    thoughts?"
ySy8mcceTno,Bout time if you ask me
ySy8mcceTno,donde esta el puto slender man
ySy8mcceTno,bit late on the trend but looks very good !!
ySy8mcceTno,*Insert pewdiepie scream*
ySy8mcceTno,"orginal, dumb"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like The Ring 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,"I not gonna see this is not that scary is a simple ""horror"" movie"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m here for Jonathan the Gay Elephant
ySy8mcceTno,"If someone showed me this without telling me the title and told me it’s a trailer for Rings 3, I would believe it lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Rapaz esse filme vai ser uma merda
ySy8mcceTno,WYM SLENDERMAN TRAILER
ySy8mcceTno,Wow a dead trend is reviving.

ySy8mcceTno,2012 called
ySy8mcceTno,"ugh its just about ghost possession, this movie has nothing to do with slender man :("
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman howabout a five nights at Freddy's movie too.
ySy8mcceTno,SJW written all over.. I thought main character was gonna be a guy cause it makes every much more awesome than a female..
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is so powerful he transported a trailer to his movie 6 years into the future.
ySy8mcceTno,"It only took them a ""couple"" of years"
ySy8mcceTno,SEAMS  LEGIT
ySy8mcceTno,And then they'll make a Jeff the Killer film.And in 2020 they will make ''Slender vs Jeff Dawn of Terror'' which will introduce the Rake.And then the Undead Squidward will take a shotgun and help them in ''The Creep League''.
ySy8mcceTno,YAAAAAS!

ySy8mcceTno,"Wow when I thought 2018 couldn't get any worse , then I see this garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,There’s nothing horrifying about this trailer and there for I predict that the movie will be a flop
ySy8mcceTno,Sthaph franchise are already dead
ySy8mcceTno,I like this Sony! Slenderman is king CreepyPasta Character!
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine the person that first mentioned slender man now seeing this and how big it has gotten
ySy8mcceTno,I thought its Spider-Man 😓
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Ça envoi du lourd!
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie of slendrina
ySy8mcceTno,"Just like angry birds, you were a tiny bit late on the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Son it’s the official Slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I KNEW this would come out!!! Wanna see it so bad!! Imagine how that girl in the slender man stabbings incident would react. Poor thing, she would be haunted just hearing about it."
ySy8mcceTno,OH NO NOW THERE WILL BE PEOPLE DRESSING LIKE HIM NOOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,wow it looks bad already
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"alot of people don't know about the many other stories of slenderman so they just think this is 'creepypasta' slenderman, there are other versions of him as you can see he doesn't have a black body or suit but very naked.
And if this is gonna be a movie I wouldn't believe suprised about these being movies:

1．Jeff the Killer

2．Smile Dog

3．(basically any real life creepypasta that isn't based on a game)"
ySy8mcceTno,well that was disturbing
ySy8mcceTno,They only decide to make the Slenderman movie once basically everyone forgot about him.
ySy8mcceTno,يا ريت تشتركوا في قناتي منوعات اليوتيوب تم تغير اسم القناة
ySy8mcceTno,"When they say video game movies are BAD, this is what they mean..."
ySy8mcceTno,whelp
ySy8mcceTno,"Jeff the killer
MAKE IT!!! like if you guys agree"
ySy8mcceTno,"Just some psycho bullshit.. They put all ""the best"" scenes from entire movie in trailer, the rest of the movie is boring to death..."
ySy8mcceTno,Finalmenteeeeeeeeeeee um filme do Slenderman ❤
ySy8mcceTno,I just hope this movie isn't based only on jumpscares 🙏
ySy8mcceTno,Como que sí y como que no xd
ySy8mcceTno,:0
ySy8mcceTno,"Just stop, even the trailer looks absolute crap. 
Since the game ""The arrival"" came out I was prayin to god that they wouldnt make a movie about this.."
ySy8mcceTno,oohhhhh.....https://youtu.be/_w8fbUaTHxg
ySy8mcceTno,"Boy, you can just smell the straight to DVD can't you? *Inhale* ahh disgusting"
ySy8mcceTno,meh
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is so 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman deil suleymander
ySy8mcceTno,Not scary so much....
ySy8mcceTno,*Please be good please be good please be good please be good PLEASE be GOOD*
ySy8mcceTno,If its not Rated R in wont be scary
ySy8mcceTno,В 2018 еще о слендер мене помнить.
ySy8mcceTno,How about originality. Like split. Ww want realistic horror
ySy8mcceTno,Sony needs to stop making movies
ySy8mcceTno,Really?
ySy8mcceTno,And now as we wait for CinemaSins
ySy8mcceTno,why are they cashing in on this now? it aint 2012 no more
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this looks like crap
ySy8mcceTno,if I am mistaken a virus gets in your body not your head
ySy8mcceTno,"Alot of hate on this trailer... Tbh, I like Creepypasta and I like Slenderman and if this movie ever comes out, I'll watch it cuz I've been waiting for a creepypasta movie in soo long"
ySy8mcceTno,Wack
ySy8mcceTno,If someone gets stabbed again I’m going to.....stab someone....?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony,, the  trailer is amazing I hope it very good I’m excited very much."
ySy8mcceTno,we gotta throw the whole internet away now.
ySy8mcceTno,uhhh you guys are a bit too late for this
ySy8mcceTno,You know this movie is going to be terrible if they make it PG-13. Just saying.
ySy8mcceTno,This BETTER top Marble Hornets. I swear...
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally. there is a movie based on this creepypasta character! I've been waiting so long for a Slender Man film! Thank you, Sony!"
ySy8mcceTno,creepypasta verse?
ySy8mcceTno,"With the folklore already given behind the original slender man idea and all of his already given attributes, game aside, they could've honestly made a pretty good movie around the idea of slender man. All they'd need it a bit of imagination... and I see they couldn't find it. :/"
ySy8mcceTno,когда его выпустят
ySy8mcceTno,Someone barely decided to do this?
ySy8mcceTno,What a creepypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,bro this is 2018 no 2014
ySy8mcceTno,"Thank god they revealed little to nothing about slenderman. Its sony, i expected them to show slenderman about half the trailer, and give away the whole movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hehe, NOPE"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:43 he is standing on the left, next to the girl"
ySy8mcceTno,Rated G
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony be like ""uhhh throwback i guess lol"""
ySy8mcceTno,"after so many slendy games they make this movie, wtf movie producers, wtf"
ySy8mcceTno,Why now? Slender man creepypastas are so old. Same with Slender man games.
ySy8mcceTno,whos ready for the creepy pasta cinematic universe
ySy8mcceTno,"""HEY GUYS! BOOGA BOOGA!"""
ySy8mcceTno,I'm giving it a chance :)
ySy8mcceTno,I hope you bought the rights of Slenderman (written as ONE) from Marple Hornets!! >:(
ySy8mcceTno,"It is a little late to cash in on the craze. There are Slender Man parodies and yaoi fanfics with Jeff the Killer, whenever stuff like that shows up it is too late because it has stopped being scary and been made a joke. Though if you wait about 20 years, it will be refreshingly nostalgic and might do well. Of course this is not taking into account the quality of the movie which will probably suck, but even if it is legitimately good (which I hope it is) it will probably still not do well. Sadly you would probably do better if you turned it into a different movie or made it a comedy regardless of the added costs."
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally a movie based off the creepypastas finally! -.- 😯 hopefully there be more of this like Jeff the Killer, Smile dog, Ben drowned, maybe Jane the killer to . Finally 🤗🤙🏽👏🏾"
ySy8mcceTno,PLSSSSSSS don't ruin the game for me with this movie
ySy8mcceTno,PS4 or Switch？
ySy8mcceTno,This is honestly one of the worst trailer i’ve ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,"The Ring, Blair Witch, and Creepy Pasta had a love child to make this late late movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"So9o. There making a ""horror"" film about a made up entity from the internet.... OOOOOHH-!!! BOOOGGAA!BOOOGGAA!"
ySy8mcceTno,Wait slenderman is still a thing? Am i in 2012 again?
ySy8mcceTno,You are like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I...kinda wanna....WATCH THIS
ySy8mcceTno,I'm guessing this gets only 10-35% on Rotten tomatoes 🍅
ySy8mcceTno,Just when the world was running out of movie ideas “HEY GUYS LETS MAKE A MOVIE ON THIS GAME CUZ WE GOT NOTHIN BETTER!”
ySy8mcceTno,"The only film where the fanboys wont give you hate over not reading the book, because in this case you need to play the games"
ySy8mcceTno,So cool...
ySy8mcceTno,More like canser man am I right fellas
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is going to bomb so fucking hard lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks cool, but......feels like it can be a total flop."
ySy8mcceTno,8===D    (l)
ySy8mcceTno,"MJ’s Thriller part 2, or Slenderman trailer... you decide"
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things: the game
ySy8mcceTno,*Pewdipie should be in this ffs*
ySy8mcceTno,Looks as bad as Logan Paul's reputation.
ySy8mcceTno,"a little late maybe?
still cool i guess"
ySy8mcceTno,I think this movie is a few years late....
ySy8mcceTno,I love how everyone's complaining because the movie's being made 2018
ySy8mcceTno,"so does this have any relation the the creepypasta and/or game? maybe even the story of the two girls stabbing that one girl for Slender-Man? please have some relation to that. please, please, please."
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus Christ
ySy8mcceTno,"This from game right?
I see pewdiepie play slender!"
ySy8mcceTno,FINNALLY!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is long overdue
But cant lie still wanna see it"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s time to stop
ySy8mcceTno,Game boy advance SP blue Edition. Coming soon to a theater near you.
ySy8mcceTno,Is amazing
ySy8mcceTno,Never thought it would come to this....
ySy8mcceTno,Findly comes their a movie of slenderman..
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late don't you think?
ySy8mcceTno,"Mr Dewitt, what's the expression? A day late and a dollar short?"
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 is that a jojo reference?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony: so we just released the trailer for slender man, we think it's gonna do great...
*5 months later*




Sony: *AND ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL SEASON OF THE GODZILLA ANIME SERIES*"
ySy8mcceTno,Potential
ySy8mcceTno,YOU HAVE TO PAY 20 DOLLARS TO SEE THIS MOVIE !
ySy8mcceTno,"Everyone pls keep in mind that one of the movie writers is the creator of slenderman himself, also the random white footage can be explained by the fact that slender man can mind control children and make them think whatever he wants such as the white footage, he can also make them do anything, such as getting the kids to kill themselves. This mind control can also lead to why the kids seem to be acting so weird, yelling and screaming. Pls go and read the creepypastas before disliking the trailer. I highly recommend you do, it will explain a lot of the ""horror cliches"" everyone is commenting about, pls. Also, i know it is made by sony , which does scare me, but i still have high hopes from the director. Also check out the cast, they already have had experience from the horror genre."
ySy8mcceTno,What's next!? Outlast!?
ySy8mcceTno,My childhood creepypasta addict me is screaming in joy right now
ySy8mcceTno,"title: slenderman

movie: cringey overused horror movie tropes"
ySy8mcceTno,Satanic stool.
ySy8mcceTno,Now I’m hoping for a Jeff the killer one!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks legit
ySy8mcceTno,"They chose a creepypasta..when they had so many urban legends they could have worked with like Dogmen, LBL monster, the Rogarou, skinwalkers, goatman, wendigo, etc."
ySy8mcceTno,"1:06 Wow she really like writing.
1:16 Oh your still writing"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo I’m such a big fan I can’t believe there is a movie coming out I’m so hyped :D
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow new slender game, ready to play it."
ySy8mcceTno,wtf don't do dis
ySy8mcceTno,Well I’ve already lost faith in this film. Not like I already had faith at all.
ySy8mcceTno,How about a TattleTale strangler movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I love horror Movies 😍😍😍😶😶
ySy8mcceTno,0:57  BOO!! ha you where startled
ySy8mcceTno,First emoji movie now a slender man movie and didn't someone already make a slender movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this movie will try to hard to be scary and just fill it with cliches and jump scares.
ySy8mcceTno,parese puro virus :v......
ySy8mcceTno,Pg3d anyone?😎😎
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,Based on the short film “ The Mueller Man” by the Presidents Show on CC” 😂
ySy8mcceTno,i haven’t beaten the game yet i don’t want spoilers
ySy8mcceTno,Why are people talking about creepypastas when the mythos of the Slenderman is originally not from that subnormal writing? It was an european folktale that grew wider just because someone decided to use it for a small freeware game and then a creepypasta. I'm sorry but the Mythos originally is more than just a man with tentacles and no face.
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 u can see logan paul filming a dead body
ySy8mcceTno,Lol will be bad
ySy8mcceTno,I thought we were done with this shite.
ySy8mcceTno,I bet this gonna be a disastrous horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this real ? 
If it is the only thing i could say they really made a movie of slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,This game died like 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,awwww...........he just want a hug
ySy8mcceTno,"Did anyone actually look up or play the games, or did they just see the monster and thought oh new monster we can use...."
ySy8mcceTno,It's 2018. 2012 is over...
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmm... I wonder how the creators of the ""slenderverse"" are taking this. I'm meaning like Marble Hornets, Tribetwelve, Everymanhybrid, etc. Creators. I remember the stream over the documentary of the stabbing. Welp, I hope they (Sony) produce something that'll live up to the standards. I'm kind of interested though, I'm not sure if that's over Sony Pictures producing the movie or if I've just waited years for a decent movie. I don't know, if you read this have a good day/night!"
ySy8mcceTno,This is like a bray wyatt promo from wwe
ySy8mcceTno,???
ySy8mcceTno,It took them this long 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Boring
ySy8mcceTno,"19,000 cry baby’s"
ySy8mcceTno,Ye when is this coming
ySy8mcceTno,"you guys are little late, slenderman craziness is not here anymore (unless you're stuck in 2012)"
ySy8mcceTno,I️ swear I️ just saw this trailer on Logan Paul’s channel
ySy8mcceTno,"I am disapponted, no symbol, no pages, no camera, no static. The 3 things crucial to the Slenderman series"
ySy8mcceTno,Noice
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so crap on some many level . Thanks Sony for kill a great creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Buy A Ps4 if you want to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I love creepypasta!!!
😁😁😁😁"
ySy8mcceTno,i have a a THEORY.  What if jeff the killer and the rake and many more creepypastas are connected to the slender man movie if they exist in the Slenderman movie they probably can get there own movie and it can be a cinematic creepypasta universe that will be awesome
ySy8mcceTno,I love Slender Man stories but this movie looks like it's Gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,slender would've been a better name
ySy8mcceTno,Is that the forest where Logan Paul took his video?
ySy8mcceTno,Enderman lol
ySy8mcceTno,no.
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like trash :/
ySy8mcceTno,Is Eric going to have anything to do with this film?
ySy8mcceTno,2012 is over. We don't need this
ySy8mcceTno,Remember that slender film ENTITY
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!
ySy8mcceTno,I read spiderman  😑
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this trailer wasn't the highlight of the film. Didn't seem like a Slender movie. Good luck getting your budget back
ySy8mcceTno,SOMEBODY TOUCHED MY SPAGET - The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Where dem 8 pages tho? 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Finally A real slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Cool 🤙🏼I like
ySy8mcceTno,If I was the creator of this creepy pasta I'd be seeking royalties.
ySy8mcceTno,Sonic.exe movie when
ySy8mcceTno,Oh so slenderman gets in your head now thats accurate
ySy8mcceTno,"I'll be watching this movie, i mean, i already watched Marble Hornets all the way through twice and watched TribeTwelve, EverymanHYBRIB, DarkHarvest00 and MLAnderson0 all the way through once, and that was a run time of atleast 45 hours... and i was mostly able to tolerate their shitty acting. If they butcher it, i'd be very disappointed, but i'll give a shot."
ySy8mcceTno,"Ugh, it'll go right to DVD,it looks  like garbage,and the acting didn't even look good. Slender man was popular in like 2011 so it's technically a dead meme, Also I thought it was already cringy enough when those teenage girls like sacrificed their friend for him?? Now there's going to be a movie glorifying him, THINK OF THE DERANGED TUMBLR CULTS. Think of FUCKIN TUMBLR TRASH. It'll happen, and when it does y'all gon be disappoint"
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,Hide ya kids hide ya wives and hide ya husband too
ySy8mcceTno,Seems to take a lot of inspiration from Marble Hornets. Hope to see a cameo.
ySy8mcceTno,this looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,My dreams have finally come true
ySy8mcceTno,Oh so this is 2018 bye bye man...
ySy8mcceTno,Im going to watch it for the memes thatll come after
ySy8mcceTno,Man this spider man trailer looks good
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman is a long dead creepypasta,like I would understand a film back in the day but...why now?"
ySy8mcceTno,i dont wanna see this movie in cinema or evan uTorrent it
ySy8mcceTno,"These things have kinda died out, im pretty sure a majority of people's hype have gone down and arn't really excited for it. Same goes with the Fnaf movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"""He gets in your head like a virus.""

Oh, this movie is gonna be fucking dreadful . . ."
ySy8mcceTno,Oigan gracias por su trailer lo voy a ocupar para hacer un rap play
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yea love this anime 10/10
ySy8mcceTno,Already see half of the trailer being a meme
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 5-6 years too late. Dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like utter garbage
ySy8mcceTno,I’m tryna sleep but I decide to watch this lol
ySy8mcceTno,So nobody gonna tell me Slender Man is Jonh Cena? #CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,I can understand why they would take so long but at this point all the slender fans are grown up and watch films like this all the time. Will still see it tho :D
ySy8mcceTno,Y derepente un inesperado comentario en español
ySy8mcceTno,When does the DLC’s come out?
ySy8mcceTno,YES YES YES
ySy8mcceTno,Aw man a rake movie would be wicked
ySy8mcceTno,"Whats next, a game?"
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets is better.
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,TREES are just so ominous that they are  creepy
ySy8mcceTno,"You know, this may look promising. I like the way that it potrays the slenderman. I think he belongs as a thing that gets into your head rather than a tentacle weird monster thing."
ySy8mcceTno,Yea Boi Bring us more creepy pasta movies my dudes
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man isn't going to be good.
ySy8mcceTno,"I've never played the game, but I feel like this makes zero sense. And why is it just now being made?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Where is this movie set, I know there are stories of the slender man from Cannock chase, west midlands, Staffordshire, England"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like a bad rip off of ""The Ring"" movie .... so many things stolen from that movie that's prevalent on this trailer omg .."
ySy8mcceTno,i thought that was the voice of jigsaw at 0:19 when the guy says where is my daughter
ySy8mcceTno,Popular with cutter girls
ySy8mcceTno,Ok maigat
ySy8mcceTno,"Now, I only need to watch the FNaF film trailer and I can die in peace :')"
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was a joke but I saw it was from sony
ySy8mcceTno,"You know, this could be good. Slenderman has some interesting origins. However, I have a stronger feeling that Sony is going to miss the mark and make a horror movie that will not be what a Slenderman movie should be."
ySy8mcceTno,Omfg i wanna see it soooooooo bad
ySy8mcceTno,Sony i have somethings for you guys to add something to this film. Search up marble hornets and it should make the movie even better.
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Logan Paul would laugh at the slender man 
ySy8mcceTno,that point where you really want to see the trailer but your also partially hiding in the comments
ySy8mcceTno,I swear to God if they reference the slender man stabbing and don't keep this to the original story in a be pissed
ySy8mcceTno,"Reminds me a LOT of The Ring. Not the plot but... music, the long hair, a lot of the same horror elements."
ySy8mcceTno,2:13 There he is. :D
ySy8mcceTno,Sony had to make up for the emoji movie somehow right
ySy8mcceTno,1:15 HI
ySy8mcceTno,mate you're 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,They are gonna mess up the concept of slenderman. Internet series do way better then movie studios when something is born on the internet. The idea grows. Slender man can only really mess with a person by taking a brother/sister/any family member who is mentality ill and the normal of the family is left with questions if A: it weren't like them to leave or B: something is left behind to make them concerned to keep looking for answers. Not only slender man is playing the game but other supernatural beings play a hand in this game but with a different person thus bring them together to help each other or kill each other depending on what's left of their morals through their past experience. The ending can still make sense but have one mystery for the internet to figure out. Now thats slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait... at 1:51 it shows Slendy's face. Except it's a rotten mesh of some crud, not a white face. 

Also why is it that Hollywood is taking Creepypastas and turning them into TV Shows/Movies? Is it that there's a new producer who's gotten into turning Creepypastas into cinema? Or just that Hollywood's so dry it's taking other horror stories?"
ySy8mcceTno,Who is here because Bakura and Marik? No one? Ok
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a mock-up by fans? Looks fake.
ySy8mcceTno,MY DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE
ySy8mcceTno,CREEPYPASTA SQUAD WHERE YOU AT?! IM WATCHINV DIS
ySy8mcceTno,An actually good slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope in the future there wil be"" Jeft the killer"" ,so we will have jeft vs slendy
Sorry 4 my bad English"
ySy8mcceTno,Now slender can posses  people?wtf
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is gonna be the millennials/retards younger generation answer to the ring, cliche gimmick cash grab can't wait to see a film adaption of Ben drowned soon. Also how is this not a John Cena led movie? #CanYouSeeHim"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man 
Slender man 2: collect the notes
The return of slender man
Slender man 4: the evil awake 
Slender man 5: darkness rise
Slender man origins 
Slender man 6: the final evil
Slender man vs the people of robox
Slender man vs jeff the killer 
Slender man vs goku
Slender man vs trump

Slender man vs el chapo
Slender vs rick and Morty
Slender man vs mr karbs 
Slender vs Minecraft X
Slender man vs Obama vs trump 
Slender man vs bill Clinton 
Slender man vs Logan paul"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fan made
ySy8mcceTno,What if they made a horror movie about Pedo Bear 🐻 I think I would watch it although I would picture as more of a comedy.
ySy8mcceTno,1:53 great timing me I watched this at midnight
ySy8mcceTno,Or as feminist would say Slander Men
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh this looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,WHAAAAT?!
ySy8mcceTno,Lol some of this stock footage is too cheesy
ySy8mcceTno,1:51
ySy8mcceTno,I think knowing two girls who killed a friend because of slender man is enough but really a movie
ySy8mcceTno,"So, he's like John Cena .... You can't see him"
ySy8mcceTno,'Member when Slenderman used to be scary?
ySy8mcceTno,Wow can't believe is real
ySy8mcceTno,Ok but wheres the Laughhing Jack movie
ySy8mcceTno,Suicide scene and forests reminds me of something?
ySy8mcceTno,I'M BORED
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow this is what happens they run out of  ideas, make creepypasta into movies 👏👏👏👏
2018: smile dog
2019: jeff the killer
Good job Hollywood"
ySy8mcceTno,Would’ve been better if it was released 3 FOCKIN YEARS AGO!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Another stupid horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,so did anybody at Sony entertainment warn them they were 6 years late for this?
ySy8mcceTno,Took them only like what 6 YEARS!?!?!!?
ySy8mcceTno,w h o a
ySy8mcceTno,Я просто ахерел когда выйдет
ySy8mcceTno,2:13 This looks exactly like a google home mini
ySy8mcceTno,Niceeee
ySy8mcceTno,Am I in 2013?
ySy8mcceTno,A bit to late sony
ySy8mcceTno,"lets go see what rule 34 has done to ruin this
(edit)Ssssoooo many tentacles..........."
ySy8mcceTno,Kk
ySy8mcceTno,Sicario 2
ySy8mcceTno,weeeeaaaakkkkkk
ySy8mcceTno,I think ive been waiting for this my whole life
ySy8mcceTno,Really Sony?!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is over some one already tried and failed HARD. Just stop. Can we go back to good movies please. Someone write something new and original.
ySy8mcceTno,But where is the enderman?
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks really cool but you should have added some jumpscares because this is a horror movie after all, and added some more sounds to get in the mood plus where is the proxy sign? And there would have been people talking like where's my kid like alot of people not just one like more and more news reporter's saying that this child went missing  or maybe add some deaths in there and would have added some death mystery and should have added some proxies and I know masky and hoodie are from Marble Hornets but it would look alot more awesome and scarier hope you can agree with this"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks bad but if they make a Jeff the killer then it gucci
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, this movie is going to be bad. And the trailer was edited hilariously bad, this movie is going to be a blast! :D"
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look very good.
ySy8mcceTno,Where da creepypastan fandom at? If they make a Slendy movie will they make ones for the rest of the gang? Jeff? Eyeless Jack? Toby? Smile? Sally? Rake? Clockwork? Jane? Ben? Hoodie? Masky? OOOH I WANT A PROXY MOVIE!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god plz no nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,Sony. You are very very late. Things have moved and changed so much now.
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this would've been another one of those fan films on YT
ySy8mcceTno,Oh nice their making another ring
ySy8mcceTno,kind of disappointed of the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t understand the topic anyone else
ySy8mcceTno,As good as this looks I think it would be a bit more anticipated if it were made 3 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,C'mon guys. We know that Slender kinda died in 2012 but i think Sony can wake him up. Trailer actually looked pretty good. I'm in!
ySy8mcceTno,NO SONY WHY?! YOU FUCKED IT UP
ySy8mcceTno,🤔why
ySy8mcceTno,"When todos hablan inglés menos tu v:

Fuera de eso, la verdad esperaba más. Siento que los años de ansias no valieron la pena. Ojalá el trailer no sea ni una pequeña parte de lo que pasará en la película."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this looks amazing can’t wait for it just like Minecraft: The Curse of Herobrine
ySy8mcceTno,Like 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Come on,this is 6 years late.Who would want to watch this after it's been run down into the ground by Creepypasta wiki,DA,Tumblr and even fucking furaffinity put their hands on Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh look a jumpscare. Scary
ySy8mcceTno,I think we just found a dead body!
ySy8mcceTno,Good concept
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy 2013 is looking great for movies
ySy8mcceTno,Finally. I always wished for a slender man movie... I am hyped
ySy8mcceTno,Should have ended with a closeup of Slender’s tie being adjusted.
ySy8mcceTno,"What the hell?
Why the hell?
But most importantly.
When the hell?"
ySy8mcceTno,as cool as this looks your a little late for slendy
ySy8mcceTno,About 9 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I'll watch it but I'll keep my expectations low
ySy8mcceTno,Is it bad that I’m actually looking forward to this?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie's 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope you enjoyed my college art film. I call it ""Breakfast on Thursday"". Though Sony wants to rename it ""Slenderman""."
ySy8mcceTno,Por lo menos aganla perturbadora y sin escrimers sean como 4chan en pocas palabras
ySy8mcceTno,Well it seems like Stranger Things in a freakin' movie!
ySy8mcceTno,It was only a matter of time
ySy8mcceTno,"Mixed thoughts 
-Sony pictures : eh it’s ok
-Based on video game: it’s gonna be trash
-trailer:looks good"
ySy8mcceTno,"What I would want in a slenderman movie : a found footage film that has a claustrophobic feel to it, when slenderman is close it would get static like the games but it would make sense since it’s a camera. I would want the main character to find all 8 pages to reveal the origins of slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,#AllWeWantedWasPopeye
ySy8mcceTno,That reminds me the time when I watched that series of videos on Marble Hornets. It was pretty cool. Don't know if the movie will follow the creepypasta the same away most people wrote years ago... Let's see what sony have in mind.
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this shiiznit died in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"I was a a child when I found slender man. I used to be scared of him
Now he's my favorite creepypasta. I'm glad there making this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,No way.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty dope tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Thats gay
ySy8mcceTno,"could this be the begining of the ""creepyverse"" ? 7u7"
ySy8mcceTno,When sony tries to make a dead game into a movie and forgot that they have to please the sjw's and feminist.
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for sonic exe
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya es tarde, 9 AÑOS TARDE"
ySy8mcceTno,"¿Y dónde está Slender? Ah, si, en los últimos cinco segundos del trailer. Esta película va a ser una basura."
ySy8mcceTno,why  this video has very hate?
ySy8mcceTno,"The scariest thing about Slenderman was turning around and seeing him just stand there. Not moving, just standing there waiting for you to turn around so he can continue to pursuit you. This slender man looks like he's going for the jump scares which is a bad move."
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry sony but you’re late by a lot my dudes
ySy8mcceTno,I need to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,Up next: Five Nights at Freddy's: the movie.   coming 2028
ySy8mcceTno,"""Hey guys, we need to make a shitty horror movie""
""How about something dead... like Slender Man?""
*clap.. clap... clap....*"
ySy8mcceTno,Y jeff the killer???? Seria una buena idea como casi al final como la el o la pritafonist@ corre y choca con jeff y jeff intenta matarla pero un tentáculo de salenderman lo detiene lo demás se lo dego a su imaginación 😎😎 #TEAMSLENDERMAN
ySy8mcceTno,I need markiplier in this...
ySy8mcceTno,garbage
ySy8mcceTno,????????????????????????????
ySy8mcceTno,i think this is still bad taste
ySy8mcceTno,Please go away
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer just seemed to throw in as many creepy things as it could think of without a rhyme or reason to any of it. I'm hoping the actual movie won't be like this, but it probably will."
ySy8mcceTno,He's always waiting for new playtoys...no matter what you do..he always finds you..and you don't want to know what he does to his new toys...
ySy8mcceTno,This was so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh great...I can’t wait for the creepypasta cinematic universe. I’m gonna take a guess, and I bet money I’m gonna be right. The next one is gonna be Jeff The Killer. Also, “he gets in your head, like a virus” is pretty much exactly what the bye bye man is. So they're ripping off a rip off. Cool cool."
ySy8mcceTno,BUT WHO WAS PHONE
ySy8mcceTno,SomethingAwful Forums are crying for beating it's precious thing like a dead horse.
ySy8mcceTno,Cool
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait to see this in Wisconsin! I wonder if those two girls will be able to see it too.
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,I remember playing this game. I loved it so much! The nostalgia...
ySy8mcceTno,I want a tici Toby movie he is my fav
ySy8mcceTno,"So there is a slender man movie, which was supposed to be 5 years old by now, but there is no fnaf movie, which its games are still being made?"
ySy8mcceTno,What's with all the Ring imagery?
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like it might be a decent psychological thriller. 
If it's PG-13, it'll suck. 
Rated R, it'll have a chance."
ySy8mcceTno,This brings me back to my edgy days.
ySy8mcceTno,fucking lol
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't suck.
ySy8mcceTno,Guys are really fucking late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the creepy pasta movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Nope! Nope! Nope! Nope! Nope! Nope! Nope! Nope! I am not watching this! I was already sad when that girl killed herself😵😱😰
ySy8mcceTno,StickMAN
ySy8mcceTno,You’re kidding right?
ySy8mcceTno,Jack Slenderman!
ySy8mcceTno,Não entendi muito bem esse trailer .. Mais ta valendo kkkk
ySy8mcceTno,Suicide forest 🤬
ySy8mcceTno,Woow ya quiero verla

ySy8mcceTno,"Concete Giraffes.
Little Kuriboh lol"
ySy8mcceTno,ALLU AKBAR
ySy8mcceTno,I thought is gonna be Logan Paul running from social media.
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like my eyes might explode....


I'm shook"
ySy8mcceTno,"People saying that the movie is late....




I forgot that you can make a good movie in just 2 months."
ySy8mcceTno,The edgy 13 Yr olds are having a orgasm
ySy8mcceTno,and this is the same company who cancelled the Popeye movie in favor of the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,It is really?
ySy8mcceTno,Muy tarde 5 años tarde capitán lento
ySy8mcceTno,who would wanna see a SCP movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Or you know you could just watch MarbleHornets instead... for free...
ySy8mcceTno,Too late Sony it was trending like 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,No fringing way !
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting fo a outlast movie
ySy8mcceTno,My childhood dream has came true
ySy8mcceTno,This girl is like Will form Stranger Things
ySy8mcceTno,+1 херовый фильм про Слендера
ySy8mcceTno,They're making a movie based on a meme out of all things.
ySy8mcceTno,inb4 it’s trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie idea: slender man vs Jason
I think I just doomed humanity"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm waiting for a Five Nights at Freddy's movie. My guess is it would have almost the same plot as this.
ySy8mcceTno,Good thing they got to this before the trend died out...
ySy8mcceTno,For a second I thought I clicked on a Logan Paul vlog
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"Rly
Making up horror scary character is ok
Stealing one from a fucking creepypasta is sad"
ySy8mcceTno,"As a longtime Creepypasta fan, I've gotta say this looks pretty garbage. We'll have to wait and see, I guess."
ySy8mcceTno,:43 Sony you guys forgot the nsfw Jef the Killer x “Slendy” fan art and the weird fanfics
ySy8mcceTno,Lol this looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Sony do you remember This Is It?
ySy8mcceTno,"There supposed to be 3 they say, lol nah 4eva 2"
ySy8mcceTno,Like most of hollywoods movies based on trends this is 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Fear Mythos Universe? When will they make the movie for Archangel?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought my friends were just screwing around with me when they told me this would be a movie but now im crying tears of both fear and happiness
ySy8mcceTno,Woo!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony should change their name to 
Revival Meme Studios"
ySy8mcceTno,NO WHIPPIN IN THE CLUB GIMME $20 GIMME $20 GIMME $20!!
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things...
ySy8mcceTno,Slander man reminded me of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,"Uh...You are a little late there, friends. XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Bye bye man vs slender man
ySy8mcceTno,I doutgt it
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer made no sense
ySy8mcceTno,*Oke*
ySy8mcceTno,A movie based on a creepypasta... This will be interesting.
ySy8mcceTno,🤦‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,Sony?...hahahaha😂👌
ySy8mcceTno,Oooo... Sorry sony you're... *looks at watch* 5 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, I am a fan of creepypasta myself, So this is gonna be good"
ySy8mcceTno,Scp movie plis :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Now I'm just waiting for a fnaf movie, Minecraft movie, and pubg movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Feel old yet?
ySy8mcceTno,for some reason i thought it said Spider-Man
ySy8mcceTno,Stop
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, the SCP series would be a better fit."
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone else see him in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,WTF...
ySy8mcceTno,Well that was boring
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,They should have released this movie a while back and it would have done better
ySy8mcceTno,I hope his proxies are with him
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't get the backlash about why it's bad, it's not even out yet"
ySy8mcceTno,10 years too late but ok ill roll with it
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice 
Slender always deserved to be in a movie 
This will either be amazing or will fail miserably"
ySy8mcceTno,2 girls stab the friend 12 time...
ySy8mcceTno,"2019: 
      SpongeBob: 
Squidward's Suicide
     THE MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta incoming
ySy8mcceTno,This is dumb and unnecessary. Cynical Sony trying to make a quick cash grab with a total lack of concern for the story and what looks to be one the lowest of film-making efforts possible. Pathetic...
ySy8mcceTno,"Who knows? It could be really good, and it could even revive creepypastas to the new generation of yourh. Yeah, it could be bad, but we should stay positive until we see it."
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,"We, as the internet community, did not consent to this being made. At all."
ySy8mcceTno,WHAT
ySy8mcceTno,"Your about 6 years to late 
Jk I know it takes a long time to make a movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Please no this is bringing me back to a time i had once please.
ySy8mcceTno,Fucking trash predictable dissapointment
ySy8mcceTno,"Cant wait for the Jeff The Killer movie am i right?





Okay ill leave now."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is BACK
ySy8mcceTno,How are you gonna make a slender man movie but not an SCP movie
ySy8mcceTno,When?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man? Solo falta jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,No way. No freakin way
ySy8mcceTno,Ohh boy!!1 Next Year is Herobrine and 2020 is Leeroy Jenkins - The Legend!! On point just like Internet explorer Sony!
ySy8mcceTno,A little late to the Slenderman hype train aren't they? Like 6 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,So hyped!!!
ySy8mcceTno,r they cereal?
ySy8mcceTno,"Hear me or here, guys. I think Sony might be a little, listen to me now. I think they might be maybe 6 years late with this one"
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like The Rake would atleast be a 4.2 🌟. But this, an actual trailer of one of my favorite creepypastas...


My dreams are coming true"
ySy8mcceTno,Well its about time.
ySy8mcceTno,"I am not surprised that Sony is incompetent enough to jump on the Slenderman trend, even though it has been dead for four years..."
ySy8mcceTno,This better be legit
ySy8mcceTno,NUU Mr Widemouth movie!
ySy8mcceTno,i thought screen gems died off well im stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Took'em long enough
ySy8mcceTno,"Starring:




Logan Paul"
ySy8mcceTno,Although I am interested in seeing this the trailer looks like it's gonna be completely different from the actual story wich I hope I'm wrong but still something worth at least giving a shot at
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,😯😨😶💀
ySy8mcceTno,My kids will love this movie! Btw there 5
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they make a movie
ySy8mcceTno,When will Hollywood learn that using games and outdated stuff to make movies ISN'T ALWAYS a good idea?
ySy8mcceTno,"""The Emoji Movie"" has a more interesting trailer than this"
ySy8mcceTno,Only a few years late
ySy8mcceTno,"I really don't see how any of these events in the trailer connect to one another, much less to Slender Man. If the movie is going to change up the lore and add some original material, that's fine, but the trailer is supposed to be a representation of the film itself and this trailer looks confusing as all hell. Nothing makes sense and there's no context to explain it. Sony's already gonna have a problem with building up hype for a character that hasn't been popular for years, and this trailer is not helping in the least."
ySy8mcceTno,He's gonna only be in for like 5 fukin min as some kind of shitty illusion
ySy8mcceTno,0:03 Roll Credits!
ySy8mcceTno,NO NO NO GUYS DON'T HATE I LOVE SLENDERMAN AND RLY HOPE FOR THEN TO MAKE THIS A REAL MOVIE

ySy8mcceTno,Super confused
ySy8mcceTno,cagenla gagenla cabrones
ySy8mcceTno,I hope DashieXP is voicing Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought it said Spider-Man when I clicked on the trailer, watched it with my  5 year old brother"
ySy8mcceTno,The meme of 2012 is back
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,WHITE PEOPLE AND THE RING........... add Donald Trump and THEN IT WILL BE SCARY!
ySy8mcceTno,Yeeeeees
ySy8mcceTno,Every white little girl be the victim not black or asain always white
ySy8mcceTno,"FNaF movie, slender man movie, where’s the herobrine movie at?"
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t know what it has to do with slender
ySy8mcceTno,I am gonna be honest this looks good I am gonna watch this when it comes out wow
ySy8mcceTno,The emoji movie was better
ySy8mcceTno,Lit
ySy8mcceTno,Its meant for kids & grownups who gets easily scared :(
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer deserves every dislike it gets. Come on, Slender man hasn’t been a thing since 2010"
ySy8mcceTno,Spooky
ySy8mcceTno,YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"To me, the movie might be a little bit cheesy.😕😐"
ySy8mcceTno,Brandon Ingram?
ySy8mcceTno,alfin alv sacan esta pelicula que y es oficial :v
ySy8mcceTno,I thought that they weren't going to make this movie because of that girl getting stabbed by her friends because they were sacrificing her to slender man?!
ySy8mcceTno,wooow...ive been craving for slenderman movie to be real....XDDDD for freaking yrs
ySy8mcceTno,"if the creepypasta fandom re-emerges from the ashes of hell due to this movie, i’m going to do a backflip off the st. louis arch"
ySy8mcceTno,"Never closed Pornhub so fast!

EDIT: Never reopened Pornhub so fast!"
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora solo falta una de jeff the killer :v
ySy8mcceTno,looks like fan made
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm gonna tell everyone at my house ""This creepy pasta has a movie."""
ySy8mcceTno,yeah I'm sure the girl who got stabbed like 19 times by her friends in the woods by her friends because they said slender man made them I bet that little girl who almost lost her life would love this movie.....
ySy8mcceTno,ladies and gents this is how you know 2018 will be a bad year
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FAKE TRAILER I’M SO HAPPY. HE’S 1 OF MY FAVORITE CREEPYPASTAS
ySy8mcceTno,boring trailer....👎
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Looks cool but...  Your both too late AND too early
ySy8mcceTno,It hardly showed slender man at all!
ySy8mcceTno,TBH looks pretty shitty
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, why slender is not in the fucking trailer of his own movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,Me Gusta
ySy8mcceTno,Seems legit
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was dead lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony better go bankrupt if this movie isn’t good. Slender man was mine and many other horror fans favorite creepypasta and I still love it today and an amazing video game (at the time, 2012) was made for him, they better give this legend and his fans a great movie."
ySy8mcceTno,YOU CAN'T SEE ME
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,"YES, YES, YES, YES!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,❤❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,Pimba
ySy8mcceTno,Actually from the area where the attempted murder for Slender Man happened... so HAHA THANKS but pass.
ySy8mcceTno,"Chama la verda no entendi, el trailer tiene más cosas tétricas y bizarras que el propio slenderman pero debo de admitir que me gustó"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not sure I can accept this after the Emoji Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"What if Hollywood isn't actually running out of ideias, but we, viewers, are running out of interest in new ideias?"
ySy8mcceTno,Hell To The Yes Been Waiting Since 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m hoping we rarely see him in the movie, that’s what I think could really make this movie great."
ySy8mcceTno,did she just stab herself in the eye wtf girl what u doin
ySy8mcceTno,"You know, I had an idea to make a found footage horror film based on Slender Man. I don't think I have that chance anymore. :("
ySy8mcceTno,Could of done a different name tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Someone already did this sorry Sony. I mean they were going to name it slender man but then it got copyrighted. If you wanna watch it it’s called Always Watching a Marble Hornets Story
ySy8mcceTno,anyone else disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,another m18 movie I won't be watching :<
ySy8mcceTno,Another boring scary movie
ySy8mcceTno,K
ySy8mcceTno,"I really hope this is good, for the sake of the Marble Hornets/CreepyPasta community! And myself lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Hoping for the navy seal copy-pasta to be made into a blockbuster action film.
ySy8mcceTno,*insert static screen sound*
ySy8mcceTno,"1:39

ySy8mcceTno,"Another creepy pasta pg13 jumpscare reliable movie, great"
ySy8mcceTno,sony's next movie Jeff The Killer-Total Retribution-Official trailer(HD)
ySy8mcceTno,"It's awesome how they dont put slender everywhere, they're representing how he effects his victims, and takes when the time comes"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the real slender man from the creepy pasta story and game franchise???
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, this movie would make a lot more money if it came out 6 years ago."
ySy8mcceTno,marblehornets did a better job with slender man then this lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh this won't even be scary because Slender Man is a relevant
ySy8mcceTno,Well at least this is better than truth or dare but I think they spoiled it too much and It seemed boring and it did not really talk about the characters at all
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer better be next
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wow
ySy8mcceTno,Why do you have to ruin everything Sony
ySy8mcceTno,:000❤
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta cinematic universe starts
ySy8mcceTno,"From the internet phenomenon and video game now Slender Man will hit theaters!!!, I just don't understand all the hate in the comments give the movie a chance at least , it's looks really cool in my opinion!"
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for the part where obnoxious lets players scream into their microphones for views.
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah but like how many pages did she get first?
ySy8mcceTno,#Revive
ySy8mcceTno,Welp...
ySy8mcceTno,9 year olds that so badly wanted a slender man movie are literally gonna have a heart attack watching this
ySy8mcceTno,When did they decide that they were gonna make this I mean this shit's old
ySy8mcceTno,DEFINITELY not like the game but...ok
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, topical..."
ySy8mcceTno,No lo c rick parace falso
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? Jeff the Killer? Sonic.EXE?
ySy8mcceTno,Why it's not 2007 any more
ySy8mcceTno,The legend returns :O
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing scary about this movie is how bad it's going to be. But at least it's original right?
ySy8mcceTno,Sounds like a fluke
ySy8mcceTno,i think this might be the second slender man movie there was i saw called always watch a marble hornet story it was another found footage film but it was rather good the only way the people in the movie could see the slender man was by lookin through the video camera if they look at where the slender man without the camera they would only see what was around the slender man they would the slender man they would have to look at whatever spot the slender man was standing at through the camera in order to see him that's what mad this movie so scary
ySy8mcceTno,2012 mando abraços
ySy8mcceTno,this is still a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,Few years to late sony
ySy8mcceTno,film is  very xạo lòn
ySy8mcceTno,If they making a movie on SlenderMan they have to make a movie on Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,I'd rather have a Doki Doki movie. It would still probably be bad but It would be incredible compared to this crap.
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t suck.... please
ySy8mcceTno,Mi niño rata interno crepipastero quiere ver esto :v
ySy8mcceTno,the most anticipated movie of the year         2012 😂
ySy8mcceTno,This looks cool
ySy8mcceTno,People still recovering from emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Yay finaly Slendey is back
ySy8mcceTno,This is 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"I see more likes than the average Sony Movie, something is going wrong"
ySy8mcceTno,Only took them 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,God is this gonna be just a bunch 'creepiness' or images/scenes that try to be creepy but never succeeds to be an actual horror movie with no horror and no scares. Basically a tease? Like The Witch?
ySy8mcceTno,WTF this scary as shiii
ySy8mcceTno,WTF DID I JUST WATCH ?
ySy8mcceTno,Ya I didn’t wanna sleep anyway tonight
ySy8mcceTno,I reacted to this incredibly flawed trailer on my channel youtu.be/e-4srd5thC4
ySy8mcceTno,La película de un juego echo en unity
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for Smiley Dog movie 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,LOL Slenderman movie nice m8s
ySy8mcceTno,Bit late for a movie
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrifying
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good...for a 10 minute fan created short. About 5 years late with this one Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow es un sueño despiertenme
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell? I don't know how to feel about this
ySy8mcceTno,Their making video games into movies now.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I CANT WAIT.....for this movie to flop
ySy8mcceTno,Ojala y salga luego
ySy8mcceTno,At least it isn't another freaking reboot
ySy8mcceTno,This new Spider-Man movie looks sick.
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait for the herobrine movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I see... a little inspiration from the rong...
ySy8mcceTno,"As a fan of creepypasta and someone whose favorite is Slenderman, i'm just... not feeling this movie. It looks cheesy and like slenderman will only actually appear in like, 3 minutes of it. The rest would be boring dialouge. If you want something actually GOOD and slenderman inspired, watch Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,When is soon
ySy8mcceTno,So it’s a movie about a bunch of psychologically screwed up kids? How original.🙄
ySy8mcceTno,Why are people hating
ySy8mcceTno,This isn’t fake right
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is a lot like the ring just learning from the trailer alone. I am going to s!!it myself
ySy8mcceTno,Thought this was Spider-Man.
ySy8mcceTno,its going to be one of those movies where they have like only 3 mins of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Happy new year ✌🍾guys... 👍👍👍😊
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late bud
ySy8mcceTno,They made him look gay
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol k do The enderman next.




Your out of ideas big boi"
ySy8mcceTno,ok... I guess
ySy8mcceTno,now this is the legit trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean, at least it’s a better name than the bye bye man"
ySy8mcceTno,"First the Emoji Movie, now this? They're running out of ideas"
ySy8mcceTno,They had the opportunity to make Slenderman horrifying and this but I think they really dropped the ball they could have made his face horrifying your nightmare fuel but alas I don't think it's going to be that scary
ySy8mcceTno,Meanwhile ex creepypasta fans are getting Vietnam  flashbacks of their edgy life styles while also cringing
ySy8mcceTno,we need a movie about jeff now
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus, everyone is so negative about this. I get that it is an old thing but seriously, give this movie a chance! Most of the comments I've seen have been comparing this to other movies that were bad but you haven't even seen this one yet. I don't think you should compare this to a released movie until this comes out and you've seen it yourself."
ySy8mcceTno,looks like a Marilyn manson video with jumpscares. Theyre are better creepypastas online to write about. If they don't make a 1999 movie I'm gonna be disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,God dammit.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Yes.
ySy8mcceTno,great sony
ySy8mcceTno,"Ohh si, esperó este muy emocionante"
ySy8mcceTno,2:21 pause here and show too your 10 year old cousin
ySy8mcceTno,Herobrine movie when
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks awesome
ySy8mcceTno,All 25k of u are not special or beautiful unique snowflakes your the all singing all dancing crap of the world
ySy8mcceTno,"Cheesy lame or not I'll probably go watch it in the theater, and bring the nephews because they scare easily"
ySy8mcceTno,It started with a low quality game Bruh than this?
ySy8mcceTno,Go home Sony you're drunk.
ySy8mcceTno,Where is toby
ySy8mcceTno,At least it's gonna be more like the creepypasta than the tall man was
ySy8mcceTno,Please take a hint from Marvel and make a cinematic universe of creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,People a trying to stop this movie from happening because of the slender man stabbing and i'm sorry but that's stupid this movie does not even have the similarities to said incident.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh ok
ySy8mcceTno,Next it will be Five Nights at Freddy's.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like one of the worst horror movies that will ever be made
ySy8mcceTno,This is relevant still?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my fucking god I’ve waited 6 years for this and it’s out
ySy8mcceTno,Uh no thanks doesn't look that good
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, a horror movie I can look forward to seeing"
ySy8mcceTno,They keep making slenderman movies but its not about fucking slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,They better give slendy a lot of screen time or I ain’t watching this. I wonder what would happen if they made on based off of all the SCPs......
ySy8mcceTno,Nada que ver con la historia original😑😒
ySy8mcceTno,En serio
ySy8mcceTno,More like venom wannabe
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow es el creepypasta que mas alta ah llegado, el tráiler es una porquería, espero con ansias la Película de Jeff The Killer que esa historia es aun mas interesante"
ySy8mcceTno,tried too hard to be edgy
ySy8mcceTno,Boi
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, Frick."
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy wants his 20$
ySy8mcceTno,tad bit late
ySy8mcceTno,Seems to be exploiting the murder case to me.
ySy8mcceTno,"Seriously, is this for real. I want to see this, and other creepypasta characters as movies."
ySy8mcceTno,Worst trailer of all time
ySy8mcceTno,"A bit late, don't you think?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man is cool and all my bro, cousin and I were really into him when we were little but... what about the Rake?"
ySy8mcceTno,"couple of years late, but ok, whatever"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow... I did not know Sony could get this low in the movie making pile of future bs. This is going to be AMAZING
ySy8mcceTno,"God, I can’t stand teenagers."
ySy8mcceTno,lol k
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of the weird movie Jared showed the office where he's just filming Stanley in his car.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a legit movie trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,oh shoot
ySy8mcceTno,This looks horrible 😂
ySy8mcceTno,0:48 scared me so much oml
ySy8mcceTno,oh wait this is real?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it was made by a parody YouTube maker it's crap and Slenderman doesn't look like he does in the game
ySy8mcceTno,He's back.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow... Just wow, somehow you took a scary character who was unlike anything Hollywood was making and not only boil him down into boring Hollywood schlock. You guys also found a 13 year old neck deep in their emo phase to write and direct. You couldn't even get one that wanted to, every shot in this trailer looks like an amateur who hates the project they are working on made it.

'hey that smoke effect isn't done it looks bad. We should fix that' nah, it's fine no one cares it looks like someone drew on the film with a sharpie.

'hey I found another stabbing sound effects that sounds much grosser and horrific, and it was free online' yeah, but that sounds like work and I would rather not do that.

'hey I've been doing research and it turns out Slenderman never moves when being observed so maybe we could edit around all these scenes when he is doing that.' it's fine, already shipped the movie.

I would say Sony should stick to gaming but the only reason they are doing good there is because Microsoft is screwing up worse.

EDIT: oh my god, I just looked it up, according to Wikipedia they litteraly shot this in a month."
ySy8mcceTno,Were is hero brine
ySy8mcceTno,was that Sally at the end
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t know how I think it’s going to turn out, hopefully it has a sensical plot and good kills"
ySy8mcceTno,totally related
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s slender man
ySy8mcceTno,marble hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,A little late to be making this movie
ySy8mcceTno,WOW REALLY!!!Another movie about a dead trend.Just fills my soul with joy.
ySy8mcceTno,"1:34 Lady, no suiciding in class. It's a school rule."
ySy8mcceTno,It would've probably...maybe been better if Blum house productions made it...
ySy8mcceTno,Cool concept but it seams terrible
ySy8mcceTno,I don't feel the original slendy
ySy8mcceTno,lol wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Tf
ySy8mcceTno,They better be making a buzzfeed unsolved movie after this
ySy8mcceTno,The word original doesn’t spring to mind.
ySy8mcceTno,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn.
ySy8mcceTno,Wait what
ySy8mcceTno,"What next, getting over it w/ Bennet Foddy?"
ySy8mcceTno,Spoiler alert. Any movie based on a video game is always a terrible movie
ySy8mcceTno,i dont remember this episode of naruto and iv watched the whole series???
ySy8mcceTno,Why is it that every movie based on something popular from the internet comes out way too far after its relevancy?
ySy8mcceTno,This is just gonna ruin slender for me
ySy8mcceTno,Why slender man movie I'm terrified...
ySy8mcceTno,"¿Y si sacan una buena película de Assassin's Creed? Una relacionada con la historia, no con la basura que vimos en el cine 😐😐😐"
ySy8mcceTno,A la verga quiero ver en el 2019 la película de Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,oh boy now I don't have to wait for season 3 of Channel Zero. Instead I get....this thing
ySy8mcceTno,Get ready for the fnaf movie next
ySy8mcceTno,So what does this have to do with slenderman? I can understand the psychotic breakdowns and stuff as a part of slender sickness but this is just overly edgy stuff. If I were you I'd watch marble hornets instead.
ySy8mcceTno,"...you do know that the reason people are going to watch this movie is to SEE Slenderman, right? Cut out all that bullshit with the maggots, and the needles, and stuff. Give us more of the title character!"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh
ySy8mcceTno,"Finalmente fizeram o filme. Não é mito, nem folclore ou lenda urbana. É um E.T.E. em forma de capeta."
ySy8mcceTno,WHEN I SAW THAT SONY MADE IT I SAID SLENDER MAN KILL ME KNOW
ySy8mcceTno,This is thing . Y just y ?
ySy8mcceTno,So they are going the abstract route like the Ring
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the Squidward's Suicide movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man coming half a decade too late
ySy8mcceTno,So they actually did it. They made a movie from a post off /x/
ySy8mcceTno,When you know the cinema world is dying
ySy8mcceTno,i'll shot myself
ySy8mcceTno,What is this??? This ain't slender man This is nothing Sony Seriously This Trailer Sucks Should I really call this a Slender man movie There was bailey any Slendy no I can't say this is gonna be good!
ySy8mcceTno,ill like to know how he has time to find a suit if he too busy scaring people
ySy8mcceTno,Where the Creepypasta fam at?
ySy8mcceTno,R u sure this is real or this is just bs
ySy8mcceTno,"So you're making a horror movie based of a horror game, and removing everything that made the game scary? Can't wait to see what could've been an actually scary movie be terrible... Gg Sony gg"
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this #5 on trending? It’s gonna be trash.
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like even The Bye Bye Man would be better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,Have fun creepy pasta lovers
ySy8mcceTno,Nolose riki parese falso
ySy8mcceTno,cagala y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"The story itself wasn't that bad,as long as you read just that story then Slenderman is a fine character"
ySy8mcceTno,Just six years late to the party.
ySy8mcceTno,ya quieroo verla carnal va a estar esa peliculaaa una mantequita
ySy8mcceTno,Didnt someone already try to make slender man into a movie? I feel like thats s thing.
ySy8mcceTno,"What a time for a damned CreepyPasta movie,only hopes our:be better than that awful Always Watching movie"
ySy8mcceTno,I mean after the slender man stabbing are you sure you guys wanna make a movie about this outdated tentacle hentai manikin
ySy8mcceTno,Ew
ySy8mcceTno,"What ever you do!!




Don’t look back!"
ySy8mcceTno,I loved it
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes! Finally a Slender Man movie, I can't wait, I love Slender Man I always watch documentaries about him and everything this is going to be GOOD!!!👍🤘🏼👏💪🏼"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm actually disappointed in this trailer😐
ySy8mcceTno,Too little to late
ySy8mcceTno,dont like it :v
ySy8mcceTno,*BEST*
ySy8mcceTno,Ghey
ySy8mcceTno,"plot: girl and her friend(s) gets really into slender man creepy pasta and then cant tell whats real and whats not, she kills someone and is eventually caught."
ySy8mcceTno,about time
ySy8mcceTno,lol lol
ySy8mcceTno,cant wait for a hour of a girl running through the woods and in classrooms just to see that they completely changed slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m confused.
ySy8mcceTno,The 2009 slender man is back and wants to be popular again
ySy8mcceTno,What took so long? Sony? I need answers
ySy8mcceTno,We just want the Popeyes movie back.
ySy8mcceTno,only 10 years behind
ySy8mcceTno,You guys aren't 5 years late or anything...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man coming in May? I dont know
ySy8mcceTno,"Looking at people in the comments talk about a Creepypasta cinematic universe 
*STOP GIVING SONY IDEAS*"
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time!!
ySy8mcceTno,wtf dude
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been cool if it were made in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"Alright guys. Can we finally do it right this time? You know, actually show him in the movie and make it good this time? The last Slender man movie REALLY pissed me off tbh."
ySy8mcceTno,**counts how many years since slender man was popular**
ySy8mcceTno,ok this gonna be bull crap this change my whole perspective of slendy in a bad way
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji Movie>Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,To com um cagaço de ver esse filme
ySy8mcceTno,This should be a scary movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Excluding the Sony part, does anyone else get a vibe of the Bye Bye Man from this?"
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next the emoji movie? Hahah.....oh wait
ySy8mcceTno,Colleague wire cry alleged medium injury check no.
ySy8mcceTno,lol wut. leave 2012 where it is.

ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how it be with smile.exe
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony... you need to learn from all your bad movies, you have a lot and this is one of them"
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see it in 3D
ySy8mcceTno,Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh wow, the most anticipated film of 2013."
ySy8mcceTno,It took 8 years to finally make this. This better be good
ySy8mcceTno,I ♥ crepypastas

ySy8mcceTno,"1:31
Like we haven't heard of middle schoolers committing suicide before."
ySy8mcceTno,wtf???
ySy8mcceTno,"Well is it really a terribly unexciting, nonsensical, uninspired, uncreative movie that collapsed under the potential it had for amazing content of an incredible concept... or just a terribly unexciting, nonsensical, uninspired, uncreative trailer which fails to portray the potential the movie has for amazing content of an incredible concept?  Or is it both?  Only time will tell!"
ySy8mcceTno,shitty af
ySy8mcceTno,"I think its based on the news 2 years ago (i think) about 2 girls who stabs their 1 friend because slenderman told them to do it, you can find it on youtube"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG :O
ySy8mcceTno,I need to see this i want yo see this i have to see this omg i love this
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not really a Slender Man know it all, uhh.. can someone tell me why this is getting hate? I mean it looks interesting to me, and the way I see it, we haven't even seen the actual movie yet. You never know, I mean it might actually be pretty good☺."
ySy8mcceTno,When every movie company runs out of ideas...
ySy8mcceTno,3spoopy5me👌
ySy8mcceTno,"1. Why
2. You're late to the party"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is real this is not a dream





I wanna die"
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks trash
Sony, just stop making movies please"
ySy8mcceTno,- Creepypasta Intensifies -
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when slenderman was popular like 5 years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,I know someone mentioned something about wondering their daughter but still I want to hear more
ySy8mcceTno,they should've never made this tbh.
ySy8mcceTno,"According to the trailer, this movie is going to be another piece of crap!"
ySy8mcceTno,"My God, THEY DID IT!"
ySy8mcceTno,PLUS WHY IS NO ONE TALKING?!? CAN I JUST HEAR SOMEONE SAY AT LEAST ONE WORD IN THIS TRAILER LIKE THE ONLY SOUNDS IN THIS TRAILER WAS LITERALLY THE BACKGROUND MUSIC AND SOMEONE SCREAMING!!! I WANT TO HEAR A VOICE OMFGGG LIKE IDK WHY IM SO ANNOYED BY THIS!! BUT IM FREAKING ANNOYED! AT LEAST ONE WORD PLEASE!!!
ySy8mcceTno,The new season of Stranger Things looks great
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh wait...this is actually a real trailer, and not a joke? 
Okay, you got me, guys. Is this that college humor spoof?
NO ITS FUCKING REAL!? LMAO LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
GOTTA BE KIDDING !!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH GOOD LUCK"
ySy8mcceTno,ahora que el creepypasta universe
ySy8mcceTno,"I’ve waited so long for a slender man movie to come out and now it finally will,.. I’m disappointed because it’s not what I expected"
ySy8mcceTno,"I never not wanted something more in my life. And i know, ""no one is forcing me to watch it"" but knowing this exists just pains me"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh... Not as good as expected...
ySy8mcceTno,Go watch marble hornets instead. It's free. It's better. Dont waste your money.
ySy8mcceTno,Dice 2003 que le regresen su personaje :v
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god they made a movie
ySy8mcceTno,i mean... okay
ySy8mcceTno,*Jeff the Killer movie please* 🙏🏻
ySy8mcceTno,😂
ySy8mcceTno,We are going to die
ySy8mcceTno,"Just go watch Owlman, it's based on the legend and will probably be better."
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh
ySy8mcceTno,Looks generic
ySy8mcceTno,this is a real thing?
ySy8mcceTno,no
ySy8mcceTno,"This has no slenderman feel to it. If you wanted to make a good movie, you’d need to at least just stop with all the crappy effects and flashing images and make it original, (aka more blood and gore rather than crap you can make merch off of) also I can’t wait for a Jeff the killer movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"How do you take something so iconic and fundamentally, inherently scary and make it........not scary? I'm almost as impressed as I am disappointed."
ySy8mcceTno,"Ohhhhh
What's next Five Nights at Freedy's 😐"
ySy8mcceTno,"Um, my only answer is Stranger Things, uh anyone else?"

ySy8mcceTno,"Vi muchos comentarios negativos, pero neta yo si la ire a ver"
ySy8mcceTno,holita :v
ySy8mcceTno,"I'll wait for the sequel, Slenderman Verses Jeff the Killer.  Should be a laugh riot."
ySy8mcceTno,Or of it
ySy8mcceTno,Finally there making a movie about him
ySy8mcceTno,are you kidding me?
ySy8mcceTno,YA ERA HORA... TARDARON UN CHINGO :v
ySy8mcceTno,You're seven years late
ySy8mcceTno,We didn’t need this...
ySy8mcceTno,"This is so disappointing. 
Reasons:
No School or Science Lab in Slender Man games

No growling in slender man games

You play as one person 

No Cops in Slenderman 

JESUS SONY"
ySy8mcceTno,remember the Candle Cove TV show?
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,This is still a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,"2:03
Jigsaw and Slenderman forming an alliance called the Double Alliance"
ySy8mcceTno,excited but poorly made trailer
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER THE ARRIVAL COME BACK
ySy8mcceTno,Fala deus no teu santo nome
ySy8mcceTno,L
ySy8mcceTno,Yo.... this actually looks pretty terrifying. However it Doesn't look or feel like the original game. But it seems cooler the way he makes them go crazy and lose their minds.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man the movie but without the slender man





Y U NO GIVE SLENDER MAN A JOB"
ySy8mcceTno,Garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Mfw Sony releases a cool movie but I don't own a PS4 :(
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry Sony, I think you missed this by 6 years."
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMAN Confirmed for Mortal Kombat 11
ySy8mcceTno,Well this looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,Scrolling through the comments so that I don’t poop my pants
ySy8mcceTno,Also they shouldn’t be worried because Wobedy will come to save the day with his superior skill to troll.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol of course
ySy8mcceTno,A biiiiiiit late do doncha think?
ySy8mcceTno,Dross
ySy8mcceTno,6 years
ySy8mcceTno,"i mean it looks like is not going to properly follow the lore behind slender man, but hey! we dont have to give respect to a HUGE part of todays horror culture! right? right?!"
ySy8mcceTno,IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE !!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I don't understand what this movie will be about... :/
ySy8mcceTno,this is real...
ySy8mcceTno,1:53 that was the most predictable jump scare of all time
ySy8mcceTno,"A cabrón...
Esto si me interesa :v"
ySy8mcceTno,Slenditubbies is more better
ySy8mcceTno,Why so late after the game
ySy8mcceTno,yesss more memes
ySy8mcceTno,wow this looks *terrible*
ySy8mcceTno,This movie issa big bust 😬.
ySy8mcceTno,too fucking late for this
ySy8mcceTno,"but, why now?"
ySy8mcceTno,They held this off for 6 years and it’s made by Sony...which is a bad sign but...I’ve been wanting to see a movie based off slender man for awhile so I’m gonna give it a chance.
ySy8mcceTno,cade o som bugado e tradicional no slender
ySy8mcceTno,"I have noticed that I see this so called ""Slender man"" In my dreams.Some of the noises put into the trailer were heard in my dreams and screaming.I've had the dreams since I was a young baby.I still have them to this very day...."
ySy8mcceTno,I HAVE TO WATCH IT! Boss
ySy8mcceTno,Ok and the Slender man is dangerous why exactly?
ySy8mcceTno,Lets pray if this is good.
ySy8mcceTno,The rake would be a better movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is not how slender man works! Why did they change the story
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like this is basically one of those movies where the trailers are better then the actual film..
ySy8mcceTno,"You're seven years late to the Slender party, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,"We hardly even saw Slender Man in this trailer. I know the description says that he is a virus, blah blah blah, gets in your head, but wouldn't you have to see him for that to happen???"
ySy8mcceTno,nope not watching that
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah... I can forsee this being a complete flop at the box office.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh a new meme yay
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the FNaF movie god dammit?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao what’s next a FNAF movie 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,mmm parece cualquier cosa menos slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This should be memeified
ySy8mcceTno,Pedohollywood keeps running out of ideas because they keep forcing political correctness down our throats with their garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,Is slender man even in this movie. Because he has none of the powers that's in the trailer. Slendy doesn't get in your head
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman needs his suit, where's this spooky pimps suit?!"
ySy8mcceTno,"More Hollywood poorly written trash.
I will stick to independent horror movies because at least they have imagination 
Even if they don't have the big budgets."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks trash
ySy8mcceTno,They're about 5 years late on this
ySy8mcceTno,So they are bringing back stuff from 2012 apperantly
ySy8mcceTno,I'm honestly excited for this movie.  Hope it's good.
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,ok.....wut........?
ySy8mcceTno,y
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like a student short film made with a bunch of edits to “scare” the viewers
ySy8mcceTno,OMG OoO
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Is this supposed to be an apology for The Emoji Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Si pos waw
ySy8mcceTno,Hadnt this movie been made before but had a different tittle
ySy8mcceTno,Ya es muy tarde cabrón >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"He gets in your head like a virus!? Who wrote this? That's not scary, or creepy."
ySy8mcceTno,Someone’s always watching me
ySy8mcceTno,Amazing i can't wait for this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,llegas tarde 12 años tarde :v
ySy8mcceTno,"and then in the sequel Slenderman teams up with Jeff The Killer and they both go on some murderous hijinx,only to find out it all took place in a haunted copy of Sonic The Hedgehog"
ySy8mcceTno,LoL Slender man ugly.
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Eu espero que não caguem
ySy8mcceTno,Ohooo yeah ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my God and  what the hell was that that's it is that it seriously seriously you're holyrood Poliwhirl producers everybody hold on to your seat it's coming soon oh boy that wasn't even scary only if you have the volume up I'd like Five Nights at Freddy's it's not even scary if you don't have the volume up I know you know but I still to the volume down
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man was a thing in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not exided
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow they finally remembered about this after they announced it 3 years ago also really they could not have made this 3 or 4 years ago when slender man was popular, last year he was beaten to death by the fan girls"
ySy8mcceTno,5 years on YouTube... 2nd video to *ever* get a dislike from me
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late to the party don’t ya say
ySy8mcceTno,This is lit but what’s the plot?
ySy8mcceTno,movie of jeff the killer now
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,"First off, didn’t see slender man once. Second of all, thirteen reasons why, they’re coming for your brand. 3rd of all, um just stop trying"
ySy8mcceTno,"soiled it 
soiled it 
soiled it"
ySy8mcceTno,"so is there the proxies?
Slanderman?
Ticci toby?
Masky?
Hoodie?"
ySy8mcceTno,The screen is supposed to be static when he catches you duh...
ySy8mcceTno,De faq is going on?
ySy8mcceTno,"Welcome back slenderman 

Slenderman: i'm waiting sinse 2009"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow garbage lmao
ySy8mcceTno,omg yes
ySy8mcceTno,Dont make movies about 2012 plz
ySy8mcceTno,I did not understand anything kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
ySy8mcceTno,ew
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is terrible honestly what is this?
ySy8mcceTno,Why can't studios keep up with the time? Slender Man does out so long ago and they decided to make a movie. 🤔🙃
ySy8mcceTno,"Can´t you see me = Jhon Cena...!!! and, why alwas worms?????"
ySy8mcceTno,"A bit too late, Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,no stop
ySy8mcceTno,creepy pasta in to a movie how dose that work what is next eyeless jack ir jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Hope you know what you're getting into Sony....good luck
ySy8mcceTno,"It's mr daddy long boy, with the chicken leg arms"
ySy8mcceTno,dont look back.....
ySy8mcceTno,😂
ySy8mcceTno,An ms pain image on something awful spawned this
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like a crappy youtube red movie
ySy8mcceTno,Few years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Sould of made an Enderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,*WTF*
ySy8mcceTno,"Hopefully it's good not like the other 2017 movies which were trash like the ""Emoji Movie"""
ySy8mcceTno,Im still waiting for that FNAF movie
ySy8mcceTno,"The most generic horror trailer ever: Shot in an unsaturated color edit, one scene goes quiet then girl screams and music kicks in, sees monster turns alway then turns around and it’s closer, trailer ends with weird “cliffhanger”."
ySy8mcceTno,Hi
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this actually turns out well and not garbage
ySy8mcceTno,get ready for the screaming emo tumblr girls
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,I really want to watch it who else does.
ySy8mcceTno,Mmm look at that epic grayscale filter over the whole movie. Such a sore for the eyes.
ySy8mcceTno,No why
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be scary
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,about time they made a slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man doesnt posses tho
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman is about subtlety not cliche horror tropes, this isn't a psychological thriller, its your run of the mill generic spooky movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Its a sony film 😑
ySy8mcceTno,why make a movie about a game thats literally about looking for pages in a  forest and trying to not look at something
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who has been waiting for this?
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years after it was hip, huh"
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years too late with this one, Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so confused this isn’t what I expected. This is honestly just showing a bunch of kids  killing themselves (I know it’s bad). It doesn’t show nor represent things about slender man. I mean great job with the trailer and all but I’m gonna stay over her and keep playing the game
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"This was nothing that slender man ever was, there shouldn’t be a huge story, it should be a POV found footage style movie, personally that would be much better"
ySy8mcceTno,"Pelos poderes do bolsonaro, eu invoco os BRS"
ySy8mcceTno,That’s out of the blue.
ySy8mcceTno,*G A Y*
ySy8mcceTno,"2020.
Wojak: One mans story of a terrible brain disability. 4 oscars."
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah, yes, the...Slender Man movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good😂
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn’t even look like it’s about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Based on this video,I'm pretty sure this movie is going to be trash...."
ySy8mcceTno,In 5 years we're going to get *PUBG: The Movie*
ySy8mcceTno,Alright time to go back to my video games
ySy8mcceTno,What the cringe
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman should be psychological horror with a mix of Lovecraft not these shitty jumps cares.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man get his first movie
ySy8mcceTno,found a dead person in the suicide forest
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 dunno why it’s made me laugh at day girls face
ySy8mcceTno,Sony we love you but if this go's down like the emoji move people in the creepy pasta community (and some other people) are going to hate you so please make this good. Im sorry
ySy8mcceTno,BETTER TAN THE EMOJI MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,This NEED To be a NICE FILM
ySy8mcceTno,I wont be surprised if in 2 years i see in my YT Not. Box *HEROBRINE - OFFICAL TRAILER*
ySy8mcceTno,Lol ok
ySy8mcceTno,Main character should be Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,"Mmmm... no se ve buena la pelicula, el nombre es lo único que resalta"
ySy8mcceTno,That moment when you where really excited for a mystery and a good dipiction of slenderman and then you realize you can't watch this because it's just straight gore and nothing else
ySy8mcceTno,lol que fino
ySy8mcceTno,"I have a feeling this is not gonna revolve around slenderman
More of the kids finding him idk it's probably not gonna be worth it"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey remember the 8 pages? Wait...     shouldn't the movie be about that instead of a bunch of random idiots killing themselves?(btw I know they said it was slender)
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so scared lol jk

ySy8mcceTno,Well... This is gonna be a bad movie
ySy8mcceTno,this looks bootleg
ySy8mcceTno,cagala cabron y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,How much u want to bet slenderman is only gonna appear in like 3 scenes
ySy8mcceTno,This is definitely gonna suck. What genre is this because its definitely not horror
ySy8mcceTno,Either the video game has made me immune or this isn't scary at all...
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this new horror game is so scary it’s called slender man .... 8 years later.... Sony: you know that one game that became popular 8 years ago? Employee: ya? Sony:We should make a movie on it but if you don’t read the title of the movie you will have no clue it’s about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Lol.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ooh what if this is creepypasta universe and at the end of this it shows some kid getting bullied, another kid rushes the bullies away, asking ""are you okay Jeff?"" and the bullied kid turns his head to look at the screen and boom, end.
Imagine the edge, it'd be so bad but so cartoony I'd have to see"
ySy8mcceTno,That and there will be more than one trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Next thing they'll make is a creepypasta cinematic universe.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya never know, this might partially also be about the stabbing."
ySy8mcceTno,"Walked in the woods, found a dead person in the suicide forest"
ySy8mcceTno,"So let me get this straight, you waited five years until he finally became the lamest creepypasta and then make a movie after you have already made Emoji Movie....Why, just why..Knowing Sony you will probably make him kill you with fidget spinner and dabbing on you. For the three seconds that he is actually in the movie that is."
ySy8mcceTno,wow
ySy8mcceTno,Esto tiene aire de apestar
ySy8mcceTno,An scp movie would have been better
ySy8mcceTno,"Unpopular opinion, but I would actually like to see this. Besides, not EVERY movie made by Sony has been bad. Yeah, the Emoji Movie was bad. And sure, Creepypasta was a thing of the past, but at least give it a chance. It might not be as bad as you think it's going to be. And which would you rather see: A horror movie about memes, a horror movie about Bendy and the Ink Machine (not ripping the game(I love it to bits)), or a Creepypasta.

I'd much rather see a horror movie about a Creepypasta. Creepypastas has a scary element to them. Especially Slender (refer back to the tragic stabbing.) I think this movie will provide a good amount of jumpscarea, as that is what the Slender games (Slender, Slender: The Eight Pages, Slender: The Nine Pages, Slender: Haunt, Slender: The Arrival, ect.) intend for there to be. People have actually done rituals like this (which thankfully did not succeed,) but it gave them a good scare. Which is what Creepypastas were made to do. Like Slender, Jeff the Killer, Ben Drowned, Hobo Hearts, Puppeteer, The Art of Jacob Emory, ect. So I would at least give this movie a chance. I can't wait until its release date 😁"
ySy8mcceTno,what is this 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Apay kasla cheap ti langa na detoy?
ySy8mcceTno,Netfliiiiiiiix
ySy8mcceTno,STOP GOOD MAN YOU ALMOST GOT THE CHEESE TOUCH
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a Slenderman movie with a real budget
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this movie just like 6 years late at this point?
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't get it the storyline.
Why doesn't it just show the game verision of it but with a woman trying to find the tapes. Instead of all this. P.S. not hating just confused???"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not caught up on my slenderman knowledge, but I'm pretty sure that he's not a mental virus thing"
ySy8mcceTno,1:30 When someone toucha ya *SPAGHET*
ySy8mcceTno,just when i thought there was no bodies in the woods anymore
ySy8mcceTno,Jump scare central.
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this day would happen
ySy8mcceTno,Please movie Jeff the killer 2020
ySy8mcceTno,"LOL, Slender Man was never scary to me but this makes the whole thing seem like a straight-up joke 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,"One question 




Will they show any reference to masky, hoody, toby or kate?"
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks pretty cheesy, and it definitely seems to take some serious visual inspiration from ""The Ring."""
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer didn't even show Slender Man. Hope this isn't a major disappointment, though I'm sure it will. Let's wait and see."
ySy8mcceTno,The American ghoul is coming...
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting for the announcement of a five nights at Freddie’s film after this
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood is running out of ideas if they are relying on people from the internet
ySy8mcceTno,Yes I have been waiting for this! Gonna be better than that stupid IT 2017
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman it's a girl?
ySy8mcceTno,This real!!?
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't even bother with new movies, they all suck."
ySy8mcceTno,This would’ve been a great movie 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,I want a Jeff the Killer movie tbh XD
ySy8mcceTno,😨😨😨
ySy8mcceTno,Ok then
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like the new ""It"""
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there's good actors and that they go by the story though and possibly include some other famous creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,from the makers of the masterpiece known as the emoji movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This look more like an adaptation of one of Junji Ito book than a slender man film.
ySy8mcceTno,7 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,This looks fun
ySy8mcceTno,Next thing you know there’s going to be an scp movie
ySy8mcceTno,I have NO idea how to feel about this
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderdouche
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait for the jeff the killer and the harlem shake movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"Remember when that little girl got stabbed?


Me neither"
ySy8mcceTno,Eeeettttaaaaaa pooohhhhhaaa tá saindo da jaula o monstro
ySy8mcceTno,This is honestly bullshit like did you guys even research about him I don't feel the same horror as the original Slenderman lore
ySy8mcceTno,"Ahora quiero mi Slenderman vs Fredy, depués Slendeman vs Jeff de killer, luego Slenderman vs Adrián Barba, esas son mis exigencias"
ySy8mcceTno,Guess im the only one in comments that liked the trailer lol
ySy8mcceTno,Wait Kate is in this movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Y los loquenderos?
ySy8mcceTno,What a clusterfuck of a trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I thought slender makes the quality horrible
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn't look like slenderman,it looks like the ring 4."
ySy8mcceTno,AFTER THIS TRAILER I AIN'T SCARED OF SLENDER MAN
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is six years late to the party that was already lame
ySy8mcceTno,I love slender man. Can’t wait for this to come out
ySy8mcceTno,"Cadê os brasileiros aqui?e que esse filme seja foda nesse ano de 2018,finalmente um filme do slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,IT CAN'T BE GUY'S IT'S ACTUALLY REAL BECAUSE I SEEN IT ON TV
ySy8mcceTno,Wot
ySy8mcceTno,Aaahm...sure
ySy8mcceTno,Ight whats next jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Bro I thought this hoe said Spider-Man
ySy8mcceTno,Uma bosta
ySy8mcceTno,This is gross I'm sorry but no...
ySy8mcceTno,"If you listen closely, you can hear both the copyright claims, and sony's stock dropping. XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,This isn’t the slender man we all know and love. You should have never made a movie on him.
ySy8mcceTno,Boring!
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be a FLOP
ySy8mcceTno,The Slenderman is Jack Slenderman in Slenderman!! Little Kuriboh's version will obviously be better.
ySy8mcceTno,Featuring gene the emoji
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"its gonna be trash, sony already died when the emoji movie came out"
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally




Oh wait"
ySy8mcceTno,YES CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS #cantseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Will slender man be done correctly in this movie? Wait until the movie comes out to find out.
ySy8mcceTno,O sangue de Jesus tem poder!
ySy8mcceTno,Stop
ySy8mcceTno,Poderia aparecer o Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Pewdie
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm sorry... Why? Just judging off the trailer, it looks terrible. I don't even think there's any serious conversation about Slenderman happening anymore, so who is this targeted to? older creepypasta fans?"
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for Jeff the killer the movie lol
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer is pretty unremarkable when it comes to what Slender Man is or could be.  I'm just seeing a lot of disturbing scenes that don't make much sense, even if it were trying to create some kind of weird child trauma vibe.  Very disappointed."
ySy8mcceTno,"If any movie was going to be filmed with a shaky handheld camera, it should be this."
ySy8mcceTno,About time they make a movie about him!!! Woohoo!
ySy8mcceTno,Sony this is like it the movie but more creeper
ySy8mcceTno,About time they make a movie about him!!! Woohoo!
ySy8mcceTno,I lost faith in horror movies after lights out and the Annabelle film series movies these days arnt the same
ySy8mcceTno,"#canyouseehim? omg I'm gonna die when I see this 
XD"
ySy8mcceTno,"wow, two Venom's movies in this year, i didn't expected it."
ySy8mcceTno,have you not fucking learned a thing after the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"going to be a trash like netflix did to death note, for luck on death note the ""death note' appears 80% of the movie, this slender movie the ""slender' probably will show up 2 or 3 times.
So actually this trailer its about a random kid writing a random thing on a random glass. Wow really scary, This movie gonna be one of that random horror movies what a disgusting things happen in it, like stuff exiting from eyes and ears, unleast its just a theater movie, the netflix make a horrible and idiot movie and put on the ""Why you watched Sherlock"" Thank you marketing"
ySy8mcceTno,well it only took them 5 years to do it
ySy8mcceTno,I’m surprised they’re making a movie about slenderman. Those two girls did almost kill their friend just because of him.
ySy8mcceTno,"A bunch of random scenes that don't make any sense together isn't scary, it's lazy."
ySy8mcceTno,Por dios la espere por tanto tiempo
ySy8mcceTno,I get the feeling the people who made this have never seen Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Did ANYONE involved in this trailer or movie actually researched some facts about the Slender Man mythos? I think not....
ySy8mcceTno,Micheal P
ySy8mcceTno,Omaygusney omaygusney omaygusney
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is made 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Where the hell is the classic slenderman sound, why isn't there any vibe to 2009-2012?? It seems like the cliche stealing people going crazy trope, with a bunch of random climatic scenes and barely any footage of the dude itself. I don't feel the nostalgia that was supposed to be intended, but feel like I'm watching another typical modern day horror movie. I'm also not surprised it was made by Sony Pictures. Like many others I've seen the girls who believed in slenderman who got on the news and everything but what about we actually SEE SLENDERMAN FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW?"
ySy8mcceTno,The game is scarier.
ySy8mcceTno,How can u think 6 years after its popularity is a good time to make a movie
ySy8mcceTno,4 years late Sony! Still might see it though...
ySy8mcceTno,AHHHHHH I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A SLENDERMAN MOVIE FOR YEARS
ySy8mcceTno,**taps foot waiting for cars 4 kerchoo and sanic.exe movies**
ySy8mcceTno,Is Five Nights at Freddie's going to get a live action movie next now 😧
ySy8mcceTno,Um 😐 great👌👌👋👋
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone who is thinking were is slender man in this but all good horror movies dont show the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Oh ffs
ySy8mcceTno,This looks a bit fanmade there
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, a bit too late Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,ooh to spoopy!
ySy8mcceTno,Omg Holy shet
ySy8mcceTno,Aren’t they a few years late for this?
ySy8mcceTno,You can tell it's going to stink.
ySy8mcceTno,next thing you know there’s gonna be a fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,"marble Hornets so far is better for a ""slenderman movie""  it has all the suspense, and mystery needed this dosnt look so good so far..."
ySy8mcceTno,The movie isnt even out and people are already complaining.
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for a Slenderman movie to be made but after this trailer I don't think I'm going to see it. This is not anything like the stories or marble hornets or anything like that. I am very disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this Bye Bye Man 2?
ySy8mcceTno,Berbat trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"“Where is my daughter?? People don’t just disappear”
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN HORROR MOVIES GERALD"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,If pewdiepie isn’t screaming in the background of a chase scene I’d want my money back
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would of been great if it was made in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Id wanted his origins explained
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years to late, don't you think?"
ySy8mcceTno,<3
ySy8mcceTno,"Personally, I think bedtime or Jeff the killer would be a better movie... but that's just me..."
ySy8mcceTno,LOL
ySy8mcceTno,Whats the age rating thing
ySy8mcceTno,REALLY SLENDERMAN GETS HIS OWN MOVIE BUT I DONT!?!?!?!?!?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,where are the notes?
ySy8mcceTno,why tho
ySy8mcceTno,"So many cliches in one trailer. My lord. Yes, good, let’s also show an eye being pierced. What???"
ySy8mcceTno,6/10
ySy8mcceTno,I'll love this movie and I love the game!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh dayum
ySy8mcceTno,"*sees video*
*thinks it’s a trailer for another game*
*clicks*
Wait...is this a movie...
*first 3 seconds and beginning dialogue* 
I AM CONFUSION."
ySy8mcceTno,lol ok
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah I remember the movie Rings as well
ySy8mcceTno,😶 I'm disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol a movie of slender wow good work sony pictures
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t seem to be the kind of slender man the game portrays him as...
ySy8mcceTno,"Having played the original slender, this doesn't seem like the same kind of feeling. In my opinion this doesn't seem like too good of a movie (and no, not because Sony made it)"
ySy8mcceTno,"sony got together and was like ""how about we make a bad adaption of an already good series"" "" yeah thats a really good idea"""
ySy8mcceTno,Considering its 2018 now.... that would make them about 6 years too late right?
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora ha esperar a que salga la película de Jeff The Killer también :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Love how everybody is hating on it and saying it's not the real Slenderman. Do a little research, the guy who wrote the film is Victor Surge.

You know, the guy who invented Slenderman?"
ySy8mcceTno,You’re supposed to feel scared while looking at him. I deadass wanna laugh
ySy8mcceTno,ai meu coraçaozin
ySy8mcceTno,hey sony 4chan just called they want there creepy pasta back
ySy8mcceTno,"what's next, a director's cut with gangnam style? or a jeff the killer movie? i hope to never see this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Que CHI#GE asu madre el America :v
ySy8mcceTno,This is basically a copy of the ring
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like they copied the ring
ySy8mcceTno,Really striking while the irons hot lol
ySy8mcceTno,It'll probably be shite
ySy8mcceTno,12 pesos por un gasito :v
ySy8mcceTno,aWSOME

ySy8mcceTno,this is funny
ySy8mcceTno,Cuánto que la película será un Fracasó en taquilla
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for them to completely ruin slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not sure if this is actually a movie trailer or just another fan-made trailer. I hope this is actually a movie coming out because I always wanted a Slender Man movie.
ySy8mcceTno,lol
ySy8mcceTno,Fake news
ySy8mcceTno,i Think if this were made by Universal Pictures and Twisted Pictures then it would have more of a chance.
ySy8mcceTno,If I was in this movie id be packing up and leaving...
ySy8mcceTno,Lol Why is senderman making wolf nosies? You just know this movie is going to be terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,"Walk in the woods
Found a dead body 
And slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 him
ySy8mcceTno,lo que menos se vio en este trailer fue a slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This is the movie or the trailer????
ySy8mcceTno,Go back to 2013 when creepypastas were actually enjoyable.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man won’t be in this movie that much... I can tell...
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a prequel to the emoji movie 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,A new contender for John Cena.
ySy8mcceTno,Ughhhhh ??? Too late guys. The hype is died

ySy8mcceTno,Sony never learns
ySy8mcceTno,But what’s the point? Is there any plot lol??
ySy8mcceTno,"When I saw this...

I was cursing the entire time."
ySy8mcceTno,tomara que o Slender Man não seja apenas um monstro nesse filme e a história do filme não ter nada a ver com ele
ySy8mcceTno,Pedófilo pimbando as crianças no mato... Onde foi para o Brasil?

ySy8mcceTno,Remember when those 3 girls went into the woods and 2 of them stabbed the other one 17 times because “slender man made them do it”?
ySy8mcceTno,"""People just don't disappear""  Yes they do. They are abducted by other evil humans ever day never to be seen again. These are the monsters you should worry about."

ySy8mcceTno,Remember when some girls tried to kill another girl in Wisconsin?
ySy8mcceTno,Yeeeeeeeessssssssssss
ySy8mcceTno,Please be good. Please.
ySy8mcceTno,"#canyouseehim?      






No cause he barely in the trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful. I think I'll stick to marble hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes YEES
ySy8mcceTno,"You’re a little bit late, I don’t think he’s relevant anymore"
ySy8mcceTno,Was this really necissary?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought slender man died off in 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,2012 a year to celebrate slender man hopefully this won't suck
ySy8mcceTno,Worst scary movie ever well at least the trailer lol
ySy8mcceTno,Eh
ySy8mcceTno,all no sense only watching to know
ySy8mcceTno,"what does this have to do with slenderman? His character isn't something that makes people kill themselves and he isn't a haunt. There's also just random sounds being played wtf, boo"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm ready for this
ySy8mcceTno,When has a movie made about a videogame ever been good?
ySy8mcceTno,Yass
ySy8mcceTno,Lol ha :)
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,me:Oh a slender man movie finally: (5 seconds into trailer see's Sony logo)me: sigh's are you kidding me the same people who made the emoji movie are making a slender man movie!? why aren't they dead?
ySy8mcceTno,"Awesome, the actual real creature that gets more powerful in the more people know about it having a major motion picture made about it! You're literally going to get people killed!"
ySy8mcceTno,Ok
ySy8mcceTno,And now a minecraft-movie pls
ySy8mcceTno,1:16 is literally the same clip being reversed and played over and over again :(
ySy8mcceTno,"Deixa eu ver esse Slender na minha frente pra ele ver, ia tira pra fora meu trabuco de 28 cm e vami ver quem ia correr"
ySy8mcceTno,The fad passed like 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,_Até arrepia_
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to not watch this
ySy8mcceTno,Why you gotta do me like that with the eye poking in the beginning man.. not cool
ySy8mcceTno,:/
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like an awesome fan film!
ySy8mcceTno,Better then the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,YOU ACTORS SHOULD MAKE A FALLOUT 4 MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,:(
ySy8mcceTno,ZZZzzZZZ
ySy8mcceTno,4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Too late
ySy8mcceTno,Haha H 1:08
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like what Gabe made on the office to scare the others
ySy8mcceTno,2012 pewdiepie anybody?
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember the ""Slender Man"" case where two young teens killed another teen girl because ""slender man told us too"""
ySy8mcceTno,L
ySy8mcceTno,Remember back in 2012 when Slender Man was actually popular? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
ySy8mcceTno,wow its not like its 10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Bro they actually did a video
ySy8mcceTno,"It doesn't look that horrible, i think."
ySy8mcceTno,Lol no
ySy8mcceTno,its about time this came out
ySy8mcceTno,Here are some notes. 1: WOW IS THIS LATE OR WHAT? 2: I think they are going to go for the psychological horror for slender. I think this is good because most things you see of him is just him with static and chasing you down.
ySy8mcceTno,If there's gonna be any adaptations from Creepypastas? Warner Bros. should actually make NES Godzilla into a movie from the story by Cosbydaf. Red to be played by Frank Welker.
ySy8mcceTno,Mmm right after that girl was almost killed my her other friends I just think it's wrong. Like if you agree ♥️
ySy8mcceTno,"It's a shame they couldn't get Kurt Russell in it.

(Those whom watch YGO:TAS will get this)"
ySy8mcceTno,15 years later
ySy8mcceTno,Took you long enough
ySy8mcceTno,"Its sad they made this ripped off jumpscare looking movie

Slenderman is quite the opposite, quiet and quite decieving; leading you to believe he's peaceful by luring you in rather than chasing you down..
wouldve been better if this was made in maybe MAX 2013"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony executive: we need new movie ideas

Script writer: there was this game that was popular like, 7 years ago, but its-

Sony executive: THATS PERFECT"
ySy8mcceTno,Um lol this is nothing like the game or story. But good try!
ySy8mcceTno,The Bye Bye Man 2: Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks horrible
HUUUUUAAAAAAGGGGHHH!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh for me it doesnt look scary
ySy8mcceTno,This would've been cool 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Only 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Dad?
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao boring trailer vai ser chato quiero decir der Mann mucho diferente
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus Christ I Cant Wait To See How This Is Gonna Become A Boxoffice Flop.
ySy8mcceTno,"First of all that's not Slenderman the Slenderman we know and are scared of has white skin a black suit and a red tie (also tentacles) instead this one looks like he's a walking shadow which is stupid,and why do we need a Slenderman movie when we can easily watch marble hornets on YouTube for free that has a better  plot than this crap. But instead your expecting us to give you money to see this movie when it is dumb and looks like half of it will be visions of crap in black and white looking like someone took acid while directing these scenes. I'm not being a hater it's just that this movie should be scrapped because it's probably a money grab for you greedy people."
ySy8mcceTno,"Um......






What is this?"
ySy8mcceTno,8 years later
ySy8mcceTno,"eh I'm sure a different film company could do better. This just looks like another bland horror movie, shame."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony keeps bringing those hits!
ySy8mcceTno,This is just a slap in the face to the Slenderman stabbings.
ySy8mcceTno,First Channel Zero (candel cove) now this?? What next dam Ben drowned?
ySy8mcceTno,Who fucking thought this was a good idea
ySy8mcceTno,and thats how you miss the hype train
ySy8mcceTno,Waitingggg fr d moviee
ySy8mcceTno,Did he roar
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting forever to see this movie and the trailer just disappointed me. :-(
ySy8mcceTno,Slender parecendo com o Demongorgon do Stragher Things😂
ySy8mcceTno,I bet all the fan made films (over the years) still better than this hollywood funded movie
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late but excited eitherway
ySy8mcceTno,Sucks
ySy8mcceTno,Vine por el momo en MC
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for spongebob summoning
ySy8mcceTno,"well for those who are not convinced with the trailer, u can't be surprised after all it's Sony : beautiful yet hollow, the motto for their movies with high expectation
plus I put a dislike because I never was able to stand the game.... -freaks me the heck out-"
ySy8mcceTno,Dear god 1:40
ySy8mcceTno,Im glad that it has reference to the slender lore with the blocky text and mental illness. The black and white video kinda reminds me of totheark. I hope it isn't too stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,*dreams do come true*
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER MAN IS GETTING A MOVIE?!
ySy8mcceTno,First the Emoji Movie and now this
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender-Man, (2010 story):
*Raw horror
*Builds on atmosphere
Slender-Man, (2018 movie):
*Jumpscares
*Shock value"
ySy8mcceTno,Next they’ll be making a herobrine movie... my god
ySy8mcceTno,Anybody remembers who is slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,Mindless cash grab
ySy8mcceTno,Looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,"The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! 
These kind of events are all signs! 

Repent of your sins and put your faith in The Lord! 
Jesus Loves you!
He is not angry at you, and neither does He hate you. 

The Lord died for us, He took our punishment on Himself. He loves us that much. 

He rose again the 3rd day, and assured us of our redemption! Hallelujah!

Death can't hold Him down, and He won't let death hold us down either if you repent and turn to Him today. 

He will help you. He is not expecting you to clean yourself. He will do it. You just need to come to Him. He will take care of the rest. He will forgive you, wash you, and make you new, friends. 
He personally did it for me! Thank You, Jesus!

He will also deliver you from the oncoming judgement approaching this earth. He made a Way for us to escape, which is Himself on the cross for us. 

So if you don't know Jesus, please make Him Lord of your life today. You will be saved! No fancy prayer needed, just a speak from the heart. 

Shalom."
ySy8mcceTno,Warner should made creepypastas movies this Looks out of context
ySy8mcceTno,"Only Sony the trash movie company, would make a movie about a trash creepy pasta."
ySy8mcceTno,"I know the Slender Man legend existed before the game, but they really should have added that iconic static."
ySy8mcceTno,Algum Br ??
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,podem me chamar de psicopata mas eu n senti nenhum pingo de medo desde trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this film was written and directed by Logan Paul.
ySy8mcceTno,"You are late.
8 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,Holy fack
ySy8mcceTno,The best creepypasta return
ySy8mcceTno,20% Moist Meter
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah I was really looking forward to this, I’m disappointed."
ySy8mcceTno,I love this part than past movies
ySy8mcceTno,Would be better if the movie was played out to be like marble hornets not some shitty modern horror movie only made for money. I won't be watching this anytime soon
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to fail and little kids will think it's the new exorsist. What is wrong with you.
ySy8mcceTno,"*if this film came out between 2009 and 2013* 'wow there just making this film because its popular"" *film comes out now* ""wow why are they making this now that it is not popular"" YOU LOSE, GOOD DAY SIR."
ySy8mcceTno,was it to much of a hard concept to put someone in the F woods searching for the 8 notes while slender follows him? nope instead give me a random trailer with your typicall stereotype possed girl which has been over used in about 1000 movies. sometimes i think that they should replace these directors with people that didn't do a fancy education someone who playd the orginal slender game and crapped hes pants over and over again.
ySy8mcceTno,It's fake ?
ySy8mcceTno,Ojalá no la caguen >:v
ySy8mcceTno,can we please we get more movies about creepypastas? i mean candle cove got a miniseries for gods sake!
ySy8mcceTno,I see. Interesting.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they made a movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Really, now."
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for it finally to happen now we get to learn what really happened :)
ySy8mcceTno,They better not mess up one of my favourite games ever.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait, people ripped Logan Paul for the video he did but this video shows people killing them selves and mums the word.  I don’t like Logan Paul but this really deserve a discussion on what aspect of suicide is acceptable in entertainment."
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t be better then the bye bye man
ySy8mcceTno,Bro it’s 2018 not 2012
ySy8mcceTno,wow i love how they are totally not trying to make some of this movie related to Stranger Things (btw Im being sarcastic) also I thought Slender Man likes to kill people not posses them like it makes no sense
ySy8mcceTno,Also where tf is slender
ySy8mcceTno,"This is either going to be REALLY good, or REALLY bad. My money is on the latter."
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't getting into people's minds more like Smile Dog's thing? XD
ySy8mcceTno,**Facepalm**
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man TAKES people not possess people it even stares it in the original creepy pasta
ySy8mcceTno,It’s going to be some vg to movies cheap bs
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood is officially out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,kinda meh
ySy8mcceTno,Like si deberian hacer las paliculas de los demas creppyypastas como la de jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Who remebers pewdiepie playin slenderman. Man good times
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os br fã de slender? 🖤
ySy8mcceTno,Aaaah q delícia cara
ySy8mcceTno,"Everytime I see a Sony Production, I think of the Emoji movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This is for real?
ySy8mcceTno,"Btw, slenderman will be in like, five minutes of this movie, so don't trust the title. K? GOOD."
ySy8mcceTno,Better late than never
ySy8mcceTno,When you're so out of ideas you take inspiration from a Reddit photoshop contest and a crappy game
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s see how Sony ruins this.
ySy8mcceTno,""" #CanYouSeeHim ""
No :v"
ySy8mcceTno,And I thought Sony entertainment had no creativity after the emoji movie. Stop making me embarrassed to own your products guys.
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,Yes finally!!!! 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Já começamos o ano muito bem com essa notícia desse filme <3
S2"
ySy8mcceTno,Main story: girl lost papers. Goes find them. Slender finds her too. The end.
ySy8mcceTno,Mmmeeeehhhhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,"This will be nothing but a crappy, poorly-paced, emo, edgy garbage ripoff of both stranger things and the blair witch project, dirrected by a company who A, can rarley make a film correctly, and B, has ties to dumba***es who made THE EMOJI MOVIE. This will fail, and everyone know's it, so please, DONT GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THIS GREADY-A*** COMPANY JUST TO WATCH A CASH-GRAB SH*T-SHOW THAT FELL INTO OBSCURITY 2 FRICKIN' YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And with that, I just saved you some precious time and money. Your welcome...🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪"
ySy8mcceTno,Kids who watch Markiplier and Tobygames probably have no clue what they’re about to get into
ySy8mcceTno,I'll need new pants after watch this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"always watches....


no eyes...."
ySy8mcceTno,omg weak af
ySy8mcceTno,TE DESAFIO A XINGAR O COMENTARIO ABAIXO KKKKK
ySy8mcceTno,"Spoiler!: Scooby and the gang unmask Slender Man at the end. Turns out to be bitter, old Mr. Sessions who was trying to scare kids so they wouldn't smoke weed."
ySy8mcceTno,VIM PELO DAVA JONAS
ySy8mcceTno,"See, the character In the trailer is not slender. It doesn't seem like the mystery and terror I had when I was a boy. It seems like a loud, jumpscare like movie. What it will turn out to be is not yet known, but I have low expectations just from the trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Just give him 20 dollars and you'll be safe
ySy8mcceTno,Agora nunca maia eu durmo ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,"Several problems. The title ""Slender Man"" should be changed to ""Slender"". Also you're a little too late, eight years off the mark. Although I really want to see this movie come out, people will start controversy because of the stabbing too."
ySy8mcceTno,Let's wait until they ruin this completely
ySy8mcceTno,"The typical shitty horror film of today. No suspense, no mystery, no story. Just a bunch of demonic stuff and jump scares."
ySy8mcceTno,BIEEEENNNNNNNN
ySy8mcceTno,"First the Emoji Movie, now this?

What's next? FNAF movie!??!

Oh wait..."
ySy8mcceTno,"*Hopefully it's actually scary alot of ""scary"" movies lately have been meh. If it's rated R it has hope if it's rated PG-13 it's gonna be garbage.*"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo um sorry to break this to you but youre REALLY late like SUPER late
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,This was a really bad trailer lmao
ySy8mcceTno,It’s gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Ive never cringed so hard. Even when one of my toenails got ripped out I didnt cringe this hard. This will be a meme. Someone please hack Sony again and stop this.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg!! Cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like it’s gonna be rlly good holy heck
ySy8mcceTno,And it’s not like we can make better movie cuz Sony just took the name lol
ySy8mcceTno,Gimme 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,Otia puta
ySy8mcceTno,oque falar desse slendermen que parece o demogorgon
ySy8mcceTno,"my 5th grade self would be so happy, a bit too late with this one."
ySy8mcceTno,Bro the movie is called slender man not slenderman :/
ySy8mcceTno,Filme merda
ySy8mcceTno,Omfg Yasssssss
ySy8mcceTno,Someone send this to Markiplier NOW
ySy8mcceTno,And I fought this franchise had died half a decade ago.
ySy8mcceTno,So that’s what happened to my mans will byers
ySy8mcceTno,"This shouldn't be a thing. What's next, a Jeff The Killer movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,"If you see him...
😱😱 EXPECTO PETRONUM.!.!!!😱😱"
ySy8mcceTno,Quem cago de medo véi
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, you already fucked this up."
ySy8mcceTno,This is lame. There's no suspense. Slenderman is creepy because he's mysterious. There's no mystery here.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is in really REALLY bad taste, considering that an actual girl was almost killed because of this garbage."
ySy8mcceTno,looks like it's going to be really cliche and boring. a few jump scares and a <20% rotten tomatoes score is my guess.
ySy8mcceTno,"Yah, but why tho"

ySy8mcceTno,Wow there's actually going to be a movie about this creepypasta... the stories were true
ySy8mcceTno,Spoopy
ySy8mcceTno,Is it possible a good Creepy pasta movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Im famous!
ySy8mcceTno,Thought it said spider man
ySy8mcceTno,This is giving me the It vibes
ySy8mcceTno,Who knew some internet challenge 's winning piece would be made to a movie 👏👏
ySy8mcceTno,OMG O.O
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, I didn't think they'd actually do it, but...wow.

What's next, a movie for Jeff the Killer? Eyeless Jack? Zalgo?

This is gonna get weird isn't it?"
ySy8mcceTno,no sale slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Little to late guys...
ySy8mcceTno,Cause we know how well the last Sony movie turned out lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Took you 9 years, But I’m still gonna be pumped to see this."
ySy8mcceTno,Omfg i waited 9012931 hours to it t
ySy8mcceTno,"Umm, what? Slender movie after almost ten years?"
ySy8mcceTno,This is way too late
ySy8mcceTno,"This could literally be any shitty generic horror movie they've released over the past five years, just with Slenderman stuck on for brand recognition."
ySy8mcceTno,"Didn't even stick to most of the lore. Wth, it does look good but the only scary about it is the people themselves and not the accual slenderman who only messes with your head, causing not major hallucinations and memory loss. Geeze this would look good if there were just.more lore to it from the original. Still think marble hornets is better, but at least i bet the movie is better than the other slenderman movie(showing only slenderman freakn once* thats an exageration*) stilla marble hornets fan though. I feel it'll just be like the 1st slender movie which had .5% of slender in it. Right now, it doesn't look good and I'm gonna start binging marble hornets who made the best Slenderman video/movie so far. Keep trying though, and lets see some Jeff the Killer lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Esse filme vai ser apenas outro clichê e muita gente quase não se lembrava mais dessa lenda urbana '-'
ySy8mcceTno,ITS ABOUT TIME!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it's about time we stop, don't ya think Sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,this is fukkin hilarious. !!🤣
ySy8mcceTno,"Produtores, se vcs não sabem, com o slender só vale uma coisa: nunca olhar para trás. Essa abordagem pegaria melhor do que         crianças sendo possuidas ou mortas por ele."
ySy8mcceTno,Mas o slender man só aparece no final do trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Dos mesmos criadores de Death Note o filme e Emoji o filme vem aí...
Slender Man!"
ySy8mcceTno,What kind of trash is this
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this is gonna be better than the Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Massa demais
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man must die
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so excited
ySy8mcceTno,eita preula
ySy8mcceTno,*S T O P  I T  G E T  S O M E  H E L P*
ySy8mcceTno,Wait Sony made this? This is automatically going to be trash..
ySy8mcceTno,But who knows it might be good nor bad or both
ySy8mcceTno,Why couldn't they make this in 2012 when slender man was relevant
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh this looks like the ring but a taller figure based off a creepy pasta and with low production value in my eyes it looks like that kind of movie which it seems to take the low production value and add shock value to make money.
ySy8mcceTno,Trash movie alreday seen it. Crappy character development the plot is terrible cgi is trash. Dont watch this movie👎👎👎👎
ySy8mcceTno,"90% Of Horror Movies Are Just Trash Nowdays Because Every Good Jumpscare Has Been Played Like 100 Times, But I Believe That You Can Get Some Good Fresh Content Out Of This One, And If They Squeeze Everything Out Of It, This Could Become A Really Good Horror"

ySy8mcceTno,Uh...da heck? Am I the only one who was left completely confused by that trailer? What the hell just happened? Is the full movie going to be that confusing?
ySy8mcceTno,It’s it a bit too late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Who else was waiting for a movie like this to finally happen?
ySy8mcceTno,Solid 6 years late on the trend
ySy8mcceTno,either that was a shitty trailer that didn’t explain anything or it’s just a shitty movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Psh....
ySy8mcceTno,Have them feature the Slenderman shooting
ySy8mcceTno,"Most kids: This doesn’t even involve slender man!  It’s just a girl who talks about him!

ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy they’re starting to make movies based off creepypastas now.
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called....they want their creepypasta back.....
ySy8mcceTno,"Just one question.
 
 
 
 
Why?"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony would be saving a lot of money if they just release this straight to redbox
ySy8mcceTno,This looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,"Unfortunately.. this movie looks like it sorta, sucks"
ySy8mcceTno,So we're finally getting a slendy movie I hope it's good
ySy8mcceTno,I would really like to see more of slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks nothing like Slender. Congratulations on a possibly new horrible film, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,"You wanted a story about a thing the looks vaguely human stalking quietly, leaving little trace behind other than a corpse. Mystery, dread, a few scares, and moments that make your skin scrawl.
Instead, you get pointless jump scares, teen drama, and loud noises. Bet this will be rated PG-13."
ySy8mcceTno,"All the toxicity needs to calm down. This trailer tells us nothing, wait for a more coherent trailer before calling this movie trash"
ySy8mcceTno,*squealing intensifies*
ySy8mcceTno,"I’d actually want a cinematic universe of creepy pastas, like candle cove. Just imagine all the good spooks you could do in a old 1980’s puppet tv show, and especially with a police officer investigating the old warehouse."

ySy8mcceTno,This video gave me so many flashbacks from 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Ohhh ok I got chills but.didn't think I got scared.it creppypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Candle cove  would make a better movie
ySy8mcceTno,New cinematic universe. CreepyPastaverse is what I wanna see happen. I mean who tf wouldn’t want to see a Jeff The Killer Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"First a game called slender.
Now a movie.
What is going on."
ySy8mcceTno,>:V
ySy8mcceTno,Every gamers dream
ySy8mcceTno,who wants to watch this movie cause i do !_!
ySy8mcceTno,"One of the creators of Marble Hornets is working on a related comic and EverymanHYBRID and TribeTwelve are STILL FUCKING GOING along with some of the other slenderverse ARGs so while yes, Slender Man is still a thing, it's kind of a niche interest and I don't understand how they expect to make money from something like this"
ySy8mcceTno,"So if slender man takes kids, does that mean if you make it to your 18th birthday and become an adult, then you’re safe?"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is gonna suck, it has the words sony, in it, its gonna fail."
ySy8mcceTno,finally they figured out to do this...
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets better get paid for their character getting stolen by Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,If he ain't got that stylish suit he ain't Slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,Niet eng
ySy8mcceTno,"Nooooooooooossa manoooooooo, esse ano Vey"
ySy8mcceTno,"These ""scary movies"" Are starting to be the same now"
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m finna watch this movie, best believe."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like an fan film
ySy8mcceTno,wth did i just see...
ySy8mcceTno,"Great , slender man gave me nightmares when I play the game and now there’s a movie! Looks like I won’t be sleeping for a while"
ySy8mcceTno,Wer ist auch gehyped?
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol, looks like they ran out of ideas, now they have to resort to boring and unoriginal movies"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:34
Logan paul pulls out the camera"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh nah, this should’ve been released like a good 5 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,"What happened to slender man with a no face, white head, long arms, tentacles, and a suit





And you should add the 8 notes around the forest so it seems more like the game"
ySy8mcceTno,"if creepypasta movies are gonna be a thing, then i'd like to see a film about the russian sleep experiment"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Why all modern horror movies have to be teens and gore, its a shitti formula for lazy writters."
ySy8mcceTno,SOMBODY TOOK MY SPAGET!
ySy8mcceTno,Intresting
ySy8mcceTno,When I was 7 this scared me a lot and now I can't wait to see what scared as a child
ySy8mcceTno,Faltaron los proxys :'v
ySy8mcceTno,Do u no de way
ySy8mcceTno,i want to die
ySy8mcceTno,This movie does not seem that good because it's not connected to the game
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim?
ySy8mcceTno,Pensé que era mentira XD
ySy8mcceTno,Cashgrab
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man came long way. From a creepypasta to a game. From a game to a movie. 
Can't wait to see this😉"
ySy8mcceTno,Clearly they’ve never read the Creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,#Canyouseehim...Not if he's John Cena
ySy8mcceTno,I agree with everyone who says this should be a Psychological Horror movie because it would fit the Real life story of the teen girls that stabbed their friend because they said Slenderman told them to. Films like the Shining and The Babadook know exactly how to pull off the Psychological theme so i don't think it would be hard if you got a talented Writer and Director to do that.
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m interested, but not excited"
ySy8mcceTno,Its only a game
ySy8mcceTno,This is spooky!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks... okay I guess?? I can't even really tell what the story is, but I'll probably go see it anyway."
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman series on my channel
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepypasta fans are shook. (I’m shook)
When they are in the forest it’s like they are in the upsidedown"
ySy8mcceTno,I haven't heard that name in years
ySy8mcceTno,this is slender Man not death note.
ySy8mcceTno,wait this is real-
ySy8mcceTno,Don't botch this Sony. You're already 5 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,You know a scary movie's gonna suck when you're laughing throughout the trailer. 😂
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look that good in the trailer hopefully the movie proves me wrong
ySy8mcceTno,I'm just saying watch them come up with some bullshit plot armor to make the girl kill Slenderman bru
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the static
ySy8mcceTno,(Tentacles)
ySy8mcceTno,This is Just crazy
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmm, not enough tenticles for my liking."
ySy8mcceTno,This has nothing to do with Slenderman. Also Sony don't try reviving a dead meme that was dead for so long.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya es tarde






5 años tarde"
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I get Freddy Krueger vibes from this?
ySy8mcceTno,"Even the kool aid killer was better than this, does anyone else remember that video?"
ySy8mcceTno,But where are the pages they have to find?
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn't seem slenderman, pretty crappy I think"
ySy8mcceTno,Nossa q boasta
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sorry but that trailer was really good
ySy8mcceTno,Por fin un tráiler que no es fan made
ySy8mcceTno,Fat Woman is scarier. Trust me.
ySy8mcceTno,10/10 would recommend to edgelords only
ySy8mcceTno,"What next? A Jeff the killer the movie?
But seriously it looks pretty good."
ySy8mcceTno,Horrible girl victim is from my town dont like this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Que rico se ve la película, excelente para invitar a mi novia al cine para no hacer caso a la película, sólo para invitar a besarnos y tocarnos dentro de la función. :D"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope other memes have cameos in this film.
ySy8mcceTno,"Put# que Pariu

Run to the Hills"
ySy8mcceTno,"So Slenderman is real, or fake? For Christ sakes can't he make up his mind"
ySy8mcceTno,lol whut
ySy8mcceTno,cagala kabron y te mato v:<
ySy8mcceTno,With special participation with Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Hey remember when those 2 little girls killed their best friend because they said slender man told them to..
ySy8mcceTno,#youcanseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"1:41 we know what happen when you see a slender....

Game over"
ySy8mcceTno,Nooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,"Not really thrilled with the trailer, I love creepy pasta so I'm going to end up watching it anyways"
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh can't wait for the memes lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets had a better plot
ySy8mcceTno,looks like trash.
ySy8mcceTno,Found a dead person in the woods!
ySy8mcceTno,"What an awful trailer, I've never seen something this bad"
ySy8mcceTno,#VimPeloDavyJones
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!
ySy8mcceTno,"Y si hicieran un universo crepy con slenderman jeff the killer
Seria genial"
ySy8mcceTno,who ever created the urban legend failed to trademark it
ySy8mcceTno,Since when did Slender Man posses people
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, this movie is way to late."
ySy8mcceTno,What next?😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Either it's going to be a shock hit like IT or just plain trash like the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets did it better.
ySy8mcceTno,"I really want this movie to be good. At the same time, i feel like it won't be"
ySy8mcceTno,Why are you making a slender man movie? So dumb.
ySy8mcceTno,He's finally getting a proper movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Yooooo, nobody ain't gonna mention the incident with those twins who played some game with their best friend ,went into the woods and ended up almost killing their friend by stabbing her because ""Slenderman"" told them to stab someone?"
ySy8mcceTno,Walk in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Meh, as long as its not anoth Saw or insidious movie oh wait🤔"
ySy8mcceTno,Sarah...
ySy8mcceTno,Every 12 year old girl in the world must be excited.
ySy8mcceTno,Why just why did you run out of ideas disappointed af
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 for the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,4 seconds in..and there goes my boxers.
ySy8mcceTno,Achei meio bosta mas td bem
ySy8mcceTno,I am genuinely excited for this movie :)
ySy8mcceTno,Idk about this
ySy8mcceTno,The rake??
ySy8mcceTno,This is more like a B-grade horror film with Slenderman in it.
ySy8mcceTno,Thia strangely reminds me of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,I expect to see a movie about shadow link next. Smh
ySy8mcceTno,And how long ago was slender  man a thing EXACTLY
ySy8mcceTno,Great can't wait to see the CPEU (Creepy Pasta Extended  Universe)    I say sarcastically
ySy8mcceTno,#GoodMovie
ySy8mcceTno,Perfect for Lwiay
ySy8mcceTno,c mamo slundurmun :v
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is my idol he is awesome
ySy8mcceTno,Found a dollar in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,I did not know slender man was this popular
ySy8mcceTno,Ae ele está de volta
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok this would have been a good movie if we were able to watch the pschological break down of a teen being hunted in the woods. Not oh they gone, oof she back oh no she be a stabbin de eye."
ySy8mcceTno,no not the russians!
ySy8mcceTno,As weird as this idea sound's a d kinda watch it
ySy8mcceTno,wow siempre quise algo asi
ySy8mcceTno,Well that was actually scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Couldn’t help but laugh when the baby started laughing.
ySy8mcceTno,Si es real podría valer una fortuna!
ySy8mcceTno,4 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't look right
ySy8mcceTno,It looks so generic! Pass!
ySy8mcceTno,there was a upcoming slender man movie called the ENTITY and no news of its update of its fate rather if its in development hell or a prank
ySy8mcceTno,Well dressed mythical creature of Male gender with skinny lanky stature
ySy8mcceTno,This is shite
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is everyone forgetting the news story about the two girls who stabbed another girl, almost killing her, because “slender man told them”? I’m pretty sure that’s what this movie is gonna be based off of.

Although it would be nice if they had the movie with the same story line of the game with finding pages, but in my opinion I like both."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,Watch someone make a movie about fnaf
ySy8mcceTno,I just sharted
ySy8mcceTno,Hope its a real movie
ySy8mcceTno,"*yawn*

ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be unbelievable trash

ySy8mcceTno,slender!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man movie trailer and you only see him for about 2 seconds

ySy8mcceTno,"Next creepy pasta movie...




IDK Jeff the killer or something"
ySy8mcceTno,"Aww, Donkey Spittle!"
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks terrible, it makes it look like the antagonist is the girl..."

ySy8mcceTno,is this canon or no?
ySy8mcceTno,Sony quero um jogo desse filme no ps4 flw
ySy8mcceTno,HERE WE GO
ySy8mcceTno,"For several years I have seen fan made trailers of Slender Man, but once I saw that Sony Pictures posted this video I knew it was real this time. I was so happy."
ySy8mcceTno,Eita porra o bagulho vai ser loko
ySy8mcceTno,ESSE VAI DEIXAR O OCO EM TD MUNDO!
ySy8mcceTno,Its finally here
ySy8mcceTno,Talking about milking a dead cow. I mean slenderman...really?
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,I am so ready to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,Remember a couple years back when 2 girls tried to kill her friend as a sacrifice to slender man I do
ySy8mcceTno,Tá saindo da Jaula o Monstro Poha😂
ySy8mcceTno,"It's not that cool or scary, and slender man doesn't possess people if it's going back to those two girls who tried to murder their friend in the woods it's cause they were idiots. And it doesn't look scary :\"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow guys, I was thinking this looks like one of those classic horror movies we'll be talking about in a decade. Like Feardotcom. Classic."
ySy8mcceTno,Man is this E D G Y
ySy8mcceTno,2012 gonna be crazy!
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY GOD !
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is real y’all trust me I know...
ySy8mcceTno,:v
ySy8mcceTno,How come Logan Paul got viral for all of his raw content but yet..this is not
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things 3 looks like garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"interesting well I think you had a little mistake , seems you forget to add the SLENDERMAN character don't you think? you know... like THE MAIN CHARACTER?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Marik and Bakura brought me here to hear the gay elephant noise at 1:23 
Was not dissapointed."
ySy8mcceTno,woah woah woah is this happening fr
ySy8mcceTno,"This summer, Adam Sandler is....the SLENDERMAN"
ySy8mcceTno,S O U T H  A M E R I C A  M E M E S  !!
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look like slender :/
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm...I'm not getting SlenderMan feels from this...more like 'Conjuring' or something...welp still  gonna give it a shot. Might be good.
ySy8mcceTno,Just release this on dvd or vod cause its not worth putting this bullshit to the cinemas
ySy8mcceTno,Ohhhh nooo
ySy8mcceTno,Desde Creepypasta hasta película bienvenido a doc tops
ySy8mcceTno,Can you imagine the girl who got stabbed almost to death seeing even this trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony would make a creepypasta movie that is 8 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,"0:48
""O cara entra dentro de sua casa, come sua bunda e você não pode falar nada!"""
ySy8mcceTno,holywood/sony is so desperate for ideas and new franchise  that they know adapt creepypasta's...

ySy8mcceTno,Eeeee porra
ySy8mcceTno,You’ve got to be kidding me
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the Meme Movie everyone was talking about after the Emoji Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated film of 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,The meme has been dead for 6 years Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,...so where's my man?
ySy8mcceTno,That looked stupid & random af
ySy8mcceTno,Olha nao fico bom essa aparencia do Slenderman mais tb nao fico uma bosta fico mais omenos na minha opinião é claro
ySy8mcceTno,Español ??
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this feel more like a fan made trailer with budget???
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer looks like the tape from the ring
ySy8mcceTno,You're a bit late there
ySy8mcceTno,You just had to bring my nightmares back
ySy8mcceTno,"I think I'd still prefer Marble Hornets over this, but that's just me I guess."
ySy8mcceTno,Best Creepypasta Ever
ySy8mcceTno,"vai ser aquele tipo de filme de terror nojento, n gosto tando de filmes assim mas vamos dar uma chance"
ySy8mcceTno,Um
ySy8mcceTno,Hola
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see this in theaters
ySy8mcceTno,Fnaf movie???
ySy8mcceTno,Should have just consulted marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn't seem to have the Slenderman I've come to expect. I don't feel the mystery, or the raw terror that his character is supposed to inspire from this trailer which amounted to a bunch of random scenes without any seeming connection between them. Terrible trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Now can we PLEASE see a FNAF trailer
ySy8mcceTno,ya se habían tardado
ySy8mcceTno,wow cool
ySy8mcceTno,Por un momento sentí que estaba mirando el vídeo maldito de el Aro
ySy8mcceTno,Se me hace que es feik
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t you focus on the player in the game? Ik there isn’t much story to that but a good director can pull that off
ySy8mcceTno,Don't you wish sometimes that you could make a movie on your own cause you know that your ideas would make the movie 10x better.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is by Screen Gems? The same Screen Gems behind the Resident Evil films, Underworld films, and I Frankenstein? Oh boy..."
ySy8mcceTno,Where's his suit?
ySy8mcceTno,Where is miss peregrine ?
ySy8mcceTno,I CANT WAIT FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called....
ySy8mcceTno,I love how there making Creepy Pastas into movies and tv shows now.  Next Jeff the Killer (Louisiana version).
ySy8mcceTno,"This just goes to show how popular slender-man is. he's gotten multiple games, i've heard references in T.V shows, etc. and now he's getting a movie. he's basically in the corner of your eye with popularity. you can barely see it, but it's there"
ySy8mcceTno,Altıma yaptım bu arada türk yok mu
ySy8mcceTno,#SlenderIsBack
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff next...
ySy8mcceTno,marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this is going to suck. If you want to watch a slender man film just go to YouTube and search up Marble Hornets and watch the whole series.
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala kbron y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"AM I THE ONLY ONE WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE SINCE SLENDER MAN THE ARRIVAL????????????!!?!?! LAURA, KATE, CHARLIE, CARL ROSS AND SLENDER????? IM HYPED!!!!! but the trailer isnt good though :3"
ySy8mcceTno,took you long enough Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,spoopy
ySy8mcceTno,This is a huge disrespect to god
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman in 2018 really?????
ySy8mcceTno,Man if it dosen't show slender that much why even call the movie SlenderMan
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks trashy. I dont know anything about Slender man, if it started off as a game or not but from what i know usually games as movies turn out to be bad... Judging from this trailer it looks bad too :("
ySy8mcceTno,Who's watching while reading a comment below?
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if this is a spinoff from the  Conjuring 2??? He was in the movie with the Nun from what I remember.
ySy8mcceTno,You're over 5 years late. I hate to sound like a hipster but this IP is dead and gone.
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all are really late
ySy8mcceTno,lmao
ySy8mcceTno,...
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,🅱️lender Man...
ySy8mcceTno,Now make SlandyTubies
ySy8mcceTno,Awrsome! My friends and i will have another shitty horror movie to laugh at for a few hours!
ySy8mcceTno,The ting goes...
ySy8mcceTno,I dont care if it is suck movie i need to watch it
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t even look scary
ySy8mcceTno,Meu Deus do céu berg
ySy8mcceTno,Ever since i was 6 I've been waiting for a slender man movie to arrive in Australia I'm excited
ySy8mcceTno,Corre negão
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man Gangnam style
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting..  For a long long long time.  I know a lot of you are like,  oh this is gonna be trash.  I think I'll wait for it to come out.. Then I'll watch it^^"
ySy8mcceTno,"Psychological Horror, have you all heard about it? The game works this way, the urban legend works this way, and now the movie too. STOP PLEASE."
ySy8mcceTno,Stopped being scary in 2012....
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't know how to hold a marker
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn’t really make sense they should make a stalker type movie where you don’t see him only out of the sides of your vision and the thought of the character being insane or scared is the real horror not some physiological monster that makes you kill your self.
ySy8mcceTno,"ive always been really into slender, and im actually pretty interested to see this, i just hope it does justice for the games and doesnt ruin slender like netflix ruined death note"
ySy8mcceTno,oh my
ySy8mcceTno,Justo años después de que paso de moda se les ocurre hacer una película de esto 😑😒😒😒
ySy8mcceTno,I actually thought this was just some trash YouTube fake movie the emoji movie now this¿
ySy8mcceTno,This disgusting LOL my heart is so weak for this
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are kinda late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,the only thing scary or disturbing about this was the sound of the marker against the mirror
ySy8mcceTno,Why did you guys don't like it? Just because it's a game movie? What's the problem? It was a good trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is back
ySy8mcceTno,Now we just need Jeff the Killer to get his own movie and we will have both of the most popular creepypastas on the big screen.
ySy8mcceTno,WHAT YEAR IS IT!!!???
ySy8mcceTno,So hyped
ySy8mcceTno,creepypasta ebooks are lit
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Im sure this movie will suck but ill give it a chance. 
My theory is that slenderman with just give the victims suicidal thoughts and terrifying hallucinations, when they can't handle it they'll just kill themselves. And 90% of the movie won't even have slendy in it."
ySy8mcceTno,A little late
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,com o cu na mão
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the two girls who killed in his name? They'd be perfect for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone see Slenderman once in this trailer???🤔🤔🤔

ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry but as a fan of Slenderman, I need confirmation that Slenderman will actually have something to do with this movie. We waited a long time for this movie Sony, so don't sell a cheap horror film with no Slender in it."

ySy8mcceTno,The movie It had a scarier trailer then this this is straight bbq
ySy8mcceTno,I need to see this :D
ySy8mcceTno,What is it gonna be about 2 girls stabbing there friend?
ySy8mcceTno,# Creepypasta the movie omg
ySy8mcceTno,beautiful  👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,Mi sueño mojado se hizo realidad :v
ySy8mcceTno,Why didnt they do it like marble hornets??
ySy8mcceTno,"My only problem so fare is that they have him killing so many people .
Slender mans objective has always  been to spreed the knowledge that he exists not simply to kill those who know of him. He is't supposed to be an active horror he's supposed to be the kind that might be just around the corner."
ySy8mcceTno,😂🔫
ySy8mcceTno,THE LEGEND IS BAD!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Please stop making movies Sony, thanks."
ySy8mcceTno,"It seems like it might be generic. But at least a *little* decent. May not follow the lore already set up but hey, what can you do with something that came out of a Photoshop contest?"
ySy8mcceTno,This isn't accurate slender man doesn't kill children he makes them proxy's and then he make them kill adults.
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I have a feeling that this is going to set up a creepypasta expanded universe?
ySy8mcceTno,Enderman
ySy8mcceTno,Curti muito não :/
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao???
ySy8mcceTno,"Dafuq?? This has nothing to do with Slender Man. I think that if it was a camera movie, teens stuck in the woods, and they ACTUALLY show him, people would watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,Si la pelicula es tan mala como el trailer no la veo
ySy8mcceTno,Pica da Galáxia
ySy8mcceTno,One meme I can see is when the girl was looking around for slender our god VSause can appear

ySy8mcceTno,"Who else thinks this is the start to a creepypasta universe 



Just me ok"
ySy8mcceTno,"I like the concept of The Slender Man. However, I think it's fair to say that Sony is likely using an old trend as a crutch...again. Slender Man should stay away from the big screen and stick to the fake photos.

P.S. Doesn't The Slender Man target more than just children/young individuals? If the video had shown people of various ages being attacked then it might have come across as more than the product of browsing Creepypasta for 30 minutes."
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see this
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the memes
ySy8mcceTno,Robert BroBrozky foi o ator que fez o Slenderman. :D
ySy8mcceTno,They ruined slenderman😯
ySy8mcceTno,This just looks like The Grudge more or less.
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMAN MOVIE IS MY FUCKIN IDEA AND I GOT A VERY GOOD AND DEEP AND ORIGINAL STORY LINE
ySy8mcceTno,"I left at start, you know i hate gore"
ySy8mcceTno,And I'm Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,OMG is my best friend slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,They're making a Slenderman movie. What's next? BEN DROWNED? Jeff The Killer? Laughing Jack?
ySy8mcceTno,unity made game... windows movie maker made movie confirmed
ySy8mcceTno,Oh oh nononono
ySy8mcceTno,I'm ready to punch someone in the throat
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger Things+Bray Wyatt theme+Sting theme= Slender Man & little bit venom from spiderman 3 too!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is my dude. It’s been a while ever since I’ve seen a movie about it.
ySy8mcceTno,too late
ySy8mcceTno,"He's supposed, to wear a suite smh"
ySy8mcceTno,not bad.
ySy8mcceTno,y'all can hate but tbh I'm interested
ySy8mcceTno,I have waited so long…
ySy8mcceTno,"This reminds me a lot of the Ring, specifically of the tape that summons Samara bc of all the weird eye and maggot stuff"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony... why...
ySy8mcceTno,"Why isn't slender man white? smh hollywood making white characters black, typical."
ySy8mcceTno,"I just hope they follow his lore, it is paining to watch the trailer and already see inaccuracies in what he can do. I mean I think they're just trying to make him so much more of a stereotypical horror movie monster than he actually is. I just hope they don't screw it up."
ySy8mcceTno,Still a better love story then twilight! xD
ySy8mcceTno,Nope too spoopy for me
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya es tarde, 15 años tarde!! >:'v"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks horrible? I hope they give the guy that actually created him money.
ySy8mcceTno,Yay a game based movie
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"Can’t wait for the dab movie, figet spinner movie, the meme movie, the vr movie, and whatever else Sony has planned for us."
ySy8mcceTno,Oof
ySy8mcceTno,"*6 more months..*
Oh Five Nights Of Freddy movie!
So cool!

*Edit* 
Heard that FNAF is already coming out. (Knew it)

*6 more months..*
Oh Minecraft movie!
So cOol"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wtf it’s back
ySy8mcceTno,YUS FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Brasil?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would be Better if it was like someone recording the experience in the forest and there encounters with Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good. Let's hope it IS good
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy bebé jajaja
ySy8mcceTno,I will cry from happiness
ySy8mcceTno,Mais de 8 anos depois sai o trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Omg who knew slender man would become a movie  lol not me
ySy8mcceTno,"Namoral, o trailer tá bacana? Sim.
Mas, parece algo bem bagunçado e filme de terror/horror genérico.
Erraram no Script do filme.
Ao meu ver, tá parecendo que vai ser  um daqueles filmes fracos de terror."
ySy8mcceTno,I don't understand all the hate this looks really good
ySy8mcceTno,"Way to miss the boat, Sony. We're all waiting for the Emoji sequel!"
ySy8mcceTno,Ryu o waga teki o kurau
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,ja to todo cagado so com o trailer uheueh
ySy8mcceTno,Pero Slender Man NO ES PROPIEDAD DE SONY
ySy8mcceTno,Algum br?
ySy8mcceTno,they'll make a movie out of anything popular 8 years ago won't they
ySy8mcceTno,Guys it’s just the trailer u never know it might actually might be a great horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,1:50 wtf jumpscare
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine this in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh look, another bad movie based off some random preexisting thing that will eventually have memes made out of it. How fun. BTW, this does not even look anything like the original creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh slenderman 😄😄😄
ySy8mcceTno,If this dies please please please let it drag the FNAF movie down with it!
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok let's be honest. This movie is just waiting to give out jump scares and should've been released in the early 2000's. We've seen special effects happen like this countless times. The story is nothing but plain and boring. Not even gonna bother trying to say what the character traits are for the protagonists. Here's an idea, WHY NOT JUST MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT SLENDERMAN INSTEAD OF HAVING THE RANDOM KIDS OR ADULTS IN THE AUDIENCES POINT OF VIEW!! THAT WOULD MAKE IT 10 TIMES MORE INTERESTING THAN WHAT WEVE NORMALLY SEEN IN HORROR! IN A NEW TURN! 🙄"
ySy8mcceTno,"So, 2 teens stab a girl (almost killing her) over an internet meme and the meme now is a horror movie?  Sounds like a good way for Sony to get sued."
ySy8mcceTno,to think that this was all inspired by a creepy pasta...
ySy8mcceTno,"Vai ser uma bosta , só pelo treiler vão estragar o Slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,But why tho
ySy8mcceTno,No mames
ySy8mcceTno,I only saw slender man at least once in this trailer. This better not be like the blaire witch where it's a camera and you only see the witch at the end.
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks more like ""Satan girl""......like seriously we only saw the outline of slenderman in the trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Pls ticci toby
ySy8mcceTno,Let the meme war commence
ySy8mcceTno,"Another generic garbage horror film based off another generic garbage horror game.

The horror genre died long ago."
ySy8mcceTno,No me da buena pinta...
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone think they’ll make a Jeff the killer movie??
ySy8mcceTno,"Thanks!

I hate it."
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 m m m money shot
ySy8mcceTno,Leave it to hollywood to screw up slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman doesn't do any of this wth
ySy8mcceTno,This feels more like a mix between Evil Dead and The Ring
ySy8mcceTno,I think it’s a little to late for a slender man movie in 2018
ySy8mcceTno,#icanseehim
ySy8mcceTno,I think it is a copy of strangers  things bad and very achieved 😒😡😒
ySy8mcceTno,About 3 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Not the 1. Comment but definitely not the last
ySy8mcceTno,I really want to see this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is triggered?
ySy8mcceTno,This should be rather Slender woman
ySy8mcceTno,"Doctor: ""sir, you've been in a coma since 2010""
Sony Pictures Entertainment: ""Oh great! I can't wait to start making that slenderman movie!"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Let's start the memes with vsauce
https://youtu.be/OsuAqGAe6pE"
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood running out of ideas......
ySy8mcceTno,They could make this sicuatric thriller barely showing the Slenderman at all but you can't expect big movie companies to make great movies
ySy8mcceTno,Porcaria
ySy8mcceTno,1:55 gemidão remasterizado
ySy8mcceTno,Any Horror Movie: The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Seems Sony have too much money and looking to how waste some!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Why!?!? I thought we left him in 2010!!

ySy8mcceTno,"lol, should talk to the guys who made marble hornets that stuff was scary"
ySy8mcceTno,Yes i cant see him because it is not a slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,"This is Don't Have ANYTHING With Slendy, Did The Makers of this Movie Played Slender Because.... I Think They Don't"
ySy8mcceTno,I mean it looks better than the slenderman movie they already made
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is dead. A new slender man game should be released before a movie to get a little hype.
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would dislike this, this is the best"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello 2012, didn't think you'd be back."
ySy8mcceTno,Can we leave it in 2012 please?
ySy8mcceTno,Marbel hornets or gtfo
ySy8mcceTno,Brought to you by the producers of the emoji movie we can only guess how good this is going to be......
ySy8mcceTno,Honest question. When was the last time the Slender Man was relevant?
ySy8mcceTno,Marik and Bakaura watch Slenderman the Movie. That's the only reason I would watch this movie. Make it happen Little Kuribo!!
ySy8mcceTno,Smh this is gonna be one of those shitty fan fics you see on Deviant Art but as a movie
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called. They want their slender mensch back.
ySy8mcceTno,Dava Jones ❤️
ySy8mcceTno,The movie no one asked for
ySy8mcceTno,About 7 years too late!
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know rick looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"I cant wait to pirate this movie, then delete it after 25 worthless minutes.."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm losing hope for a good that's movie based on a video game.
ySy8mcceTno,Completely horrific evil.  Period.
ySy8mcceTno,slender man? wholly crap I watched him alot when was smol now he's getting a movie? YES *YES*
ySy8mcceTno,"I think this movie is a very bad idea, Slendy won't like this~"

ySy8mcceTno,I may or may not be extremely disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,"The Slender Man Movie! 
A.K.A. 
90% Screaming Girls

ySy8mcceTno,2013 fever dreams come to the big screens
ySy8mcceTno,"For like, 5 years I've been waiting for this kind of movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks nothing like the game or a knock off it could be its own movie with a different name
ySy8mcceTno,Some how there was a movie before this and idk
ySy8mcceTno,"Worst Trailer ever,"
ySy8mcceTno,I would rather buy the game
ySy8mcceTno,Habla 2007 dicen que le regresen sus creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,Watch them ready to run this creepy pasta down to the ground
ySy8mcceTno,Finally but I don't think it's gonna be good
ySy8mcceTno,Where's PewDiePie?
ySy8mcceTno,Meh it looks ok
ySy8mcceTno,"Ahh Sony, you forgot that Slendy wears a suit didn't you?"
ySy8mcceTno,does somebody knows when the movie premiers?/¿alguien sabe cuando es que estrenan la pelicula?
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,whats going on
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer movie would be scarier  and awesome
ySy8mcceTno,maluco é bravo
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,Are you stuck in 2014 or something?
ySy8mcceTno,How are they going to make an hour and a half feature film when it takes you 10 minutes to beat the game?
ySy8mcceTno,This Is real?!!
ySy8mcceTno,i hope this will be better than Rings and emoji movie. 2017 was a bad year for the entertaiment world.
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Fico um coco ._ .
ySy8mcceTno,"sub for sub

ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Like 4 years too late but ok
ySy8mcceTno,Wha..........   Where the hell is slender man in the trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,This actually may be a good movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"One a scale of one through ten, the critics will probably give this movie a negative pi judging by trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope its not horror movie emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"*Movie about slender man *
His screentime: 2 secs"
ySy8mcceTno,"I think we would all agree that a slender man movie would be good, but if it is directed by sony its another story."
ySy8mcceTno,a bit too late dont you think
ySy8mcceTno,That doesnt really looks like slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Mina burra, nunca deve ter jogado nenhum dos jogos."
ySy8mcceTno,"ya know, maybe this movie would actually be hype if it was made 5 years ago when the myth of slender was actually relevant"
ySy8mcceTno,Didnt a girl almost get killed over this slenderman? They have a movie
ySy8mcceTno,óemige
ySy8mcceTno,Those people must be the toughest people ever to get away from slender man. Really did the writers even think about how slender man doesn't return his victims
ySy8mcceTno,After everything they went and made a movie to make money off of this really!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,CRINGE
ySy8mcceTno,Vai ser uma bosta

ySy8mcceTno,Yay another generic shitty horror movie. Supernatural entity in the distance? Do I run or stay here and breath loudly? I think i'll stay here and hope he doesn't find me yeah good.
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see a Jeff the killer movie. Sony make a creepypasta cinematic universe
ySy8mcceTno,"For a second I thought the title was SPIDER MAN and I was like, no, Sony, not again."
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer reveals nothing about the story . I have the feeling it's going to be bad like marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhhhh bien vergas :v
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late.. Now slender man is either a meme or the cause of an attempted murder

ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,I'm ending my life when this comes out
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, they could have thought of a better plot and actually researched him before making this, I mean come on. I was expecting a group of teens or something making their friend play a game with them to see if Slender is real and the only way to win is to get all eight notes and escape without dying."
ySy8mcceTno,I see a good future
ySy8mcceTno,ALGUM BR 🖒😁
ySy8mcceTno,Eh. Might be good. I feel like Sony is a little late to the party.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY JESUS
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly disappointed on the quality. It reminds me of how some short film on youtube not like a real film on the big screen. Or like cut scenes from a DIFFERENT game. Sony has really disappointed. Especially since its many years late. Maybe if they followed one the Slender games story line it would make it more of a slender feel.
ySy8mcceTno,Dava Jonas
ySy8mcceTno,Omg why would you come out with a SLENDER MAN movie??? Omg
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems a lil based more on Slender -The Arrival than the original game tjat gave slenderman popularity with the type of effects it shows when he ""gets in your head"". Oh and the memes better be fucking great for this, dont disappoint me on the memes"
ySy8mcceTno,"I couldn’t see him, what happened to the 8 pages, the game is probably more scarier than this, if this somehow succeeds, make a Jeff the killer, the rake, or just another creepypasta movie"
ySy8mcceTno,WEAK
ySy8mcceTno,Dreams are realized (*-*)
ySy8mcceTno,So dumb 😂🤣😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Can we not?

ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this I thought it was going to be more scary
ySy8mcceTno,algum Br?
ySy8mcceTno,"No, sorry, NEXT!"
ySy8mcceTno,"First: the name of the movie is ""Slender man"" and I saw him on just two scenes.
Second: this movie is a little late isn't it?"
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff The Killer When?
ySy8mcceTno,So is this gonna be one of those shitty PG-13 horror movies?

ySy8mcceTno,Sony Pictures still stuck in 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,*You most certainly will die...*
ySy8mcceTno,"OK, but frankly much too loud for a proper Slender Man.  What I'd read about the Slender Man, it's supposed to be very quiet.  Soft, silent, even gentle.  Even as you feel the terror you feel like it's drawing you in, welcoming you lovingly into the abyss of despair and insanity.  Rather than your stereotypical jump scare crap, I'd prefer something like that early part with just the low whistle and soft music, where you can tell something's off and you're growing more and more uneasy even as you question whether there's really even any reason to feel scared, and then, without any warning, it's already over.  No jump, no explosion and flood of sensory stimulus, just suddenly he's there and you know it's too late, then he's gone and you're either missing or dead or turning on your friends to kill them.  Slender Man is true terror, and it does not really lend itself to this sort of cheap jump-scare horror.  Lower budget, softer sounds, more unceasing fear and less jack-in-the-box idiocy."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks fantastic! I'm actually excited for this :D
ySy8mcceTno,Muito louco pra assistir 😃😃😃
ySy8mcceTno,Oh look it’s gonna be the stabbing story all over again
ySy8mcceTno,"Interesting, but it looks like they screwed with the mechanics a bit"
ySy8mcceTno,why slenderman looks more like an alien here?
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all were better off makinh a Five Nights at Freddy's movie......this is just what? A decade later?
ySy8mcceTno,the title screams slenderman but the trailer screams aliens
ySy8mcceTno,It’s just nightmare on elm street 2017
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,Too bad it's going to suck and spawn a cringe flooded fanbase.
ySy8mcceTno,"This isn't slender man it's a possession movie! I still want to see this, but seriously get your facts right."
ySy8mcceTno,"AI MEU SANTO CARAIBA 




SANGUE DE JESUS TEM PODERRRRR"
ySy8mcceTno,Я один русский?
ySy8mcceTno,"Seeing the title: Probanly some fanmade crap...
Seeing the channel: No way
Seeing the trailer: No, no, no
After the trailer: WTF, where is Slenderman!?
Also: Why is a movie like this coming out now!?"
ySy8mcceTno,I guess it won't be as bad as the game
ySy8mcceTno,:D i am so hype
ySy8mcceTno,"Wifey in the club, gimme $20"
ySy8mcceTno,Ho come the trailer is not as scary is mostly daytime.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg¡¡¡ Slenderman i very very nice in the terror
ySy8mcceTno,Crap
ySy8mcceTno,I would watch this but my anxiety will go to 100% again lmao and my mom won’t let me 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,I think that they are late to the whole slender man thing
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like a bad acid trip and a half but I'm there
ySy8mcceTno,I don't now about this one
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fan made kinda looks like it
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 HELL NOOO
ySy8mcceTno,When a Creepy Pasta hits the big screen
ySy8mcceTno,so we'll have to wait like 15 years for the dear David film
ySy8mcceTno,"A Slenderman movie, seriously!?!?!?!?"
ySy8mcceTno,And to think just a few years ago Slender Man was just in the video game Creepypasta I guess movie directors are desperate to get out and reach the child majority the watch Creepypastas so much if they made a movie about it let's just hope they actually take it seriously not a hate comment just saying
ySy8mcceTno,bueno no pero no lo arruinen
ySy8mcceTno,Did you see it at 2:14 ?
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf,  THE FCKING BLOOD IS BLACK. 
SONY?! pleaaase dont kill the hype from slenderman with this movie -.-*"
ySy8mcceTno,cagenla cabrones y los mato
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like dogshit.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol I thought this was rings
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't tell if this is a based on the true life story of the murder, or the fiction Slender Man lore. Or both? Either way; by the God's this looks like garbage."
ySy8mcceTno,wauuuuuuu que cool
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Wack
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was supposed to be a documentary style about the two girls in Wisconsin that tried sacrificing their friend the him and not a horror movie about slender?
ySy8mcceTno,This came out six years late
ySy8mcceTno,There 4 years late on the slenderman trend hes not scary anymore. Just make a jeff the killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,It’s 2018 my dude come on really your so many years late
ySy8mcceTno,"Spoiler alert avatar aang defeats fire Lord ozai,and takes his bending away."
ySy8mcceTno,"Stupid special effects. Trash story (if there is one). I didn't even see 
Slenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,Sure took them long enough
ySy8mcceTno,The actor who plays slendy is hot
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood killed it.
ySy8mcceTno,This had nothing to do with slender Man there were like 2 shots of him
ySy8mcceTno,Scariest part of the trailer is the SONY logo.
ySy8mcceTno,"The forest, you must not enter, the “man”, you pray not to encounter, “he”will bring horrifying torment, and then your inevitable, terrifying end."
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be the best movie 🍿
ySy8mcceTno,This is the origin of the dead man in the suicide Forest XD 😁
ySy8mcceTno,I don't like it
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah, wonderful. A movie people wanted in 2012, presented to us 6 years too late."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks promising *But the memes will be better than the movie*
ySy8mcceTno,ｔｈｉｓ　ｋｉｎｄａ　ｉｒｒｉｔａｔｅｓ　ｍｅ
ySy8mcceTno,"Movie company known for shitty cashgrabs? Check.

Icon of a fandom that is toxic and everyone has avoided for the past decade? Check.

Bye Bye Man 2.0? Check.

What could go right?



Also, you can name every cliché in the book with just this trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,*he's coming for you...*
ySy8mcceTno,Asquerosamente se llenará de Pendejos :'^ así como paso con It ay...
ySy8mcceTno,Wouldn't have minded if it was animated...
ySy8mcceTno,The movie Gabe showed everyone in The Office is more scarier than this 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing I can think of is idubbbz Gangnam style
ySy8mcceTno,Why did they choose now to make one? The popularity for this myth rose up in 2012 and died out in 2014 and most of us were most likely asking for a movie then but why now is it being made?
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul Is so proud!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 7 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,omg😱
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that this is a actual movie scares the crap out of me
ySy8mcceTno,When ves que va a salir una película de slenderman but los creadores de emoji movie :'v
ySy8mcceTno,😰😰😰😨😨😨😓😓😓
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no
ySy8mcceTno,"Reflecting on the girls that killed they’re friend for “slender man”  & how the game used to scare me 
💩-less
I for one am not really interested in this movie. 😅"
ySy8mcceTno,Where its the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora Si Viene Lo Chido.
ySy8mcceTno,I really want them to make a movie about the Attract Mode creepypasta. One of the best creepypastas I ever read.
ySy8mcceTno,LOGAN PAUL IN THE WOODS - Official Trailer (HD)
ySy8mcceTno,"Waiting..........



(For memes)"
ySy8mcceTno,"it looks like it will contain the entity known as slender man, but not the actual story of slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,I can smell the memes now
ySy8mcceTno,You can see logan @ 2:40
ySy8mcceTno,I'm afraid this won't be a good movie but if IT was good 2017 them maybe this will be good to.
ySy8mcceTno,No offense it’s just I can’t trust trailers now a Days until I see it on tv cuz there has been to many fake trailers
ySy8mcceTno,"I was really interested to see what they would do with this idea and so far it looks like crap. The trailer is mostly incoherent and doesn't really tell of anything of a story, it's just a hodge podge of scenes that someone thought might be scary to some people.  Eh, it's just an initial trailer and that doesn't really mean anything... yet."
ySy8mcceTno,"I have been waiting for a movie of Slenderman for a long time now..... But, I'm having some mixed feelings about this."
ySy8mcceTno,Except Slenderman is one word. I would know.
ySy8mcceTno,Boy this looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,"1. Oh, so we now think it's a good idea to release a trailer for this only after the girls involved in the ""incident"" in Wisconsin have been convicted? One would think that the Wisconsin incident would generate more backlash, seeing that it happened only four years ago.

2. Okay, you get brownie points for not featuring any established symbolism in the trailer (namely the Operator symbol). How about we try to keep it out of the actual film?

3. Yay, it's not found footage! At least it won't be a BLATANT ripoff of Marble Hornets. And hopefully it will be more respectful of established lore than Always Watching.

4. Thank god that the trailer doesn't give us any more story than we would already be able to guess simply based off the premise of Slender Man slendering. Or whatever it is that he does. 

5. Yay, the most direct threat to the characters is themselves, and Slender Man isn't just used as a placeholder for a much more generic monster role. 

6. If none of these characters cough or have seizures in the first act, I will be disappointed.

7. For numerous reasons, I hope that admission isn't much more than $20. Props to people who actually get that."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a poor movie but I will see cuz I love Slendy :3
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie has some interesting ideas, children seeing the Slenderman, leading them to madness, leading them to cutting their eyes out. Very creepy cool stuff. However this was just a bad trailer. Mostly just action shots of the woods and trees. We hardly see what the Slenderman does or even looks like. Like does he drive the kids insane or do they go missing? Again it's a cool idea and I'm happy we're getting this film, though this trailer isn't doing it for me. At this rate I'm not going to be rushing to the theater to see this on day one. Seems more like a film I'd go see with a friend if we both don't have anything else to do. Hopefully they step it up with the next trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,Def wouldn’t waste money to see this in theaters lol might watch it on firestick night not
ySy8mcceTno,mm.. my childhood fear becoming a movie 👌😤 *_this game was literally made so long ago_*
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for the memes for this
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good although it'll probably get bad reviews and be like M or R
ySy8mcceTno,"I have mixed feelings about that.
Why not use the original font? Why not use a story that is similar to the creepypasta? Why would you do a movie where slender is fast? I'm waiting"
ySy8mcceTno,THIS IS REAL?!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,YES WHEN THIS MOVIE DROPS I NEED TO SEE IT SLENDER MAN IS MY FAVOURITE
ySy8mcceTno,Figured someone would make a movie on this crap at some point
ySy8mcceTno,im not sure how to feel about this film considering that slenderman was originally a creepypasta on the internet meant to scare kids.... but ok
ySy8mcceTno,"It better not be disappointed than ""Super Mario Bros"""
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man..the next IT
ySy8mcceTno,jeff the killer is next bet
ySy8mcceTno,"(5 days later) 
Sony: it's a prank"
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one that's somewhat disappointed that they're taking something that already has a culture and stories and even a video game and turning it into just a freaking movie.
ySy8mcceTno,The scariest part in the trailler is how shes writting with the marker also i bet this is going to be one of those where it only shows slender man for 5 minutes
ySy8mcceTno,Sony can u at least make a Popeye movie either animation or not
ySy8mcceTno,#AndroMobileKing
ySy8mcceTno,Slendermans main thing is not possessing people u should have people stuck in the woods with him kinda like Blair witch except maybe the parents go looking for there daughter instead of a documentary.
ySy8mcceTno,OH NO. I..I..I see somthing coming also....a big pile of steaming dogshit of a horror movie!!
ySy8mcceTno,Lol this is so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Türkler like atinda bizde izleyeceğiz belli olsun
ySy8mcceTno,"Plot twist: Slender Man is actually just a cop who doesn't play by the rules, and these scenes are just him having a quick snack at the beginning of the film. The majority of the movie will actually be him fighting terrorists and trying to keep the Chief from firing him for eating all those kids."
ySy8mcceTno,No es lo que esparaba
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the movie Sony keep it up
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for it to come out
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!! LONG LIVING GAME DESERVES MOVIE!!
ySy8mcceTno,looks lame
ySy8mcceTno,i dont think so sonny
ySy8mcceTno,"Everyone else can make jokes and say this is bad, but I for one am glad that it is being made into a movie. I am not picky when it comes to moves and like to go in not being bias and thinking it isn't so bad, and Honestly I think the movie looks great."
ySy8mcceTno,"Bueno, solo se demoraron unos 5 años xd"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG! They made a movie and slenderman! Yes! I have been waiting forever!!
ySy8mcceTno,I DON'T see slender man ? 😑😑
ySy8mcceTno,This isn’t really base on slender
ySy8mcceTno,de seguro sera mierda la peli
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like the ring
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve muy mala :(

ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap did I wake up in 2014?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,Sony needs to be stopped.
ySy8mcceTno,Cringed
ySy8mcceTno,"From the trailer it looks like it's good, or will at least be decent enough to pay for.

But it's 5 years too late.

It's arguable that they had it in the works a couple years ago, but halted due to the incident where the girls stabbed their friend for Slenderman.

But in my opinion they still should've released it, for the paranoia value"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG......
ySy8mcceTno,"i never thought i'd see the day this happened, i mean a movie about a creepy pasta? i didn't see this coming."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally Another Movie On My Guy Slendy
ySy8mcceTno,"So a girl goes missing in the woods because of Slender Man and they need to fight him back, or something?"
ySy8mcceTno,The memes are rife in this comment section.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope to God they have atleast one pewdiepie call back
ySy8mcceTno,"All the people saying ""This came out too late"" don't seem to understand that if this movie came out 5 years ago like you're suggesting that would of been EXTREMELY disrespectful to the stabbing victim and her family, smh."
ySy8mcceTno,"ok,i am not going to watch this"
ySy8mcceTno,I didn’t like this trailer... it didn’t include Taylor Swift...
ySy8mcceTno,They filmed a part of this in my neighborhood
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man doesn’t even come out
ySy8mcceTno,Boooooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,I don't find this scary at all....

ySy8mcceTno,NOOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,I see Sony is using the internet for movie ideas
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it's going to be an average movie
ySy8mcceTno,Sony about to make a slender man vs spiderman next
ySy8mcceTno,Alguien que hable español
ySy8mcceTno,I really want to watch that movie right now.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this Stranger things season 3
ySy8mcceTno,Looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man isnt a monster...more like an entity. So stop with the growling. The thing that makes him scary is that hes sneaky. You cant hear him. And all the maggots and nasty things, dont add anything to the movie. In fact they kill the whole vibe."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man 2018: taking an internet meme 5 years old and makeing a crappy   generic movie

ySy8mcceTno,"Whoa, Slender Man is so cool and popular, and relevant ! (Sorry if this comment is posted late, I'm using internet explorer)"
ySy8mcceTno,I think he's just misunderstood. Maybe he's searching for a friend? Everyone needs friends. Even Slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,"There's already a Slenderman movie called ""always watching"""
ySy8mcceTno,But
ySy8mcceTno,I am not frightened)
ySy8mcceTno,Es una mierda. Es la mierda más grande que he visto en toda mi vida.
ySy8mcceTno,"Whoever directed this clearly didn't understand Slenderman is scary enough as is, without the addition of tired horror tropes like maggots, self-harm and whatever the hell mythos bending hollywood cliche they're forcing into this"
ySy8mcceTno,Wait...is this real life?? Are they really making a movie!?
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be bad
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul You Better Watch Out Slenderman is coming for you boi
ySy8mcceTno,The first parts of this movie looks like a remake of stranger things

ySy8mcceTno,i see a really bad movie
ySy8mcceTno,That scare me 😱😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😱😱!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"The moment I saw ""SONY"" I knew it would suck beyond human levels. It looks like a student film with a big budget. And to think that usually trailers are better than the movie because they have all the good scenes in them. If the trailer was that bad, imagine the actual movie."
ySy8mcceTno,...would be better.
ySy8mcceTno,A 63000 jef the killer no les gusto el video

ySy8mcceTno,"Was ready to rip this apart ...
BUT IT LOOKS GOOD!! tho' lil long a PERFECT TRAILER too: no dialogue but uses sound AND it doesn't give a generic  plot away involving a curse or a Freddy Krueger type out for Revenge  etc... but instead uses Beautiful Ambiguity...the hallmark of ANY good horror flick. Hopefully it will stick to the rule of:
 ""what COULD be behind the door is scarier than what IS"".   -Alfred Hitchcock"
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late guy
ySy8mcceTno,MA MA MA MAINCRAH!

ySy8mcceTno,"Childhood dreams,,,,,are coming true,,,,,,,yes please bless you Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,When the trailer was horrifying till 2:03..
ySy8mcceTno,#HIM
ySy8mcceTno,Sony made it and they're half a decade late to a trend. This is going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like some kind of edgy horror art festival film where they DON'T show you the monster, or it's subtle cause they didn't have the budget for it."
ySy8mcceTno,"It's a wierd trailer, I dont know what to think. They spoiled everything, but also nothing. And there is not much 'Slender Man' in the trailer, wich is bad and good."
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer movie seria mais legal
ySy8mcceTno,k
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch this and hope that there will be a sequel for more memes
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so wack and so try hard wtf #notmyslenderman

ySy8mcceTno,Coming in 2022... Fidget Spinner the Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Yaaayyyy
ySy8mcceTno,Sony still have not learn their lesson
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait!
ySy8mcceTno,I want a Jeff the killer movie instead
ySy8mcceTno,They should make a funny movie bout slenderman and it should be about when it’s animated instead and slender mans nice but everyone’s afraid of him and the only sad part would be when he tells the sad story of how he lost his face to the only person who’s slender mans friend.
ySy8mcceTno,Dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Looks so good
ySy8mcceTno,This is not as scary as I expected

ySy8mcceTno,I want this movie
ySy8mcceTno,What garbage ! As if kids are not messed up enough these days.
ySy8mcceTno,"Basically has no relation to the games besides from Slender, pages and maybe characters"
ySy8mcceTno,They runnied it at the end
ySy8mcceTno,"Let me give you a hint,    ...they will drag u up before their courts to give an explanation that fits in with their crappy agenda.... don't fret nor worry!!!  for what's about to pop out of your cranial cave in response to them....they shall not be able to respond to you.....classic!!!!   lololol   roflmao.   true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Lol it looks funny not scary
ySy8mcceTno,Please no jump scares im in bed its 12:33am
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wow 4 years passed and their finally making a *high budget* film of Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"I have one word for this movie







Really"
ySy8mcceTno,I hate the forest 🌳 now !...
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm its look very creepy but I understand nothing
ySy8mcceTno,but why though
ySy8mcceTno,The best part of this are the coments
ySy8mcceTno,"No one asked for this, maybe four years ago but it's to late. Just stop"
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting so long for this...
ySy8mcceTno,"Why can he posses kids now. He never did that, that’s like saying Superman gained the ability to have telekinesis"
ySy8mcceTno,"This would’ve been a good movie in 2013.....
This looks dumb asf"
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know. Slender Man is a great horror character and it really needs some justice after +200 awful games. I like how this trailer has at least some mystery, but i hope it's not another generic horror (it probably will be, but still)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Really i dont Know the creppy tale but this looks like the old Ring, hope it not."
ySy8mcceTno,"Black girl? Well the, black blood it is."
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things 3
ySy8mcceTno,We must show this to poiised
ySy8mcceTno,The Movie is Not creppy
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmm I sense the ring 4
ySy8mcceTno,I guess it doesn't look.. Too bad.. I'll watch it
ySy8mcceTno,"Visually this looks impressive, but I'm not to sure about the concept. However, if this movie's plot is based on the actual murder that took place between three little girls in the woods... then I'm in."
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like Sony needs to be put on suicide watch.
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks like there is definitely a reoccuring eye theme. We see needles going into an eye twice, we see pictures on the wall of slenderman taking out a girls eye and a girl crying blood, we also see a girl stab a scalpel in her eye, and the #canyouseehim kinda adds to that. Now i kinda hope this isnt true but my best speculation is that hes trying to create more ""slendermen"" or maybe followers? Because of his signature lack of face"
ySy8mcceTno,Is anybody still scared of the slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,cant wait for Eric Knudsen to sue this shitmovie
ySy8mcceTno,Can see all the shitty reviews already
ySy8mcceTno,really?.. slender man started in like 2009 and now we're getting a trailer?... sad
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this the worst trailer I ever see when it comes out I will see all and my opinion about it
ySy8mcceTno,Ok why not...
ySy8mcceTno,"friends it seems that the have made up a weird story ON THERE OWN without the game creator and if the game creator was here than this means we play as a girl? in the game and if ""slender man"" caches you he basically mentally touchers  you until suicide interesting."
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve played the games of slender man so I want to see this
ySy8mcceTno,people still care 'bout slender man WTF ??
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLLYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,"seven years too late, go back to being a barely disturbing creepypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,MARBLE HORNETS WHERE ARE YOU
ySy8mcceTno,That's.... Early
ySy8mcceTno,#icanseehim
ySy8mcceTno,I am so seeing this movie
ySy8mcceTno,the guy in the woods is Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,well slendee man know the instant transmition
ySy8mcceTno,slEndEr DAdDY FAnaRt CoMinG tHis YEAr
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,*I read it SPIDERMAN and clicked it* got Clickbaited
ySy8mcceTno,good job Sony I'll be watching this Movie..
ySy8mcceTno,#IDontFuckingSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,The 1st creepypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is an old game but it looks scary now
ySy8mcceTno,wait really?
ySy8mcceTno,A tad too late there Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, about 5 years late"
ySy8mcceTno,This is footage of logan pauls career lingering in da woods hehe
ySy8mcceTno,"Low budget, or just low quality in general?"
ySy8mcceTno,There are people who genuinely believe that they have been attacked by the slender man. I wonder if this is gonna be based on a true story or not?
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like PURE garbage...
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch this film
ySy8mcceTno,Concrete giraffes sure has changed
ySy8mcceTno,"Movie of the year





2011"
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s pewdiepie?
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly think that Always Watching will outrank this. I liked Always Watching due to the fact it included Marble Hornets. I feel like this is just gonna be really shitty. Also why is there a space between slender and man.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why don't they just show that video of the black thing jumping the kid in his hallway, shots waaaay scarier"
ySy8mcceTno,hollywood has run out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"you're uhh, a few years late sony"
ySy8mcceTno,What a wasted opportunity to open a non gender fast food chain.....they blew it.
ySy8mcceTno,Alot of creepy pastas would actually make for some interesting horror films. Hopefully this won't be as bad as it looks. I loved slenderman 😢
ySy8mcceTno,#NotMySlenderMan
ySy8mcceTno,who else thought that it was Spider-Man trailer 😒😂
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul would love that forest
ySy8mcceTno,"Um, why?"
ySy8mcceTno,"0:40

Why couldn’t I be here during the game?"
ySy8mcceTno,the most haunting part of this video is the sound of marker against the board oh my goddddd
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/GWAJouEAetE
ySy8mcceTno,I read it spider man. 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Finally after decades of waiting
ySy8mcceTno,This is way too late Sony!!!!! Should have done this 6 years ago!!!
ySy8mcceTno,He just looks like a dementor
ySy8mcceTno,Meme Rating: 9/10 looks promising.
ySy8mcceTno,"Just toss it in with the test of the garbage. Nothing to see here, just played out horror tropes."
ySy8mcceTno,And that girl died because she assumed slenders gender and “it” got triggered
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 when you outta stamina on friday the 13th and see Jason pulling up on you
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is confirmed ninja god
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer look like its scary but real talk when the movie come out theres only gon be jumpscares like anabelle
ySy8mcceTno,Now i can die happy...
ySy8mcceTno,Dear god... I can see the memes now.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol what?
ySy8mcceTno,if this wasn't made by sony it might be decent. warner bros. where u at ?
ySy8mcceTno,1:55 WUT???!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh wow a slenderman movie 3 years after the game/it is irrelevant, interesting stuff there..."
ySy8mcceTno,This better be a Slender The Arrival movie
ySy8mcceTno,What a horrible cheesy trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Well it's just the trailer gotta see it first but dang ig here's the  emoji movie's big brother.
ySy8mcceTno,it was a great horror game..please dont ruin up the game by this movie
ySy8mcceTno,The thing I’m hoping it does is connect with the original slender game and slender the arrival and it’s not just a remake or something new
ySy8mcceTno,O cazzo
ySy8mcceTno,"the first official creepypasta movie, what will be next? :O"
ySy8mcceTno,"So, the movie is called Slender man but the actual Slender man only appears for 2 or 3 seconds?
Kind of disappointing"
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this movie is a blend of Jaws and the Babadook but still stays true to the Slender Man roots. I say Jaws because what made that movie effective was that the shark was rarely fully seen, but whenever he did appear it was a scene that you wouldn't forget. I say the Babadook because that movie was a great psychological thriller that fucked with your mind and made you go ""wtf"". I want the same with Slender Man. Yes, make him seen but not too often otherwise it doesn't make when he does show up special. And give us something that would make us leave the theater mind-fucked with the movie we've just seen."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm here because I read the title as 'SPIDER MAN'.........😒😒😒
ySy8mcceTno,And why aren’t they collecting them 8 notes
ySy8mcceTno,I guess this could be scary but slender man never appealed scary to me
ySy8mcceTno,I read spider man... xd
ySy8mcceTno,Wow! Now it's a major motion pictures!
ySy8mcceTno,why does it look like such garbage?
ySy8mcceTno,Most generic trailer of 2018 already
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman is the peak of fitness
Skinny fast/teleporting(no Olympics for you) handsome(he has no face....)"
ySy8mcceTno,About time. I mean ik there was another movie but I expect this one to be better
ySy8mcceTno,Frick did it have to be Massachusetts?
ySy8mcceTno,"NO WAY 
THE BEST
THING HAS
HAPPENED TO
ME !!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Years too late!
ySy8mcceTno,Lol what is this slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Not since the Mario Bros movie have i seen something this terrifying.
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't suppose Mr. Wagner, Sutton, or DeLage are involved, seeing as they essentially breathed life into the story to begin with? I'm gonna assume ""no"" since Sony is involved and none of the imagery here is actually Slender Man related."
ySy8mcceTno,O MY GOD FINALY
ySy8mcceTno,I’m pretty sure he still just wants his $20
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que o filme seja bom.
ySy8mcceTno,"um...anyone else know that there's already a slender man movie? I man yea this one looks like it could be coop,but just wanted to put that out there....the name of the movie is always watching.."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there's gonna be a page collecting part and also scenes with the video camera....jst like in the game..
ySy8mcceTno,Brandon Ingram
ySy8mcceTno,Ay no pinches mames!!
ySy8mcceTno,"""People just don't disappear"", neither does he ...."
ySy8mcceTno,Trash.
ySy8mcceTno,The Candle Cove series sucked and this doesn't look any better. It's a shame.
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepypasta fans: ""FINALLY!!!!"" 
 Tbh...... I want a whole universe for all my creepypastas (especially Jeff, he's one of my favorites... He's one of the classics)"
ySy8mcceTno,Throback to 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Dosnt look like slendy is in it that much.... just as a spirit in the mind or something.... so it might be good... like how Halloween 3 was the best Halloween movie out of the series and Michael wasnt in it... so maybe this movie will be good if it was more thriller than sleder
ySy8mcceTno,laaaaate train
ySy8mcceTno,The game looks scarier than the movie
ySy8mcceTno,YO OMG FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,"Director: what movie should we do this about?
Ideas:
Saw; Nah taken.
Little Evil; Netflix Copyrights
Final Destination; Already taken
It; We don't need lawsuit of crazy clowns
Umm let's open the creepy pasta website and pick one at random"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg Adoroh!
ySy8mcceTno,It now seems like John Cena now has a competitor😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Im the only one who laughs during horror movies... mainly the classics like Friday The 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre... I laugh at the clichès in the movies like the hide from the killer, turn, and then hes in your face"
ySy8mcceTno,We don't need this
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to watch this movie. It must be very scary
ySy8mcceTno,#iwanttoseehimhowlongdoyouthunkivebeentrying
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know about anyone else but I want to see this
ySy8mcceTno,I understand
ySy8mcceTno,This can be really bad or genius
ySy8mcceTno,Striking when the iron is hot once again soney
ySy8mcceTno,You are pretty late sony.
ySy8mcceTno,No creí estar vivo para cuando llegara este día :''v
ySy8mcceTno,This would have made so much more money if someone thought of makin this in 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,"When that girl wrote HIM, I thought that she was going to write ""Hi Mark."" from The Room."
ySy8mcceTno,"i gotta be honest, i quite like this"
ySy8mcceTno,Is he John Cena?
ySy8mcceTno,It's happening?!
ySy8mcceTno,Es muy mala.  Me hace acordar a los monstruos de la película de los niños peculiares
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,feels like courage the cowardly dog. there is an everpresent being that is a monster and he needs to be put back to where it came from
ySy8mcceTno,He doesn’t look very slender
ySy8mcceTno,*_Dont_*
ySy8mcceTno,Gay elephant noise at 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,next thing you know there gonna make a movie about all of the creepy pastas origins 😂😂😂😊
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder what ancient internet trend Hollywood will turn into a cash grab next?
ySy8mcceTno,"This couldn't have been made in 2012 when Slenderman was all the rage? This looks like a Ring rip off. Psychological horror, oh jou"
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next? A horror movie of Zelda?
ySy8mcceTno,Deberán poner a varios loquenderos en los créditos
ySy8mcceTno,nice😈
ySy8mcceTno,oh!!!
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER CAME SPLENDID
ySy8mcceTno,Don't watch this at night 😵😵😵😵😵😵
ySy8mcceTno,They should make a Slenferman vs Jeff the killer film
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's more mystery and suspense than horror.
ySy8mcceTno,Llegas tarde..... 15 años tarde >:v
ySy8mcceTno,I’m sorry but this looks like a hot mess
ySy8mcceTno,"Mmm, another generic horror movie made of cheap jumpscares"
ySy8mcceTno,What if slender man is real? It could hunt us down..
ySy8mcceTno,He's coming for ya bootyhole.
ySy8mcceTno,"I swear to god it better not be trees trees trees trees , slender is known to warp in front of his victims not fucking mind control and invisible."
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,"If this were announced in 2012, I might have been excited.

What could freaking Hollywood, of all things, do to add to the already tired story of Slenderman?"
ySy8mcceTno,Quando estreia o filme ?
ySy8mcceTno,Yus? This could be a hoax. This is not a real movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Ma che é sta boiata?
ySy8mcceTno,that really slenders my mans.
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't be hyped for this, this movie will just include every single cliche of a horror movie and add the slender man theme to it."
ySy8mcceTno,"Me seeing it: ITSHAPPENING.gif
Me seeing it's made by Sony: OhNO.gif"
ySy8mcceTno,"W A T ? 
why not 5 years ago as a fun little horror movie with cheap scares like the kind of thing you'd watch with your friends on Halloween."
ySy8mcceTno,sony just searched up what are kids into today and came up a 2012 article and found slenderman on it
ySy8mcceTno,Oh look an old meme
ySy8mcceTno,Flop
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os BR?
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow this is actually a movie someone chose to make, well, with such garbage as the emoji movie I really shouldn't be surprised."
ySy8mcceTno,me?nah i never heard that thing
ySy8mcceTno,I think this video is fake
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this shyte trending in India???  😒🤔🙄
ySy8mcceTno,My names Jeff
ySy8mcceTno,"for people saying how ""late"" this is, you probably have failed to realize that the sentencing of the two girls responsible in the ""Slender Man stabbing"" (however fucking stupid and ridiculous that was) in 2014 was just finalized last week of December 2017. so technically.. it's still relevant."
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch this when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,eee boy!)
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it has to be Sony who are the people making this movie
ySy8mcceTno,She turned around and looked at him there's no hope for her after that
ySy8mcceTno,ok but why
ySy8mcceTno,Quando esce!! !!
ySy8mcceTno,This character has always been a great idea for a movie but eh I dont know what to think of this. Too little too late maybe. Or maybe its just me thinking Slenderman has been beaten to death imo. Has potential though.
ySy8mcceTno,This should of been out years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't get too hyped about slender man, look what sony did to the emoji movie"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALY!
ySy8mcceTno,Nigga you like 3 years late
ySy8mcceTno,*Bring out the Creepy Pasta's*
ySy8mcceTno,Well I can’t say I’m not interested.
ySy8mcceTno,is this movie coming soon?
ySy8mcceTno,"Memes, memes everywhere."
ySy8mcceTno,"0:43 Hey, it's my fanart wall!"
ySy8mcceTno,"I enjoy the way how it looks like that the makers went back to the slender man notes and the girl missing in the forest but I am not a fan of how slender man is a virus that affects the mind, I wish they would do more on the physics of slender man and how he defies the act moving a distance without sacrificing time or energy. Also about the history of slender man such as the countless children missing episodes caused over the time. Something like Sinister 2 but with the same story as this and better than thats shyte!"
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good fanfiction
ySy8mcceTno,Nearly a decade late
ySy8mcceTno,no way
ySy8mcceTno,01:26 me after watching this tralier
ySy8mcceTno,"I really hope they don't mess this up. Hopefully, it'll be like the marble hornets way of slenderman. Like with the proxies and mystery and what not."
ySy8mcceTno,Who remember John Cena after watching this ?
ySy8mcceTno,no
ySy8mcceTno,cringe af
ySy8mcceTno,This is it. He won. He will come for us all.
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Jeff The Killer?
ySy8mcceTno,I can smell the low rotten tomatoes score from here
ySy8mcceTno,"i can already tell the movies with contain 1 hour and a half of plot, twists and bullshit crying and running. But we will only the man for like 5 minutes or not even."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to see the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Also the creators of the EMOJI MOVIE are bringing slender man back. Man, i wounder how the news is going to react after the slender man stabbing incident!
edit: also the girl screaming on the bed seriously reminds me of when 11 from stranger things was screaming to not be isolated and alone in her cell in that testing facility. Nice one movie!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Umm... Marbel Hornets? The 8 Pages? The Arrival? The fact that you don't know what happens after he gets you, so death isn't confirmed because proxies like Kate? Late to the show Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,About 4 years late....
ySy8mcceTno,I just watched the trailer to Truth or Dare. I saw this and i believe this deserves more publicity so congrats on 8th trending and congrats to the Creepypasta community for getting credit in a new horror movie!
ySy8mcceTno,I'm going to be optimistic and say I'm exited to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Who else thought “wtf why is it so quiet”...
ySy8mcceTno,"I say this knowing full well I can (hopefully) be proven wrong: this honestly looks very poorly made. Like trailers are suppose give you some idea for the film (as well as ruin the film most of the time, but that’s beside the point). 

This trailer shows nothing. It gives me idea that it has scare baits in it, poorly written characters, confusing and poorly directed scenes and not cohesive at all."
ySy8mcceTno,Pues ya es oficial shavos
ySy8mcceTno,It's gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Oooooohh
ySy8mcceTno,"niceee .. 

i like the style .. atleast"
ySy8mcceTno,They do slender man but not five nights at freddys. Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it would be a bit like the game where slenderman is an actual person but in this case it’s just a mental disease
ySy8mcceTno,So now they’re making a movie from reddit page??whats next a horror movie based on loot boxes
ySy8mcceTno,slowpoke Sony
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was 2018 not 2012
ySy8mcceTno,i thought this was fake or fan made until i saw the publisher
ySy8mcceTno,Would've preferred it to be more like Blair witch.
ySy8mcceTno,"You guys don’t know how to appreciate something. First of all, movies take a long time so maybe they are late, but at least they made a movie on it! For whom? For us! The audience. And they spent money, time and work and effort to put up a film just to entertain and hype us. And it’s just the teaser not the actual trailer. Humanity is slowly walking towards negativity, people have stopped praising things and instead just criticise. I won’t write more. Thank you."
ySy8mcceTno,I read it as spider man
ySy8mcceTno,"please tell me this is a joke.
Sony,  stop making movies out of dead fads! I'm getting worried!"
ySy8mcceTno,This is so different from the game and story... I'm disappointed in Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,7 years too late the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"If you don't know how to make a trailer is, how have you made a movie with it?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I think the most disappointing part about this movie is that it’s probably going to get most of its scares from gore or gross out like so many new horror films. It’s a shame because Slender Man has so much potential to be absolutely terrifying. A movie about Slender Man doesn’t need gore. He’s scary because he is ominous, quiet and makes people disappear. He’s a subject of terror, not of the gross-out genre. A proper Slender Man film needs intense build up, like that of The Shining. Sucks that Hollywood is gonna take the potential such a terrifying creature has and turn it into another gross-out film."
ySy8mcceTno,Pleasantly surprised at how decent this looks.  Needs more slendy though.
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this....
ySy8mcceTno,An yet again another horrid movie on a game.
ySy8mcceTno,It's the boss!
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone else having trouble with the YouTube app? Video playing for 5 seconds then stops.
Also, does anyone know how to fix it?"
ySy8mcceTno,Meme reviews 👏👏👏
ySy8mcceTno,Show this to me 5 years ago and I would be super excited. But I'll still check this out.
ySy8mcceTno,Not even over-done at all
ySy8mcceTno,"Not really sure what to think of this, other than it didn't really look anything like the game(s) or anything remotely like a true Slenderman movie should, in my opinion. Too many unknowns, way too many characters, and honestly... not enough Slender. Sounds like this is just another lame horror movie from this decade, falling into the sea of below average horror films."
ySy8mcceTno,So where are the tide pods my dudes?
ySy8mcceTno,The new Marbles Hornets looks pretty good
ySy8mcceTno,O they did not just turn this game that used to give me nightmares like 2 years ago into a movie ...
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fr??!
ySy8mcceTno,"it’s been 5 years





5 long years"
ySy8mcceTno,"It cant be that bad





RIGHT."
ySy8mcceTno,Why god why??????
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender...
its 2018 not 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,Y el cabezon blanco de slenderman donde esta? XD llevaba años sin oir el nombre de Slenderman xD
ySy8mcceTno,"lol wtf this might actually be good, looks like they have taken their time and not rushed out and made some shitty cash grab of a film. Im intrigued"
ySy8mcceTno,"I hate to say it and I hope I'm wrong but this looks terrible. I feel like there are two types of people that would make a Slender Man movie. One: someone that realizes how big of a cultural phenomenon he was and would be very meticulous in trying to meet our high expectations of an on screen representation. And two: some opportunist that's wondering, ""how has no one made a movie about this guy yet?"" Seeing it as an easy payday. ...I think we got the latter"
ySy8mcceTno,I love Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,If pewdiepie would make a cameo in this
ySy8mcceTno,"Lets just hope for once, its a good movie based on a video game thats based off a creepy pasta"
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabron! cagala y te mato >:v
ySy8mcceTno,I wish I was still a slender man geek. Well whatcha gonna do
ySy8mcceTno,It shows wayyyyy to many shock scenes in the movie. I feel that like there’s nothing left to see now.
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was Spider-Man
ySy8mcceTno,Bullshit
ySy8mcceTno,Oh dear god what the hell.....it actually doesn’t look that bad.
ySy8mcceTno,bruv we already had one of these give us the long awaited fnaf
ySy8mcceTno,This is fake 😐😐😐 correct me if im wrong
ySy8mcceTno,They are now just making a movie on Slender Man? I feel like everyone's interest in Slender Man was like 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,They're about 6 years too late lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Most anticipated movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,cant be worse than the new insideous
ySy8mcceTno,Like si la vas a ver. xd
ySy8mcceTno,I don't wanna look at worms having a seizure lol
ySy8mcceTno,Only 90s kids know slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,4 years too late ive grown up
ySy8mcceTno,"Really, Sony? Now ripping off THE HAPPENING?!
I don’t even like horror films, but... ARE YOU SERIOUS?!"
ySy8mcceTno,so she transforms?
ySy8mcceTno,But..... why?
ySy8mcceTno,The people killing themselves are Logan Paul approved and I think thats pretty scary
ySy8mcceTno,I seriously can't believe there making a slender man film. Considering that slender man is pure fiction and was a YouTube creation. The slender man hype died out years ago. It's sad to say but the only reason there making this film is to cash in on the slendermsn murders.
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie is going to be terrible and cringey
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting for CLOROX BLEACH to comment
ySy8mcceTno,I hope we all know slenderman isnt real
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not sure how I feel about this




Although I can't wait for the memes that this movie will inevitably birth"
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul must be Slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Se acordaron tarde... Hay trailers fanmade mejores que este y, ¿DONDE MIERDA ESTA EL CANON DEL CREEPYPASTA? ¿DONDE MIERDA ESTAN LOS PROXYS? 
NADA VA A SER MEJOR QUE MARBLE HORNETS!!"
ySy8mcceTno,No way a slender man movie can be good. This trailer sure is though.
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul will find them in the forest don't worry
ySy8mcceTno,looks so good! cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,Here we have a video meme
ySy8mcceTno,The writer must've been frozen 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Eh look! It’s... SlenderBOI
ySy8mcceTno,$50 bucks it's gonna be shitty
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? An FNAF movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Nice
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next Jeff the Killer?
ySy8mcceTno,Why....is this trash even
ySy8mcceTno,OVV MY GODDDDD
ySy8mcceTno,*Sony the retarded shithole of a company..are at it again*
ySy8mcceTno,"Super late, but itll be good... Hopefully."
ySy8mcceTno,"So I have known about slender man since 2013, and they are just now making a movie??"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh great, another jumpscare parade."
ySy8mcceTno,well this looks really shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,THINN slender boi
ySy8mcceTno,EXCITED!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I thought Spiderman
ySy8mcceTno,You all are about a century late to feed off the slender man craze....
ySy8mcceTno,Awww hell naw
ySy8mcceTno,Interesting trailer. Hyped for this film.
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to fail so badly. Who in the world is scared of slenderman. Oh wait 8yr olds
ySy8mcceTno,Im scared more at how the plot is going to pan out than slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This is real?
ySy8mcceTno,Horror movies are so desperate to make me scared but you know what? *I don't watch Horror Movies!*
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this a comedy film? Well ""comedy""."
ySy8mcceTno,Gore and jumpscares. I like this new idea on horror movies
ySy8mcceTno,I think Sony just invented meme necrophilia. They are shamelessly raping that dead meme. The body wasn't even warm still.
ySy8mcceTno,Es tarde 15 años tarde :p
ySy8mcceTno,I've been wanting a slenderman film but goddamn it would be nice if it was made when he was still relevant
ySy8mcceTno,WHY TF AM I WATCHING THIS AT 3:55 IN THE MORNING!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm sorry, but this is not that great of an adaptation... This movie looks horrible. They got so much wrong here. I'd even say the got the Slender Man wrong. He's a slender (hehe) man with a black suit and red tie and no face. How, just HOW do you screw that up? The reason I say that is that we never see it. Sure, he's surrounded in fog, but we're still able to see i (although, slightly) How in the world could you get that wrong?! XD"
ySy8mcceTno,"Great....they're gonna ruin slenderman just like the fangirls! Next thing you know Sony is gonna make a Jeff the killer movie,then Ben drowned,oh!and laughing jack! Just go ahead and ruin all of them just like the fanbase did!"
ySy8mcceTno,There is already a slender Man movie
ySy8mcceTno,place output increasingly plenty vessel joint confront good.
ySy8mcceTno,BELLA FAVI
ySy8mcceTno,This just looks like a ring ripoff
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it will end up being painfully generic
ySy8mcceTno,Ring rip-off?
ySy8mcceTno,Okay? So um can anyone explain what the story is about. I obviously know it’s about slender man but like? What about the plot? It just seems like it has not story and it’s just s bunch of girls trying to get away from slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"*Es tarde,15 años tarde.jpg xdxdxd :v*"
ySy8mcceTno,What about the notes u have to find to survive
ySy8mcceTno,creepspy
ySy8mcceTno,If the Exorcist were bad…
ySy8mcceTno,It's the meme movie money maker 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Keep things in the past. don't bring it back smh
ySy8mcceTno,"Sleenderman is about kidnapped kids, *no about suicide teenegers* (lol). I mean, it doesn't need be SO FREAKING EDGY to do a good horror movie 'bout Sleenderman."
ySy8mcceTno,wheres my scp containment breach movie
ySy8mcceTno,And it all came from a picture online ^_^
ySy8mcceTno,Please make some real horror movie!
ySy8mcceTno,So Your gonna make a movie based off a game and  COMPLETELY make a whole new story line for the movie when there was already one for the Game ~ How retarded can you get
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys just read the description, it looks like it was written by a first grader"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally someone decided to make a slender man movie but I don't know about sony making it. Like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,Очередное говно
ySy8mcceTno,This literally was popular like 5 years ago 😂 why make a movie for it now??
ySy8mcceTno,How many Ring movies are they gonna make?
ySy8mcceTno,Now we wait for the amnesia dark decent movie staring pewdiepie coming out in 2069
ySy8mcceTno,#icanseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Oppa gangnam style! Op op op op oppa gangnam style! Ight now gotta flush and put on my chapstick cause it's 7 A.M. brb ttyl :)
ySy8mcceTno,Boy lads this looks absolutely bloody like every other shite horror movie that's come out in the past ten years dun it?
ySy8mcceTno,This could have been good... At least I still have IT 2 to look forward to.
ySy8mcceTno,O yea ohcos ejaldo wual ufuefeufeesufueosas *TRATANDO DE HABLAR INGLES
ySy8mcceTno,Do you need To find 8 papers  in the forest
ySy8mcceTno,Your 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,What creepypasta is next 😏
ySy8mcceTno,Idk the full story of Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Im gonna ignore being late about 4 years on the Slender trend, but this genuinely looks terrible."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow 1 day 3million viewers
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t get the trailer at all
ySy8mcceTno,"no, stop.

I was kind of happy when i saw this wasnt going to be found footage, but for gods sake dont turn slender into another jumpscare monster. for him to work, you need a slow, well paced movie not dedicated to getting jump or shock horror, but existential dread and tension."
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like Slender Man is only gonna show up in the last 10 minutes of the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god what if this revives the fandom
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully it’s not a fan made
ySy8mcceTno,I cannot wait
ySy8mcceTno,Based on a true story
ySy8mcceTno,Yes!!!! I've been waiting!!!!!!!! 💯💯💯💯
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like something oats studios would make
ySy8mcceTno,The internet will hate on anything smh. I’m actually excited to see this because it looks like the first well done/high budget movie about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,I can alreay tell that it’s going to be one of those movies that’s only going to show Slender man like 4 times in the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,OH HELL TO THE YEAHHH
ySy8mcceTno,Il mio prof di matematica fa più paura
ySy8mcceTno,Whelp this is the first meme of 2018😟
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman hasn't been scary or relevant to the internet since 2011. No disrespect to that girl who was killed by two dumbass edgy teenage girls who actually fell into the internet's garbage and believed that Slenderman was real.
ySy8mcceTno,It's weird as hell and intriguing but the story isn't told that well which is the negative.
ySy8mcceTno,Shall Slender Man finally lift the curse on poor movies based on video games?
ySy8mcceTno,like 9 years too late kids todat wont even know him
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, is it already time for Hollywood to ruin another video game movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,I am HIGHLY skeptical BUT there is hope that this wont be a joke
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is the type of Company that takes all the bad ideas so others don’t make any bad films!
ySy8mcceTno,Why do this 5 years after this was relevant?
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood sucks. This is the ring. Unoriginal.
ySy8mcceTno,El bastardo volvió
ySy8mcceTno,Can you make Bendy and  the Ink Machine Movie
ySy8mcceTno,First movie without Marvel's tag ...
ySy8mcceTno,"im a creepypasta addict and i know alot about it so...
1. slender sickness doesnt make you suicidal it makes you drawn closer to Slender
2. this movie is gonna trigger the Creepypasta Fandom cuz its to stereotypical of Slender
3. Sony movies always suck"
ySy8mcceTno,The Slender Rings....
ySy8mcceTno,Whatever happened to collecting the 8 pages?
ySy8mcceTno,"You guys know that the dude who popularized this thing with Marble Hornets already has his sequel, eckvanet, running for free here on YouTube right? Why would I pay to watch a second rate Hollywood version of a series that on no budget and done with no obligation for the viewer to pay runs circles around it?"
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe that they are actually gonna make a movie about a Creepypasta character! Maybe they would make a movie about Jeff The Killer next.
ySy8mcceTno,"Taking a breath...

ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman movie: ""oh no""
Made by sony: ""oh dear god please no"""
ySy8mcceTno,Algún latino?
ySy8mcceTno,You're a bit late
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm just gonna come out and say it. It looks decent. Not a masterpiece,  but decent"
ySy8mcceTno,Stick man meme confirmed
ySy8mcceTno,Are these people behind the film losing their minds altogether already?!
ySy8mcceTno,"I can already tell this going to be terrible the level of edge...
Preview alone gave me a papercut."
ySy8mcceTno,Fake
ySy8mcceTno,This is a fucking thing?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this battletoads?
ySy8mcceTno,";w; they’re completely ruining slenderman. I wish it was just like the games. I would’ve been fine with something close to the quality of Blair witch, but they have to turn it into some evil crap and act like the kids are possessed. I just want a regular horror movie where the kids go missing and someone is stuck in the woods searching for slenderman, not gore and possession."
ySy8mcceTno,They’re only 7 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Im pretty sure at the end the girl with the bloody mouth is holding her tongue. It seems like it makes sense.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks corny as heck 😪
ySy8mcceTno,99% of  video game movies suck this could change it or not
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,dang they couldnt wait for bith girls to get sentenc  before coming out this  movie i know all the parents must be hurt reliving this
ySy8mcceTno,when i saw the picture i thought it was spider man XD
ySy8mcceTno,"""Slender Man""         *Lights up cigar*      ""I never heard that name in years"""
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to the comment section you may hide here as long as you’d like

but most importantly



he come bacc"
ySy8mcceTno,Espero de que no la caguen como death note .
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next fnaf?







*wait*"
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing I don't like about it is that it's not off the real story to it like the game u don't get the same feeling if you understand what I mean
ySy8mcceTno,So the tales are true. There is going to be a Slender Man movie. Blows me away when it was one of the hottest games that came out. Now it grew into something more.
ySy8mcceTno,I really don't understand the direction this is going in
ySy8mcceTno,It's gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,"Not going to lie, I had completely forgotten about slender man at this point, trust Sony to think that it was a great idea to make a film about a meme that’s been dead for 5+ years."
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY CREEPY PASTA I LOVE YOU SONY!!!  can you please do Jeff the killer next? 😍😝💖
ySy8mcceTno,HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA FIRST THE EMOJI MOVIE AND NOW THIS? KEEP IT UP SONY... 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,""" Top 10 anime sequels """
ySy8mcceTno,Cool 😎
ySy8mcceTno,Who got scared and just went down to the comments?
ySy8mcceTno,"Yup, based on the trailer, the HBO documentary will be a better film than this one."
ySy8mcceTno,"The scariest part was the baby laughs. I can't watch horror films, and this is pitiful."
ySy8mcceTno,this comment section is full of butthurt assholes who never even played this game but just watched (mostly pewdiepie) youtubers play it...
ySy8mcceTno,"Probably gonna get fired down by people because it doesn't look nowhere close to the original slender man plot or story.
In my expectations it's gonna be a pretty cool movie but not gonna get good reviews because it didn't follow the original story of spooky slender boi, there may be another story of slender man I never heard of but this doesn't look like the slender man I know."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dumb and cheaply made
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, or you could just walk out of the woods."
ySy8mcceTno,"Ohhhhhhhh snap this movie is!!!...








Probably gonna suck..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry guys, it's hard to take this trailer seriously without thinking of Slender Man fan art..."
ySy8mcceTno,Wake me when they make Salamander man.
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would win? Thousands of people with shooty bois, or one skinny boi"
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if this will be considered part of the Slender Man Mythos or if it will be something else like Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Mmm.... Slenda’ man lookin’ like a whole snack
ySy8mcceTno,Let's see if this one is worthy...
ySy8mcceTno,"No lo c rick,parece falso ;u  despues de 6 añosporfin :""u"
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m pretty sure slender man’s living in a retirement home by now, playing chess and knitting sweaters."
ySy8mcceTno,ya kiero que salga
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger Things season 3 looks great
ySy8mcceTno,Not sure if this was said already but how people died in the games i wonder would it be like the ring movies if you see him you get fucked up and die in a crazy way.i wish they could do that but critics would say its a rip off of ring movies..
ySy8mcceTno,*This is like Sony’s answer to Netflix’s Deathnote*
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger Things vibes
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,Han pasado 84 años xd
ySy8mcceTno,The ring remake with slender man in it haha
ySy8mcceTno,Ummm ill wait for the DVD
ySy8mcceTno,What will be next ? SCP Containment Breach ?
ySy8mcceTno,Yay
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the letters on the trees? Slenderman isn't only in forest he also resides in buildings. I feel like they just read a creepy pasta that a 5 year ond fandom worshipper wrote... GG
ySy8mcceTno,Neat...
ySy8mcceTno,"jaja esta peli solo estara de moda :v , muchos estan como omg¡ pero no saben nada sobre esto¡ nisiquiera sobre las creepypastas y dices que coño¡? nisiquiera sabes quien es slender man y mucho menos sabes que son las creepypastas ? :v jaja pero bueno chao ;v"
ySy8mcceTno,This is so familiar af
ySy8mcceTno,"I wonder if I'm the only one who has watched the other slender man movie ""Always Watching"" it was low budget but still effective, chilling and done right. Hopefully this will be done too."
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is the 4thmovie
ySy8mcceTno,Why are they making this movie now and not 6 years ago when the game was popular? I'm confused
ySy8mcceTno,"After this movie you know they're gonna make one out of the rest, it's going to be a Creepypasta Year with Slender Man being the first of it."
ySy8mcceTno,"“Why?”
-Sad Dunkey (2017)"
ySy8mcceTno,WTF who he going to scare anorexic man
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called  they want there game back.
ySy8mcceTno,We need and scp movie or series
ySy8mcceTno,Did that girl really stab herself with a scalpel? Oh heck no
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve epica
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy, can't wait for the other badly done movies based off creepypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,"This has the potential to be done right, if it's presented as a type of psychological horror. Like, imagine if it keeps Slendy in the dark and builds up the possibility that he might not actually be real, but just like the two girls that stabbed their friend in ''his name'' internet addicts hook on to a passing trend and try to make him real.
That'd be some nice commentary on human extremes and just how suggestable we are. And it's twice as scary when you realize this has and can happen.
Sadly, I am expecting just another monster movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't look half bad.
ySy8mcceTno,Ducking trash
ySy8mcceTno,¿Y si será narrada con Loquendo?
ySy8mcceTno,They were off by like 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,you can't fucking be serious
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul the man in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,Watching this late at night in my bed and something outside my bedroom just fell... guess who won’t be sleeping tonight 🙋🏻‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,why is this trending on the music category?
ySy8mcceTno,What kind of anime is this
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer could be better bruv.. Hopefully the movie is really good
ySy8mcceTno,so the girl is the sally chick?
ySy8mcceTno,"Not to sound offensive, but this isn't going to have the girl who got stabbed 19 times is it? I hope not, cause that'd be fucked up."
ySy8mcceTno,missed out on a slender man gangnam style opportunity if you ask me
ySy8mcceTno,This looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,"3 things wrong with this trailer.


#1 I don’t think many people care about slender man anymore so you guys are very late.

#2 Slender sickness draws people to Slenderman it doesnt make them commit suicide like this trailer suggests.

#3 This is made by Sony. The people who made The Emoji Movie. Nuff said"
ySy8mcceTno,Am i the only one thinking that a camera recording and some static sound would work great at 1:41???
ySy8mcceTno,"It's just like when I was a kid. All the kids at school would talk about scooby doo and I didn't know wth that was about. When my poor family could finally afford cable, I was like, ""Hey, scooby doo?"" My friends was like, ""that was a long time ago. but yeah, scooby dooby doo!"". He was nice enough to pretend it was still the metro."
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yeah
ySy8mcceTno,"what do you get when you do something after its been dead for the last five years

ySy8mcceTno,Halloween 2018 please!!!!!!!!!

ySy8mcceTno,What's next? A Jeff the killer movie? Hollywood is running out of ideas...
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji movie now this bs
ySy8mcceTno,Sony this was a really really good idea.... 4 years ago 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Dahmit another forest video
ySy8mcceTno,This isnt even what slender man is
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the club penguin and five nights at Freddy's movies
ySy8mcceTno,Just stop
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be the biggest movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I heard about this and I thought it was fake
ySy8mcceTno,FINNALY!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Just 5 or so years late
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn't look anything like what it should be. It's a not a fucking virus lmfao, if your gonna make a movie about Slender man at least look upon the content created by other people and including the game"
ySy8mcceTno,markiplier can beat slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Really
ySy8mcceTno,No! You can't see Slenderman with a naked eye! This is why I hate American horror films! They don't follow lore!
ySy8mcceTno,How To: Allow the Creepypasta Fandom Outside of their Basements and Into the Movie Theatre
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you better not screw this up.
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait the pewdiepie review 😃😃
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it was coming after that attempted murder.
ySy8mcceTno,Last time i heard slenderman i was still in kindergartden
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would win?
Several people including a trained team of police officers 

OR

One Twiggy Boi"
ySy8mcceTno,And jeff the killer ?
ySy8mcceTno,Ok i have know idea what is going on in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Milking a dead story, little late Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"very lovecraftian. I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE USE LOVECRAFTIAN ELEMENT CORRECTLY. the characters descending into madness, unseen/undescribable monster, unexplained happening. IM GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW."
ySy8mcceTno,"Hell yeah. For everybody that’s saying “Oh it’s 5 years too late. Oh it’s made by Sony. Blah blah blah”, if you don’t want to see the movie then don’t go see it but can you please take your toxicity somewhere else. No one has time for that negativity."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm getting a stranger things vibe from this even tho slender was created first
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t believe that there is going to be a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,s l i m  t h i c c
ySy8mcceTno,maths are bed
ySy8mcceTno,trigonometry is mathematics

ySy8mcceTno,gay is a sin

ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, they want their movie back"
ySy8mcceTno,"I was scared of the slender man when I was 16, not so much as a 20 year old now"
ySy8mcceTno,creepypasta fans are quaking
ySy8mcceTno,Weak sauce
ySy8mcceTno,I think this is extremely poor taste after what happened to that 12 year old girl a couple of years ago. Imagine trying to get over the trauma of being stabbed because of this character and finding out they're making a movie based on him. Poor poor taste.
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, the most anticipated movie of 2011"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh. Always Watching A Marble Hornets Story was better
ySy8mcceTno,La verdad viendo bien el trailer se ve que la peli va esta bien vergas
ySy8mcceTno,It's made by Sony so you shouldn't expect much
ySy8mcceTno,"Just another throwaway, forgettable, pandering Sony “film.”"
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY THEY'RE MAKING THE MOVIE!?!!!!!!?!!😤😠
ySy8mcceTno,"I think the movie is mainly meant for people who DOESN'T know who Slender Man is...

Basically people who don't watch YouTube a lot...

Like us...👍"
ySy8mcceTno,The movie trailer looks like it has almost no affiliation with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow looks like a ring reboot, just give us another marvel hornets, I enjoyed the first movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Showing up to the party fashionably late
ySy8mcceTno,12.30 pm y yo viendo estos trailers soy leyenda jj
ySy8mcceTno,Uhhh...this going to be PG13. So you know this movie is weak as hell.
ySy8mcceTno,Yea this movie is gonna take a big L
ySy8mcceTno,most anticipated movie of 2011!
ySy8mcceTno,😑.................................................
ySy8mcceTno,this gives me goosebumps in a bad way...
ySy8mcceTno,"If this is what an actual ""live action"" adaptation movie made by Sony looks like... then , why- I think i'm thankful that the ""Sonic"" live action movie jumped off the boat to a better studio just in time!"
ySy8mcceTno,*TRASH*
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah.......stop trying to bring the dead back to life, please."
ySy8mcceTno,I truly hope this movie makes me piss myself
ySy8mcceTno,Let's wait some years... and then they're going to make Slender vs. Freddy
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the real deal!? Is this the real movie!
ySy8mcceTno,SlenderMan isn't even in here
ySy8mcceTno,"Horror Movies in 2018 be like: ""hey it's Hollywood. We runnin out of ideas""😂👌🏻"
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"You have got to admit it, it has big potential, then again they have gotten a lot of thing wrong about slender man. I guess they did have to change some things but the changes seem fine. I think big fans will have to give it a chance and imagine it as a new form of slender man I guess. What do you think?"
ySy8mcceTno,Every movie copied from a game has been a major let-down
ySy8mcceTno,ew
ySy8mcceTno,Good. Now we need a Jeff The Killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"No se uds, pero creo que este tipo de películas si que abarata el cine de jolleywood actual"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this is good
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly I rather American horror story do a season of slender man then this but I’m still going to watch the movie let’s hope it’s better then the trailer makes it look.
ySy8mcceTno,la quiero ver
ySy8mcceTno,tthis is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG I LUV THIS IM SEEING THIS
ySy8mcceTno,It's been like 6 years since Spiderman was so you where a little bit late
ySy8mcceTno,Produced by Internet Explorer
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t they make a short film of this on yt but they better make this movie good and not some foolishness but then again this has 89% chance of it being bad
ySy8mcceTno,"sony that story is sucks. You need make story from ""Slender The Arrival"""
ySy8mcceTno,The Grudge is a better Slender Man than this..

ySy8mcceTno,Cool. Can't wait to watch it.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman, Slenderman
Does whatever a Slender can"
ySy8mcceTno,I just watched this and i regret it I though since this is the first slender man movie 🎥 but this looks so fake and not even good I am not planing on watching it what so ever
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted to see a screenplay adaptation of that game ....5 years ago. Still cool that they finally are doing something with slender man. That game used to m scare the piss out of me.
ySy8mcceTno,No stinking way
ySy8mcceTno,"0:50 for a second I heard ""Markiplier"" there. I guess I just subconsiously linked the two things together..."
ySy8mcceTno,gon be one of those that yall go to cuz you played the game but turned out to be trash
ySy8mcceTno,Finally I’ve been waiting for this
ySy8mcceTno,Eh. Unimpressed.
ySy8mcceTno,The creepy pasta and video game gets a movie? YAY
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell no!😳😤
ySy8mcceTno,I can see the memes for this movie incoming already lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Wouldn't it be amazing if all the fan made slender story creators came together to make a official movie such as marble hornets and others
ySy8mcceTno,lol this trailer was put together so poorly
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm calling it, this movie's gonna be a flop."
ySy8mcceTno,"People complaining about them “being late” honestly need to shut up. How do you expect this movie to have been released when Slender Man was viral? Like it takes years to make a movie. Secondly, the whole slender man stabbing In 2014 would’ve caused too much controversy, so I think the timing for this is still right. Secondly, people complaining about them “not getting the story” right also really need to shut up. The only somewhat origin story we’ve gotten to Slender Man is by Marble Hornets, and this movie is NOT connected to Marble Hornets in any way, thus it gives us a new introduction and new story to Slender Man."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman 

*Takes drag from cigarette*

I haven't heard that name in years"
ySy8mcceTno,LOGAN PAUL enough said.
ySy8mcceTno,Holy crap there barley making this movie its 2018 for crying out load
ySy8mcceTno,"You're only like 6 years too late. Lmao, this movie is going to be a blunder, what a joke!"
ySy8mcceTno,ياااا فرحتي اخيرا شي للكريبي باستا والله منتظره يجيبون شي عنه يااااي شكررررا 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛
ySy8mcceTno,kui ngomong ngopoh
ySy8mcceTno,Years to late and they will spoil the fun that it once was
ySy8mcceTno,DUDE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO MANY YEARS IM QUAKING. IMAGINE THE DUDE WHO MADE THIS REACTION WHEN HE FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Five Night's at Fredy's?
ySy8mcceTno,Also will this be on Netflix?
ySy8mcceTno,looks fanmade
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I freaked out cause I swear I predicted the future. I downloaded the Slenderman game in late 2017 and I said what if the trailer came out next year for a movie 😂 I’m freaking our
ySy8mcceTno,I kind of have hope. But a Sony movie isn't good news.
ySy8mcceTno,This Is patetic :v 
ySy8mcceTno,I do wonder how they're gonna pull this off well. The dude wears a tuxedo so how the heck are they gonna work with that for a proper horror movie?
ySy8mcceTno,nope
ySy8mcceTno,hablen en español
ySy8mcceTno,Woooow this is true 💕💕💕
ySy8mcceTno,Thought Sony would learn from their mistakes after the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,I came here for the gay elephant noise.
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"For more of it....just tap SEARCH button and type in 'C-Roc'    and/or
'Return Of'da HedBanga'"
ySy8mcceTno,"1st time watching: isnt really feeling it

After re-watching: i actually cant wait to see this lol"
ySy8mcceTno,They chose to make a slender man movie over minesweeper Jesus.
ySy8mcceTno,lf this movie turns out good then I'll want movies for all the creepypastas.
ySy8mcceTno,Woah...
ySy8mcceTno,NO WAY I HAVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS
ySy8mcceTno,"I could’ve named 3 games that’d make better movies. Slenderman isn’t scary only a bit creepy, this movie should be considered a thriller, not a horror movie. This movie would’ve done way better back in 2010 when Slenderman was a trending game."
ySy8mcceTno,habla  2009 quiere que le devuelvas sus creepypastas :v
ySy8mcceTno,No way
ySy8mcceTno,"First off, you're a little late to the party. Second, why the hell would you just now decide to make a movie about a creepypasta character that was relevant to people that aren't preteens on tumblr about four years ago and a while after the whole incident with those two girls and their friend!?"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so excited
ySy8mcceTno,It would be cool if they put some Marble Hornets into it. Ya know like Hoodie or Masky
ySy8mcceTno,"All these slender enthusiasts lol 
Nerdalert"
ySy8mcceTno,es una mierda no tiene nada que ver con las cosas que muestran con eslender man
ySy8mcceTno,"WTF ya se viene lo bueno del terror :)




PD: quede perturbada pero me gusto y no puedo esperar a verla XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s his Tuxedo?
ySy8mcceTno,hey gamers stu here
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t look scary  but depressing. Just looks likes  bad situations over and over again. What happened to classic horror?
ySy8mcceTno,De una creppypasta a una película 😁
ySy8mcceTno,This is basically just Stranger Things season 1.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m freaking ready for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Sony done Fucked up
ySy8mcceTno,"You sure this isn't an SCP 106 movie? The music, the going through walls, and the black stuff seems like that."
ySy8mcceTno,WOAH
ySy8mcceTno,After people pooing there pants you want a creepy pasta come to life for death
ySy8mcceTno,I bet the creepy pasta Fandom is happy right now
ySy8mcceTno,Maggots at the beginning ugh disgusting
ySy8mcceTno,Yer fuckin L8 m8.
ySy8mcceTno,I only seen one Fram where slender man is in other its just maggots
ySy8mcceTno,Why the hell it take this long to make a Slender Man movie and then you go and make it look more like a possession movie than an actual Slender Man movie????
ySy8mcceTno,Like si eres mexicano
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t look good
ySy8mcceTno,OMG ny móvil
ySy8mcceTno,"let's just hope that it lives up to the games. Unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen. Just looking at the trailer it's obvious that they didn't take much inspiration from the source material, I may be wrong but what I'm getting from the trailer is that slender man assumed to be the hallucinations of a mental patient. If they just go with a similar story to the game ""Slender the Arrival"" they'd get a more familiar story. Maybe if they went with one or two people finding themselves lost  in a certain area of forest that they were tramping in or researching because of people going missing or folklore of supernatural sightings. They can't find their way out and are forced to camp for the night. In the night the unusual becomes usual and they are forced to protect themselves. They discover some clues as to what the creature is and begin to refer to refer to it as the Slender Man. I'm going to leave the rest open to ideas. This is only my personal opinion and what ""I"" think would be cool, so keep the hate at minimal."
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, sh2t. I thought it was a trailer for Spider-man...After 10 secs...nope..nope..hell no"
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es real!?
ySy8mcceTno,Probably one of the better fan-made trailers I’ve seen.
ySy8mcceTno,"I WAITED YEARS FOR THIS AND THIS IS WHAT U GIVE ME?!?!? U GOT THE WHOLE STORY WRONG AND ITS NOT A VIRUS, EVEN A SMALL YOUTUBE CHANNEL WITH 20k COULD DO A BETTER JOB"
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly this is a disgrace to Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,HAHAHAHA DERP HAHA
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a.....BAD MOVIE!
ySy8mcceTno,About godamn time
ySy8mcceTno,TRASHHHHH
ySy8mcceTno,wow i bet it took you 30 mins to make it
ySy8mcceTno,I think their making this movie to possiby remind people how Slender man was a huge thing years back.
ySy8mcceTno,"When I was in the 6TH GRADE, what made Slenderman scary was how it wasn’t extreme and in your face. It was paranoia. It was looking out the car window late at night on your way home and thinking if you looked close enough you would see him there. It was quiet. It was walking into a dimly lit large public bathroom and thinking he was in one of the stalls. It was something being there in the corner of your eye alone in your house at 12am. It was the fear of BEING afraid because the more aware of him you are and the more he was in your head, the more likely he would get you. I was terrified, and even though I was little it was pretty ridiculous even then to be so irrationally scared of a creature you read about on the internet. 1:41 was the only part in this trailer that almost caught that, but you could get the same thing in a game you play on the computer. I hope the movie does better than what the trailer has to show but the tone seems wayyy off."
ySy8mcceTno,"A few things I wanted to point out

>""can you see him"" is the catch of the movie, multiple cuts of Staring at the forest, which is what makes him so freaky, he's hard to spot, but he's always there. One of the best things about marble hornets was searching for him in the background of dialogue scenes. When hornets started doing tighter more action paced baloney, that's when it wasn't scary. 

>He's out there watching, and he only gets closer every time you look away so you shouldn't be looking in the first place, BUT HES THERE HOW CAN YOU NOT LOOK

>the scariest thing about him is the feeds on your obsession of having to know. Humans are the most afraid when they think they are in the dark, unknown YOU HAVE TO LOOK

>eventually this usually turns to drawings in slenderman plots, but it's a good thing, it conveys the obsession. 

>I don't know if you noticed guys but last shot you can't see where her arms end.... ;)

Sonys got this"
ySy8mcceTno,HYPED BOIS
ySy8mcceTno,"You only get to see Slender Man once in this trailer, only for a second. The rest of the trailer consists of the most stupid logic I've ever seen

The slender sickness is supposed to draw victims to Slender Man, not make them suicide, The original slender man with a red tie and black tuxedo and white skin has been replaced with a naked, fully dark skinned figure and a whole lot of other crap...

Not to mention Sony is very very late to capitalise on slender man...

Did the director do any research or did she/he just throw together a bunch of crap to make money?"
ySy8mcceTno,This just reminds me of the girls trying to kill her friends that they stabbed 19 times in the  chest
ySy8mcceTno,A little late to the party there Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,OOF
ySy8mcceTno,he's just there to offer you his sales pitch..
ySy8mcceTno,pinche raza yo subí mi respectiva crepipasta de Slenderman hace 6 años y no me pusieron en los títulos
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't necessarily look like an actual movie. It looks like a well-made YouTube short film
ySy8mcceTno,If you bet me 9 million dollars to go see this movie ha NO!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Alright. I have high hopes for this movie, Slenderman is definitively my favorite creepypasta.

However, if you never showed the words ""SLENDER MAN"" I never would have guessed that this was a movie about slendy.

I think that a movie about slender man can have great potential as a horror film, but I feel like this is a step in the wrong direction.

Slenderman, virus, [surgical] cutting. I never felt that thise went together like this. I mean a plot similar to Slender: the arrival would work very well.

However, I'm a kind of stubborn 14 year old kid. What do I know? Maybe I don't feel good about this because the movie doesn't follow my idea of slender.

Anyways, this has potential, but is really easy to completely F up.

Good luck, sony"
ySy8mcceTno,Why is no one talking about (presumably) Slender struggling to open a door at 1:13?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks poopy
ySy8mcceTno,"Boss: after the failure of the Emoji Movie, we need something that will be great.

Worker 1: lel how bout slenderman movie

whole room except boss: Laughs 

Boss (Thinking): yo that's a great idea"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, that looks pretty good"
ySy8mcceTno,Ohh Hell No
ySy8mcceTno,"No wifin in da club
GIMME 20 DOLLAZ"
ySy8mcceTno,5 years late..
ySy8mcceTno,Look like the ring
ySy8mcceTno,if they've completed the game theirselves they can find the papers eZ
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry my mans this looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,"I am both hyped.... and scared. I'm happy that this is going to happen, but.... I fear that they are going to twist and warp the image of slender man. Let's just hope that they include original material. Either way, I'm still gonna watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,Isnt this like 5 years late? Isn’t everyone over this?😂
ySy8mcceTno,Screw whoever thought of this can you imagine what that family feels like watching this who had their little girl stabbed over and over
ySy8mcceTno,They should have totally made Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,The kid in the hospital bed who goes nuts. And the aides show up. Reminds me too much of a Halloween film from the 80s
ySy8mcceTno,wadu hek?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ooooo que wuen vidio, la dvd me dieron ganas de comer maruchitan y ve la peliii :v
Viva el niño dios :v"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys go to my sickkk youtube channel to watch my LIVE reaction
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna be trash i already know
ySy8mcceTno,Im down to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer makes it look pretty awful.
ySy8mcceTno,And it all began with the something awful forums and then the games...
ySy8mcceTno,"Well this looks like generic horror movie/ ring ripoff #173638. There using slender man to cash in on the recognized name, but honestly I seemed like every other forgettable horror movie of the last few years."
ySy8mcceTno,Why all the dislikes ?
ySy8mcceTno,No sabía que iba a salir algo así =v
ySy8mcceTno,Next year we better be seeing a squidward suicide movie
ySy8mcceTno,3/10 Needs more SLENDER MAN
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be weird and TRASH
ySy8mcceTno,I'm asking why are they in a forest? But gotta say very creepy
ySy8mcceTno,I will wait for it to come out on red box.. it might be worth the 1.29 🍻👻
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,HE STICC AF
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,"The one time you could've done a shaky camera movie with it being 100% justified and you don't do it, THE ONE TIME!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting for much too long, this looks good too"
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Herobrine ?
ySy8mcceTno,"One of the scariest video games, is now being turned into a motion picture. I like it..."
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been a great movie 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman? I thought this was 2018 not actually 2013. Not only are you guys too late but also Slenderman isn't scary anymore and this clearly shows you guys are running out of ideas. Oh and nice bringing back the whole story about him so the next generation of kids can go and try to kill their friend to try and sacrifice her to slendy.
ySy8mcceTno,Pretty late tbh
ySy8mcceTno,I was waiting this movie since 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,I was too scraped to put this full screen
ySy8mcceTno,Lol tbh i dont see a plot wtf
ySy8mcceTno,I want a spoder men movie
ySy8mcceTno,I heard a couple of sound effects from the Ring movie in this trailer. And saw a couple visual effects too.
ySy8mcceTno,Calling it. It’s going to flop.
ySy8mcceTno,"screen gem + sony?

best match for crappy film."
ySy8mcceTno,Of course Sony would make this...
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all want a scary Slender Man movie just look up Marble Hornets on YouTube. Thank me later
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like it would be a good movie if it didn't rely on a creepypasta for publicity. Seriously, they're putting expectations at an impossible height by making this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Out in ?
ySy8mcceTno,Sony needs to stop with its shitty movies
ySy8mcceTno,IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😭😭😭😏
ySy8mcceTno,you are so dumb
ySy8mcceTno,slender man showed up twice in the entire trailer for about three seconds all together
ySy8mcceTno,"i'm the only who's say ""to late my friend"" in 1:45 Xdd?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ooh a trailer grab your popcorn and relax and enjoy the show
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't like the trailer 👎it didn't included lavaboy or sharkgirl
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Evolution :V
ySy8mcceTno,"Slendys not a THICC BOI, dislike."
ySy8mcceTno,"Pero me cuentas la historia y la pelicula completa solo en el trailer... Dame suspenso, vale!"
ySy8mcceTno,No se Rick parese falso -3-
ySy8mcceTno,OMG the real Slenderman movie i waiting this for along time ago
ySy8mcceTno,omg a movie of slendeman ..😆 this gonna be epic !!😋
ySy8mcceTno,Can anyone explain why this movie gets so much hates?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderdick went from terrorizing Grim in GTS wrestling to now being an actor in a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Bad juju...go away
ySy8mcceTno,Por fin ptm 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Noo...encerio al fin podremos ver la película?
Esto no es fake?"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally. It's been about five years now.
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, another cash grab by people who don't even understand the source material, marble hornets did a much better job."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie will be mediocre at best.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie gonna be a jumpscare fest
ySy8mcceTno,Meh...
ySy8mcceTno,"It's 2018, Slenderman became popular at 2013..."
ySy8mcceTno,Legend has it that he still wants your $20
ySy8mcceTno,How many years ago was slender man scary...
ySy8mcceTno,Tentacle porn horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,WHY ARE THEY MAKING THIS
ySy8mcceTno,"""Slender Man the movie""

you kidding me this aint even worth an episode of scooby-doo"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this movie isn't wackman instead of slinderman lol cause I'm tired of these wack scary movies that's been coming out 😠🙄
ySy8mcceTno,"I just know this movie will be bad, I can't remember the last time a good video game movie came out."
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie Five nigths at Fredy's 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony really needs to learn that making something that may be trendy at the time, may not be trendy of few years later. 
Edit: A good 5 years later... -_(\"
ySy8mcceTno,"Epic Epic 







Trailer😂"
ySy8mcceTno,HoLy
ySy8mcceTno,When is this coming!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I like that sony realizes this isn't scary, so they added the eye thing and the maggots to at least gross you out"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh pleeeeeeaaaaaaeeess don't be a shitty movie
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when slenderman was a game? It was good for it’s time
ySy8mcceTno,Where have you been... All this time. We have been waiting for you.
ySy8mcceTno,I think the manga was better
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a bad movie and now sony has ruined another thing for me. Goodbye creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,They should have done the movie while the game was still relevant
ySy8mcceTno,every horror movie is the same nowadays
ySy8mcceTno,"sorry the reflection does not look like slenderman....i'm the idea is already created, stupid if Sony did there own take on it and ruined it."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell to the no
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly thought this creepypasta thing died
ySy8mcceTno,que tipo de groot salvaje es este¿
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the lost thing from 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Woow!!
ySy8mcceTno,"""Following the release of the new trailer 6 stabbing being blamed on the slender man confirmed"""
ySy8mcceTno,Eh
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que esto no sea un sueño uno de los mejores creppypastas adaptado al cine que emoción
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean, Slender man is cool and I love the different types of stories made from the creepypasta. But I don't think this movie is gonna make me happy :|"
ySy8mcceTno,Aw hell no.
ySy8mcceTno,Let's make money off someone's pain...
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm calling it now, Slender Man will be: A, a serial killer using drugs/mushrooms to capture his victims and cause them to hallucinate so they never see his face. B, a super natural creature from some far away land that came to be in this forest by accident. C,  a bacterial infection that causes various mental diseases and hallucinations in the people it comes in contact with. or D, it was all just a bad dream after the missing girl ate off her own hands. What will it not be? A super natural creature that gets mad when you steal his scribble drawings."
ySy8mcceTno,"""Insert logan paul joke cause I'm cool and funny"""
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like my spideysense 🕷 is telling this movie is gonna be another box office failure.
ySy8mcceTno,Im not watching this in theaters. Remember what happened with the conjuring 2 they had to hire a priest to get the demons out of people because the movie was so demonic and horrifying that some viewers got possesed.
ySy8mcceTno,"If this turns into a Cinematic Universe, then make a movie of Laughing Jack


And although it won’t be likely, would Characters like Ben Drowned be included (IF you are gonna make a CU)"
ySy8mcceTno,Probably not appropriate to post here. But Coco movie was soo good.
ySy8mcceTno,2:15 did he finish off inside her mouth or something
ySy8mcceTno,😂😂😂😂😂 se ve super chafa
ySy8mcceTno,Dude! I've been waiting for a Hollywood Slender Man for AGES!!! Dear Hollywood: DON'T. MESS. THIS. UP.
ySy8mcceTno,"What The hell were u thinking this is gonna be terrible.but I’ll still watch.if this is real,I want a amnesia the dark decent"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, don’t waste your time buying tickets... I’m not going to watch it because 

1. I am a fricking ten year old so yeah...

2. I wouldn’t want to, it seems like it’s not gonna be the best... sorry

3. I just saw a movie

4. I don’t like spoopy stuff"
ySy8mcceTno,"It would have been much better if they show the sound of when you the Slender Man is near. I slightly heard it, but it didn't sound effective than the one in the game. Plus, they made this unexpected besides showing the trailer of the FNAF movie."
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when I played the game anyone else?
ySy8mcceTno,Ea: you have to pay 49.99 to increase the duration of net neutrality.
ySy8mcceTno,"Can you hear it?


It's the fangirls, they're coming. (Lowkey hyped for this but still late.)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Once you know, it's already too late..."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this ties in with the games (8 Pages and The Arrival)
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks bad, but what do I know."
ySy8mcceTno,i feel like hoping this would be a decent film is a little too much
ySy8mcceTno,I REMEMBER THE FREAKING RUMORS I HOPE ITS RATED R
ySy8mcceTno,WOW *winks*
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all hating on the fact this this movie isn't completely accurate and doesn't give the plot away. But if you ask me this is how horror movie's trailers should be like.
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know much about Slender Man. Is he Marvel or DC?
ySy8mcceTno,"La he esperado por muchos años...se mi ta malísima 
No lo hagas Sony :/"
ySy8mcceTno,"You know it might be good right papa? Right.... I personally won't pay to watch it, there's a possibility it might be good.... Lots of good movies have terrible trailers right???"
ySy8mcceTno,I sure do hope it doesn't suck.
ySy8mcceTno,Espero y aparescan los proxys
ySy8mcceTno,Too typical. 👎
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated horror movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my god they really made a movie??!!!
ySy8mcceTno,1/10 not enough vore
ySy8mcceTno,This is real or fake???
ySy8mcceTno,No jodaaaas
ySy8mcceTno,"There already was a slender man movie that came out not too long ago (that centered around slender man killing people, not just people going insane and killing themselves) Sony it's okay to be original sometimes, we won't fault you."
ySy8mcceTno,"That's more like zalgo, still sucks"
ySy8mcceTno,"Do I have a problem or is the trailer really dark...





good puns"
ySy8mcceTno,Por fin después de ya hace un buen rato se va a estrenar.👏🏻👊🏻😎
ySy8mcceTno,Get ready for the CREEPYPASTA™ Cinematic ® Universe™™
ySy8mcceTno,I think I'm done with going to the movies if this is what we make for a movie nowadays I'm done...every year movies just get worse and worse everyone definitely remembers emoji movie. Man the movie industry is really dying...
ySy8mcceTno,Give him $20 and he'll leave you alone
ySy8mcceTno,"Nope 
So baaaad movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Erm Hollywood....the hype died 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,slender man is lame. its a shame that producers think this will make ppl come their way.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is in his own horror movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I scared too play it
ySy8mcceTno,When Thick Man
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie should fail, but according to these comments, a lot more people like old, tired garbage more than I thought."
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear Hollywood... Stop. Just, Stop it, why can't you stop doing bad adaptations of good stories GOD DAMMIT"
ySy8mcceTno,"Couple years late 
But it looks crispy"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yo, what is the plot? Hello? All I see is characters getting scared and nothing else. Some gore and others too. What is the basis of this movie? What's the plot?"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wow didn't  see that coming
ySy8mcceTno,Please for the love of god be good
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,Tell me this isn’t real
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope that there is a moment when someone finds a tape recording of Thomas Nealy in the interrogation room. That would add a whole other level of creepiness to this film.
ySy8mcceTno,Pinterest aesthetic
ySy8mcceTno,????????????
ySy8mcceTno,I hate getting old because no matter what movie Hollywood makes it feels like I have already seen it before.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony....



Don't Screw This Up"
ySy8mcceTno,This feels like it'll be a generic horror movie that just uses the name Slenderman as a way of advertising itself.
ySy8mcceTno,Someone thought this would be a good idea and somebody else approved said idea. I think those individuals should be fired yo
ySy8mcceTno,"This would be a great april fools joke, IF IT WAS APRIL"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender didn’t show up once in the trailer. Bruh
ySy8mcceTno,Sony please stop ruining things people like
ySy8mcceTno,"Marble hornets did it first, and much better. Over 5 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,lol wut?
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah madafacker ptos <:V alv xdd sto ya se puso vergah ahre >:v
ySy8mcceTno,This just proves that Hollywood will produce anything these days.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this meant to be about the actual creepy pasta or the real life incident where two girls killed their friend as a sacrifice for slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t believe that OMG!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"About time, you’re late. 
Waiting for fnaf movie though.
Don’t get me wrong I’ve been waiting FOREVER for slender man movie.
Your still REAL late though.
We Barely see Slender man at all in this trailer though.
I’ve been waiting since I was SEVEN for a movie
Now, people pretty much FORGOT about slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone else have that really bad creepy pasta phase in middle school? Yeah, why'd you have to make a movie so I can relive that. I'm having war flashbacks here."
ySy8mcceTno,It’s not scary because slender man is so old and overrated
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else getting emoji movie vibes here
ySy8mcceTno,YES FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A CREEPYPASTA MOVIE !
ySy8mcceTno,No thanks. Haven't you people learned your lesson about video game movies from Assassin's Creed?
ySy8mcceTno,"big posssiblity it is a  bad movie....pale and fake camera...mess cut.....actress sceam for nothing....they wanna make us afraid by only giving some nightmare, i don't think it possible"
ySy8mcceTno,Bye Bye Man 2 Basically
ySy8mcceTno,No poodie pie no deal.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes finally after years of waiting
ySy8mcceTno,You’re a tad late
ySy8mcceTno,The manga was better😤
ySy8mcceTno,“Reads title of video” Aw man just when I thought Pennywise obsession was over now this😪
ySy8mcceTno,I'm still waiting for my five nights at Freddy's movie that was promised.
ySy8mcceTno,..... well....... that's new
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Well i guess it's time to drink bleach again....
ySy8mcceTno,The last SCARY movie i saw was the Others w Nicole Kidman..AND THAT WAS JUST A GHOST STORY. lmfao. Thats how bad Hollywood is..has been. Was a Great film. Great story..SUPERB acting.
ySy8mcceTno,This Trailer is as pointless as Logan Paul's forrest walk. **smh**
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's not disappointing. It looks great.
ySy8mcceTno,All this extra stuff in the trailer shows that this movie is going to do what most horror movies do and give a character with a simple concept a long and filler backstory. They know people are going to watch a Slenderman movie to see slenderman. I'm worried he won't get to show as a paitient boogeyman but rather as a forceful attacker alla Jason in Friday the 13th. Or he's barely shown in an attempt to build up to that jumpstart before the credits that act as his only appearance. But with all the Hollywood does to overcomplicate classic monsters I wouldn't be surprised if the movie explaned Slender as a voodo zombie.
ySy8mcceTno,This can either be really good or really bad  (Hoping its going to be good )
ySy8mcceTno,Im noticing a trend with Sony and mistakes
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly people, save your money and just go watch Marble Hornets. There's a whole sequential playlist, its free, and I bet a kidney this movie will not be anywhere near as good."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg is awesone :3
ySy8mcceTno,This BETTER be good! We’re all getting sick of shitty video game movies. Please try something different.
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things 3
ySy8mcceTno,Booooooooooooooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,My waifu shrek better be in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Alright I just need to say you could of made it more more realistic at the girl scene in the hospital or the girl marker scene is retarded but when the girl stabs her eye that’s realistic.   Make slender super real and make the story and movie perfect like it please unlike the emoji movie or other movies I’m hyped for this more then it and when trailer 2 comes out show slender more.
ySy8mcceTno,wow this a terrible trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Entonces no era una broma de facebook
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 6 years late hahah
ySy8mcceTno,this looksssssssssss horrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Slender Man has come this far
ySy8mcceTno,Never thought of a movie on a game from Android platform
ySy8mcceTno,It looks great!
ySy8mcceTno,Super excited!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,First they canceled popeye over the Emoji Movie now there making a slenderman movie.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG YES FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Right after the trial happens this is released. Too soon.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late for this fam.
ySy8mcceTno,When is it going to be release
ySy8mcceTno,Couple years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Video game with plot: the movie
ySy8mcceTno,What?
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah…you guys are only *cough cough a decade late
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next? A Jeff the killer video?
ySy8mcceTno,#creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,This is all our fault
ySy8mcceTno,"Sooooo, he posses people? From what I know, he just drags helpless kids into the forest and kill them."
ySy8mcceTno,#CREEPYPASTA
ySy8mcceTno,#Creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,From the same studio that brought you the Emoji Movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Not looking good it’s looks like a possession type movie not slender man
ySy8mcceTno,*IM GOING SOME WHERE ELSE UH…………*
ySy8mcceTno,"Hopefully there’s more to it than “slender man steals kids!” Because, as we’ve seen from webseries like Marble Hornets, everymanhybrid and tribetwelve, you can do sooo much more with good ol Slendy than missing kids. Other than that, the trailer looked pretty good, had some cool stuff in it, doesn’t seem to be absolutely filled to the brim with horror cliche’s but they’re definetly still there. I’ll keep an open mind on this one"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna be bad.
ySy8mcceTno,See this isn't how I picture slender man tho. I picture him being a very nice fellow who I would be best friends with if he would ever show his lovely face to me
ySy8mcceTno,You’re a tiny bit late
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting for the fandom to come back now
ySy8mcceTno,I️ wonder if Logan Paul will find this place.
ySy8mcceTno,"This would've been the perfect movie...

5 years ago."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks nothing like the game
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a joke?
ySy8mcceTno,This gave me the chiils
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the Sonic.exe movie! It will be great
ySy8mcceTno,Why hasn’t this happen sooner people
ySy8mcceTno,Is that the suicide forest??
ySy8mcceTno,"1:34 the doki doki liturature club vibes hit me so hard.(if u didnt know, it remined me of yuris death)"
ySy8mcceTno,Eh...
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks abysmal, as expected from a movie called Slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,I swear if this is nothing like the game....
ySy8mcceTno,"Naaa , asi no es el creppypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,"Bland, generic fan film at its best."
ySy8mcceTno,El creador de este personaje se debe estar bañando en billetes :v
ySy8mcceTno,Oh it’s a horror movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I love the booga booga fingers
ySy8mcceTno,"If they made this movie around 2009-2012, then this movie would of been way more exciting."
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 for the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,and.....skip
ySy8mcceTno,Alguien sabe cuando es el estreno de la película pls
ySy8mcceTno,This gives me an American horror story’s vibe
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah i don’t um....think slenderman respekts whamen....
ySy8mcceTno,"My questions is, why you gotta add all this sh*t that weren't in the games? We don't want this, we don't need a back story, just someone trying to escape, maybe two people trying to escape. That's it, don't over do it you'll just make it worse."
ySy8mcceTno,There is an ACTUAL story behind the slenderman meme and a very good one at that. It would be great if the movie was about it.
ySy8mcceTno,4 years... fashionably late.
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman Evolution :,u"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like they didn’t even read on any of the stories of slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Leave slenderman alone he’s been through enough
ySy8mcceTno,Despacito
ySy8mcceTno,Why now why after so long
ySy8mcceTno,so they waited for everyone who played it back then to become 18 before making the movie? wow thats nice
ySy8mcceTno,"This would make a great jump rope rhyme:

""Slenderman: the Movie"" we did make.
How many horror clichés did it take?
Was it one?
Two?
Three?
Four?
Five…"
ySy8mcceTno,Despacito.
ySy8mcceTno,Youre a little bit late
ySy8mcceTno,Whaaaaat 😯
ySy8mcceTno,Of course Sony’s making this
ySy8mcceTno,wow this looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,I thought that we as a culture decided to stop talking about Slenderman after those two girls tried to kill their friend for him
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see a legit fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,Much of this trailer seems like American Horror Story promos it together.
ySy8mcceTno,Boooooo!
ySy8mcceTno,not only are you far too late but we all know this movie is gonna be pretty bad.
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome nice to see movies that aren't just stupud superhero movies that are badly written hopefully the movie will be as good as the games and maybe have a decent plot line or at least be somewhat scary.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman Movie: ""Oh yeah!""
Made by Sony: ""Oh no"""
ySy8mcceTno,"I know this comment won’t change anything in the movie but this is just me wanting to critique the trailer.

Just watched the trailer and thought it looked ok, not great. I believe that is they just made Slender Man silent instead of making him growl it would make the scenes where it stalks/hunts someone a lot creepier. Also, if they showed less of him in scenes, but still showing him it would make him a lot more terrifying. For example, if he was stalking someone they could show some of his shadow on the ground or in the mist making him more ominous. They did okay with that in one of the final scenes of the trailer where the women is hiding behind a tree, but I believe that if they possibly made him a little more transparent it would be creepier."
ySy8mcceTno,Gimme 20 dollars! that song better be in the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,2:15 when you eat her out during her period.
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm getting 'another' vibes...please don't tell me I'm the only one, espicially when the eyes go bleh and suicide in class"
ySy8mcceTno,This just looks like that you replace slender man with any other monster. I want a horror movie where it has to be slender man or else it won't work like always watching!
ySy8mcceTno,AAAAAAAAH
ySy8mcceTno,First make slenderman second make jeff the killer and third make slenderman v Jeff.....good start
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome back to 2013 where every body and there dog knew about the slendy man
ySy8mcceTno,Everybody is commenting about Logan Paul bc everybody is in the trending section.
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer's not terrible, but it could've been better. 
It wasn't horrifying, but it was disturbing enough to be interesting to watch. 

Plus, if this came out at around say, FNAF 3 time it would have been a massive hit on YouTube and possibly the Box Office. 

Overall, good trailer but it was a bit late on its time period."
ySy8mcceTno,Why is slender man all black and has no suit I’m very disappointed and slender man look more like the boogie man just why?
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t see the plot... wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Man!? Did they just assume it's gender!?!? TRIGGERED
ySy8mcceTno,"5 años tarde v"":"
ySy8mcceTno,0:55 into it and I feel like I cannot finish. This has to be a fucking joke!
ySy8mcceTno,"♥️Okay not that I don’t want a Slenderman movie, cuz I really do, but how long has slenderman been a thing and their just now doing a film♠️"
ySy8mcceTno,wow
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,Dumm
ySy8mcceTno,The best part about this movie is that we won't see slenderman at all until the last 10 minutes of the movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm just slightly curious if the 8 pages have any role in this film. Like major plot role not ""oh hay look! A reference!"" Other than that it seems like there trying to go for a hole different approach on the slender Man aspect, Which I'm ok with because slender Man at this point is a skeleton of a dead horse that has been beaten into tiny little shards."
ySy8mcceTno,They made so many video games of slender man now there is a movie😂
ySy8mcceTno,I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going
ySy8mcceTno,About time someone actually made a movie! This idea was floating around for YEARS and no one did anything!
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood has lost all originality.
ySy8mcceTno,NOW you know Hollywood is running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,Now they make a movie about this?!?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,Yesssssssss
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't fucc up and internet classic.
ySy8mcceTno,just tell me whens the jump scare im not going to keep going untill u tell me
ySy8mcceTno,"Basically, slenderman is just a virus, his appearance is just one of he symptoms of the disease ... Yep lol"
ySy8mcceTno,pewdiepie is quaking
ySy8mcceTno,wow thx for making a movie of a dead game
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony  por favor 
NO LA CAGES !!!!!!!! 🙏"
ySy8mcceTno,Great!!!!Another horror film that only gives the MAIN villain 6 seconds of screen time.I mean like............HIS NAMES IN THE FREAKING TITLE!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Late
ySy8mcceTno,expecting something good out of this is about as realistic is expecting something good out of me.
ySy8mcceTno,Logan paul...u know what to do
ySy8mcceTno,"I just have one question 



Splendorman will apear?"
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,Inside the head like a virus?...... No
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are a few years late.
ySy8mcceTno,I never tapped on a video so quickly...
ySy8mcceTno,*I hope the 1% who are seeing this remember to always keep following their dreams. Anything is possible if you set your mind to it!! DREAM BIG! 💫 My dream is to become a successful youtuber  someday. I hope it will become a reality!* 🌟💕
ySy8mcceTno,My favorite Game in movie Yeeey
ySy8mcceTno,"Girl: it gets in your head, like a virus
Fact: viruses don’t get in your head"
ySy8mcceTno,"I was hoping for a slender movie, but this don't really look that good to me"
ySy8mcceTno,"the ring, anyone?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember that I watched a video about slender man when I was little and It made me scared to go outside in the dark. it’s cool that they’re making a movie ab him, not a lot of people know ab slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this directed by Michael Bay
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,This could actually be good
ySy8mcceTno,"The legends of him, then the game, memes, and for the love god, he back in a movie. But your little late, 7 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,This could be so good or this could be so bad
ySy8mcceTno,This is too old slender man is a old creepy pasta so please why's sony?
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this is a bit more than overdue"
ySy8mcceTno,Pfft we already have marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Don't make a movie about me I'm slender
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhhha?!!!????
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, a Sony Animation movie that isn't that shitty! (cough emoji movie cough)"
ySy8mcceTno,Why you do that Why
ySy8mcceTno,Stupid krap..
ySy8mcceTno,I was expecting the jump scares but they still got me  this movie will be great
ySy8mcceTno,Perturbadora AF
ySy8mcceTno,I'm 163528279 approx. years late
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all really trying to bring this back?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no guy's we better be ready for this one
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, uh, there's arriving to a party late, and then there's arriving after everyone else has been dead for five years."
ySy8mcceTno,Another craptastic jump scare fest...can’t wait...🙄
ySy8mcceTno,Demasiado tarde papuh :v
ySy8mcceTno,so none of you believe he is real?? I'm confused as to why everyone thinks this is a joke?
ySy8mcceTno,2018 trailers all the same their all pitch black for like the whole time
ySy8mcceTno,Better be good. I've really wanted to see a good Slender Man movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman was once a game that no one played.


Pewdiepie played that game. The game went popular by his popularity. Now there’s a movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't know why people are shitting on this movie! If it didn't say slenderman people would think it seems like a pretty good horror movie!

It's very cool seeing a monster from the internet be brought to the big screen, besides it's a horror movie......they ain't going for movie of the year, just a fun but scary one!"
ySy8mcceTno,Way too late for this pretty sure the hype for slenderman died in 2012 or earlier
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this for real?? What is it going to be even about? The real life incident with the three girls or just a horror movie?
ySy8mcceTno,High key wish they didn’t put the scalpel classroom scene in the trailer. That really got me 🤢 to be able to react in such a way makes it way better in the theatre. then again horror movies always got to put the most jerking clips in trailers and I’m like… I’d like to save my wtf face for the moment 😒
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't want this to exist, however the trailer looks really promising. We'll see."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man is a Tentacle monster O_O
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks interesting, my only problem is the amount of chaos they're showing Slender Man is causing. Slender was always a stealthy discreet type of entity. Targeting individuals far from everyone else. Having him terrorise an entire town and making his actions noticed by people including the police is seriously breaking his persona. I understand the movie wants to do its own thing but no Slender fan will want to see the movie if they destroy the image of the original character."
ySy8mcceTno,Ni aparese slender man
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late don’t ya think
ySy8mcceTno,We fear what we can't see
ySy8mcceTno,I’m ShiVeriNG RIGht *NOW*
ySy8mcceTno,Lol this looks cute. Where my masky Boi?
ySy8mcceTno,Your making this year's later?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie gives me vibes it looks like nonsense
ySy8mcceTno,What is all this shock value bullshit? Slender Man's specialty was subtle scares not all out gore fests.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es antes o desde de infinity war ?
ySy8mcceTno,First the emoji movie and now T H I S!!! I'll still watch it. Cause it'll probably be better
ySy8mcceTno,I hope slender man is revealed to have an emoji for a face.
ySy8mcceTno,It's probably 6ix9ine taking them kids lowkey
ySy8mcceTno,Now? Like right now. This game was like years ago and I don’t mean to be soft but after that girl got stabbed because he friends did it for slender man I feel like this is just a tiny bit distasteful on her behalf
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah yes, Always Watching by Sony Pictures"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah yes, Always Watching by Sony Pictures"
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be absolute ᴅᴏɢ sʜɪᴛ
ySy8mcceTno,We stray farther from God’s light
ySy8mcceTno,"I was on Reddit when I discovered this. Dis gon be pretty good, unless they $&?! Up like Sea of Monsters (the movie)"
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if they still gonna collect those papers
ySy8mcceTno,"I didn't dig the hype when slender had first started, in fact I loathe that time period because so many shitty games tried to use the ""pick up item"" while wandering about method so many times over it was annoying. I'm glad they took their time to make this, I enjoy a callback to my past years, every one else seems to hate it. I'm hoping this movie will be solid."
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t know why I’m watching this at night. Ok, bye..."
ySy8mcceTno,what is this movie even about? the trailer was abstract and confusing
ySy8mcceTno,"From what's shown here, I'm kind of disappointed it looks more like The Ring than anything else. 
I feel like the movie could've been really good if it was more psychological, like Slender Man was always implied, but never explicitly shown, thus causing a lasting feeling of paranoia. That's just me though.
Not sure how this one is gonna turn out."
ySy8mcceTno,About time...
ySy8mcceTno,This is a nice sequel to the Marble Hornets Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefuly its marbelhornets good
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 OOF
ySy8mcceTno,HELL YA
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay sure, I think Slender Man lends himself pretty well to a horror film. But PLEEEASE, don't even consider making a cinematic universe and have the other cringe inducing creepypasta fandom characters (Ex: Jeff the killer, Jane the killer, Ticci Tobi, Masky). I hate that I know these characters but my sister used to be a fangirl so."
ySy8mcceTno,If they actually followed the source material this could be good but it doesn’t look like it.... no effort at fan service either... just took the name and character and made a basic horror movie from what this trailer shows I mean come on
ySy8mcceTno,Boriiiing
ySy8mcceTno,I already hate it Slender Man doesn't look like Slender Man he looks like a freaking alien
ySy8mcceTno,AHHHHHH ITS 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Did Will Byers get lost in the Upside Down again?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man: I haven’t heard that name in years.
ySy8mcceTno,marblehornets movie anyone??😈
ySy8mcceTno,"THIS IS FAN-MADE, RIGHT? USING STOCK FOOTAGE?
It's not? Dafuq? Go dig through you-tube videos from, what, almost ten years ago, and you'll find stuff that looks way better than this crap. This isn't remotely interesting"
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn’t look that good, could have been better"
ySy8mcceTno,"Late, but...hmm."
ySy8mcceTno,"oh this is gonna be so bad, i cant wait"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man tormented me during my childhood I couldn’t go to sleep for so many nights
ySy8mcceTno,Here we go again with another stupid video game movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, I think the idea for a Slenderman movie is quite good. I mean not everyone known him and the background could be very interesting to build a good horror movie... however, the trailer was horrible...it failed to capture the Slenderman nature, he supposed to be methodical, creepy, mysterious....here it looks like your average horror monster...so yeah, pretty bad."
ySy8mcceTno,*insert comment about Logan Paul*
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman and the 8 pages is still a playable game and Slender: the Arrival is like the number 2 in my opinion
ySy8mcceTno,yyyyessss
ySy8mcceTno,Not sure if I wanna give up my 20 dollars for this...
ySy8mcceTno,Straight crap... there I called it
ySy8mcceTno,This is not okay. A little girl got stabbed because of two crazy girls who believed this thing was real. Absolutely no one should go see this. Despicable.
ySy8mcceTno,"....really took you 5 years to do this,"
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't know we were back in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yea I can't wait 👌👍🔥❤️
ySy8mcceTno,"I find the constant switching to black screen to be quite annoying. Like are u trying to scare me with ""Peekaboo""???"
ySy8mcceTno,You’re late.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like another ring movie. Replaceing the little girl with a tall skinny man wearing a suit was a wise choice ill admit.
ySy8mcceTno,Your only what like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Aburrido.
ySy8mcceTno,smh
ySy8mcceTno,GAYYYYYYYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,I will probably watch half this get pissed leave and watch Marble Hornets again.
ySy8mcceTno,When will film makers learn that when you make a movie based on a game it NEVER works out this movie is gonna be horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Caaaaancer
ySy8mcceTno,"FINALLY! 
The bad part is I have to ask my mom to let me watch this flim
I bet the answer is no...
But I love slendy 
And also shame on the two girls who almost killed thier friend because of him. 2014 is a f upped year..."
ySy8mcceTno,"He wasn't white and in a suit 
There wasn't any paper 
No flashlight 
No crunching of feet"
ySy8mcceTno,This could've been so great. I don't even see a plot in this trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,If Jeff the killer makes a cameo appearance I swear to fucking god
ySy8mcceTno,MY 12 YEAR OLD CREEPY PASTA DREAMS ARE TRUE
ySy8mcceTno,"The only way this movie will actually work is if they don’t add any back story to slendy, never show his actual body/face until near the end of the movie or not at all, make his method of killing phycological instead of physical, no drama, no good ending, no main character that survives the entire movie, and add a whole lot of messing with the watcher’s/character’s minds."
ySy8mcceTno,YESSS
ySy8mcceTno,"Breaking news, kids believe that slender man is real again and decide to stab there friend 35 times. They believed they would be accepted for killing someone.





This is seriously a terrible idea."
ySy8mcceTno,Minecraft movie when?
ySy8mcceTno,To a photoshop competition and then to a creepy pasta then to a horror game then to a meme and then into a movie? Wth lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, I have one thing to say:
It is Sony Pictures Entertainment."
ySy8mcceTno,Whoever started slender man is probably sitting here watching this and is like wow my creation from that photoshop contest it has come this far *claps*
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que no sea otra mierda como Death note de netflix :v
ySy8mcceTno,8 years late for this dead creepypasta 😕
ySy8mcceTno,no aparecion jeff the killer dislaik
ySy8mcceTno,;ooooo
ySy8mcceTno,The guy who created slender man must be making bank
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,This looks just awful but that ain't gonna stop me from watching it.
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be comedy gold. Another hit for Sony Pictures.
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for that fnaf movie to drop in 3 years😂
ySy8mcceTno,Amuma
ySy8mcceTno,"1. You’re five and a half years late. 

2. You couldn’t even get the actual fucking story right. 

3. The Slender sickness doesn’t make people kill themself. In the lore it makes people drawn to the Slender Man. 

4. This happened, and we let it happen."
ySy8mcceTno,De hace mucho que lo estaba esperando
ySy8mcceTno,1:45 this is not slender hes not dressed as nice as him
ySy8mcceTno,How could you make a video after a girl almost died from being stabbed by two deranged girls who believed Slender Man was real?!?!!?!
ySy8mcceTno,"I just clicked to thumbs down this movie, children have commited suicide. This is pretty tacky!"
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like such a low budget film smhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, hol up! They didn't even add that classic sound you hear when you see slender. Ya know... the one that sounds like a static TV, instead it sounded like electricity going off the fritz....If you're going to do something 6 years late atleast do it right"
ySy8mcceTno,If this movie is actually really good and original...I'll have a heart attack and die...
ySy8mcceTno,"Que asco, nisiquiera se ve el puto Slenderman, de por si  no hay mucho que sacarle, a nadie le importa, y nisiquiera se verá el puto Slenderman, que asco"
ySy8mcceTno,"So... What is coming next?
Dear David trailer in 2019?"
ySy8mcceTno,Holy moly
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for Roblox the movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Walking dead? 2:10
ySy8mcceTno,Que decepción.
ySy8mcceTno,When she was yelling no I was yelling yes
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!! I was waiting for this since a long time ago!!
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,"Have to be honest not bad, pretty excited"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m feeling Nostalgic!
ySy8mcceTno,"and to think this creature started as a drawing by one guy. then it was popularized by marble hornets (who probably made a better overall story than this). then everyone found out about him when it was made into a game, and then finally a movie by sony pictures"
ySy8mcceTno,Brazil?????
ySy8mcceTno,Why this have so many dislikes ?
ySy8mcceTno,I should’ve known they were gonna come out with a movie for this crap
ySy8mcceTno,They’re a couple years too late on this
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a pretty good sequel to the first Emoji movie! Very topical and culturally relevant. Will definitely buy tickets yesterday!
ySy8mcceTno,Sonunda çıkıyor amk filmi ne oynardık oyununu 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"DUCK YEAH BOI IT'S TRUE!!! THEY REALLY *ARE* MAKING A SLENDER MAN MOVIE!!!
Sony I love you guys truly I do"
ySy8mcceTno,"Marble Hornets, TribeTwelve, Everymanhybrid, and others still did it better..."
ySy8mcceTno,What scares me most is that I write like that girl smh
ySy8mcceTno,This bout whack af
ySy8mcceTno,Fap worthy
ySy8mcceTno,Evil sticc boi
ySy8mcceTno,Bye Bye Man 2 came quick
ySy8mcceTno,A psychological horror movie about the Slenderman stabbings would've been much better
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to begrudgingly see this movie and die from the disappointment
ySy8mcceTno,I am Sargent Teletubbie. I shall start the rain of war teletubbies here. If you would like to join please reply to this comment.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks alright...
ySy8mcceTno,When I looked at this trailer I thought it sucked and I’m scared to see the movie because I’m afraid it’s not gonna be as good as the game
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if the person who made Marble Hornets also helped to make this movie...
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,So is this direct to home video or...?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman, I want a jeff the killer one and then I want a SCP one"
ySy8mcceTno,wow I just watched the whole movie
ySy8mcceTno,0:02 WILL?
ySy8mcceTno,"Just saying, it’s best to judge a movie when it’s actually out, this is just basically a teaser and I’m sure there’s gonna me more trailers out"
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the meme movie
ySy8mcceTno,Looks lame
ySy8mcceTno,es el peor trailer hecho en la  historia
ySy8mcceTno,Who else got that slenderman survivor video for up next?
ySy8mcceTno,aka Revenge of the FatMan
ySy8mcceTno,You came late bruh
ySy8mcceTno,"It's a simple fucking concept. How do you mess up Slenderman, it's literally scripted out for you!"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the IT movie everyone is talking about thats coming out?
ySy8mcceTno,Slendymon ~ markiplier.
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't like the trailer but I love Slender Man so what the hell, I'ma go see it."
ySy8mcceTno,Ay thats pretty good ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
ySy8mcceTno,Is This real?
ySy8mcceTno,I might look at it on some website
ySy8mcceTno,Ay
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this said ""spiderman"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony Pictures never fails to make mediocre, post-trend movies"
ySy8mcceTno,Waoo yo iré a verla
ySy8mcceTno,Scary movies aren't even scary no more....Maybe cause I got older I don't find em scary
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf??? 😕 😑😑😑😑
ySy8mcceTno,What a trashy looking rip off
ySy8mcceTno,I'll be genuinely shocked if this doesn't bomb.
ySy8mcceTno,You are a bit too late
ySy8mcceTno,By the same people who created the emoji movie ladies and gentlemen.
ySy8mcceTno,They finally made a movie about this
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon: Five Nights at Freddy’s
ySy8mcceTno,no
ySy8mcceTno,I've never pressed the pause button in fear faster
ySy8mcceTno,Is that a distorted Loud Nigra at 1:55 I hear?
ySy8mcceTno,From the creators of the emoji movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Ho my gooooooooood
ySy8mcceTno,Finally there is a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t look good. It’ll Probably be a flop like that friend request or whatever that crappy movie was called.
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer kind of sucks, I can't tell if the movie will be any good."
ySy8mcceTno,This...... Has potential
ySy8mcceTno,I drew a picture of slenderman January 3 what a coincidence
ySy8mcceTno,Another video game movie nobody asked for!
ySy8mcceTno,"Fine, I can dig it."
ySy8mcceTno,Once the movie drops videos like 3 am challenges and other things like exploring places at night or making a fort are gonna drop
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon: a bunch of other creepypasta movies for cash-grabs.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m hella excited for this movie because I’ve been a big fan of slender man. But the only worry I have is that with horror movies it’s either a really good film or a cheesy bad film. So I’m praying that in this hit or miss situation it’ll be a hit because I’ve been waiting for this film for a very long time.
ySy8mcceTno,omg
ySy8mcceTno,Even know i thought slender man was stupid this movie is cool looking and i am going to move away from the hospital my school and the forest now i mean dang this looks brutal.
ySy8mcceTno,Rating?
ySy8mcceTno,1:42-1:43 Slender man just teleported next to her in no time flat
ySy8mcceTno,"yo when u releasin rebecca black's ""friday"" im looking forward for *DAT* movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna go dab at the premier.
ySy8mcceTno,I did not like that eye part at all
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting for that five nights at Freddie's movie to drop
ySy8mcceTno,It’s probably gonna be bad I prefer you watch the venom movie instead
ySy8mcceTno,"I was HOPING to see a faceless man in a suit, honing to the original game. I have a feeling that Slender Man will look different. I don't like that. But it look s like a fantastic movie that can keep you on edge with great effects."
ySy8mcceTno,THIS STARTED OFF AS A PHOTOSHOP CONTEST AND NOW A MOVIE WHAT THE? IM MAKING A VIDEO ABOUT THIS
ySy8mcceTno,You’re 6 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,next : scp foundation movies
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years late, with a movie that's nothing but gimmicks it looks like. A for effort."
ySy8mcceTno,I guess I can call this “The Return of the Creepypasta King”
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things vibes
ySy8mcceTno,"NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE. SCREW SLINDERMAN, SCREW THE GIRL IM BURNIG THAT FOREST TO THE GROUND AND KILLING MYSELF AFTERWARDS!"
ySy8mcceTno,sexual offenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Out of all the scarier things their making a movie of this
ySy8mcceTno,What do u say when u sound out SONY spelled backwards?
ySy8mcceTno,Sony......Just why....
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve fea
ySy8mcceTno,coming soon... Jeff The Killer.... Coming soon... Slenderman vs Jeff The Killer!!!!! 😱👻🔪
ySy8mcceTno,if he isn't in a tuxedo sony is going to get hacked again
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony just keeps running out of ideas, don't they?"
ySy8mcceTno,At last
ySy8mcceTno,"As much as I want to, I’m not sure if I feel comfortable watching this with that incident and the fading popularity of said subject matter"
ySy8mcceTno,Why did they feel the need to make this?
ySy8mcceTno,"Well...I mean-...dude, just go watch the Mable Hornets channel. They did a way better job with the Slenderman creepy pasta story."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie shoulda came out in 2012 or something
ySy8mcceTno,Dear god
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for the little kids?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,It's about FUCKING TIME
ySy8mcceTno,Plz be rated R
ySy8mcceTno,HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS AWESOME
ySy8mcceTno,"Nothing personal, kid."
ySy8mcceTno,trash acting
ySy8mcceTno,Stefan Struve
ySy8mcceTno,Make a Lavender Town movie next
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna watch this for the memes
ySy8mcceTno,Nice....
ySy8mcceTno,*cough* Dont waste yo 💰
ySy8mcceTno,Lol why does this remind me of stranger things shadow monster😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,And to say that this started in an internet forum ... the owner must be getting wet with money :v
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie will either be hilariously bad or good, like no in between basically"
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets anyone?😂
ySy8mcceTno,No wonder this movie is made by Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Nice job Sony 👍🏻😁😃
ySy8mcceTno,1:56 RAAUUUUUUUUULLL
ySy8mcceTno,This is the sloppiest trailer I've ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,"Meh, not really that impressed..."
ySy8mcceTno,Idk why but I feel like I've seen this already
ySy8mcceTno,Dear David el comienzo :v
ySy8mcceTno,Took us long enough to get this 🙂
ySy8mcceTno,Tb to 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone saying this 6 years late. Maybe it was for the better to make it better. Perfection takes time
ySy8mcceTno,I hope its not going to be like the story about those 2 girls who killed that other girl. That's going to be boring.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!!!!!! UGH BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks stupid. That's all,I got."
ySy8mcceTno,#SlenderMan
ySy8mcceTno,We are *NOT* doing this again!
ySy8mcceTno,Hola
ySy8mcceTno,"We're gonna get a Five Nights at Freddy's movie in like, 20 years lol XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Any other creepypasta fans excited?
ySy8mcceTno,Perfect timing another forest video
ySy8mcceTno,7 putos años esperando esta mamada >:'v pero estan jodidamente hermoso ue :''3  woa llorar de la emocion prro :'3
ySy8mcceTno,You’re kinda late....
ySy8mcceTno,"Daily Reminder: This is made by Sony Pictures, the guys attempting to cash in on literally everything that kids will remember. From Angry Birds, to Emojis, to this."
ySy8mcceTno,This is pretty relevant all the kids like slender man these days. From the fresh hot new game
ySy8mcceTno,Ye boi :) slenda man !
ySy8mcceTno,Uneeded film
ySy8mcceTno,Has Hollywood sunk to an all time low?  Can you get any possible lower?  For God's Sake!
ySy8mcceTno,Did they even read the creepypasta? Like what are you doing sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't say you're referencing  the two girls that tried to kill there friend for slenderman...thats poor writing.
ySy8mcceTno,"You're 6 years too late Sony,it's no longer 2012...I'm sure we've all been waiting for this since 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,The 2011 is coming again xd
ySy8mcceTno,One movie made for piewdiepie
ySy8mcceTno,This is a bad idea. Just another flop.
ySy8mcceTno,Que mierda en serio 😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,So this is it huh? I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Yall who/know what the boogey man is?
ySy8mcceTno,Could this possibly be... the Slenderman movie we deserve? Cause while Always Watching was... kinda okay to me at least... It wasn't a Slenderman movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Puros pinches comentarios en inglés! Nms! ,pero los que hablamos español somos chingones!"
ySy8mcceTno,WHAT.....
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho?
ySy8mcceTno,"After 5 years, finally we have this."
ySy8mcceTno,I never knew people still talked about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,excuse me but y’all just brought back a part of my child hood that didn’t need to be remembered lmao
ySy8mcceTno,they should add slendermans proxies to this too
ySy8mcceTno,People gonna pay money to see a shadowy figure for five mins in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,#trash
ySy8mcceTno,This will be better than insidious who agree?
ySy8mcceTno,Yes! Finally!
ySy8mcceTno,"At least it's not a found footage movie but I am still pissed off they cancelled Entity (The 2013 Slender Man movie) for this because while I am still excited this is happening, I am not as hooked as I was when I saw the Entity trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,IM SO EXITED!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"it doesnt feels like the ""slender man"" like i remember him on the game, and are we getting a 'collecting page' mechanic in this movie? :v"
ySy8mcceTno,Little late but im hype af
ySy8mcceTno,Why even make this when EverymanHybrid exists
ySy8mcceTno,This is actually pretty cool hopefully the movie can be good
ySy8mcceTno,THE DEMORGON
ySy8mcceTno,itd be great if everyone could stop saying this is late and just watch or not watch the movie -_-
ySy8mcceTno,I think it’s safe for all off us to say that this movie finna be some Garbo
ySy8mcceTno,Just a bit late huh?
ySy8mcceTno,Pasaron 84 años desde q sacaron el juego
ySy8mcceTno,You're about 5-6 years late smh
ySy8mcceTno,"This was just disturbing, not scary. Plus , it’s 6 years late.
👏 👏 nice job"
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks kinda shitty, doesn't live up to the fear the videogames created."
ySy8mcceTno,"This could have benefited from being a B movie. Small crew, small budget, film it in the found footage style, have the focus be the main character finding the 8 pages, keep creepy imagery and the feeling of being followed that the first game provided. Drop the jumpscares. Not too much story. Just scares. Instead y'all gotta be 6 years late and have it be regular hollywood horror movie trash. This looks like every other horror movie that comes out these days."
ySy8mcceTno,boy only see the hand that's wasn't even scary
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is pretty late to the trend... but it still looks like it’ll be alright. Let’s see where this goes, old ideas can be pretty well executed most of the time."
ySy8mcceTno,"Marble Hornets did it better fyi, also looks like you wont see much of him in this, just ""he is in your head"" give me a break lol"
ySy8mcceTno,What did Logan Paul do ?
ySy8mcceTno,OMG JOEY KING!! (Joey played Claire in Wish Upon) I can't wait for more trailers omg omg omg I NEED MORE TRAILERS I DO NOT CARE if people say this is lame or that Sony is trying to make more money off of an outdated urban legend I want to see a legit fear factor movie.
ySy8mcceTno,oн god ғυcĸ yoυ ѕlender мan
ySy8mcceTno,Por fin
ySy8mcceTno,The Slenderman isn't supposed to make sounds though.
ySy8mcceTno,Praise god
ySy8mcceTno,Filmed by Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,"Not true to the legend its gonna be bad, slenderman isnt a shadow its a figure and the kids dont kill themselves they get scared and think diffeently at least use some of the stories out there"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this oficial?
ySy8mcceTno,I actually want to see this.
ySy8mcceTno,"another poor Hollywood shitty movie, nothing will top off the 70s horrors"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man = Skinny Boy
ySy8mcceTno,God Has abandoned us
ySy8mcceTno,"1. Why now?!
2. How does this trailer have ANYTHING to do with Slenderman?!
3. What's with all the stabbing?!"
ySy8mcceTno,Worse trailer of all time. Is this a class project or sum thing
ySy8mcceTno,Have been 84 years...
ySy8mcceTno,"Ain’t Goan lie, I’d go watch."
ySy8mcceTno,did i just traveled back in time?
ySy8mcceTno,"This isn't a joke,  right?"
ySy8mcceTno,"So, when Slender Man is the least relevant you make a movie."
ySy8mcceTno,So 2012 has passed we know this right
ySy8mcceTno,This tells no story
ySy8mcceTno,They should of been done a slender man movie. Acutally they should of worked on it when it was first out.
ySy8mcceTno,"This honestly looks pretty good. 

Don’t mind the “too cool for school” kids in this comments section. Who cares if it’s years after the slender man hype. Maybe that’s the point."
ySy8mcceTno,This was years ago why now????
ySy8mcceTno,They should get those two little girls that stabbed that other girl for Slender Man to do a cameo!
ySy8mcceTno,"A little late.... just a little bit. Just by idk

6 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Are they making my 8 year old fear in a movie
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this year the horror movies won't be dry.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,I thought slender man was about a tall guy who killed 12 year olds that wondered off into the woods
ySy8mcceTno,"NO NO STOP IT, STOP IT !!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,I agree with you where is Jeff because if Jeff was fighting slender man in this movie I've am going to love it
ySy8mcceTno,This better be fucking good
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a lot of wanting to see him and how cool and scary he could be the whole movie and just getting kinda bored of and scared girl. Still prob going to see it when I can rent
ySy8mcceTno,"Isn't it ""slender""? and not ""slender man""?"
ySy8mcceTno,"IDK though, video game movies are almost never good...good luck to this one, I guess!"
ySy8mcceTno,OH HELL NO TO NO NO NOOO
ySy8mcceTno,THANKS!!  I HATE IT ALREADY
ySy8mcceTno,Finally... it looks pretty good.
ySy8mcceTno,wow the movie no one asked for
ySy8mcceTno,Sony doesn't even make a movie about his origin Sony sucks
ySy8mcceTno,Inb4 Creepy Pasta Cinematic Universe
ySy8mcceTno,Yup now there’s gonna be more people believing in slenderman and start stabbing ppl 20 times 😒
ySy8mcceTno,Either this is a crap movie or crap cut for a preview
ySy8mcceTno,"😮 😲 😱 🤫
👖 👖 👖 👖"
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell is this 😶
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man story made famous by youtube... however, This is not gonna be good. Already disappointed from the trailers. Listen to some slender man tales on youtube, its worth more than $21 that you would pay to see this crap."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie seems like to be a confusing twisty type of movie
ySy8mcceTno,To be honest you’re REALLY late for this. The slender man trend has left but honestly it got back with the trend of slender the arrival and getting better with the following DLCs and supposed follow up of slender the arrival but honestly it’ll be great.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol wut.
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks ridiculous.
ySy8mcceTno,Does this movie have anything to do with the actual slender man lore?
ySy8mcceTno,Nigga your like 7 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Después de este video tendré que ver el del pájaro loco
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if the guy who drew Slenderman ever thought he would get this big
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all really ran out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,Knew this was gonna happen
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,umm... No please.
ySy8mcceTno,I would have preferred the 8 pages story.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks the same as every other horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,Hellllll nahhhhhhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey I remember slenderman






*remember*"
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon:Slendrina
ySy8mcceTno,Wait... I saw this when it was called Marble Hornets. And when it was a series and not a movie. Sure the stories aren’t really the same here but... I’m nearly certain that this movie won’t do as critically well as many think it will.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony stop green lighting dumb movies
ySy8mcceTno,I don't get it 😕
ySy8mcceTno,Como se sentirá ahora el Weey que creo a Slenderman en Internet al saber que explorarán su personaje sin darle un solo peso o reconocimiento JAJAJAJA
ySy8mcceTno,Man a bit to fuckin late why would you make this into a movie I think it should still be noticed as a video game
ySy8mcceTno,Are they tryna make fun of that little girl who almost died or are they really just this late to the game here?...
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things 3 looks great!
ySy8mcceTno,It’s been 6 years
ySy8mcceTno,I love the disturbing images like the maggots and the needles. Slender man is supposed to get inside your head and drive you crazy enough to hurt yourself. Also I hope they barely show him. He always needs to be super far away or out of focus. What makes him so scary is humanoid unknown figure.
ySy8mcceTno,QUICK FIND THE PAGES FOR IT WILL BE OVER !!
ySy8mcceTno,Imma see this movie... but wasn't this supposed to happen like 5-6 years ago??
ySy8mcceTno,trailer.exe has stopped responding
ySy8mcceTno,How bout no?
ySy8mcceTno,"Nothing is remotely, legitimately scary anymore."
ySy8mcceTno,Uh yeah 911?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought I saw slender before but it might have been my imagination
ySy8mcceTno,Algun latino?
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf!
ySy8mcceTno,"🤦‍♂️ “Slender Man”, guess the other people are right,”. Sony don’t have other ideas of making a good movie..."
ySy8mcceTno,Que chinge asu madre el América :v
ySy8mcceTno,Only like a decade late
ySy8mcceTno,This look so dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Would anyone would watch an SCP movie
ySy8mcceTno,"For all you YouTube people saying that this is “a little late”, yeah it kinda is, but it still looks pretty good, even if it’s kinda cliché."
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,I bet that the movie is going to turn        slender man a mysterious force to be reckoned with into a generic horror movie monster.
ySy8mcceTno,They have ran out of ideas at this point
ySy8mcceTno,"Give me reasons why this movie is gonna be bad. Its 2018 and you all criticize movies the same way. ""Creators from Emoji Movie"" ""Lmao"" ""Fan trailer?"" Give the movie a chance and you won't like it, do everyone else a favor, and get lost. If you're a troll, you have my permission to burn in hell. If you want a better Slenderman movie, make your own. ""Sorry 6 years late"""
ySy8mcceTno,"We've all waited for this, now it's here. Hope it's going to be based on the psychological  aspect of the creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Seems dumb
ySy8mcceTno,"No matter what a Hollywood production based on slender will never compare to marble hornets, everymanhybrid and tribe twelve."
ySy8mcceTno,Some girls murdered there friend over this thing. Don’t glorify it anymore than it already has been
ySy8mcceTno,I have the deleted vlog from Logan on my channel
ySy8mcceTno,Have a bad vibe on this production of Slenderman. It would be better for Channel Zero to produce; cause this story was inspired by those 2 girls and the 19 year old murder 2 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t this STOP being relevant by 2013?

ySy8mcceTno,Markiplier is going to flip out when he sees this
ySy8mcceTno,the most anticipated film of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,"Did anyone click on the thumbnail thinking it was ""Spider-Man"" lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Ive waited for this for too long
ySy8mcceTno,Nada que ver con Slenderman la película
ySy8mcceTno,THE EMOJI MOVIE NOW THIS WTF SONY!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"_Here's to hoping they're will be a Marble Hornet's Reference... I mean, seems like an interesting movie either way but... There is so many things you could do with this movie knowing the lore of the character..._"
ySy8mcceTno,"would be cool if they made the camera glitch a little every time he was on screen, would do good homage to some of the lore IMO."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Reminds of the days of 6th grade, when this was all kids talked about"
ySy8mcceTno,"I am so upset that I gave Sony Pictures my watch-time and helped this stay trending. Going to go watch Concrete Giraffes now. It probably has better writing and, from what I could see, better acting."
ySy8mcceTno,How about no
ySy8mcceTno,Mmm next time eyeless jack
ySy8mcceTno,5 years later
ySy8mcceTno,*is Logan paul gonna vlog it?*
ySy8mcceTno,You just had talked to far....
ySy8mcceTno,I love it when they add the games music the film version like at the end they had the slender man bell noise.
ySy8mcceTno,Well uh this looks interesting. I mean it’s a creepypasta that was actually popular years ago made into a movie but I’m not just gonna say ERGH ITS GARBADGE AAAAA
ySy8mcceTno,"honestly I'm pretty excited for this. Slender man has always been really cool to me. It's a monster created and popularized entirely by the people of the internet. Slender is a fresh modern-day monster. The monster design is excellent, simple and easily recognizable. That said, the actual trailer could be better. Hope this movie is good."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks terrible lol
ySy8mcceTno,Y DID I CLICK ON DIS TRAILER WHEN I KNOW IM GONNA REGET IT
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul eat a bag of Dicks!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I got a bad feeling about this. Like 'Dragon Ball Evolution' bad feels.
ySy8mcceTno,Ooooooohhhh B O I
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman is soo 2010, keep up with the creepy pasta trends man"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there's an episode where Slender man goes on a murderous rampage in textopolis.
ySy8mcceTno,Best comedy 2018.
ySy8mcceTno,"Nah, 4/10 have no chance of being a good movie, srry have low hopes."
ySy8mcceTno,wack
ySy8mcceTno,I like when the killer is like a foot away and then the screen goes black... Its like what happened? How did he kill her rip her head off? Eat her whole body one bite idk
ySy8mcceTno,"You're only... * googles it * five years, six months, and nine days late."
ySy8mcceTno,Yo flipo  :v
ySy8mcceTno,"When superhero movies get old and good original movies break the bank, hollywood will turn to memes."
ySy8mcceTno,Vkook is real.
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul is pretending to be slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Só isso? Fraco demais.
ySy8mcceTno,Try-hard movie. Looks stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,She needs Jesus
ySy8mcceTno,The next creepy pasta movie should be _________
ySy8mcceTno,This needed to come out like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"This is all wrong. Slenderman needs to be slow and methodical. A la ""it follows"". I mean, this movie should write itself. Father and daughter move into new small town. They go out and explore the town because the daughter is bummed out about the move. They meet a strange old man outside the general store that is staring down the daughter in a creepy way. He then gives the daughter some kind of bizzare sounding warning about the Slenderman but it scares the daughter and the father comes out and tells the man off
Next scene is at night at dinner. The Mom is dead from a car accident. The daughter is sad and she says something that initiated a fight between her and her dad. She goes to her room. She's crying looks at the picture of Mom on the windowsill and feels a bit better, but from the corner of her eye she spots a strange tall figure standing outside in the distance by the treeline outside the house. It shifts behind a tree and she runs downstairs to her dad and they go out to look for the man and find nothing. Next scene is the daughter at lunch school eating alone. She overhears some boys next to her talking about the  Slenderman and the missing children. This giving the audience some general backstory to the Slenderman. Next scene is night again. Dad is asleep and sees the slendyboi outside his window. Dad freaks out grabs baseball bat and tells daughter to get up and get close to him while he looks around the house and find nothing. Next scene is daughter at school. Some boys come up to her to eat with her at lunch. Talk about how she's the new girl and then to conversations moves to the Slenderman. The boys wanna go into the woods and look for him tonight. The daughter is terrified but wants to make new friends so she goes. Next scene is the children at night in woods. Slenderman finds them takes daughter. The boys go to the police and the police go to the father who goes into the woods to look for the daughter. As he walks along the trail he finds a camcorder underneath a tree and a note stapled to the tree explaining the rules of the game. Add some cinematic slendyboi spooks and BOOM it's a movie. Don't add all this weird unnecessary garbage."
ySy8mcceTno,Many Spook
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim?
ySy8mcceTno,"Everyone is complaining about it being too late, but everyone is happy because of the incredibles 2 like."
ySy8mcceTno,"se eu esperava mais?
kkkkkkkkkkktalvez"
ySy8mcceTno,"at least the slenderman didn""t film a dead person and put it on the internet"
ySy8mcceTno,"Took you long enough.






Actually, too long."
ySy8mcceTno,"Coming soon....

Sid The E D G Y Kid"
ySy8mcceTno,This is already the best year of my life
ySy8mcceTno,Lol what really?
ySy8mcceTno,This is disturbing. And Sony should be ashamed. This Slenderman stuff has been a factor in children hurting children and is likely to continue to. Its very negative.
ySy8mcceTno,First it was the emoji movie and now this. I’m not sure if I really care but it’s funny how Sony tries to be mainstream
ySy8mcceTno,javier botet is slender man huh....... I have to watch this movie
ySy8mcceTno,I need a Creepy Pasta movie now.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so sad
ySy8mcceTno,hi bich
ySy8mcceTno,looks hella cheesy...had the potential to be really good too :/
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see that
ySy8mcceTno,"Just saying is this even based off the source material, legit looks like whoever wrote this sat down played the games than some knock-off ones or whatever and wrote a script with some fillers. Slender Man better have more screen time than than the girl did in the ring ffs."
ySy8mcceTno,Yes my Favorite Internet Monster getting A Movie😎🔥💯
ySy8mcceTno,Nope
ySy8mcceTno,I don't care what anyone says. I think this is gonna be a good movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Striking when the iron’s hot I see
ySy8mcceTno,I saw an ad for this and thought it was a fan film
ySy8mcceTno,Not scary
ySy8mcceTno,Bout 7 years to late lol
ySy8mcceTno,where's Logan Paul?
ySy8mcceTno,"Coming soon hopefully not a bad video game movie 




Again"
ySy8mcceTno,And why did two murderous 12 year old girls wanna go live with this guy?
ySy8mcceTno,I hope slender man is as good as I hope: the psychological horror monster we all love
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus christ it baffles me how you guys post this and think its good Dx it was a game / online story stop trying to bring it back
ySy8mcceTno,They shouldn't be making a movie about this. It caused a little girl to almost be murdered by her friends this in NOT COOL. !!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,So is Logan Paul gonna vlog that girl that dies in the woods?
ySy8mcceTno,Wait what is this really happening???!!
ySy8mcceTno,i don't think sony fully understands Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,What did that girl in the end have in her hands!? (Flips table)
ySy8mcceTno,Please dont suck please dont suck please dont suck
ySy8mcceTno,"Like, si no entendiste una mierda"
ySy8mcceTno,It's making me uncomfortable how she's using the expo marker
ySy8mcceTno,you’re about 4 years late not gonna lie
ySy8mcceTno,Is the whole movie gonna have no talking lol
ySy8mcceTno,Tooooooooooooooooo late
ySy8mcceTno,I just want to see slender more
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for this movie to come out!
ySy8mcceTno,"Way to strike while the iron is hot, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,7 years late I think
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman wants to bring the emojis into the real world, they're the real monsters here"
ySy8mcceTno,Los niños ratas se van a poner muy contentos.
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG SLENDERMAN IS SO SCARY

*internet explorer*"
ySy8mcceTno,"If you guys are a fan of this type of thing, there's a really creepy youtube channel called ""Setting Things Down"".  On surface level it seems normal, but the more you watch the more you notice.  Check it out!  The community over there is great too!"
ySy8mcceTno,Their late for this. They should make an Scp 096 one instead.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony pictures has the best movies
ySy8mcceTno,Tb to when I used to read creepypastas a lot... Y'all are late lmaoao
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait 😍
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda looks shity the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, I'd watched it. It doesn't look that bad tbh, it looks similar to the movie ""the ring"" and has that eerie vibe and I like that"
ySy8mcceTno,"TELL ME , 
THIS IS A GRET MOVIE ??"
ySy8mcceTno,Is there an actual storyline orrr?? Bc that was random as frick
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman looks okay and all but Was He Slow?
ySy8mcceTno,Where's my Sonic.exe movie Sony!? 😤
ySy8mcceTno,8 years late
ySy8mcceTno,3 years later buddy
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone think Blumhouse Productions would do better?
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets better be involved in this
ySy8mcceTno,Where the hell is the FNAF movie?
ySy8mcceTno,0:20 Jigsaw?
ySy8mcceTno,HELLA SHOOK
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who thinks the trailer makes it look like if the ring and the Blair witch project had a baby and this is the result????
ySy8mcceTno,Too little too late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Took them almost 5 years to make something that doesn't look worth it.
ySy8mcceTno,is this a real movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"It seems like they had no idea what made slender man scary in the first place, don’t get me wrong, it looks unsettling but I want a Slender man movie not ANOTHER movie about possession"
ySy8mcceTno,Who's gonna watch this?
ySy8mcceTno,Is it 2011
ySy8mcceTno,ok its was so famous thare ganna make a movie thats nice?
ySy8mcceTno,All creepypasta fangirls going crazy. xd
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man Slender Man all the children try to run because your 
Trailer is so dumb"
ySy8mcceTno,MAKE A CREEPYPASTA MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,This is a bad trailer.  This does not make me want to watch this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,1:56 keemstar scream
ySy8mcceTno,Probably (and definitely) not as good as Marble Hornets but if it comes out in my country I'll go see it. 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,"I would've been excited if this was released when I was in middle school, not college."

ySy8mcceTno,"you're about, like, idk, 5 years late"
ySy8mcceTno,"stop it, get some help"
ySy8mcceTno,Crewpypasta cinematic universe?
ySy8mcceTno,"More people might be interested in watching this movie if you build a time machine, go back to 2012 then release the trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,wonder if those two girls who stabbed there friend will be watching this
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is not going to do well. Even if it's a good movie. The slender hype is very much dead.
ySy8mcceTno,10 years I’ve waited
ySy8mcceTno,SAVE YOUR MONEY
ySy8mcceTno,Knowing some people find this garbage entertaining is what is really scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Sp00k
ySy8mcceTno,"alantutorial is alive

ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things rip-off
ySy8mcceTno,Uhh... it's a little while till April fools
ySy8mcceTno,Gaaaaaaay.
ySy8mcceTno,"Speaking of Sony movies when are they going to release the trailer for the Venom movie? And also I'm hyped of this movie, I think it's going to be great."
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be bad.
ySy8mcceTno,This isn't 2014 anymore

ySy8mcceTno,Como esperaba esta maldita película
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell no I skipped the add for this so fast when I saw the name at the bottom I was terrified of him for like a year of my life

ySy8mcceTno,A movie about something scarier like the Scp foundation would’ve been nice but they went with the dead creepypasta of 2010
ySy8mcceTno,"Idk it just seems that they are getting the lore completely wrong, I’m not going to watch it because it’s just going to be jumpscares."
ySy8mcceTno,5-6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,#yesican
ySy8mcceTno,Avengers Infinity War trailer is still better
ySy8mcceTno,Too few slender for me
ySy8mcceTno,Boogeyman Rival...It's About time Slendy got the green light.
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope they're going with the original concept for Slenderman, before he was toned down; originally, he'd murder people, remove their internal organs to put them in plastic bags and stuff them back into the body cavity, and then he'd stab them through a tree branch and leave their corpse hanging.

Nowadays, he just makes people disappear, which is unsettling but nowhere near as horrifying."
ySy8mcceTno,OMG :0
ySy8mcceTno,"im hella disappointed, didnt even see one operator symbol"
ySy8mcceTno,Why did you have to show maggots?
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is classic glad its getting made into a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Ooooffffffff
ySy8mcceTno,This is 3 years late!!!
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of the early 2010's
ySy8mcceTno,Sony ruins everything people so don't expect much
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie about the nigga still its a little too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow.  A movie about scp would've been so much more interesting tbh, slender man should've died with his terrible games years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,I swear if they make a Creepy Pasta cinematic universe...
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder what they're going to do with Sally.
ySy8mcceTno,Did SYFY make this or is it fan made?
ySy8mcceTno,if this is slender man were in the f ing world is he
ySy8mcceTno,Don't please stop you don't have to do this
ySy8mcceTno,Finally he cams
ySy8mcceTno,Feels like a Bray wyatt promo
ySy8mcceTno,Wow a Girl slabs herself in the head .. and that's Trending??  Good job YouTube. So lets put this next to the DeadBody in the woods and the So Sorry Video. Get that Revenue! How about fixing things so we don;t keep losing Advertisers.
ySy8mcceTno,To bad it ain't 2012
ySy8mcceTno,You know with the girls sacrifice and murdering if a girl. You'd think you wouldn't start this
ySy8mcceTno,The Audience for this is all grown up and I'm sure has moved on from this Fad pretty sad if only they jumped on this sooner
ySy8mcceTno,Worst movie of 2018!
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait 
What"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't remember slender doing any of this
ySy8mcceTno,oof
ySy8mcceTno,"This should’ve been released years ago.

Glad they are releasing it tho and it would be great to see a sequel"
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't see anything Slender related in this
ySy8mcceTno,i wonder if they will have to find pages lol
ySy8mcceTno,this looks lit 💚👌
ySy8mcceTno,I too have seen the Ring and this movie seems to borrow alot from it.
ySy8mcceTno,Dude this should have came out 4 years ago when this was popular
ySy8mcceTno,Yes please thank you Sony
ySy8mcceTno,What about the 8 notes??
ySy8mcceTno,Yessssssss I've been waiting for this movie!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,0/10 black people in horror movies don't stab there eyes out
ySy8mcceTno,You couldn't give me $20 to see this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Most 12 year olds won’t know how much fun we had playing the game
ySy8mcceTno,This movie might be a dangerous idea...
ySy8mcceTno,I'M SO SCARE
ySy8mcceTno,Nut
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve bien solo no hagan lo que Netflix y la cagen

ySy8mcceTno,"Things missing:
A suit
The notes
The flashlight
Sense
Horror
Good ratings
My excitement"
ySy8mcceTno,And all of this came from a photoshopped photo. Wow!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender finally has a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look that scary and it barely showed slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this gonna be like Marble Hornets? Or Always Watching: A Marble Hornets story?
Because we don't need one of those again."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks really scary and good can’t wait for it to come out
ySy8mcceTno,i use to believe in slender man but hes fake
ySy8mcceTno,The ring 2.0
ySy8mcceTno,"watch them make a bloody Dead Bart movie next......or Roblox, that's what the kids love right ?! ............Smile Dog!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Im scared 😟
ySy8mcceTno,LOL WTF NIGGA

ySy8mcceTno,i see everything in this trailer that a stupid person in a regular movie would do. i cant wait to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Just the typical hollywood horror movie....
ySy8mcceTno,"Me watching the trailer: where is he? If your movie is about slender man show him! 

Me at 1:51: THAT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE HIM AND IT TOOK YOU 1 MINUTE AND 51 SECONDS TO SHOW HIM EVEN IN HALLOWEEN TRAILER MICHAEL MYERS APPEARED MORE THEN TWICE. 

me at the end of the trailer: meh I'll see it"
ySy8mcceTno,This just looks like any other horror movie and they just decided to slap Slender Man as the title
ySy8mcceTno,Lol ultimate bamboozle 2:39
ySy8mcceTno,"I want a *burrito*








Who else can relate"
ySy8mcceTno,Why did I think this movie was gonna be about the girl who got stabbed?
ySy8mcceTno,Who else was looking for Logan Paul.
ySy8mcceTno,No... Please don’t Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone notice The Ring type style to these images?
ySy8mcceTno,you're six years late
ySy8mcceTno,Is PewDiePie then main protagonist?
ySy8mcceTno,"Should a movie be made, that you can make a profit off of. about this character?. did they forget what those two girls did to their friend??."
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala y te mato sony!
ySy8mcceTno,"1,2 slendy's comin' for you... Amillion times yes!!!"

ySy8mcceTno,Esta madre es neta? :v
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG I never thought slenderman would get a film, I hope he wears a suit!"
ySy8mcceTno,I can see it now more edgey teenage girls stabbing because they think it’s real
ySy8mcceTno,*I DONT EVEN WANNA WAIT*
ySy8mcceTno,Combine drone footage with animation with one recorder note...tada a trailer! #amateur
ySy8mcceTno,uh-huh...
ySy8mcceTno,"I can tell that they aren't going for the ""8 pages"" route, which is disappointing, but it still looks fairly decent.

I hope they at least reference the pages."
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time
ySy8mcceTno,Pls don't fail.
ySy8mcceTno,Just find some random papers and this'll all be over
ySy8mcceTno,I have no idea what this is about
ySy8mcceTno,Nope...... nope....... NOPE!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Omfg yes
ySy8mcceTno,"Even though slenderman is'nt really a thing anymore, I'm still looking forward to this."
ySy8mcceTno,Its too late Sony too late....
ySy8mcceTno,Oh nice the Ring gets another sequel
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer literally told me nothing about the plot.
ySy8mcceTno,Someone's always watching me
ySy8mcceTno,This is definitly not for kids and yet i bet a 100 dollars 99 percent of everyone here is under 18
ySy8mcceTno,I just hope the proxy's are in this movie because if they are that would be fucking badass
ySy8mcceTno,"Here's a tip, Sony: just stick to making audio devices and video game consoles."
ySy8mcceTno,DOES THE MANS ACTUALLY HAVE A BLACK FACE (by the looks) WHAT ARE YOU DOING SONY
ySy8mcceTno,No...Just...No I'll stick to the game
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch MarbleHornets lol

ySy8mcceTno,They should’ve got the guys from marble hornets to help with this!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks....... not really promising:/
ySy8mcceTno,Looks interesting. I'll mostly go and see it in theaters
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Not good to make this movie a few years after 2 girls stabbed there friend to sacrifice her to Slenderman..... Yeah.... That's dark Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,when bae says eat the booty 2:14
ySy8mcceTno,BARRELS
ySy8mcceTno,when you get pickaxed to death in fortnite 1:34
ySy8mcceTno,"Just stop.... Please just stop, I bet 100% that this isn't going to be scary... It's going to turn out like the ""It"" remake"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm a sucker for horror movies. I'll just pretend it's not about slenderpenis
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this makes up for The Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is after the giant Slender Hype from 3 years ago so this probably isn’t just a Hollywood cash grab
ySy8mcceTno,Now we need Jeff the killer and eyeless jack
ySy8mcceTno,All I saw were a bunch of horror tropes that stopped being scary 20 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,2012 memories.
ySy8mcceTno,It reminds me of Rings
ySy8mcceTno,That’s tuff
ySy8mcceTno,#Icantseehimbecausehesfakeandalsohashtagsarefrickingstupidandtheyrecalledpoundsignshahagotchaidontlikeslendermanbecausehesdumbandthismovieisdumb
ySy8mcceTno,Are we back in 2012 again?
ySy8mcceTno,You're 7 years later
ySy8mcceTno,"""Hey! There's this horror game character called Slender Man! He's so *FAMOUS* and *NOT MILKED TOO MUCH* at all! Let's make a movie about him since he's a *VERY RECENT CONCEPT!*"
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly looks kinda stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not disagreeing that this trailer could've used some work, but I'd like to point out that people are complaining that there's no story shown in the trailer. And the number 1 complaint in most trailers is that they reveal the plot."
ySy8mcceTno,Is good coming jeff the killer plise
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman yes nexd
ySy8mcceTno,"0:43, is that fucking fan art on the bottom right?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman, In my house? It's more likely than you think."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,Faltó que pusieran en los créditos a los loquenderos >:v
ySy8mcceTno,is it 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,this doesn't look very good
ySy8mcceTno,"Well this is gonna ruin me🤣
But can't wait😬😊😐😮😰🤤"
ySy8mcceTno,I have no words for this upcoming movie..
ySy8mcceTno,"No thanks, ill stick with marble hornets"
ySy8mcceTno,before of 4 years later
ySy8mcceTno,Your 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I saw absolutely nothing in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,*Can you not?*
ySy8mcceTno,You can't see me? I guess Slender Man is really John Cena...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really stupid
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda wanna watch it
ySy8mcceTno,This comes right after the Logan Paul incident bruh
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like garbage
ySy8mcceTno,I swear large parts of this are just Slipknots 'The Devil In I' video
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man isn't even that popular No more and this movie looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,i need to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,N A N I
ySy8mcceTno,"This has been a long time coming. 
When I play the Slenderman games I get freaked out. 
I can’t wait to see this!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is gonna just be one of those weird movies. It's gonna have a bunch of nasty stuff, the entire movie is gonna have that grayish tint that gives it a weird feeling, then the movie is gonna have no actual point. It doesn't even look like it has a main character. I would love for there to be a good Slenderman movie, but this doesn't look like it's gonna be it."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the first slender man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon in 2021 Jeff the Killer.
ySy8mcceTno,I mean if there gonna do this at least make a thing for all the creepypastas. I honestly would rather see and SCP movie though because creepypasta is pretty dead.
ySy8mcceTno,#deadmeme
ySy8mcceTno,Haven't you ever stood next to a dead body before
ySy8mcceTno,fernanflooo
ySy8mcceTno,"seriously? why does movie studios do this crap with internet trends? they almost always fail (angry birds movie (it kind of failed), emoji movie) and now this."
ySy8mcceTno,i bet they showed the ending of the movie at 2:17
ySy8mcceTno,sigh i dont like this
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Here u are safe 🤗👋
ySy8mcceTno,WOOT WOOT
ySy8mcceTno,don is the man true
ySy8mcceTno,2009 llamó quieren devuelta sus crepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,Man stranger things 3 looks good af
ySy8mcceTno,Little late on this trend guys
ySy8mcceTno,"Are we doing this? Really- Oh, okay. Just get FBI SWAT in there and we'll take care of this fast."
ySy8mcceTno,It looks more disturbing then scary to me
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol, Slenderman is dead."
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it's Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,“Slender” I haven’t heard that name since Marble Hornets and EverymanHYBRID
ySy8mcceTno,People call me Slenderman and I get why
ySy8mcceTno,"This happened, and we all let it happen."
ySy8mcceTno,"A Reddit, Turned Meme, Turned Internet Game Franchise is now a movie... what next? 5NAF?"
ySy8mcceTno,This had to mean that Slender vs Jeff will be def happening
ySy8mcceTno,Too soon
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,this is a straight rip of the ring imagery
ySy8mcceTno,Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a real trailer or a bullshit trailer made by a fan
ySy8mcceTno,Can't say it looks good...
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood has run out of ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,It already looked like they butcherd it to be honest. But then again what else can you work with when you're making a movie about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,NO PLEASE DON'T FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T RELEASE THIS MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Description of movie trailer: 👌
ySy8mcceTno,why so many dislikes?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks genuinely terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man isn't scary it's an irrelevant internet meme that was popular 5 fuckin years ago, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,...Oooohhhh wooonndddeeerrffuuull
ySy8mcceTno,Chevere
ySy8mcceTno,can you dont
ySy8mcceTno,sony ruins anything it touches hotel 2 was bad but 1 was gud but 1 did not exist before but slender did so they will ruin that
ySy8mcceTno,lol
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie looks trash, I expected better ."
ySy8mcceTno,This actually doesn't look scary
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fake?
ySy8mcceTno,well this is intense
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Gay elephant noise at 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,"I really wanna see it but my parents wont let me
ETERNAL SADNESS"
ySy8mcceTno,They need to make a movie with slender man and all the other creepy pasta characters in it.
ySy8mcceTno,tbh it wasn't that scary really
ySy8mcceTno,I can tell 2018 gonna have a lot of good movies
ySy8mcceTno,Why is Logan Paul not in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Found slenderman in the suicide forest.
ySy8mcceTno,"This world is really something I tell you. Years ago someone wrote a story, time past and people loved it. Some draw fanart, other people talk about it search it and even narrated this story on youtube. Sometime later more people found out. They made songs for it, they made animations, even games for it, then two stupid b***h try to kill their friend and now we gonna have movie about this story.
I am telling you this world is really something. I wonder who will get paid for this only storyteller or with gamemaker?
BTW: I hope they wont fill this movie with bunch of sub-plot or bunch of none sense bs just to hit the 90 minute mark."
ySy8mcceTno,(งಠ_ಠ)ง　σ( •̀ ω •́ σ)
ySy8mcceTno,2013 was the ok time to make it but with time it might have been 2014 but maybe do to the attack it might have been cancelled?
ySy8mcceTno,https://chat.whatsapp.com/3kuZpB1j4U816g3VdJG7rT
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it's Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"It's gonna be one of two things: an extremely surprising decent movie that still rips off many better horror movies, or a really awful movie that rips off a nightmare on elm Street"
ySy8mcceTno,Que Bergah?! :v
ySy8mcceTno,wowowowowowowowowowow
ySy8mcceTno,Le trash
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh as somebody who loved marble hornets and watch both the original slender man movies I can tell you right now this is about to be a terrible representation of slenderman and at best will turn out as an ok movie unless the trailer is misleading
ySy8mcceTno,"(fangirleo :v) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!! por favor que no sea mierda cliche, por favor!"
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late but looks sorta badass
ySy8mcceTno,So the rumors came true...
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s 2018, and the company that brought us the cinematic masterpiece known to us lowly humans as “The Emoji Movie”, is now bringing us the likes of dead, mainstream characters back to life. All I can see from this is a flood of Logan Paul jokes, and a shitfest due to the forced nature of bringing back a dead, stale, and definitely overused creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,"No suit, no thanks"
ySy8mcceTno,Gente... Eu me caguei
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there is more substance to the movie than there is with this trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh as somebody who loved marble hornets and watch both the original slender man movies I can tell you right now this is about to be a terrible representation of slenderman and at best will turn out as an ok movie unless the trailer is misleading
ySy8mcceTno,Nonce
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if Logan Paul will explore this place
ySy8mcceTno,When ever you see Sony you know it’s going to be a bad movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I bet his first appearance in the movie is going to be a jump scare
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, if you ruin this i swear to god"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,First the emoji movie and now this... Sonys running out of movie ideas
ySy8mcceTno,YES FINALLY A MOVIE BOUT HIM lol it’s so old tho how people know realize slender man is important
ySy8mcceTno,He really needs a tan
ySy8mcceTno,There is Mexican version of this with slender man in a SOMBRERO and Maraca “ Eh senior”
ySy8mcceTno,My naema pickle Jeff lol rawr XD
ySy8mcceTno,Good movie horror the best
ySy8mcceTno,"I have been waiting 5 years for this





It wasn't worth the wait"
ySy8mcceTno,Just a little too late just a little only like 6 years but you know thats ok it's not like slender man is going to be out dated in 6 years.
ySy8mcceTno,Fuc off mayn
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve rechafa
ySy8mcceTno,"""Walk in the woods"""
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like 10% of the movie is actually about the real story? The rest is just...random stuff. I know you can't make a 2h movie of one person running around in the forest only. But if you can't....How about you just...don't? I can already tell that this is going to be absolute trash and has nearly nothing to do with the actual thing.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so cheap sorry guys whoever the heck is playing as slender and whatever the girls name was that slender got to......yeaaaaaah i wouldn't really say its the best bet ause slender just looks like a man in an mask that's carrying two sticks and the girl looked like she just found out donald trump is a president when she saw him....like noke seriously what the heck
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell naw😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Too late and too soon at the same time
ySy8mcceTno,"Trailer wasn’t that good, movie will probably be worse than the trailer.  If they get lucky enough, it could be a short scene in Boo 3 or Scary Movie 248"
ySy8mcceTno,YOU CAN'T SEE ME I'M JOHN SLENDER
ySy8mcceTno,Little late. And the picture at the end when it’s over is the only time you see him fully
ySy8mcceTno,IM SO GOING TO SEE THIS
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is a genius
ySy8mcceTno,"Cliche horror crap, doesn’t really look too unique, I’m hoping I’ll enjoy it, though I’m very doubtful at this point"
ySy8mcceTno,"#CanYouSeeHim well, not really, this is just a trailer and didn’t even see his “face”"
ySy8mcceTno,Why didnt they keep the OG Slender man style
ySy8mcceTno,This literally looks like a rehash of the Bye Bye Man.  Doesn’t look like they brought anything new or interesting to Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,so creepy
ySy8mcceTno,this is probably one of those jump scares = scary type movie
ySy8mcceTno,*i feel like there going to make movies on creepy pastas after this movie is on the big screens*
ySy8mcceTno,"I personally can't wait to see this. And ignore all these bakapervs saying ""6 year's late"" and how he's been forgotten, THAT'S WHY YOU MAKE THE MOVIE!! SO HE CAN BE REMEMBERED AGAINNNNN"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like an ad for ""American Horror Story: Slender Man"""
ySy8mcceTno,America so fat that a slender man scares the children.
ySy8mcceTno,Poop
ySy8mcceTno,"R u joking
SERIOUSLY"
ySy8mcceTno,And another great idea made by creative people flushed down the toilet by movies producers
ySy8mcceTno,"If this movie does alright/Good
We all know what's happening next


Jeff the killer"
ySy8mcceTno,Ok I'm not trying to offend anybody with this trailer looks horrible I love Slenderman I love the franchise but this movie looks horrible it looks like the beginning of American Horror Stories
ySy8mcceTno,its about time
ySy8mcceTno,The roblox version is better
ySy8mcceTno,Puros americanos >:'v no hablan español
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they did some research
ySy8mcceTno,WHY 13K DISLIKES?!
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man be like"" you can't see me""👀"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dosent look too good. They'll try for psychological horror no doubt but it'll probably fall flat with the overuse of random, slightly disturbing images with no correlation to the actual plot."
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff where u at boi
ySy8mcceTno,I used to be scared of slender man but now i know what slender means(skinny/thin) so now i think about him as skinny man or thin man
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to laugh at thus in theaters
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypastas from 2013
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like the trailer for a cheap anthology series were the episodes have no connection to each other. Kinda like a poor's man Channel Zero (and that's working on a tight budget)
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine a creepy pasta cinematic or extended universe :0
ySy8mcceTno,Put it away please
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s Logan Paul so we could record it!
ySy8mcceTno,The one thing I wasn't expecting
ySy8mcceTno,I’ll take movies that came out 7 years too late for $600 Alex
ySy8mcceTno,"Alright, I see the problem. Four girls in high school. Having it set in town instead of forests abandon buildings and mines would have been better. Like found footage of a teenager group running from him would be cool. But a virus? Really?"
ySy8mcceTno,A logan paul movie? That's cool
ySy8mcceTno,"A full length trailer that has no meaning. Not a good sign,"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man<JOHN CENA
ySy8mcceTno,pause at 1:41 you can see slender man!
ySy8mcceTno,We making movies about creepypastas now what's next Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"khe berga, ahora que sigue five nights a freddys la pelicula? van a arruinar la esensia de slenderman :""v"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is cute af ngl I'll Definetly let him smash
ySy8mcceTno,I CANT WAIT TO BOTHER MY TWO BRO BROS ABOUT THIS!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,God please don't tell me were gonna have a creepypasta cinematic universe
ySy8mcceTno,SO was that girl at the very last clip with the blue dress supposed to be sally??
ySy8mcceTno,I'm excited yet scared about this movie! 😂
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of rings a little bit 😂
ySy8mcceTno,You can't see me your time is now u can't see me the time is now
ySy8mcceTno,I bet slender man will have about 10 mins of screen time
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Jeff the Killer? Really stupid..
ySy8mcceTno,Yes I can see him he is right behind you :)
ySy8mcceTno,"So many people would LOVE TO SEE THIS....like, 6 years ago. smh and all of the ""The Ring"" style visuals are pretty old hat too. Also, a bunch of child actors in a horror film? It's not like _that_ won't make it suck incredibly hard. I can tell by this trailer that this movie is god awful."
ySy8mcceTno,Shroud anyone?
ySy8mcceTno,"Right on the ball again, Sony! Great to know we can count on you to make quality films based on all of our favorite current trends."
ySy8mcceTno,"*_Long, drawn-out, squeaky fart noise_*"
ySy8mcceTno,God such great potential wasted
ySy8mcceTno,The only good thing I can say about this is that at least we know that the movie industry is still *years* behind the internet. It's better they stay disconnected and unaware of present trends.
ySy8mcceTno,I used to be scared of Slenderman until a traffic jam and I realised that I had 5 cups of coffee and two bran muffins.
ySy8mcceTno,nest is gon be jeff the freaking killer
ySy8mcceTno,oof
ySy8mcceTno,Youre a Little late for this
ySy8mcceTno,They in the Logan Paul woods
ySy8mcceTno,Finally  they said oh it will come out in 2006 oh it’s coming out in 2013 oh it’s coming out in 2016 hell now it’s coming out in 2018 finally
ySy8mcceTno,Is it Gangnam style version
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDER MAN              6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Yay a slender Man movie. I am so happy
ySy8mcceTno,Lol :D
ySy8mcceTno,They’re just running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"Please stop putting mini trailers in front of trailers, Thank you"
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,GAY
ySy8mcceTno,"Boss: OK, we are out of original ideas and we are open to suggestions. We need a movie that is unnecessary, super lame, and will go straight to DVD.
Director: I got it!"
ySy8mcceTno,Idubbbz slenderman gangnamstyle
ySy8mcceTno,bro 1:50 scared the crap out of me
ySy8mcceTno,What about marble hornets the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,ohh dios mio tengo la polla tan dura que puedo partir marmol ahora mismo
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait to watch this!!
ySy8mcceTno,this would have been a good idea 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepy pastas are gay
Jack the killer is gay 
Slender man is gay"
ySy8mcceTno,Khe verga
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Men is still a thing? I forgot about it like five or six years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,this would have been a good idea if it was made 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,That eye thing made me cringe so very much
ySy8mcceTno,"He went from a creepy pasta, to a horror game, to a meme... then he disapeared for a while... but now he’s back in movie form!"
ySy8mcceTno,ɪ ᴄᴀɴ'ᴛ ᴡᴀɪᴛ
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god
ySy8mcceTno,"Not only is this like...a million years to late, but the story line doesn't even look that good. Plus (there was only a glimpse) that didn't even look like slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,Do not read this comment
ySy8mcceTno,"You're about 5 years late, Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,"Might be good 




Might be horrible"
ySy8mcceTno,This is real?
ySy8mcceTno,"a bit TOO late... i dont even understand the point of this trailer, whats exactly happening in this movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,We need Doki Doki literature club the movie
ySy8mcceTno,cant wait for the followup ben drowned creepypasta: the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Its sad america is at this point where we freely show a movie based on pure pure evil.
ySy8mcceTno,Ok then....
ySy8mcceTno,SPOOOKY
ySy8mcceTno,"This is so lame I can't believe they're actually gonna try this. If it ends up being good, I'll be surprised"
ySy8mcceTno,Nani?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman? Where is The Emoji Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Old white Sony people: Hey this is what kids are into nowadays, right? Btw, happy new year 2012!"
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao Sony's new rival is Disney 😂 😂 😂
ySy8mcceTno,This ether be a ok movie or terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, the minecraft movie that we've been waiting for! Looks like it will focus on enderman too, sick!"
ySy8mcceTno,Fake movie its not made by the company of the slenderman creepy posta and in the game its gives u 9 sec to run or hide and in the movie its 3 sec and ther is 9 pages instead of 8
ySy8mcceTno,horror movie industry is running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,Now they really are out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,The game has been out for years and they barely started on making the movie 👋boi
ySy8mcceTno,You better not screw this up hollywood.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wowo, I is shook"
ySy8mcceTno,he needs a suit. and my guess is that marble hornets will still top this
ySy8mcceTno,"We are starting 2018 great guys. 
It's a movie equal to the emoji movie"
ySy8mcceTno,try 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,The hell?
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember the creepypasta in 2013. Ya know, all the kids called it ""thender men"""
ySy8mcceTno,"this is gonna be awesome!, it takes me back to the good'ol creepypasta days (I know they still exist, they're just not a big thing anymore)I AM a bit dissapointed by the fact that you made his head all weird, if he was the classic, white-headed slenderman then it would be an awesome throwback, but I kinda feel like it is fair if you make his face look like that, afterall, slenderman the classic wouldn't look as scary to people who dont know about him, so yeah I guess it is ok if his face looks like a generic horror monster, but aside from that, I hope this movie lives up to the slenderman's legacy








ps:also, please tell me you will mention the psycho girls who stabbed someone from their school, that would make this the best movie ever"
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,Hehe.
ySy8mcceTno,WaIt IsNt ThIs GaMe DeAd
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I have a feeling that this movie is going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,A NOO MAMES LLEVO ESPERANDO LA Película desde el 2009 donde eran chidos los Creepypastas :v
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,The game was scarier this movie is gonna be lame
ySy8mcceTno,2018 v:
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok if I were to make a slender man movie I wouldn’t let all the victims to just kill themselves. I would make it almost like they kill people, not because their crazy, but because they want to save either themselves or their loved ones and the protagonist is one of those victims. He/she is trying to please slender to keep him at bay until he/she figures a way to kill it, banish, please it to make it break the bond and move on or escape it entirely. Some victims would be tormented in nightmares and would be sick and puke; maybe go crazy. This would lead them to stuff like anti-biotics to kill themselves to conceal the creature. Because if people just kill themselves, it’s a bit lazy. I want slender man to be smart, slow and patient. I even want him to be unpredictable not like every other ghost which is obvious and leads to a jumpscare. I want it to be like a spider due to its tentacles. The woods are it’s web and once you touch it it’s attached to you until you get it off. I was inspired by an app to make the mouth open, like the mouth of the zoom on the flash. The ending will be a battle that’s fast yet slow focusing on the protagonist and the bonded family in pairs on each section of the house making traps yet noises to make it seem their still in the house and lure the creature. Then one group encounters the creature which will be unknown as the cuts from group to group looking at the darkness. Building tension to who’s going. Once they know where the monster is (the monster WONT teleport in my version) they find the exit to the house getting in the car to escape while the creature thinks their hiding in the house suffering all the traps to realise their gone leading the creature to use its long legs to run and chase the tracks the family can’t outrun it that’s how it catches up so they shoot it to slow it down. Anyway I’ll give this movie a chance. My film will only have one jumpscare which will be for someone who has heart problems the rest is actual creature activity"
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,RIP slender games Sony has the rights now.
ySy8mcceTno,"If Slenderman is just a shadow in this film, than that’s ridiculous"
ySy8mcceTno,S.C.P. Movie
ySy8mcceTno,I think i got a half Chub
ySy8mcceTno,"I dont think the guy who made this did much research lol. The appeal of slenderman was that it wasnt your stereotypical horror cliche, and this movie wreaks of stereotypical hollywood horror."
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,Good fucking god the editing looks like theyre trying too hard to look scary
ySy8mcceTno,"but what if slenderman wanted to settle down and start a family..., coming this fall to abc family The Slendermens"
ySy8mcceTno,"All this loud noise, in your face bullshit isn't scary."
ySy8mcceTno,I sleep.
ySy8mcceTno,Would be a lot scarier if it were about those kids who killed a kid and blamed it on Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"This is going to be a legit movie?
Great, creepypasta's are now worth being movies..."
ySy8mcceTno,Bet you we only see Slenderman for like 5 min of the whole movie
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff The Killer Vs Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,This movie can be the worst movie ever... but it’s slendy... soooooo I’m excited anyway and gonna love it. They need to make more creepypasta movies lol
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t see why people think it’s only okay to enjoy things if it’s currently socially relevant.
ySy8mcceTno,"How to defeat Slenderman
1. Wear a mask.
2. Tell him ""you think darkness is your ally?""
3. Break his back."
ySy8mcceTno,the beginning gave me stranger things vibes I dunno why XD
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,Well if they are going to make a Slenderman movie they might as well make a FNAF movie!
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time.
ySy8mcceTno,"brought to you by the creators of the emoji movie
That one skinny dude"
ySy8mcceTno,edgy
ySy8mcceTno,on what day???
ySy8mcceTno,Finally! I've been waiting for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Sony Pictures has done a lot of horror movies like slender man and the emoji movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"first: Photoshop work
second: creepypasta
third: video game
fourth: a movie"
ySy8mcceTno,2008 has returned..
ySy8mcceTno,I’m surprised I didn’t see Logan Paul in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,The only way a Slenderman movie would kinda work is if it were some dada stylistic thing.
ySy8mcceTno,Only 5 years too late. Good job Hollywood
ySy8mcceTno,Was expecting Logan Paul in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"A puta, la wea penca, esperaba que fuera el Slenderman del Marbel Hornet o algo así, pero no es el Slenderman penca de los juegos.  puta mierda

use google traductor for read this."
ySy8mcceTno,This would’ve been good 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was a well made fan trailer.... not high hopes
ySy8mcceTno,You missed the boat on this one when those two girls killed for the Slenderman...
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man : I’m coming for u!
Instead: what up boi!😂"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie just became the most anticipated movie of the year......whoops, *for* the year of 2012, of course"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,#saveSML
ySy8mcceTno,"All I can think about is that poor girl that got stabbed up. I hope she doesn’t see this trailer, that’s a lot of trauma"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no another one
ySy8mcceTno,Sweet 2011/13 memories
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Why!!!! Sony why
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems too late on the popular party craze, although it is really interesting to know that they, Sony,  finally made an official Slender Man movie. My only concern is if they'd manage to mimic and bring that ""eerie static"" tone of horror that the Slender Man creates when his victims see him.  Also that they give some bits of iconic information about how he existed. (Hopefully referencing the web series Marble Hornets) 











Regardless of how sort of vague this trailer was from the start, I feel like this could potentially be one of the greatest horror films that Sony made yet!


























If we're lucky, we might have a chance to see other classical  creepypasta horror movies like Rake or the S.C.P Foundation."
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too fucking late hun!
ySy8mcceTno,Im going to make a prediction that this movie is going to be filled with cliches
ySy8mcceTno,#outofideas
ySy8mcceTno,From the makers who brought you The Emoji Movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't play Roblox, but this movie will definitely make that Slenderman game the most played."
ySy8mcceTno,*Dragon Ball Evolution Flashbacks*
ySy8mcceTno,Please no
ySy8mcceTno,Now if only they decided to make this movie when the Slenderman games were the biggest thing
ySy8mcceTno,WHAT
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es real?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a freshman in film collage made this
ySy8mcceTno,"welp this finally exists, and you bet its gonna suck"
ySy8mcceTno,1:21 insert random maggots for extra shock entertainment. Thanks sony pics
ySy8mcceTno,Seems fine it be better if it shows how slenderman does to the bidy like how he eats them or sum thing
ySy8mcceTno,Cool...But you guys do realize that it's 2018 right? Your kinda late for this one.
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for that Minecraft movie to drop
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY ITS HERE!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this is a pretty shitty trailer........ nothing but a bunch of girls screaming......

I kinda expected a bit of ""plot"" if that's a thing now"
ySy8mcceTno,When she stuck the knife in her eye I legit grabbed my own eye ughh 😱😵
ySy8mcceTno,Well ... where's Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,"Even though you thought the emoji movie was trying to be hip and modern with the internet crowd, this happened..."
ySy8mcceTno,MY CHILDHOOD IS COMING TRUE YASSS
ySy8mcceTno,Heck yeah! Slender-man is actually going to be on the big screen by a big company!
ySy8mcceTno,Humming the ‘friends’ theme song oddly helps a ton
ySy8mcceTno,Well....
ySy8mcceTno,7u7❤
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,Looks decent I'll give it a try
ySy8mcceTno,When i watched the trailer I thought of Logan Paul in the suicide forest.
ySy8mcceTno,They are finally making a movie about my favorite mythical creature
ySy8mcceTno,Pls stop trying to make this creepypasta garbage relevant again. It was stupid in 2013/14 and still is nearly 4 yrs later
ySy8mcceTno,isnt sender man sexy?
ySy8mcceTno,THAT MOVIE WAS FILMED IN MY HIGH SCHOOL! I KNOW THAT CLASSROOM THEY SHOWED!
ySy8mcceTno,Que loco v:
ySy8mcceTno,"hmm, maybe good maybe bad, we'll see"
ySy8mcceTno,Hiding in the comments?😫
ySy8mcceTno,Is Sony getting this desperate?
ySy8mcceTno,2018 just turned bad
ySy8mcceTno,If slender man gets you at least your buddy Logan will find you trust
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are about 6 years later with this one...
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no time for the slender fetishes to come out again
ySy8mcceTno,Are you kidding me? This CREEPYPASTA game has a Movie called: SLENDERMAN?! SERIOUSLY?!❓❗️❔❕❓⁉️‼️
ySy8mcceTno,Ben: Slender man....Slender...Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time.
ySy8mcceTno,In won't be able to sleep again
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait for Vegeta's ultra instinct
ySy8mcceTno,Plus this is dead now. The meme and everything
ySy8mcceTno,We need five nights at Freddys
ySy8mcceTno,I'm excited af
ySy8mcceTno,Bad movie already. Every movie based off a game is trash. ALWAYS.
ySy8mcceTno,I take shits scarier than this.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally. I mean kinda been waiting a while for this. So this is long overdue. Not counting the cheaply/kinda decent made ones by other people.
ySy8mcceTno,He's been plotting a terrible movie since 2013.
ySy8mcceTno,"FNAF Movie now, please."
ySy8mcceTno,I think it's a little too late for this.
ySy8mcceTno,"THEY DID IT.


THEY MADE THE MOVIE OF MY CHILDHOOD FEAR"
ySy8mcceTno,Seems pretty gud
ySy8mcceTno,No es por hater pero ya se me hizo una porqueria
ySy8mcceTno,0:39 he is to the right of the girls head
ySy8mcceTno,BRANDON INGRAM!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I have read the creepypasta story but I don't remember it that well but based on the trailer does this movie seem like it follows the source material?
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao they be making movies outa anything
ySy8mcceTno,They better give us some of the proxys of slendermans
ySy8mcceTno,Better hire the dude who played the lady mama from the movie mama SINCE HE IS SO GOOD WITH TRANSFORMATIONS
ySy8mcceTno,Walked in the woods and found.....SLENDERMAN!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't wait for the sonic.exe movie
(sarcasm)"
ySy8mcceTno,You can’t be telling me this is real.
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when people played this game and their scared reactions. Good times.
ySy8mcceTno,it’s back
ySy8mcceTno,0:58 how it feels to chew 5 gum
ySy8mcceTno,Why there very much dislikes?
ySy8mcceTno,Why tf is he growling?
ySy8mcceTno,“Tall boys 😩😘🤤”
ySy8mcceTno,Looks promising. But Slender man ain't gonna be in this movie when I'm done.
ySy8mcceTno,Con el trailer me basto para ver que arruinaron todo a slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell yeah...
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,lol what
ySy8mcceTno,"YESSSSSS


DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I HAvE BEEN WAITING FOR A MOVIE ABOUT HIM???? 


11 YEARS BOYYY"
ySy8mcceTno,next horror movie: found a DeAd BoDy In ThE SuIcIdE FoReSt
ySy8mcceTno,SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP
ySy8mcceTno,I've no doubt hollywood will make another completely un-scary film which relies on jump scares instead of atmosphere and the unknown.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender men is white not black
ySy8mcceTno,Cada año dicen que van a sacar una película de Slenderman o de Jeff y por más teasers que salgan nuna hacen nada
ySy8mcceTno,I'm still laughing at 1:33 when that girl stabbed herself in her eye and popped blood on the other girl😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"You're like five years late, guys. Slenderman is long dead."
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, its like another ring movie... i mean, boo! i Scrd you"
ySy8mcceTno,Was this shot where logan Paul visited?
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Logan Paul is featured in this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry but I’m in 2018 and you guys are in 2014 like..... really?
ySy8mcceTno,I like it splendor man.. excellent
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is going to mess this up so badly
ySy8mcceTno,WHYYYYY STOP IT...GET SOME HELP
ySy8mcceTno,Happy rusev day everyone🙌
ySy8mcceTno,2:22 Ender man that's some spoopy shite
ySy8mcceTno,This is fr
ySy8mcceTno,"This was just a photo for a photoshop contest, now its a full blown movie...Wow good going slenderman, from the bottom to the top."
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks alot Sony now there are gonna be more 12 year old girl's being stabbed while playing hide and seek. :D Welp imma go hide in a basement so i won't get stabbed... Bai!
ySy8mcceTno,"Ohhhhhhh no...


OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
ySy8mcceTno,The ring with a tall creepy shadow man in it.
ySy8mcceTno,"The director has made a bunch of bad films and the only horror film he's made is the 3rd installment of the ""I know what you did last Summer"" franchise which was Direct-to-Video. I like the idea of a Slender Man film. Problem, this kind of looks like y'all are about to lose the license so you're throwing a film together with no budget. Doesn't inspire confidence."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a creepypasta made into a movie thank god
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh look another jump scare movie, only this time it has BRAND RECOGNITION!"
ySy8mcceTno,Still don’t know how I feel about a Slender Man movie but it can’t be that bad right?
ySy8mcceTno,"Primero emoji the movie y ahora esta mierda?
Que sigue,una película de gayluma?"
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know how to feel about this
ySy8mcceTno,After Year and years and years finally got a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"From the people who brought us: the terrible Flatliners remake, the terrible ghostbusters remake, the emoji movie, pixels... I don’t have much hope in this film  and by the way, I think this movie comes 6 years too late."
ySy8mcceTno,I want slender man gangnam style ples
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t worry it’s just Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so excited for this
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna be hella lit
ySy8mcceTno,wow that looks terrible. shitty trailer
ySy8mcceTno,OMG YESS I LOVE SLENDER MAN SO MUCH I NEED THIS MOVIE NOW!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Just as I rewatched the case of the girl getting stabbed by her friends....
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman? Whats next! DOKI DOKI!?
ySy8mcceTno,Please tell me this is not a real one because if the real slenderman finds out we are all doom
ySy8mcceTno,Where's Emoji Movie 2?????
ySy8mcceTno,gay
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I am so pissed this latterly is nothing like the actually slender man story like leave!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Should have been made by the team that made It Follows. Too much flashy imagery imo
ySy8mcceTno,Ok but did they find the 8 pages tho
ySy8mcceTno,what? slenderman died in 2014 just stop.....
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Logan Paul in this trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,This better have some correspondence to the video game or i'm walkin outta the theatre.
ySy8mcceTno,Now all we need is a live action movie on the creepypasta 1999.
ySy8mcceTno,"uM, WHAT?"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks crappy
ySy8mcceTno,What is this? 2011 :v
ySy8mcceTno,Ewww this movie is for emo’s
ySy8mcceTno,Is the worst fan made....
ySy8mcceTno,I think you're about 6 years too late to be making a Slenderman movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"wow this looks like it completely misunderstood the concept of slender man
can’t wait to see Hollywood trash something else"
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the gay elephant
ySy8mcceTno,Not scary
ySy8mcceTno,Wth 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Ich hab den Slenderman einmal in echt gesehen kein Witz auf mein Kanal Beweise
ySy8mcceTno,"what's next jeff the kiler?, ben drowned?, the reik?, eyeless jack?, laughing jack? or red of godzilla of nes? :v"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks creepier than the boy
ySy8mcceTno,What about Masks and video cameras? Urgh Marble Hornets did it WAY better!
ySy8mcceTno,when there’s no chipotle by where you live at
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this giving me Stranger Things vibes when will goes missing
ySy8mcceTno,like this movie wouldve been good years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Did the original creator(s) of the Slender Man game give Sony Pictures Entertainment permission to use their original character, and will they be compensated? Cause I'm getting the feeling that Corporations don't even have to ask before they use someone's intellectual property anymore."
ySy8mcceTno,No la vayan a cagar poniendo al final que slender man se pega unos putasos con sherk alv y terminan peleando para salvar al universo y esas manadas...paro :v
ySy8mcceTno,Really hope they dont try to give Slenderman himself a backstory/origin
ySy8mcceTno,Creppypastas cinematic universe :v
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer sucks hopefully the movie wont






It most likely will..."
ySy8mcceTno,Were you *S P O O K E D*
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie actually looks dope. But so many children actually believe slender man is real. And with the two children who tried to kill their friend in mind, I don't think the making of this film was a good idea. I'd hate for there to be copycats after this is released...."
ySy8mcceTno,They're making a Five Nights at Freddy's movie if you guys didn't know.....so.....\:
ySy8mcceTno,Meh..looks confusing.
ySy8mcceTno,"You can tell by the trailer that there is no holding to the source material, they just took our Operator and made their own monster with his image"
ySy8mcceTno,"After I click at an interesting video - I tend to pause it, sit properly, then rewind it to re-watch.
Not this time, because the beginning is... ugh-phooey-pshaw! . . . Can't un-see it, and right before I go to sleep, great!"
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t look good..
ySy8mcceTno,From the people who brought you the emoji movie :)
ySy8mcceTno,lol can we get a ben drowned movie too? how bout a series for creepy pasta huh
ySy8mcceTno,Why not fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,YASS FINALLY <3
ySy8mcceTno,What is this 2014
ySy8mcceTno,"All the creepypasta ouo fans, go home."
ySy8mcceTno,This already looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,"whats happend sony?
After emoji the movie ...
It was not enough?"
ySy8mcceTno,Vaya 2014 en pleno 2017
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe he just wants to show his epic dance moves in this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,A movie should be made on the creature called “The Rake”. I would so go to see that.
ySy8mcceTno,*inserts pumped up kicks*
ySy8mcceTno,Its been a long time
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not sure if any one remembers marble hornets, but if you do then Sony should put them in this or if they make sequel or a prequel  then they should put them in."
ySy8mcceTno,I know its a trailer but boi I didn't even see him that clearly. Plus his face is black.dose he even have a suit on.
ySy8mcceTno,Night Mind are you here? I summon you!
ySy8mcceTno,If they made this then I'm going to make my own horror movie. How about shriek and the bee movie combined?
ySy8mcceTno,😨
ySy8mcceTno,Is the game slender man and find all eight pages in a forest and don't look at him and run
ySy8mcceTno,hallelujah
ySy8mcceTno,Sony always makes the cheesiest movies.
ySy8mcceTno,"I would see this if Henry Zebrowski did the narration, and just read Slender Man erotica the whole time."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony... Pls no
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if they can do all of the creepypasta into movies.
ySy8mcceTno,Came hear looking for a Marble Hornets esq experience left with shitty gore fest that kids call horror
ySy8mcceTno,Copyright yo creepy pastas and make bank
ySy8mcceTno,"oh no, OH NO, OH NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,"They really running out of ideas, huh?"
ySy8mcceTno,Do they know this game died years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait not to see this!
ySy8mcceTno,*H* *E*  IS W?T%CH8ING
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets did it better. I miss Troy and his camera
ySy8mcceTno,I'm hoping this movie will be like Slender: The Arrival. Because that game was goooooood
ySy8mcceTno,god this is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,My 9 year old self would be shitting his pants right now if he saw this😭😭
ySy8mcceTno,Is like to the  ring (movie 2002)
ySy8mcceTno,"Incoming suicide deaths from kids thinking this movie is based on a ""real thing""."
ySy8mcceTno,Still don't get why they didn't make this a found-footage film
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be fun to watch
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah, yes. A hollywood cashmash that won’t be scary in the slightest. No longer will the terror of seeing the slender staring you down exist in media, as, instead, we don’t see the shlong-er man for more than half a second at a time before we quickly pan to either h e a v y b r e a t h i n g or a totally different scene! 
Oh, and Slinky-man is undoubtedly going to be attatched to some high school girl getting killed way back in newspaperland under s u s p i c i o u s  c i r c u m s t a n c e s.
And one final thing, does sprinkle-man work part time as a chimneysweep? He looks as if he’s had a bad run in with a used ashtray salesman."
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie probably will suck, but I'm not gonna jump on the hate bandwagon with only a trailer to Judge 😂 I guess we'll see if it's good when it's released."
ySy8mcceTno,You missed the hype by a few years
ySy8mcceTno,did she just got rape in the end?
ySy8mcceTno,Feliz 2012 V:
ySy8mcceTno,If only it was Logan Paul's dead body in that forest...
ySy8mcceTno,Chills down my spine.
ySy8mcceTno,Coming 2019: SMILE.JPEG
ySy8mcceTno,"My middle school self would’ve been going nuts out of excitement for this. Myself nowadays? Eh.



I posted a music vid on my channel today, I’d love to hear your thoughts <3"
ySy8mcceTno,Sinceramente no le veo mucho futuro a esta pelicula aunque bueno espero que sea una buena película...
ySy8mcceTno,Hey he’s just a slender man
ySy8mcceTno,The gay elephant sounded great. I wish they could go back to calling it concrete giraffes though.
ySy8mcceTno,"Every criticism I’ve seen so far is stupid. “6 years too late, bud.” Yeah okay, but the thing with urban legends, is that you can make a film based on it, even if it’s past the time the legend saw most of its fame. So that comment is pointless. And I’ve seen a surprising amount of “This studio made the Emoji Movie, so you know it’s gonna suck!” Well, the studio that made Trolls also made How to Train Your Dragon and Shrek, and the studio that made Cars 2 also made Inside Out. So nice try. To me, this movie looks very good. And I mean visually. Didn’t catch much plot or what they’re going for there, so I’m not gonna judge it. I really hope this does well."
ySy8mcceTno,eso mismo dijeron desde el 2013 :v
ySy8mcceTno,This look like a good Pixar movie 😂
ySy8mcceTno,mmmmmm many scenes reminded me The Ring movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is John Cena You can't see me
ySy8mcceTno,Now all we must wait for is Five Nights At Freddys The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Where the fuxk is jeff.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks absolutely horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Sonny fucked up on this one
ySy8mcceTno,Cool fact: The Guy Who played The crooked man in The conjuring 2 movie ia going to play as slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,YES! Finally a Slenderman movie ! I've been waiting for this moment all my life!
ySy8mcceTno,not sure about this yet
ySy8mcceTno,ummmm... Isn't slender man like 7 years old?? Does it really need a movie 7 years later?
ySy8mcceTno,this looks ..interesting I guess
ySy8mcceTno,"great game, i just don't think it'll be a great movie. he's better t supposed to ""mess with your head"" he just kills you pretty sure"
ySy8mcceTno,"im pretty sure i know what the plot is gonna be like : setting is in the past around maybe the 1980’s. starts with a girl who is experiencing visions and having dreams of a “ slender and tall man dressed in black”. one day she goes missing into the woods and the parents inform the police. then all of her friends that have also seen visions are being killed one by one by some sort of “force” that is controlling them. while this whole time the police are searching for the girl, some police men are killed by slender man. the main cop is left to find the girl by himself but turns out the girl is in a whole other dimension with just her and slender man ( a little like the upside down from stranger things ) the main cop is killed and the girl is possessed as slender man takes her body which means slender man is now in her body ready to kill anyone of guard."
ySy8mcceTno,My mom is scarier than that smh
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Slender himself? At least a small glimpse but nah
ySy8mcceTno,Finally over fucking years a movie of slender man is making
ySy8mcceTno,I just want jeff the killer in cinemas
ySy8mcceTno,This hoe gon be lit asf
ySy8mcceTno,Another movie to disappoint the fanbase great
ySy8mcceTno,Para cuando Dear David??
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? The girl with no eyes that would sit at the end of our bed if we didn't foward an email to 15 different friends
ySy8mcceTno,"does sony even have the right to this character?I really hope they don't.a slenderman movie could be great, but this doesn't appear too good.  I will stay optimistic...but movies are usually worse than their trailer.I hope they don't own it so someone could make a better one."
ySy8mcceTno,Who else has been wishing for this forever?!
ySy8mcceTno,Like si hablas español :v
ySy8mcceTno,I think I’ll stick with Marble Hornets for Slenderman (Operator) scares
ySy8mcceTno,Cancel it.
ySy8mcceTno,how are they supposed to record it?
ySy8mcceTno,OH HELL NO
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look that bad but we all know its gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,It's only seven years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Finally...
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is real y'all I saw him at the liquor store
ySy8mcceTno,This does not seem like it's gonna be a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 1:52 2:14 for anyone who says that Slender Man isn't in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,When does a girl get stabbed?
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Scary Terry The Movie that's all i want.
ySy8mcceTno,Rated PG I'm assuming??
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man movies am I right?
ySy8mcceTno,The fan films look better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony actually make this movie good
ySy8mcceTno,"After 6 years of the game, a movie! I never thought that would happen."
ySy8mcceTno,Can you see him
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman no esta tan bueno... La vrdd
ySy8mcceTno,4 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Por fin!
ySy8mcceTno,someone wanna buys some tickets?
ySy8mcceTno,honestly this is like the 8th time i’ve seen this Jake Paul suicide forest video
ySy8mcceTno,Dios mio que horror 😱
ySy8mcceTno,"My emo, creepypasta obsessed, middle  school self is coming out and she’s crying."
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve mala la peli
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Great your making movie based on a video game fine make a movie about Call of duty I DARE YOU
ySy8mcceTno,Dead meme.

ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy pasta
ySy8mcceTno,Sony presents the Creepyverse! OH BOI

ySy8mcceTno,وين سلندر مان بالموضوع
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting for five nights at freddys
ySy8mcceTno,Game or movie?
ySy8mcceTno,😨😨😨😨😨😈😈
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they made a movie about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This was a really good trailer but I really wish it was the classic white face-tuxedoed slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Your a couple years late, by a couple years I mean half s decade."
ySy8mcceTno,And Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,Don't forget Ben drowned!
ySy8mcceTno,I just hope it stays true to the source material
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie should have never been made. Shooting started when the ledgend was at the peak of it's popularity, so now it's just outdated."
ySy8mcceTno,It ruined my childhood horror hero.......
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait!  #energy overload
ySy8mcceTno,Where is slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"The best thing I can say about the trailer is that the cinematography looks great and some of the imagery is decently spooky. Other than that it seems to be following every predictable horror movie trailer cliché in the book. We’ve got the creepy laughing children, the jumpscare windup (where the music fades out and then a spooky thing jumps out), the works. I’ll reserve my judgement for when (or, rather, if) I see the movie, but expectations are pretty low. I don’t think we’re getting another It Follows or Get Out-level horror film.

As for whether or not it’s morally acceptable to release a movie like this after the stabbing incident, I’m quite mixed. For one, I don’t think an entire brand or character should be tainted because of a messed-up incident happening out of its control, but at the same time it’s poor timing to release a trailer like this after the recent sentencing of one of the girls involved, and the father of the victim has the right to be offended by something like this. There’s still an entire fandom that’s been waiting for this movie to be made for years, so delaying or cancelling it would only make people angry, yet it would also be somewhat disrespectful to not at least acknowledge those affected by the stabbing incident. Again, mixed."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm looking forward to Five nights at Freddies
ySy8mcceTno,At first I thought it was going to be about that incident where the girls attacked that one girl and left her in the woods but then I watched it
ySy8mcceTno,"""A Slenderman movie? I guess Hollywood really is out of ideas."" 

I'm just glad they didn't get Kurt Russel."
ySy8mcceTno,This will probably turn out like the emoji movie.
ySy8mcceTno,No one asked for this
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully they pay royalties to Jay Bauman and Mike Stoklasa
ySy8mcceTno,fnaf 1 has better  jumpscares
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late but appreciated
ySy8mcceTno,we need a jeff the killer movie next!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is nice man wtf is this. Ugh movie make everything look bad 0/10!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,sony yes
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim?
ySy8mcceTno,This is a joke...
ySy8mcceTno,When you’re late to the meme
ySy8mcceTno,tell me why the news report on the girl who got stabbed by her friends for slender man is going to play next
ySy8mcceTno,Bet it wont be slenderman but cgi-man
ySy8mcceTno,Why so many dislikes???
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no...
ySy8mcceTno,"Of course they went and did it, right? Man, Hollywood is so predictable."
ySy8mcceTno,WE NEED JEFF THE KILLER AND TICCI TOBY AND ALL OF THEM TBH I FLELWKWOWL
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,so are you working with tribetwelve and everymanHYBRID on this or are we not gunna let the people that actually were making dedicated content on this before involved...back when it was relevant they had the best stuff btw tribetwelve is still active while everymanHYBRID hasnt posted in a year but its been slow since the start.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Now we wait for Ticci Toby, BEN drowned, Jeff the killer and Laughing Jack"
ySy8mcceTno,Horrible trailer and the movie is probably gonna be even worse.
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/31g0YE61PLQ
ySy8mcceTno,"Опять говно...Даже трейлеру нечего показать. Могу представить, что там на выходе будет..Screen Gems не везет, они после Resident Evil на пару с Андерсеном съехали дальше некуда..."
ySy8mcceTno,Wait so is it bad to look at Slender man or is the only way stop him from hurting you/moving to not take your eyes off of him? The video games I've played kind of confuse me. I don't remember correctly.
ySy8mcceTno,slender man😍😍😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be so bad I can't fucking wait
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it might have been 2014 but 
did u hear about the 2 girl murder over slender"
ySy8mcceTno,When you know u messed up 1:42
ySy8mcceTno,Its about time they made this a thang
ySy8mcceTno,I was hyped when I first clicked the video..... then I saw the Sony logo
ySy8mcceTno,well... now I need a five nights at freddy's movie
ySy8mcceTno,well it’s about fucking time
ySy8mcceTno,"They really should have made this movie earlier and made by a different company. I mean, its about time we got a movie about a creepypasta but sadly its one that was more popular but ended up getting done to death in 2013 and is made by Sony, two things contributing to why I will never want to see it other than for the answer, how will Sony screw up this time?"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a great movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is not the slender man from the game
ySy8mcceTno,It's about fucking time... I'm looking at you too Emoji Movie.😒
ySy8mcceTno,Only 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks pretty disappointing it should be heavily based in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this is like 95% Psychological horror and like 5% actual horror unlike how this trailer is making it out to be....
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the letters though
ySy8mcceTno,Alv...
ySy8mcceTno,"I am aware that this movie is made by the same company as some other ... questionable films. But, to be fair, they also gave us MIB, Spider-Man, and Blade Runner 2049. All in all, I'm not entirely sure what to expect from this."
ySy8mcceTno,everybody dies in the end
ySy8mcceTno,I know one thing everybody will be slender man for Halloween
ySy8mcceTno,A bit slepticical on this... got a feeling it won't get as much praise
ySy8mcceTno,Handjob Cabin is scarier then this.
ySy8mcceTno,This is retarted fr lol
ySy8mcceTno,watch 30 min of the movie is ganna be fill er
ySy8mcceTno,Nice fan made trailer! 👍
ySy8mcceTno,i luv creepy stuff but i hate filler creepy stuff
ySy8mcceTno,I overheard rumors on Chucky v Slender man if this movie does well.
ySy8mcceTno,"Tbh, this looks like a boring movie though.."
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Why no this ruins the beauty of it
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,"""The Ring"" much??"
ySy8mcceTno,Is Logan Paul gonna vlog it?
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't fucking care, Sony. Good trailer, or bad, I really don't."
ySy8mcceTno,"You are late, 6 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,They even shown the end of the movie in the trailer. Why so much spoilers?
ySy8mcceTno,Ah dammit
ySy8mcceTno,Wow that’s gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,When the main character is only seen once in the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,"I didn't get it at first I mean when someone want to make a legit movie from an internet character,someone should consider the popularity of the said character,,as I heard from several people,slenderman popularity was high in 2012..... then I noticed the name of Sony,,,and I realized everything I mean they made that horrible movie about emojis,,,so yeah,,,,,but then again I am a big fan of slenderman and I hope that it would not be just to earn a few cash"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a slender man movie we waited for!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Alien isolation the movie next
ySy8mcceTno,What? you never stood next to a dead body before?
ySy8mcceTno,And then the main characters realized that if you just look at him he can't do anything
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god it’s real now
ySy8mcceTno,"Even if this movie is bad, this trailer is really effective"
ySy8mcceTno,This look boring
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os br???
ySy8mcceTno,https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=5s&v=YUKa7K5gA4k
ySy8mcceTno,Kids favorite horror show
ySy8mcceTno,Remember the Emoji movie.....
ySy8mcceTno,"See if this movie came out say, 5 or 6 years ago it may have been promising since slender was so big back then. Nowadays I feel he's been forgotten. No new games, no videos on sightings ""real"" or fake. Marble Hornets ended too last time I checked. He's just a distant memory now. The trailer itself looks pretty generic and cliche as well."
ySy8mcceTno,"First a story, then a videogame, now a movie what next an anime?"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,I knew the jumpscare would happen but I still got scared
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t worry all the scary stuff ends at 1:51
ySy8mcceTno,Well been waiting for this day when we first had rumours when the game came out. Even with the crappy films people made trying to do rip offs
ySy8mcceTno,The sad part is I'm actually going to see this
ySy8mcceTno,Now all we need is a fnaf movie and my life will be complete
ySy8mcceTno,I love the cinematography so much
ySy8mcceTno,wtf la esperaba 😱😱😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,"So...

Slenderman Is Freddy Krueger actually?"
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time
ySy8mcceTno,4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,y'all are about 5 years late on this honey.
ySy8mcceTno,This is the second movie then. watch the original one first on youtube its a great movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This is not how I’d create a Slenderman movie....
ySy8mcceTno,*Y* *A* *Y*
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like something Netflix would produce and call it a Netflix original.
ySy8mcceTno,Chill
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man Gangnam style???
ySy8mcceTno,Where the Zodiac Killer Movie at.
ySy8mcceTno,Fucking kms
ySy8mcceTno,This should've been made years ago when Slender Man was relevant...
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys epic69 here and I come from 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,Do you think that they will changed slender man’s looks or the backstory?
ySy8mcceTno,Why do they make him sound like a dying dog coughing up some rabbit it found in the back yard
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmm I really hope they do this right
ySy8mcceTno,Lets get ready for the ps4-exclusive slenderman game then...
ySy8mcceTno,......
ySy8mcceTno,Can not wait to watch
ySy8mcceTno,Looks boring tbh
ySy8mcceTno,4 years late to the party.
ySy8mcceTno,Who is slenderman? Can someone tell me his orgins.
ySy8mcceTno,Fucking NOPE! 😂
ySy8mcceTno,ya pasó de moda v: ese era del 2014
ySy8mcceTno,Stop it!! This is not funny!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Well it seems just another movie who director thought using scary images and loud noises is “terror”
ySy8mcceTno,It actually looks like they are trying to make something good
ySy8mcceTno,THIS 👏🙏 I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS! GO SONY ❤❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,I'm still waiting for a Sonic.exe movie
ySy8mcceTno,This could be a really good movie if they focus more on physiological horror then jumpscares/gore.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, stop"
ySy8mcceTno,"hey! ijoputa, no le ví el terno >:u"
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for a slender man movie since 2013!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is 7 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hell no, u tripping"
ySy8mcceTno,I guarantee there is no “find the eight pages” in this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting for a Slender Man movie since I first played the eight pages 6 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,literally had me shook asf
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf??? They should stop with the scary intro!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Only 7 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted SlenderTubbies not this
ySy8mcceTno,Man dis is so stupid they don't even know his real abilities
ySy8mcceTno,I thought we clearly buried this in like 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Great the thing that gives me nightmares is now a movie!
ySy8mcceTno,oh its 2013 I guess
ySy8mcceTno,Remember those girls that stabbed their friend because of slender man hope this movie doesn’t come off as inspiring to kids
ySy8mcceTno,More garbage from sony.
ySy8mcceTno,"Yay, another jumpscare -.-"
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like a really generic horror movie. Like, really generic..."
ySy8mcceTno,Cool trailer
ySy8mcceTno,i want to die
ySy8mcceTno,Might as well give it a shot.
ySy8mcceTno,No black people? No ticket... 🤔🖕🏾
ySy8mcceTno,So they finally did it.
ySy8mcceTno,OH GOD SCARY
ySy8mcceTno,Wasnt slender a 2012 thing and Not 2018?
ySy8mcceTno,"O Trailer tá topper, agora só quero ver como irá está o filme em sua forma final xD"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony if this is real you better pull this off
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman is so 2013 why the hell are they bringing it back?
ySy8mcceTno,StOoooOooOOooOoooP NO MORE
ySy8mcceTno,oOF YALL THOUGHT
ySy8mcceTno,but does he gangnam style?
ySy8mcceTno,Thank God for movie pass...This and truth or dare are racing to the bottom
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is four years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,what’s next? Five Nights at Freddy’s?
ySy8mcceTno,this is terrible. There was a girl tortured by 2 girls who “worshiped” this supposed “slender man” why make a movie about it :/
ySy8mcceTno,I already see hem so why or they making a move
ySy8mcceTno,I'm sorry but the trailer looks like absolute trash. Like 4% on rotten tomatoes trash
ySy8mcceTno,"What I don't understand is the original game was titled ""Slender"". My friends asked me to come over and play in the dark, they introduced the game to me as ""Slender"", at the time you could not predict what it could be except maybe assume a horror game or something scary. I played it and got scared and jumped out of my seat after turning around to check my surroundings trying to collect pages.

Sometime after the game got popular, people kept introducing it to the public as Slender Man, which literally takes the fear factor out of it. Wished the producers of this movie could've looked back a bit more and see that it was far more interesting just titling it as ""Slender"" instead of this ""Slender Man"" crap that most people butchered. If I had to re-introduce the game to some people, they'll just most likely say, ""oh is it just some scary man?""...My response, ""ugh, yea, pretty much!""."
ySy8mcceTno,YES!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I hate horror movies, but I have to see this. not because it looks good, but because it's Slendy; 7 year old me would kill me if I didn't"
ySy8mcceTno,"So ok are the making all fucking creepy pasta series and if so I can't wait for them to make a Jeff, Toby,Jane and all creppypasta characters"
ySy8mcceTno,Issa gunna suck
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be real bad. Can't believe this is an actual thing. A slender Man movie. Just think about that.
ySy8mcceTno,1:24 Oh Hi Mark
ySy8mcceTno,Where's da static
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone's already judging it the first ever pice of film the gave us came out yesterday so I'm not gonna be hater like most people and wait for when it ACTUALLY COMES OUT
ySy8mcceTno,wtf
ySy8mcceTno,no me gusto tu intro :(
ySy8mcceTno,Finally after all the games
ySy8mcceTno,I really want a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called. They want their creepypasta back
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted this movie a long time ago and it’s been so long and they finally released it. It’s been a little to long
ySy8mcceTno,"To anyone wanting to watch this: first of all, why? And second, just go watch Marble Hornets and EveryManHybrid right here on YouTube."
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope this will be good and not trash like the other ones
ySy8mcceTno,"they're seriously gonna go the generic possessed girl route, slenderman doesn't even do that"
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer needed more slender but I can't wait to see the movie!!
ySy8mcceTno,1:51
ySy8mcceTno,Mmm nose... Esta medio chafa
ySy8mcceTno,"O no pusieron suficiente esfuerzo en el trailer, o será una mala película, espero que sea la primera porque siempre he querido una pelicula de slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,Same trending page as Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Krillin is safe.
ySy8mcceTno,When does slender man come cause I ain’t gitten scared
ySy8mcceTno,I want to die plus a little late like years
ySy8mcceTno,NO WAY....CANR WAIT TO SEE IT
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/P0r_SaquxRc
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy, *_what could possibly go wrong?_*"
ySy8mcceTno,A *bit* late
ySy8mcceTno,"When I clicked on this video, this video has 2 million and 666 views, what a coincidence"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna be amazing!!!
ySy8mcceTno,looks more like an indie film
ySy8mcceTno,Yassssss
ySy8mcceTno,Benedict Cumberbatch is in EVERYTHING
ySy8mcceTno,Guys you’re 6 years too late

ySy8mcceTno,Hagan películas de todos los creepypastas :v
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting years for someone to make a slender man movie and WOW! Does this look shite. Looks as generic as they come :(
ySy8mcceTno,3 years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,How did they record him without the camera going fuzzy?
ySy8mcceTno,"I like the music in the beginning, eerie, but this movie could flop"
ySy8mcceTno,is this real life
ySy8mcceTno,I still think it is going to be better
ySy8mcceTno,Now we wait for Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Expected a Jenny Craig ad.
ySy8mcceTno,cringe
ySy8mcceTno,Annoying child in the movie so im not.gonna watch it. I hate children in movies
ySy8mcceTno,The game is better than the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I think they missed their chance on making this movie a few years ago while everyone was actually scared of slender, but that time is long past"
ySy8mcceTno,"Bruh, they finally did a slender man movie but I bet it’s gonna be shitty... it’s not even like the game. 😔"
ySy8mcceTno,Miss dubeil
ySy8mcceTno,2012 ResidentSleeper

ySy8mcceTno,That Will Be Rated R 16
ySy8mcceTno,Best Part At 2:39
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Sheat y this cancerous franchise
ySy8mcceTno,That high pitch whilse is so annoying
ySy8mcceTno,It's made by Sony so it will be bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"I want it to be a replica of ghost toast’s versions 

That would be awesome!"
ySy8mcceTno,this looks so shitty
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow...
The splender man is so funny......"
ySy8mcceTno,"feel like they did it wrong, this will end up as a movie where we will never really see slender man and annoy the fans."
ySy8mcceTno,So super hero movie?
ySy8mcceTno,This is probably going 2 be a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,Did we just find a dead body in the woods? - Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,"Most likely gonna be boring, but it'd be pretty fun to watch.



Of course my parents won't let me see this."
ySy8mcceTno,"Trailer seemed a little ""Thin"""
ySy8mcceTno,ECUADOR ❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm I hope Logan paul would star in this movie to die in the begining and hang from a tree
ySy8mcceTno,"*Sees tentacles*
I know where this is going"
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets was better
ySy8mcceTno,Flashback 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Seems quite over the top to me. The game is probably going to end up being scarier.
ySy8mcceTno,*loud sigh*
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a fan made trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Guys we all know the next horror movie is gonna be Five nights at freddy's Staring Markiplier (the king of five nights at freddy's)
ySy8mcceTno,Thought i saw a dead man in the opening shot of the woods.
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if Logan Paul will vlog all the suicides this movie will cause
ySy8mcceTno,the horror icon himself is back
ySy8mcceTno,"In case you didn't know, Slenderman was created by lovecraft"
ySy8mcceTno,just another shitty cgi horror banger...
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man be like:  ""YOU CAN'T SEE ME MY TIME IS NOW!!!!!"""
ySy8mcceTno,I thought they already made a slender man movie? Right?
ySy8mcceTno,Really? sony
ySy8mcceTno,Uh k
ySy8mcceTno,I hope some of his proxies are in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m intrigued and curious and I hope it’s good. I’ve lowkey been waiting for a slender man movie since like 2012. If this sucks, I won’t be mad, I’ll just be disappointed."
ySy8mcceTno,*No way...*
ySy8mcceTno,1999 movie plz
ySy8mcceTno,_wow_
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for Red Letter Media covering this!
ySy8mcceTno,YEEEESH
ySy8mcceTno,No tiene nada de eslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This is about to be badass
ySy8mcceTno,It better be good
ySy8mcceTno,"The only truly good media involving any version of the “Slenderman” is Marble Hornets. It has bad acting, sure. It may not be the highest quality, yeah. But was it still good? In my opinion, yes. Very much so. So much so that a “Movie” attempted to use its name for sales. And that movie sucked, not just compared to the original title it was trying to profit off of. Hopefully this movie matches it in any amount. But, it’s not even taking a clever approach in my opinion. It honestly looks like the Bye Bye Man. “Oh, it gets in your head like a virus!” Yeah, it sucked just as badly as a virus does too. 

I still hope this movie manages to be good though."
ySy8mcceTno,Do a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,6 Years To Late Man
ySy8mcceTno,Quien más piensa que Sony la va a cagar con esta película
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey slendy, I see you're getting your own movie.  
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Hope you're doing good with Splendor and Trender.  (^=^)
I'll see the movie when I can, good luck. I hope for the best."
ySy8mcceTno,If you guys were true fans of the game then you'd know in the game you'd die anyway. So this movie is probably just some exaggerated BS compared to the game
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't seem so scary
ySy8mcceTno,Could we just fucking not?
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting all this
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone needs to stop judging it by its cover for now. Let’s wait until the movie comes and see how it plays.
ySy8mcceTno,This is a creative crisis in a nutshell.
ySy8mcceTno,Shouldn't the trailer be scarier and exciting?
ySy8mcceTno,They gotta put Logan Paul in the credits.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks cool......
ySy8mcceTno,🖕😂💥🔫
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m a scary potato 🥔 
RAWWWWWWWWW"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like depression and anxiety is playing a big part.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell no...
ySy8mcceTno,I sure hope red letter media sues over creation of the slender man character.
ySy8mcceTno,Why? Just why?
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing is scary about this... Im starting to think that every scary movie that’s coming out is not as scary as it use to be in the 2004 etc..
ySy8mcceTno,This looks boring
ySy8mcceTno,Soy la única que habla español 🐰🐹🍓
ySy8mcceTno,Es una porqueria ese trailer 🙅💔
ySy8mcceTno,2012
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer was such a clusterfuck to the eyes. This did not make me want to see the movie, it made me want to take some aspirin for the headache it gave me. Do better next time, Sony, you're better than this."
ySy8mcceTno,If logan paul is in it they better have him laughing at a dead person
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing can beat the pure terror of the emoji movie.
ySy8mcceTno,is this going to be a legit movie?
ySy8mcceTno,i seen so many fan made trailers but slender man is going to be a movie.i see sony is making this movie so i really hope it will actually scare me and get me all spook.sony did made the emoji movie which was the worst movie ever but this looks really interesting in my opinion so i hope they make it really good.
ySy8mcceTno,What a shitty trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Yeet let me get on hard first
ySy8mcceTno,Finally I had been waiting
ySy8mcceTno,Woah so scary!
ySy8mcceTno,Flop arriving
ySy8mcceTno,Marvel hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,How do they have the rights to a character that was made up online?

Or
Shadow Thing vs SlenderMan cause they cause a virus in your head, make you draw things, go crazy and are associated with shadows"
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years too late. Waited til nobody talks about slender man anymore. That’s like making a movie on silly bands or Gangnam style
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for thid
ySy8mcceTno,ouch 2012 was a couple years ago

ySy8mcceTno,The father of the girl who was stabbed in the slender man tragedy is saying this movie is dramatizing a tragedy and is insensitive https://apple.news/AyTJsob6KShy8nGAzye3w9A
ySy8mcceTno,"Right after Logan Paul suicide forest video
It has a creepy forest with people going in and getting scared
And people committing suicide
Noice"
ySy8mcceTno,It was better if was added the pages and at the end of the trailer was the last page of noooooo and that moment Slenderman appear
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, not only is this years late, but you don't even see the antagonist in the trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,Their better be some children being ate in here. Would love to see the creation of slender man too
ySy8mcceTno,Is the movie industry really running out of ideas this quickly?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like garbage
ySy8mcceTno,THERE BETTER BE A PEWDIEPIE CAMEO
ySy8mcceTno,And a german medic was the main character
ySy8mcceTno,Next Year Sony will allow Slender Man to be in the CCU (Creepypasta Cinematic Universe) so he can join Sonic.exe is his war with Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,The first Creepypasta Cinematic Universe
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,I wish it was in Germany 1916
ySy8mcceTno,Slender mans tide pods were just kicking in
ySy8mcceTno,They are ten years late
ySy8mcceTno,"*Pulls out one earbud so i don't get too scared*
Edit: *puts earbud back in bc wack*"
ySy8mcceTno,I never thought that Sony would ever get this desperate.
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all like 5 years late on this
ySy8mcceTno,Omg after 5 years they decide to make the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man movie, now with only 2% slender Man."
ySy8mcceTno,"Making a movie about it after it was popular 
Makes sense"
ySy8mcceTno,OOF. i cant wait to see this now xD
ySy8mcceTno,Bet this is one is going to be conttoversial as hell
ySy8mcceTno,Eh esperado tanto por esto :')
ySy8mcceTno,Eh esperado tanto por eso :')
ySy8mcceTno,Ugh!! What the heck?? this is so dang late... if anything they should have done this years ago... what’s the point now? Are they just trying to be offensive and insensitive?! And to be honest this just looks like a really really stupid ripoff of It or Stranger Things...
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Slender will barley appear in his own movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if we'll see any tentacle hentai.
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets already got this covered smh
ySy8mcceTno,Sony... we almost forgave you for the Emoji movie after the Spiderman commercial... now this lol. We’ll see how it goes!
ySy8mcceTno,"Why does Slender look generic as all hell? What I found the creepiest about it was that he had a suit and tie, which brings him close to being human, but not quite. Right in the uncanny valley. Knowing that a monster in some way at one point was like you is, at least I feel, creepier than just a random gray thing. Giving him a bit more humanity and personifying him just a little would have been a great tool in dehumanizing him completely."
ySy8mcceTno,"Idk why people are mad at this
It looks good actually but thats my opinion"
ySy8mcceTno,Did they really make a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Cringe
ySy8mcceTno,You know its going to be a terrifying movie when its made by the same film company who made The Emoji Movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"Well even if the movie isn't scary, you can guarantee if I see this movie you'll see me crying in the corner afterwards. Anything even a little scary scars me for life."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman is only gonna be in this for like 5 min, max 10 min"
ySy8mcceTno,I want it to be good but we all know it will be mediocre at best.
ySy8mcceTno,it´s similars as fan film
ySy8mcceTno,"Yesss! I remember being so scared, locking my windows, shutting my door, not being able to sleep, I was so afraid. (Didn’t help that those two girls almost killed there friend a couple hours from where I lived) I can’t wait for this!! It’ll bring back so much memories!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Guess I'm the only one who found this absolutely terrifying 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,This looks kind of crappie
ySy8mcceTno,this looks god awful
ySy8mcceTno,finaly
ySy8mcceTno,finaly
ySy8mcceTno,dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,WHY
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all are milking this a little too late for my tastes....
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear editors, please make a Logan Paul meme out of this thanks you"
ySy8mcceTno,Look up stabbing story slender Man on news
ySy8mcceTno,I always thought am image of slenderman on the edge of a forest looking at children was so creepy. I really hope that have some shots like that. That actually LOOK creepy. But I doubt it.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a bad YouTube movie
ySy8mcceTno,But why make a movie about a shitty game 5 years after it's peak?
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys, it's made by Sony. They just want the cash from a trend that is already as ded as the victims in the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,CGI man
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this for so long
ySy8mcceTno,Hoping he has more screen time than it seems
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this remind me of candle cove
ySy8mcceTno,Do they not realize that people killed themselves and others because of this game that they should imagine how many people will die because of a movie????
ySy8mcceTno,He's last victim? What is that about?!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awul with these s-f effects
ySy8mcceTno,This looks stupid!! Disapointing!!he doesnt even look like slenderman and just ew
ySy8mcceTno,They based this off of a stabbing in Wisconsin
ySy8mcceTno,They based this off of a stabbing in Wisconsin
ySy8mcceTno,Dead filmed 5 minutes from my house
ySy8mcceTno,Just what we didn’t need
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late to the party bud
ySy8mcceTno,So epic! Great way to bring in the new year... happy 2012 everyone’
ySy8mcceTno,Wow 😮
ySy8mcceTno,"*puts out cigarette*
*lifts head*
S-Slender Man...? I haven’t heard that name in years...."
ySy8mcceTno,"ok but like, can there plz be cameos of the proxie? XD (Like ticci toby, etc.)"
ySy8mcceTno,Isso é que é filme de terror e creepypasta!
ySy8mcceTno,My biggest fear is the emoji movie 2
ySy8mcceTno,This is the shittiest trailer I have ever seen. Slenderman was only like 1/20th of the entire trailer lmao.
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMOJI MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Doc what time is it? Are we in 2013 agin?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony: ""lets make a movie on SlenderMan but let's not release it until like nearly 7 years after the craze has ended"""
ySy8mcceTno,If this wasn't Sony I would be excited.
ySy8mcceTno,"Plz don't ruin one of the things that got me into YouTube in the first place, Slender is my childhood"
ySy8mcceTno,I believe an SCP movie would be better in my opinion
ySy8mcceTno,"Marble Hornets is a better production than whatever this is trying to be. Curse you, Hollywood!"
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,The dude in 1:21 got turned on😂
ySy8mcceTno,Looks Lame.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty good :)
ySy8mcceTno,this doesn't exactly feel like a Slender Man trailer it feels more like teens with a black sickness killing themselves or driving them mad.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this even happening?
ySy8mcceTno,If this movie doesn't have a good back story/story line & soundtrack it will suck.
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for popeye >:
ySy8mcceTno,"WTF!!! Based on this trailer and the storyline I think I won't like it at all, I had so many expectations for this movie, a total waste of time! I hope I'm wrong"
ySy8mcceTno,For a second I thought this was stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,You should've let Slender Man die in 2013
ySy8mcceTno,I bet the trailer is better than the actual movie
ySy8mcceTno,When Sony responds to a trend *7 years later*
ySy8mcceTno,Latinos reportense con un like!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sabia lo sabia!!! Algun dia sacarian la película, espero y este admirable."
ySy8mcceTno,Should’ve tied in with marble hornets in some way. That first movie was pretty bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"THIS LOOKS TERRIFING
MORE SCARY THAN IT"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell yeah
ySy8mcceTno,If it isn't directed by the person who made slenderman and sony is the one taking control of the story then you know its gonna be bad
ySy8mcceTno,"No one thinks this is in bad taste? There is a victim of stabbing that has to watch this and relive it. Those little girls were crazy when they stabbed that other innocent girl, an now there is a film that is based off of what the suspects said. Building a mythology off of someone else's tragedy is pretty dumb."
ySy8mcceTno,as if pop culture hadn't ruined him enough
ySy8mcceTno,Only about 10 years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,"this can actually be good, first creepy pasta movie wohoo"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks alright
ySy8mcceTno,"No vi a SlenderMan.
¿Aparecerá Jeff The Killer? :v 
¡¡¿¿Que significa todo esto??!!"
ySy8mcceTno,How much you guys wanna bet this movie is gonna be ok
ySy8mcceTno,I thought that this was a joke
ySy8mcceTno,@Sony Y’all are a few years late to the party
ySy8mcceTno,1:26 *logan paul laughs*
ySy8mcceTno,"Llévelo esperando desde 2012 por esto :,D"
ySy8mcceTno,"Y la estática >:v 
si no ay estática no es slenderman >>:v"
ySy8mcceTno,"who else thinks this kinda looks like the ring

p.s. the ""real footage"" movie is probably better than what this will be"
ySy8mcceTno,"This nails nothing of the origin of Slender Man, nor the games based around him..........and you're also 7 years behind. Marble Hornets did a better job, GG, what's next, Amnesia The Dark Descent?"
ySy8mcceTno,Now we need a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,"It's okay, the comment section is safe :)"
ySy8mcceTno,Wanna be Freddy Krueger
ySy8mcceTno,"this better be good, and sony don't screw up the Legend of the Slender Man"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks abysmal.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman VS The Bye Bye man
ySy8mcceTno,"I think I can guess what'll happen in this movie:
Some children go missing in a small town. The protagonist is a detective who looks into it, looks at more ""creepy"" evidence of such like photos and drawings, a lot of lame jumpscares happening to other supporting characters. Then the cast heads to the woods and then they either get killed by Slenderman or go insane after ""killing"" him before it is revealed that slenderman survived. Either way, it's just a sequel bait ending and a poorly made one at that. Oh yeah, did I mention that Slenderman has 10 minutes of screen time tops!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Well





This is gonna suck"
ySy8mcceTno,"wonder if this is gonna be better than the fanmade movie, because the fan movie was spot on with how slenderman works Sony here's a tip play all the games and then make the movie I beg you not to make the mistake that the writers of Dragon ball evolution made i beg you.( the team of dragonball evolution had no idea what dragonball even was so yeah)"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow there only like 4 years late!
ySy8mcceTno,"If the notes don't actually show up in the movies
I'm gonna be mildly infuriated"
ySy8mcceTno,this was made in my home town i saw them filming it
ySy8mcceTno,"""Gimme 20 dollars  gimme 20 dollars"""
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this doesn't turn out to be drama.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes finally!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Happy New Year 2012!
ySy8mcceTno,hype
ySy8mcceTno,This looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man = woods = Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Wuau
ySy8mcceTno,Oh
ySy8mcceTno,You know it's going to be bad when you see the Sony logo
ySy8mcceTno,"I love creepypasta but this is by Sony, who made the frickin emoji movie and its already a marble hornets ripoff"
ySy8mcceTno,Your a bit late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,🤔....
ySy8mcceTno,O madre o verga que geniaaal:'v
ySy8mcceTno,Is it April Fools Day yet?
ySy8mcceTno,Why won't sony give us a date when th e movie comes out!!!😣
ySy8mcceTno,"This is gonna be like the emoji movie all over again, it’s gonna suck."
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like the creators of this film just mixed “Blair Witch” and “Rings” into one movie, Slender Man!"
ySy8mcceTno,hey sony you're about 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Monika is better
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this trailer is false why that is not slenderman if you want to make a movie that is good should see the creepypasta or slenderman games why if they do something like this they will win the hatred of the fans of this creepypasta and videogames There will be people who would like that movie they are doing but it will be people who do not know the video games and the creepypasta but the people who have seen the video games and the creepypasta will hate it
ySy8mcceTno,Just a whole lotta nope.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m guessing they didn’t include any dialogue to hide the terrible performances.
ySy8mcceTno,So...those rumors of 2012 where right.
ySy8mcceTno,"No seas mamón >:v!!!
Va estar bn vrgas la peli v:"
ySy8mcceTno,But will pewdiepie be in it?
ySy8mcceTno,great will be very good movie
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY I’ve been dying to see a Slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh they should've made it back then when it was popular but now I mean yeah most fans of creepypastas will go see it like me but to most people horror movies arent there cup of tea
ySy8mcceTno,2012
ySy8mcceTno,Shpuld have made it about the girls who killed their friend as a sacr8fice to slenderman because they believed he was real.
ySy8mcceTno,CHUCHA ESTOY GRITANDO KSKSKSKDKSKSMSKS
ySy8mcceTno,Amazing :3
ySy8mcceTno,omg 11k dislikes... was it so bad... or bcoz its creepy & scary?
ySy8mcceTno,weON ESTO ES UN SUEÑO O ME CAÍ DE BEBÉ?
ySy8mcceTno,I think they are a bit late on the trend
ySy8mcceTno,*HOW DID I GET FROM EMOJI MOVIE TO THIS?*
ySy8mcceTno,this is a few years late
ySy8mcceTno,"I lie...
nobody wants this"
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting years!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Wow never saw this coming
ySy8mcceTno,"Its nice to see people are making Creepypasta movies. Ben Drowned might a bit tough to turn into a movie seeing that its about a guy haunting a Zelda game, may need to do Jeff the killer next"
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t figure out how to put a gmail picture
ySy8mcceTno,A lot like Stranger things....Just me? Okay
ySy8mcceTno,Wow! Really happy to see The Recovered get a soft reboot
ySy8mcceTno,"Clicheman the movie.
Seriously with as many ""masterpieces"" (sarcasm for those who didn't catch it) this studio cranks out, I wouldn't be surprised if it walks the same beaten path of jumpscares and gore porn that too many horror movies take today.

Pass."
ySy8mcceTno,Holaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,"This trailer is actually pretty convincing. It isn't any of those ""jump-scare-a-second"" trailers. This film looks like it has actual build up, tension, good cinematography, and GREAT atmosphere and lighting.
I'm willing to give this the benefit of the doubt."
ySy8mcceTno,We needed this 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,CAN'T WAIT TO  WATCH IT!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,A movie that should’ve came out during 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Something that you don't know about this movie:
It's written by Victor Surge, the creator of Slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow...What about Jeff the Killer? Well, I hope they do Jeff next after this movie is out and with the DVDS and bluray dvd."
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing will ever beat the slender man YouTube clips
ySy8mcceTno,this will be good (???????
ySy8mcceTno,"So I see the creators of this film are going for the Luis Buñel style of film making, in the vibe of ‘Un Chien Andalou’. Yeah, nope! I’m good. Hard pass. 🙅‍♀️🚫"
ySy8mcceTno,Now all we need is a Jeff The Killer and Ticci Toby Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,The ending show the slender man word sounds like fnaf 4 trailer with the midnight bells
ySy8mcceTno,Whats with all the stock footage and bad sound effects? is this fanmade??
ySy8mcceTno,O-O wow really????
ySy8mcceTno,stranger things season 3 looks great
ySy8mcceTno,no
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que este chida v:<
ySy8mcceTno,"I think you're like,,, 7 years late but ok"
ySy8mcceTno,On my god what are they doing smh
ySy8mcceTno,"First Annablle, then IT, now Slenderman? Oh what's next, Bloody Mary?!"
ySy8mcceTno,No revivan modas muertas >:v slenderman ya murió xd
ySy8mcceTno,so far it's amazing but let's give it a chance
ySy8mcceTno,"NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE 
SO MUCH NOPE"
ySy8mcceTno,Si es real podría valer mucho dinero
ySy8mcceTno,That girl at 0:58 kinda reminds me of Jamie Lloyd from halloween 4 and 5
ySy8mcceTno,Few years too late m
ySy8mcceTno,I think you're about 6 years too late to be making Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY GOD YESSSSSSSSSSSS I'VE WAITED SO FREAKING LONG FOR THEM TO MAKE A SLENDER MAN MOVIE! THIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME
ySy8mcceTno,Seems just another bad adaptation like death note.
ySy8mcceTno,Wasnt sure if this was a parody or not. Til I saw it on iMDB.
ySy8mcceTno,https://soundcloud.com/seth-elkins/misery-original-song
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s his Tom Ford suit???
ySy8mcceTno,Yeahhhhhh baby
ySy8mcceTno,"I honestly feel like it could be better, but I'll just go to see because I've been waiting for this movie for far too long."
ySy8mcceTno,Something tells me this is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Sony Pictures needs to close already
ySy8mcceTno,"I would love to see more of a psychological thriller type movie and not one filled with jump scares. A movie somewhat like “It comes at night” or “It follows” where the real monster is rarely shown and it focuses on more on the mind of whoever is being hunted. I really hope this isn’t a let-down, but Sony is a little rough on this kind of stuff."
ySy8mcceTno,"Of course the same company that published the emoji movie.
You seem kinda late to the party with this one tho."
ySy8mcceTno,Espere tanto para que salga una película de eslender man
ySy8mcceTno,This movie needs to not if you want horror just go watch crypt tv they put out a few videos a week and their always amazing
ySy8mcceTno,I play Slender on ROBLOX
ySy8mcceTno,"calling it now, this will be the Transformer of horror movies"
ySy8mcceTno,"Por favor que no sea un asco la peli :""v"
ySy8mcceTno,Is Logan in this forest to
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer reminds me a little of the ring horror movie franchise it gives off that vibes
ySy8mcceTno,"Cool
Also I didn't see slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman!!!
ySy8mcceTno,It's not 2012 anymore
ySy8mcceTno,April Fools in 3 months away...
ySy8mcceTno,hmmm american phobia
ySy8mcceTno,Holy cow thus is cool can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,YOU RUINED THE FRANCHISE
ySy8mcceTno,This better be good
ySy8mcceTno,Trite and unoriginal.
ySy8mcceTno,I Literally just watched a slender related video Tf
ySy8mcceTno,"¿Solo yo creo que le exageraronde más, y están cambiando radicalmente la historia de slenderman?"
ySy8mcceTno,If Slenderman doesn’t have on a tuxedo I’m gonna be LIVID
ySy8mcceTno,oh hell no.
ySy8mcceTno,2:21 DUNDER MIFFLIN
ySy8mcceTno,"The company that made this film is filming a “Venom” film based one of Spider-Man’s most popular enemies ever known (anti hero such as Deadpool, and Wolverine. An anti hero is a someone who saves life by killing or even steals but still saves others like Catwoman) and Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, aka (also known as) Venom the most famous symbiote in Marvel comics, and Eddie will be going face-to-face with Carnage, (similar to Venom but skinnier and he is red instead of black)"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks trash lol
ySy8mcceTno,He just wants hugs
ySy8mcceTno,Did they even play the game
ySy8mcceTno,ABOUT TIME
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to 2012 ( i think )
ySy8mcceTno,Watch Logan Paul be a main character and he’s making fun of a dead body
ySy8mcceTno,This looks just terrible
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time. We waited to long.
ySy8mcceTno,5 años tarde hijos de puta.
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be sooooooo bad! I need it!
ySy8mcceTno,I have several questions
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t that already make one because I remember going to the playstation Storetm one time and there was like a slender man Movie there
ySy8mcceTno,"FINALLY! I hope this starts something. We need more creepypasta movies!!!!!!

JEFF THE KILLER NEXT PLEASE!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Lame af
ySy8mcceTno,Very good
ySy8mcceTno,This is cool but we need an SCP movie
ySy8mcceTno,WTF?
ySy8mcceTno,The Forest Official Trailer
ySy8mcceTno,THIS TRAILER MADE ME VERY CONFUSED
ySy8mcceTno,Alv slenderman :v
ySy8mcceTno,I absolutely love the poster at the end of the trailer!
ySy8mcceTno,We need a Russian sleep experiment movie ASAP
ySy8mcceTno,"Sweet, all of my childhood fears put into one movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman capturing peoples?
ySy8mcceTno,It’s gonna suck. amirite
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, No la vallas a cagar :v.."
ySy8mcceTno,Alguien que hable español :3
ySy8mcceTno,"All I can say is that as long as it doesn't have that bs ""We can stop him!"" or idiotic background like ""He used to be a farmer who was in love"" or whatever scary movies have been doing lately then I'm game. *pun intended*"
ySy8mcceTno,Hell. No.
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the whole Slender Man craze ended in 2012 when some girl almost got killed. Boy was I wrong!
ySy8mcceTno,Silent hill meets slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Well finally
ySy8mcceTno,My expectations are so low that Peter Dinklage couldn't limbo under them.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real
ySy8mcceTno,Yessssssss finily
ySy8mcceTno,Why does it show like a redbox movie???
ySy8mcceTno,Nikolai must not be drinking enough :)
ySy8mcceTno,They should make a Jeff the Killer film!
ySy8mcceTno,This comedy looks great!
ySy8mcceTno,"They're releasing it in January because they know it's garbage, just like the Bye Bye Man was last year"
ySy8mcceTno,"Solo puedo decir que almenos el trailer es simplemente horrible, espero que la pelicula no sea así"
ySy8mcceTno,If the title wasnt called slender man then i would have had no idea what this movie was about
ySy8mcceTno,It would be soooo cool if Sam and Dean Winchester could be in this movie 😥
ySy8mcceTno,I am really happy that there is a movie coming about Slender man... but.. you know... it's Sony Pictures...
ySy8mcceTno,Super
ySy8mcceTno,Ehhh it looks like they were in a budget
ySy8mcceTno,Lol Sony Pictures
ySy8mcceTno,This so scurry totally not sarcastic
ySy8mcceTno,If this isn't rated R I will not see this. Usaully pg13 scary movies are shitty jumpscare movies
ySy8mcceTno,For the next Creepypasta movie it should be jeff the killer played by that guy from the new Diary of a wimpy kid movie
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie that's worth watching 😁
ySy8mcceTno,"Plot twist, he’s not real"
ySy8mcceTno,next movie  *Slenderman v Jeff the killer*  yhea you know how it goes
ySy8mcceTno,I want a Jeff the killer or Marble Hornets too
ySy8mcceTno,I've waited my entire childhood
ySy8mcceTno,Y is there so many dislikes smh:(
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf It is movie on hungary top 10. LOL It is very nice movie. I have to see it is the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Br vai dominar o mundo!
ySy8mcceTno,OH BOI
ySy8mcceTno,ITS ABOUT FUCKING TIME I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS FOR THIS MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,I never thought this movie was going to happen
ySy8mcceTno,No iconic image of him standing in the distance FAIL!
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be one of the best romance movies of all time
ySy8mcceTno,will pewdiepie be in it?
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf this is a trick
ySy8mcceTno,Ya pasó de moda esta chingadera
ySy8mcceTno,HECK YES!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks good.
ySy8mcceTno,"I would say an ehh,they're 6 years late and looks like it will mostly focus on jumpscares"
ySy8mcceTno,They have to make a lost episode movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Which one do you think is better?
*Insidious 4: the last key* 
           Or 
*Slender Man (this version)*"
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like I’ve seen this type of movie before and they always end up being mediocre but we all deserve a chance🤷🏼‍♀️
ySy8mcceTno,YES! I CANT WAIT
ySy8mcceTno,"Um, ""Always Watching"", the FIRST Slenderman movie came out a pretty long while back... Kinda late on the Slenderman trend, don't you think?"
ySy8mcceTno,2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018 2018
ySy8mcceTno,It's been 87 years...
ySy8mcceTno,o por dios que shidori
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly I love the game, but this movie looks like it sucks. It doesn't even have an interesting plot, it's just a bunch of jumpscares. The only thing that's like the game is slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,2018 is gonna be the worst year ever
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,YAAAAAASSSS FINALLY!
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie should have like a daughter and dad out in the forest hiking and when it turns dark they go to sleep in their tent and the daughter wakes up because she needs to go and pee and the dad stays in the tent and fell back to sleep. After that the dad wakes up in the morning and noticed that her daughter never came back and when he went out looking for her he finds one of the 8 notes.. he keeps on searching but after awhile he sees slender man and tries to approach him and then the scene ends.. the next scene is police officers all around the forest and they have blocked all the ways to get inside the forest to do some research and the one who called the police and said that a family went missing was the dads brother when he found their hiking spot and that a note was there left by the dad and the daughter and dad had just disappeared. 

That would be a good start of the movie and i think the movie would be much better that way. But the movie hasn’t been released yet so I shouldn’t doubt it too early"
ySy8mcceTno,From a creepypasta/indie game to a Hollywood movie
ySy8mcceTno,Dudee I'm like super exited I hope they do Toby and Jeff next
ySy8mcceTno,happy to live in the city now
ySy8mcceTno,Yayaya
ySy8mcceTno,She didn’t grab the papers fast enough
ySy8mcceTno,This is the same company that made the emoji movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Smiley is better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there’s a scene where Logan Paul shows up in the woods. What a sinister twist.
ySy8mcceTno,Me dejó con un sabor de boca agridulce. No espero mucho de esta película pero probablemente no me vaya a dejar dormir algunos días después de ir a verla.
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or did this trailer feel long even tho it wasn't?
ySy8mcceTno,Meh!
ySy8mcceTno,Ésto podría superar a mi mamá y su chancla :0
ySy8mcceTno,this looks traaaash
ySy8mcceTno,Yo ya vi la película de SlenderMan el año pasado xD xD
ySy8mcceTno,Omg its so good
ySy8mcceTno,Well at least a movie a few years late
ySy8mcceTno,SE PRENDIÓ ESTÁ MIERDA Y SE PRENDIÓ DEMASIADO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😨😨😨😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman is dead
ySy8mcceTno,**Sips Tea.*
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Cometo Brazil!!! ...wait what?
ySy8mcceTno,Muito bom
ySy8mcceTno,"Too late now for a Slenderman movie, don't you think? I mean, Slender is not a thing anymore..."
ySy8mcceTno,Ohhh nooooo....
ySy8mcceTno,Uughhhhhhh. Hopefully slender man is shown more in the actual movie. Does look creepy tho
ySy8mcceTno,It's not even out and i already feel like it's gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Si es real podría valer una fortuna :v
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing that  this have in common with sleenderman is the name
ySy8mcceTno,My only question... Why?
ySy8mcceTno,Fake their not searching for notes.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wasn’t there already a slender man movie? 

Also why haven’t they made a five nights at freddys movie yet?"
ySy8mcceTno,Jfc no thank you
ySy8mcceTno,If you’re gonna make a slenderman movie atleast put slender man in it
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they do it right or the Creepypasta fans will rage ...and we dont want that
ySy8mcceTno,"Its late, but I'm still super excited and cannot wait to see it"
ySy8mcceTno,Who is looking also through the comments not watching the video?😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf, about 2% of this has to do with slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,Soy el único q habla español
ySy8mcceTno,woah that jumpscare almost gave me a heart attack 0:06
ySy8mcceTno,"Throwback to middle school. :') I'm glad there's finally a movie about this, definitely the best thing to ever come out of creepypasta. Such a fucking awesome concept and the character is so creepy. I'm excited."
ySy8mcceTno,Dang it's been 5 years wow lil old
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if Logan Paul will vlog it..
ySy8mcceTno,Yea i have wait this FOR YEARS
ySy8mcceTno,Why do i have a feeling slender will barley be in this
ySy8mcceTno,This is the last straw Sony if this isn’t good then this will be your 3rd trash movie in a row
ySy8mcceTno,Make a jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"If this is in Massachusetts, then I'm in Connecticut, witch means if a slenderman ever existed, I would be dead."
ySy8mcceTno,Ah está pasó tendremos a dear David :v
ySy8mcceTno,What is the plot?
ySy8mcceTno,O my god is thats the movie verry creppy slender yeahh
ySy8mcceTno,Well considering Slenderman is public domain if this movie sucks I'll probably just Kickstart a new one.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Yes yes yes
ySy8mcceTno,Generic horror movie #476
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this looks just plain stupid. Horror movies, are just so lame anymore. (However, I think it's because of my age now, also.)  As I get older nothing really scares me any longer. You older folks think the same or do things from movies like this still elicit fear from you?"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is terrible! ""Great job Sony for making a movie to remind kids he's real again."""
ySy8mcceTno,thought ita clickbait
ySy8mcceTno,será una buena película? :3
ySy8mcceTno,Por fin ya el verdadero tráiler de Slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yeah mehn. If this movie ends up being pg-13 (which it probably will) we bouta get some more bye bye man type cliched stuff boy.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not a fan of all these phycological horror movies that are being made tbh
ySy8mcceTno,"I would have preferred this to not be the 'steal children and full of jumpscares' slenderman but that looks like the direction it's going in.
Instead the Marble Hornet's Operator would have been a waaaaay better choice. The Operator infects people and forces them to do his bidding while also keeping them alive to spread the disease. It would have made for a more interesting movie, but I guess I'll see this when it comes out."
ySy8mcceTno,MarbleHornets did it better!
ySy8mcceTno,Since when did Slenderman get in your head? Whatever happened to eight pages in the woods?
ySy8mcceTno,Pfft. I bet slender is just trying to sell some bullets for $300 like dashie said.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this going to make it to real movie?
ySy8mcceTno,First in the Creepypasta multiverse
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so dumb
ySy8mcceTno,i feel like i just watched it
ySy8mcceTno,"Salió más eslenderman en ""mis peregrin"" que en este trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Well I just saw the whole movie in two minutes and thirty nine seconds.
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 Jonathan the gay elephant
ySy8mcceTno,Blair witch husband?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like crap 🤦🤔
ySy8mcceTno,AW COME ON!!! MAKE IT MORE CREEPY!!! ADD THE PROXIES!!
ySy8mcceTno,If you look closely you can see Slenderman at 1:17
ySy8mcceTno,"I legitimately never once got scared in this entire trailer. Hollywood needs to get back to the good old scary movie style, instead of relying on jumpscares and gross-outs to enforce a ""horror"" movie with a weak plot and weak scares."
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, my childhood fear come to life."
ySy8mcceTno,"I legitimately never once got scared in this entire trailer. Hollywood needs to get back to the good old scary movie style, instead of relying on jumpscares and gross-outs to enforce a ""horror"" movie with a weak plot and weak scares."
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Give him 20$ and he'll leave you alone bruh
ySy8mcceTno,They need to make jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,"‘SONY’




no thanks"
ySy8mcceTno,"Was this the trailer, or the whole movie??"
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait to see two girls stab a girl in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,Noooo!! You already ruined smurfs for me please don’t ruin Slenderman! 😢
ySy8mcceTno,Looks mediocre.
ySy8mcceTno,If you guys were to make a knock off stranger things demogorgon you couldve gotten noah schnapp for that one hospital scene he an expert at those scenes😐
ySy8mcceTno,Being gory =/= being scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Seriously?
ySy8mcceTno,O dear
ySy8mcceTno,Not surpries if sony makes more creepypasta movies like jeff the killer or eyeless jack or laughing jack
ySy8mcceTno,We better get a SCP movie after this
ySy8mcceTno,When I was 12 my cousin told me about slender man just to scare me and it actually did scare me. I'm 18 now and I can't wait to see this movie and sleep with my light on after I see it¡!
ySy8mcceTno,Yep must watch
ySy8mcceTno,This is nothing like the game
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta?
ySy8mcceTno,The Ring?
ySy8mcceTno,La quiero ver ya!!👌😱🙌
ySy8mcceTno,I only see 2 things about the original slender man: the forest and kids disappearing
ySy8mcceTno,⬇️⬇️⬇️
ySy8mcceTno,What's next': All people wanna be Pornstars
ySy8mcceTno,the Emoji movie 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"I really hope this isn't one of those ""it's actually just in their heads"" thing, cause I really hate those movies"
ySy8mcceTno,Esa película debe de estar buena no la deben de cagar
ySy8mcceTno,"Por dios, no la vallan a hacer para mayores de 18 porfavor"
ySy8mcceTno,wow hollywood has reqlly run out od ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"As a fan of horror movies, that wasn't as bad as people told me, looks might be ok"
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es verdad?
ySy8mcceTno,"I really hope this is good, Sony Pictures don't let us down!"
ySy8mcceTno,2 seconds of slender man showing and I'm already disappointed.
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if they'll make a cinematic universe with a spin-off Jeff the killer movie and a Ben drowned movie
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t slender man like a 2016 thing?
ySy8mcceTno,In a small town in Massachusetts. I live there but.....
ySy8mcceTno,Ha they used the baby laughing ringtone
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer doesn’t really tell us anything regarding the plot at all..... it’s just full of seemingly random imagery..... :/
ySy8mcceTno,I’m super hyped for this.
ySy8mcceTno,Se parece a el aro...
ySy8mcceTno,I think this movie will be a little more famous than IT
ySy8mcceTno,He growls. I haven't met him but in my years of following marble hornets and everyman hybrid I feel like it's safe to say that slenderman doesn't fucking growl.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man has some really cool lore behind it. It’s too bad they’re butchering the whole idea based on some fucking kids from Wisconsin who also misunderstood the character
ySy8mcceTno,Are you kidding me. Two teenagers tried to murder someone over slenderman and you're gonna make it a move now wow lol okay sure
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man??? Really
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully it's better than the last movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"May this point ""."" Reach 100.000 likes?"
ySy8mcceTno,*I waiting for that movie 1 year ;D finnaly i can watch it in cinema bu must wait :(*
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Cliche? Yes. Bad? Not necessarily.
ySy8mcceTno,"*_ENGLISH_*
If it's real, I just hope you know how to stick to reality without making a film of bad special effects, bad plot, and completely fantasizing, a film of poor quality go.
I say it because the trailer half convinced me, but that's why nobody dares to make this film, it takes a very good director and budget, it will be quite complicated to take ""Slender Man"" to the big screen, because it is something ""absurd"", for example, recently ""League of Justice"" has come out and obviously bringing a lot of aliens, gods, superhumans, etc., is not an easy task, however, although it was not the best movie in history, it was not Not bad for as there were expectations from many critics.
I hope this does not leave much to be desired.

*_ESPAÑOL_*
Si es real, solo espero que sepan como apegarlo a la realidad sin hacer una película de malos efectos especiales, mala trama, y completamente fantasiosa, una película de mala calidad vaya.
Lo digo porque el tráiler me medio convenció, pero por eso nadie se atreve a hacer esta pelicula, se necesita un muy buen director y presupuesto, sera bastante complicado llevar a ""Slender Man"" a la pantalla grande, pues es algo ""absurdo"", por ejemplo, recientemente ha salido ""League of Justice"" y obviamente llevar un montón de alienigenas, dioses, superhumanos, etc, no es una tarea nada facil, sin embargo, pese a que no haya sido la mejor película de la historia, no estuvo nada mal para como había expectativas de parte de muchos criticos.
Ojalá esta no deje mucho que desear."
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmmm... Finally childhood slenderman is a movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok but what if Slender Man is Jack from the Nightmare before Christmas, did anyone think about that?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ffs it’s about time they make a movie about slender
ySy8mcceTno,Sony been making some shitty movie decisions....emoji movie now this...slender man has been irrelevant for so long now
ySy8mcceTno,Para que hacer una película de un personaje ya olvidado?
ySy8mcceTno,Nossa que bosta
ySy8mcceTno,"this is like 5 years late since slenderman was popular, especially when i get over creepypastas now they make a slenderman movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"There's evidence of a poor decision by the director even in the trailer. the scene at 1:38 should have been a quick pan, showing him a long distance away and advancing slowly, obscuring and then another quick pan showing him immedietly next to the tree. Instead there is a lower effort cut to jump scare. Absolutely horrible quality even in the trailer. Expect a sub-par C+ movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Nigga just press z and erase him
ySy8mcceTno,"""How do you do, fellow kids?"""
ySy8mcceTno,I hope im wrong but it just seems like the typical horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,We need a creepypasta universe...
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve waited for this since 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"2009 está llamando, dice que quiere su Creepypasta de vuelta."
ySy8mcceTno,The slender man hype is dead ever since the actual legit murder of a child! There has been a strong decline of the video games and yet they still decide to make yet another slender man movie. Nice... Nice...
ySy8mcceTno,And it only took 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,Taking bets on how terrible this will be compared to the Marble Hornets stuff
ySy8mcceTno,"Man I sure do miss old Youtube, back when people didn't ruin CreepyPasta welp those good days won't ever come back ;(.
_sees Slender Trailer_ 
OH DEAR GOD
FINALLY YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
ySy8mcceTno,"This just seems like a bad version of the ring

ySy8mcceTno,"well, this is a win for the internet... They finally made a movie from a creepy pasta"
ySy8mcceTno,CADÊ OS BR COMENTANDO TAMBEM KKKK
ySy8mcceTno,its a dead meme cmon
ySy8mcceTno,OMG it was pewdiepie all along😨
ySy8mcceTno,Recreation of It
ySy8mcceTno,Now we are gonna wait for Jeff the Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,My god I can't wait 😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,This has nothing to do with the actual slender
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 you can actually hear the gay elephant noise! :P
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,"Mate this movie is 8 years too late,  this is cringy."
ySy8mcceTno,It better be better then *Always Watching*
ySy8mcceTno,Only about 4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Not really trending anymore but ok
ySy8mcceTno,The new IT
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my god this looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony don’t mess this up
ySy8mcceTno,What is the slenderman? I've heard of it but Idk wtf it is
ySy8mcceTno,WTF is this video
ySy8mcceTno,sony has a bad marketing team
ySy8mcceTno,Better make up for the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,CİNEMAXİMUM
ySy8mcceTno,Well...this looks terrible. Slenderman isn't even a relevant thing anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,"#Everymanhybrid, #Marblehornets, #tribetwelve
Hollywood is once again cooked by...kids from the internet!"
ySy8mcceTno,TURKİSH FİLM SLENDER MAN
ySy8mcceTno,Uu:-) yeee
ySy8mcceTno,Direct to DVD pls.
ySy8mcceTno,PUTAAAAA!!!! Al fin una película de un creepypasta chingon!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Cover me

ySy8mcceTno,Movie based on dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,oh now they're making a movie out of it? i swear i still cant sleep with the light off cause of him
ySy8mcceTno,thank god no bad cgi can't wait looks dope and scary
ySy8mcceTno,I would be excited for this but it’s by the people who made the emoji movie so can’t really get your expectations to high
ySy8mcceTno,First of All  Why is This just Now Getting a movie This Should Have Gotten a Movie  When it was Still Popular  Second of all Where is He At Is He Going to be Like Godzilla  in the New 2016 Movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I am rather disappointed that they did not show Slenderman at all the entire trailer. All it was was gross images. That is not Slenderman. The scariest part of Slenderman IS SLENDERMAN!!! I mean look at the end card. That is really cool looking. And I fangasmed when the clip of Slenderman drawings on the wall. But hay, maybe it will be really good even with the lack of Slenderman. I just hope they try to have it be a little different from the generic horror movies. And not just fill it with jumpscares.

*Edit: I just realized it is Sony making the movie. So it will probably suck."
ySy8mcceTno,Let's just hope they don't screw up such an iconic character.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this going to theaters?
ySy8mcceTno,IT part two??
ySy8mcceTno,I was kinda hoping for a found footage film in the vain of stuff like MarbleHornets and TribeTwelve.
ySy8mcceTno,Sonda Slendermanı Yiğit abi öldürüyor.
ySy8mcceTno,*F L O P*
ySy8mcceTno,*would be better if it was based off slender the arrival or marble hornets*
ySy8mcceTno,... the death of creepypastas is near.
ySy8mcceTno,Por fin
ySy8mcceTno,Seeing this asap
ySy8mcceTno,what about slendetubbies
ySy8mcceTno,This actually just looks like one of those fake trailers people put together using footage from different movies.  Why Sony. Why.
ySy8mcceTno,Ya era hora de hacer esta pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,You're 5 years too late Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,"I just came here to listen a gay elephant noise, I´m not dissapointed at all"
ySy8mcceTno,It better be good cause I'm getting tired of everyone making jokes out of Cp XD also the fan fics are meh. needs to die. All i can say is. it better be scary.
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s a joke, please tell me it’s a joke"
ySy8mcceTno,Lamest capitalization on a trend since The Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,The emjoy movie was scarier
ySy8mcceTno,The games are better than this  mediocre trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I'm getting the feeling that the Marble Hornets movie did it better. But from the trailer I can tell how this will go.
ySy8mcceTno,What's next Jeff the killer?!
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if the original slender man’s creator is making bank on this.
ySy8mcceTno,Yo quero la de jeff the killir
ySy8mcceTno,Nah That's not my humor.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god. JUST LEAVE JUST RUN AND NEVER LOOK BACK CHILD.
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG YASSS FINALLY IM SO HAPPY! THANK YOU TO WHO EVER HAD THIS IDEA!!!! I HOPE THAT GIRL IS SALLY! I LOVIT ALREADY!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Sorry I’m just SOOOO EXCITED “ This film is not yet rated” I haven’t seen it yet but I already give it 1,000,000,000/100"

ySy8mcceTno,I wonder when the people who own the rights to slenderman are gonna shut this down like the last 2 movies
ySy8mcceTno,Pause it at around 1:50 and 2:14 to actually see some of Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,MAYBE AT THE END a guy can be in the woods and and find a page so it can be like the game.
ySy8mcceTno,already 11 dislikes
ySy8mcceTno,So far it’s an eh. Not too excited for it but I’ll give it a shot

ySy8mcceTno,We see the ending in this trailer just fyi
ySy8mcceTno,*Slender Ball : Evolution*
ySy8mcceTno,This first for seconds tho... 0:00-0:04
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul’s video of the suicide forest should be here...
ySy8mcceTno,So want to watch that!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I’m confused
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer should be next!
ySy8mcceTno,Skip
ySy8mcceTno,This movies probably gonna be really bad. Im going to be honest I want this movie to be really good cause Slenderman is like my favourite Creepypasta but movies that are on video games usually don't do good. I really do want this movie to do amazing and I hope this movie will break the cycle of bad video game movies. I mean this movie might be able to break the cycle of really bad video game movies because Slenderman as a character and in video games doesn't really have much source material so the job of respecting source material should be easy if you get the basics of Slenderman right. I feel like the source material part and respecting it might be the easy part of making this movie even though thats a part where alot's of writers fail at when it comes to video game movies but Slenderman is pretty basic so this something the writers of this movie shouldn't fail at. I feel like if your going to make a video game movie you should respect the source material but also don't rely on it too much and get a little creative yourself and Slenderman is the perfect character for that. But my main concern isn't just source material but how will this do as a movie like will it be scary? will it be good? will it be a movie that isn't only made for video game fans of the franchise? Or will this movie just be a gigantic insult to everybody including fans of the series and people who just like movies in general? Will this movie prove that video game movies can be good? Will this movie be smart? Or boring? Or will this movie be alot better than everybody expects to be?
ySy8mcceTno,"Llegaste tarde Sony, 5 años tarde >:'v"
ySy8mcceTno,This got to be good
ySy8mcceTno,*This would have been really good if it was based off the game slender: the arrival. Look it up yourself!*
ySy8mcceTno,eh
ySy8mcceTno,Who would of thought a slender man movie would kill me.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna suck like most modern horror films
ySy8mcceTno,This is caca
ySy8mcceTno,Still gonna watch it for the nostalgia
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh god, I know i don't want to watch this, but I just have to don't I?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Soiler Alert:
Logan Paul find slenderman in the forest"
ySy8mcceTno,Umm never knew this would happen and wow

ySy8mcceTno,Remember someone almost got killed for this rumor?
ySy8mcceTno,Is that Kevin durant
ySy8mcceTno,They're actually making this movie wow
ySy8mcceTno,"seems like they're going for a more creepy and thrill type of film and it also seems to want to play with the viewers head, so hopefully if they succeed and don't go the typical jump scare after jump scare path, the film could be disturbing in a good way"

ySy8mcceTno,Y E S

ySy8mcceTno,¡Genial! * 3 *
ySy8mcceTno,"Replay the video and read the following to the music:

One day, a girl by 16 named Emily hits the road to her home from school. Unplanned additional courses being the reason, she leaves at 7 p.m, 2 hours later than usual. Since she lives in a town only about 3 miles from the city centre, she walks to the public  bus stop. As usual, she takes the 10-minute-walk road that goes through the ******* Forest to the bus stop. The weather is gloomy, and no one else walks on the road. A little frightened, she picks up the pace so as to shorten the time she walks in the forest, in which she feels a spooky sense that she has never ever felt. En route to the bus stop, she hears a whistle from far away. Surprised on one hand, she thinks on her own how come can she hear a whistle from that far - doesn't even want to think of its source - frightened on the other hand, she feels the heat in her body, and the sweat droplets gliding from her hair bulbs down her forehead. Suddenly, she starts to run as if the satan himself were chasing her. To top it off, she hears loud growls. They sound as if the roots of trees are being removed. Fortunately, now the bus stop is in her sight. She arrives, and so does the bus. She sits a seat, and reconsiders what she just experienced back there. She still shakes with fear. On arriving her stop, she gets off the bus and heads her home. She knocks the door, only to find out that there is nobody home. In the depths of despair, she walks into the home, opening its door with keys. Just when she needs her loved ones with her, she is left alone. Then her fear comes true: she hears rattles up on the second floor. Wishing it all to be a dream, she enters the bathroom, and washes her sweaty face. As she becomes aware of an ordinary shadow behind her, she looks at the mirror with hesitation. He is there. She sees the reflection of Him. A grinning black face with large eyes dark as a starless night which tell much more than what words can say. To His waist lies His hair even darker than His eyes. An hour later, the poor young girl's parents come home. When her dad wants to take a bath, he sees blood enough to take a blood bath instead. He gives way at the knees screaming. Down from the ceiling is Emily's head hung. He - not knowing what to do - seraches for her dead body. But it was nowhere to be found. At that particular moment, he hears his wife's poignant scream. Desperate as if lost in an endless maze, he awaits his death, as terror caresses his soul gently as if nothing bad is going to happen. From that night onwards, the population of the town has decreased, either because of Him, or because of people's desire to not die. Just to make things worse, He cannot be traced, nor can He be seen by people other than His victims. The whole town is left to its destiny, maybe the whole country, or maybe even the whole world. Who knows?

Not bad for the first horror story I've written."
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY FUKING GOOD
ySy8mcceTno,A SLENDER MAN MOVIE!??!?!?! awesome
ySy8mcceTno,Oh this reminds me of the girl that murdered people for slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY GOD!!!!!! SO WANNA GO SEE THIS!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Too fucking late....Way to late.This is probably going to be bad, it's probably just going to be ""Oh no a jumpscare uhhhh"""
ySy8mcceTno,"I can see this being another cliche horror movie but since it's Slender Man, I'm gonna give it a watch"
ySy8mcceTno,Irrelevant
ySy8mcceTno,Another forest video will slender man be blogging the kid’s hanging body
ySy8mcceTno,"So many people are hating. Give it a chance, I'm going to watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,México?
ySy8mcceTno,YESSS WAITED FOR THIS SINCE 2012
ySy8mcceTno,did i just watch the trailer to the cassette from the Ring???
ySy8mcceTno,its going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,2018 - The Paul Brothers
ySy8mcceTno,"In my opinion, the longer they waited, the higher expectations have gotten, so it better be good."
ySy8mcceTno,"By the way
""People don't just... disappear"" 
GENIUS"
ySy8mcceTno,"We got Slender, a new Michael Myers movie this year looks promising"
ySy8mcceTno,Well you had a chance to do something creative and finally bring back the monster films but sadly you are pulling out a check list instead of taking a risk
ySy8mcceTno,AWESOME
ySy8mcceTno,That's pretty scary 😨
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like a pretty good movie not gonna lie but there missing too many things like the way he looks and the way he does stuff to you. Plus they should’ve realeased this like 7-8 years ago when people still knew about him and remembered stuff
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t we just let a good horror trend die?
ySy8mcceTno,NOT INTERESTED AT ALL!
ySy8mcceTno,Who got reminded of stranger things??
ySy8mcceTno,🤦🏽‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,If you go a bit deeper into the forest you can see Logan Paul staring at a dead body hanging
ySy8mcceTno,"Please Sony, if you're gonna make this bad, at least make it amazingly bad, just to make it memorable"
ySy8mcceTno,ohhhh yeah boi cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,You're a little late sony.
ySy8mcceTno,HA!! Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,whats next jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Isso vai ser awosome '-'
ySy8mcceTno,But it's seems to be about... nothing?
ySy8mcceTno,U can't be serious....
ySy8mcceTno,Sony chill 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Please be good
ySy8mcceTno,Did Sony rip off of RedLetterMedia?
ySy8mcceTno,Can I put it at 20 dollars mode?
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve seen dog food scarier than this movie trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Blair witch project > All horror movies
ySy8mcceTno,"wow this looks terrible. Surprised it took this long for someone to do a slender man movie xD I remember waiting for clips of Marbel Hornets to come out years ago, time goes by so fast"
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t care if I scream my head off this looks good!
ySy8mcceTno,Gotta show this to Markiplier!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like garbageeee
ySy8mcceTno,"uuuuuugh this is honestly terrible

I swear sony only makes movies for money"
ySy8mcceTno,My god this gives me the chiles CANT WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE AYYYYYYY #brittyy44 LOVE YOU BRITTYY!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Should have came out 8 years ago with nick cage as slender man
ySy8mcceTno,tbh it dosent look that bad unlike the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie by Sony, Jeff the Killer: the Musical"
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't think they got it
Hope I'm wrong"
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm I don't know about this. But I will give it a chance🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Deus é pai
ySy8mcceTno,A Little late
ySy8mcceTno,Ola yo soy fan de jeff the killer y de eslenderman  los quiero mucho
ySy8mcceTno,I puased and scrolled down at 1 second in
ySy8mcceTno,Creó q no tiene nada que ver con slenderman no aparece el o que?
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres slendy?
ySy8mcceTno,I bet this will just be forgettableNot bad but not memorable or acceptable
ySy8mcceTno,I need a girlfriend my Facebook Emilio Caro
ySy8mcceTno,Looks very mediocre. Usually trailers make movies seem scarier than they actually are. But for this movie expectations are set low by this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"If anyone wants some info on the movie, here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender_Man_(film)"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 5 years late....
ySy8mcceTno,As Sony want to milk as much money from us when is the PS4 only console exclusive slender man game releasing?
ySy8mcceTno,What other internet fads of 2013 will be made into a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy i can't wait for a logan paul cameo
ySy8mcceTno,"The alternate title of this movie should have been 'Bye Bye Man 2: The Cancer lives on' because from the looks of the trailer, it's going to be generic as every 2010s horror movie. From the spastic cuts, jumpscares, and desperate attempts to express a character's insanity in the film, I have no high hopes at all for the 'Slender Man'. Hell, the horror genre itself is just a copy and paste of the same scenarios over and over again; and I can't believe people are gullible to watch/pay for this cinematic trash. But over all, the most abhorrent notion is that Sony is making this film with barely any thought or effort of the original source material- this is probably a more lazy cash grab than the Emoji Movie and Ghostbusters(2016) combined. At this point the people behind this project are just throwing darts at a cork board filled with 'trendy' internet things that people like that are basically fad now. I used to be one of those fan boys that obsessed over creepypastas, and at times a I still am when watching ARGs, but when poorly adapted garbage like this comes out I just shake my head and forget it ever existed."
ySy8mcceTno,cool looks good
ySy8mcceTno,I was actually looking to see if they put the little notes but they didnt
ySy8mcceTno,I am so okay with this...
ySy8mcceTno,Girl I was runningggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
ySy8mcceTno,First of alllllllll why you doing in the forest?
ySy8mcceTno,The appeal of Slenderman is Slenderman himself. This looks more like the grudge + bye bye man + some other paranormal bs. Where TF is slendy? We liked him for the way he stalked his victims and got closer and closer. What happened to that.
ySy8mcceTno,```Yes```
ySy8mcceTno,Si alguien sabe me puede decir cuando se estrena
ySy8mcceTno,Wow why slender man movie in 2018 while creepy pastas community is dead in 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Omg yess finally my dreams come true :D
ySy8mcceTno,"Way to capitalize. Finally, might I add. I hope you do it justice. Bearable movies are getting slim these days."
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this is the real deal
ySy8mcceTno,It's late 10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,great now im scared to be alone
ySy8mcceTno,I think a Slender Man movie was made so late because even though it’s based on the CreepyPasta I think the movie might have been inspired by the case a few years back with the two girls stabbing their friend because they were trying to prove themselves to Slender Man. Something like that I don’t remember all the specifics but I think that’s what caused more buzz around Slender Man. It’s still kinda late though but the trailer seems interesting.
ySy8mcceTno,Some kids are gonna get the idea that he’s real and do a sacrifice again like when those 2 girls stabbed her friend 19 times
ySy8mcceTno,Why could we have not seen what he looks like at least that was the only reason I watched the trailer was to see what they made him look like
ySy8mcceTno,Does this guy really lead teenagers to commit crimes?
ySy8mcceTno,Definitely looks creepy with the black and white and stuff. But we didn’t really see slender man in the trailer. Dontcha wanna see like his actual body and see how they designed the holy lord slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Thay grey filter got me spooked.
ySy8mcceTno,"I wanted to see the slender man
( ; _ ; )"
ySy8mcceTno,So far it looking bad :/
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't slender take lost children not kill plz someone help me
ySy8mcceTno,Smh a little late but I’m willing to give it a chance. Don’t make me regret it Sony 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
ySy8mcceTno,Can't believe they actually fucking did it
ySy8mcceTno,garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Si esto es verdad debe valer una fortuna :v
ySy8mcceTno,Y la de dear David cuando apa?
ySy8mcceTno,The.minecraft movie is coming on 2019
ySy8mcceTno,I'm twelve......TWELVE AND I AM NOT EVEN SCARED.......
ySy8mcceTno,Wait was that a connection to the 2 girls who stabbed one of their friends and left them in the forest to discover slender?
ySy8mcceTno,I is this real
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you're a little bit too late or should I say your hell of fucking too late it's not about Slenderman anymore it's all about that natural disaster nevermind that was so last year it's all about Logan Paul finding a dead person in Japan suicide forest and using their body in the thumbnail for clickbait to get more views.😂😂✊ who knows they might bring school shootings back but that's really boring
ySy8mcceTno,"First statement of trailer is stupid.  ""people don't just disappear"".  Uh, yeah they do.  Thousands a year just dissapear."
ySy8mcceTno,"Esta echo por Sony, el personaje esta en buenas manos :v"
ySy8mcceTno,"Who talks about slenderman anymore?, he died years ago."
ySy8mcceTno,A video game/creepypasta is coming true! :3
ySy8mcceTno,"I've never liked Slender Man, but Marble Hornets is 10x better than what this is going to be, and you don't have to pay $15 to watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,Selten so einen langweiligen Trailer gesehen!!
ySy8mcceTno,one of the girls stabbed her self in the head and the blood got on one of the kids.......I hope that kid who has blood on her didn't go to jail for life.
ySy8mcceTno,It it only me or others.. i thought title was written spider man 😭
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it's trying way too hard.
ySy8mcceTno,Its ok ...
ySy8mcceTno,So bored !!!
ySy8mcceTno,Goat
ySy8mcceTno,"You're late
*15 years too late*"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh and #CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Dead meme.
ySy8mcceTno,what
ySy8mcceTno,YES THERES SLENDER MAN AND THEN THE TURNING WITH MY FAVORITE PERSON FINN WOLFHARD two scary movies woohoo
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the whole thing was that he just stood and watched from the shadows and children went with him willingly. This seems just like another cliché monster movie
ySy8mcceTno,#SlenderMan
ySy8mcceTno,"Ugh....... ok, this looks pretty scary"
ySy8mcceTno,Scary
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,This is creepy I want to watch it but at the same time I dont
ySy8mcceTno,*-That's awesome but scary at the same time-*
ySy8mcceTno,I'm hyped.
ySy8mcceTno,About a decade late...
ySy8mcceTno,I’m guessing five nights at Freddy’s next
ySy8mcceTno,I want Dan to see this because he hates Slender man thanks to the game lol
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Doesen't seem to bad than i was expecting
ySy8mcceTno,HOLY SUGAR HONEY ICE TEA(!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,OMGOMGOMGOMG OHHHHH SLENDER IN THE HOUSE! # SLENDER MAN THE MOVE <3
ySy8mcceTno,I like the movie trailer but I wish they made this back in 2012 when slender was popular
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer seems pretty lame
ySy8mcceTno,what's slender man again ?
ySy8mcceTno,Si te aburre el tráiler imagínate la película
ySy8mcceTno,cagata gigantesca
ySy8mcceTno,*The first official creepypasta movie* :3
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if they end up finding all 8 notes...
ySy8mcceTno,"Boring..looks like ripping of nightmare on elm street a bit...oh i forgot its hollywood, no original ideas."
ySy8mcceTno,5 years of delay
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait! My friend told me to watch this because we both love creppypasta and I got to say this will be the best horror movie I watch
ySy8mcceTno,7 YEARS LATE
ySy8mcceTno,I think they had  their calender off by 5 years...because slenderman is outdated
ySy8mcceTno,Cool i hope it's a good one
ySy8mcceTno,Good...Now Five Night at Freddy's?
ySy8mcceTno,This is the new high school musical?
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os Br?
ySy8mcceTno,Many are defending this movie saying it could be some phycological horror but its based on a creepy pasta and video game my guess is that this will be a movie on the level of the Bye Bye Man with the illusion of horror but really nothing substantial just jumpscares and images of gross stuff like maggots
ySy8mcceTno,Quem veio pelo Antônio boco
ySy8mcceTno,They are talking about not playing it in Wisconsin. SONY will you send it to Netflix like you did with The Interview?
ySy8mcceTno,All the Slender Man games and now Slender Man (2018) Movie......make #1TRENDING #CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Algum br ? Querendo assistir tbm
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't two little girls kill their classmate for Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,<3
ySy8mcceTno,Chairo wey
ySy8mcceTno,"Horror fans and especially creepypasta fans should not be calling this ""too late."" Why reject the chance to make a movie about one of the most iconic modern fairytales just because all the tweens and normies have moved on?"
ySy8mcceTno,He regresado al 2012 ❤
ySy8mcceTno,Placing my bet on this just being a medicore jumpscare fest.
ySy8mcceTno,"Eh, que asco, slenderman en la ""historia"" del creepypasta el no le hacía nada a los niños solo se los llevaba en todo caso, la temática de la película tendría que ser de niños desaparecidos y las personas buscándolos no de terror como se muestra en el trailer, mas bien suspenso, drama y misterio. Slenderman no le hacía daño a los niños solo se los llevaba, y se que también los mataba o acosaba pero, una temática así seria mejor que los típicos sustos para nada bien echos..."
ySy8mcceTno,So this is going to be a bad version of Te Witch?
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone know when this movie is coming out?
ySy8mcceTno,After so many years it’s finally here
ySy8mcceTno,Swap the audio with the resident evil 7 theme. That would make the trailer better.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol this movie doesnt  look scary
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul knows where his child is. Out in the woods dead
ySy8mcceTno,Dosen't look that creepy tbh
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, I can tell this won't be good. Another name being raped"
ySy8mcceTno,We all know that a movie of Slender Man was inevitable. Now that it's here.. let me just say it looks freakin' awesome!
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be the best movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,It’s going to be another emoji movie😂
ySy8mcceTno,dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Took them long enough
ySy8mcceTno,This had almost nothing to do with the source material
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the emoji movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Tantos años viviendo para este momento 
Valio la pena 7-7"
ySy8mcceTno,this is just press for timberlake's new album
ySy8mcceTno,jajajajajaja
ySy8mcceTno,"I dislike this trailer because the amount of people in this movie is unreal, in every official slender game, *You. Are. Alone.* no one can save you and as you follow a trail of incresingly disturbing notes and locations and disturbing visions, slender man gets aggressive and haunts you even more and he become relentless and eventually you die. This movie looks like someone heard of slender man did no research and made a generic horror movie with little to no ties to the actual cannon of the slender man series. Its looks like a cash grab and these directors that try to make something from games or anime seem to always fail because they ignore what made them popular or attractive."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this really coming to move theater I hope if it is I'm going
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDYYY
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not sleeping for a month
ySy8mcceTno,a few years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Ambuplay vai à loucura
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,about 7 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Lol always knew they would make a movie about it...
ySy8mcceTno,I am terrified.
ySy8mcceTno,The fan-made short film is a million times better than this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Better late then never right guys?
ySy8mcceTno,WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO BRING SLENDERMAN BACK I THOUGHT I CLOSED THIS AWFUL CRINGEY CHAPTER OF MY LIFE GODDAMNIT
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,At least use stuff from the original Urban Legend lol
ySy8mcceTno,But the problem with the movie is that it's based on a video game and we all know how those turned out
ySy8mcceTno,This is pretty much the entire movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Looks so generic
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like this trailer doesn't exactly have full potential/full effort put into it. It seems fan made, as well as some things shown aren't exactly relevant to the orginal slender man origin/story. It also seems cliche, but let's hope the full movie will have alot of effort put in and will actually be interesting."
ySy8mcceTno,wish i was old enough...
ySy8mcceTno,Les falto la estática al final xd :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Llama 2009
Pide que les regrese sus Creepypastas xdxdxd"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is coming out like 7 years later lol
ySy8mcceTno,1:21😂😂😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,This sadly doesnt look good
ySy8mcceTno,WTF???? Hey What is this? A reboot of THE RING? :v
ySy8mcceTno,"It 2018, is slender man still popular?"
ySy8mcceTno,Their like 4 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,The most cliché filled trailer I’ve ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,afTER ALL THIS TIME
ySy8mcceTno,"I LOVE Marble Hornets, but this looks... a little disappointing?"
ySy8mcceTno,Do we get a fnaf movie now lol
ySy8mcceTno,Where the Lyosacks at?
ySy8mcceTno,Dafuq I thought Slender was my friend.
ySy8mcceTno,"They finally are doing it, and only 7 years late. Will it be good? Meh idk, I'll watch a review."
ySy8mcceTno,Best horror movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Movimiento naranja Movimiento ciudadano NANANANA NANA NANANA NANA.
ySy8mcceTno,no way
ySy8mcceTno,"Cliche, but a new topic of what scares"
ySy8mcceTno,This was the longest 2:39 min of my life 😰I need a vacation 💀😂
ySy8mcceTno,Lick boob
ySy8mcceTno,movie legit looks terriable
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really bad but I guess I'll have to wait to see it
ySy8mcceTno,"*This character hasn't been popular in YEARS, you're really late*"
ySy8mcceTno,STOP WITH THE SUCIDE
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh i thought it was a fanmade trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Wow heartless money grabbing souls over at Sony. This film glorifies a very real crime that occurred a few years back at that is disturbing in itself
ySy8mcceTno,Are for mons tap red. Is blues rsrsrars taps likes ok
ySy8mcceTno,This looks promising and terrible at the same time
ySy8mcceTno,Boooooring
ySy8mcceTno,"Yess!! From Photoshop competiton to a game to a movie, this sure has evolved."
ySy8mcceTno,It took so long for this movie xD
ySy8mcceTno,Where's slender? Jk I saw him
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for a movie like this ever singe i was a kid and was a fan of the slender game and all the creepypastas!
ySy8mcceTno,It looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't even tell what this movie is supposed to be about apart from Slenderman, some bugs, and a missing girl. If the trailer is this bad, forget about watching the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Meh this is so 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,the new slendergame looks good
ySy8mcceTno,1.52 jump scare yeah you know it
ySy8mcceTno,"Come on Sony, the emoji movie was scary enough."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is old
ySy8mcceTno,This is acaully based on a real story. Crazy right?
ySy8mcceTno,"Most anticipated movie of 2010





Oh wait wrong year"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony....
ySy8mcceTno,Oppa ganganam style
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone tell me what this is gonna be about and not say it's about Slenderman kidnapping people and the cops are giving up searching for them
ySy8mcceTno,America was founded on genocide and lies
ySy8mcceTno,"Do I need to have like 200 IQ to understand what is going on in this trailer? 
Sorry to say that but creepypasta seems to be scarier than this...."
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman looks more like venom than the actually slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,reminds me of first time I did shrooms
ySy8mcceTno,No matter how good this movie is mad people are going to watch it
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 What kind of sound is that? A gay elephant?
ySy8mcceTno,no way. FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,I CAN'T WAIT *OMG*
ySy8mcceTno,"Well. Its about.Freaking.TIME. took em what 8 years 11? This is going to freaking scary as ""It"" for the first time"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait at 1:39 there is nothing on the left but then when she sees him and hides again it looks like he is standing right next to her 😨😱. I may be late af but still, I never noticed that lol."
ySy8mcceTno,The best on the movie is slenderman and he only apear 5 seconds in the trailer!!
ySy8mcceTno,It’s sad that an urban legend has been demoted to a creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,"Remember that teen girl who took her friend out in the woods and stabbed her a bunch of times in the name of ""slender Man"". I'd rather see her react to the trailer than see the movie lol."
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully it ends up being better than in the trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,But where tf was slender?!
ySy8mcceTno,"I""M MORE SCARED OF OUR PRESIDENT"
ySy8mcceTno,"... this is supposed to be slender? Is that a joke? Isolation and fear without actually dying and NOT seeing what's happened to hurt the people around you is the entire point. The girl stabbing herself in class? Is that a freaking joke?

Zero confidence they even understood the basic story elements when writing this."
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY AFTER 1 BILLION YEARS!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Bit late but i still got chills
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear Sony... If you only get two things right this year, let it be Into the Spidey Verse and Venom, if this must suffer for the success of those two let it happen."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Logan Paul stars in this movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"If Sony fucks this up I’m gonna flip because I know lots about slender man, it used to be a part of my preteen edgy life"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this already old?
ySy8mcceTno,what does this have to do with slender man i’m very confused
ySy8mcceTno,"Can't wait for jeff the killer in 2025, sony"
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie after this one: Jeff the killer or smile dog
ySy8mcceTno,Running out of ideas after emoji movie? Lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Yes I really hope this is good
ySy8mcceTno,This actually grabbed my interest. Looks pretty good
ySy8mcceTno,Logan paul finds a *dead person in the suicide forest*  slenderman is made live action by the same company that made the emoji movie........I love 2018 already......
ySy8mcceTno,aight look all you gotta do is find the eight pages and it should all go back to normal k?
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, i really thought that the trailer was too cliche and we all know slenderman ""face"" very well, so i guess it'd be more scary to actually show him close to some one than show him in shadows, cause it didn't feel so scary. Back in game, it was scary to see it close to you as if it was reaching, i hope he don't appears all the time like he did in the trailer, all black. I think the white in his face is one of the most scary things.
Now something that would be very awesome is an owlman movie (from the owlman prank)"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man Was Extremely Popular In 2012 Yet Sony Is Just Now Making A Slender Man Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Alfin compañeros llegó el dia

ySy8mcceTno,Ok

ySy8mcceTno,Disssappointeddddd  !!!
ySy8mcceTno,AHHHHHHHH
ySy8mcceTno,a tad bit late to jump on the slenderman band wagon...
ySy8mcceTno,I actually don't hate this.
ySy8mcceTno,Okay please make some creepypasta movies like jeff the killer laughing jack and others please

Me when I find out it's time to wake up for school."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow amazig ❤️
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que no hagan algo como la Death Note
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like they going to pull a Godzilla and show slenderman less
ySy8mcceTno,ok but why Sony? ok but why would you get a director and a writer who havent done anything good in their career?
ySy8mcceTno,Warnig
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm excited, but where was this movie 5 years ago?"
ySy8mcceTno,Amazing \(^_^)/
ySy8mcceTno,You have one chance dont ruin it
ySy8mcceTno,Looking forward to it
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting for this for literally years and I'm not gunna lie....I hope it's better than the trailer because I wasn't impressed
ySy8mcceTno,Sony hasn't had the best rep recently with movies we'll see what happens with this one
ySy8mcceTno,Fnaf And Now This . its Goig To Be A Good Year
ySy8mcceTno,I'm definitely going to see this I'm not scared of it
ySy8mcceTno,And only 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"First the fanfics now this leave slender alone

#slendurrawareness"
ySy8mcceTno,I used to be deathly scared of this motherfucker in 6th grade.
ySy8mcceTno,please leave slenderman in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real or fake?
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Who came here because of the gay elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this about the slenderman stabbing case?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony sucks at keeping up with trends, bet in 2023 we’ll get a movie about Logan Paul finding a dead body in the suicide forest"
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer was all over the place
ySy8mcceTno,Parece ser que a slender man le han dado nuevos power ops sacados del culo
ySy8mcceTno,Who else wants to see this but knows that their mom won't let them. 😭
ySy8mcceTno,Si la huvieran sacado cuando estaba mas de moda en el 2012 por hay exito asegurado pero ahora esto es como meh
ySy8mcceTno,Cool :V
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks decent, Either way i'm seeing it for the sake of 13 year old me who loved horror. Too bad it wasn't made 4 years ago, would have gotten my whole group of friends to go. I remember when the slender game came out on ps3 my friends and I stayed up till 5 am lights off taking turns with my turtle beaches full volume. Ah, good memories"
ySy8mcceTno,"...I feel like I should be expecting a call any second now from someone telling me that I’m going to die in 7 days.
That’s how I feel after watching this."
ySy8mcceTno,10k virgin nerds disliked this vid.
ySy8mcceTno,It’s ok trailer
ySy8mcceTno,They’re going to ruin 2011’s greatest original idea
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like the movie might be based on the girl that killed her friend that was a fan of Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,Alguien habla español?
ySy8mcceTno,How many creepypasta and marble hornet fans will be made if this doesn't match his cannon and lore XD
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t think we need this movie
ySy8mcceTno,like yes do you like a movie of jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,6 Years lays aren’t you Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,im not scared im scared of mickymouse
ySy8mcceTno,In which my emotional response to this is:      <_<
ySy8mcceTno,Esta feo el tráiler
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing like the game
ySy8mcceTno,kray.. bem loko
ySy8mcceTno,"There's a case where two girls stabbed their friend in the woods as an offering to ""Slenderman""."
ySy8mcceTno,"Stand name: Slender man
Stand user: Little girl"
ySy8mcceTno,*why?*
ySy8mcceTno,I'm down NOT to watch. You?
ySy8mcceTno,Fucking FINNALLY!!!
ySy8mcceTno,ROOM is better than this
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next jeff the killer 😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,I can't belive sony actually made a movie of this...is next the invasion of fidget spinners?
ySy8mcceTno,"Good job Sony, you're like 6 years late! I'm still excited though because the digital artist who created the original Slenderman photo is supposedly directing or is helping create it."
ySy8mcceTno,This feels like something Freeform would make.
ySy8mcceTno,O HOMEM PALMITO

ySy8mcceTno,No way
ySy8mcceTno,"What’s next rise of the fidget spinners coming in 2030 ?


Edit:thx for so much likes =D"
ySy8mcceTno,To the point of 1:42 it felt like everything except slender man
ySy8mcceTno,4 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,let me guess: using this title to make a shitty horror again for money?
ySy8mcceTno,Only what? Like 5 years late?
ySy8mcceTno,Must be because I’m getting older I find this Shallow and pedantic. Haha
ySy8mcceTno,This is about 5 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm interested even though I don't know what's really going on. It definitely feels psychological since one of Slender Man's abilities is mind control. So we'll see. I hope this one delivers.

ySy8mcceTno,I alwase want to be in a movie tho
ySy8mcceTno,"Estuve esperando alrededor de 6 años para esto, sinceramente con los tiempos de ahora esto ya no va a generar ganancias como lo hubiera hecho hace 5 años, se ve del asco, como una película cliché de terror, con jumpscares una trama fuera de lugar y que el elemento principal (slender man) aparezca cada 20 minutos...
Una pérdida de ingresos..."
ySy8mcceTno,What a great way to start off 2011!
ySy8mcceTno,why the dislikes??
ySy8mcceTno,Loooooool :v
ySy8mcceTno,The scariest thing about the trailer was the Sony logo.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, horror genre is really milking the 'eyeball stab' these days aren't they?"
ySy8mcceTno,In my opinion this looks nothing like a slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't let it suck.
ySy8mcceTno,"""Insert logan paul joke cause I'm cool and funny"""

ySy8mcceTno,*HYPE*
ySy8mcceTno,Not scary at all

ySy8mcceTno,I thought we left him alone in 2010. Let's just let him take a break from fan girls.
ySy8mcceTno,Han pasado 84 años :'v
ySy8mcceTno,"Based off a story and a shitty 2012 game, we will try to revive this boring story with a shitty movie CLAP CLAP"
ySy8mcceTno,People still care about Slendy? Let the Creepypasta rest...
ySy8mcceTno,This woulda fucked me right up when I was about 12
ySy8mcceTno,Totally thought the camera was going to pan down on that last girl and she'd be holding 8 pieces of paper
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf, isnt this kind of disrespectful? I might be in the NBA with this reach, but is this based off the slenderman child murders?"
ySy8mcceTno,Did Logan Paul’s direct this in the Japanese suicide forest?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real or just something made by some child for a school project?
ySy8mcceTno,Great Vídeo :'3
ySy8mcceTno,"I have a feeling this isn't gonna be the best seeing that you only see slenderman like one time in the trailer, but it's just a trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,really dusturbing
ySy8mcceTno,they should of gotten Tim from Marble Hornets in here this would of made it x100 better
ySy8mcceTno,Muchos loquenderos están molestos por no incluirlos en los créditos
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm... looks good.
ySy8mcceTno,1:55 pensei que fosse o gemidão '-'
ySy8mcceTno,They ruined slender man. He’s suppose to be in a black suit and all white under. Smh
ySy8mcceTno,Who else watched this before a million views?
ySy8mcceTno,who asked for this?
ySy8mcceTno,*cough* Marble Hornets did it better. *cough*
ySy8mcceTno,this shows very little understanding of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,You’re a couple years late Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my God Slender Man movie it's real! 😱
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is super exited for this?
ySy8mcceTno,Plot twist Slenderman is Logan Paul filming you
ySy8mcceTno,Is logan paul the slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,Way to take a novel form of horror and inject it with a plague of cliches
ySy8mcceTno,He comes the fangirls
ySy8mcceTno,"""They would never make a Slenderman movie, it would be just, ""TRASH!"" 

Sony Pictures: ""Hold my beer..."""
ySy8mcceTno,Now Fangirls are gonna want a jeff the killer movie and it wouldn't be made because of obvious reasons
ySy8mcceTno,"Eu não sei o que dizer 
BRASIL"
ySy8mcceTno,Still probably won’t be as good as Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Oh man i reamember what happened with that girl who was stabbed by her friends fir slender man i dont think she will be watching this any time soon
ySy8mcceTno,This is Awesome!
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't suck
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer for me was all over the place! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,WOW.
ySy8mcceTno,Hecc yeah
ySy8mcceTno,"What is with this trend of a preview of the trailer before the actual trailer, it's dumb as hell."
ySy8mcceTno,this looks cheap and stupid looks like it has nothing to do whit slender man waste of time >:(
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no
ySy8mcceTno,A new death note movie
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is about 5 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie looks good and I know it will be entertaining, but I do not think it was the right time to get it out. Personally they had to do it in 2012 or 2013 since in those years slenderman gained a huge popularity and was and still is the most famous of the creepypastas. Now to release it 6 years after it became famous not only with its creepypasta, but also by its games (slenderman 8 pages, slender arrival, etc) was not a good one since as now in horror movies the great majority also lost their thanks, although movies like the witch of blair, the witch, anabelle 2, the spell 2 and it 2017 did well, even so many horror movies are bad as the new movie chucky and among others. Maybe they should have done it like they did it, that is, take out the movie of the character in his year that was very famous, in the case of it was in 1990 and from there they released the film and then in 2017 it came back with a remake, if They would have done so the Slenderman movie would have been amazing and scary and more if they had done a remake for 2018 or 2019 and people would be even happier with their return to the big screen.
Remember that it is my opinion and I do not say that I do not want to see the film clearly that I'm not excited to see it, what I'm saying is that I would have liked it while Slenderman was still famous.

PD: SONY DO NOT CAGUES LIKE EMOJIN !!!!!!!
PD2: for those who do not know it, I recommend seeing the creepypasta of slender man and the 84-b experiment that speaks of its origin.
PD3: I hope it does not end either as a covenant alien that everyone was excited like me and in the end it was a disappointment."
ySy8mcceTno,And... Slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"*little girl:* WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
*slender:* _closes in on the little girl and whispers_ gimme 20 dollors"
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 for the cameo from Jonathan the Gay Elephant.
ySy8mcceTno,Yyyyyeaaaah boi!
ySy8mcceTno,"Que porcaria, espero que o filme seja melhor que o trailer e espero que ele use terno"
ySy8mcceTno,WTF IS THIS!!!??? cmon...WTF!????
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are too late Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Well Slender man Finally Got A Movie
ySy8mcceTno,2012 strikes back
ySy8mcceTno,"They should have just uploaded a let's play and called it a day. There's no need to make a movie, since Slender is old news. And on that note, after that girl was stabbed by those two crazy girls as a sacrifice to Slender, I really don't want to see stuff like this anymore.

Also, there's a comment that check every single cliche in a horror movie trailer. You should check it out"

ySy8mcceTno,What a stupid trailer
ySy8mcceTno,One part I don't get is the bug part I mean adults do you know Slenderman much well adleast it must have paper on the trees and it better be good
ySy8mcceTno,Isso é bem perturbador kk
ySy8mcceTno,A bit too late on the trend sony. A bit too late.
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting for years to a slender man movie, i hope we gonna' get a Jeff the killer movie too :D"
ySy8mcceTno,NO

ySy8mcceTno,Terrible trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Врятли что то интересное
ySy8mcceTno,A little too late Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,It would've been better if they hadn't done a horror movie for this. This just looks terrible. They should've done a thriller. Not anywhere close to horror. Maybe where a detective investigates deaths and he finds the slender man that killed them?

ySy8mcceTno,Movie ideas are running out smh 😪
ySy8mcceTno,Brazil
ySy8mcceTno,What is this 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Yesssssss ❤

ySy8mcceTno,Now lets wait for slender gangdam style THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Excuse me WHAT. WHY. HOW? HUHHH???????
ySy8mcceTno,brasileiros?
ySy8mcceTno,"When you look at him at 2:13 he looks like a wooden figure or a puppet, lmfao. Also it sounds like another movie that will gross the heck out of people instead of scaring them. Slenderman is a creepypasta character kidnapping kids, why do you make him a character that looks like a result of a mental disorder or something."
ySy8mcceTno,Like stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Voltamos pra 2010?
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for that Spider-Man cameo.
ySy8mcceTno,this movie should have came out 10 years ago...when slender man was relevant.
ySy8mcceTno,Dang this Slenderman trailer sure feels like it's going to have nothing to do with Slenderman

ySy8mcceTno,2/10
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe it would have had a massive success in the early 2010’s. But a slender man movie in 2018? Seriously?
ySy8mcceTno,Sinceramente el trailer es desalentador no creo que sea una buena película
ySy8mcceTno,"Just, get your facts right. I like Slenderman just fine but I feel other creepypastas would work better as movies."
ySy8mcceTno,Will Logan Paul star?
ySy8mcceTno,Now i know I can’t be the only one who read spider man and not slender man right?

ySy8mcceTno,"2:20 

This sound immediately tells me, this is going to be a good movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, this is super disappointing. Doesn't seem to take any of the Marble Hornets story at all. Seems like horror movies these days are all about jump scares and gross out and they've neglected building of tensions and interesting plot lines."

ySy8mcceTno,When Slender man come out
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t know if they’ll do slender man justice. He’s famous for being completely unknown, they might give him exposition or ad on to his lore stuff he didn’t need. Overall it’ll be interesting how this plays out."
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie would’ve be a great way to start 2014, not 2018."
ySy8mcceTno,If they don't figure out a way to put the static in there I'll be disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if they'll add the botched sacrifice the two girls attempted for Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,Ward
ySy8mcceTno,Lol I thought it said spider man I was like whattt

ySy8mcceTno,"Men, I think slender is the reason that people in that japanese forest are dying (includind logan Paul)"
ySy8mcceTno,Lol. Now the teens are really going to have an excuse and kill seeing theres a movie made about him! 😛
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone else read this as spiderman at first
ySy8mcceTno,girl stabs her eye now my eye feels weird
ySy8mcceTno,You're late 5 years late 😒😒
ySy8mcceTno,"Good job of not actually showing his face, that's the whole point of him"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony make this good please and if you make a cinematic universe do movie by movie take pages from marvel and make the movies good do not make bad decisions I'm not a movie producer or writer but stay true to what slender man is to us and if you make a jeff the killer movie change the Origin so it's not confusing like it's creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,"For anyone wondering, the official release date is May 18 2018"
ySy8mcceTno,Garbage
ySy8mcceTno,well i’m sure the victim of the slender man stabbing is excited for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not impressed, at all."
ySy8mcceTno,Ufff parece que será una mierda de proporciones colosales jajja esperemos que no pero sí
ySy8mcceTno,Que hagan una de splendor man :v
ySy8mcceTno,This would the emoji movie if it was a horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is it coming out may 18 if so it's coming out on my bday
ySy8mcceTno,¡NIÑAS GRITONAS! Próximamente con un invitado especial... Selderman :v
ySy8mcceTno,What
ySy8mcceTno,Can we please have a really amazing video game movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Wow 2009 is gonna be such a good year!
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve bueno
ySy8mcceTno,Omg alv
ySy8mcceTno,Ha
ySy8mcceTno,I think it is a bit late for this
ySy8mcceTno,And this kids is why you stay with your parents.
ySy8mcceTno,"Now we need a SCP movie.

(No, Cabin In The Woods does not count.)"
ySy8mcceTno,Another big financial loss for Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,Siiiiii
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,I can't help but wonder if Sony is paying any of the people who made Slenderman a thing in the first place. Probably not. Honestly I'm just going to go watch Marble Hornets again.
ySy8mcceTno,Produced at the height of its popularity
ySy8mcceTno,Woah
ySy8mcceTno,"Walked in the woods
Found a d-dolla found a d-dolla"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey what is it rated pg13  or r
ySy8mcceTno,They should have had the static sound effect at the end.
ySy8mcceTno,"All these horror movie previews be the same - Dramatic music, there's a pause then A girl Screams 😂😂"
ySy8mcceTno,And where the heck is slender I only saw him once and the end wasn’t even a jump scare cause it’s pretty obvious that he was gonna jump out at her but I mean slender is mysterious you think he might do one thing but he’s gonna do the other. Sony why you gotta ruin another movie??
ySy8mcceTno,I never thought I'd see the day....... But I lowkey knew I was gonna see the day.
ySy8mcceTno,"You can already tell this movie is going to be trash. It's not gonna follow any of the lore behind slender man, it's gonna be more focused on the story then the horror. The game will have down a more successful job at being scary and intriguing than this."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they gonna actually show him
ySy8mcceTno,Gand fat gyi bc
ySy8mcceTno,Everyone forgot about the slender man there no need to make a movie
ySy8mcceTno,*Good or bad......... I'm still watching it*
ySy8mcceTno,Found slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,Se me hace muy mamado
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,Do we have to bring cringe to 2018??!!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like garbage
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,*FANGIRLS A LITTLE TOO HARD*
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is things about those 2 girls who tried to kill there  friend  for a sacrifice  for slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Wow I can't believe this is actually happening
ySy8mcceTno,i watched the thing 😦
ySy8mcceTno,Would've been cool if it were 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,"I was kinda hoping for a group of friends to go camping and hear voices, at night see pictures of the drawings like in the game, and again the scary parts. But I mean that girl stabbing her self I don’t think slender man would “make” anyone do anything like that cause isnt the whole point of slender man that he’s looking for his daughter?"
ySy8mcceTno,Would have been great in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,The scariest part was the Sony logo
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for this for years
ySy8mcceTno,demasiado sadica marico XD
ySy8mcceTno,Splenda man
ySy8mcceTno,Cagala cabron y te mato.jpg
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Why would they let Amy Pascel do this
ySy8mcceTno,Dey making movies outta everything now.
ySy8mcceTno,"No way
I entered a time machine to 2012!"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m going to assume from this trailer that Slender Man will actually show up only towards the end of the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I’m waiting for jake Paul to end his YouTube career
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch Marble Hornets. It's probaby 10x better than this will ever be
ySy8mcceTno,"Rated not for dumb or adults. Natural Born Killers the same. Don't blame movies ,books, games, or music for things others do. Clock Work Orange ...will there be a remake?"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow is cool
ySy8mcceTno,*14 year old white girls excitement intensifies*
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for the FNAF movie
ySy8mcceTno,"this movie would be a lot better if it had more concrete, more Giraffes, more toys r us references, a gay elephant named jonathan, and was directed by a sexy egyptian showing mid-drift named marik ishtar"
ySy8mcceTno,"They ruined Slender Man, nothing is sacred anymore"
ySy8mcceTno,Cmon guys let see if it’s going to be good. I mean the game was
ySy8mcceTno,So... we're getting a slenderman movie... but not TLOU?
ySy8mcceTno,I feel this movie would look better if it was found footage
ySy8mcceTno,Can already tell that this is just gonna be a run-of-the-mill horror ghost story full of jumpscares.
ySy8mcceTno,"From just the trailer you can tell it is going to be a disappointment. The trailer does not even show any plot outside of trying to scare people. They even used some if the same images twice. These were not built around any storyline at all, it is built around trying to creep people out."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony for the love of God please don't ruin him! I'm trusting you! >.<
ySy8mcceTno,Ssshhh... wait..... do you hear that? ( concrete sliding across the floor )
ySy8mcceTno,"I really don’t like the fact that this is a psychological film, that’s not what the games were about and that’s not what made them great."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted to hear screechy white noise. Instead I hear screechy white girl.
ySy8mcceTno,I see a lot of cliche in this trailer. I still have hope though.
ySy8mcceTno,Too bad it wasn't released in December...because the word TURKEY comes to mind
ySy8mcceTno,Ooooof
ySy8mcceTno,I got board watching this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,It feels sad we haven't gotten a Five Nights at Freddy's yet. Hopefully that gets better treatment then this.
ySy8mcceTno,Cientos de trailer y al final no veo ninguna pelicula >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Just put it on easy
ySy8mcceTno,"I love all those dummies who thinks that Slenderman is only about pages and proxies. At first it was a creepypasta only about the Slenderman, then it became a video game about finding pages.

Still, I'm excited, but also doubtfully for this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This gave me chills
ySy8mcceTno,I prefer Thinman from Supernatural
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp
Guess who’s not sleeping tonight"
ySy8mcceTno,slender: the arrival will have a better story than this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Que sad
ySy8mcceTno,tem alguém BR aqui ?
ySy8mcceTno,"Come on, let's be real here, it is way too soon to tell what type of movie this is going to be. The trailer doesn't reveal any information about the storyline, who the characters are, and they haven't even shown the full cast yet. The second trailer release will be very telling as to the direction they've taken it. Way too soon to gauge the quality and direction; I will remain hopeful until then."
ySy8mcceTno,Will a % of the takings go towards Payton Leutner's medical bills I wonder?
ySy8mcceTno,TAKE MY MONEY
ySy8mcceTno,When am I going to get a movie about spooky 🅱️ois?
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul starring as slender man
ySy8mcceTno,GAY HAVEN'T YOU HEAR ABOUT THE TWO GIRLS WHO STABBED A GIRL 19 TIMES JUST BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN SLENDERMAN
ySy8mcceTno,This is the most biggest knock off of Stranger Things if you ask me....
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things are u ?
ySy8mcceTno,Sinceramente se ve chafa
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems stupid hopefully its not about those girls that stabbed their friend for him, seems wrong movie for that"
ySy8mcceTno,Movie might be good but we haven't learned the concept from the trailer like every other movie for ex Happy death day. We had the whole concept from the trailer. But this is just random scenes from the movie. TF ?? This trailer is trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Despues de casi 6 años la hicieron :,)"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy just wants his 20 dollars
ySy8mcceTno,#4EnTendencia
ySy8mcceTno,Look im 12 yrs old but when this comes out. And its rated R. I'm watching no matter what!
ySy8mcceTno,HA Slendy beat ya to it Freddy
ySy8mcceTno,"It was a matter of time, I suppose."
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus Christ this looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,In 2012 I would’ve killed for this movie but In 2017 slender mans so dead No ones talked about him for years how about make a movie about creepy pastas that are still scary
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, does anyone know what town this movie is set in? I'm from Massachusetts, so I'm curious."
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like it won't be scary. 
Will probably rely on jumpscares."
ySy8mcceTno,Porn sexy hehehe my Pepe is big
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if other things from the Slenderman universe will appear like the Rake or proxies.
ySy8mcceTno,:c
ySy8mcceTno,"I think the movie might actually be good if it matches up with the lure of the game! It could be the first good video game movie, who knows?"
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this is going to be a disappointment
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good i guess
ySy8mcceTno,A bit fucking late there don't you think Sony
ySy8mcceTno,I can see a Ben Drowned/Jeff The KIller movie approaching quickly
ySy8mcceTno,To soon
ySy8mcceTno,"Horrible, la anatomía de Slenderman es de la amas terroríficas y no supieron usarla"
ySy8mcceTno,I have a feeling this is gonna be horrible
ySy8mcceTno,"Not sure how this movie will do but I like the concept of making movies based on creepypastas. Scary movies nowadays are just cash grab jumpscare garbage, so bringing in some psychological horror from these stories seems like a solution."
ySy8mcceTno,Why ?
ySy8mcceTno,"First emojis, then creepypastas? What’s next Sony? Memes? Are we gonna get the “Hey 🅱️eter Movie”? Boneless pizza? Or are you gonna go more classic like grumpy cat?"
ySy8mcceTno,"You should of made this in 2011 back then I wished for a slenderman movie... Yea when I was a kid, but now I'm a teen and it's 2018 and your making it a movie ???"
ySy8mcceTno,Yessssss!
ySy8mcceTno,Very Horror
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this give me the Ring vibes?
ySy8mcceTno,Lol ok ok last one im actually waiting for the Venom movie 2018.* Drops Laptop*
ySy8mcceTno,"I've waited for a slender man movie For Years, Sony better not mess this up, but they probably will."
ySy8mcceTno,Ala madre :v
ySy8mcceTno,The only video game movie I’m excited for would be tomb raider.
ySy8mcceTno,"Nothing like capitalising on a real tragedy, but that's Sony for you. I'll save my money for something like the Marvel Avengers film."
ySy8mcceTno,But why?
ySy8mcceTno,Cade os br pra dizer o quanto esse filme vai ser foda???
ySy8mcceTno,"come late stupid Sony, we know that Slenderman was invented for a contest in 4chan, also only rely on Screamer, learn DISNEY !!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a overly cliché horror flick targeted towards young teens.
ySy8mcceTno,"A couple years late but I ain’t complaining 
Sony better not screw up a horror legend"
ySy8mcceTno,bit late on this trend
ySy8mcceTno,Is there gonna be a special part for Logan Paul in there filming one of the dead girls?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman was so 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"WHERES THE LORE where's the notes, the thoughts about him, the stalking, everything that makes him scary? I swear he is being painted as just a demon in the woods. Also, wrong year, Sony"
ySy8mcceTno,Im waiting for the planet of the socials: the rise and fall of vine animation Sony biopic film out in 2027
ySy8mcceTno,Someone had to know that this was a bad idea right?
ySy8mcceTno,Yo ya lo quiero ver c mamaron con él trailer
ySy8mcceTno,It's a movie based off of a creepypasta that nobody has cared about for three years. It's gonna suck.
ySy8mcceTno,Anciosa pela estréia!! ❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,dumbest trailer ever were slender man at? like you ruined the concept
ySy8mcceTno,He just wants to know where the Applebees is
ySy8mcceTno,bueno por lo menos podria ser mejor pelicula que la de warcraft
ySy8mcceTno,I feel bad Marble hornets isn't getting any cash out of this when they are the ones who made slenderman relevant
ySy8mcceTno,"Can you see him? Yes, I did in the trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,Next they are going to make a Five nights Freddies movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Why are they making a movie based off a shitty game?? Am I missing something here??
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this day would come
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for someone to make this. I remember when the original photos starting coming out.
ySy8mcceTno,Like we need this stuff
ySy8mcceTno,"WTH, this is happening?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, please stick to electronics"
ySy8mcceTno,Waiting for the Sony biopic Justin Bieber is it too late to say sorry romcom with Selena Gomes 2020.
ySy8mcceTno,What does this even have to do with slender man other than his appearance
ySy8mcceTno,Movie  gonna suck so bad
ySy8mcceTno,Se supone daba miedo no? >:v
ySy8mcceTno,I mean...If you keep looking at him he can't get to you :x
ySy8mcceTno,"Theres been news about a ""slender man movie releasing"" since 2011. I dont know if i even believe this."
ySy8mcceTno,"I can see him but








*can he see me?*"
ySy8mcceTno,A little soon Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,ججججحححًخخخهععغفف
ySy8mcceTno,"No se ve tan Buena, pero esperare a que salga,  puede ser que me equivoque..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Maybe it would have been smarter to release this when it was relevant. You know, 5 years ago?"
ySy8mcceTno,Pewdiepie would love this.
ySy8mcceTno,If a horror movie isn’t directed by James Wan then I don’t want it. Looks cornyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,"Leave it to Sony to try to make a profit off of something that has been mined literally to death by the internet over the last several years, by making one of the most generic and blandly shot horror trailers, since, um...whatever the last one was."
ySy8mcceTno,"Your actually making this, I have wanted this"
ySy8mcceTno,This'll either be really bad or surprisingly good.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really stupid
ySy8mcceTno,It's so late to make a slender movie
ySy8mcceTno,Not gonna lie this looks like it could be amazing
ySy8mcceTno,"Like always, a movie made by old people for young audiences about a subject only young people know well."
ySy8mcceTno,"This game was cool... in 2014 and this movie would be cool... yet again, in 2014 i think you're a little late. All the slenderman games and all the slenderman knockoffs have been dead for about 3 years Jesus Christ Sony at first you made televisions then you made games consoles and now this? What's next fucking bread?"
ySy8mcceTno,IM SCREAMING THIS IS SO GREAT OMFG
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things 3 slender
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus like why can't horror movies just call the F.B.I on this dude. I mean it literally worked in Jason goes to hell where they blasted Jason to pieces. I guess Sony has to try to ""redeem"" themselves from the disaster if the emoji movie"
ySy8mcceTno,GIMME TWENTY DOLLAS
ySy8mcceTno,One thing's for sure: This will either be the last gasp of the Slender Man legend or re-ignite the hype of 2013.
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel it will be another disappointment to adapt a Creepypasta to a movie, even more than the first Creepypasta that you know everyone adapted to a movie, but sadly I feel that we will disappoint everyone who knows the movie, and the Creepypasta as well, The game Those who know him, both in history and design of the character, hopefully they can handle this character very well, adapt it very well to its original story, and we are satisfied with this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol this isn’t even scary, like who tf is Natalie"
ySy8mcceTno,I bet you anything SLENDERMAN is just going to show up for like 5 seconds in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when this was a game where you collect 7 pieces of paper before he gets you?
ySy8mcceTno,this totally isn't 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is 5 years late on slender man hype train
ySy8mcceTno,This seems like a fan made trailer pfft haha
ySy8mcceTno,So...arw we getting a creepypasta movie universe
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow this trailer has all the clichés!
Scary kid✅
Laughing babies✅
Jumpscare✅
Bells ringing✅
Dramatic “Where is my daughter?”✅
Single notes✅
Suicide✅

Let me know what else did you find!"
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't we learn what happened to the Mario movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"This would have been cooler if Slenderman was just an imaginary thing, and the characters become insane by the thought of his presence. A more Lovecraftian thing. Children should be the protagonists of this film, though"
ySy8mcceTno,There better be a jailbreak cameo
ySy8mcceTno,The film will start with an emoji movie reference hopefully
ySy8mcceTno,Meh. Provokes disgust more than fear.
ySy8mcceTno,"The Ring, you are not."
ySy8mcceTno,Prepare for cringe
ySy8mcceTno,Worst. Trailer. Ever.
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for a Slender Man movie for longest 😄
ySy8mcceTno,I really don't think this will make it in theaters
ySy8mcceTno,EVERYONE CALL MARKIPLIER
ySy8mcceTno,They just showed the whole movie in 2:39.
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look that good... Sorry not sorry
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this looks amazing
ySy8mcceTno,"This was clearly made by studio executives trying to keep up with teenage fads. ""Hey you know what's hip and chill with the teens? The Slender man. Totally rad, right kids? We know what you like, we're speaking the same language, dudes! Super tight!"""
ySy8mcceTno,only if they could cast the gamers 😥
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so dumb. That was the worst movie trailer I've ever seen!
ySy8mcceTno,Congratulations! You screw up the best creepy past of de 2009!
ySy8mcceTno,"to those who dont know what is slenderman, he is an imaginary horror creature, a creepypasta, not a game.
Still i wonder why no movie maker ever made a movie about creepypasta? some is them are perfect material for horror movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Im going full screen wish me luck
ySy8mcceTno,YO WOT DA FUK
ySy8mcceTno,"“People just don’t disappear” uh, yes they do all over the world, for a while now."
ySy8mcceTno,im just sitting here waiting for this movie to fail as both horror and as a movie
ySy8mcceTno,That made as much sense as non sense.
ySy8mcceTno,Are we back in 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this meme died 3 years ago...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,43 seconds in i will stop. trailers summarize the movie nowadays
ySy8mcceTno,When you make a movie but it’s 5 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,Splendorman
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man ain't scary make the rake movie
ySy8mcceTno,finaly
ySy8mcceTno,reminds me of the horror videos that skinny dude from the office watched
ySy8mcceTno,Literally had nightmares about Slender in 2012. Definately not going to trigger that again.
ySy8mcceTno,Ammmaaaaziiiin
ySy8mcceTno,I’m just waiting for the SlenderMan Gangnam Style Dude Movie. eduup better get on it
ySy8mcceTno,I wait too long for this day
ySy8mcceTno,Ooo my coworker’s brother is one of the extras in the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Man this is dark for a slender man movie but it was just a game back in 2012 but now it's a movie
ySy8mcceTno,ERMYGERD I CAN'T WAIT!
ySy8mcceTno,Logan paul probably will be laughing at the victims hanging in the forest.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it said spiderman...
ySy8mcceTno,Well there couldn't be two years in a row of good horror movies.
ySy8mcceTno,Make jeff the killer instead
ySy8mcceTno,"Jesus said ""So it will be at the end of the age,the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw them into the furnace of fire, in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" Matthew 13:49-50. Jesus also said ""You are my friends if you do what I command you."" John 15:14. Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master, repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6."
ySy8mcceTno,Hell. No.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks good
ySy8mcceTno,Soy el unico que piensa que esta pelicula va a terminar siendo una mierda?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks interesting but it doesn’t feel like slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Glad to see someone doing a slender man movie right this time
ySy8mcceTno,"This is made by Sony Pictures, and I’m not really sure if this is going to be great and all that."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,I never thought I’d see the day.
ySy8mcceTno,Pages found 1/8
ySy8mcceTno,"Espero que la película sea buena, ya que el trailer no me gusto :/"
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when I was little I thought slender man was the tall black guy from Minecraft
ySy8mcceTno,Slender return
ySy8mcceTno,Sony pictures needs to stop with these shitty movie adaptations of Internet games and media.
ySy8mcceTno,"So uhh... about that fnaf movie that was supposed to come out years ago, we didnt even get a trailer was it cancelled off or something?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya llego tarde ya paso de moda eso
Pero mejor tarde que nunca :D"
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean it probably isn't gonna be good, but there is always the hope"
ySy8mcceTno,anyone else disappointed?
ySy8mcceTno,Vemgo por el momo de lh :V
ySy8mcceTno,NO WAY !!! He is coming back . :D (in a movie)
ySy8mcceTno,The baby's laughter near the end was dumb
ySy8mcceTno,"Guess what?







I'm not going to sleep tonight"
ySy8mcceTno,*sigh* just go watch Marble Hornets if you want to watch a good OPERATOR movie. This movie looks really bad just as bad as that one movie Always Watching. I would love to see a good creepypasta movie but it just seem it cant be done.
ySy8mcceTno,I HAVE BEEN WAITING !!!!!😍😍😍👌
ySy8mcceTno,Oh come on! NooooooOOOoooo!
ySy8mcceTno,Not surprising coming from Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,I am a potato
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a movie then
ySy8mcceTno,"But can Sony Pictures top ThE EmOjI MoViE with this film, probably not"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is old though.
ySy8mcceTno,Ok slender man. How about a FNAF trailer now?
ySy8mcceTno,I usually do not judge a film by the trailer but you know it's going to be a bad one if you add ROARS which are supposed to be Slenderman's screams.
ySy8mcceTno,From producers that brought you Hotel Transylvania
ySy8mcceTno,"You don’t just go on your phone or computer and go... oh pfft slime, we could make a movie about a kid making slime and it got hit with a meteor and now it can talk"
ySy8mcceTno,I got sp00ked.
ySy8mcceTno,better than the Emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,Really Sony? Is u gonna cast the two girls who tool the girl into the woods?
ySy8mcceTno,So hyped
ySy8mcceTno,Y Donde estan Los Hispano hablantes ?? Diganme que piensan de la peli ?
ySy8mcceTno,"sorry sony, you're a little late to the party on this one buddy."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Putain j'ai hâte que ça sorte
ySy8mcceTno,Yes yes yes
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer doesn’t say, but this movie comes out in theaters on May 18th 2018"
ySy8mcceTno,It's him.... Slender Boiiiiiii
ySy8mcceTno,That one girl that looked away from Slender Man and he was a few yards away YOU FOOL if you want to survive from him keep looking at him so he doesn't move.
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m sure if they made this around 2009 it would have blown up but not now I mean I’ll watch it still, but I don’t think it’s gonna be successful in all honesty"
ySy8mcceTno,Un comentario en español 7u7
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta fans are going to be lining up in theaters
ySy8mcceTno,"Hi I'm blind, is this a movie about Weight Loss?"
ySy8mcceTno,They made a movie about this wow that’s crazy
ySy8mcceTno,Yes finally
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a b-movie. Somebody call James Wan.
ySy8mcceTno,they shouldve made this in 2012 cause THTS when slender man was popular now idk
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't ruin it like the emoji movie and the Ghostbusters reebot
ySy8mcceTno,Yesss! Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Los invito a pasar a la morgue 💀
ySy8mcceTno,"I had hopes for this film but then I realized it’s gonna be the same bullshit as the other shitty horror movies, loosely following the lore and making it where the creature can possess people to instantly kill themselves"
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this won't end up like smiley.
ySy8mcceTno,WHY IS IT ONLY LIKE 1 PERSON IF THAT WAS ME I WOULD OF BEEN OUTTA THERE LIKE MOVE!
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,"We’re making Creepypastas movies now? Sony please, get new ideas besides making a horror movie based off a 2013-14 PC game."
ySy8mcceTno,Still better than the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,I'm triggered.
ySy8mcceTno,"My profile pic is Jeff the killer...

This is a slender man trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,İzlerken korkup telefonu yan çeviren +1
ySy8mcceTno,"I was expecting something close to the IT movie or stranger things where people randomly disappear and not that final destination type movie where people randomly die (im basing it on the girl stabbing her eye)

But to be honest slenderman was popular in 2012 and not many people talk about it"
ySy8mcceTno,You did not... you fucking... did... not |:(
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe 5 years late to the hype
ySy8mcceTno,Why are the four top comments all from the same dude? 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,"If it doesn't have a good story line, it's gonna be disappointing. If it's just a movie with Gore and it's meant to scare people, it's not gonna be and interesting."
ySy8mcceTno,Why only little girls? I thought he would haunt lil boys too.
ySy8mcceTno,5 nights at you know who coming next year
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like it would be better if it was a found footage film.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is based off a game. Nope. This movie is based off the Marble Hornets YouTube series. Nope. This movie is based off a creepypasta. Sure. Will this movie be bad? Yes.
ySy8mcceTno,4 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one that thought this trailer made literally below 0% sense
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like the sort of thing paul logan will like
ySy8mcceTno,"Unpopular opinion: I’m actually kind of hyped about this movie, despite it being so late"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,I’m gonna see this scary movies do terrify me sometimes but I like this franchise I’ve watched mark Felix dan Phil so I hope it’s good
ySy8mcceTno,This movie's gonna be a total disappointment
ySy8mcceTno,Pero si es real por que ya han echo varios trailers o fanmade que pienso que ed el trailer original alvv>:v
ySy8mcceTno,"If nothing else, I find it interesting how they’re focusing on the psychological aspects of the Slender Man and what just his image can do to somebody, rather than just having him chase some random person through the woods for 2 hours"
ySy8mcceTno,Why the top 4 comment belong to same guy tf?
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly this trailer is descent once you take the time to understand it. But that’s the thing people shouldn’t need to take the time to understand this so they should of made this trailer more story based so we can understand what is going on. For now I ehh with this but hopefully the next trailer will improve and really show the true power of slender man without spoiling too much.
ySy8mcceTno,Better than the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman isn't really as big a name as it was a few years ago, but, based on the scenes in this trailer, I can see it being scary if it is actually done with some effort.

However, that possibility is at a low reach. I'll just stick with Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,"I love how it takes them like at least 6 years, and a full movie production cycle to produce something that people have done better/more effective on their own, with handheld cameras, and a few friends. (Marble Hornets, EverymanHYBRID, TribeTwelve)"
ySy8mcceTno,TOOK YOU GUYS LONG ENOUGH SLENDERMAN WAS POPULAR LIKE 6 YEARS AGO
ySy8mcceTno,Venom (2018)
ySy8mcceTno,Shouldn't they make it like a found footage film?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a Netflix movie
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for the fidget spinner movie
ySy8mcceTno,This reminded me of the happening
ySy8mcceTno,So who else is hoping for his proxies?
ySy8mcceTno,Sony c'mon you gotta make the trailer good if you want people to actually watch this
ySy8mcceTno,So boooooring
ySy8mcceTno,So hyped
ySy8mcceTno,I can't even watch Joey Graceffa play the game D:
ySy8mcceTno,"Let’s just hope this actually relates to the creepypasta of Slender Man

The 8 pages better be there, and if no this movie is fuckin dead

There better be a camera recording during in the movie

There better be a white faced slender man in a tuxedo that’s very tall and slim with long stick like arms

There BETTER be no relation to the stupid girl stabbing her friend for a fucking myth


This better not be a let down"
ySy8mcceTno,"This better be good, I love Slender"
ySy8mcceTno,anything Sony automatically sucks
ySy8mcceTno,This can be a really good movie or a really bad one
ySy8mcceTno,DONT MAKE MOVIES OFF OF GAMES!!!!! STOOOOOOPPPPPP
ySy8mcceTno,you better pick up those notes quick
ySy8mcceTno,5 yrs too late
ySy8mcceTno,You're 10 years late Sony. Should have made the movie when we were actually interested.
ySy8mcceTno,So late but dang looks pretty good
ySy8mcceTno,Visually looks good. I don't know about the plot though :/
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: Oh cool, a Slender Man movie!

(Sees Sony’s name in the title)

Me: Oh crap, a Slender Man movie by Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,This seems kinda bad for a movie based off a game about getting pages
ySy8mcceTno,YA NO ES 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Who the hell would realease a slendermsn movie in 2018? oh... a Sony film...
ySy8mcceTno,"*directed by logan paul*

Expect to see some very disturbing close shots :("
ySy8mcceTno,So excited
ySy8mcceTno,Get out of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf! :’v
ySy8mcceTno,"You're about 4 years too late sony, plus it looks like hot garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not gonna be surprised if all the characters are emojis.
ySy8mcceTno,A little too  late don’t you think?
ySy8mcceTno,THey better get this right or I’ll walk right up to Sony and punch all their employees in the face for ruining everything
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like more a psychological movie than a monster movie
ySy8mcceTno,I think I just saw a hanging dead guy and a vlogger in that forest
ySy8mcceTno,I'll could make a far more better scary movie than this crap.
ySy8mcceTno,Where was this in 2012 when he was still relevant
ySy8mcceTno,Sony don’t make this movie. It’s gonna be garbage. Just make the spiderverse movie as good as good can be
ySy8mcceTno,Bit late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood I am disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,Have you guys passed through new jersey.. with the slender man warnings on the rock walls?!...crazy creepy. Especially after watching marble hornets.. this movie has nothing on that channel
ySy8mcceTno,So it’s about nothing....
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yeah all the kids play slenderman games today make sure to put the gangdam style dance in there
ySy8mcceTno,They tried making one years ago but failed. Hope this ones better.
ySy8mcceTno,tengo miedo
ySy8mcceTno,annoying trailer and nothing special
ySy8mcceTno,What used to be just a creepypasta has now become an official movie!
ySy8mcceTno,What's so scary about a skinny man?
ySy8mcceTno,This film is like 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,First they do the emoji movie and then show this scary stuff
ySy8mcceTno,i wanna die
ySy8mcceTno,puta no que miedo D:
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would win: a bunch of cops on the case, or one slendy boi?"
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone take into consideration watching this that a little girl almost died from this. It’s disgusting how Sony makes a movie about a character that almost had a girl murdered. Think about that girl and her family if she ever saw this. Disgusting
ySy8mcceTno,"Uh
If bullet was effective on slender man
Is going not me so horror ._."
ySy8mcceTno,welcome to 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer looks promising but it might turn bad but I won't regret watching the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Boring trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Cool, but you're only like 6 years late on the trend."
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t really get all the blind hate. This could be a really interesting movie and so far the production value doesn’t look bad at all. I feel like people are just hating on it because “oooo it’s slender it’s that old 2008 game that I forgot about.” Honestly this could be a really cool psychological horror/thriller movie and i feel as though people should give it a chance.
ySy8mcceTno,I can just see this movie falling
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like some shitty student film rather than a big budget production.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real or just made up?
ySy8mcceTno,A girl murderd two people let's make a movie
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like a fake fan made trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman's not even wearing the suit!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This can only end badly. If the movie is bad then it's just another bad movie. But if this movie defies all the odd and whinds up being good and gets well received, it's not gonna stop. Jeff the Killer, Smile Dog, The Rake, No End House. There are some Creep Pastas that would make for a good movie, but this is Hollywood we're talking about. I repeat, this can Only, end badly."
ySy8mcceTno,"No veo que aparezca slenderman, solo chicas gritando -_-"
ySy8mcceTno,Or you can also try #trailerretry #retrySonytrailer #2ndtrailershallbebetter or just #2ndtrailer #Icantseehiminthetrailer #whereisslendystrailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Absolutely none of this looks remotely close to canonical Slenderman lore. Marble Hornets became a farce of itself by the end but at least it was legitimately terrifying for a while. With a major production company behind it, it shouldn't be hard to find talented writers who could write a better, scarier story than two college guys with a handycam and a film school budget. But of course, Hollywood wants to continue bombarding us with weak plots, cheap jump scares, and gratuitous gore rather than anything with substance."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man died out a long time ago
ySy8mcceTno,"2018? With bad trailer editing, I thought it was 2005!"
ySy8mcceTno,ok...wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Look. It’s the ripoff of DCs The Question. I’m not fucking joking. I will debate you till the heat death of the universe that slender man is a ripoff of the question
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I have been waiting for this movie since 2014!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I remember learning g about slender man in the 4th grade now I'm in the 10th only thing we need now is Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,i am going insane
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, come on. The last decent film you've made this year was basically made by another studio with you getting all the checks and profit. Just stick to making video games and decent TVs."
ySy8mcceTno,the only part of this trailer that had anything to do with slendy was when he actually appeared on screen. #notmyslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,omfg
ySy8mcceTno,Looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's scarier than the emojji movie
ySy8mcceTno,A little late to the party arent we boys
ySy8mcceTno,creepypasata fans can finally rejoice
ySy8mcceTno,"How many successful movie adaptations of video games are there?
🎥🎮"
ySy8mcceTno,This gonna be the best movie of 2011 hands down
ySy8mcceTno,Español Tranquilo deje si comentario aki abajo
ySy8mcceTno,Make Slenderman great again
ySy8mcceTno,#Sonyneedstrailerretries
ySy8mcceTno,shooketh
ySy8mcceTno,I am so friggin' hyped.
ySy8mcceTno,The little girl reminds me of Jamie from Halloween 4 and 5 lol
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell its bad... disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,"The film was actually shot in the town right next to me: Ayer Massachusetts. Got to go on the hot set since my father had clearance at the school they were shooting at. It is too soon to tell what type of movie this is going to be. The trailer doesn't reveal any information about the storyline, who the characters are, and they haven't even shown the full cast yet. The second trailer release will be very telling as to the direction they've taken it. Way too soon to gauge the quality and direction, however; the color grading is pretty creepy and stylized."
ySy8mcceTno,"Hate to say it, but...ABOUT TIME!"
ySy8mcceTno,yalaannnnn slendermanı YİGİT ABİM ÖLDÜRDÜÜÜÜ
ySy8mcceTno,Will someone shoot him down or uncover his face?
ySy8mcceTno,"Could this mean, that finally, big budget film creators will be making movies on popular internet.. Creepypastas and such?


SCP-Foundation with all of their anomalies could be a good topic for a movie."
ySy8mcceTno,TL;DW
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSSSSSS YESSSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,Staring John Cena #youcantseeme
ySy8mcceTno,this looks pretty good tbh i’m gonna make my friend watch this who can’t even look at a horror trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Way to start off the year with a movie that looks like it would be a disappointment.
ySy8mcceTno,"No, I'm good..."
ySy8mcceTno,Nice job trynna capitalize on the popularity of creepypastas sony - free ideas for movies you can use without having to credit anyone. Pathetic.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is a black person now lel
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy. This looks like garbage. I can't wait.
ySy8mcceTno,I lived to see it
ySy8mcceTno,That was very disappointing.
ySy8mcceTno,Era Mejor La De DEAR DAVID
ySy8mcceTno,"No, no, no Slender became irrelevant years ago this is not happening again"
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks dumb. Sorry, but it does."
ySy8mcceTno,Yes! Slenderman has always been my favorite.
ySy8mcceTno,Late x1
ySy8mcceTno,"it was never proven that slender man killed (or according to this trailer, make children hurt themselves) .. he abducts them for unknown reasons"
ySy8mcceTno,Alv siento que va a ser una caca esta película :v
ySy8mcceTno,"I just hope this movie turn into a great success, unlike other game related movies. There's still hope guys, let's keep it that way at the moment."
ySy8mcceTno,Flop.
ySy8mcceTno,Soon Jeff the Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,"ok,no
idc watch this"
ySy8mcceTno,"""too many sound effects"" If you couldn't read it says trailer. I mean Jesus. And what if it being different makes it somewhat better? You'll never know."
ySy8mcceTno,i waited to much for this
ySy8mcceTno,looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,I am very disappointed .. that looks nothing like slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Based on the murder those two girls
ySy8mcceTno,Is Sony don't expect nothing
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is this trending? It looks like a documentary on insects and maggots, it was so prominent in the trailer I would think people would be more grossed out than horrified."
ySy8mcceTno,Ok honestly didn't think I'd like it but tbh I think this looks great
ySy8mcceTno,I could've sworn we already had a slenderman movie...
ySy8mcceTno,"At first I was excited about this movie, but then I saw who was producing and saw the entire trailer, and now I'm scared, not because of the movie, but because these are the same people who made the Emoji movie, and Slender Man is known to be very silent, that's why you never him coming, but this trailer just ruined that, I didn't get scared at all, I'm sorry to say to the fans but this movie is doomed to fail..."
ySy8mcceTno,Is it bad I felt like laughing through this whole thing....
ySy8mcceTno,"Tbh Slender-Man would make an awesome topic for a movie, but this doesn’t really cut it..."
ySy8mcceTno,Octopus man
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly I wasn't too impressed by the trailer, but I will keep an eye on this, simply for the fact that it's an internet spawned sensation that got Hollywood's attention"
ySy8mcceTno,Or just watch Marble Hornets instead.
ySy8mcceTno,CAN EVERYONE IN THE COMMENTS SHUT THE F*** UP ABOUT LOGAN PAUL?!? This movie was made long before the incident EVEN HAPPENED
ySy8mcceTno,Did they just ask me to watch a trailer after I've specifically clicked on their trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no
ySy8mcceTno,"Not really scary, kind of a cliché to A LOT of scary movies."
ySy8mcceTno,"Boi oh Boi, looks like a film I'm NOT going to watch!! I don't ever watch scary movies, solely because I'm paranoid af. I will say, however, that I will be highly disappointed if I hear that this movie doesn't at LEAST have Masky."
ySy8mcceTno,Most anticipated movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm Logan Paul lel
I love chatchemall poke-slendermans"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh demon is oficial
ySy8mcceTno,They should’ve made this years ago when Slenderman was still relevant
ySy8mcceTno,The first part was weird
ySy8mcceTno,"Man, Sony will make just about any movie these days..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Just by the trailer, it looks like its trying to hard to be the shining and freddy kruger"
ySy8mcceTno,*_Slender man. The movie noone cared for_*
ySy8mcceTno,I sense a cinematic universe on its way...
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like they put a lot of thought and effort into this....but it just doesn't look interesting enough for me to bother
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta Cinematic Universe please
ySy8mcceTno,When's it coming out???
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they tease the proxies
ySy8mcceTno,stop
ySy8mcceTno,Hola para la proxima pelicula disputes de slender man la pelicula la otra pelicula podria Ser de Jeff the killer o Eyeless Jack?😕😕😕😕
ySy8mcceTno,"Too bad we couldn't have it as the original ""Concrete giraffes"", would have watched it then :/"
ySy8mcceTno,9 años tarde.
ySy8mcceTno,Let's hope the actual movie is better than the shitty trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks so bad tbh
ySy8mcceTno,This is stupid
ySy8mcceTno,@ fellow creepypasta fans.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello for the next movie after the slender man film ,the another could be Jeff the killer or Eyeless Jack??😕😕😕😕😕"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hollywood sin ideas?!!, donde?!."
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is about 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,No mames xD
ySy8mcceTno,"If this doesn't stick to the pages
then I'm not giving this movie a single chance......."
ySy8mcceTno,Next up: Creepypasta Cinematic Universe
ySy8mcceTno,I wish so badly that mainstream media would keep its greasy tendrils out of what they have no right to even touch.
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing in this trailer makes me think of Slenderman except for the last 40 seconds.
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora si se viene lo chido v:
ySy8mcceTno,Nah... Marble Hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,Anybody else getting the ring vibes
ySy8mcceTno,HELL YES
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve aburrida
ySy8mcceTno,AI MEU C* NÃO ACREDITO :O
ySy8mcceTno,Why no jumpscare
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch the Emos unite to take up every seat in the theater
ySy8mcceTno,Ok...
ySy8mcceTno,Who else but Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,"Did anyone notice how There's a body hanging in the background. Quick someone call Logan Paul. 
Sincerely: Mike Roanus"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Gaaaaay he’s not even wearing a suit
ySy8mcceTno,A little late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I LOVEED THE GAME NOW I LOVE THIS HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,New spider man looks great
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a bunch of weirdness I can't even tell what's going on
ySy8mcceTno,Why do they make a trailer in 2018 when slederman was trending in 2010
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was Spider-Man too.
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like they really changed the meaning and story behind Slenderman...guess what movie I ain't waisting money on...this one bc 1 the trailer no where near showed any sign of Slenderman 2 the movie looks pretty dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Took them long enough.
ySy8mcceTno,"lol, no thanks."
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all are hating but my childhood is shook.
ySy8mcceTno,Joey king
ySy8mcceTno,weak
ySy8mcceTno,"woah, now I have something to be exited about, it was a good creepypasta so its probably going to be a good movie"
ySy8mcceTno,No. No. No. No. Please god no. Slender Man has been dead for years and isn't scary anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres slenderman....?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this  R Rated
ySy8mcceTno,Its John Podesta
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender is now a movie, anything can happen if you don’t believe in it, at least for me. I didn’t think there would be one."
ySy8mcceTno,It looks really cheap
ySy8mcceTno,Not interested
ySy8mcceTno,"I was anticipating a Marble Hornets-esque movie, but I guess this is exciting too. ://"
ySy8mcceTno,But idk I guess we'll have to see
ySy8mcceTno,The madlads actually did it
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is so desperate
ySy8mcceTno,"I.....did not know a movie for Slendy was a thing, FNAF sure but not Slendy. So I'm taking it that The Creepypasta Cinematic Universe is now a thing due to the failed Dark Universe eh?"
ySy8mcceTno,No thanks
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda expected this to come out a few years ago. It's about time I guess. This is not based on a video game by the way. A lot of morons in here.
ySy8mcceTno,"I cant tell, is this about the game's lore or the girls who killed that person becaise slender man told them to do it?"
ySy8mcceTno,Azta ERRE MÁR RÉG OTTA VÁRTAM YEEE
ySy8mcceTno,like 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Nobody asked for this
ySy8mcceTno,Didn't feel close to being Slender Man at all for me. Looks like any other horror movie with Slender Man's name on it.
ySy8mcceTno,"Lets just pray we get a good film out of this, better to be optimistic in these situations."
ySy8mcceTno,A few years late
ySy8mcceTno,Its not April yet
ySy8mcceTno,"Only 4 years after the slenderman trend ended, no biggy."
ySy8mcceTno,It’s probably not gonna be that good
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks like a psychopath
Kind of horror
I think It could use more monster
Than person"
ySy8mcceTno,I think I just saw the whole movie 🎥🍿 thanks lol
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/31a-zPxx76E
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/31a-zPxx76E
ySy8mcceTno,Annual junk movie， I think so~
ySy8mcceTno,coooool
ySy8mcceTno,They better give money to the original game creators
ySy8mcceTno,OMG THAT'S AMAZING!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Yeahh.... this is gonna be bad. Definentley no the type of Slender Man movie I was expecting.
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all 6 years too late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,I wander if they'll make a reference to those two girls stabbing their friend in the woods just to meet slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,If you wanna see a better Slenderman story just watch Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,It's a Jhon Cena film.. cuz i can't see him
ySy8mcceTno,"Omg I have been waiting for this!  As other people said in the comments, I am not a fan of creepypasta as well, but slenderman is my favorite, whatever you call it.  So I’m pretty excited!  Even though I hate scary movies xD"
ySy8mcceTno,This would be acceptable like 7 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Can wait to go waste 15$ for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Bout
Time"
ySy8mcceTno,OH. MY. GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
ySy8mcceTno,"I am actually interested in this, even after all this time."
ySy8mcceTno,#can you see him😱
ySy8mcceTno,"About time
I've been playing scream fortress 
And the original slender
So this is good"
ySy8mcceTno,Loving that something that started out as a photoshopped picture and creepypasta ended in a mainstream audience hope for more stuff like this in the future
ySy8mcceTno,Another blair witch
ySy8mcceTno,you are a bit late
ySy8mcceTno,"Spoiler





R rated"
ySy8mcceTno,Yes finally!!!!!!!

ySy8mcceTno,High hopes. Low expectations.
ySy8mcceTno,Scp movie when?
ySy8mcceTno,YEAH BOIII FINNALY SLENDERMAN!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Let me guess the movie will be full of pointless trendy things like dabbing, selfies, and other stupid crap like that?"

ySy8mcceTno,Loving it
ySy8mcceTno,THE HOTTEST MOVIE OF 2011.

ySy8mcceTno,I expected better
ySy8mcceTno,So scary😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Why do the vast majority of us know about slender man? Because of those two little girls who tried to stab their friend to death. This movie was made to make money. The driving force behind that is us knowing about slender man because of an attempted murder.

I'm no fucking snowflake and even I think this is morally low."

ySy8mcceTno,this looks so cheesy
ySy8mcceTno,What a way to start 2018.
ySy8mcceTno,"Watching it full screen, wish me luck :("
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember when Slender Man was relevant. I was still in high school... that was 6 years ago.
If it takes 6 years to make a movie about a trending topic, then don't buy the rights. Nobody cares anymore."
ySy8mcceTno,Thought of stranger things when a bunch of things came out of her mouth
ySy8mcceTno,"After the Wisconsin thing, they never should've made this movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Hit the mark a few year late. Lol
ySy8mcceTno,Selender man ruined confirmed
ySy8mcceTno,LOL
ySy8mcceTno,I bet Logan Paul found a dead body in this forest and films it and made this movie
ySy8mcceTno,He returning for REVENGE
ySy8mcceTno,This looks incredible
ySy8mcceTno,😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS!!
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man isn’t even scary nor does this movie even slightly look scary
ySy8mcceTno,"Trailer disappointed me, hopefully the movie is good."
ySy8mcceTno,GOOSE BUMPS INCOMING
ySy8mcceTno,History does not bode well for the quality of this film
ySy8mcceTno,I was told there was a gay elephant noise at 1:23 and there was none. I'm sad now
ySy8mcceTno,"Why does this exist Slender man died years ago for me, if this movie doesn't have anything from the games I will lose all faith in the movie industry 




(again)"
ySy8mcceTno,"They already made a Slender movie, I don't remember what it was called but basically it was the style of lost footage and it sucked, but this movie is written by the person who created the original Slenderman Mythos, so it could actually be good, the only problem is the director's vision of the script, so it's up to the director to portray it properly."
ySy8mcceTno,I waited so long for this that I'm legit crying 😂
ySy8mcceTno,If they have someone collect 8 pages I'm gonna cry laughing
ySy8mcceTno,"If you go to 1 minute 23 seconds, you can HEAR the gay elephant noise!"
ySy8mcceTno,sb needs to put a pewdiepie fasecam over this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,SCARY MOVIE ALERT
ySy8mcceTno,Um... Slenderman has been irrelevant for a while now
ySy8mcceTno,Are they gonna collect the 8 pages oppa gangnam style?
ySy8mcceTno,Русские вы тут?
ySy8mcceTno,Double toasted brought me here
ySy8mcceTno,Nigga it’s 2:46 where I’m at I’m not getting to sleep no more
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know this looks stupid,it's going to be like the Godzilla movie in 2014,we are going to see Slenderman for only a couple of minutes and the rest of the movie is just kids wanting to kill themselves"
ySy8mcceTno,If this is legit then i will be first in line to see  this movie...i have waited years for this :D
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else feeling like this movie is in poor taste considering that little girl who got stabbed a couple years ago by another girl who thought she could summon a real slender man? #toosoonbro
ySy8mcceTno,Cool now make a 5 nights at Freddy's movie?! Ehh
ySy8mcceTno,this looks alot better than expected
ySy8mcceTno,"Just hope the girl that got stabbed over this dumb character is mentally prepared for this stupid movie which is supposed to entertain people. Seriously Sony, what were you thinking?"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:27 reminds me of The Ring video when she falls off of the cliff or whatever it was, lol."
ySy8mcceTno,I love Transformers!
ySy8mcceTno,"Lets just hope this won't be a flop
there weren't many great horror movies this year
2 in my account so fingers crossed"
ySy8mcceTno,Literally only clicked to see the comments 😂😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,What the hell did i just watched?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy it’s slender
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que o filme agrade mais do que esse trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman? Wasn't that an overhyped low quality trash game in 2012? Why make a movie out of it 6 years later?
ySy8mcceTno,Pass
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this is a joke
ySy8mcceTno,They are wayyyyyy to late to properly milk this franchise...
ySy8mcceTno,"Didn’t Slenderman died off in 2011..?

Yeah I thought so..."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this an adaptation from the game cuz that would be cool
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,Scary
ySy8mcceTno,You're about 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Does this mean we're  gonna get Jeff the killer too?
ySy8mcceTno,Well Sony your about 3 to 4 Year’s late.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Soundtrack is perfect for a SCP Containment Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"A decade too late dear Sony.  
A decade too late😂"
ySy8mcceTno,Why not Jeff the killer or the unwanted house guest or eyeless jack
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Sony only 6 years since slender man was relevant way to strike when the kettle is still hot
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't think this was real
ySy8mcceTno,"1:53 if any littlekurriboh fan is here
here are the gay elephant noises"
ySy8mcceTno,mds vai  ser q o filme death note
ySy8mcceTno,Im actually looking foward to this
ySy8mcceTno,Is logan Paul in this movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Can we just get through 2018 without something stupid happening?
ySy8mcceTno,Yasssss
ySy8mcceTno,9 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Dang
ySy8mcceTno,Why though?
ySy8mcceTno,love how this is on #4 trending and logan paul is #3 on trending
ySy8mcceTno,Watch when Jeff shows up
ySy8mcceTno,Money money money for Cindy nice 420$$$
ySy8mcceTno,This is a 5 year old fad. Sony should fire whoever came up with this idea.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow👻
ySy8mcceTno,Watch after this Sony is going to have a line of Creepypasta orgin based movies which are probably all in the same universe. That's just my 2 cents.
ySy8mcceTno,"you should also make a flappy bird movie, since youre making movies about the new trends!"
ySy8mcceTno,Uhm ok.. That came out of nowhere
ySy8mcceTno,"https://youtu.be/3MXy9e3CkCI
Also watch this video"
ySy8mcceTno,Swear to god this better be good 😑
ySy8mcceTno,I mean... I still want to see the movie but honestly this trailer kind of sucked. Felt like it was everywhere and almost just a montage of random moments of the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Yet again, Sony pictures is releasing a movie that should of came out 6 years ago when it was a trend."
ySy8mcceTno,Who wanna watch that movie
ySy8mcceTno,Latinos digan YO¡¡¡.
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly they should have made this movie in first person like cloverfield or paranormal activity.
ySy8mcceTno,It looks somewhat like stranger things 😂
ySy8mcceTno,What happened to the screen blur affect he’s supposed to cause?
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm disappointed, slender man was this tall dude in a tux without a face and weird arm things out of his back. That was not the slender man I knew from games."
ySy8mcceTno,THIS IS IT!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,See you guys in 5 years when they make a Five nights at Freddy's movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Quick question will there be an Alex in this film
ySy8mcceTno,The title announcement was itself a jumpscare.
ySy8mcceTno,Wait isn't slender man supposed to be silent?
ySy8mcceTno,"You say half the trailer isn't connected or even related with slender man. But apparently he gives you a brain virus, then some other crazy shtuff that makes you go to him."
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look very good
ySy8mcceTno,lmao i remember plaything this game all the time but the movie looks kinda lame
ySy8mcceTno,Nice trailer for a fuckin flash game but still quite cringy in some parts
ySy8mcceTno,Ah another movie that would have done great if it had been made like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Do this mean the creepypasta  fandom will rise
ySy8mcceTno,OH MY FRICKIN GOD YESSSSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,"Today's horror movie logic:

""Let's throw a bunch of disturbing images, a bleak monotone color, a ridiculous music score that has loud and sudden bangs and booms to get GASPS and OMG WTF reactions from the audience and call it a day."" Ugh, this is another one of those stupid movies that just shows DISTURBING (rolls eyes) stuff, and a jump scare mixed in every few minutes. You know the ones with the loud BANGS and something QUICK on screen, which are not scary, they're just startling and fucking annoying. 

This will be one of those films where nothing happens for 4/5 of it, as some dumb cop is like, ""DUR DUR WHAT IS HAPPENING! OMG I LOVED HER SO MUCH!"" and will go PG-13 I'm sure so the kiddies can make sure to get their scare movie teenage grope weekend in."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks horrible. Every scary movie ever.

ySy8mcceTno,Oh god a sony movie about slender man? Lamo this should be a good laugh. They should have highered Ridley Scott instead...
ySy8mcceTno,This is a rip-off from stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve que va ser buena (por el trailer)
ySy8mcceTno,"God, it was popular like, 5 years ago. You should have made the movie then. Now no one cares"
ySy8mcceTno,They should have a dead guy in the woods for Logan Paul to film
ySy8mcceTno,After about 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,Was this supposed to be scary?
ySy8mcceTno,give me $20
ySy8mcceTno,"Solo espero que no la arruinen, he esperado esta pelicula :'v"
ySy8mcceTno,sony no vas a cometer idioteces
ySy8mcceTno,"If you listen very carefully, you can hear the Creepypasta fandom starting to crawl back out from the depths."
ySy8mcceTno,Friendly reminder that these are the same people who made the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets 2
ySy8mcceTno,It's happening. After so long. It's happening.
ySy8mcceTno,"It seems alright, but I don't have high hopes for it, seeing as it's a video game movie, and every video game movie so far(apart from Wreck-it Ralph, which I don't really count) has been a disaster. But we shall see."
ySy8mcceTno,Thumbnail bait. Fuaackkkkkk
ySy8mcceTno,Sony your running out of ideas if your making a movie based off a PC game stop
ySy8mcceTno,Sony no hagas otro emoji con slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Now where's my P.T. adaptation?
ySy8mcceTno,"Please Please don't be HORRIBLE!

Please give respect to the real slenderman horror.. Show them real HORROR,show them  how brilliant marble hornets, tribe twelve and everymanhybrid is! It's about building tension not just mini heartattacks"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like the ring for me
ySy8mcceTno,This feels like the bye bye man lol
ySy8mcceTno,At the end when it said slender Man in gold letters(ish?)it should have had the Slenderman static turn on and the words disappear
ySy8mcceTno,"Woah I can’t wait for Rage Comics the Movie, Jeff the Killer, and DEFINITELY DanTDM the Movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey guys nice job not syncing with the originality of the game great job no one wants to watch this now
ySy8mcceTno,it appeared that the horror genre is becoming the next ttrend in hollywood after the superhero genre
ySy8mcceTno,Ho...ly....crap.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks realy bad
ySy8mcceTno,スレンダーマンやぁ！
ySy8mcceTno,"They'd better get the story right. Cause so far, this looks like a crappy adaptation. Slender man does NOT make tentacles come out of your eyes and mouth. That's Zalgo. He can't control your body either. I'd like to see some proof that he can though. Slenderman is known to take children. Sure, he can take teens and adults, but only when necessary. The movie should be focused around children and the Slenderman himself. Not teens and what the Slenderman does to them. Unless they are previous victims that escaped him, which is rare might I add, this movie won't be very good in my eyes and it won't follow his original stories."
ySy8mcceTno,Creo que les falto el detalle de el piano de slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Wow release the trailer so close to the trial. I guess Sony doesn’t care like usual tho
ySy8mcceTno,Thats cool when you see your one of favorite game has made out to big screen.But the lore of  the slenderman in the game is different on the movie.I mean its no big deal but kind of disappointed yet excited at the same time; but who cares just watch and judge on it after watching.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Logan Paul star as the *Dead body filmer*
ySy8mcceTno,A not see for me👎
ySy8mcceTno,I dont like the trailer because we cant see Slender Man if we see more Slender Man then it would be great
ySy8mcceTno,YES!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry, but your 8 years late on the hype train"
ySy8mcceTno,"Girl writes HIM 
Slender man : did u just assumed my gender???"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s good to see they finally released Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,"Estou muito animado para ver,sou fã do Slenderman,eu tenho a skin do Slenderman no GTA SA,tenho o jogo do Slenderman,eu já vi um filme muito ruim do Slenderman mas Assisti dkdkfkfjcj"
ySy8mcceTno,I was hoping to hear the ringing noise when they see him but whatever. Hopefully the movie is better than this..
ySy8mcceTno,"HE HAVE NEW SONG, COME ON LISTEN"
ySy8mcceTno,Stop making movies and start focusing on taking down Xbox One X
ySy8mcceTno,Parece el aro 3 jaja
ySy8mcceTno,"This is real, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok so they got Flappy Bird, emojis, and now Slender Man. Wonder what's next on hollywood's smartphone cinematic universe."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony trying cash in on the success of IT...
ySy8mcceTno,"Main issue with the trailer that lets me know the movie will be a failure: too much noise. Too many sound effects that are supposed to make it creepy and have the opposite effect. Noise isn't creepy - the silence is. Knowing there is something there, watching you, but you can't see nor hear anything. That is what Slenderman is all about. Not this. It honestly feels more like an alien invasion movie trailer, what with all the special effects."
ySy8mcceTno,wow... that was just bad
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully the movie is scarier than the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,This looks super bad / cliche but I'm still intrigued lol
ySy8mcceTno,i can never know how to express how excited i am for slendy to havr anth movie!!! yuss pls tell me this aint fanmade and is comin for realsies!!!

ySy8mcceTno,This has potential but this movie came like four years too late
ySy8mcceTno,A couple years late
ySy8mcceTno,Looks cheap
ySy8mcceTno,"Another horrible adaptation, stupid movie"
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer for this is pretty good. The visuals are beautiful (of the forest not the eye thing) and it was creepy without revealing everything. Hope the movie will be good!

ySy8mcceTno,"Jeff the killer?  >:,V
😢"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dude this looks awful, slender man has no lore anyway. This is just people killing themselves with a jumpscare at the end"
ySy8mcceTno,It's like they stole every iconic scene from Gore Verbinski's version of The Ring and stuck it in this. Even the whole vibe and style of the movie looks the same.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this 2011??
ySy8mcceTno,A little late

ySy8mcceTno,Wack.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG

ySy8mcceTno,"nahh, I don't like it."
ySy8mcceTno,I like john cena he should have played in this movie #canyouseehim I think not.

ySy8mcceTno,This reminds of it
ySy8mcceTno,The gay elephant sound was amazing.
ySy8mcceTno,The thing that makes slenderman scary is how hes so mysterious. Hes creepy just because of the way you think about him. Honestly I just hope sony doesnt go overboard on the special effects and ruin what makes slenderman scary in the first place.
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like a really bad film
ySy8mcceTno,Must see? Ehhh.
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks sony for making a movie about the creepypasta that led to the death of a twelve year old. But hey I would rather you make slender man movies than spider man. Leave that to Disney.....
ySy8mcceTno,This is the first redit/creepypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,Two cweepy 4 meh emoji. SLOONDER DUDE SCARE E HELLPP
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this movie is gonna be so bad that of course I have to see it
ySy8mcceTno,I am just hoping it will be scarier than the other Slenderman movie. Since this one seems to have a slightly bigger budget.
ySy8mcceTno,"I think makin a slender man movie is great and ive been waitin fer one for a long time but... which one is the ACTUAL story??? Was it Marble Hornets (YT series), Slender: the arrival (the game) or this?"
ySy8mcceTno,"His tall, no face, takes faces, has a lot of arms and doesnt make any noise, and never dies."
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh no, another cringy cliche horror movie.. can't wait."

ySy8mcceTno,ØØØ
ySy8mcceTno,"I think this looks like a cash grab. It's obviously pulling off of the hype of the girl who was stabbed by those dweebs who apparently took  CreepyPastas to heart. Not gonna support it,  and it's atrocious that a big movie company like this thinks it's appropriate to make."

ySy8mcceTno,"Lemme just be honest here, there are many people who know tons of lore on Slender. Sony, DO NOT MESS THIS UP, DO NOT MAKE THIS ANY MORE CLICHE THAN IT CAN BE. This trailer is pretty bad for a horror movie. Please make sure you all do more research on the lore and structure the possible plot better. This is a decently popular topic and if you pull it off then great, but if not, you will be trashed and this movie won't bring in any money."

*Sighs deeply- Googles how many minutes to midnight*"
ySy8mcceTno,These mfs at Sony about to make a silly bands movie 😂💀
ySy8mcceTno,Nah I don't think it's gonna be a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be awful
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"Not gonna lie, they did the right thing trying to make Slender Man's appearance highly anticipated by waiting to show him towards the end of the trailer but the way he was presented was meh.

Could have been so much more powerful and no one is gonna jump from that."
ySy8mcceTno,Reminds me of Stranger Things
ySy8mcceTno,Did I just watched the whole movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I'd rather have an Unfriended Remake
ySy8mcceTno,amateurish. what a shame.
ySy8mcceTno,"So the story revolves around a man
who happens to be slender
and blends in the trees?
meh i got nothing"
ySy8mcceTno,Nahhh
ySy8mcceTno,"When they put a space between it, you know it’s gonna be bad"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Slender man 2 will be better. 😂😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"My Childhood dreams have come true, FINALLY!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Most likely not going to be as good as Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,Another one of those Monster Movies where the monster is a blurry shadow
ySy8mcceTno,This would've been cool like..5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Sure they can make this, but they won’t even look at the SCP files"
ySy8mcceTno,Popular 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,I’m just glad Sony got on the slender train while it was full speed
ySy8mcceTno,I’m excited! Even if it’s really stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,Can we please leave slender man in 2013-4
ySy8mcceTno,I don't get it
ySy8mcceTno,"First glance I thought the title says Spider Man, and I was like WTF!?"
ySy8mcceTno,Spoiler at the end... NICE
ySy8mcceTno,HOW ABOUT NO
ySy8mcceTno,"HYPED
I NEEEEEED IT"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks stupid...
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how much the dlc will be
ySy8mcceTno,I'll only watch this if they turn it into a creepypasta cinematic universe with the SCP foundation showing up to be shady af.
ySy8mcceTno,This is Monstrosity... and Scary! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! 😱
ySy8mcceTno,I can tell it's bad because it's based off a video game and they didn't add the static sound effect
ySy8mcceTno,It seems like it has no plot
ySy8mcceTno,Here's a good concept: creepy pasta Cinematic universe. If this movie does well why not do Jeff the killer than ticci toby and so on. It would be cool to see them all on the big screen
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait for the roblox movie tho
ySy8mcceTno,It’s a game you know and they making a movie of terror
ySy8mcceTno,Aylabet
ySy8mcceTno,h
ySy8mcceTno,*YO MY HEART JUMPED WHEN I SAW THE TITLE NOT THE VIDEO!!*
ySy8mcceTno,IVE WAITED SO LONG
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the trailer ended like 4 times
ySy8mcceTno,Lame as F
ySy8mcceTno,I WAITED FOR THIS SO LONG
ySy8mcceTno,"Luce muy mala, no parece que vaya a seguir la historia de Slenderman... Sólo espero que no decepcionen a su publico.. Yo tengo una idea de lo que podrían hacer, como que la chica al enloquecer quede atrapada en el bosque y sea quien nos escribe las notas o los mensajes en la casa, para advertir al resto de personas que deben irse.
 No se dice mucho, pero el las cosas raras al final, y el ojo siendo perforado, dan a entender que... o van a irse por las ramas y arruinar todo, o van a mencionar el experimento 84-B... espero que mi pensamiento se haga realidad y ella sea quien escribe las notas en su ""Locura""... Seguramente este comentario pase desapercibido, pero... pasa con muchos otros"
ySy8mcceTno,"if youre gonna release this now, bad idea..shoulda released it in like 2012 - 2014"
ySy8mcceTno,1:33 thats normal this days..
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay. This movie will be bad because:
1. It's Sony
2. It's about 8 years too late
3. The trailer looks awful..."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow they're making a movie on a character that runs away if seen I wonder if they will make a movie called dad based as a sequel
ySy8mcceTno,Markiplier's arch nemesis returns
ySy8mcceTno,Movies made out of game ideas have always been a disaster. I doubt that this one will break the rule.
ySy8mcceTno,My classmates are gonna freak the hell out. since Slenderman is dead like irrelevant dead this movie will bring his legend or creepypasta or myth back up
ySy8mcceTno,And those 2 girls who murdered a girl for slendernan will never see it HAHAHAHAHA.
ySy8mcceTno,"This game came out about six years ago now,,,, why make a movie now? And why a shitty one at that?"
ySy8mcceTno,Part one of the creepy pasta universe next movie is Jeff the killer and the last one will be some crapy pasta that at 12 year old wrote
ySy8mcceTno,oh my god.
ySy8mcceTno,pass
ySy8mcceTno,#fearthefaclessmonster
ySy8mcceTno,they gone get it wrong watch this
ySy8mcceTno,still waiting for the Minecraft movie
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like little bits of every horror movie ever randomly cut together.... Also, I have a headache now."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,So...no proxies or finding the pages???
ySy8mcceTno,"Possible locations for the movie:
Suicide forest (copyright Logan Paul)
Forest from original slender game"
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like garbage to be honest, but from the like to dislike ratio I assume people liked it, so idk"
ySy8mcceTno,a slender man movie in 2018 was this necessary
ySy8mcceTno,will they make a movie about the russian sleep experiment?
ySy8mcceTno,"to be honest the Marble Hornets' videos used to give me nightmares, but this is getting ridiculous"
ySy8mcceTno,"just let the poor guy rest, it's been 9 years since 2009"
ySy8mcceTno,Huh... I was right.
ySy8mcceTno,this would've been more relevant if it came out in the 2007-2008 era but hey. what're ya gonna do?
ySy8mcceTno,this looks pure scary
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it follows the creepypasta. That girl from the end must be Kate then becomes the stalker in the mines.
ySy8mcceTno,"Club Penguin: The Movie, coming to theaters in 2021"
ySy8mcceTno,"WE DONT NEED A SLENDER MAN FILM!


We need dat Roblox"
ySy8mcceTno,If they make a “Creepypasta cinematic universe” I will have no faith in the horror genre.
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s made by Sony, so of course it’s gonna suck."
ySy8mcceTno,I want the roblox movie don’t you
ySy8mcceTno,Nossa nada haver esse filme
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks for telling me to watch the trailer during the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,"And with that, my childhood nightmare becomes a reality #fml"
ySy8mcceTno,"STRIKING WHILE THE IRON IS COLDER THAN THE ARCTIC!!!

You should do a POGS movie next!"
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t suck and be rated R cuz PG13 horror movies almost always suck
ySy8mcceTno,Garbage trailer. I hope whoever made it gets fired.
ySy8mcceTno,In 2025 they'll make a Call of Duty movie
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing at all like the Slender Man we all know and love. Why the hell are they possessed and why isn’t it a straightforward story with all the Slender Man lore? Completely filled with horror clichés and not expecting anything out of this
ySy8mcceTno,What's next sonic or jeff
ySy8mcceTno,When you try to make a movie out of a horror game. Not going to work
ySy8mcceTno,"This is based on a 2012 creepypasta that some teen made, and now it's a movie. 


Welp, time to binge."
ySy8mcceTno,I think my right ear drum is damaged after those high pitch noises :P
ySy8mcceTno,This is not advertiser friendly
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!
ySy8mcceTno,This has got to be one of the worst trailers I've seen in a long time.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY !!!!!!😆😆😆
ySy8mcceTno,My brother is obsessed with Slender. Wait till I tell him :)
ySy8mcceTno,Is this fake
ySy8mcceTno,...
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn't this supposed to be out in 2017?
ySy8mcceTno,You know a movie is going to suck when even the trailer is s**t.
ySy8mcceTno,This is not scary
ySy8mcceTno,Who thinks this is like stranger things.
ySy8mcceTno,Impressive stuff for Nvidia Shadowplay 😉
ySy8mcceTno,He's gonna be revealed as an alien
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the emoji movie makes appearance in this
ySy8mcceTno,Intriguing... But it's Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,All y'all commenting on Logan in a ad our sad
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow is truely dangerous
God dammit 🎬💀🎈"
ySy8mcceTno,im giving it a chance
ySy8mcceTno,SPOILER ALERT* the person who is playing slenderman is Logan Paul and the movie takes place in suicide forest . Logan was just giving us behind the scenes in his vlog 😋
ySy8mcceTno,We must find all seven notes
ySy8mcceTno,Gimme 20 dollars. Gimme 20 dollars.
ySy8mcceTno,Why isn’t this #1 on trending?
ySy8mcceTno,why create this cancer
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so crap...
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like crap
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 16 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,first 5 seconds:  *oh f*** *no*
ySy8mcceTno,Good trailer but slender man is like 2012
ySy8mcceTno,They're seriously doing this year's after the hype died down for slender?
ySy8mcceTno,next lets make a Tetris movie! so hip and relevant
ySy8mcceTno,So who’s gonna alert Markiplier about this?
ySy8mcceTno,"We already have one slender man movie, do we really need another?
Next thing ya know, people are going to be telling me that A five nights at freddys movie is coming out............................................."
ySy8mcceTno,"What relevant horror game should we make a movie about in 2018? This... well, I mean, it’s a game..."
ySy8mcceTno,"WE WANT SCP, WE WANT SCP"
ySy8mcceTno,#sonyissteppingtheregameup
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Slender Man in the trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,"But I just need one thing from the movie: keep the lore the same. Electronic interference when he comes, the operators symbol, etc."
ySy8mcceTno,"But.... But why ""Slender Man"" and not ""Slenderman?"" Does this bug anyone else? No? Ok fine."
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like it has potential but it also just looks like a crappy horror movie that only uses cheap jump scares and disturbing imagery to scare the audience instead of tension and atmosphere building.
ySy8mcceTno,"I suppose I'm not surprised, but still. Come on. 

Although... If it goes down a more psychological route than a paranormal one and kept the viewer questioning the characters perceptions of reality. It might actually be worth a watch."
ySy8mcceTno,When everyone in the comments is talking about how they'll never sleep again and then you aren't even scared because you're in the creepypasta fandom and have seen worse
ySy8mcceTno,Spooky
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't know that it was possible to film a movie using a pissjug
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for this movie a long time waiting since I was 9 now I’m 11 turning 12 in February #2long
ySy8mcceTno,Pretty niche market for a movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Didnt the slender hype die 4 years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,This made me crave those $1 Burger King breakfast burritos. 😍 Who’s with me!!? Let’s gooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,No lo vi muy bien lo del Slenderman no lo mostraron tanto :c
ySy8mcceTno,"The most boring trailer ever. If you are scared, you are incredibly dumb."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna be a bad one.
ySy8mcceTno,That marker sound is ughhh!
ySy8mcceTno,I’m guessing the guys from marble hornets aren’t working on this one.
ySy8mcceTno,Perfect timing for a forest video
ySy8mcceTno,Is this logan paul's new vlog?
ySy8mcceTno,At least it isn’t some cliche found footage film :/
ySy8mcceTno,I'd rather watch the original YouTube videos. All a money scam.
ySy8mcceTno,Y ESSSSZSSS
ySy8mcceTno,Finally the movie that I have been waiting for thank you Sony
ySy8mcceTno,The Bye Bye Man 2?
ySy8mcceTno,"""People just dont dissapear"" um clearly your daughter just did"
ySy8mcceTno,Cp fans would love this (im a cp fan)😆 (cp means creepy pasta
ySy8mcceTno,Who else reading them comments?
ySy8mcceTno,ughh. I knew it was only a matter of time. Iv'e seen fan films shot better than this with better acting. The entertainment industry must be straight up out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,https://akira-2019.myshopify.com/
ySy8mcceTno,It looks awful VERY awful
ySy8mcceTno,"This seems like it might actually be kinda scary . very creepy trailer. looks can be deceiving , but this might actually be one of the best horror movies in years ."
ySy8mcceTno,Holy
ySy8mcceTno,The amazing slender man
ySy8mcceTno,The timing of this trailer and the Logan Paul stuff is ridiculous.
ySy8mcceTno,Eu acho que o filme não tera a essência do Slender ele mal aparece no trailer e ele sequestra crianças onde tá as crianças não sei
ySy8mcceTno,is this legit
ySy8mcceTno,a bit late...
ySy8mcceTno,I need to watch this
ySy8mcceTno,The second we go into 2018 we're back into 2012
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when this was just a game with Markeplier and Pewdiepie...
ySy8mcceTno,This is obviously going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,Well that was shitty
ySy8mcceTno,There are already 2 slender movies called slender and always watching a marble hornets story in not lying look it up
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm watching this opening night, my biggest fear as a 6 year old was Slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,"AAA games are destroying the gaming industry. So far low budget games are having the biggest impact and influence, Cuphead is a good example of this."

ySy8mcceTno,"great idea sony. Make a movie about a game that hasnt been popular for 8 years, sure."
ySy8mcceTno,All i think of is pewdiepie
ySy8mcceTno,kust saying rhis seem fan made.
ySy8mcceTno,Crooked man is Scarier
ySy8mcceTno,#blessed
ySy8mcceTno,this actually looks like it could be a great horror film. they keep slenderman in the shadows not showing him up close. and when they do show him upclose which is once in this trailer his face is blocked by something or head sense hes got know face. it doesnt reveal to much about the story except the basics and it looks like it has a good way of shooting the scenes. this could be a pretty good film.

ySy8mcceTno,"5 years late, Sony. Sorry."
ySy8mcceTno,Was Slender man first or Minecraft enderman? Because one copied the other.
ySy8mcceTno,A trailer about a Slenderman movie that only has maybe 2% to actually do with slendy while the rest is cliche' scare images. They had better be releasing a better trailer soon.

When I was 4 years old, some of my neighborhood friends got ahold of their father's garden knife, and while I was riding my tricycle, they came up behind me and stabbed me in the back.  The knife was dull, so not much damage was done, but I was told later that my mom was pregnant at the time and the stress of all that caused her to mis-carry.  She forgave those kids, and taught me to think and do the same.  Morgan wasn't thinking right - have some mercy on her.  Annisa?..  She sold-out Morgan to get a better outcome for herself!  I don't think about her."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so corny
ySy8mcceTno,Even this slenderman guy has more respect for the corpses than Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Omg iw like longed for a slender man movie and now here it is! :D im way to happy now!
ySy8mcceTno,I so desperately want this to be good
ySy8mcceTno,"DOES ANYONE NOTICE THAT THIS MOVIE COPIES DIRECTLY SCENES FROM THE RING BUT IN A REALLY CHEESY WAY? I have always liked Slender Man, but I don't like the direction this movie is going, it looks like it's going to destroy the idea of him. Too much blood and insects are not what Slender Man is."
ySy8mcceTno,Hold this L sony.
ySy8mcceTno,didnt know slender man was a virus.
ySy8mcceTno,100% This movie is gonna be a huge disappointment.
ySy8mcceTno,why to go when it has the most hype sony
ySy8mcceTno,"2018: SlenderMan Movie
2019: Minecraft Movie

La iré a ver con gusto a la peli."
ySy8mcceTno,Omg i can belive it this slenderman.IS THE FIRST CREEPYPASTA TEAM I AM JUST SO EXITED TO WATCH IT YASSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,I hope that they use things from the game like the notes to make it more suspenseful when the person reads it
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like an indie film student short horror montage trying to show how edgy they are.
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer movie would be fucking awesome!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks like a typical garbage modern horror movie... why waste a good idea like Slender ffs ? whatever... I guess I'm gonna try and watch it, not raising my hopes tho'"
ySy8mcceTno,Türk varmı gardaşlar
ySy8mcceTno,They've already fucked him up. Sony please just stick to audio and playstation products.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a cheap student film with no story.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m wait for a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Jenna marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,weak
ySy8mcceTno,Why?

ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know if I'm missing something or not, but for a Slenderman movie, there sure isn't a lot OF the Slenderman..."
ySy8mcceTno,What if they made a jeff the killer movie in 2020?
ySy8mcceTno,spoiler alert! Logan Paul dies at suicide forest
ySy8mcceTno,Oof it looks like we're off to a bad start 2018 can do better than this...
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow can't wait to see this movie which looks like it has such strong characters and plot, probably gunna win an oscar for best direction"

ySy8mcceTno,"Director: Logan Paul
Slender Man: Dead man hanging in the wood"
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late for this film
ySy8mcceTno,Making a movie based off of a PC game is a stupid thing to do. No wonder Sony is running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t know what about the flashing imagery annoys me so much, it’s like they tried copying how The Ring did it and failed so hard."

ySy8mcceTno,Someone is finally making a Slender Man movie?!

ySy8mcceTno,"Seriously, let a franchise die in peace"
ySy8mcceTno,Lame 👎🏼
ySy8mcceTno,How can you make a comedy movie without Chris Tucker?

ySy8mcceTno,1:26 careful buddy logan paul might laugh at your dead body
ySy8mcceTno,is there really any slender man in this though
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting for this since I saw a leak of the title screen for this movie

ySy8mcceTno,"The only creepypasta movie I’d be semi interested in is a full Jeff The killer movie but it should only be one good movie not setup for terrible sequels. Think of it, 2 hour feature with the origin story, little killing spree along with Jane The Killer origin then end it with a showdown between the two"
ySy8mcceTno,wow .... im so excited ... I cant wait not to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Featuring: Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Qué mal que Sony se aproveche de la idea de alguien más
ySy8mcceTno,It looks extremely boring
ySy8mcceTno,"This thing was half dead, and now is going back to life in a totally non sense movie? "
ySy8mcceTno,So whos the guy with flashlight back from 6 yrs ago?
ySy8mcceTno,About 7 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Ive been waiting for this for a long time finaly thank god
ySy8mcceTno,Why couldn't it be called slender women....or would that be too insensitive?
ySy8mcceTno,"So glad to finally see an official movie for what I still think is a great horror concept! I'd been talking off and on for a couple years how I wanted a movie based on the mythos/creepypastas and now i finally get it! Here's hoping its a good one!

Also guys please for the love of god, please quit with the Logan Paul memes. Its been less than a week and its already dead"
ySy8mcceTno,"I ain't gonna lie

ySy8mcceTno,Anybody agrees that its not scary?
ySy8mcceTno,where my Amnesia movie at Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Someone had been using the internet explorer :o so late!!

ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,heyaaa i m Logan Paul and today we are gonna catch Slender Man kids and kill him and then vlog his face see ya

ySy8mcceTno,Oh that's great sony !! Here.. have some Jello..
ySy8mcceTno,Can Sony finally stop making movies. If they produces movies on their own its mostly utter trash.
ySy8mcceTno,I fucking hate this surround sound headphones
ySy8mcceTno,ah please don't ruin Creepypasta for me this better be a good movie  please I trust you on this!
ySy8mcceTno,"Aww, I wish I had done the music for this. Still, really looking forward to it!"
ySy8mcceTno,There better not be someone being hanging from a tree scene cuz Logan Paul will film it ._.
ySy8mcceTno,From Director Logan Paul

ySy8mcceTno,"The sequel is Logan Paul going into the forest to find the victims of Slenderman but don't worry, the sequal of the sequal is a 1 hour 52 min apology movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Pretty cool but not sure a cool movie
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for the pong movie now
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets - with a budget of approx. 5$  - is still better than all of these shitty slenderman movies.
ySy8mcceTno,scary soundboard man working overtime in this one... cut him a check for mashing every button on the board.
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta fans love it ❤
ySy8mcceTno,"A slender man movie could be great honestly, trailer sucked tho"

ySy8mcceTno,I think Logan find one of the dead body
ySy8mcceTno,Based off an Internet Meme... Wow Sony....
ySy8mcceTno,I wish they give us jeff the killer movie?who agrees with me
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey everybody, gather round the campfire. I’d like to tell y’all a story I like to call “The Folly of Logan Paul- the Life Story”. Ok that was it."
ySy8mcceTno,"if this was made into a show instead of a movie, i would totally watch it"
ySy8mcceTno,I miss when Slenderman wasnt normie garbage..
ySy8mcceTno,"FINALLY !!! WOHOOO
i'm not a fan of creepypasta, but slenderman tho....
Hopefully it'll be as good as I expected"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yönetmen:

Slender Man REİS"
ySy8mcceTno,"This really does not look good. Not only was over half the trailer unrelated to slender man, but he looks completely different. It’s good to change things up for a movie, but you’ve made it loose all its original charm. Like, honestly, I’d rather see a Marble Hornets remake. Hell, I’d rather watch Marble Hornets rather than this. I can guarantee you this movie will not be as good as Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,2spooky
ySy8mcceTno,Really.
ySy8mcceTno,"...


6/5"
ySy8mcceTno,I predict 2018 to be a year of Creepypasta adaption + a few Marvel movies. Hollywood has no originality.
ySy8mcceTno,2018 trailers already off with a bad start.
ySy8mcceTno,It was a great decision to watch this at midnight in a dark room when I live by myself
ySy8mcceTno,Thy couldn't come up with original content (tm) so they just put in videos of disgusting/creepy stuff. Like WTF do maggots and eye surgery have to do with the motherfucking slenderman? The writers of this movie probably didn't even read the original creepypasta... -_-
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear Sony, it is only trending because people got hyped and thought you did a good job. But you didnt."
ySy8mcceTno,When things can't get any worse...
ySy8mcceTno,"How many of you bet that they'll make this like Rings. All stupid and mostly a comedy movie. Ugh man, I feel like crying for hyping myself up and thinking that a company finally made a real scary movie about him. I'm done."
ySy8mcceTno,he’s supposed to be silent.. that’s the creepy thing about him..
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony is on to something...
CREEPYPASTA CINEMATIC UNIVERSE!"
ySy8mcceTno,This look cliche af. I guess we might have another Bye Bye Man but this one is a creepypasta this time
ySy8mcceTno,"I think slenderman works better as a tale. Him being in a movie is probably not going to work out. I used to be terrified of him cause of how easily and how hauntingly he blended into things in the art of him and stuff, I don't think they'll catch that in this movie. In the scene that shows slenderman he's so obviously there, he seems too small."
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been a cool movie to see like 5 years ago when this was actually poppin off. But a movie in 2018? Jesus christ
ySy8mcceTno,"This could end up being an early hit for 2018. As someone who enjoys creepypasta in general there's room to tell more stories, like how channel Zero has adapted Candle Cove and No End House, my two favorite creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,"A lot of people will be expecting a quality accurate movie. Hopefully it's not comparable to the Death Note adaptation, in that they really let down true fans."
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie....based on a creepy pasta. Still Infinitely more creative than Emoji movie ever will be and isn't another boring/tiresome remake or sequel. So at least there's that. This could be sweet if they ACTUALLY pull it off, but I won't hold my breath"
ySy8mcceTno,LOL
ySy8mcceTno,He'll no
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a Slender Man movie. I love creepypasta 😂❤
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul will like this film
ySy8mcceTno,I wish my kid can believe Slender man and IT ain't real like Santa Claus....then here comes the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,We already have a movie... it’s called marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Why does it always have to be a girl?
ySy8mcceTno,This is reaaaally bottom of the barrel stuff.
ySy8mcceTno,Dead game
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay so I was hyped and now I'm like wtf...please don't. Guys I've always wanted a slenderman movie. A good original one. If no one can do it, I will. Btw if you have wattpad, follow me: @melvinyepez99...Im releasing the story through there first. I'm still writing it btw. It'll be scarier than this for sure bruh"
ySy8mcceTno,"Huh




AT LEAST IT CANT BE AS BAD AS THE EMOJI MOVIE"
ySy8mcceTno,"The little girl went missing? if its kate who went missing she wasn't a little girl when that happened,  this better have masky and Charlie in it or I'm out"
ySy8mcceTno,Pls get Jeff the killer next
ySy8mcceTno,I know ive seen people do this before and i thought they were pathetic but i gotta  start from somewhere... could you look at some of my covers in my channel? Anyone? Please give me a chance thank you!

ySy8mcceTno,"Saw the forest, quicky thought of Logan Paul"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks as generic as it can get. I'm sure it will be as good as Friend Request was last year.
ySy8mcceTno,Roblox plz
ySy8mcceTno,To be honest I am confused and lost on what the hell is happening in this movie. I mean I only seen a shadow of slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,"lame. slender man was scary bc of the lack of screen time. the rng and the not constant interaction. you need to set a false sense of security then shatter it otherwise if you're just gonna go classic horror movie style of incoming imminent doom, its not rly slender. if the girl it was haunting was first

> initially concerned
> short encounter 
> false resolution, relief then sense of security
> normal activity
> get fucked slender's back

= great slender movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Although this has a fair chance of turning out garbage, I can't help but be super excited for this movie! 😁"
ySy8mcceTno,A girl got stabbed 19 times! Why'd they have to make a movie about this character???
ySy8mcceTno,My god this looks so bad.

ySy8mcceTno,"Hey is Logan Paul gonna be in it? *GET IT BECAUSE HE FOUND A DEAD BODY IN THE FOREST?!?!?!?* smh y'all really tryna get likes off of something like that. On an unrelated note, this looks like it's trying to be another ""Ring"" with all the twitchy stuff and gross imagery."
ySy8mcceTno,After the incident with the 2 girls trying to lure the girl into the woods and sacrafice her because slenderman told them too makes me cared of watching it. Not only that but how it will affect viewers. Im still going to watch it though just...please remember its not real

ySy8mcceTno,1:20 Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Kids might lure eachother into the forest though!
ySy8mcceTno,I'm skeptical
ySy8mcceTno,looks good to me
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this would be the story of the 13 year old girls that murdered another girl over this...I wonder if Sony knows that
ySy8mcceTno,Duck Tales Revamped looks good..
ySy8mcceTno,you’re seriously going to make a movie about a fictional being that made 2 girls almost kill another girl as a sacrifice to him??? i get its a gold mine of horror techniques but come on... imagine the families pain knowing that people are going to make money off of something like this...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks worse then the boy
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good... But if it's rated PG-teeny horror it's gonna suck.
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao this comment section is crawling with Logan Paul jokes😂

Marble Hornets was a decent watch and the original post on the something awful forums was pretty cool but the worst thing to do to these types of horror is make them mainstream, load it with CGI and add in dumb horror cliches, but I guess the kids who praised the game for being a good horror game even though it was a jump scare simulator will still watch and praise the movie."

ySy8mcceTno,Didnt those girls that stabbed thier friend get found competent to stand trial.
ySy8mcceTno,now they need a jeff the killer movie and maybe a cinematic universe just cause
ySy8mcceTno,After all the fan made trailers finally there's a real trailer of it
ySy8mcceTno,this trailer is a total mess!
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul memes about suicide have arisen from hell.
ySy8mcceTno,LITERALLY LIKE 6 YEARS TOO LATE AS IF SONY
ySy8mcceTno,You wanna know what the true problem I could see this movie making would be?
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim?
ySy8mcceTno,En mi calendario dice 2018
ySy8mcceTno,There is already a Slender Man movie. It's called Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,"I read the description for the movie back in 2015. It said ""a tall pale man starts an art gallery in the woods"""
ySy8mcceTno,"For some reason I thought the title said Spider Man, but cLeArLy it isn’t.







And I was terrified"
ySy8mcceTno,0:01 WTF is that circle thing
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY-
ySy8mcceTno,Sony don't have ideas? Go Back to the Past
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone say...  FORCED MONEYGRAB?
ySy8mcceTno,A little late
ySy8mcceTno,"As a person who watches alot of TribeTwelve and EverymanHYBRID, and of course, Marble hornets  . I Really hope this can live up to my hopes."
ySy8mcceTno,"CAN PEOPLE STOP WITH THE LOGAN PAUL JOKES, I KNOW WHAT HE DID, BUT SEEING LIKE 15 COMMENTS ABOUT IT IN THIS TRAILER, IS STARTING TO BUGGED ME, AND NO I'M NOT DEFENDING HIM, BUT PEOPLE, STOP!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,I wish they into introduced  the characters more
ySy8mcceTno,"yES 

I need to beg my mom to see this"
ySy8mcceTno,When is it coming I’m going to love it 😍
ySy8mcceTno,what is it with all these fucking logan paul jokes? STOP IT! IT'S WHAT HE WANTS!!!
ySy8mcceTno,You're years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,Please don't ruin slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"This is actually..






A disappointment.. I expected more out of Sony.."
ySy8mcceTno,I have high hopes but low expectations. Slender is the OG jumpscare.
ySy8mcceTno,I think this film gonna be more unconfortable than scary to see...
ySy8mcceTno,lol slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres muy fucking FNaF movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"So this movie is going to be ""The Ring"". yawn."
ySy8mcceTno,Its real?
ySy8mcceTno,😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,"i can already tell they overdid his design and messed up what was scary about him (a smooth, pale, featureless face) he looks too dirty. this had horrible cgi and what's with the all the hair? i don't remember that being any part of the mythology smh it looks like rings"
ySy8mcceTno,"What the hell? What year is this, 2012?"
ySy8mcceTno,Va a ser igual que la de death note para Netflix jajajajja
ySy8mcceTno,Finally someone thought of this
ySy8mcceTno,The ring ?
ySy8mcceTno,"I would say to just stop and not even make this a movie, buttttt they’ve already spent money making this so good luck I guess! 🙃"
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 indeed has a gay elephant noise! bakura is so happy ^_^
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly looks like just another cliched, run-of-the-mill horror film that will most likely stray away from the original source material. But then again, look at the live action Smurf movies."
ySy8mcceTno,Omfgggggggg yessssss
ySy8mcceTno,Warning if u are in the LOGANG!!!! don’t keep scrolling
ySy8mcceTno,????? This trailer suck?????
ySy8mcceTno,Logan pall trees har har
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,"Tarde...como 10 años tarde >:""v"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like a Mile Of Cock but, I bet I'll still go see it"
ySy8mcceTno,I Didn't See Much Of Slender Man And Another Bummer Is That I Didn't See Logan Paul Either XD
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't like the trailer it was too dry, sorry."
ySy8mcceTno,Azopotamadre :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Esto va a ser o muy bueno, o muy malo"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this like 7 years to late?
ySy8mcceTno,"It's almost 2 o'clock in the morning and there's a new trailer for Slender Man.  Yeah, nothing could possibly go wrong by clicking on it now.  First five seconds of the video pops up without logos or anything, just black and white footage of an eye being stabbed with a needle.  Nightmares, you say?  Ha!  I wish.  Odds are I'll never sleep again.  Thanks, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are 5 years late sorry
ySy8mcceTno,"Minecraft the movie will be out in 2025, they are going to film it in 144p"
ySy8mcceTno,Please tell me this is just a super early April Fools joke.
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul you could of told us that you were doing a sneak peak to slender man when filming the forest
ySy8mcceTno,I’ll only watch this movie if the nigga fights Godzilla in the after credits scene.
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the start of the creepypasta cinematic universe. Just wait...
ySy8mcceTno,"Came here to see the debut of the gay elephant, was not disappointed."
ySy8mcceTno,Yo just make an outlast movie would be so much better
ySy8mcceTno,Sony fucked up ghostbusters than emojis and now slender man what’s next Barbie and Minecraft
ySy8mcceTno,I thought 'twas Spiderman and it's Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,GRAPHICS LOOKS REAL 😯
ySy8mcceTno,Oh snap
ySy8mcceTno,"after 9 years in development, we hope it's been worth the wait."
ySy8mcceTno,Feminist slender man ????
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe if Sony didn't make this I'd have faith in it
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this seriously necessary? The whole Slender Man craze has completely died out a few years back. Why make a theatrical Slender Man movie now, of all times? Let alone one after giving us The Emoji Movie last summer? Such a random thing to have greenlit, and that’s saying something considering the aforementioned Emoji Movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Inb4 Creepy pasta cinematic universe with the shady government agency being SCP
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is that?
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated the film of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,IT SHOULD BE BASED OFF THE SLENDER ARRIVAL STORY CHARLIE THE ORIGIN OF HOW SLENDER CAME TO BE AND THE THREE ADULT FRIENDS WHO KEEP SEEING THIS. CREATURE Kate lives in a house in the middle in the woods and they all think its fake
ySy8mcceTno,I’m going to be so fucking disappointed if this has nothing to do with Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,"if Sony fucks this up there is gonna be a lawsuit 



A HUGE fucking lawsuit"
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't make any sense.
ySy8mcceTno,Don't mess it up don't mess it up don't mess it up please don't mess it up
ySy8mcceTno,Welp
ySy8mcceTno,"*Alright, y'all. Here are the comments summed up* People would like Harambe Movie, Sony Sucks at making movies, The creator of the game should be paid, FNAF movie?, SLENDERMAN is acutally LOGAN PAUL for watching dead people. Spams links to watch this movie, lol. They wait too late to make this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dopey.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow first transformer, than TMNT, now fucking Slender Man!? What's next a FNAF movie?🤔😂😂"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about fucking time
ySy8mcceTno,He sure is slender
ySy8mcceTno,Ya puedo morir en paz😫
ySy8mcceTno,Cuando va a sailir para mexico
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul = YouTube career OVER'!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, you've got to admit. This is WAY better than the emoji movie."
ySy8mcceTno,next herobrine
ySy8mcceTno,Too many spoilers in the trailer. Shame on the producers. I’m going to pirate it instead of see it in theatres because of the poor trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,just a enderman wildin
ySy8mcceTno,Should have made a Slender Man movie about the girls who killed in its name.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ceo of Sony : ""it's hip and cool to make a movie from a trend that died years ago, we win the whole hipster audience!!"""

(Guarden este comentario)"
ySy8mcceTno,SHUT UP NO WAY.
ySy8mcceTno,Yeaaah this is probably gonna fail
ySy8mcceTno,Um... Sony you're 5-7 years too late to be making this movie. If you want to make a scary movie make Emoji Movie 2 or a Fidget spinner movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a cheap movie
ySy8mcceTno,"1:23 to hear the gay elephant noise :,3"
ySy8mcceTno,boo 😈
ySy8mcceTno,Half of this trailer showed kids killing them selfs then you only have slenderman at the end
ySy8mcceTno,can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,That trailer told me nothing bout the movie
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/9uGWqR0i9cQ
ySy8mcceTno,You do realize slendernan's a meme at this point
ySy8mcceTno,"Im gonna be kinda sceptical about this.. o3o 
But at the same time.. Im interested."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real life anymore??????
ySy8mcceTno,How many clichés did you spot?
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't look half bad
ySy8mcceTno,I came for the gay elephant noise.
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn't this fantasy making kids go crazy & try to murder someone ?
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone tell Sony it’s not 2012 anymore. Thanks.
ySy8mcceTno,this woulda been cool like 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,I was waiting for this during years!
ySy8mcceTno,When  i seen this i was sure that people will say that this is a movie made by Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,I CAN'T WAIT
ySy8mcceTno,Si esto es real podría valer una fortuna ;v
ySy8mcceTno,couldn't care less
ySy8mcceTno,Dead meme: the awakening
ySy8mcceTno,MY 4TH GRADE CHILD HOOD DREAM WISH IT COULDVE BEEN MADE BY WARNER BROS THOUGH CAUSE SONY SUCKS
ySy8mcceTno,Im sorry but for real...some people just need to stfu about logan paul..he said sorry...get over it🙄
ySy8mcceTno,Up next: The Russian Sleep Experiment.
ySy8mcceTno,"Listen, for real creepypasta fans, Slenderman, Jeff, Jane etc will always live on. Slenderman never died, his Legend will always live on. For life and eternity!"
ySy8mcceTno,The hole plot of this movie: Logan is slender and he's doing it for the views in suicide forest as he records the dead bodies. Slenderman 2018
ySy8mcceTno,6 yrs later now they wanna come up w a Slender Movie smh 😭😂
ySy8mcceTno,This is just like the slender man killing when to 2 12 year olds stabbed their friend
ySy8mcceTno,looks weak
ySy8mcceTno,Im just one of those people who will at least give it a chance before  commenting its bad
ySy8mcceTno,i love poniesssssssassss!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Hol up
ySy8mcceTno,My 10yr old self is shaking in his boots
ySy8mcceTno,Did slender hit yourhfueudud with  you all day long but and I
ySy8mcceTno,Awwww I was hoping for some Blair Witch type of movie like they lost and slender is out for them. This movie gonna flop I can fell it
ySy8mcceTno,Alv neerfen a slender man :v
ySy8mcceTno,"I already don’t like it, and Slender Man is an awesome character to make a horror movie with. Dis gehy💁🏽‍♀️"
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda wish I was still in the fandom 😕
ySy8mcceTno,"For all the real creepy pasty knowers i think we all hope to get some proxy action 
( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)"
ySy8mcceTno,"I really hope this doesn't suck as much as it probably will...
Poor Slendy. :/"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie just like a normal shaye saint john videos
ySy8mcceTno,Will it be taking place in the suicide forest starring Logan Paul?
ySy8mcceTno,going to watch this with stepsister so we can laugh at how garbage it's gonna be 👌👌
ySy8mcceTno,"I should be turned away from this I imagine, as I’m a little older then the 13-15 year old demographic that adores slender man. But it still seems rather interesting. I mean, I liked slender man a lot once and I even believed he was real for a time. The trailer looked really good, and the muted colors makes it even better. This is a movie I’d like to go and see."
ySy8mcceTno,I love it I'm a fan of creepy pasta and I love slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Wow. Going for a decade old internet meme for your movie themes. Scrapping the bottom of the barrel much?
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't want to be that fan, but ever since I was younger I wanted Markiplier to be in any movie they decided to make of slenderman. Mega oof"
ySy8mcceTno,The amount of logan paul references in the comments is amazing
ySy8mcceTno,This remind me the advertising for  Mr Plow from The Simpsons
ySy8mcceTno,10 years late lol
ySy8mcceTno,Its not even scary to me...Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucci gang Gucgi gang...
ySy8mcceTno,just another B movie
ySy8mcceTno,Its 3am ._.
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh Sony, you just never learn, do you?"
ySy8mcceTno,Did Logan Paul write this?
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,Probably shouldn't warch this at 2 in the morning just before I go to sleep but screw it curiosity kills the cat as they say.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally i've been waiting for this for a long time
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf slender man died 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"A slenderman movie, now were talking"
ySy8mcceTno,"Next after this movie is the fidget spinner movie, can't fucking wait"
ySy8mcceTno,Do the camera men from Logan Paul's video appear?
ySy8mcceTno,this doesn’t feel like a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, 2018 is going on a great start........On scaring me🤔"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks trash
ySy8mcceTno,it's Sony so I'm sure they will ruin it.
ySy8mcceTno,Thinn boi the movi
ySy8mcceTno,A girl already got stabbed like 12 times because of slender man legends what will happen now? who knows
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope it does not turn bad like the emoji movie even tho i did not seen it but slender man was the most scariest game to my childhood when i was 7 now im 15
ySy8mcceTno,This looks very unscary and stupid
ySy8mcceTno,...I don't trust this movie...at all
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh my god they are so late on slender man ,about 6 years too late"
ySy8mcceTno,Instead of going to 2018 we went back to 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"I will give it a chance, but it would have been better movie 4-5 years ago... It just feels dated, like Hollywood has completely dried out when it comes to inspiration."
ySy8mcceTno,"YES XD 

FINALLY

BUT why make a movie about such a old amazing character??? 

Not complaining tho"
ySy8mcceTno,"This could be a good movie.
This is one of the worst trailers I've ever seen."
ySy8mcceTno,"I've seen worse trailers than this, I don't think its worth hating yet, cause hey... At least they didnt reveal slender man or the entire plot and its twist in the trailer like most do now."
ySy8mcceTno,Its finally happening it is gonna be good
ySy8mcceTno,I dunno... Something about this trailer just seems hella cheap to me. Like how is this not some direct-to-video deal?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,"Not bad, this looks really good"
ySy8mcceTno,Spoopy

Incidentally, this movie was supposed to come out six years ago under the title ""Concrete Giraffes"". Look it up."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow slenderman started as a joke and now its a movie
ySy8mcceTno,"If they add in Slendermans proxies, I will be sold into seeing the movie"

ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this movie like 6 years late?
ySy8mcceTno,and they're making a minecraft movie too. it's not 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Not sure how I feel about this. Doesn't seem like it will be that great. Just have to wait and see I guess. But at least they are finally making a slender man movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if Sony saw Marblehornets
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so dumb
ySy8mcceTno,How many of u thought that the title was spider man 😂lol

ySy8mcceTno,Why...?
ySy8mcceTno,Why did i watch this at 11:47 pm?
ySy8mcceTno,This does not look good. When I was younger I use to like these kind of movies but as I get older I start to feel bad for the people like the girl who really did get stabbed by her friends because of some obsession with the slender man. I wonder if she can even stand to watch tv at all anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh cool i forgot this was 2007
ySy8mcceTno,"I love how all the kids that think they're cool for playing Slenderman back in 2012 want to hate this film so bad, lol."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 7 years late but whatever...
ySy8mcceTno,You're about 4 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,now that’s a name I haven’t heard of in a long time
ySy8mcceTno,6 años 6 PUTOS AÑO ESPERANDO ESTO Y POR FIN LLEGO
ySy8mcceTno,"Honey, you're 6 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't see slendermen and he did not appear so much.
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 for gay elephant noise.
ySy8mcceTno,Do more jumpscares i waited for an slenderman film have the slenderman music
ySy8mcceTno,PLOT TWIST: Logan Paul turns out to be slender man and calls himself savage and dabs a 100 times
ySy8mcceTno,"They made the emoji movie, they made an animated spiderman movie coming out, now this....




makes sense, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm a little shook after that. It's not at all what I was expecting. It might actually be kind of good."
ySy8mcceTno,Okie
ySy8mcceTno,I like these Logan Paul jokes
ySy8mcceTno,"its gonna be a 23% rating on rotten tomatoes and a 42% with the public, mark my words"
ySy8mcceTno,A few years too late Sony
ySy8mcceTno,ABOUT TIME!
ySy8mcceTno,it makes slender man not scary
ySy8mcceTno,Sony’s like the EA of the film industry
ySy8mcceTno,Hey my old 6 years old idol made an movie how awsome and cool and probably an old mystery it is
ySy8mcceTno,is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for one of my favorite series' to get ruined
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting for this..
ySy8mcceTno,Que porra é essa que eu acabei de ver?
ySy8mcceTno,STOP TURNING VIDEO GAMES INTO MOVIES!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,5 years later.
ySy8mcceTno,I waited 4 to 5 years for this movie. Why are they making one just now?
ySy8mcceTno,YYYYYYYEEEEEEESSSS
ySy8mcceTno,Where is slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es it
ySy8mcceTno,This is a great idea...if we were in 2013
ySy8mcceTno,It is just violence....no real horror whatsoever.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god the cringe
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie about Slenderman 👏👏👏👏👏👏I waited so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,El aro :v
ySy8mcceTno,Screw IT this is what I was really waiting for
ySy8mcceTno,"I think Sony might be onto something, like a...

ySy8mcceTno,OHHHHHHH
ySy8mcceTno,I'm excited
ySy8mcceTno,boi
ySy8mcceTno,i dont know how i feel about this trailer. plz let this movie be good
ySy8mcceTno,Time to rewatch marble hornets baby!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Huele a fracaso:(
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man...will it be an origin story or will this be a Let's Play format?

If its a Let's Play then I require some funny... 

(PewDiePie doesn't count, funny not stupid)"
ySy8mcceTno,That girls scream sounded like my dog wanting to pee
ySy8mcceTno,Even babadook is better than this and they were mostly in a house.
ySy8mcceTno,L
ySy8mcceTno,I'm excited but I also know Sony's making this so no high hopes
ySy8mcceTno,is this involving search of notes
ySy8mcceTno,Next is ROBLOX.. We want ROBLOX we want ROBLOX!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,When watching this movie there had better be a bathroom where funny graffiti and maybe a picture of Slender Man's mother is being shown...
ySy8mcceTno,Using a creepypasta for a movie. Jesus Christ. I'm *shook*
ySy8mcceTno,Sería mejor si respetaran lo que provoca realmente el personaje.
ySy8mcceTno,#2spooky4me
ySy8mcceTno,wow how was this green lit? who made this trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry to break it, but you’re like 6 years late if you want this movie to make a lot of money"
ySy8mcceTno,"well, that was bland."
ySy8mcceTno,"Only interested if its rated R. ""IT"" has shown us you can be faithful to your source material and still make millions in profit. 
I just don't want some bullshit PG-13 rated ""Wish Upon"" crap. 
Going in cautiously optimistic"
ySy8mcceTno,kino
ySy8mcceTno,A movie at 2k18 really omg too late . . . you know over a million of creepypastas and inventes storys and acted scenes of this its just too late Sony too late
ySy8mcceTno,Nah
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman 
Fnaf

Outlast?"
ySy8mcceTno,I must watch this film
ySy8mcceTno,If they try to copyright slender man they are going to have a hard time cutting it off from the community(P.S slender man is psychological not just scares. You don't know where he is you just know that he is and knows where you are.
ySy8mcceTno,THIS LOOKS SO GOOD!! I got goosebumps 😬
ySy8mcceTno,Why....
ySy8mcceTno,"It's about time! Granted, it's 7 years off, but finally!"
ySy8mcceTno,"It's about time! Granted, it's 7 years off, but finally!"
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yah I’ve been wanting a slender man movie ever since I knew about him
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man is still relevant? I bet that one family who’s daughter almost got killed because of her friends trying to please Slender Man is happy
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it'll be good.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would've been better if they called it Concrete Giraffes.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks intense af
ySy8mcceTno,"I knew this was going to happen one day, I've talked about a Slenderman movie going to be made and it's actually happening"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks interesting, I love stories like Slenderman so this could be good"
ySy8mcceTno,I've waited for this! For a long time
ySy8mcceTno,I've never been so scared to turn around until Slenderman came around. 😱
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it has to be grotesque to be creepy. :U
ySy8mcceTno,Is pewdiepie going to be in it? Haha
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,OOh Hell NAh
ySy8mcceTno,"Way to strike the iron while it’s hot

ySy8mcceTno,Slenderbro
ySy8mcceTno,"It's not ok for a comedian to make a satirical joke about whats happening in society, transgender, sexual assault or race for examples, but it's ok for Hollywood to capitalize on a character that caused young girls to attack another young girl.
If Dave Chappelle  an5 joke about Katlyn Jenner then Hollywood shouldn't be able to make Slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,What does any of this have to do with Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,"Why??...
-Sad Dunkey"
ySy8mcceTno,Theres nor even slender man in the trailer

ySy8mcceTno,"If those were maggots in the beginning...






Hell naw"
ySy8mcceTno,Doesnt look to promising as slender was in like trailer for 5 total seconds
ySy8mcceTno,Why didn't they make this years ago when slender was popular and people wanted a movie of it...
ySy8mcceTno,"Funny how I still have this bio pic from like 2012 when this was like the prime golden years of creepypastas, ha"
ySy8mcceTno,I let the microwave go all the way to 0 seconds at 2 a.m.
ySy8mcceTno,why cant slender man just be a regular dude with pantyhose on his head
ySy8mcceTno,Who the hell edited this trailer because it's not good. Like seriously the movie doesn't look very good but the editing of this trailer is definitely not making it look any better.
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks interesting but your 5 years late to the party. Really late, like the party hosts moved 3 years ago and now your on a strangers doorstep awkwardly holding a plate of hors d’oeuvres"
ySy8mcceTno,*WHEEZING LAUGH*
ySy8mcceTno,inb4 Stranger Things? Still looks really good though
ySy8mcceTno,This looks kinda stupid ijs
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hellllllno
ySy8mcceTno,"About 5 years too late, the slender man craze is over. What’s next, a movie about fidget spinners in 20 years?"
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer screams pg-13 and honestly it looks just as bad as all the fan trailers I've seen over the years
ySy8mcceTno,Moviento Ciudadano :v
ySy8mcceTno,2:30m of random generic shots of everything but the one thing this movie is about... and somehow you made slenderman less terrifying than a low poly game version.
ySy8mcceTno,Dam 2011 and 2012 guys are loving this one
ySy8mcceTno,who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
ySy8mcceTno,"A lot of people complaining about this coming out late, as if movies don't take time to write, cast, and film. I myself have mixed feelings about this, but I'll wait for more trailers before deciding if I would watch it or not."
ySy8mcceTno,huuuuuyyyy scaweee
ySy8mcceTno,"the only way to not be scared of slender is to search up “slenderman fanbase.” 

the fanbase straight up has at least 12 terminal illnesses and 6 tumors counting."
ySy8mcceTno,I am going to stick with Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,Helll yesssss🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
ySy8mcceTno,this looks generic af
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for this ever since the fame from the creepypasta👏🏻
ySy8mcceTno,"First someone made a fan made trailer and now we got a real trailer (3 months later) https://youtu.be/GBlJFbSGEdY Okay?!


(Year later) https://youtu.be/sg4ZZFH5hmE BOiiiiiiiiii"
ySy8mcceTno,And the creepypasta lovers awake....
ySy8mcceTno,"Well... I'm glad Hollywood is finally deciding to capitalize on this idea even if it is 4 years late. I just wish the actual movie looked good. It looks like it's just going to be another stereotypical horror movie that tries to rely to much on quick cuts that include disturbing imagery and jump scares. If this is going to be any good it'll have to be a psychological thriller similar to the babadook.  Like you could've made this into a much freakier thing if, for example, it were like a parent looking for their missing child, and you have them slowly unravel the truth as to what happened to their kid."
ySy8mcceTno,"ENSERIO SONY, un personaje creepypasta tan iconico y le dan este recibimiento. No se los demas pero a mi me hace querer vomitar solo ver el trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,"UUUUUh, Slender is dead now, you're a _bit_ late."
ySy8mcceTno,Apart from slender man being shown at the end I would of not known his is about him.
ySy8mcceTno,"2009 called, they want their horror back"
ySy8mcceTno,First 2 seconds in and I regretted clicking on this video
ySy8mcceTno,If this movie gets bad ratings its bye bye for slender man
ySy8mcceTno,T H E  G A Y  E L E P H A N T  N O I S E
ySy8mcceTno,please make this rated r.
ySy8mcceTno,Is it 2012 or.....
ySy8mcceTno,It's going to inspire more slender man freaks. Who kill
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone wanna guess what the 🍅Tomato score will be?
ySy8mcceTno,"I’ve always been a fan of the idea that Slenderman pursues children who are victims of abuse in the home. He tries to grant them a peaceful life on an otherworldly plane, but his efforts are misunderstood."
ySy8mcceTno,"Me from 2011 is so excited to see this! 
Me from 2018 is so confused why this is just now coming out..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, this wont be good. But ill be damned if im not gonna see it."
ySy8mcceTno,Please be good
ySy8mcceTno,so..... you’re telling me...i’d be going to a movie about slender man... one of my favorite myths.....and in the movie i’d see everybody *but* Slenderman. great.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony no, no, why? Why? WHYYYYYYYYYHYHYHY?"
ySy8mcceTno,Interesting 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,Send Bob and vigin pics
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like it would have been better if it followed a more mysterious realistic setting rather than a random witch-hunt style. Have the person be looking into the death of someone in a house nearby or a camper/etcr, and get caught in the loop themselves. I believe this is actually the baseline for a lot of the slender-esque games. Make them be a reporter and it makes sense they have a camera now, which goes fuzzy... this had the potential to be something truly great and nightmare-fuel but it looks like just another random horror flick."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony... Irresponsible.
ySy8mcceTno,How come I feel like I'm going to hate this movie. Can anyone tell me that? Maybe because it looks like it's going to be a Hollywood slasher unlike the psychological thriller should be.I hope I'm wrong
ySy8mcceTno,y’all should’ve thought about making this movie like 4 years ago lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like some edgy emo fan made movie......
ySy8mcceTno,"Que bueno que aun seguimos en 2012  y esta es la primera pelicula de slenderman ya estamos en 2018  ya hay peliculas de eso y  son caca y hoy en dia ya nadie le importa las creepypastas tal ves en sus comienzos si pero ahora no ,ahora ya no  hay ideas para una pelicula buena solo peliculas que hacen a lo loco cuanto que sacan la pelicula minecraft la leyenda de herobrine :v"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ya veo a los babosos diciendo, alguien tiene que llevarme a verla😍😍😍👌"
ySy8mcceTno,FEATURING MARKIPLIER
ySy8mcceTno,Proximamente Sony Pictures presenta. ´´Internet Explorer´´
ySy8mcceTno,Is it a true story or just an urban legend?
ySy8mcceTno,When the meme god to far
ySy8mcceTno,"TLDR at bottom:

For those of you asking, 'What does this have to do with Slenderman?' It's a valid question, but one with equally valid answers. For starters, Slenderman never had a 'story' when it was created--it was just the result of a photoshop contest on the forums of Something Awful. Stories and video games came later, and it was all open for interpretation, because there was no set canon about it. This movie has probably taken advantage of the open-for-interpretation opportunity as well--after all, this movie seems to be based on the creature, not the games. That being said, if they have their own original storyline, it IS (however loosely) outlined in this trailer, and it may be vague for a reason. It could be hinting at the style of movie, or maybe they just don't want to make the mistake of giving away the whole plot in the trailer, like we've seen other studios do. Another possible answer to the question is: They followed the mythos. Yes, despite how outdated Slenderman is to mainstream media, it does have it's own (continuing, might I add) mythos, and a large one at that. Within the mythos, Slenderman was always portrayed as a Lovecraftian sort of horror, and, in fact, is frequently described as 'being in your head', like the trailer says.
Slenderman has had a bad history with movies (we don't talk about Always Watching), but as a fan of the history and mythos, this movie actually doesn't look half bad. In fact, I almost feel confident enough to say I have high hopes.

TLDR: As somebody who knows the mythos, this looks like a good movie, and I think people are just hating on it because they see it as an outdated meme (which is valid tbh)."
ySy8mcceTno,what is this 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Yes SlenderMan!
ySy8mcceTno,Hasta que la sacan
ySy8mcceTno,"Hell yeah, can't wait for it to come out!"
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn't need to be a movie
ySy8mcceTno,"2017: Emoji Movie
2018: Slender Man Movie
2019: Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae) Movie
2020: Harambe Movie

Edit: adding the forgotten one, thanks to J.R.
2016: Angry Birds Movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"👏 it up for that scene where the girl who was hiding behind the tree. She looked back to see Slenderman in the distance and I though this movie was going to pull the ""Ooh, I hope it didn't see me"" and turn back and bam there it is. Instead she didn't look back and what you know, our friendly neighborhood Slenderman appeard out of nowhere. That actually made me jump a bit."
ySy8mcceTno,Wow cool
ySy8mcceTno,M3 kgu3 d mi3d0 like si lo entendiste
ySy8mcceTno,They're trying a bit too hard to make it feel like stranger things.
ySy8mcceTno,No mames Sony a eso le llamo falta de ideas
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MY WHOLE LIFE I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Truth is, the concept of Slender Man is one that can make a great horror movie, my hopes are this trailer is just the usual misleading horror trailer studios often make (It Comes At Night, The Babadook, It Follows, etc),the great thing about the slender man concept is that you can use the elements of paranoia and tension to create not just a good, but a great horror movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Can we not?
ySy8mcceTno,NO WIFIN IN DA CLUB GIMMIE 20 DOLLARS
ySy8mcceTno,"This honestly is a horrible idea, how do you even make this into a movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,Directed by Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,I wish it had a story line built to the game concept where the woman finds pieces of paper to save her daughter that was missing for a long time and then the mom gets killed because of slenderman but its like in first person view that would be even more lit
ySy8mcceTno,I really am looking forword into watching this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Lit af
ySy8mcceTno,Good job guys you are only 5000 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like the ""Don't Watch This"" tape from The Ring"
ySy8mcceTno,What next? Are they gonna have to find the pages too?!
ySy8mcceTno,Why is everyone bombarding this movie of a famous creepypasta character?
ySy8mcceTno,Did they just make a movie of a creppypasta?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty awful
ySy8mcceTno,Stickman!
ySy8mcceTno,There’s a movie now? Jeez I remember when It was just a theory and a game
ySy8mcceTno,when dark water meet the eye
ySy8mcceTno,You have got to be kidding me
ySy8mcceTno,You're only 8 years late
ySy8mcceTno,she’s not a man
ySy8mcceTno,😂😂😂 do they even know who or what slenderman is?
ySy8mcceTno,Latinoamérica?
ySy8mcceTno,looks cool
ySy8mcceTno,"As typical these days, they give the whole thing away in the overlong trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer looks like they smashed about of random scary clips together and called it a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This Is stupid
ySy8mcceTno,*este es el baile de slendey la anguila*
ySy8mcceTno,:v uffff se ve que estara de las nalgas esta pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,How is this not trending in Australia?
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul's apology video is more scary
ySy8mcceTno,Pennywhise vs slender man? Who wins
ySy8mcceTno,=( looks like they missed the mark
ySy8mcceTno,I had high hopes but no! I got a crappy unorganized piece of garage with people barely talking in general
ySy8mcceTno,Not as good as marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Yea I was planing on watching it and then I watched the trailer ✌️
ySy8mcceTno,The best part was at the part where you can see him in the fog there was no musical cue when he was seen it was super effective 0_0
ySy8mcceTno,That was kinda lame
ySy8mcceTno,Middle school horror. Thanks but I'll stick to my shitty slasher movies from the 80s-90s
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 I can see him 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"This feels more like demon spooping ppl. This doesnt feel like ""Slendy""."
ySy8mcceTno,prolly gonna bomb in the box office.
ySy8mcceTno,Esto es official? O es Fake?
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks genuinely awful. Not too surprising, though, considering it is 
A. An outdated horror icon 
B. Made by Sony
C. Looks like it mixes 
 bullshit wannabe psychological horror (like that found in Oculus) with PG13 jumpscares."
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't see Slenderman the entire time while I was watching the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,This is amazing
ySy8mcceTno,What?! Someone has gone missing in the woods?! Hang in there! Logan Paul will find you!
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,Ya salio con sus mamadas otra vez sony :v
ySy8mcceTno,You already know it'll be bad. Dumb high pitched sounds and cliche jumpscares.
ySy8mcceTno,"youtube actually reccomend good stuff for once
......




i hope its good"
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah Sony your about 10 years too late on this one.
ySy8mcceTno,Si esto sale en SDLG :v Paso 40GB de Packs:v
ySy8mcceTno,i think this movie came late
ySy8mcceTno,"20...20...2011 is that you?
Yeah man what’s up how’s it going 
Not too good man miss you 
Really? Sorry to hear that.
Yeah
Hey are you gonna see my movie
Ahahahahahha no"
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Slender boi back at it again
ySy8mcceTno,"the idea of a slenderman movie seems stale since he lost relevancy years ago
but it can be great if done right
and after seeing this trailer
seems like it isnt gonna be done right"
ySy8mcceTno,Little late
ySy8mcceTno,YES THEY MADE IT A REAL THJNG
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally got a trailer.. Gotta say, I'm disappointed.. As someone who has interest in filmmaking and acting I was excited at the idea of a movie about the slenderman but this was more visually disgusting than scary, build tension. Gotta admit though i like that the slenderman isn't shown in the trailer much"
ySy8mcceTno,*Hope they don't Ruin Slender Mans Legacy💯👌*
ySy8mcceTno,So they are finally doing a video on them
ySy8mcceTno,"Don’t get me wrong, I like the creepypasta of slender man. But I don’t see it as a good bace for a horror movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait....
I think i saw logan back there filming a video"
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"Voy a serles sincera... Que la película no llegue a cines, y les dare dos motivos: Slenderman, para mucha gente ya esta muerto somos pocos los que aun nos emocionamos con eso, tal vez por 2012 y chance 2013 habria pegado bien, claro, sino fuera porque no veo nada que tenga que ver con él, solo me afocan a una niña aterrada y confundida seguida de breves escenas de ""terror""

¿Tan siquiera leyeron su creepypasta? Porque la verdad no veo a ningun adolescente a punto de suicidarse o una terrible catástrofe provocada por un científico loco y mucho menos una personificación clara, de hecho este Slenderman me recuerda a los ""huecos "" de ""El hogar de Miss Peregrine para niños peculiares"" ahora que fueron representados en su película.

Pero en serio si continúan este proyecto va a fracasar, a lo mucho les gustara a aquellos que ignoran el verdadero creepypasta pero para los que si sabemos, la película será aburrida y descarrilada."
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like I'm gonna die in 7 days after watching this
ySy8mcceTno,lol this game old af
ySy8mcceTno,"When I heard about this, I first thought it was a fake trailer that everyone was reacting to."
ySy8mcceTno,I remember I thought slenderman was real back in 6th grade
ySy8mcceTno,"""Canyouseehim"" no cause slender only got a couple seconds of screen time and that's it"
ySy8mcceTno,This should've stayed in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,You're like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,gay
ySy8mcceTno,Man I would’ve been excited for this if it was 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Can I see someone get stabbed in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this trailer real!?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty cool
ySy8mcceTno,O MY FACKING'S GUYS!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Ehhh......
ySy8mcceTno,movie is like 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"7 Days...




Oh, come on. You can't tell me you DIDN'T get a The Ring vibe from this."
ySy8mcceTno,I CAN'T WAIT
ySy8mcceTno,Where is Logan paul
ySy8mcceTno,Guys whats with the logan paul and jake paul stuff! this movie is about slender man not dumb logan paul!
ySy8mcceTno,Back in my day slender man was just a horror game and all you got to do is find 8 pages and then I don't 10 years later there making of movie about it.
ySy8mcceTno,About 4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,De casualidad aparece Jason? Digo el trailer es tan cliché que podría aparecer
ySy8mcceTno,Me parece que la van a cagar
ySy8mcceTno,This looks cuteish
ySy8mcceTno,It’s Sony and something that’s guaranteed to bring in at least some money. I doubt it’ll be good as they’re only going to such in half of what they expect to make and put in the minimum amount of effort.
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if Idubbbz is going to touch on this topic anytime soon
ySy8mcceTno,Not fun unless you play the game
ySy8mcceTno,ᴡᴇᴡ
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow...I just finished writing a slender series a few weeks ago!...but I have a more in depth story than this Hollywood garbage...check out my series on Wattpad...my username is ""isaak_zack""...very much appreciated!"
ySy8mcceTno,Any horror movie with children is terrible IMO. Try me
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t even resemble any of the slenders I played...
ySy8mcceTno,IRRELEVANT
ySy8mcceTno,*heart rate increases* *5th grade flashbacks apear* no NO (i actually wanna see this tho tbh)
ySy8mcceTno,Im so confused
ySy8mcceTno,children of the corn meets online stories and memes
ySy8mcceTno,¿Donde esta el pinchi wey corriendo  con la cámara recogiendo las hojas? A quien carajos le importa la mocosa esa...
ySy8mcceTno,The IT of 2018?
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for slender man's appearance in infinity war..
ySy8mcceTno,No movie can ever capture the fear of going into the bathrooms to find that last page
ySy8mcceTno,So many Logan Paul jokes
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,"*You know Hollywood is really running out of Ideas when they decide to make a movie based of a trend from five years ago*

lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Go watch this at the theater and expect nothing but 12 year olds.
ySy8mcceTno,Another one horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks pretty cool and spooky
ySy8mcceTno,When we will be done with slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul just did marketing 2 the movie :o
ySy8mcceTno,I really wish this would be good but cmon when has a movie about a game ever been good? Not comic wise but game wise and actually took the lore. Rip DBZ and Assassin Creed
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets will always be the real slenderman series
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully this movie turns out good because this is nothing like the games or anything hopefully there’s parts like that in the movie but it’s just a teasers hopefully they add the 8 pages
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets?
ySy8mcceTno,Because this will DEFINITELY not bomb. Nope.
ySy8mcceTno,They are 5 to 6 years late on this movie
ySy8mcceTno,When you’re late to the slender man bandwagon and make a horrible quality movie about something that is low longer relevant.
ySy8mcceTno,Ugh.
ySy8mcceTno,"*Thanks, but You're 5 years late.* It's all about the FNAF movie now.






Also, this really isn't the time. [""So sorry.""]"
ySy8mcceTno,"Esta pelicula podria tener cualquier otro nombre y seria lo mismo
Lo que quiero decir es que si es la película de Sleder-man por que aunque sea no nos muestra un poco de su body 😂♡ 
Con lo alto que es xd"
ySy8mcceTno,There a couple years late...
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like it'll be awful, ill still watch it though. But i swear to fucking god if i see any kind of ""eight pages"" i'm going to kms, and im rating it a one star."
ySy8mcceTno,"So is it supposed to be ""Creepypasta"" SM or a different Slender?"
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Wow a creepypasta actually turns into a film never saw this coming
ySy8mcceTno,No Ps Woow :V
ySy8mcceTno,Ygotas Joey voice: a slender Man movie? Hollywood is really out of ideas now.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,what no slenderman song? you fail
ySy8mcceTno,LET THERE BE A MARKIPLIER CAMEO
ySy8mcceTno,"This is gonna be bad... I hate horror stories that focus on the scary instead of a solid storyline. I rather take a Slender Man movie with a great story than a one with just creepy visuals and trying hard to scare me. Movies like ""IT"" and Halloween 1&2"" did this flawlessly. No too scary but the storytelling was awesome."
ySy8mcceTno,"This is gonna be one of those ""Scary"" movies where the actual thing (monster, alien, demon) comes out only 1 time at the end of the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,like i said they will make any movie just look at the emoji movie next thing you know the water movie
ySy8mcceTno,"La hubieran hecho en el 2012, ahorita nadie la va a ver"
ySy8mcceTno,The original creator of this game and the guy who made the creepy pasta better get paid asfucc
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay so far there's a movie about a social media website (Facebook), a movie about a phone app (Angry Birds), a movie about a bunch of faces and objects on your phone's texting feature (The Emoji Movie), and now they're making a movie about an internet horror meme."
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't wait to see how this movie turns out, it can be a starter for movies about creepypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul approved
ySy8mcceTno,5 años tarde de las tendencia
ySy8mcceTno,"Worst trailer ever no camera static effects, it’s the best part bout Slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,Lolololololololololo
ySy8mcceTno,Is this actually real or fan made?
ySy8mcceTno,AMA Be Laughing When I Go To The theaters Then There Only 13 Year Old Mexican With Black Neck Watching This Movie 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Is this supposed to be scary?
ySy8mcceTno,Few years too late... Sorry
ySy8mcceTno,Can you see him.   Wait you aren’t even suppose too look at him or you die.
ySy8mcceTno,A tad late don't you think?
ySy8mcceTno,Yeahh .....where is peter parker ?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!! A real Slender movie!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Finally A Movie About Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,the end of the trailer should have had static.
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s Logan Paul?
ySy8mcceTno,I knew they were gonna turn this into a movie 😍
ySy8mcceTno,Khe berga .-.
ySy8mcceTno,IF HE DOSNNT HAVE HIS SUIT!! IM OUT BRO!!! IM OUT!
ySy8mcceTno,"Really good or really bad, make your vote"
ySy8mcceTno,Have u read the Bible?
ySy8mcceTno,Those girls could of just done this movie and they would of found Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,"This is the thing. Almost the whole time, they don't have enough faith to its original form. Slender, both the game and its creepypasta, isn't supposed to be jumpscares all of the time and grotesque. In fact, the reason why Slender blew up was because of its horror element that enticed the reader/player. The feeling of being watched, not knowing who or what it is, or where it is, is the reason why it was so significant. It wasn't all, ""Oh MaN, lOoK! sTuFf iS cOmInG oUt Of HeR mOuTh! So ScArY!"". (It also blew up because of YouTubers, but, ya know.)"
ySy8mcceTno,The movie in spanish in Mexico?
ySy8mcceTno,what creepypasta fans have been waiting for.
ySy8mcceTno,whos mans is this????? XD
ySy8mcceTno,Looks amazing. Hope it's 2 hrs and 30 mins long
ySy8mcceTno,"He's just looking for Sally, guys."
ySy8mcceTno,It's 2018 everone forgot about him
ySy8mcceTno,"Un verdadero Fracaso ..... 
Primera película del 2018"
ySy8mcceTno,8 years late :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice, a Slenderman movie.

*Looks at the channel that posted the trailer*

Oh god, it's made by Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,This is a little too late to be making a movie of this. Should have done it when it was popular. But maybe they held it back after that fucked up sacrifice with those little girls because they believed in Slenderman when it was too popular.
ySy8mcceTno,Where was this movie like 4 years ago when it was relevant
ySy8mcceTno,¿Qué sigue? ¿Jeff the killer? :v
ySy8mcceTno,just wanna say that this trailer looks but ik I'm gonna watch so I need to know if this was based on the plot from the game. like the one from 2013 or 14. it could be better but obviously it's not sadly
ySy8mcceTno,Your a few years too late sony..
ySy8mcceTno,It ain’t 2012 why is this happening now?
ySy8mcceTno,The 2012 game is scarier than this
ySy8mcceTno,Finally there making the first creepypasta movie for once
ySy8mcceTno,"Rip me. I haven't watched it yet, pray for me"
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all late on this this was popular like years ago lmai
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSS
ySy8mcceTno,Of course this comes from Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Dope asf I stl
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all are 2000 and l8😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,It would be kind of cool if there was a post credit scene with Jeff The killer.
ySy8mcceTno,Kind of a shitty trailer
ySy8mcceTno,ded meme
ySy8mcceTno,"When I saw this on trending, I was like, “There’s no way this is legit.”
I’m have a mixture of feelings right now. I love it and I think this is many years late XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Real stuff?
ySy8mcceTno,It's just some guy in a suit.
ySy8mcceTno,It’s like i’m watching the tape from the ring
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this turns out as good as ‘Everyman HYBRID’ or ‘Marble Hornets’
ySy8mcceTno,"‘,:( this is real? I thought we were only getting the fnaf movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Do u know the muffin man? Muffin man movie coming soon to theaters July 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Que mierda de tráiler
ySy8mcceTno,This isn’t minecraft
ySy8mcceTno,For a Moment I thought SpiderMan Trailer 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dope
ySy8mcceTno,"hmmm is this a movie coming out? and is it going to explian why he has no face?
cause what is that black stuff. wait... he has a white face not a black face"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony no la vallas a cagar por favor este personaje debería ser muy tétrico y escalofriante no me parece bueno el tráiler porque slenderman se ve que no tiene tanto protagonismo pienso que en esta película no se va a ver casi a slenderman solo creo que se vera por ahí 5 minutos traten de darle vida al tipo denle macabridad no lo hagan como un palo con traje elegante deseo buenas espectativas para esta movie y mejoren eso
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy Tubbies was scarier for me lol
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna watch it but at the same time I don't
ySy8mcceTno,xjoshisfunnyx
ySy8mcceTno,Oh alrighty then
ySy8mcceTno,Finally We all are going to find out who dat Slender Man is!!😅
ySy8mcceTno,La cagaron like a dead note.
ySy8mcceTno,what the heck it's going on here? >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol they are turning creepypastas into movies now? What's next? Squidward's suicide? 😂 Also, this looks boring af"
ySy8mcceTno,Dude when I was 12 I was scared shitless of Slender Man. This movie is gonna get to me.
ySy8mcceTno,Shame this looks awful and cliche. A concept like this can be genuinely scary if executed well
ySy8mcceTno,PLEASELETTHISBEREAL!PLEASE!
ySy8mcceTno,Freddy Krueger
ySy8mcceTno,This is super creepy
ySy8mcceTno,This is the most generic horror movie trailer I have ever seen in my entire life
ySy8mcceTno,So this is not gonna be a found footage movie? Sweet
ySy8mcceTno,"Would love to see Proxy Kate or Charle in this (as in a Easter Egg or a mention of some kind) 

Then again, their more part of the game's storyline (unless this becomes part of that cannon)"
ySy8mcceTno,"I might be misunderstanding but... last I checked, Slender Man does *not* growl. :/"
ySy8mcceTno,отстой халтурный
ySy8mcceTno,"Not only are they late to make this, but I have a feeling the trailer is going to be better than the movie itself."
ySy8mcceTno,7 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Movie tickets on me if y’all are in Arizona and wanna see it
ySy8mcceTno,"the wendigo and skinwalker are scarier plus they are based on real stories. I know this is too, but these are more recent. the wendigo and skinwalker have been around a lot longer"
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years to late bro, 5 years to late."
ySy8mcceTno,"What part of ""leave it to the professionals"" doesn't anyone understand? !"
ySy8mcceTno,Way to strike the iron while it's hot
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would be so much better with a car...
ySy8mcceTno,This is 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"You guys could have recorded PewDiePie playing slenderman, It would have been scarier.
And please tell me PewDiePie contributed to this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome! If this was 2012 id be ecstatic!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This would be alot better if slender man didn't die along with its fandom in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,It came true
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy AF! No thanks...😑
ySy8mcceTno,Already starting the year good!
ySy8mcceTno,Who thinks that the movie will introduce his proxies at the end?
ySy8mcceTno,KHE JERRY TIPO EL ARO
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all are five years late...
ySy8mcceTno,Looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,SONY my boy have you seen the time 5 fucking years you had 5 fucking years to make slender man
ySy8mcceTno,It okay but tbh they could have done better
ySy8mcceTno,Hola
ySy8mcceTno,Mira pues >:v
ySy8mcceTno,This'll probably be one of those shitty horror movies that has a monster yet we never get to see it and they're so late on this
ySy8mcceTno,"SLENDERMAN=DEMAGORGAN???

Sorry I’ll go home."
ySy8mcceTno,WOOOOOOOOW
ySy8mcceTno,NO FUCKING WAY!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer don’t even look good
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man in 2018? Really?
ySy8mcceTno,looks like the typical recycled Hollywood teen horror garbage.  going to ruin slenderman.  so much potential to make a good horror movie from the source material.
ySy8mcceTno,Desde acá ya puedo ver el fracaso comercial de esta película.
ySy8mcceTno,You have no idea how long I've waited for this
ySy8mcceTno,Yet another video game movie that is bound to be a flop.
ySy8mcceTno,Another Masterpiece after *IT FOLLOWS* ?
ySy8mcceTno,Yesss
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was Spiderman in a thumbnail. 😁😁😁
ySy8mcceTno,Wat
ySy8mcceTno,Your really late on this slender man is dead now😂
ySy8mcceTno,is real?
ySy8mcceTno,There’s a lot of things concerning a forest on the trending page. Cough cough #logang4lyfe
ySy8mcceTno,Yea slender man movie is there already one idk
ySy8mcceTno,I think logan paul act's in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Way to keep with the trends Sony...........NOT
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, wtf is the plot, can someone explain plz"
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG
OMG
OMG
OMG
OMGGGGGGG
TO SCARY😖😖😖😖😖😖"
ySy8mcceTno,I already know it's probably gonna be trash XD it doesn't look scary
ySy8mcceTno,se mira bien culera :V
ySy8mcceTno,The worst thing Somethingawful ever made
ySy8mcceTno,wtf u dont need a movie come to the woods next to mah house and you will have a whole slenderman show
ySy8mcceTno,SONY STOP MAKING MOVIES! Please!
ySy8mcceTno,Boi
ySy8mcceTno,Can I just say *finally* ?!?!?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is a joke.
ySy8mcceTno,very good
ySy8mcceTno,No way their making a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,What did I just watch? There was no type of plot line or concept to this trailer. Just dark scenes and a girl thats scared..
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn’t expecting this tbh.....
ySy8mcceTno,Little late there sony..
ySy8mcceTno,YES YES YES 🤯🔥🔥
ySy8mcceTno,7 years late
ySy8mcceTno,It's obvious this movie is going to be a disaster.
ySy8mcceTno,Y el sonido característico de la cámara dañada? >:(
ySy8mcceTno,feel proud to have watched under 80k
ySy8mcceTno,Looks more like the Ring where gonna see more of people going crazy than Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,These people are like...10 years late on making this.
ySy8mcceTno,10years later bruh
ySy8mcceTno,"This honestly has a lot of potential to be a genuine scary, intense film, but a
Sadly since it is a game based film, it probably will not work"
ySy8mcceTno,Movie looks boring
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Why isn't he wearing his Agent 47 black suit?
ySy8mcceTno,#cantseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my lord their bringing this back 🙄🙄
ySy8mcceTno,Is slender still a thing anymore a little too late for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Despite how late this is. I'd rather be seeing this on trending than Logan Paul's dumb apology.
ySy8mcceTno,Starring Brandon Ingram
ySy8mcceTno,I would’ve been excited for this 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hope this is better than ""Always Watching"". That Marble Hornets movie no one cared about. Rightly so, because it sucked."
ySy8mcceTno,So basically stranger Things season 3
ySy8mcceTno,Please make this the first in a cinematic  universe  plz😇
ySy8mcceTno,And yet another example of Sony being years behind on trends...
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was Super Man
ySy8mcceTno,Were his tentacles
ySy8mcceTno,this better not be a let down
ySy8mcceTno,Were his long arms
ySy8mcceTno,You’re 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer is next I hope
ySy8mcceTno,YEA
ySy8mcceTno,haha long boy
ySy8mcceTno,And look who's making it? Same people that made the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t care if it’s late it looks so fucking scary I love it I’m so gonna watch this
ySy8mcceTno,"At this point, Sony as a studio seems only to exist for the sole purpose of proving that it can't do anything right."
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks terrible. And that really sucks because a Slender Man movie has buckets of potential. Slender Man shouldn't be a jump scare fest, it should be a psychological horror film that makes you wonder the whole film, 'Is Slender Man real, or is it all an illusion?'. I'd love to see a Slender Man movie, but not like this."
ySy8mcceTno,Like if happy 😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😅😀😅😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
ySy8mcceTno,This is funny
ySy8mcceTno,**COUGH** Logan Paul **COUGH**
ySy8mcceTno,"3 reasons i like Sony
-Spider Verse movie
-Venom movie
-Slenderman movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh he just needs 20 dollars smh
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, Sony.... Just.... Stop."
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how terrifying this movie would seem to that girl who was victim to that attack by her friends in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,HAY NO MAMES WEEEEY
ySy8mcceTno,I've always wanted a slender man movie to be made but this looks like it's gonna be terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"People have been asking for a film since the game came out. Well, here it is, a little late ofc, like everyone else is saying in the comments."
ySy8mcceTno,Eh... Just go watch Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony... 🖕
ySy8mcceTno,"NO YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD, ITS 2018 GO BACK TO 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,no mamen estamos en 2k18 y quien putas habla de Slender
ySy8mcceTno,Doik Doki Literature Club 2026?
ySy8mcceTno,"the true horror is Logan Paul, lurking in the forest with his video recorder, looking for more victims to exploit for clickbait"
ySy8mcceTno,Spoiler: Someone  stop him by giving him 20$
ySy8mcceTno,"I like all the people complaining that it's ""five years late"" and im just here saying to myself ""wow, im just happy creepypasta is actually getting mainstream attention"""
ySy8mcceTno,"The creepy pasta for his 
own movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry Hollywood but I like my evil monsters to have more meat on their bones. More cushion for the execution.
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta game in to a creepy movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Alv :0
ySy8mcceTno,What are the odds Sony fucks this up?
ySy8mcceTno,"2 minutos y 39 segundos y solo en 2 segundos nos muestran a Slenderman >:v
Espero que la película muestre a Slenderman y no solo lo muestre por 10 minutos la película se llama Slenderman no se llama como la protagonista queremos a Slenderman en toda la película
En realidad el trailer no nos muestra nada solo una niña que sufre de algo y ya espero que la película sea buena y que nos MUESTREN A SLENDERMAN POR MAS DE 1 HORA HA QUE LA PELICULA SE LLAMA SLENDERMAN NO SE LLAMA LA NIÑA ESA >:v"
ySy8mcceTno,"As i expected. Sony would make a movie out of this, but i didnt expect it to be published in 2018. You guys are like too goddamn late."
ySy8mcceTno,Looking good 👍
ySy8mcceTno,They are actually creating a movie about slender man....it's about time
ySy8mcceTno,Omg😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤👑👑👑👑👏👏👏👏
ySy8mcceTno,At first I thought this was a joke now Sony is just running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,I clicked it cause I thought it said Spider Man O_O
ySy8mcceTno,The twist is that Slender man is actually Logan Paul and he just wants to record the dead bodies
ySy8mcceTno,Its probably going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,That game was dead
ySy8mcceTno,Should've just based it on the girl who got stabbed by her friends tbh
ySy8mcceTno,7 años tarde
ySy8mcceTno,So which kid is gonna start stabbing the others?
ySy8mcceTno,Who else noticed this movie is 6 years behind schedule.
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks super cliche and bad. 
If you want a good slenderman/ operator movie watch marble hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,"Next they're going to make an emoji movie.... 







Oh"
ySy8mcceTno,starring jake paul  as slender
ySy8mcceTno,Sony come ON you made a movie about emojis now a guy that’s tall and just COME ON SONY!
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that this movie is from Sony Screen Gems is the only thing I see here that is terrifying.
ySy8mcceTno,"1. The Slenderman trend is over.
2. Growing up in Wisconsin near where the Slenderman killing happened this is not ok."
ySy8mcceTno,And people said PewDiePie was running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is gonna be bad...

That’s just my feeling"
ySy8mcceTno,Somewhere off in the distance I can hear a 2013 pewdiepie screaming to this
ySy8mcceTno,Next is fnaf
ySy8mcceTno,And this is why I don’t go in forests at night
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late no ?
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm I'm getting the vibe that slender Man will drive his victims insane.then  actually come up to kill them.
ySy8mcceTno,This gonna get a lot of sins on CinemaSins
ySy8mcceTno,Puto trailler no dice nimadres son puras mamadas
ySy8mcceTno,4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I am gonna hate this. Sony is involved after all.
ySy8mcceTno,Base it off Arrival and I’ll definitely Be terrified
ySy8mcceTno,is this legit?
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s 6 years late, back then it use to be one of the best scary games before there are different versions of slender."
ySy8mcceTno,"I see fanmades but this is a big wow man..
Yeah that look so creepy and i love it.
I cant wait to se the movie <3"
ySy8mcceTno,Hello 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Please tell me this will actually be good and not ruin this grandfather of a creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Starring Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,inb4 all youtube videos of slender from years ago get copyright strikes
ySy8mcceTno,Who ever made the original creepypasta should get royalties
ySy8mcceTno,5 years from now we'll get a horror movie about fidget spinners
ySy8mcceTno,"The werid noise i
Was hurting my ears"
ySy8mcceTno,"BWAHAHAHAHA, why isnt he doing gangnumstyle"
ySy8mcceTno,Crazy can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,MARBLE HORNETS DID IT BETTER.
ySy8mcceTno,Why now? In 2018?
ySy8mcceTno,AWW HELL NAW BOI
ySy8mcceTno,This movie will fail like any other movie made by Sony
ySy8mcceTno,My 4th grade self is quaking.
ySy8mcceTno,"UUgh, how to do Slender Man totally wrong. Jesus Christ, people are IDIOTS. It ought be a minimalist horror movie about a guy in the cold North East."
ySy8mcceTno,Much better than what Sony has done lately
ySy8mcceTno,"Not impressed. It's like the trailer's trying to confuse us with a bunch of unrelated stuff. Sony, the concept is simple... tall guy stalking people. Don't over-complicate it."
ySy8mcceTno,I am disappoint.
ySy8mcceTno,Ok so we see that there’s a movie about the character slender man. But where is slender man? I never saw him in this trailer but some dolls or kids but just see him in the end. So good. And also so late.
ySy8mcceTno,I’d punch slender man is his nose
ySy8mcceTno,They make slender man growl like a monster like a creature when he’s supposed to be creepy
ySy8mcceTno,The body Logan found in the woods must be from slender
ySy8mcceTno,So this is gonna be a real slender man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so good! Can't wait to watch.
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought big movie company's would understand. How bad a impact this game had and never make this movie, but all they care about is money."
ySy8mcceTno,Come on sony. U can't be late to everything
ySy8mcceTno,"Again the bible proves truth in the last days good will be evil ,evil will be good ,not to fear good will prevail if I where a sinner I would chose Jesus the winning team"
ySy8mcceTno,They done did it
ySy8mcceTno,Dafuq is this
ySy8mcceTno,"This kinda pissed me off

Slender man IS not what you think he is! 

Yeah maybe this whole thing seems so true 
But it's not what he really is.."
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else come here from concrete elephants?
ySy8mcceTno,This film is a first person perspective of logan Paul in a suicide forest Filming dead people.
ySy8mcceTno,no salio logan paul ahi en el bosque
ySy8mcceTno,Gg
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s Logan Paul?
ySy8mcceTno,fucking slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,OMG this will give me nightmares after I  watch this movie!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This woulda been like like 4 yrs ago
ySy8mcceTno,Girl bye! You’re late
ySy8mcceTno,Is this about those two girls who stabbed that other girl
ySy8mcceTno,"Watch marble hornets, it’s better"
ySy8mcceTno,wack
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a parody?
ySy8mcceTno,"Seems like they are staying true to the original legend. The camouflage, the victims scycolis, and turning victims into proxy's to lure in the next victim."
ySy8mcceTno,So when will Sony produce something original again? Who knows.....
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna start it all back up !!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Next they gonna make a dramatic version of Doki Doki Literature Club
ySy8mcceTno,Needs the Slenderman song at least.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man is a dead internet meme. You're too late Sony. Low key though, I would watch this. Brings me back to my pre-teen years."
ySy8mcceTno,"Time check, hmmm let's see *looks at watch* huh weird I thought it was still 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,i so foking asome
ySy8mcceTno,People are actually offended that this movie came late. 2018 looks shite already
ySy8mcceTno,anyone else confused as hell?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is dead
ySy8mcceTno,"Judging by the trailer obviously, it seems more like a shock film than horror."
ySy8mcceTno,-\('-')/-
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was spider man and clicked on it... Man was I wrong...
ySy8mcceTno,"if you’re reading this, slender man will get you."
ySy8mcceTno,"gosh darn
please don't be bad please don't be bad please don't be bad please don't be bad please don't be bad please don't be bad please don't be bad please don't be bad *please don't be bad* *please don't be bad* *please don't be bad* *please don't be bad* *please don't be bad* *please don't be bad*"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh !
ySy8mcceTno,"Really, is this even necessary? Also this may just be me but there seems to be way to much stuff going on in this trailer. Less is more Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,This is a bad idea sony
ySy8mcceTno,Movimiento naranja!!!
ySy8mcceTno,So now i want a movie of jeff the killer or eyeless jack
ySy8mcceTno,So when is redlettermedia getting their check in the mail?
ySy8mcceTno,More excited for The Nun and Crooked man
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if the girl who got stabbed by the girls who worship slendy is gonna watch this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is the guy whos head twitches ticci toby??? I really hope we get to see masky and ticci Toby in this movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"The only way this will be good is if it's anyway similar to the Slenderverse on YouTube (marble hornets, every man hybrid, tribe twelve, etc.) There already was a slender Man movie that cashed in on the marble hornets name, but that was garbage. I will remain skeptical, but I'm just glad it isn't coming out in January."
ySy8mcceTno,Who all seen the low budget slender man film
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve que es una película de terror psicológico
ySy8mcceTno,:3
ySy8mcceTno,Do you have to find the 8 pages tho?
ySy8mcceTno,Dude I can't wait its going to be amazing 👌
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this look like a ad for the ring 3😭😭
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,You're 4 years behind Sony
ySy8mcceTno,The movie looks good but I just know it's going to fail sry
ySy8mcceTno,i thought we got over this.. DON'T ASUME ITS GENDER!!!
ySy8mcceTno,It looks really good
ySy8mcceTno,They didn’t collect the pages smh
ySy8mcceTno,Wow I didn’t know it’s 2012 oh wait
ySy8mcceTno,Download the Scoopbroker App to start earning cash today!
ySy8mcceTno,Death note 2.
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: Eh. This movie could be interesting.
(Sees Sony is involved)
Me: This movie's gonna suck."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this about those girls who tried to kill their friend ?
ySy8mcceTno,I require to to cease in this action
ySy8mcceTno,"50% comments: ""way too late""
Other 50%: ""Logan paul would fit great"""
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Christ. The comments section on this video is gonna be a shitstorm I can tell
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone else thinks this looks really cheaply made? Like a $100,000 Blumhouse movie, or a student film."
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Gangnam Style ?
ySy8mcceTno,They couldn't even get the look of slender man right.  It's gonna be trash.
ySy8mcceTno,Is Logan Paul the editor?
ySy8mcceTno,This litterly has nothing to do with slender man. All it was showing was child's with depression who were getting lost.
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s the popeye movie?
ySy8mcceTno,And congrats for being so late on this!
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul would have been laughing at the girls suicide in the classroom.
ySy8mcceTno,"Pensé que estaría mas épico... un estilo mas ""REC"" me refiero a cámara en mano o algo parecido o si no era así, algo distinto a esto, pero que mas puedo pedir? Ya se habían tardado en sacar una película de Slender Man"
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like a good topic but i dont really see what slender man has to do in this trailer other than the end.
ySy8mcceTno,I know this movie seems late and generic but guess who's gonna spend money to see it?!.....uh idk your guess is as good as mine sony made this horror movie I'm not watching it. Lol
ySy8mcceTno,I suspect a really dumb movie just by seeing the girl overplaying her part...
ySy8mcceTno,Finally what took you so long just to make this movie and the game didint take so long
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man in 2018? 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Marble Hornets are mentioned in some way
ySy8mcceTno,¿Y las notas en el bosque?
ySy8mcceTno,"Make all the edgy jokes you want. I actually think this movie will turn out great, even if it’s years late. Remember, Sony Pictures is a movie company, and it takes time to create and release a movie. Anyways, hopefully this will be an amazing horror movie, and I can’t wait until it comes out!"
ySy8mcceTno,Mameeees! Eso ya pasó de moda como hace 5 años
ySy8mcceTno,seems sketchy...
ySy8mcceTno,"Demogorgon or Slenderman?
*Which is creepier?*"
ySy8mcceTno,If we're making creepy pasta movies can we get a squidwards suicide or what
ySy8mcceTno,About time but let’s be honest sonny is gonna mess this up
ySy8mcceTno,"I was wondering when they would make it a movie... It honestly looks dumb and not even scary, if that was their intention..."
ySy8mcceTno,CREEPYPASTA FANS RISE UP!
ySy8mcceTno,I'm calling it now people are going to suddenly start cleaning to see Slenderman again.
ySy8mcceTno,Idk why they making this movie to get ratings
ySy8mcceTno,On god?
ySy8mcceTno,I’m punishing myself by watching this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,You're many years late on the trend but it looks great. Can't wait to see it
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the first CP adapted to movie?
ySy8mcceTno,You are a looong time late sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie is amnesia confirmed starring pewdiepie
ySy8mcceTno,"Been like a few years, it better be good"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t the game like nearly a decade old now
ySy8mcceTno,Oie zy
ySy8mcceTno,"oh no baby what is you doing, you’re so late to this"
ySy8mcceTno,Wack
ySy8mcceTno,WHY ARE EVERY SINGLE SCENES SO PREDICTABLE!?
ySy8mcceTno,"This is really sad bc one girl almost got killed bc of this fictional character and now there making a movie about it, this really hurts my heart 😔😔😔"
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, another reason for kids to attempt murder."
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks surprisingly very well done
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks very mediocre. Come on Sony, step up."
ySy8mcceTno,Tarde 15 años tarde
ySy8mcceTno,This is real weird cuz that girl that stabbed the one chick had just got her sentence
ySy8mcceTno,This is so dumb
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how many more stabbings will happen after this. Lol
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie many wanted







6 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,"It's like they took a page from ""The Ring"" with all the lil flash backs of really disturbing images.. looks good and creepy"
ySy8mcceTno,Is the Hollywood running out of horror movie ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,*Oh hell yes*
ySy8mcceTno,Stop.....plz stop making movies about game
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe this started as a creepypasta and a few photos by a photographer. To think what the internet can do.......
ySy8mcceTno,Sony YOUR SOO LATE
ySy8mcceTno,Wasnt slender man just a creepy pasta and a sketch painting
ySy8mcceTno,"I guess Hollywood has never read a creepypasta......
They aren't good"
ySy8mcceTno,I watch the whole trailer desperately to get interested in the movie but the trailer was so bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"Is it really true now???????........ After a looooong times is finally made a movie?????!!!!! I wait that’s 7 year too, I hope is good PLEASE!!!!😫😫🤩"
ySy8mcceTno,My inner 2012 edgy self is quaking
ySy8mcceTno,"Happy holidays  and new year everyone  

Did you know that  people never smiled in old photos  due to the reveling taking time  as such they needed to keep the same expression for long periods of time"
ySy8mcceTno,"i disagree, slenderman is like a silent killer, whats with all the sound effects on him?"
ySy8mcceTno,"If there aint an ear raping death jumpscare, i aint watching"
ySy8mcceTno,gooood
ySy8mcceTno,"It fue una reverenda mierda , no puedo insultar este trailer sin antes ver la película."
ySy8mcceTno,heeeeeelll yeeeahhh!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Eh not really the slenderman story
ySy8mcceTno,That surprisingly doesn't look like garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,Time for like 6 mentally ill kids to start stabbing their friends...
ySy8mcceTno,Happy New Year 2012
ySy8mcceTno,I should of known it would be bad
ySy8mcceTno,This looks creepy
ySy8mcceTno,Hyped I can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,This is wild
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, guys? The boat sailed on this one a looooong time ago."
ySy8mcceTno,Hell na
ySy8mcceTno,La emoji movie de terror
ySy8mcceTno,"First emojis, now this."
ySy8mcceTno,Is slenderman just a slender man???🤔🤔🤔
ySy8mcceTno,Well well well. They finally made something that's not a homemade video
ySy8mcceTno,Making a real life mythical creature that two girls made up to kill some other girl into a film is fucked up.
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t read this
ySy8mcceTno,"OH MY GOD, TOBUSCUS FLASH BACKS!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,It's a dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,We know this is gonna be bad cause it's a movie based on a game. Nuff said. Oh wait i shouldnt have said that im gonna get so much hate for this comment.... oh well 😅
ySy8mcceTno,That trailer looks like every horror cliche ever.
ySy8mcceTno,"When I was in college choir, we went on a trip to San Diego. One of the people who went was scared of slender man, so when he went to shower, the rest of us got dressed in our black tuxes, ripped the cases off our pillows, and dressed like slender man. He opened the bathroom door, and I was standing there, waiting. He started crying hard. I grabbed him and pushed him toward the bed, and he fell and rolled to the other side off the bed where two more were waiting. He started yelling “that’s not nice!” Went and open the curtains to walk on the balcony where the final (and slenderest) man was waiting. One final scream. Ah, the good old days."
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years too late to this lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this a dead meme?
ySy8mcceTno,This better be rated R
ySy8mcceTno,That lil girl screams like a dog
ySy8mcceTno,"its gonna be pg 13, isnt it???"
ySy8mcceTno,If this doesnt have some one with a flash light finding notes im not watching.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man? Who's that again?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally this is going to probably be a great movie
ySy8mcceTno,"The concept of slender man as a movie would be really good if it followed on a more psychological, tension builder, horror like Blair Witch Project rather than some generic PG13 edgy horror movie. You're just going to get theaters filled with teens and a 10% rating."
ySy8mcceTno,Another Sony failure incoming.
ySy8mcceTno,Sylvain White also directed The Losers.. which was hugely underrated. I hope this is good. . . .
ySy8mcceTno,Channel Zero: The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Ohh noooooo
ySy8mcceTno,🎵walk through the woods🎵found a dead dollar  (2x)
ySy8mcceTno,"To those of you saying they’re late, remember that they made an Emoji movie and they are desperate"
ySy8mcceTno,I couldn't watch the trailer. Was it any good?
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks interesting regardless of it being years after the craze, don’t really care tbh"
ySy8mcceTno,oh no fucking way... this better work sony. Dont ruin this amazing horror character.
ySy8mcceTno,lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"is late, 7 years late sony"
ySy8mcceTno,0:42 if you look at the drawings they are fanart
ySy8mcceTno,"Whats with all the trending forest videos.
Logan paul, justin Timberlake and slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m confused
ySy8mcceTno,Feel the reason they didn’t make movie sooner is because of those middle school girls who actually tried to kill another classmate for slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,The emoji movie 2 the faceless one
ySy8mcceTno,*Me divierte*
ySy8mcceTno,"Hm. I hope the directors don't cave to jumpscares. Slender Man would be perfect for psychological horror, but it seems like they're gonna rely on jumpscares somewhat, which makes me sad.

Maybe I'm wrong. The imagery is beautiful, it seems competent, it definitely has the TONE of Slender Man, and importantly they intentionally decided to forgo the found footage cliche for the character. Here's hoping it truly is loyal to the lore and is more psychological than a bogstandard jumpscarefest."
ySy8mcceTno,Out of curiosity. Does the creator of slender man get anything from stuff like this?
ySy8mcceTno,Those two female killers 4yrs ago would approve this
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,How many times Hollywood will make the same story with different names!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,FINALY SLENDY HAS HIS OWN MOVIE CUZ HE WAS GETTIN MAD
ySy8mcceTno,Weak
ySy8mcceTno,Instantly disliked because this is a shitty creepypasta that should’ve died in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting so long for this...however Sony better not ruin it because they lowkey make it seem like the rings and the rings was a major letdown
ySy8mcceTno,"I would've preferred that SCP movie though. Hopefully, this will be good."
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,Looks wack af
ySy8mcceTno,Yes! I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life....(not really it’s been taking forever for this to be released) I wonder if the proxies will come out in it probably not but it will be cool to see them....
ySy8mcceTno,Yo I'm actually excited for this! This actually reminds me of Marble Hornets when Tim tells  Jay about his hospitalization in a mental institue and how he went crazy.
ySy8mcceTno,Little bit late lol
ySy8mcceTno,The Ring?
ySy8mcceTno,"*inhale* yus.
But my parents def won't let me see it."
ySy8mcceTno,Starring Logan Paul...
ySy8mcceTno,"1:52 Was that supposed to be Slender Man? Hopefully it's the lighting but that looks nothing like him, he's supposed to be a tall faceless white guy in a business suit, what is so hard to understand about that design. He just looks like a generic completely black monster here but hopefully it's only in this scene"
ySy8mcceTno,"*Espero que sea buena, porque hoy en día lo único terrorífico en las películas son sus trailers*"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really good
ySy8mcceTno,eso hubiero sido un exito total.... en el 2009
ySy8mcceTno,I think they are going to make Slender Man an alien. A grey.
ySy8mcceTno,"Perfect Timing, am I right?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Not Scary, actually gross 2.) Like 4 years late 3.) Is it not based on the game?"
ySy8mcceTno,2010 called
ySy8mcceTno,*gimme 20 dollars plays in the background*
ySy8mcceTno,"I would say late like 90 percent of comments,  but low-key im gonna watch it first chance and don't lie that you won't."
ySy8mcceTno,Should I watch this I think... NAW WAY!
ySy8mcceTno,It's 7 years late tho...
ySy8mcceTno,Sony just please if you mess this up you are done you have one shot
ySy8mcceTno,"Shocked to see they made this a movie, it's a little late but seems interesting"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this is good on movie
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,I heard Logan Paul is going to have a cameo in this.
ySy8mcceTno,For some reasone this reminds me of The Ring🤔
ySy8mcceTno,I think my mirror is more scary than this
ySy8mcceTno,Its mostly bout a girl
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been moderately relent 5 years ago...
ySy8mcceTno,Whats the point of making a trailer when you cant even show the whole body of slenderman ?
ySy8mcceTno,WTF i'm whatching!?
ySy8mcceTno,"It's from sony so it's probably another gross cash grab, but I remember when slender was a thing I really wanted there to be a movie about it
Edit/explanation: tbh I think it's good they waited so long, so it feels less about riding the hype train of 2012 and more like someone saw this old game and were like ""hey maybe I can do something with this"" 
Like my expectations are so low that I'm wierdly optimistic"
ySy8mcceTno,IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LOOOONG
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm... I don’t know how to feel.
ySy8mcceTno,Legit doe
ySy8mcceTno,poeple stopped reading creepy pasta in 2013 sorry
ySy8mcceTno,"Esta película es como el zelda Breath of the Wild de las pelis, tardo cien mil años en salir :v"
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait to watch Pewdiepie in the corner of the movie screen
ySy8mcceTno,This shouldn't be a movie.....It should be the theme of the final season of AHS!
ySy8mcceTno,Looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,Espero sea algo chido
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji Movie 2: Slendy Man's Crippling Debt
ySy8mcceTno,you're a bit late but I'm kinda hype to see this
ySy8mcceTno,"Come on Sony, you guys are better than this"
ySy8mcceTno,"Not gonna lie I’m very down for a psychological thriller/horror with slender 
If they do it right it could end up being amazing"
ySy8mcceTno,"I do kinda hope the girl at the end of the trailer is a Proxy. 

Also, yay, the reason I have paranoia is back."
ySy8mcceTno,Ooo can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,I bet it's one of those movies where slender man will show up at the last 5 minutes of the film lol.
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeeaah hate to break it to you, but Slender is kinda dead now...



and by kinda i mean very dead. Youre like 3-4 years late to this."
ySy8mcceTno,I can totally hear the gay elephant noise at 1:23 !
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,They could have made a theatrical version of slender man stabbing but nooooo
ySy8mcceTno,Ya nadie le tiene miedo y casi no se acuerdan de slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,God it’s made by Sony hope they don’t ruin this film like the others they produce 🤦‍♂️
ySy8mcceTno,Okay so this is actually happening. A lil late but okay
ySy8mcceTno,"Rated pg 13 I'm calling it now...

Also this actually could be worse than Venoms movie"
ySy8mcceTno,I Can't Wait Utill I See This Movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man, take me with your hand lead me to the shed where you murder kids."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope logan paul is in the movie to record all the dead body and act like he is sad but in the end he laughed
ySy8mcceTno,Yo I’m ready for this !!!!
ySy8mcceTno,But I love this is dope looking
ySy8mcceTno,I'm getting The Ring vibes from this
ySy8mcceTno,"Do we really need this, after that slender man murder attempt??????"
ySy8mcceTno,"Probably PG13, kids are such Pussies nowadays."
ySy8mcceTno,Lol true
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like something a film student would put out
ySy8mcceTno,2012
ySy8mcceTno,This happens when you play tooooooo much Minecraft.
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like they wanted to release this sooner, but after the Slender man Stabbing they figured they should probably wait."
ySy8mcceTno,Time to make myself into a 12 year old to actually get scared.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie has potential to be one of the first good adaptation movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man for the mcu
ySy8mcceTno,Walked In The Wood Found A Slender Man Found A Slender Man Walked In The Found A Dead Girl Found A Dead Girl
ySy8mcceTno,Movie came out 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Im confused
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 when your girl doesn’t expect it 💦
ySy8mcceTno,Haha funni
ySy8mcceTno,The game was scarier
ySy8mcceTno,"Not only is this year's too late, it looks like garbage, with absolutely 0 discerning actors!  

Here's a tip, Sony. Spamming gross images of medical procedures and bugs does not make a psychological horror scary. They have nothing to do with slender man in the slightest, so why?"
ySy8mcceTno,Lest just hope that the SCP containment breach doesn't get bought by some big-buck movie makers and ruin that too.
ySy8mcceTno,"Everything I would ask for, with this."
ySy8mcceTno,Remember a few years ago 2 young girls almost murdered their friend as a sacrifice to Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a YouTube video that can fit my iPhone x screen
ySy8mcceTno,Okay but why?
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul was the one filming the parts of the forest.
ySy8mcceTno,Relax everyone it is a comedy.
ySy8mcceTno,I like more if having more junpscares
ySy8mcceTno,😑 this should have come out a long time ago
ySy8mcceTno,Woah from a crappy looking game that turns out to be scary and fun will get its own movie
ySy8mcceTno,why now
ySy8mcceTno,"See this is why I hate creepy pastas nowadays the fans just ruin everything 
Now there making a movie talk about being late"
ySy8mcceTno,"Glad to see they finally got around to it, 5 years later."
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone got some cool water? I just burned myself on this hot garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,Pura mentira
ySy8mcceTno,Al chile
ySy8mcceTno,Sony= Internet Explorer
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I feel like this will be cancelled and replaced with the emoji movie 2...
ySy8mcceTno,2012 quiere que le devuelvan su creppypasta :v
ySy8mcceTno,this looks abysmal
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is this so late LOL
Excited"
ySy8mcceTno,Watch a person die from a copy cat killer or something from this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Indonesia also has this. It's called ""Sleding Man"""
ySy8mcceTno,Challenge: find ten comments that are not related to Logan Paul or the year 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer? Coming soon
ySy8mcceTno,Staring Logan Paul as the explorer
ySy8mcceTno,Finally bro
ySy8mcceTno,Why slender man who even plays that game anymore like if you do
ySy8mcceTno,Has anyone noticed that this is just a Stranger Things rip-off?
ySy8mcceTno,This lowkey looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Superó mis expectativas.... La verdad 👍👌
ySy8mcceTno,Who's next? Jeff The Killer??
ySy8mcceTno,I’ll see it
ySy8mcceTno,Kate the chaser?
ySy8mcceTno,Yeeeeees
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey man have you heard? People are getting killed over this Internet character called slender man, let's make a movie about him!!! What ever could go wrong?"
ySy8mcceTno,The imagery makes me think of The Ring again. Kind of over that form of filming.
ySy8mcceTno,"Did I just watch a pre-trailer trailer, for the trailer, right before the trailer???"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony still in 2012

Which makes sense considering the PS4 pro is comparable to a computer from 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,This would of been better in 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is gonna suck so hard, but I'll watch it"
ySy8mcceTno,Are you serious....
ySy8mcceTno,2012 would've been a good time to release this movie. Get with the times.
ySy8mcceTno,When I saw leaks for this like 99972829262729 years ago I thought it was fake
ySy8mcceTno,"#CanYouSeeHim
MUST. RESIST. JOHN CENA JOKE."
ySy8mcceTno,So can anyone tell me the story behind this slender man guy? Did this all come from that computer game?
ySy8mcceTno,"""#CanYouSeeHim"" #No#JesusIsWithMe"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony's Guide to Horror: ""Put some grotesque images in there and you're good"""
ySy8mcceTno,This just reminds me of some AHS trailers/teasers

15 años tarde."
ySy8mcceTno,"I knew that it was only a matter of time when *this guy* would get his own movie. A lot longer than I thought, but it finally happened."
ySy8mcceTno,It's 2018 and they're releasing it now???
ySy8mcceTno,This looks boring af
ySy8mcceTno,You want a movie like this to be good? Get the people who made silent hill. They know how to do horror.
ySy8mcceTno,Time for another potentially terrible video game adaptation movie
ySy8mcceTno,the hell is this?  needs more slenderman!
ySy8mcceTno,You guys need to leave Logan Paul alone we are all human who have made dumb mistakes. You guys need to stay in your own business. Pathetic
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks promising and better than I’d expect. I don’t see the relevance of the current lack of popularity of the creepy pasta. Why does it matter that this is “late”? While nobody shares the same complain about The Incredibles 2 for example.
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda doesn't even look like a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie: Five Nights at Freddy's
ySy8mcceTno,TBH this is lame
ySy8mcceTno,can someone just shoot me in the head because there is a actual movie of slender man 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que no arruinen este Creepypasta :'V
ySy8mcceTno,God
ySy8mcceTno,Not even scary... 😐
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora si viene lo chido xd
ySy8mcceTno,"""Geez, a Slenderman movie. I guess Hollywood really is out of ideas""

Oh, Little Kuriboh has foreseen this in 2010"
ySy8mcceTno,It isn't a Slender Man movie without face static!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh dear...
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t you guys think you’re just a *little* late on this?
ySy8mcceTno,oh dear lord....
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like im the only one who waited for this? Am I also the only one excited for it?
ySy8mcceTno,My bad I thought it said spider man
ySy8mcceTno,"I wanna say no, but this seems genuinely good."
ySy8mcceTno,Who came up with that tag line...? WTH is he supposed to be... Viral Meningitis? Viruses don’t usually get “inside your head.” What is this nonsense?! LMAO.
ySy8mcceTno,Im so exited i cant wait intell this movie comes out
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is this a movie-
I thought we got rid of this cancer like, 4 years ago."

ySy8mcceTno,Is jeff the killer next? Or Sally maybe?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like absolute garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"""The most anticipated movie of 2011"""
ySy8mcceTno,What what no way its finally happening!!
ySy8mcceTno,"What is his history
Why is he killing kids
The answer must be solved
Or he will die"
ySy8mcceTno,They have resurrected 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG I just fucking told the future that there's gonna be a Slenderman movie 2 days ago while playing slender the arrival
ySy8mcceTno,How a meme should come back.
ySy8mcceTno,The original Marble Hornets version was better.  I can already tell.
ySy8mcceTno,"It would be awesome if this trailer was just a fake out and it was about the girls who tried to murder a girl in his name, which would actually be really scary since it's a true story and it's actually possible. Like imagine the movie taking place from one of the girl's perspective's, it would be really interesting to watch this young girl slowly become obsessed and plan out a murder with another girl. It would be harsh and scary"
ySy8mcceTno,Nah... Nah... Nah... Bro wut I'm going back in time halp

ySy8mcceTno,creepy pasta meme to blockbuster gg internet
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,Another  good anime film in the year..  yeah
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,This movie came out too late ;_;
ySy8mcceTno,"One of the more cerebral horror movie trailers of recent memory. This one could have actually been a found footage / first-person movie, honestly. The video game is so effective. Why not make the movie like the game?"
ySy8mcceTno,Why is there mostly girls?
ySy8mcceTno,all I think about is the poor girl who was almost killed over slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,2011 called and wants their creepypasta back
ySy8mcceTno,"See, the thing is, if you are going to do a movie about Slenderman, a charachter made famous by an old horror game in which you are documenting yourself with a camera the whole time, and using the camera as a tool to figure out where he is because he make electronics go all crazy, you'd think the natural next step to make a movie adaptation would be to make it a found footage film, or atleast have cameras play a major role in the movie. Like maybe someone finds a bunch of tapes in the forest that reveal footage of many, many people who have been reported missing over the years. You could have even implemented the pages. Maybe he is somehow connected to the pages and if you burn them all then he goes away for a lonh time. THAT would be a compelling plot! Find and burn all of the pages before the slenderman makes you his next victim, AND you aren't allowed to look at him which would drive the audiences imaginations wild because the scariest things are the things you can't see!

But witg this, it just looks like they took a thing that was popular a few years ago and dumped out a shitty, generic horror film with little to no disernable plot of actual substance other than ""oh, hey! Heres the slenderman! He messes with your head because thats toatally how he does stuff! Yeah! We didn't any research on him at all!"""
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey sony, here I give you a better opening plot, how about the slenderman is just an internet creepy pasta myth back from 5-6 years ago and no one believes it, then... someone noticed that those who ever wrote the story about him on the internet are always ended up missing or died in a freak accident"
ySy8mcceTno,striking while the iron is hot i see
ySy8mcceTno,I thought that this was one of Nigahiga’s spoof trailers
ySy8mcceTno,De la verga pinche triler>:v
ySy8mcceTno,Boring man
ySy8mcceTno,"So of course when he is not at all a relevant or popular topic, their making a movie on him. Yeah okay"
ySy8mcceTno,Not funny people.
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul reuploaded the vlog I see
ySy8mcceTno,Beware of the Logan Paul jokes in here comment browser.

ySy8mcceTno,"Hate when people choose directors who really don't put a lot of effort in the story and forklore, and plus the company who really are for the money. Feel that this movie is gonna fail hard..."
ySy8mcceTno,Boi dis look fanmade

ySy8mcceTno,Is there a Logan Paul DLC for this?
ySy8mcceTno,the IT of 2018 !?
ySy8mcceTno,But Are They Gonna Finally Give Us A Backstory On Slender?
ySy8mcceTno,Yessxsssssss I'm ready. Give it to me
ySy8mcceTno,They showed the entire trailer in the first few seconds lmfao
ySy8mcceTno,This isn't  as appealing  to me as I thought  it would  be
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this was a missed opportunity they could have made it found footage like in the game it would be cool to be in the theater watching and the camera goes static
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally! A Minecraft movi--

Oh."
ySy8mcceTno,About time they made a slenderman movie!
ySy8mcceTno,I really hope this movie will be good...
ySy8mcceTno,looks awful. haHAA
ySy8mcceTno,Why the hate? The movie doesn't look to bad. It looks pretty interesting and I'm excited to see how they portray Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,"A little late, but I will still watch it"
ySy8mcceTno,In 2010 the it trailer was released and then was released in 2009

ySy8mcceTno,"Good job, Screen Gems and Sony, you took a unique concept and turned it into generic bullshit. I'll stick with Marble Hornets, kthxbai"
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like it'd be cooler if it were a found footage film. Say what you will about ff but it'd be closer to the game.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,Why make this now instead of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,0:59 When you walk around the corner in PUBG and there's an enemy right there

ySy8mcceTno,I honestly never understand why it's a perfect time to throw a horror film in the holidays. This Christmas..... celebrate the holidays with a good scare! INSIDIOUS! >_> The hell is wrong with this world? Make more holiday related movies please.... on the correct holidays.
ySy8mcceTno,It's about fucking time someone made a real slender movie
ySy8mcceTno,"They should make an entire creepy pasta universe
Next up...
Herobrine
Edit:yes it’s a joke"
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks good, however did they read ANY creepypasta???"
ySy8mcceTno,"Actually don't look half bad, never make a final decision based off a trailer (but yes the emoji movie was cancer)"
ySy8mcceTno,Some say if you look real close in the forest you can see Logan Paul filming a dead body
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, your better off just dropping this on Netflix"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks trash.
ySy8mcceTno,I just clicked on this trailer to see the comments
ySy8mcceTno,3RD GRADE ME IS QUAKING
ySy8mcceTno,"A bit late for the train, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,"I always kinda wanted a Slenderman movie, but this looks like an edgy teen playing with their moms camera"

ySy8mcceTno,This isn't late or anything...

ySy8mcceTno,First indie game/creepypasta to have a movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I wonder if they'll have a thing referenceing the two girls who stabbed another girl in the woods that were ""doing it for Slenderman"""
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like the horror move Gabe showed at the Halloween party in the office
ySy8mcceTno,I’m seeing a huge flaw here. A trailer with barley any dialogue played throughout the trailer😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Cheap producers and directors cannot come with a ""scary movie"" unless they have messed up music, sudden camera changes, loud noises and erratic focusing. Barely no one has the art of coming up with a psychological thriller capable of chilling your spine by using common situations. Always has to be a stupid deformed monster in the shadows."
ySy8mcceTno,"There’s no was you can make this movie not scary, it’s slender man ffs."
ySy8mcceTno,Ah hell....this just got real!!!😮😮
ySy8mcceTno,Little Kuriboh warned us this would happen.
ySy8mcceTno,"A little late, guys"
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff The Killer is better
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been something to hype over if creepypasta was still relevant

ySy8mcceTno,Logan ruined this movie cause now everybody is talking about logan Paul and the suicide forest
ySy8mcceTno,What does this have to do with slenderman lol
ySy8mcceTno,Eu esperava mais.
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if the person who created the slender man ever got money or credit.
ySy8mcceTno,Where's James Wan?!
ySy8mcceTno,“We found a dead body in the Japanese suicide Forest”
ySy8mcceTno,I wander if they'll add Jeff the Killer or a reference to him because that little girl near the end of the trailer looks a bit like Sally from another Creepypasta.

Encima porque no tiene nada que ver con slenderman de seguro solo vieron que era algo famoso, un par de imágenes y listo sin pensarlo mucho ya esta la nueva película de slenderman que de slenderman solo es tiene el nombre y el bosque 

Esto tiene pinta de mierda de película.

Pero si hay una mínima posibilidad de que salga bien, me comeré mis palabras y admitire mi error pero yo pienso que sera una basura porque 

En que momento en la historia de slenderman tienes que escribir ""HIM"" en un espejo.

SLENDERMAN HABLANDO TAMBIÉN DEL JUEGO NO SOLO DE LA CREEPYPASTA ES DE RECOLECTAR NOTAS EN UN BOSQUE, RAPTA PERSONAS EN SU MAYORÍA NIÑOS, ARRUINA APARATOS ELECTRÓNICOS AL ACERCARSE PERO NO POSEE CUERPOS NO INVOCA GUSANOS 

O NO SE SI ESTARÉ YO DESINFORMADO PERO LA PELICULA HUELE A MALA DESDE YA

Y hablando mas del juego y como pudieron haber hecho la película, tan simple era que poner a 5 chavales que van a investigar porque hay muchas desapariciones en un bosque, se escucha y se ve a slenderman de fondo, al rato desaparece uno, los demás van encontrando notas de personas que trataron de escapar de slenderman y después ya al final de la película son los demás chavales huyendo de él, tropezando etc y SLENDERMAN con sus tentáculos los rapta a todos o uno se salva, y ya tienes tu película de 1:00:00 y fiel al juego"

ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,people have murdered in real life to please this slender guy so this gotta be good

and Slenderman The Arrival is Scarier than this"
ySy8mcceTno,Since when did Hollywood start making movies about Internet legends?
ySy8mcceTno,"Que puta mierda, se nota desde lejos que este intento de película va a ser una de las peores cosas jamás hechas, no tiene nada que ver con Slenderman, se nota demasiado que solo pusieron su nombre en el titulo para llamar la atención, eso en el 2012 quizá hubiera funcionado, pero hoy en día Slenderman ya no es ni la sombra de lo que fue, ojala y lo dejaran morir de una buena vez."

ySy8mcceTno,I swear if it starts out as a blond guy going inside a forest with a vlog camera..... wait a minute
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets should've made this.

ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,If slender man is a movie then enderman should be a movie too

ySy8mcceTno,Bro they can do better show more slendy
ySy8mcceTno,"*One of the executives of Sony when they decided to make this:*
Wait, an animated movie about emojis wasn't enough?
 Oh, I know! Let's make a movie about 6 years old dead meme wich nobody remembers until now and instead of be a little bit faithful to the original story, it will use all the crappy cliches of horror films and it  will also abuse of jumpscares and screamers instead of create a real fear atmosphere, like all the horror movies nowdays. I'm really sure it will be a great success, because we are the best company in the world...right?"
ySy8mcceTno,This is stupid he doesnt get inside your head he watches the back of your head or if your looking at him the screen starts to static should had a guy holding a camera or video recorder😒
ySy8mcceTno,that's gonna be awesome!
ySy8mcceTno,I love the creepypasta fandom! I wanna watch this so bad now! But if it's bad I wasted my money for no reason...
ySy8mcceTno,SONY is going downhill
ySy8mcceTno,2018 already lookin shitty
ySy8mcceTno,😱
ySy8mcceTno,This...is going...to suuuuuck
ySy8mcceTno,omg. NO DELETE THIS MOVIE.
ySy8mcceTno,*THIS MOVIE WILL FLOP*
ySy8mcceTno,This is a horribly misguided idea
ySy8mcceTno,espero que Slenderman no sea negro en la película
ySy8mcceTno,My early 2000s-ness is screaming I must see this. Im being unironic when I say I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,This is way too late
ySy8mcceTno,I read Spider-Man
ySy8mcceTno,So what if there's a new Slenderman game based off of this movie and then all the youtubers play it and oh my god I don't want to be in 2012 again
ySy8mcceTno,so much for sleep
ySy8mcceTno,"I can’t wait until they reboot this movie 3 years from now just after they finish the sequel! It’ll be called...

😱 Slender Person🌈"
ySy8mcceTno,White Supremacist working to maintain white supremacy 24/7 just like Resident Evil 7 having a black cop just to be brutally murdered here they let you see in the trailer a black person is going to die brutally as well. They'll keep you in real life as well as fictional worlds.
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s Jason’s  Movies?!
ySy8mcceTno,Shouldve made this in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"anyone else thinks this isn't adaptful to the creepypasta, I mean I rather watch logan paul find a lake of dead bodies"
ySy8mcceTno,Yay creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,That was one of the most annoying previews I have ever seen
ySy8mcceTno,*Tall faceless boi out here making little kids go crazy*
ySy8mcceTno,Sony: Lets make a movie about some dude that was scary in 2012!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks pretty weird...its a good idea for a movie but it just seems weird...
I would prefer a five nights at Freddy movie however.. starring harrison ford as the night shift worker. BTW"
ySy8mcceTno,"Mira Este Video 👇
https://youtu.be/kDQbu0BFBsE"
ySy8mcceTno,...... Ft. Logan paul
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait to make some bottom text memes abou this guy
ySy8mcceTno,"I honestly am looking forward to seeing this, but I really hope this movie is not another ""Bye Bye Man movie disaster or it's something like The Emoji Movie since this is being made by Sony. Slender man is what got me into a fascination of horror along with other Creepypasta stories. It'll be nice to see them finally up on the big screen. Like I said, I just hope this movie doesn't turn out to be complete garbage."
ySy8mcceTno,Release date of d movie
ySy8mcceTno,i thought it said spiderman😐
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,This seems like it was made by edgy 14 year Olds.
ySy8mcceTno,I swear So y if this movie is absolute horseshit I will hunt down EVERY SINGLE PERSON that worked on this movie and kill them
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this was coming
ySy8mcceTno,you know this would be kinda interesting....if it didnt come from a game.
ySy8mcceTno,Couldn’t possibly be scarier than the marble hornets stuff
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta cinematic universe? CCU?
ySy8mcceTno,Can we do away with the gay little mini trailers that play before the actual trailers? Thanks.
ySy8mcceTno,About time they make this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope they actually incorporate some lore from the original stories. (Once you start seeing him it’s too late, etc.). But they probably wont"
ySy8mcceTno,5 años tarde
ySy8mcceTno,Hold up wait a minute... .
ySy8mcceTno,have you all forgotten that there are already are TWO slender man movies???!!!??they may not be made by big companies but they exist!! srsly go look up slender man and windigo on youtube
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man OMG OMG this is epic 🙊🙊🙊 2018 wiiii yeah yeah yeah
ySy8mcceTno,Assuming at first this was the Slender Man movie connected to Conjuring..I was wrong.
ySy8mcceTno,YOOOOOO IT'S TIME!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Now all we need is Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,“we found a de-faceless man in the Japanese suicide forest”
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time they make a movie!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is making this huh.....jumanji....ghostbusters....emoji movie.... yea not looking forward to this one bit.
ySy8mcceTno,What the h@l is this
ySy8mcceTno,First I'll see Insidious: The Last Key then I'll watch this next OH-K
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow it’s just like Dark Souls I mean the movie, It."
ySy8mcceTno,;v
ySy8mcceTno,This is a bit EDGEY because slender man used to be a big part of my childhood
ySy8mcceTno,Where's the static sound?
ySy8mcceTno,How can you try to tell a story about something that is specifically scary because it has NO story. It just doesn’t make sense
ySy8mcceTno,The guy with the pink R on his white shirt at 2:50 reminds me of Bboy Physics what is his name?
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there not doing it to get a quick cash grab but honestly this is the company that made the emoji movie so don't get your hopes up.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome finally a movie and now I'm both scared and hyped #Canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Really sony first emoji movie and now this
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted this back in 2013 lmao.. I’m still gonna give it a shot
ySy8mcceTno,This HAS to be so bad it's good or why would you even watch this.
ySy8mcceTno,IDEK
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, kinda disappointed with what I already saw. Images and shots shown were more of shock factor than scare factor, which doesn't do much to most horror movie viewers. 

The use of screaming was a little overused. Yes, Slenderman is supposed to drive you insane, but tone it down just a tad bit, and it'll be fine. 

But besides that, okay. The movie better do my favourite urban legend justice."
ySy8mcceTno,This is either gonna be ok or trash
ySy8mcceTno,Will Logan Paul be in the movie recording all the dead people found?
ySy8mcceTno,i have crippling depression ._.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,Why the he'll did they make a slender man movie he's scary already
ySy8mcceTno,"For all those people who are hating on this movie for the 2014 attempted murder in Wisconsin, remember this... the game came out in 2009, the only evidence tied to the game and the attack was testimonies from 2 deranged girls and recreations of the notes from the game drawn by the monsters. To me this seems like the family of the victim is trying to get a quick settlement from sony about a 4 year old crime that had nothing to do with the story of a FICTIONAL CHARACTER!!!! this movie looks entertaining and scary and is based off of the lore and games not the 2014 attack. Long story short ITS JUST A MOVIE YOU OVERLY SENSITIVE PRICKS!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao you're only gonna see 8 mins of slender Man like they did in the new Godzilla movie😂
ySy8mcceTno,Intense
ySy8mcceTno,Uh this has nothing to do with the slender man games...... Kindof disappointed
ySy8mcceTno,I only clicked on this cuz I thought it said Spider-Man 😂
ySy8mcceTno,2020: jeff the Killer. The movie
ySy8mcceTno,It’s been years since Slenderman has been relevant
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman gang nam style
ySy8mcceTno,É de arrepiar o Slenderman!
ySy8mcceTno,Starring Jake Paul ...
ySy8mcceTno,You're like at least 4 years late on this
ySy8mcceTno,This should be number one trending instead of that Logan Paul video like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,Soooo does this movie have a plot line... Orrrrr.... 🤔
ySy8mcceTno,2012 no esta orgulloso de esto
ySy8mcceTno,Give me $20 give me $20 give me $20
ySy8mcceTno,not impressed at all
ySy8mcceTno,nNOONONONONONONONONONONONOONONONONONONONONONONONOBONONONOBOBOBOBONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONOONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONON
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,I can just tell this is going to be a bad movie. I will look up the reviews first but this looks the it has all the makings of a bad video game movie.
ySy8mcceTno,For some reason the trailer for this make me confused than scared.
ySy8mcceTno,Do you know how long I've been waiting for this movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Anybody that says that says this seriously :

*rawr* XD

  —is going to see watch this, this year"
ySy8mcceTno,I still think the emoji movie is more disturbing than this...
ySy8mcceTno,Ok. What else is next? Five Nights at Freddy’s? Wait a minute................not bad for a movie though..............
ySy8mcceTno,"You gotta be rickrolling me, Slendy."
ySy8mcceTno,would’ve actually gotten scared and liked this 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,The hell...
ySy8mcceTno,dear god PLEASE DONT RUIN SLENDER MAN FOR ME!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This should've came out like 5 years ago when the game was popular.......
ySy8mcceTno,I guess they don’t learn from making games into movies
ySy8mcceTno,"Just like with any other “horror” movie, I have low expectations. I hope to be proven wrong."
ySy8mcceTno,Jumpscare the Movie
ySy8mcceTno,#iveseenhim
ySy8mcceTno,why dose this need to exist....did anyone ask...is it 2012 and my computer date is wrong? idk.
ySy8mcceTno,Took em long enough
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t tell me it’s gonna be $20.00 per admission
ySy8mcceTno,Movimiento naranja....
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t some be die in real life regarding this story?
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG! DIS BETTER BE GOOD!
ySy8mcceTno,"3 years too late, just like the angry birds movie. Come on sony."
ySy8mcceTno,"Always wanted a movie based on Slender-Man. If you cypher out all the cringey creepy pastas you can find some gold just waiting to be turned into a movie, and I think Slender-Man works really well. Hopefully this is good, however this looks super generic."
ySy8mcceTno,whY
ySy8mcceTno,"Way Too Late Sony, 4 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,"Creí que estábamos en 2018, no en 2013"
ySy8mcceTno,Why are people hating on a pathological horror movie? Mad cuz they don't show slender alp the time? Well thats how his character was made. This isn't a horror thriller movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Warning: Oh so mamy, many, scares!"
ySy8mcceTno,"1:47 I low key did not realize he was standing right by her. But I feel like this is doing to much, this could have been some creepy Blair witch/ suicide Forest type movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Un poco tarde la película, en estos tiempos ya no da miedo"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks alright
ySy8mcceTno,Took you long enough
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of Gabe’s “Cinema of the Unsettling” movie he showed at the Halloween Party in “The Office”.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man should be on Channel Zero series. Season 2 was a very disappointment 👎
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh what’s next a Jack The Killer Movie😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie. Five nights at Freddies
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man Proably Won't Show Up Untill End Of Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Aw this is cool
ySy8mcceTno,So when's Slenderman 2 coming out? Or the emoji movie 2? Where are your PRIORITIES SONY!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of the ring.
ySy8mcceTno,Is it to late for a Logan Paul joke?
ySy8mcceTno,"1/10
The trailer has no video static or white noise."
ySy8mcceTno,"I pray they do "" shadow people"""
ySy8mcceTno,This looks painfully generic. It's never going to get close to Marble Hornets or any of the other Slender Man productions.
ySy8mcceTno,"1:26 Thank you Logan Paul
For doing all of us a favor"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like another sub mediocre movie
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for venom trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie nobody asked for but got anyway, thanks Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,I just hope its good.
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when slender man was a thing
ySy8mcceTno,How many pedophiles had to rape to make this movie now?
ySy8mcceTno,2014 demands its creepypasta back
ySy8mcceTno,Watch the new Mario kart this year😂
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty bad. Not gonna lie. But most of all I think the trailer was lazily made. I talk about it in my new video.
ySy8mcceTno,too late
ySy8mcceTno,I REALLY wanna be on board with this. But we all know it's probably gonna be an overly edgy trash-fest like Deathnote 2017.
ySy8mcceTno,Hope there's a cameo of the two girls who stabbed another girl in his name
ySy8mcceTno,"A internet sensation goes on the big screen, wow"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m soooo watching this
ySy8mcceTno,a mi punto se me hace q estara aburrida D: para ser el trailer no me quiero imaginar mmm ojala no sea asi
ySy8mcceTno,Me aburrio el trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"This is fake
1.  The real film is meant to have Kurt Russell as Jonathan the Gay Elephant
2.  Needs more explosions...and dead children.
Although I give the creators props for using a gay elephant noise at 1:23"
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDERMAN ISNT SCARY PPL HE IS A CUTE INTERNET MEME
ySy8mcceTno,"Next thing you know there is gonna be a smile dog and a Jeff the killer, and um uh hmm"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is about 6 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,"Whether it's bad or not, the fact that it got it's own movie is pretty cool."
ySy8mcceTno,"It's okay, I watched Marble Hornets, I don't need to see this."
ySy8mcceTno,Not a smart move after an innocent girl was nearly stabbed to death bc of this lore
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Great another horror film based on something I like now I have to see it and be scared out of my mind thanks a lot Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy, I feel like it's one of those ""edgy"" horror films with boring jumpscares, lacking of suspense and etc."
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm actually confused. I thought Slenderman's whole thing was that he'd kill and mutilate you and hang your innards on on tree branches. This whole, he ""infects"" you with science experiment stock footage and makes you ""the happening"" yourself, seems way off. I was never too into the slender craze though, so maybe I'm completely wrong"
ySy8mcceTno,🤯
ySy8mcceTno,I swear to god every 10 year old is gonna be so hyped! XD
ySy8mcceTno,"yes. YES YES YES YES YES

they better add the creepy notes"
ySy8mcceTno,"When you read a bunch of fanfiction about slendy being a push over brother or over protective father

I can’t see him as anything else other than a good father constantly complaining that his daughter is leaving there toys around"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,What is the point of this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks amazing but it really scared me
ySy8mcceTno,I didn't think they'd make a movie out of this
ySy8mcceTno,The Most-Anticipated Movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"Where’s mah boi, BlumHouse Productions?"
ySy8mcceTno,2011 called; they want their film idea back.
ySy8mcceTno,YES
ySy8mcceTno,Esta pelicula debio llegar bace como 5 años.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim... Isn't that supposed to be John Cena's biopic movie tag line?
ySy8mcceTno,garbo definitely but for that sweet sweet gaming community nostalgia...
ySy8mcceTno,a nu ma se más o menos
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it said Spiderman :(
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey Sony, 2012 calls, he wants his slendy man back"
ySy8mcceTno,1:32 Annie is that u?
ySy8mcceTno,Took you guys like 15 years to make this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,if this doesn't end up being rated R we riot!
ySy8mcceTno,little bit late...
ySy8mcceTno,that boy slender
ySy8mcceTno,Why not just call it Suicide the movie
ySy8mcceTno,What I only know is Mr. Slendy is just a skinny tall man who teleports everywhere
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks and sounds horrible. I'll give it a chance.
ySy8mcceTno,7 years late sony
ySy8mcceTno,Crazy Russian Hacker is the only YouTuber who hasn’t changed after fame
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is so outdated that Smosh called it outdated in 2014
ySy8mcceTno,I'm on a diet and this video was not what I thought it was :(
ySy8mcceTno,"Why I'm disappointed w/ this trailer:

1) Too much hospital, not enough forest.

2) It's called ""Slender-Man,"" not ""Slender.""

3) Too much human, not enough Slender.

4) Too much cliche creepy girl, not enough Slender.

5) Too much magical demon crap, not enough dapperly-dressed Slender.

6) Only shot of Slender standing in forest is immediately followed by Slender MOVING for a cheap jumpscare.

7) Too much 'intense' imagery, and not one video camera.

Why is the one horror movie I genuinely wanted to see happen turning out to be another suck-fest?"
ySy8mcceTno,Huh? I thought this already happened..
ySy8mcceTno,Would be good if it came out when Slenderman was relevant
ySy8mcceTno,All of the 12 year olds are going to be happy
ySy8mcceTno,"""He's just standing there... MENACINGLY!"""
ySy8mcceTno,I was expecting a Jeff the killer movie first though.
ySy8mcceTno,This is the most demonic trailer I have ever seen but it's good
ySy8mcceTno,#CANYOUSEEHIM
ySy8mcceTno,"You don't even need to know what the movies called, what its about, or see the trailer to know its bad. You only need to know Sony is making it to know its bad."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh sorry i forgot to get scared:).....
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully I'm in the movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Let's wait till that make a Five Nights at Freddy's movie or a creepy pasta expanded universe.
ySy8mcceTno,In 2020 they are going to release the film of Clash of Clans :V
ySy8mcceTno,This WILL be terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie going to suck so bad
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is long overdue
Is slender man still relevant"
ySy8mcceTno,"I get that films take a long time to make but as far as I can tell this isn’t scary and i’m a chicken when it comes to scary movies. It just feels a little blah, generic even."
ySy8mcceTno,Im allready hating this
ySy8mcceTno,I NEED THIS
ySy8mcceTno,What’s with all “the woods” videos in trending?
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how many emo middle schoolers are going to be in the theaters.
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch this so oo oo baaad!!! Is this going to be a real movie?!?! Please tell me yes!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn't look that good, but i'm still gonna watch anyway.."
ySy8mcceTno,Weres a bat full of nails when you need on
ySy8mcceTno,WTH...
ySy8mcceTno,Demogorgon vibes
ySy8mcceTno,There is already a slender man movie its called always watching
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,God I hope they don't ruin this one like they did with Always Watching
ySy8mcceTno,i want to die right now
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie actually would be better served it kinda recreated the stabbing a couple years back where the girls claimed slender man told them to do it. And slenderman would still be seen in the movie because the story could be told through one of the girl's perspective. The fact that she sees slenderman would be because of her schizophrenia (which is the actual reason in real life), which can also serve as a way for the movie to discuss problems with mental illness. But from what this trailer shows, this movie should be your standard horror movie fare."
ySy8mcceTno,What’s the plot? Someone tell me
ySy8mcceTno,Wow. A movie trailer about Slender man which has nothing to do with Slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, I didn't think anyone would actually make this."
ySy8mcceTno,1:15 me on the bus when the windows are foggy
ySy8mcceTno,Looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,nope
ySy8mcceTno,The Bye Bye Man 2 looks weird and worse.
ySy8mcceTno,Another video game that movies are gonna ruin.
ySy8mcceTno,Marble horrnets return?
ySy8mcceTno,2013 pewdiepie video
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope we see the proxy soon you know hoodie,masky,and ticci Toby"
ySy8mcceTno,I saw slenderman in my pants
ySy8mcceTno,Thought it said spiderman😩😩😩
ySy8mcceTno,One of the only trailers that doesn't spoil the whole plot of its movie and basically show its ending. 👍
ySy8mcceTno,Its Hot Topic the Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait for a fnaf movie come on (made 3 books) (made 6 GAMES) (???movie???) By the way coming 2026 look out for that.
ySy8mcceTno,Shouldn't have this come out like 9 years ago like wtf
ySy8mcceTno,eh...........sony the toilet of movie companies
ySy8mcceTno,Why make a movie where closing your eyes solves the entire problem :D solved.
ySy8mcceTno,"the trailer dosnt even. feel like slender man it felt like a other typical horror movie..

also i forgot that slender man exsist"
ySy8mcceTno,I was literally watching Slender Gameplays for the first time in 2 years. What a fucking coincidence!
ySy8mcceTno,slender man does not go into buildings so they got that wrong
ySy8mcceTno,slender man does not go into buildings so they got that wrong

ySy8mcceTno,This is kinda like stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,All the movies you could have made you make fucking slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly disappointed with this
ySy8mcceTno,THIS IS REAL?!!??
ySy8mcceTno,Tengo q verla tengo q verla

ySy8mcceTno,"Good idea, bad company making it."
ySy8mcceTno,2014 tells to give him back his trailer :v
ySy8mcceTno,So.......... Who wants to come with me to make sure I don’t do any of this afterwards?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it has nothing to do with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This is trash sadly
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is a blender and sender and mender
ySy8mcceTno,A slender man movie never crossed my mind but now that I’ve seen this trailer I need this movie literally right now.
ySy8mcceTno,Yer lookinslender
ySy8mcceTno,Knowing that this movie is going to made by Sony I already know it's going to be shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,The hero we needed.
ySy8mcceTno,When we all forgot about slender man and a movie is about to come to the big screen
ySy8mcceTno,Oh man this is gonna be great
ySy8mcceTno,Fuckin’ nasty grubby worms... yuck 🤢
ySy8mcceTno,WE WANT VENOM!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,hopefully logan paul isnt there to capture the moment with his camera and only blur out hte face
ySy8mcceTno,"This will either be a subtle horror movie with psychological buildup and characters cracking under pressure, or a cheap jumpscare fest. Probably the latter"
ySy8mcceTno,Watch out ever one it's Logan Paul in the woods.

ySy8mcceTno,Swaadsffgdfdf
ySy8mcceTno,"I really, REALLY want this to be good! But I fear it’s not going to. If it does do good, please do Jeff the Killer 🙏🏽"
ySy8mcceTno,It has Begun! Creepy Pasta Cinemas
ySy8mcceTno,"Ahhhhg por fin,  van a sacar la película de uno de mis asesinos favoritos!!!!!!  Pero me sigo quedando con JEFF THE KILLER en el primer puesto."
ySy8mcceTno,So The Ring part 4?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a really bad movie
ySy8mcceTno,The best thing about this is the palpable sarcasm in these comments.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh shid waddup
ySy8mcceTno,"Its the moment we all feared, 2008 has returned..."
ySy8mcceTno,Scp containment breach movie pls
ySy8mcceTno,This is like... 7 years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,Perfect as a comedy and I doubt any homage to tribe 12 everyman or marble hornets in the movie and slender man making ooga booga fingers is perfect
ySy8mcceTno,YESSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,"Walked in the woods, found a dead body found a dead body in the woods"
ySy8mcceTno,Shoulda made this 6-10 years ago when he was still relevant.
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, now i just need the raker, Herobrine, and much more.... hahahah"
ySy8mcceTno,Well it looks alright we need more SLENDERMAN
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this will be good
ySy8mcceTno,"Can you see him?
No because he's a Spooky Spaghetti and not real."
ySy8mcceTno,"AL FIN ALV, lo había estado esperando ya desde hace mucho 😍😍😍❤️"
ySy8mcceTno,Say what u want... This will be as good as It. This trailer gave me chills.
ySy8mcceTno,What year is this? 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this
ySy8mcceTno,"BTW the trailer give us an inaccurate idea of what the slenderman is (which only shows him for 2 sec)
And instead gives us another cheap and cliche garbage horror movie trailer and not to mention they got his ability wrong making him look like a mummy and some dust cloud 



And they forgot the most basic thing
The notes and my god they don't show the


STATIC
it's unspeakable 


Imagine that they make a story about you (someone unique(and you are very well known to a group of people and then they take you to China where teenagers there lived a total different lifestyle from yours)) and they make you look like any other Chinese boi, 
It's disrespectful"
ySy8mcceTno,yES!!!!! I'm so happy!!!!!! Thank you lord!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"We're making movies out of creepy pastas now?  Come on hollywood, wtf are you doing?"
ySy8mcceTno,"It's like I make a meme movie called shooting stars and the trailer is Rick Roll saying my name is Jeff goteeem while playing All-star while showing nothing but 2008 memes and playing feminist trying to be a communist while they have no knowledge of it other than the fact that they all got payed the same amount, but they don't know that sjw and gay people were sent to gulags (concentration camps) and they where payed loafs of bread"
ySy8mcceTno,I saw him
ySy8mcceTno,2020 Minecraft ai conspiracy
ySy8mcceTno,"""We found a Dead body in the Japanese Suicide Forest..."""
ySy8mcceTno,NOOOOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,Next time is minecraft survival mode the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I thought I said Spider-Man and I got exited for nothing
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if keemstars in the woods to
ySy8mcceTno,Congratulations Sony for being 5 years late to the slender man craze.
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for The Yahtzee movie! Ooh ooh and The Roblox Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,But why?
ySy8mcceTno,"You were so caught up with weather you could, you never bothered to wonder if you should."
ySy8mcceTno,honey nooo...
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t help but feel a little awkward about this since there was that real case about those 2 girls that stabbed another girl for slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,2:06 I never knew Slender was into body snatching these days. :/
ySy8mcceTno,"LOOKS LIKE THE...





""SUICIDE FOREST"" -LOGAN PAUL"
ySy8mcceTno,Man...we would have loved this movie back in 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,"Not gonna lie, this looks like crap"
ySy8mcceTno,"Everybody knows, you don’t fuckin look away from slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is a couple years too late
ySy8mcceTno,im actually scared that this movie will cause the rebirth of the creepypasta fandom
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, only half a fucking decade late!"
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things + it = slender Man the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Like si crees que este sera el trailer mas malo del siglo :v
ySy8mcceTno,"He protecc
He attac
But most importanly
*He makes kids' necks CRACC*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Can we just not, like can we not right now."
ySy8mcceTno,Ni miedo da
ySy8mcceTno,"Well it’s official, I’m going to shoot myself"
ySy8mcceTno,"While Slender Man can definitely work as a movie, this definitely looks generic. Creepy long haired girls, maggots, little girls being the focus, wiggling door handle, etc. Etc."
ySy8mcceTno,Well hopefully Spiderverse will be good.
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s Minecraft the Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,It's just a prank bro
ySy8mcceTno,Where can I read the fanfic associated with the trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,Yes yes finally my wish Came true
ySy8mcceTno,man is it 2011 again?
ySy8mcceTno,It would have been better if the movie was like the game and it told us the origins of the notes
ySy8mcceTno,This actually seems a lot more promising than the Marble Hornets movie.
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,Hį
ySy8mcceTno,The new lego batman trailer is   n 0 1c 3  .
ySy8mcceTno,We know it might be bad but we also know we might see it for the lolz
ySy8mcceTno,6 Years late
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul would fit great into this movie by being one of the suicide victims that hanged themselves in the woods!👍
ySy8mcceTno,someone should have done this a long time ago
ySy8mcceTno,"How much you wanna bet this is gonna suck, every movie based on a video game sucks, except Wreck it Ralph and Mortal Kombat(the first one)"
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Do a Half-Life Movie Trilogy but don’t release the third one
ySy8mcceTno,"It's way too late to release this, but you'll watch it anyways."
ySy8mcceTno,yoooooooo cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,Lol thought is said spider man
ySy8mcceTno,I hope to break 100k amazing subscribers mark this year which will be tough :/
ySy8mcceTno,Whaaaa?? I wanna see this
ySy8mcceTno,I got more disturbed by the sharpie screeching noise than the slender man :|
ySy8mcceTno,I legit predicted this and said in 2018
ySy8mcceTno,"How many of you guys want to bet this is setting up a Creepypasta cinematic universe?

Anticipate Jeff the Killer the movie in a year or two."
ySy8mcceTno,"Few years too late. Still, it's kind of cool how they seem to be focusing on the whole ""slendersickness"" aspect of the creepypasta, in my opinion. Hopefully, it'll be good, or at least interesting."
ySy8mcceTno,Next move is Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,lanky boi
ySy8mcceTno,Sooo am I he only person that has been waiting for this movie for over 5 years ??
ySy8mcceTno,So this is not about the 2 girls who tried to kill a 3rd girl.
ySy8mcceTno,Wtaf did I just watch
ySy8mcceTno,Get ready for the fidget spinner movie y’all
ySy8mcceTno,where was this 5 years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,No mamen empezó como crepypasta y terminó como película que cool 😎
ySy8mcceTno,Justo hoy termine con mi novia estaba muy triste y vi el tráiler y me puse muy feliz :'D
ySy8mcceTno,aka emojji movie 2
ySy8mcceTno,"I like the topic, and think it truly could make a good movie but the trailer has me a bit concerned? It felt to me all over the place and left me totally confused.  I felt no synchronicity or story? I get that it was a trailer, but I usually am left with some idea of what the movie will be about. This almost just seemed like random images thrown together?"
ySy8mcceTno,Happy New Years it’s 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Plot twist, Slenderman is Paul Blart"
ySy8mcceTno,"What’s next, Herobrine the movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,Someone needs to call the Winchesters!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all are years late on the Slenderman hype train.
ySy8mcceTno,has potential but definitely doesn’t look scary at all :/
ySy8mcceTno,*!!!ESKETIT!!!*
ySy8mcceTno,"Guess what Logan Paul filmed this movie 
WHaaaaaaaaaaaat........(0o0)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, boy."
ySy8mcceTno,Im not even suprised no more what next the minecraft movie ??
ySy8mcceTno,Creo que esto era para el 2012 :v
ySy8mcceTno,*Gay elephant noise*
ySy8mcceTno,Sony movie? Im out
ySy8mcceTno,seguro lo estropearan como godzila solo pasaran al hombre flaco unas cuantas escenas
ySy8mcceTno,I love when YouTube gives me an ad for the thing I'm about to watch....
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one laughing at how bad this is?
ySy8mcceTno,gayyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Nice. Pre-ordering the Blu-ray.
ySy8mcceTno,Satanic!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I was like, there's no way this would be... Oh ok... Slendyboy in 4K"
ySy8mcceTno,"A little late, man."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"This probably doesn’t even have to do with anything in the game, except slender himself"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender mon
ySy8mcceTno,Is this based on the story of the two girls who attempted to kill their friend for the Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,I like the way peanut butter tastes.
ySy8mcceTno,Hes killing kids cause he watched the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Man Slenderman became very popular now
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone see him in the treler
ySy8mcceTno,Mejor la historia de jeff the killer 
ySy8mcceTno,Man this new slender man game has some nice graphics
ySy8mcceTno,SODYPOPE THE DOGE
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be really good
ySy8mcceTno,Only Sony could be so shameless to make a movie about a flash game where you run around in dark forest picking up pieces of paper and avoiding an un-animated mannequin in a suit
ySy8mcceTno,The hottest movie of 2011 comin at ya.
ySy8mcceTno,"I know it’s late, but I’m excited! Hopefully it won’t cause any other girls to stab their friends."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, a film based off an internet created boogeyman"
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly this should not even bother coming out bcoz literally its just madness we have people still think the creature is real wen truly its just a made up character that spread on the interweb its just going to make people more scared of a fictional character
ySy8mcceTno,"Good news is Slendys creator Victor helped write the movie. So if it's anyone who can get Slender man right, it's him"
ySy8mcceTno,si la película no la doblan con puro loquendo en latinoamerica que no tendrá chiste
ySy8mcceTno,Finally !!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Omfg! I want to watch it! Has the writer of the slenderman creepypasta seen this yet!?
ySy8mcceTno,Spo0pY
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is Slenderman black? He is supposed to be white, with no facial features.
Where are the cameras? Messing with them are a major part of his powers.
Where are the notes? The myth is that the more you know about him, the more aggressive he becomes.
What's with the inky blood and self-harm? He's not an alien parasite.
So many questions...

Not making any judgments yet, but I personally think Slenderman would fit a lot better into a psychological thriller, detective fiction, like Call of Cthulu. Like a detective or parent trying to hunt down a murderer, then realizing it is the work of a monster and that they are in over their heads."
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this is more a character study and less a monster movie
ySy8mcceTno,Yet another game movie they'll ruin
ySy8mcceTno,"Something about the idea of Slender Man creeps me out. Maybe because I live less than 15 miles from where the 2 girls murdered their friend because of Slender Man, gives the story a little more weight."
ySy8mcceTno,It is not like spider man.
ySy8mcceTno,This isn’t scary it’s just weird
ySy8mcceTno,I think it's movie about that two girls who worshipped slender man and stabbed a girl for 20 times!!! like that it's real story check out
ySy8mcceTno,*sigh*
ySy8mcceTno,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa scaryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,THANKS FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m my opinion Slenderman should have been left to the internet. This movie seems to be using cheap “scary” visuals that don’t seem to serve an actual purpose. Marble Hornets would have probably gotten it better.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hopefully they'll make a movie about the SCP Foundation next, maybe connect it to this movie cause it is theorized that SlenderMan is an escaped SCP"
ySy8mcceTno,The second clip in the beginning reminded me of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,this is terribly disrespectful to the stabbing victim and her family. what a nightmare it must be for them.
ySy8mcceTno,It doesnt really look like a slender man movie😐
ySy8mcceTno,AHS season 84
ySy8mcceTno,Edgy
ySy8mcceTno,Wack
ySy8mcceTno,"Ay, is that Logan Paul’s suicide Forrest scene?"
ySy8mcceTno,Where tf is his suit? Disrespectful af
ySy8mcceTno,3spooky5me
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this is good
ySy8mcceTno,A los seguidores de dross nos encanta esto....
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks stupid.It basically has no plot, just pictures"
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly I can see this pissing off all the marbel hornets fans already, like me"
ySy8mcceTno,"Half Life The Movie, MAKE IT HAPPEN!"
ySy8mcceTno,Couple years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Nostalgia
ySy8mcceTno,Where the suit at dooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul *heavy breathing intensifies*
ySy8mcceTno,🅱lender man
ySy8mcceTno,He must have seen a dead body in the suicide forest.
ySy8mcceTno,And to think the person who created this creepypasta won’t get any money from this. Smh
ySy8mcceTno,Who else thought it should've been about the two girls who stabbed their friend because of this game?
ySy8mcceTno,"This should have been done a long time ago, back when Slender Man was a popular, especially around when YouTubers were playing games about him, when there was “sightings” of him, or when he was on the news. Kinda late to do this now."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell yes
ySy8mcceTno,#slendermangagnamstyle
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,The Heroes and Gods saga did a better job of portraying Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,"What is this, an indie film?"
ySy8mcceTno,This is a stranger things movie based in the 21st century with new characters. Hollywood is so original
ySy8mcceTno,"Now you see people? Slender man is wayyy more scarier than fat man. Next time if you see a fat middle age man stand near  kids, just let them be, he might just offer them some candy."
ySy8mcceTno,"This better not be some PG-13 garbage.
#MakeHorrorMoviesRatedRAgain"
ySy8mcceTno,I couldn't see him because you guys didn't put him in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone come to find the gay elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,I never thought they'll make a movie off him
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouMemeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,I bet the movie will end with her getting the 9 pages then dying
ySy8mcceTno,Why slender black though?
ySy8mcceTno,They are actually doing it
ySy8mcceTno,Fun
ySy8mcceTno,Not a great idea
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, huh? Five Nights at Freddy's the mov-- wait what? What do you mean that was supposed to happen?"
ySy8mcceTno,yassss
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG IM SOOO HAPPY
ySy8mcceTno,Out of all the creepy pastas slender man I think Jeff the killer would’ve had a better plot
ySy8mcceTno,Esto no es fake?
ySy8mcceTno,THE PROFECY IS TRUE
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is doing it... This movie is going to suck...
ySy8mcceTno,Finally don't screw this up Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,This actually doesnt look half bad
ySy8mcceTno,"sony pictures, you do realise you're late, very late?"
ySy8mcceTno,This gonna be bad
ySy8mcceTno,this was relevant about 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,I don't get it.
ySy8mcceTno,"https://youtu.be/jud4yUGnm84


Is so good"
ySy8mcceTno,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Is about time
ySy8mcceTno,"THEY SHOULD'VE MADE THIS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,  WHEN I WAS IN MY CREEPYPASTA PHASE. 
Of course they make it after I get over creepypastas 😥"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is probably going to suck...
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, they want their shitty creepypasta back"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,Que mierda es esta!
ySy8mcceTno,From the creators of the Emoji Movie....
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like a crappy movie, good job sony as always."
ySy8mcceTno,Oof
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of that horror video that Gabe showed everyone in that one episode of The Office
ySy8mcceTno,If this was made like 4 years ago id be shaking in my pants right now lol... not anymore

ySy8mcceTno,No le entendí ni madres
ySy8mcceTno,DO NOT MESS THIS MOVIE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This is... kinda bad?

I dunno, I'm happy they're making an old favourite creepypasta into a high production movie, but this doesn't feel.... Slenderman? Everything is so random..."
ySy8mcceTno,that's one spooky boi
ySy8mcceTno,Para que verga voy a verla si ya vi el inicio y el final alv
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta fans screeching in the background. Next thing you know a Jeff The Killer Movie is gonna be released
ySy8mcceTno,Pensé que iba a estar mejor ):
ySy8mcceTno,10 years late but alright...
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like they dusted of an oldie with this one.
ySy8mcceTno,"Dark, twisted, hopefully R-Rated, I have high hopes for this."
ySy8mcceTno,Way to strike the iron while it's hot Sony
ySy8mcceTno,YES!! I've been waiting so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t be a stupid kid.
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe if this was a couple of years a go it would fit but slender man is too old
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell yeah! This should be AWESOME SOME CALL MARKIMOO
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,Spoiler alert 🚨.Slender Man is LOGAN PAUL!!!
ySy8mcceTno,12 year old me is quaking
ySy8mcceTno,If wasn't produced by sony I would actually be genuinely excited.
ySy8mcceTno,We tried to contain it with memes but it seems to have reached movies
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh great, another video game movie... Hopefully this one is delayed like FnaF's"
ySy8mcceTno,Bet you this ones gonna suck too
ySy8mcceTno,I can't sleep>_<
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been so good in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,Please dont be a netflix movie.  Deathnote sucked
ySy8mcceTno,"The poor little girl that had to go through a stabbing in honor of ""Slenderman"" is going to be haunted by this Everytime it airs a commercial! 💔"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,This'll be fun to see!
ySy8mcceTno,Como pudiste acabar asi >:'v
ySy8mcceTno,If the writers/director knew what they were doing Slenderman would be hidden in the back of every shot of that trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Now they need to make a jeff the killer movie now lol
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it will be more interesting if it wasn't really slender man but like a mental illness in the movie. She said in the trailer he gets in your head so it could mean that the fear of his presence from the original creepy pasta story lead people to crazy schizophrenic episodes, kind of like the real story where the two girls tried to kill their friend because they believed slender man told them to or he would kill their family. That's just what i think though"
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is going to bomb. lol I'll still watch it, just not in theaters."
ySy8mcceTno,And now i wait for a Skinwalker Movie. That'll be a real hoot.
ySy8mcceTno,This is fake
ySy8mcceTno,"A feminist will be mad it said ""man"" in the title I am calling it."
ySy8mcceTno,Slim fucker
ySy8mcceTno,It seemed like this barely had anything to do with slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,"Why, have they not heard from the sabbing"
ySy8mcceTno,this is Quite late Wasn't Slendy Popular back in 2009
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice, 5 years later :v"
ySy8mcceTno,So basically marble hornets the movie. Awesome!! Anyone else watch the original slender man videos from marble hornets before the game came out?
ySy8mcceTno,Sumbudy tucha ma spuget
ySy8mcceTno,this is probably gonna be completely off from the source material but yeah
ySy8mcceTno,Yupp just like Spider-Man but he's black
ySy8mcceTno,Boring.
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah you're about 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,This seems wrong.... but i high key wanna watch it
ySy8mcceTno,All my years of creepypasta fanfic have led me to this moment
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally... There were roumos about this from the 2016 until now, it seens pretty nice"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh yes finally a creepy pasta films, wonder about more films like that"
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Filmed in my hometown boiiii
ySy8mcceTno,Sees woods asks where is Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,This is one good comedy.
ySy8mcceTno,S l e n d e r m a n t h e m o i v e
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, honestly this could be a good movie, but I swear to god if its rated pg-13 there's no use in watching it."
ySy8mcceTno,That's tuff you feel me!?
ySy8mcceTno,I’m spooked
ySy8mcceTno,Any gamers here?
ySy8mcceTno,dumb gurl move outta that town
ySy8mcceTno,Is this movie really necessary
ySy8mcceTno,I'm guessing Christian Bale will not be playing slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 6 or 7 years too late. Where's the Five Night's At Freddy's movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Now all I want is a FNaF movie
ySy8mcceTno,1:10 no one else see that doll thing in the branches? 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy am I ready to watch them ruin one of the best character from creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,We. Have. Waited. For. This. So. Long. FINALLY! Now I dont have to watch fan made ones.
ySy8mcceTno,Literally next to Logan Paul on trending...
ySy8mcceTno,Fake... right?... someone please tell me I'm right?
ySy8mcceTno,Fidget spinner movie coming 2030
ySy8mcceTno,Who the hell holds a marker like that..that’s the scary part
ySy8mcceTno,Now make a slendertubbies movie.. i would pay my left nut to see that
ySy8mcceTno,21k retarded mothafuckas thought this was dope
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I beeen waiting on this
ySy8mcceTno,This is stupid.  What a waste of money.
ySy8mcceTno,Si fuera él 2015 fuera un éxito :v
ySy8mcceTno,slenderina and her grandma is 10x scarier then slenderman if made into a movie. 😱
ySy8mcceTno,i played this game and I threw my phone across the room right when Slenderman popped up lol
ySy8mcceTno,1:06 h
ySy8mcceTno,Should’ve made this when Slenderman was still relevant
ySy8mcceTno,12 year old me would've used this movie as fuel for her Slender Man x reader fanfic. I'm so glad I grew out of that phase.
ySy8mcceTno,Next is the Harlem Shake movie
ySy8mcceTno,um?? ok
ySy8mcceTno,Yes about time this happens
ySy8mcceTno,Nope! Don't make Slenderman have cliche monster sounds! Don't even make him make any sounds! It's more suspenseful and terrifying if people don't know whether it's near them or not.
ySy8mcceTno,iM QUAKING AAAA IM SO EXCITED I HOPE IT COMES OUT IN A FEW MONTHS!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for netflix?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman > Bye Bye Man
ySy8mcceTno,So Like i have long arms and my friends call me slender man ? is this about me im confused?
ySy8mcceTno,Is that the same forest Logan what lol
ySy8mcceTno,This’ll be the hottest movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"""XxXSlenderManxWatchYoBackXx"""
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/j1aGraevkVc
ySy8mcceTno,Is there something I'm missing? This seems like it has nothing to do with Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,What more now creepy pastas because Movies. Bring in Slenderina too
ySy8mcceTno,She dies
ySy8mcceTno,What is in the girl's hand...... A ripped up ticket to this movie
ySy8mcceTno,I did not understand this at all
ySy8mcceTno,"Thanks Sony. No, really..."
ySy8mcceTno,just go watch Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Please no this started as a story
ySy8mcceTno,"Or you could stick to the original creepy pasta and game, that’d be great"
ySy8mcceTno,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING SOOO LOOONG FOR A SLENDER MAN MOVIE!!!!        
 
AND HERE IT IS!!!!😆😆😆😆"
ySy8mcceTno,you know there's a problem when the movie looks fanmade 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Next horror is gonna be fucking run n hide from sir pepe
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony has no idea what Slender Man actually is, do they?"
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,The beginning to Sony’s new movie franchise
ySy8mcceTno,This is the most generic movie trailer I've ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,hot garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Hey that’s pretty good I can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the movie is better than the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"No Sony, please don't ruin my favorite horror game series :("
ySy8mcceTno,If you watch this you're a fagit.
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would win: the most intelligent race in the planet, capable of space travel and computers, who invented the internet,
Or one staticky boi"
ySy8mcceTno,"Give me 20 dollars, give me 20 dollars..."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie doesn’t really seem interesting.
ySy8mcceTno,"1:23 for the Gay Elephant Noise, if you're looking for it."
ySy8mcceTno,"Ooh, neat-o. Looks like I've time traveled to 2011."
ySy8mcceTno,2 and a half minutes of my life wasted...
ySy8mcceTno,*O o f*
ySy8mcceTno,This needs to stop...now
ySy8mcceTno,Después seguirá Dear David  la película
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is coming out like 5 years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Really? Making this after that girl got stabbed y her friends 16 times?
ySy8mcceTno,It's like something out of the guys who made The Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony better not mess up Slenderman. He's been an icon on the internet for a long time. I actually like creepypasta (if you accept Slender Man in that universe) They are six years late lol
ySy8mcceTno,A 2018 film about a game that was popular in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp, here we go."
ySy8mcceTno,Sign me up
ySy8mcceTno,I hope I’m wrong but I don’t think this is going to be a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,How much you wanna bet the author of the creepypasta is gonna get nothing
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see it so bad now
ySy8mcceTno,Dayum creepy af
ySy8mcceTno,"Llegaste tarde , 15 años tarde. Jpg"
ySy8mcceTno,Is is this real
ySy8mcceTno,Who else has a friend who is obsessed with this and Five Nights at Freddy's?
ySy8mcceTno,"i jUST GOT OVER MY FEAR OF THE GAMEPLAYS, AND THIS IS WHAT I GET?"
ySy8mcceTno,BHD should react to this
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s the suit smh
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman 2 is just Keemstar, running around in the woods with his 1$"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender isn’t a thing anymore
ySy8mcceTno,So slender is like the bye bye man but with tentacles basically?
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this is a strange things rip off but it's not
ySy8mcceTno,Wait I SAW THAT GUY IN ONE OF LOGAN PAULS VIDEOS
ySy8mcceTno,I didnt even know this was coming. Now all i want is a Jeff the Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Eh it don’t look too good
ySy8mcceTno,IM WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR SURE
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting on that Jeff the killer movie......
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the thumbnail said Spider-Man...
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Sony Fucked up another Awesome character.  @Blumhouse please show them how its done.
ySy8mcceTno,Yall a few years late
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t they know the first rule of slender man. Never look back and never stare at it
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t remember slender man being like that
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,This is the shittiest movie trailer i have ever seen.
ySy8mcceTno,"*SPOILER*

*At the end of this movie Georgie dies at the beginning.*"
ySy8mcceTno,Como cuando intentas revivir algo muerto dead wakin dead :v
ySy8mcceTno,So what the hell does any of this have to do with peices of paper
ySy8mcceTno,The movie that no one wanted
ySy8mcceTno,Right when I saw the thumbnail I was like “They actually did it”
ySy8mcceTno,Special Thanks to Logan Paul for inspiration.
ySy8mcceTno,"I saw this before on another channel and I thought it was fan made. But Nope this is a real,  official trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,I like how a dating sim is scarier than this
ySy8mcceTno,Logan pual suicide forest body explained
ySy8mcceTno,I bet there's a easter egg of Logan Paul vlogin in the corner
ySy8mcceTno,You are going to ruin my favorite creepy pasta! This is so inaccurate!
ySy8mcceTno,"1:23 Marik & Bakura were right, I can heard Jonathan in the movie XD."
ySy8mcceTno,Look a CreppyPasta Cinematic Universe
ySy8mcceTno,Wow now onto slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Ive been waiting for this one for 3 years
ySy8mcceTno,Of course it is Sony’s
ySy8mcceTno,Little late to the Slender craze aren’t you Sony? I mean when was Slender popular? 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,5 years late bruh
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is this garbage trending!?.. it's like i could tie my shoes while walking down the street, someone videos it and posts it on YouTube and boom!! 20 min views!.. lol the world we live in."
ySy8mcceTno,another thriller movie that starts at a cemetery

ySy8mcceTno,TENGO QUE IR A VERLA
ySy8mcceTno,Doo this movie look lit
ySy8mcceTno,Sucks.
ySy8mcceTno,This is kind of change some things  and sony kind of slow slenderman was popular in 2012 and 13 but this year i dont  think so but it still looks awesome
ySy8mcceTno,Channel zero and now this? Yeees
ySy8mcceTno,It took me a second to remember who this guy is....
ySy8mcceTno,I saw thus on  trending and tought it was a joke

ySy8mcceTno,"An investigator is preforming video interviews with survivors of this Phenomenon. She narrates this movie.

The tapes display the date of the recording, the persons name, and the time of their disappearance after the interview.

As more and more people tell her about the slender man phenomenon, she begins to notice...things. Her mentality is slowly, subtly uprooted. But she continues.

She discovers the nature of this phenomenon,  coming face to unface with it, and after following enough clues, arrives at a near lethal conclusion. But she survives.

Pan out, she is the one being interviewed by a new investigator. She has been telling this new investigator, telling you, what led to her incarceration at the mental facility she is now housed in.

As she finishes The interview, including a plea to take her story seriously, the familiar text that is included in every other interview is displayed. The date of the recording, the name of the former investigator, and the time of her disappearance.

That's a slender man movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a snore fest
ySy8mcceTno,Geez this trailer put me to sleep cause of how boring it is
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late Sony..
ySy8mcceTno,"They shot this movie in my town and high school! The classroom is our chemistry class, I go there every day. 👌"
ySy8mcceTno,This already seems like this won't be good
ySy8mcceTno,"Little Kuriboh predicted this movie in 2010, don’t believe me? Look up “Concrete Giraffes” for proof. Also, Sony, I heard Mine Sweeper and Solitaire are your next big projects; so great, can’t wait :-3"
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this about 8 years late?
ySy8mcceTno,i was a big creepypasta fan in like 2014 and now they're trying to make a stupid movie ok great
ySy8mcceTno,Holy 💩
ySy8mcceTno,I want to die. The world isn't worth it anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I feel like this is gonna be complete horseshit
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,if this movie ends up being great it could mean a series of creepy pastas
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy
ySy8mcceTno,where are you jackfilms ?
ySy8mcceTno,"I’d rather see a movie about the girl who stabbed her friend as a tribute to him, honestly."
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing to save this movie is if it has a hard R rating
ySy8mcceTno,"The abstract imagery made me feel like this is going to be a cheap ripoff of The Ring. Also, when that girl says ""he gets in your head"" that made me think of Samara too. Hopefully, the actual film will tie everything together in a new & interesting way.
Otherwise, it looked great. I'll definitely check it out!"
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all are a little late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look right. Where is his suit? His tentacles are missing also
ySy8mcceTno,This Movie Looks Like It About To Flop When It Hits Theaters
ySy8mcceTno,But why I mean why.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm honestly looking forward to this
ySy8mcceTno,😐 I have no words other than if I seen this I would never ever come out of my bed again 😐
ySy8mcceTno,I remember the games
ySy8mcceTno,"Well they certainly did a good job of making their movie look like absolute trash. A bunch of pointless shock imagery and some ""creepy"" sound effects that have no context. Yeah, that's what Slenderman is. Mhmm. The movie might be better than this, but the trailer just seems like a bunch of crap that will only be insulting to people that care about the whole mythos."
ySy8mcceTno,what?
ySy8mcceTno,Only came here bc i thought it said Spider-Man
ySy8mcceTno,$1000 this movie didn't come out.
ySy8mcceTno,Early 2000's making a comeback. And I love it.
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul did it fist he beat slender man to it
ySy8mcceTno,this probably won't even come close to conparing to Marble Hornets tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Id rather just watch marble hornets .
ySy8mcceTno,"I swear, 90% of these comments seem to be ""It's too late"". Let's be honest here, if it came out back then, we would have all said it was Hollywood clickbait. And besides, I for one think it's cool when Hollywood tries to bring something back in a unique way. I mean, don't get me wrong, it still seems pretty generic, but for a character who's always written as such a foreboding guy, we never really hear anything about what he actually does, do we? I, for one, am pretty excited, good or bad."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like garbage .
ySy8mcceTno,What is it with these forrest videos?
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh hell no im saving for avengers infinity war, black panther, incredibles 2."
ySy8mcceTno,WHAAAAAT
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this movie will be terrible and it will ruin the scare factor of the original creepypasta by having those who have never heard of it before taint known knowledge and twist it to fit the plot of the movie. It would be better off as a television series imo.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is so 2013-2014... What's next a five nights at Freddy's movie...

OH MY GOD IM A WIZARD!"
ySy8mcceTno,*Yes. I’ve been waiting for a slender man movie!!!*
ySy8mcceTno,"Resident evil 7 : the slender man 

Hahahahahahaha"
ySy8mcceTno,Why can't it be like a man hunt beast movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Next is TIC TAC TOE THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Best part was at 2:39
ySy8mcceTno,Pure trash.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a shitty movie
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is my second best creepy pasta
ySy8mcceTno,Why why why why why why is all i ask
ySy8mcceTno,Like why tho
ySy8mcceTno,Why is desaturation so creepy?!
ySy8mcceTno,Is this legit? Lmao!
ySy8mcceTno,Huh.. Well it doesn't look shitty..
ySy8mcceTno,Sony's really gonna get a reputation for making movies no one would watch unironically
ySy8mcceTno,it took years but im digging it
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a fan-made trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Ik this is already going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,Another Forest Video....
ySy8mcceTno,really?
ySy8mcceTno,its slendar
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Think there will be a lot of problems with this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Slendy
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh God, this is going to be a train wreck."
ySy8mcceTno,If only Logan Paul and Slenderman were in the same forest
ySy8mcceTno,At 2:19 I can only imagine her going 👌👌 gotcha
ySy8mcceTno,oh look Sony trying hard to be relevant and cool... just like with the emoji movie and look how well that went
ySy8mcceTno,Leave it up to AAA publishers to jump on a hype train long after the hype is over.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow a company who completely screwed up with there last film
(The emoji movie) 
Made slender who is a dude who is wearing a white bodysuit and has a tux on
Into a movie
Where is he? He isn’t even seen"
ySy8mcceTno,The slenderman trailer is the Best Birthday gift I got today
ySy8mcceTno,what this shet men?
ySy8mcceTno,Only a decade too late
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf ? Look like the ring... I don't like it
ySy8mcceTno,I like Slenderman but this trailer sucks. Hopefully the movies good
ySy8mcceTno,Ive seen him.... hes real
ySy8mcceTno,should have released this in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,"I would like these films to be developed
Deep web
Daysis destruction
Charlie Charlie
Homunculus
Dear David
Jeff the Killer
Urban Exploration"
ySy8mcceTno,Woah is this real??? The waiting is finally over??
ySy8mcceTno,Who is here because of Little kuriboh
ySy8mcceTno,This looks alright
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh dang, its only been a couple days and they already announced Logan Paul Explores The Suicide Forest The Movie"
ySy8mcceTno,we did it reddit
ySy8mcceTno,this has the opportunity to be a cool sci fi thriller but a really shitty horror
ySy8mcceTno,Can wait to see if this goes down in flames.
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks boring, might watch when it comes out on tv"
ySy8mcceTno,YES!
ySy8mcceTno,So Stranger Things The Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Made by sony? Cant wait for Spider-Man to stop him.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is not the kind of route I thought they would go. I really thought they would stick to the history of slender man and of course the taking of children, but this is more of a phycological plot."
ySy8mcceTno,Welp I'm having nightmares tonight
ySy8mcceTno,You think logan paul will record their deaths in this forrest?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally someone made it into a movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Oops! I forgot to be scared.
ySy8mcceTno,wat
ySy8mcceTno,uh.. why?
ySy8mcceTno,I’m down to see this movie but it looks messed up
ySy8mcceTno,I want to c it._.
ySy8mcceTno,I guess a good excuse for slendy boi not appearing often is because you cant directly film him or it gets corrupted. That would be a bit lazy though.
ySy8mcceTno,Ayyyy Tentacle Porn irl an it's a movie can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Give me $20
ySy8mcceTno,"If this movie is decent, it will break box office records. My friends and I are already looking for a date to save."
ySy8mcceTno,Too late to the party buddies. I hope you stay true to the lore! I’d hate to see this flop entirely.
ySy8mcceTno,When you think about it this technically is a video game movie....and is doomed to fail
ySy8mcceTno,10 yrs too late sony
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait? 
Slender is in the woods
Logan found a dead body (and laughed at it) 
Slender Man is LOGAN"
ySy8mcceTno,The tall man movie is way better
ySy8mcceTno,Stupid. The horror genre has gone to pure predictable shock value and originality has all but disappeared.
ySy8mcceTno,The original game was more scary than this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Yay let's make a movie about an internet urban legend. This movie is geared to teens that don't know anything about horror movies.
ySy8mcceTno,"It doesn't look awful, but I don't know what else to say. According to IMDB, Victor Surge, who was apparently the original creator of the Slender Man and worked on Marble Hornets, is one of the writers on this film. So that gives me a little bit of hope."
ySy8mcceTno,"I think this is gonna be one of the worst movies of 2018 🙃









Sorry not sorry"
ySy8mcceTno,"I misread it and thought it said Spiderman.
 I was like WTF is goin on?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Not only is this movie being made about 5 years too late, it also kind of ruins the character of ""slenderman"" to give him a story. The thing that makes slenderman scary is the mystery surrounding him, not knowing what he's capable of and not knowing his back story. Only time will tell, but so far this movie seems like a big  cash grab."
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? Hefty Man?
ySy8mcceTno,I had my volume up all the way when I clicked on the video and scared an actual fart out of me.
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would win 
4 girls 

Or 


One slendy boi"
ySy8mcceTno,"No nO
NOOOOOOO

WHO LET THE EMOJI MOVIE PRODUCERS GET THEIR HANDS ON THIS goaLlY"
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks a lot better hen I thought it would
ySy8mcceTno,I hear no gay elephant!
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting on that God Particle (Cloverfield 3) trailer!
ySy8mcceTno,2019 Fat Woman
ySy8mcceTno,Are you still living in 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would win 4 highschool girls or 

One faceless boi"
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks kinda good
ySy8mcceTno,Puta me cagué :v
ySy8mcceTno,Ayyy that’s what’s up
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next?, a Suicide Mouse movie by Fox?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderina for 2019!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this trailer...told us nothing about the plot. I'm assuming a girl get's haunted by him? Even though in Marble Hornet's it was a guy? And what's with the random deaths throughout? Are they possessed? Nothing about this is what Slenderman was about. I'm gonna give the film the benefit of the doubt and simply put the blame on whoever organized this trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,My childhood is a movie
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, I just love it when people add a space between ""slender"" and ""man""! It's my favorite thing in the whole wide world to know his name is being spelled wrong!"
ySy8mcceTno,1:20 Am I watching Slenderman or Scarecrow from Batman?
ySy8mcceTno,Quien diría que un invento de nosotros ( web y youtube ) c convirtiria en esto :/
ySy8mcceTno,2021: Trollface the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t expect much. We all know how this is most likely going to go down
ySy8mcceTno,NOOOOOOOOOO my scariest nightmare..
ySy8mcceTno,What is she holding at the end.
ySy8mcceTno,storyline?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so predictable
ySy8mcceTno,there's no way in hell my parents are going to let me watch that movie
ySy8mcceTno,Idk about this movie. I'll wait till the reviews come out
ySy8mcceTno,this is why warner brothers is better than $ony
ySy8mcceTno,no entendí ni madres
ySy8mcceTno,Ring 4 looks good
ySy8mcceTno,This was made soooo late
ySy8mcceTno,I'm so ready for this please don't let them ruin slendy.
ySy8mcceTno,*HARDDD PASS*
ySy8mcceTno,"if trailer is so boring , wonder film going to be a tourtred to watch.."
ySy8mcceTno,"This is gonna be crap it steals stuff from the ring 

The concept of seeing the video or slender man

Going insane or bloodlust


Having the monster try to kill you 

Simple"
ySy8mcceTno,Is 2018 trying to tell us something about forests. Or YouTube.
ySy8mcceTno,I did not see this coming. ...(do u get the joke?!) ☺
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was fan made until I saw it was made by Sony. Lmao I'm so done
ySy8mcceTno,Dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,This makes up for the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Im waiting for the live action Minecraft movie.
ySy8mcceTno,if done right this can actually be pretty good.
ySy8mcceTno,i just know this will be rated R
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy pastas have gone to far
ySy8mcceTno,HECK YEAH!
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,This is ridiculous; Hollywood wants to rip everything off. Its astounding that they just won't refuse to come up with original ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,"""People don't just disappear""








*Thinks of Stranger Things*"
ySy8mcceTno,"how much you bet in 2026
its going to be  Fnaf the movie: and in the trailers its just a guy hearing things move than we have a small glimps of him checking his camera than he run to shut the door after it proceeds to show cops than thats the end of thr trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,BRUTAL
ySy8mcceTno,Esto me da una impresión de que será puro relleno y no tendrá casi nada que ver con la Creepypasta original
ySy8mcceTno,where's the Jeff the killer movie at?
ySy8mcceTno,Oh woah sony your only like 6 years late to the trend can't wait for dat Boi:2021
ySy8mcceTno,1:06 *H*
ySy8mcceTno,"If I'm not scared does that mean I have some weird tioe of mental issue, to me all the did was throw in some ""scary"" visuals. I bet slender would be scarier than this. I love creepypastas and slender but this is just..... ahhhh"
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah Sony, you’re about 5 years late for this one."
ySy8mcceTno,I’m disappointed that they siding incorporate the notes
ySy8mcceTno,They probably just stole this story and aren't giving any money to the OG creator because it's uncopyrighted
ySy8mcceTno,Looks whack :/
ySy8mcceTno,"..It was just.. very vague to me, idk."
ySy8mcceTno,2056: Amnesia: The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be  fire
ySy8mcceTno,Brittyy44 anyone?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman*
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn't the whole slender man craze a few years ago
ySy8mcceTno,No me convenció
ySy8mcceTno,How did one reddit post go this far
ySy8mcceTno,"People saying ""Few years too late"" make me laugh. Y'all don't understand how Hollywood works. You don't just make a movie in a year. This was probably in the works back when you're saying it should've come out. Also, let's see: was Finding Dory too late? Was Jumanji 2 too late? What about Toy Story 3? Doesn't matter how ""late"" something comes out. People will always go and see it."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man? I call it red light green light :)
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY THE SLENDER MAN HAS BEEN UNLEASHED
ySy8mcceTno,Putting Slenderman next to a guy talking about his video which had a dead guy in the woods... Huh that's totally not fooked
ySy8mcceTno,😍😍😍😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,Looked like a perfume commercial
ySy8mcceTno,this will be trash LMAO
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like this is gonna be like Godzilla where you only actually see slenderman like 7 minutes in total throughout the whole movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Ehh, I was excited at first then when I watched it and felt a little upset. This doesn't really strike me as ""Slenderman"" but that's just me. I'll wait to see what the upcoming trailers are and stuff."
ySy8mcceTno,sucks
ySy8mcceTno,Looking forward to seeing this.
ySy8mcceTno,Wack
ySy8mcceTno,What a wacky dude
ySy8mcceTno,A horror movie from 2018 based off of a game from 2012 that’s based off of a creepy website from the mid 2000s... wtf
ySy8mcceTno,"Fear the Man, The Slender Man. For he can do, what no one can."
ySy8mcceTno,Tell me why I'm ACTUALLY SO HYPR for this. I hope its good. Please let it be well done
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would’ve made more sense HAD it come out 4–5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,"who would win? 
One paper collecting nerd or one staticy boi"
ySy8mcceTno,"Emoji movie wasn’t enough, was it"
ySy8mcceTno,This would be a perfect found footage film...oh wait
ySy8mcceTno,dead people in a forest? too soon dude.....
ySy8mcceTno,You're like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Wow that sucked if it was made like 10 years ago it would get some hype
ySy8mcceTno,I clicked on this because I thought it said spider man
ySy8mcceTno,2018 getting off at a good note
ySy8mcceTno,Any movie with sony sort of sucks lol
ySy8mcceTno,...they should've made this movie a long time ago
ySy8mcceTno,Bringing this back hm?
ySy8mcceTno,Will it have idubbbz dancing to PSY in it?
ySy8mcceTno,"But like, why?"
ySy8mcceTno,I guess this guy still wants his twenty dollars
ySy8mcceTno,This is late
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman gangnam style
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Im sorry, but this looks really stupid."
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 oof
ySy8mcceTno,Do wtf.
ySy8mcceTno,Omg 😱
ySy8mcceTno,"Hopefully no little kid stabs their friend this year because of ""Slender Man""😳"
ySy8mcceTno,Why are 95% of all horror films complete garbage?   This looks like part of that 95%
ySy8mcceTno,Enough with these crappy horror movies can we just get grown ups 3 already? Gosh!
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm setting my expectations very low, however, I think they might pull it off"
ySy8mcceTno,"As late as this movie feels, I think it will be better than Sony’s abomination, The Emoji Movie. This doesn’t feel like a cheap ad and the visuals are pretty impressive. I have high hopes that this will be better than other Sony films."
ySy8mcceTno,this isnt 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Really stupid Sony. You know two girls almost killed another over that game and now your going to make movie. Anything for money I guess.
ySy8mcceTno,2012 called they want thier movie back
ySy8mcceTno,This looks hella boring. Screaming ? Amateurs
ySy8mcceTno,"Movies that are created solely to latch onto a trend are always crap. But this movie is 5 years too late, sooooo... double crap?"
ySy8mcceTno,For the people saying they're late in making this movie: have you any idea how long it takes to make a movie yet a lone write a script for the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Noup
ySy8mcceTno,FIRST EMOJIS NOW SLENDERMAN.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is probably gonna be terrible
ySy8mcceTno,I’m guessing next will be a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,They are sooooo late for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Fnaf? Oh wait.....it's in the works.
ySy8mcceTno,Essa imagem apática do Slender que dá medo.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good in my opinion
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Have a Logan Paul cameo of him finding a slendy victim in the woods and vlogging about it. At least with that this movie would be somewhat relevant.
ySy8mcceTno,"If he isn't dressed well, it's inaccurate, but then again, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,i think ppl need to stfu about it being relevant or not to make a movie about slender men ...when we waited even longer for the incredibles 2 ...not to compare apples to oranges
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, another cashgrab from $ony."
ySy8mcceTno,2018: The Fidget Spinner Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Im watching this at night. Halp
ySy8mcceTno,Dolan Darker I need memes of this trailer right now
ySy8mcceTno,Well this looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Of course it's sony. They brought back the most irrelevant ""horror game"" and made a movie? Fnaf movie is next ffs"
ySy8mcceTno,This is coming out waaaay too late... And it doesn't look like Slender Man. Thanks Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Espere muchos años por esto ;-;
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Sony run out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,I would like to see what slenderman looks like *plzzzz*
ySy8mcceTno,this movie aint complete unless he does gangam style
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,omg yaaaaaaas I've always knew that this would come
ySy8mcceTno,I was wondering when a movie about this was gonna come out.
ySy8mcceTno,Ok but there missed so many opportunities to put him in the background of shots that you'd have to pause and really look to see him. I know because I tried so many times.
ySy8mcceTno,"""#2 on Trending"".

2, you mean the 2 eyes he doesn't have.

St0p m0ckiNg hIm he is SPECIAL"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wow another video game movie...😒
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 Gay elephant Noise Jonathan
ySy8mcceTno,"Llego tarde la pelicula pero no pierdo mis esperanzas, esperare verla primero antes de jusgar mal,  despues de todo es slenderman y tengo fe en que sera algo parecido a lo que ya vimos en el conjuro 1 y 2, y no quiero que todo sea pvto screamer, solo pido eso."
ySy8mcceTno,If I didn’t see the title I wouldn’t have even come close to thinking this was a movie about Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,Is this actually a thing?!😄😄😄
ySy8mcceTno,Ya la quiero veeeeeer
ySy8mcceTno,"I read the title so wrong ,,, I thought it was Spider-Man ,,, and as I was watching it because I really wasn’t paying attention the sounds confused me ,,, so I started watching and then I said “wow marvel is really stepping up” and the it ended and I realized ,,, this is slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,BOOGA BOOGA FINGERS
ySy8mcceTno,Why SONY????????
ySy8mcceTno,I beat my meat to this lol jk
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this a horror/thriller not a comedy
ySy8mcceTno,I feel 12 years old again.
ySy8mcceTno,Look like one of those cheap horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,Best comedy movie of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,"This movie is so early will we get to see ""the fidget spinner movie"" in 2028?"
ySy8mcceTno,"To quote LittleKuriboh from 6 YEARS AGO! ""Geez a Slender Man movie? I guess Hollywood really IS out of ideas."""
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna flop major hard lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Candy crush the movie is coming out next. Its about a real tough guy requesting more lives from all his friends on facebook over and over again all day long.
ySy8mcceTno,What really?
ySy8mcceTno,It is a bit late but honestly it looks pretty good
ySy8mcceTno,Never gonna watch dis maybe
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not into horror stuff but why do people feel the need to hate on something without giving it a chance...
ySy8mcceTno,That's it? He didn't even have his suit #notmyslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,WTF YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSKSKSKSKSSSSSS
ySy8mcceTno,think i saw Logan vlogging in the background
ySy8mcceTno,Better nor be replaced with the emoji movie 2.
ySy8mcceTno,"When I first heard of Slendy all those years ago, I fell in love with him. I'm so happy its getting a movie, I don't care for the hate, I want this movie so much"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you need to stop
ySy8mcceTno,I am confusion
ySy8mcceTno,Are they staring Kylo Ren as Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/rC5S-A163m4
ySy8mcceTno,I got a feeling this movie will suck
ySy8mcceTno,Make a movie about 4chan
ySy8mcceTno,The forest will probably have 20 minutes of screen time.
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? A Jeff the killer movie? :U
ySy8mcceTno,I only want to watch this because a deep part of me still likes creepypastas lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"I want to support this, but we all know it's going to be trashy"
ySy8mcceTno,Yeahh you’re about 7 Years late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,Got to be the worst trailer ever... might have seen the movie if it came out like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Some people are excited for this movie, some think it’s going to be awful, but my question is....




What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?"
ySy8mcceTno,OH GOD PLEASE DONT
ySy8mcceTno,Like 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/NG6-otOX_94
ySy8mcceTno,10 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,This should be trending number 1. Not that dumb Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDYYYYYYYY <3
ySy8mcceTno,0:21 don't worry Logan Paul will find her in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,Theres Probably gonna be an Augmented Reality slender game in the coming future
ySy8mcceTno,Ahhhhhh sony ruining another great thing
ySy8mcceTno,Well this movies five years too late
ySy8mcceTno,iDubbbz needs to get sponsored by Sony to remaster Slender Man Gangnam Style
ySy8mcceTno,This movie look hella gay to be honest
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 Logan paul
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,There's a comment that has more likes than this preview!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony entertainment, where you can find many great films! Our selection includes movies about talking emojis living in your phone, and movies about demonic creatures possessing the minds of young children! 🤗"
ySy8mcceTno,is this real? please tell me this movie is real.
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly, this doesn't look that bad, I hope they don't screw it up"
ySy8mcceTno,"Willow Rose, has a book titled Slender Man. I wonder is based on it?"
ySy8mcceTno,This should have came out eight years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Fidget spinner the movie
ySy8mcceTno,OMG he at the movie this time
ySy8mcceTno,I'm not even sure what this is about at this point...
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman: WHERE'S MY SUPER SUIT!?
ySy8mcceTno,Roblox version is more scary
ySy8mcceTno,whats the point of making this now
ySy8mcceTno,I'll see....
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOICE making creepypasta movies now I like it
ySy8mcceTno,"I gave u all the clues mister slender
 you could have saved her
⛄️"
ySy8mcceTno,"I like it, kind of a Lovecraft meets Slenderman kinda thing. That just the sight of Slendy makes you go insane is more interesting than red-light green-light with a basic 3D model."
ySy8mcceTno,When is it coming out?
ySy8mcceTno,"Screw this movie already. I love Slenderman but this looks like another basic jumpscare ""horror"" movie"
ySy8mcceTno,looks fake
ySy8mcceTno,this looks kinda dumb... but I'm still gonna go and watch it.
ySy8mcceTno,This is about as cool as ba ba dook
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible...
ySy8mcceTno,Btw people slender man was created by a man who competed in a urban legend contest
ySy8mcceTno,I kinda want to see a Jeff The Killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Bigger meme than the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,another thing ruined
ySy8mcceTno,"Look at that another forest
*how convenient*"
ySy8mcceTno,The gay elephant noise!!
ySy8mcceTno,"What’s next, the SCP movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Luke skywalker dies
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks really bad
ySy8mcceTno,Not what I expected...
ySy8mcceTno,Is this actually really a trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t wait to watch a bootleg version 6 months later
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is my favorite creepypasta character
ySy8mcceTno,Sony gone done it again
ySy8mcceTno,Does this mean we will see Masky Tictoc Toby Smiley???
ySy8mcceTno,OMG there's a movie coming out about slender men I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,the creators of the video game must be so proud
ySy8mcceTno,Who would actually be a good casting for slender man? Like a really tall man that’s very thin?
ySy8mcceTno,Show the papers!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,When I was a kid I was horrified of slender man so if they bring that terror back with this movie then I will probably call my buddies to come relive our past horrors. Good job Sony for scaring me half to death after watching this trailer. Can’t wait to watch this film.
ySy8mcceTno,"This chain of events will keep me far away from the woods first a slenderoo then a even more frightening logan paul sighting ...WHEN WILL IT END ,oh yeah and JT's song the only positive"
ySy8mcceTno,Already know this gonna be the worst movie of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Are you ready for the Creepypasta cinematic universe?
ySy8mcceTno,Here we go
ySy8mcceTno,Oh frick what is wrong with the start up of this year?!
ySy8mcceTno,You can tell it a bad movie
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,tribetwelve is better
ySy8mcceTno,Achei uma merda
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey look, an actual horror movie"
ySy8mcceTno,I bet they'll make a movie about Herobrine from Minecraft next.
ySy8mcceTno,Not as good as Marble Hornets
ySy8mcceTno,"Pleeeease let this movie be good. Despite the current meme status, Slenderman is basically our generation's monster. He is our boogieman, and it's great."
ySy8mcceTno,Gay asf
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m a scary potato 🥔



RAWWWWWWWWW"
ySy8mcceTno,...yep
ySy8mcceTno,not impressed
ySy8mcceTno,"If this is going to be good, this is going to make slender man known online again and soon it will be treated like it was before where there is shitty art by 10 year olds on deviant art and he isn’t scary anymore"
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, six years later"
ySy8mcceTno,It's about fucking time Hollywood... But if this sucks I'm still gonna be pissed. (so far expectations are low)
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this movie getting hate? This is just the trailer and who knows it might actually be good. Give it a chance.
ySy8mcceTno,Tarde... 10 AÑOS TARDE
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be even worse than Insidious: The last key when it comes out.
ySy8mcceTno,WiLl BeEe BeST MoVIEs 2018 sO wiLl TEEn titAnS MOviE!!!!1!1!!!!1
ySy8mcceTno,Why is Sony always SUPER late in the game with making movies about fades pop culture
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy it's gonna suck because fans are gonna now go criticize it because it's a S O N Y movie
ySy8mcceTno,"That’s okay, this movie is only 5 years late"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a real movie
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch the Entry series by Marble Hornets on Youtube they were the ones who created Slender and it is so much better than the stories people make up
ySy8mcceTno,Manute Bol would've played the slenderman part perfectly.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony is really running out of trends to leech.
They better make a Logan Paul Suicide Forest horror movie before I graduate."
ySy8mcceTno,"El trailer no se parece a nada de lo que Slender Man podría hacer, espero y no la caguen."
ySy8mcceTno,y’all are like..... 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Video game movies are bad
ySy8mcceTno,He aquí el próximo fracaso de Sony pictures.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman  piter la anguila...
ySy8mcceTno,What about those two girls who stabbed their friend
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,"1:52
*""Hey Vsauce! Michael here!""*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks boring, uninspired, and just all around generic. Not everything makes a movie. Hollywood needs to learn that."
ySy8mcceTno,*This movie is the 2018 version of the emoji movie*
ySy8mcceTno,This will most likely be a bad movie like almost every video game movies
ySy8mcceTno,0:43 it looks like they stole my middle school drawings of Slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is this? Is this a new silent hill movie cause it sure looks like it! This movie looks soooooo trash
ySy8mcceTno,I'm surprised that I'm surprised by this.
ySy8mcceTno,An internet meme has become a movie lol
ySy8mcceTno,Striking while the iron is frozen
ySy8mcceTno,Joe Biden?  Is that you?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman is the only one tall enough to reach the cookies on top of the refridgerator
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it said Spider-Man lol
ySy8mcceTno,Noooooo! by Favor! l Can't Killeds in Usa?! O_o
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,No please no just no kill me
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay but if you forget about the name, this actually looks like it has potential to be decent movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"Please dear god get this be a joke, a VIDEO GAME BASED HORROR MOVIE, I wonder how off track the movie is gonna be with the game..."
ySy8mcceTno,Yes
ySy8mcceTno,This whole trailer looks like an opening for American Horror Story
ySy8mcceTno,SUPER EXCITED!!
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets is probably going to be better in general.
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,I should not be watching this late
ySy8mcceTno,Spayder Man.
ySy8mcceTno,"1:34
YURI NO!"
ySy8mcceTno,You're 4 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,BOIIIIIIII this brings me back to when slender first became popular
ySy8mcceTno,And the creepy pasta fandom rises from below
ySy8mcceTno,This honestly should have been made like 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,So are they gonna show his face orrr.....
ySy8mcceTno,My mom says this is a true story
ySy8mcceTno,This is lame!
ySy8mcceTno,Good one Sony... How low will you go?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like they’re trying to get by on gross imagery
ySy8mcceTno,With special guest...Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,This would’ve gotten me excited if it was still 2012...
ySy8mcceTno,Why now?
ySy8mcceTno,What’s the trend with “the woods” lately?!
ySy8mcceTno,"As bad as this movie will probably be, I can’t help but say the trailer got me low-key excited for it. I remember playing the Slender games back in the day. Curious to see what this would have in store."
ySy8mcceTno,"All that was needed was the first 0:05 seconds. I'm not interested in a Slender Man movie, so I don't care in this case, but for one, that would hype me up more than a full trailer, and two, long trailers like this show too much."
ySy8mcceTno,ya late
ySy8mcceTno,Where have u been all my life!?!?!?
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when I predicted this back in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna bring back my love for creepypasta
ySy8mcceTno,Acting looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Finally it is not a concept anymore like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years too late bud...
ySy8mcceTno,"It would be possible for them to have their own Creepypastas universe, the next movie could be Jeff The Killer"
ySy8mcceTno,The poor girl getting stabbed is more scary than this because why that actually happened why is this being made slenderman died a long time ago people.
ySy8mcceTno,oof
ySy8mcceTno,Isnt this like 7 years late? Lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Remember guys, have low expectations."
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait I’m fucking hyped
ySy8mcceTno,That looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe I would’ve liked this 5 years ago when slender man was even slightly relevant. But now? Why?
ySy8mcceTno,"You're kidding, right?"
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho
ySy8mcceTno,"Not gonna lie, this looks dope af"
ySy8mcceTno,Ah there was the gay elephant noise Marik Ishtar and Bakura told me about!
ySy8mcceTno,No can see him
ySy8mcceTno,Garbage
ySy8mcceTno,The girls that killed their friends are *QUAKING*
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is hyped for this to come out
ySy8mcceTno,I love jumpscares.  They're my favorite part of horror movies and have not been done to death.
ySy8mcceTno,This is 7 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,"I can’t wait for the sequel, Thicc Boi"
ySy8mcceTno,2022 will be Herobrine the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Irony: when Logan Paul's apology is #1 on trending and this is #2
ySy8mcceTno,This is ethier going to be really good or bad
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it doesn't suck like Annabelle Creation (Sorry if someont thought that movie was good this is my opinion)
ySy8mcceTno,I can feel the emo in me!
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer movie coming 2035
ySy8mcceTno,Massive chills all trailer long omg hell no scary af
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it’s gonna suck but eh who cares....
ySy8mcceTno,This is just enabling the psychos like those girls who stabbed their friend over and over in the name of slender man.
ySy8mcceTno,This brings me back to 2012 when horror games were actually good.
ySy8mcceTno,"very timely for the release of the movie, I'm just glad it was made before slender fell out of relevancy"
ySy8mcceTno,"Movies based on Creepypastas seem like an interesting idea, only if the execution is great! There will probably be movies based on famous creepypastas like Jeff the Killer! But all I want to see is a good horror movie that can do justice to the source material! So yeah, I’m optimistic about this one! :3"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ah crap you know how some weird challenge or event takes place when a horror movie (Charlie Charlie, Clowns) and at first it is just scaring some hired actor then escalates to some pretentious murderous psychopath trying to do the same but for real. So please Sony do not make up some weird teenage missing file for some slender man cosplay to take the credit and do it to the highest degree"
ySy8mcceTno,"A few years too late, guys."
ySy8mcceTno,does this include proxies?
ySy8mcceTno,I think we ran out of ideas for movies.
ySy8mcceTno,YASSS
ySy8mcceTno,A feature length background watching experience.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like it's going to suck big time
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, I'm more excited for the FNAF movie honestly."
ySy8mcceTno,Only about four years too late
ySy8mcceTno,What's next the SCP foundation?
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,So I’m guessing next up will be a Jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Ummmmm pretty much sinister. Nice try sony
ySy8mcceTno,This is probably the movie were slender a had two camera sense
ySy8mcceTno,OMG!! I Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,La creppy tienen futuro solo necesitan apoyo
ySy8mcceTno,"I remember back when I first heard of the Slenderman urban legend. I was a kid and was one of those kids who thought it was real. I remember how paranoid I was to walk in the woods, especially alone, and how me and my friends used to watch Marble Hornets and EverymanHybrid thinking it was all real. That's how you know an interent urban legend or creepypasta works is if it convinces its reader that it's real, than it does a good job. I haven't seen something like that make that much of an impact since the Blair Witch Project.But like the BWP, when everyone got to know that it was all fake, it kind of lost its magic, so to speak. It doesn't help that this icon, like many other Creepypasta's, has been RAPED by the fan girl community that it feels like Creepypasta/Internet Urban Legends are just a dead genre. (Although to be interestingly, the scariest and most horrible incident involving the Slenderman and its myth was a real life incident involving his psychotic fan girls). I give this movie and props for trying playing up a nostalgic fear in me, although personally if I wanted to see a Creepypasta worthy of getting a actual movie adaptation, it'd be Borrasca."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!
ySy8mcceTno,Cheeeeeesy
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? Outdated meme movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Y'all are so late lmao
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? Jeff the Killer?
ySy8mcceTno,I want to watch this RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 Gay elephant noise.
ySy8mcceTno,when I saw the thumbnail I thought this was the new venom movie lol
ySy8mcceTno,This Movie is 5 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,The manga is better...
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no no no I thought we left this in my nightmares
ySy8mcceTno,I swear scary movies are not even scary anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,At least the movie looks scary. The game was the most boring thing I've ever played.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie Will be the best movie of horror gender
ySy8mcceTno,Great job. You’re about 7 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Bro finally I’ve waited way too long.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for reals?
ySy8mcceTno,This feels like it's copying the women in black right? With the kids killing themselves and everything
ySy8mcceTno,Slim boi
ySy8mcceTno,Br aki❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,Been a while bub
ySy8mcceTno,"In about half a decade, there's gonna be an Undertale movie. Mark my fucking words."
ySy8mcceTno,Plot twist: Logan Paul is the Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,It really do be like that sometimes
ySy8mcceTno,"this looks so fucking bad, im obligated to see it tho, 2012 is apart of my childhood"
ySy8mcceTno,Where was this in 2014
ySy8mcceTno,Nope I can’t do it I cannot bring myself to watch that
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Just pay him the twenty dollah
ySy8mcceTno,"lol I thought that the title said Spider Man, I was so confused."
ySy8mcceTno,Faceless staticky boi
ySy8mcceTno,Before 1 million
ySy8mcceTno,Exactly like Bye bye man
ySy8mcceTno,WTF was literally going back to my younger self by reading creepypasta over the brake and coincidentally this movie trailer show up....a little bit freaked out right now! O_o
ySy8mcceTno,"uy no...
se nota que se les acaban las ideas xd"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ppl at Sony: yo u know what would be really clever? Using slender font.
because.
slender man. 
*everyone stands up in thunderous applause*"
ySy8mcceTno,As long as it's not a Netflix original
ySy8mcceTno,OMG HELL YES
ySy8mcceTno,They should make one with all the creepypastas tbh..
ySy8mcceTno,You're um... You're a little bit late guys
ySy8mcceTno,What!
ySy8mcceTno,"I knew it. I just knew it. This was gonna happen. Here it is.

Edit: Really? That was it? Hm..."
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,WTF THEY FINALLY MAKING A MOVIE?!?!?!?
ySy8mcceTno,Time to deliver a pizza ball!
ySy8mcceTno,Based on a true story.
ySy8mcceTno,Yah I hope this doesn’t give the wrong idea to some people if u haven’t remembered to two girls who killed their friend actually pretty recently because of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Reminds me of the ""ring"" for some reason."
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,I thought byebyeman was this?
ySy8mcceTno,DADDY SLENDER IN THEATERS 😩😩😩💦💦💦
ySy8mcceTno,CAN'T WAIT.
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone spot slender man in here? Can’t find him
ySy8mcceTno,¿QUEEEEEEEE?
ySy8mcceTno,"this feels like its all over the place..too much stuff happening. ""Less is more"" would be helpful here as this honestly feels like a generic horror movie with things in there for the sake of shock and nothing more."
ySy8mcceTno,Ok ummmmm NO.
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t think it’s that scary rn they could make it scarier lol
ySy8mcceTno,DUDE IM SO HAPPY AAAHHH
ySy8mcceTno,Great way to start the year for movies....
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf lmao
ySy8mcceTno,"Only on YouTube you can find disgusting comment sections like the one on this here video. Me personally, I feel this movie will be pretty good and I look forward to seeing what Sony has to offer within this film. The Slenderman has enough lore and potential to where it deserves a good spot somewhere within in the cinematics. I wish I can say that for the others here as well, though sadly I can't since all the commenters here are stuck in 2012 with their ignorant messages and references to outdated memes. I mean, what is this comment section? Am I somehow looking at an old pewdiepie video's comments? Ridiculous."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks absolutely hilarious.
ySy8mcceTno,🙉 🙊 🙈
ySy8mcceTno,you already know i'm seeing this omg
ySy8mcceTno,Looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,At first I thought this was fake
ySy8mcceTno,0/10 Slender Man wasn't wearing a suit in this trailer. #NotMySlenderMan
ySy8mcceTno,"Is there gonna be Masky,hoodie,kate and Toby?"
ySy8mcceTno,What year is it?!?!?!?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man? Ohhh, this is Sony Pictures..."
ySy8mcceTno,I dont think they understand the idea of Slenderman. And the trailer just looks like trash with all the cheap frame changes and disturbing visuals thrown in there just because.
ySy8mcceTno,Bye Bye Man 2???
ySy8mcceTno,Why all the eye gore 👀
ySy8mcceTno,Hot meme
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man has never been to a Buffett!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,2018: FNAF Movie
ySy8mcceTno,I didnt know this was 2011 already
ySy8mcceTno,"For those who don't get it. This version of slender is about how he is proclaimed ""a virus in your head"" and plays tricks on you. Its about what he does to your mind. How he puts fear in your body, making you progressively insane"
ySy8mcceTno,"Me: ""Oh yeah I'm totally going to watch this!""

-Girl stabs herself-

Me now: ""Nevermind then 😐"""
ySy8mcceTno,I dont really know what to think about this trailer. I guess I expected something... Different?
ySy8mcceTno,Better not be like death note

ySy8mcceTno,Ojala saquen una de jeff the killer like si lo quieren
ySy8mcceTno,Why can't people let this shitty sub par at best creepy pasta just die already
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like it’s 2013 when creepypasta and weird creepy things were all the rage, every let player played slenderman people thought herobrine was real and Jeff the killer was popular"
ySy8mcceTno,"News: Two young girls killed a student in the woods to, “Please Slendman”

ySy8mcceTno,Sonys 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell nah

ySy8mcceTno,"Well I can't play the games all the way through, so I'm not going to see the movie. Glad we talked"
ySy8mcceTno,So fake. You guys actually believe this nonsense? Grow up.
ySy8mcceTno,I'll go see that in theaters

ySy8mcceTno,"Aww wtf come on we didn’t even get to see him, yeah but he was in the dark, I want to to see the full slender man, also this is kinda late, no one plays slenderman anymore, but what ever."
ySy8mcceTno,"this is a dead internet meme, why would you release it in 2018 and not like 2011"

ySy8mcceTno,Siiiii película!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god don't bring back the horrible creepypastas.
ySy8mcceTno,looks like Sony ran out of movie ideas
ySy8mcceTno,There's no way that we are just making a movie about this
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol so many rumors of this back then, and now it comes? Wow, a little late to the party."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh it's made by Sony well that ruins all hope that really don't understand great power comes with great responsibility
ySy8mcceTno,"I really want this movie to be good but those dream sequence scene just make the plot looks not as promising as it can be.

#plzdontsuck"
ySy8mcceTno,Will it have a “gimmie twenty dollars” mode?
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought, 'Hey! This might be interesting...' - then I noticed ' *Sony Pictures Entertainment* '"
ySy8mcceTno,No wwwwwwaaasasaayyyyyyyyy and I was slender man for Halloween once I bought the mobile game and bought the console one now this
ySy8mcceTno,This would've been scary back in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh i wanna watch it
ySy8mcceTno,stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this Battle Toads?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is probably gonna suck lol
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry sir, your 8 years too late for this to be actually relevent."
ySy8mcceTno,They're only 5 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,Whackkk
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim in 00:13
ySy8mcceTno,Huh.
ySy8mcceTno,I don't remember the part in the game where he torments your mind during high school biology class.
ySy8mcceTno,lol they made slender man into a real thing
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone give me *likes* ?
ySy8mcceTno,what the hell is even going on
ySy8mcceTno,It has been done to death.  They missed the wagon on this one already.
ySy8mcceTno,This is a real movie coming out??
ySy8mcceTno,Remember the gay elephants
ySy8mcceTno,It was only a matter of time....
ySy8mcceTno,Is this even a thing now
ySy8mcceTno,For me it would have been awesome if this came out in 2012-13 you know when Slenderman was rising to its popularity now it's 2018 and no one cares about Slenderman anymore
ySy8mcceTno,Rings?
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they at least a Jeff the Killer movie. He could be the new Michael Myers.
ySy8mcceTno,What's next huh Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Save me comments😭😭😭
ySy8mcceTno,Gay elephants
ySy8mcceTno,Will this film adaptation for a famous Creepypasta Mythos be a success?
ySy8mcceTno,Gay elephants
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait to watch this with the family:)
ySy8mcceTno,*Slenderman was only shown once in the entire trailer*
ySy8mcceTno,Could we get slender oppa gangnam style???? Thank you
ySy8mcceTno,#GayElephantAt 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,"Please don't suck please don't suck please don't suck. 






Ah, who am I kidding it's Sony we're talking about."
ySy8mcceTno,I doesn't look good because Slenderman wasn't bad at all he killed kids by accident not like this
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t even know if this is legit or not
ySy8mcceTno,Who thought it was a good idea to go in a forrest?
ySy8mcceTno,This look weak
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmmmm... I am somewhat intrigued
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony: This movie is going to be great
Logan Paul: Hold my beer"
ySy8mcceTno,Has absolutely nothing to do with Slenderman. XD
ySy8mcceTno,A few years too late lol
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda surprised they had the balls to make this movie. You'd think Sony might receive some backlash tho for those girls who killed their friend.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a bray wyatt promo
ySy8mcceTno,Which Minecraft is this??
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man ain't even scary tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Me and my brothers always tried to find Slenderman. Cant wait to see the movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I liked it better when it was called ""Concrete Giraffes"""
ySy8mcceTno,We need to hear more screaming and that static sound from slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Flop already calling it
ySy8mcceTno,Just as good as Netflix deathnote
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay now there's going to a CreepyPasta cinematic universe, can't wait for the SCP cinematic universe"
ySy8mcceTno,Been waiting years
ySy8mcceTno,Is Sony so out of ideas that they just scan the internet for something and make it into a movie 3 years after it was relevant?
ySy8mcceTno,"I clicked because I thought it's said ""Spider-Man"" lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Yessss i love slender man❤❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,"Sooo, this is a horror movie??...
I prefer the HBO documentary, that is lost in time."
ySy8mcceTno,People who don't know the game gonna call it a rip off of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,Que idea tan vieja y usada
ySy8mcceTno,Like 1% of this trailer was about Slenderman; the rest is literally about some kids going crazy and throwing up tentacles
ySy8mcceTno,"That was cringey... they had a real opportunity here to make something great, but judging by this trailer they fucking blew it."
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks like absolute garbage. And it's made by Sony, so it's going to be absolute garbage."
ySy8mcceTno,Creepy pastas are turning in to movies god no original horror will always be the best but might give it a chance
ySy8mcceTno,Esto se va a ir un poco bien a la mierda
ySy8mcceTno,Whether it’s good or not marble hornets will still be better
ySy8mcceTno,gay.
ySy8mcceTno,YOUR *KILLING* YOURSELF!!
ySy8mcceTno,Sony making topical and current movies since 19__
ySy8mcceTno,"No, no sé a ustedes pero.. a mí no me asustó nadita 🤔"
ySy8mcceTno,Found a dead body in the suicide forest
ySy8mcceTno,"Let us just say that this trailer came at the worst time, if you get what I mean."
ySy8mcceTno,Do you know a little girl was stabbed because of this?
ySy8mcceTno,Can this get 5 likes? And can my latest video get 10 views
ySy8mcceTno,We dont need a slenderman movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Pues se ve bastante mala
ySy8mcceTno,La movie the jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,SPOILER ALERT: The main character collected 8 notes in the forest
ySy8mcceTno,isnt it a little late for this?
ySy8mcceTno,"2:14 
wait...
sally is that you??"
ySy8mcceTno,eh
ySy8mcceTno,How many more little girls are going to have to die or go crazy because of this?
ySy8mcceTno,Such a stranger things knockoff movies
ySy8mcceTno,"First the internet, then the movie industry, then the world"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?😂 Sorry just can't believe a creepypasta is getting a movie 😂(creepypasta is cool I'm not attacking it)
ySy8mcceTno,"The funny thing about this is that I know it'll probably be *packed* with jumpscares, but nobody will be able to complain without sounding stupid because that's all that the game did too XD"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell yeah slender ayeeeeee!!!!!! ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
ySy8mcceTno,La quiero verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr aaaaaaa soy fanatica de Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,Uhh...Isn’t this 6 years too late?
ySy8mcceTno,bout 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"It should be a movie where instead of the cliche where everyone thinks they're crazy but they aren't,  it should be everyone thinks they're crazy and they are"
ySy8mcceTno,Asthma? Just breathe lol
ySy8mcceTno,I was waiting for a Slenderman movie for so long
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, the Holy Grail of C grade movies."
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late bud
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this was just as unexpected and probably going to be just as stupid as the Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,Dear God it has finally happend...the slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was going be good but it looks cheap and not even close to it's origin.
ySy8mcceTno,"The girls who stabbed their bestfriend, They're probably dying to see this movie.








ps. please don't stab your friends 19 times, they will live and get you sent to jail.




pps. 12 year olds, this is a FICTIONAL CHARACTER MADE UP LIKE DORA."
ySy8mcceTno,"2:16 ""Is that a dead girl in suicide forest"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Don’t botch this, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Pewdiepie will love this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Seems NOTHING like the creepypasta.
ySy8mcceTno,Ruined a good movie
ySy8mcceTno,it didn't have to end this way
ySy8mcceTno,Perfect timing another forest video
ySy8mcceTno,Who else came here for the gay elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,This is fake?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks pretty trash from the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man was a creature that would kidnap children and kill them not control their mind
ySy8mcceTno,I need to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,YEEEES! Finally! \😁/
ySy8mcceTno,This Dosent need to be a movie
ySy8mcceTno,But is he in a suit tho?
ySy8mcceTno,But this meme died 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,well this is infuriatingly bad
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yeah this is totally still relevant
ySy8mcceTno,Little girls don't go stabbing your best friends
ySy8mcceTno,im pretty sure he wears a tuc with some arms in his back.... i swear i hate how movies change things up but still looks like a good movie. This should not be named slender man!
ySy8mcceTno,Welp this is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,You know Sony be desperate for money when they make movies based on Creepypastas.
ySy8mcceTno,Anybody else cringe right before that girl stabbed herself in the eye like y’all already knew she was about to shove that thing all the way in there. Am I right 😂?
ySy8mcceTno,this movie isnt scary the whole idea of a slenderman movie being a thing is already scary
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks stupid, it looks poorly done, This isn't anything like how Slenderman kills his victim. Please for the love of god don't make this."
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the trollface movie next year
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm Hype for this crap happy New Years everybody 











No I'm no talking to u"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow I didnt know it was still 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, Samara's Tape the movie trailer... so... where's slenderman's?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Maybe if we're lucky this'll end the ""hip and trending content made into movies 10 years late"" thing"
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for real?
ySy8mcceTno,"We already have one Slender Man film, no?"
ySy8mcceTno,Um....... i’m confused.
ySy8mcceTno,Look like Slenderman is an extra
ySy8mcceTno,Pewds Betta be in this movie because he popularized slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,God dammit Sony
ySy8mcceTno,3 or to 4 years late?
ySy8mcceTno,"The scary part wasnt slender man but that its a game into a movie 
And we know how its going to turn out"
ySy8mcceTno,"Crap, now they are making a movie on the Logan Paul incident. Crap.😤"
ySy8mcceTno,Annnndddd the game is officially ruined for me...
ySy8mcceTno,Aw helllllllll no
ySy8mcceTno,Nice.
ySy8mcceTno,oh. it's sony

ySy8mcceTno,Woulda been better a few years back
ySy8mcceTno,"I don't know if this is good or not.  It looks bad, but if it is good, would they make Jeff the Killer or The SCP Foundation?"
ySy8mcceTno,Lol I hope the person that first came up with slenderman gets a nice chunk of change from this.
ySy8mcceTno,I've waited so much time finally it's out yeaaaaaaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,very beginning gave me ahs vibes
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so pumped up
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh it looks like they only had a cgi budget of $5 to make Slender man appear for 2 seconds for the ending
ySy8mcceTno,5 years Late...

ySy8mcceTno,#GiveSSundeeMercy
ySy8mcceTno,Does anyone know if the original author is being compensated for his character and story?
ySy8mcceTno,"Curious to see how this goes, the best live action adaptation was the marble hornets YouTube channel, they had their own series that was fantastic"
ySy8mcceTno,15 años tarde >:v
ySy8mcceTno,So many memories of this guy like minecraft and his games plus him caught on camera
ySy8mcceTno,legend has it that Logan Paul is in those very woods making a vlog with a corpse
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be as good to the emoji  movie
ySy8mcceTno,He's still waiting for those $20
ySy8mcceTno,Should have been made 5 years ago maybe
ySy8mcceTno,"Someone finally cashing in on the Creepypasta fandom. 





My prayers are with you, may Sony for *once* not butcher (though I guess in the Creepypasta fandom butchering is pretty cool) your fandom."
ySy8mcceTno,Dislike
ySy8mcceTno,been waiting for this
ySy8mcceTno,*Shut up and take my money!*
ySy8mcceTno,looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,SI ES REAL PODIA SER UNA FORTUNA
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so extra... doesn't even look scary. Yawn.
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when creepypastas were relavent? Because i dont.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh HELL NO!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I’m expecting an FNAF movie since they’re making a Slender movie
ySy8mcceTno,Tráiler decepcionante la dvd
ySy8mcceTno,Este avance esta en verga
ySy8mcceTno,...
ySy8mcceTno,If only they made this based on slender the arrival that would have been perfect
ySy8mcceTno,"oh well, all the good scenes are already shown in the trailer. Thank you. Saved my money."
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY !
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? A Super Mario Odyssey movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Hellooooo random person scrolling down in the comments!
ySy8mcceTno,Took 3 years...
ySy8mcceTno,I never thought I’d see a real slender movie
ySy8mcceTno,It's a thing? It's really a thing?!?!?
ySy8mcceTno,"Worst scary pic trailer ever! This will flop hard!!!
And, I vow to never watch this movie upon lack of creativity, or relevance thereof"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no not this. I thought this died back in 2010.
ySy8mcceTno,Should've made this a TV series
ySy8mcceTno,anyone here from littlekuriboh
ySy8mcceTno,"You're six years too late Sony



That was the last time old Slendy was actually frightening"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they hired marble hornets for this
ySy8mcceTno,Finally... Concrete Giraffes!
ySy8mcceTno,This was lame
ySy8mcceTno,aaaaaaa
ySy8mcceTno,Man I got hype and I got this ..................
ySy8mcceTno,"O Dang, Slenderman Gets His Own Movie xD"
ySy8mcceTno,It's about fucking time they made a movie for this
ySy8mcceTno,this was long overdue
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks about as cliche as you can get, boring trailer 4/10"
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully they don't mess up on the story!
ySy8mcceTno,It barely showed Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,it only took you 8 years
ySy8mcceTno,Looks decent!
ySy8mcceTno,Just look like another non scary movie again only 1 sence that slender comes out all the rest bloody and Suicides
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeThieMovieNotSucking?
ySy8mcceTno,"Any Marble Hornet, Tribe Twelve, and or EverymanHybrid fans here?"
ySy8mcceTno,And it all started from a photoshop contest
ySy8mcceTno,1:24 was she trying to type : HI MARK ?
ySy8mcceTno,"if this were released in 2014 it would be in pretty bad taste. uh, good job... i guess."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they made a movie on this subject
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it doesn't suck like the other video game movies.
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,YASSSSSSSS ALSSOOOO anybody else belive in him or just me ._. Hes not that bad once ya getto know him
ySy8mcceTno,It's funny how they're trying to capitalize on something popular from 2012. You're totally keeping up with the times Sony!
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,I'm good with playing slender on roblox
ySy8mcceTno,"So...basically the newest IT but instead of Pennywise, it's Slendy. Alright."
ySy8mcceTno,Oh look a film that’s going miss the entire point of slender man and is just going be a cash grab
ySy8mcceTno,When is the fnaf movie coming out 😢
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 Did I just hear a gay elephant?
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder how that poor girl who got stabbed and her family feel about this
ySy8mcceTno,"I didnt think they would do this, after that slender man stabbing years back"
ySy8mcceTno,About time
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like the game is more scary.
ySy8mcceTno,"For those who don't know, this film was actually filmed 8 years ago and was formally titled as Concrete Giraffe"
ySy8mcceTno,2011 wants their movie back.
ySy8mcceTno,It's 7 years late because in 2014 two 12-year-old girls plotted to killed their best friend (the young survived 19 stab wounds)  to please slender man the case just closed in November of 2017.
ySy8mcceTno,I️ swear to god if they don’t put a 30 minutes let’s play in the middle I’ll be so mad
ySy8mcceTno,Marble hornets is better than this
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG, A SLENDERMAN MOVIE.
Except I’m past that phase of Creepypasta and I already saw a film that had Slenderman (I don’t remember what is was called but I do recall seeing it on YouTube). Plus, I can’t trust Sony after the Emoji Movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a movie that is so hype but when it releases it has bad reviews
ySy8mcceTno,"NOPE
no
NAH
STOOOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
BLOCKED"
ySy8mcceTno,1:41 you can see slendy in the top right corner
ySy8mcceTno,Yes please
ySy8mcceTno,Ummmm ain’t you like 6 years too late for this
ySy8mcceTno,"*In a lenarr voice*

""AHHHHHH LEAVE ME ALONE, LEAVE ME ALONE, Leave me alone, i swear ill beat you up""
😂😂"
ySy8mcceTno,Those scenes they always have in horror movie trailers with the people's faces moving around really fast always crack me up for some reason and I don't know why
ySy8mcceTno,Who remembers the fake teaser for a slenderman movie years ago? Along with the Jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Back to the Old days with new age producing... love it !!
ySy8mcceTno,About...four years late
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna to be interesting!
ySy8mcceTno,Se prendio esta mierda.
ySy8mcceTno,Best movie of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome !! Second AMERICAN HORROR STORY 😈🔥
ySy8mcceTno,"Ngl, that kid in the hospital bed had some seriously good acting skills! Sorta hyped for this one!"
ySy8mcceTno,Suave
ySy8mcceTno,"From random internet story to major motion picture...this world is incredible. Often stupid, but incredible"
ySy8mcceTno,I have mixed emotions
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Hard to believe this all started with a Photoshop contest. :/
ySy8mcceTno,Im sorry hollywood your 5 years to late.
ySy8mcceTno,Please be fake
ySy8mcceTno,Tengo hambre.
ySy8mcceTno,"Should have left it as a video game. 
1:34 Knife -> Face"
ySy8mcceTno,"Though this looked alright, the baby laugh at the end though....its the bloody baby laugh ringtone and now i can't take it seriously XD"
ySy8mcceTno,This was filmed in my school #what
ySy8mcceTno,Yesssss
ySy8mcceTno,Too late tbh
ySy8mcceTno,this looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,Thats not how slenderman works. Its going to be a terrible movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"despues de 84 años e visto un trailer que no es fake :""""""""v"
ySy8mcceTno,Me quedo con marven sabe que
ySy8mcceTno,Is YouTube tryna flip us off or something?Really we tell you what Logan Paul did was wrong and you put three videos about people in woods and even dying in woods Bad Timing YouTube!

ySy8mcceTno,FINALLYYYYY A SLENDER MAN MOVIE!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,On way 2 30 subs
ySy8mcceTno,Oof its Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, this looks like it has potent-
*Sees Sony 
Nevermind."
ySy8mcceTno,"Well I’m kinda disappointed... 
I wanted this movie to be a lost footage film ( even though its been pretty over done) because, to be honest it would sense if you know about slenderman.This just seems like a modern horror movie that’ll get a 73% on rotten tomatoes."
ySy8mcceTno,YESS
ySy8mcceTno,what a waste of money
ySy8mcceTno,Spotted Slenderman 13 times throughout the video lol.
ySy8mcceTno,Nice
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like we're only gonna get one glance of slenderman through out the whole movie.
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 ish NOOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all about a decade behind on this
ySy8mcceTno,can I get likes just for being here
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY. THIS TRAILER GIT TRENDING.
ySy8mcceTno,The #CanYouSeeHim must mean John Cena instead of Slender
ySy8mcceTno,slenderman es mi creepypasta favorito
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things 2.0?
ySy8mcceTno,"THIS IS THE THIRD SLENDERMAN MOVIE, YO"
ySy8mcceTno,She killed herself in class?
ySy8mcceTno,This actually seems good.  Good job sony
ySy8mcceTno,"Who thinks Ticci Toby or Jeff The Killer are next ??






My Bets on Jeff and Slendy will have a cameo or something in it"
ySy8mcceTno,They're 5 years late with this movie
ySy8mcceTno,He gets in your head oh wait were they talking about Sony watch out sony is THE slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,All we need now is a outlast movie then we'll be set
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else excpected to actually see him in this trailer? :/
ySy8mcceTno,YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS SLENDER DAD MY BIRTHDAY IS NATIONAL CREEPYPASTA DAY
ySy8mcceTno,I always call my friend slenderman because she's really tall when i found this Video i screenshoted this and send it too my friend with the caption a movie about you 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Dead memes
ySy8mcceTno,Who is slederman?
ySy8mcceTno,"Nope, not falling for this one. Especially if this is the same guy who made ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer""."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is about 6 years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,Thought it said Spider-Man at first glance. I don't even know why I would expect a spider man movie this year besides the animated one
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Hype.  Please god don't make this movie shitty
ySy8mcceTno,JEFF KAPLAN PLAYS IN THIS?!?
ySy8mcceTno,laaaaaame
ySy8mcceTno,its not 2012
ySy8mcceTno,They show the victims more than slender man
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next Jeff the Killer Movie or a Sonic.exe Movie
ySy8mcceTno,lol
ySy8mcceTno,Meh.
ySy8mcceTno,This would of been way more famous like 4 years ago 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,Isnt it kinda to late for this
ySy8mcceTno,4 years late
ySy8mcceTno,YES. Slender Man has Finally Arrived
ySy8mcceTno,I
ySy8mcceTno,Ehy
ySy8mcceTno,"This was pretty scary. To cool down, can I offer some daily waffle videos?"
ySy8mcceTno,AYYYEEEEE
ySy8mcceTno,"Outside of having the same name... this has nothing in common with the slenderman character.

The original character was written off the feeling of being watched in the middle of a forest even though there was nothing there, and was simply a creature that was incredibly tall, impossibly skinny, had no face and would actively hunt for children lost in the woods to take  them away.  Then it got added on somewhere that he had shadow tentacles.. But at no point did he infect your mind with a virus."
ySy8mcceTno,"Help, comment section, please save me!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Just stop. Please don't release this, just erase all progress, this is going to be the worst thing, worse than the Emoji Movie. Just give up, please!"
ySy8mcceTno,This literally looks like aids 😂
ySy8mcceTno,not kind of my movie I would c.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hello 2009
Please leave."
ySy8mcceTno,Dan Howell's worst nightmare
ySy8mcceTno,*Who else thought it said “spider man” in the thumbnail?*
ySy8mcceTno,"Really? I knew there were talks to make this, but those were years ago, back when Slender Man was still relevant. Eh, maybe it could be good. Apparently, the Marble Hornet series is decent so we might as well see."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it was made by a high school student.
ySy8mcceTno,CREEPYPASTA GANG WHERE YOU AT?
ySy8mcceTno,They should have made this in 2009
ySy8mcceTno,Finnaly
ySy8mcceTno,Couple years too late Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone ask for this? Like seriously slenderman hasnt been a thing since like 2012
ySy8mcceTno,What if that YouTube Logan dudes suicide forest video was low key a promo gone wrong for this :OOO
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,is this 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,It’s about time
ySy8mcceTno,Its about time
ySy8mcceTno,Cash grab much?
ySy8mcceTno,goosebumps
ySy8mcceTno,"my outside me said,"" DONT WATCH IT!!"" my inside me said,""LETS WATCH IT AT NGHT!""  i goin have nitemares tonight"
ySy8mcceTno,Se la batimamaron :( se ve que la súper mega cagaron
ySy8mcceTno,It's about fucking time.
ySy8mcceTno,"honestly, for what it is, it looks ok. But it is Sony Pictures, so expect the worst (however, the new animated spider-man movie looks great)."
ySy8mcceTno,There was already a slender man movie and it was surprisingly good
ySy8mcceTno,I got all the drugs in the world that u need
ySy8mcceTno,Oh boy cant wait to see the Slender fangirls squealing
ySy8mcceTno,Remember the Slender Man Stabbings...
ySy8mcceTno,Your boi slendyyyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,7 years later...
ySy8mcceTno,*It's about time...*
ySy8mcceTno,Whack
ySy8mcceTno,Why?
ySy8mcceTno,Lemme guess after this we have the whole Jeff runs away into the forest and meats slender man? Then The Who smile dog incident? I mean I’m glad not lying but if they do that I don’t know how it would go....
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Like Game like Movie
ySy8mcceTno,looks pretty good
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man Slender Man all the children try to run

Slender Man Slender Man to him it's part of the fun

Slender Man Slender Man dressed in darkest suit and tie"
ySy8mcceTno,i would’ve been more creeped if it came out like 5 years ago... ya know when the topic was trending??
ySy8mcceTno,The start of the creepypasta EU
ySy8mcceTno,"Didn't realize the video game had to do with demonic possessions, high school anatomy class, and graveyards."
ySy8mcceTno,nah bruh im good
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to suck I know it
ySy8mcceTno,I really don’t know how I feel about this. Kinda equivalent to the fnaf movie coming out. Or trying to revive an old meme.
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, Jeff the Killer?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Lest make a horror movie, lets call it Slenderman,

But... Hi only is in the trailer like 2 scenes

Yooooooour fiiiiiiireeee!"
ySy8mcceTno,"I like how everyone is saying this movie looks bad, but then in the end it turns out to be a good movie lmao."
ySy8mcceTno,This is so stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"Who would win?

An entire town/cities police force and detectives.

One skinny boi."
ySy8mcceTno,Esto nunca superara a las creepypastas :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Lol this looks terrible, as expected"
ySy8mcceTno,"I like how the trailer's simplistic. I honestly don't expect much from a slenderman movie (considering the first one), but the aesthetic is somewhat minimalist, the soundtrack goes quiet at the end, it doesn't look ugly. Who knows. Maybe this will be fucked up in an okayish way. also, what was in her hands at the end? why wouldn't they show that, I wonder? I WANT THIS TO BE FUCKED UP. Slenderman is more creepy than he is scary nowadays - I actually have a little, itty, bitty, bit of hope that they'll play it cool."
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this going to be a thing
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated film of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late.
ySy8mcceTno,"Was actually kinda excited for this when I saw the title, but less than a second in my excitement was killed by two words: *Sony Pictures*"
ySy8mcceTno,La wa descargar ilegalmente xdxdxd
ySy8mcceTno,Finalmente !
ySy8mcceTno,Your late
ySy8mcceTno,"A few years late, aren't ya sony?"
ySy8mcceTno,Dont make a movie based on a creepypasta please
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry, you're a few years too late"
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look that good to be honest
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully it’s not bad I hope they include the papers
ySy8mcceTno,"wow,  they actually made slenderman ""somewhat"" scary"
ySy8mcceTno,2020: FNAF: The Movie
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Delete this
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this said ""Spider Man"""
ySy8mcceTno,2018 is going to be the year of the shitty creepypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus christ sooo excited
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be terrible and we all know it
ySy8mcceTno,Quien es slenderman...? :vv
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG YES! There should totally be an SCP movie, that would just be awesome. Or a full sequel of creepypasta movies!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry mates this isn't 2010, you're a little late on this one. I hope they start making movies out of much better creepypastas like The Showers."
ySy8mcceTno,2012 vibes
ySy8mcceTno,Ooof
ySy8mcceTno,Wow. Makes Fifty Shade look like it's gonna be an Oscar contender this year
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for my FNAF movie
ySy8mcceTno,:v Hola estoy aqui depositando pacmans :v en tendencias :v ayudarías a nada dejando un Like :v Gracias rufián ;v
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man gangnam style 2
ySy8mcceTno,"As someone who grew up with slenderman being apart of my childhood, i will love to watch this movie. :) hope its good."
ySy8mcceTno,8 years to late sony
ySy8mcceTno,First the emoji movie. Now Slenderman. Can’t wait for the Pepe animated film next year.
ySy8mcceTno,A lot of wood related stuff lately in the trending list
ySy8mcceTno,I thought we left slender man to die back in 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Aw nah
ySy8mcceTno,"I am not joking. I accidentally clicked this without knowing, and as soon as I read what it was I started laughing for a straight minute. What's next? FNAF? Oh wait..."
ySy8mcceTno,Ooooo I can't wait for this to come out OwO
ySy8mcceTno,For a second I thought it was Jake Paul
ySy8mcceTno,2 years too late?
ySy8mcceTno,Yes slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Lost interest once I saw Sony
ySy8mcceTno,"Somebody *PLEASE* make a YTP of this video and please name it ""Slender Meme"""
ySy8mcceTno,finally he gets his own movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Al final no vemos cómo es el aspecto de Slenderman, solo vemos una sombra oscura, si el aspecto de el a cambiado y no lo vemos con un traje, una persona blanca sin ojos, alta , creo que podría resivir varias críticas muy malas, pues los fans de verdad estarían muy decepcionados por que, si es un orgullo que hayan echo una película, pero tuvieron bastante tiempo en elaborar su aspecto original o algo parecido.
Bueno esa es mi opinión aunque la película todavía no se haya estrenado, todavía no sabremos el aspecto de el."
ySy8mcceTno,https://soundcloud.com/georgeq305
ySy8mcceTno,Wow the forest is a great place to be these days
ySy8mcceTno,where’s my cinnamon ALS ice bucket challenge movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"That marching sound around 0:30 is really creepy for me because when I was maybe 9 or so, I used to hear a sound like that when I was trying to sleep. It went away, but it still sort o haunts me."
ySy8mcceTno,"How do you do, fellow kids?"
ySy8mcceTno,Does it have 009 dreamscape as the main sound track
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood must be running out of ideas if they are going to make movies based off of internet stories.
ySy8mcceTno,A horror game that can literally be summed up in 3 sentences and Sony makes a movie of it...I give up.
ySy8mcceTno,Didn’t beat Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,Why the hell is this getting so many dislikes?
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepypasta memes!

Coming soon.."
ySy8mcceTno,I don't see Pewdiepie screaming anywhere in this trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,aw man its not the live action minecraft musical!
ySy8mcceTno,"We finally find out where the 8 pages came from 
With Gore, Full frontal face shots, flashing screens WITH BLOOD AND DRAMATIC bWaAAs!!!!
im so excited."
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone who tries to see this will be stuck in a theater with autistic 10 year old markiplier fanboys screaming the entire time.
ySy8mcceTno,"#2 on trending, right next to Logonio Paulio's apologio."
ySy8mcceTno,Memes
ySy8mcceTno,"im kinda dissappointed

where the pages is my main concern..ah hahh

and also it doesnt fit up with the story(ies) 

doesnt feel as eerie .

i mean he should be taking little kids not the grown ones ;;-"
ySy8mcceTno,A bit too late of the Slender train fellas
ySy8mcceTno,horror movies are a joke these days
ySy8mcceTno,1:21 Spastic head movements? Seriously
ySy8mcceTno,"Uh I think 2011 called, they want their meme back."
ySy8mcceTno,called 2009 and they want their creepypasta back
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Who's next? Jeff the killer? Or Smile.dog?
ySy8mcceTno,The people at Sony have apparently been in a coma for 6 years because they still think Emojis and Slenderman are what all the cool kids are into.
ySy8mcceTno,Nope
ySy8mcceTno,sony missed the hype train by about 7 years...
ySy8mcceTno,Looks awful.
ySy8mcceTno,I cant wait to watch this!
ySy8mcceTno,Unimpressive and uneven first look.. :/
ySy8mcceTno,YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
ySy8mcceTno,"Fail, this doesn’t match the legend of slender"
ySy8mcceTno,"Honestly it’s not a bad trailer and I’m thankful they’re not focusing on slender man in the trailer because let’s face it he’s not that scary.  Plus the lack of any real information in relation to the monster and how it operates allows us to go in blind.  I hope it’s good, but I also think it’s a good idea to lower your expectations."
ySy8mcceTno,slender man fan girls are quaking
ySy8mcceTno,"He’s gonna be in the movie as long as Spider-Man was in avengers, difference is it wasn’t Spider-Man’s movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Thanks for reminding me I haven't finished binge watching Marble Hornets for the third time. Going to do that instead of watch this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,So fucking hyped
ySy8mcceTno,im S H O O K
ySy8mcceTno,Is this going to have anything to do with the slender man inspired attempted murder?
ySy8mcceTno,I excepted him to come out with anime eyes
ySy8mcceTno,Yes! Creepypasta needs love
ySy8mcceTno,I heard Logan Paul comes out in the forrest
ySy8mcceTno,You just can't keep a good creepypasta down!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad it's unreal.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh?
ySy8mcceTno,"Make A Jeff The Killer Movie, Like If You Agree"
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,"Roses are red
Violets are blue
Omae wa mou
Shindeiru"
ySy8mcceTno,I hope they have a Jeff the killer movie or at least reference him in this one
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this was coming
ySy8mcceTno,Ehhhhhhhhhhh i always wanted this
ySy8mcceTno,This... looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,I am wondering will the proxies be introduced into a live action role as well like in a sequal maybe?
ySy8mcceTno,i wonder if the person who originally made that internet creepypasta is super pissed that they don't get credit
ySy8mcceTno,Ring rip off plus this doesn't even look scary at all. It looks boring.
ySy8mcceTno,0/10 Not enough idubbbz dancing to gagnam style 👎👎👎
ySy8mcceTno,"Can we please just go back to 2016, back to simpler times. 2018 seems like its the year of cancer."
ySy8mcceTno,With a special feature from the 2 crazy kids
ySy8mcceTno,Walked in the woods found a dollar found a dollar
ySy8mcceTno,Aquele filme foda...
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman where are yoooooooooooou?
ySy8mcceTno,Here before I million views
ySy8mcceTno,Number 2 on trending right behind Logan Paul saying sorry five time in one minute.
ySy8mcceTno,1:20  ??  WTF  is happening with him
ySy8mcceTno,El creepy pasta es muy malo pero quizás la película sea buena
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm going to give it a try. Other than these cry babies. Wonder if they do this when an Iphone comes out. ""ANDRIOD ALREADY HAD THAT FEATURE IN 2012"""
ySy8mcceTno,Did this really need a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine how rich that random guy you called a troll on 4chan is going to be?
ySy8mcceTno,This is basically stranger things but with slender Man and girls
ySy8mcceTno,HE'S A DEAD MEME AT THIS POINT. WHY?
ySy8mcceTno,It’s a bit late imo
ySy8mcceTno,"No, we don’t need this, NO!"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like Bye Bye Man but taller and probably even worse.
ySy8mcceTno,"Just like suicide squad 
The only character people wana see whill barely be in the movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"HELLO, WISCONSIN..."
ySy8mcceTno,Khe berga :v
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm sorry, I must have missed the gay elephant sound, can some one help me find it? I thought it was supposed to be around 1:22"
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean this movie is kinda late buuut, still cant wait for it man."
ySy8mcceTno,"One time the name ""Slenderman"" popped into my head right when the electricity went off in my house and it scared the crap out of me"
ySy8mcceTno,I live right in front of the woods. I’m gonna have so many nightmares.
ySy8mcceTno,MemerMan The Movie Coming Soon
ySy8mcceTno,Prepare the memes we ride tonight!
ySy8mcceTno,La cagaron
ySy8mcceTno,Venom?
ySy8mcceTno,C'mon dude you just saw what those two girls did to the other girl in Wisconsin. I feel like this is just going to make things like that happen more.
ySy8mcceTno,That little girl who was nearly murdered by her friends in the name of Slender Man better not get wind of this
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the dlc?
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is everyone trash talking this movie even if its a dead meme, it looks pretty cool and scary."
ySy8mcceTno,"tbh it doesnt look that good from this trailer, looks like itll mostly be scary imaging and boring dull moments and the lack of color isnt all that good looking here but it is the first trailer so idk."
ySy8mcceTno,God damnit
ySy8mcceTno,Tenia que ser el Sony >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Why does the forest remind me of suicide forest
ySy8mcceTno,ITS ABOUT TIME
ySy8mcceTno,"Great. At this rate of being late, we'll get a mannequin challenge movie in 2050.

Edit: Remember, these were the same folks who brought the emoji movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Brought to you by the good people at Sony
ySy8mcceTno,¤
ySy8mcceTno,The whole thing with the girls stabbing the other girl for ‘Slender Man’ happened in my town. No joke. Now they have to go and make a movie about him. Looks like some more nightmares for me!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it sucks so bad honestly🤔
ySy8mcceTno,another flop movie on his way 🙊
ySy8mcceTno,"what’s next, huh...? bendy and the ink machine?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Who else came here after watching Brittyy44 

Edit: Wow thanks for 3 likes"
ySy8mcceTno,Its so bad..
ySy8mcceTno,"I guess you can say this movie is





Wiping the smirk off my face (and my eyes and nose)"
ySy8mcceTno,remember when he was relevant... 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,welcome to NBA
ySy8mcceTno,No it’s a Sony film
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh for fuck's sake, they are really running out of ideas"
ySy8mcceTno,7 years from now theres going to be a movie called The Pauls about you geussed it Logan paul and Jake paul.
ySy8mcceTno,Esa no me la esperaba xdxd
ySy8mcceTno,Cool
ySy8mcceTno,If you go 1:23 you can hear a gay elephant
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a good horror film worth seeing (besides IT and Get Out. That’s bank right there 🤑
ySy8mcceTno,Who else is watching this in 1892?
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t ruin slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Hell...It's about time
ySy8mcceTno,Waited so long and we get this?  WTF
ySy8mcceTno,Looks sooooo badass but still waiting for the venom trailer 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Wot
ySy8mcceTno,"oh, word? this pasta is from like 2009"
ySy8mcceTno,Should've ended the trailer right around 1:50.
ySy8mcceTno,Ay dios que miedo
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they are going to make a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,They should’ve made this movie like five years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting 6 years for this
ySy8mcceTno,John Cena would be perfectly casting for become slender man
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG WHHYYY are they bringing back slenderman.!!! THAT ERA IS DONE WITH!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see how Sony fucks up this one.
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn't there already a slenderguy movie that bombed
ySy8mcceTno,It + Stranger Things = SlenderMan
ySy8mcceTno,"Great marketing Sony, exploiting a traumatic event a little girl had to go through for profit. Did you ask Logan Paul for the idea?"
ySy8mcceTno,I love it i love it!!! I am in love with creepypasta and I have been waiting for this to come out for forever.
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t be the only one who thought I saw Spider-Man instead of slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Definitely ready for this!
ySy8mcceTno,"*Espere algo grande pero sale esto después de 6 años ponen esto*

*No me gustó :'v*"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks just as terrible as every other ""horror"" movie thats come out in the last 10 to 15 years."
ySy8mcceTno,Why.
ySy8mcceTno,This doesn’t seem to be the best idea considering the suicide scene and how suicide is a major topic right now due to Logan Paul’s disrespect of a person who killed themselves not to mention the horrible thing that was done to the girls who was stabbed by people acting like her friends.
ySy8mcceTno,"I laughed through this entire trailer, mainly out of disbelief. How could anyone possibly think this would be a good idea??"
ySy8mcceTno,Another movie about a game lets hope this one doesn’t suck
ySy8mcceTno,Aguevo
ySy8mcceTno,Old Memes make crappy movies.
ySy8mcceTno,There is no such thing as Slender man he is not real like seriously
ySy8mcceTno,I'm just wondering that why the marker is making that sound like i didnt know they make such sounds on glass...
ySy8mcceTno,Again YouTube basically puts an ad with less than half a million views in the trending tab
ySy8mcceTno,🙄
ySy8mcceTno,Sony will for sure screw this up
ySy8mcceTno,Looks horrible. I’ll wait until Sonic.exe or Cupcakes hits the big screen.
ySy8mcceTno,I thought games would remain games but Hollywood decides to take that to a whole new level...
ySy8mcceTno,"about 5 years late on this zeitgeist Sony, nice try"
ySy8mcceTno,"7 years too late, tbh this movie can be fixable just replace slenderman with a Teletubby"
ySy8mcceTno,Holy
ySy8mcceTno,When I saw the thumbnail I thought it said SpiderMan 😂
ySy8mcceTno,1:16 remind me to never give her a marker in class
ySy8mcceTno,I think I speak for the majority when I ask: Why though?
ySy8mcceTno,Sleennnndddyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,No no no no why are you making a movie about him
ySy8mcceTno,It's been more than half a decade since the slender man trend. It's about time!
ySy8mcceTno,7 years late guys
ySy8mcceTno,Who is hyped!
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like the movie doesn’t have anything to do with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man is now a woman or I did not understand the trailer, WTF?"
ySy8mcceTno,Meme Central
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe A Bit TOO LATE.
ySy8mcceTno,#Canyouseehim?
ySy8mcceTno,We all have those times
ySy8mcceTno,Random fact. My neck hurts from bad form in pilates :( The front of it hurts! The front muscles in my neck. WHYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,Remember that time two girls stabbed their friend 19 times for Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,"When you dont have ideas and uses games to make movies 
Sony: WHAT A GREAT IDEA!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,Really?
ySy8mcceTno,wtf is this trailer. this movie is gonna be garbage
ySy8mcceTno,The fact that slender man is not in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Looks eh. Prob gonna be a bust
ySy8mcceTno,"Flashback a few years ago

Wouldn’t it be funny if there would be a Slenderman movie?



 Now
Hmmmmmm"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not a fan of creepy pastas, but for the sake of the fans... Let's hope they get Slenderman right... Like lore wise, They better get him right..."
ySy8mcceTno,"Grabs popcorn, ""Ooooooohh Booy can't wait for the memes to come out for this movie"""
ySy8mcceTno,Oh my goshhhh
ySy8mcceTno,"next on trending - Five nights at freddys movie, bendy and the ink machine movie, undertale movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Mmm spicy
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be my new favorite tentacle hentai.
ySy8mcceTno,"it's one thing for bad timing since it's 6 years too late for the slender man hype, but when this came out after logan Pauls suicide forest video, that's just worse"
ySy8mcceTno,Because movies about memes nearly a decade after they've peaked and started to fizzle out released a week before one of the most anticipated sci fi movies of the year of one of the most popular movie franchises in the world always works out well in the end.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry, Marble Hornets beat you to the punch with this one."
ySy8mcceTno,"Using a poor girl's death for fictional ""horror"" movies? lol Burn, Hollyweird. You're all destined to burn."
ySy8mcceTno,Did they find the eight pages tho?
ySy8mcceTno,My name jeff
ySy8mcceTno,Really nailed the timing there Sony...
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf dude 2012 is over man! Come on!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a great movie IDGAF I'm watching this
ySy8mcceTno,Is everything on trending have to refer to the Woods...like the irony of everything omg🤣🤣🤣🤣
ySy8mcceTno,"creepypastas have so much potential to be turned into amazing horror films, and im hoping this one turns out good"
ySy8mcceTno,Yes DADDDYYY😩😩
ySy8mcceTno,Maaaaan
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, so I am confusion."
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait.
ySy8mcceTno,Great. More stories that are going to traumatize me and my grandkids
ySy8mcceTno,:V ya era hora?!
ySy8mcceTno,my expectations for 2018 have plummeted
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of Logan Paul in the woods 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Tanto tiempo esperando, soy miedoso pero que importa por mi personaje favorito :D"
ySy8mcceTno,Why did they show a cataract surgery?
ySy8mcceTno,Bruhhh I kinda don’t get slender man and this movie how are they the same not here to Agrue
ySy8mcceTno,If only Logan Paul could have seen him that day in the woods...
ySy8mcceTno,Hey Logan Paul went to these Woods
ySy8mcceTno,So... will this fail?
ySy8mcceTno,Que wea???
ySy8mcceTno,It was only a matter of time...
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna see him in the suit
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if they found any dead bodies in the forest here?
ySy8mcceTno,"Yeah, Sony Pictures Entertainment is only about 5 years too late..."
ySy8mcceTno,So you're making a film adaptation of a video game character that has inspired multiple kids to go out into the woods and kill other kids? Brilliant.
ySy8mcceTno,que mamada?....santo jesucristo en bicicleta goku bulma picoro¡¡¡¡¡¡¿¿¿ e esperado esto desde que tengo memoria :v
ySy8mcceTno,"its good but then, idk its just kinda to late. :|"
ySy8mcceTno,"*Plot Twist*

Logan is actually the slenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,Those girls who stabbed their best friend are HYPED
ySy8mcceTno,Hope this one doesn't suck
ySy8mcceTno,*sighs* I can't believe they are making a slender movie
ySy8mcceTno,Wouldn't that be Brandon Ingram from the lakers
ySy8mcceTno,From Sony pictures the same company that brought you the emoji movie brings you slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"*Realeses trailer for new Slender Man movie*
*Shows nothing but a silhouette of said Slender Man for 2 seconds*"
ySy8mcceTno,They're gonna cancel this and come out with the fidget spinner movie.
ySy8mcceTno,I would rather suffer through watching thw bye bye man
ySy8mcceTno,Quick someone find the 8 pages before he gets here! XD
ySy8mcceTno,Don't forget sigma radiation
ySy8mcceTno,This is when u know Hollywood has gone down hill
ySy8mcceTno,what.....WHAT!?!
ySy8mcceTno,*I can't believe that Sony Pictures approved this movie and yet still have not greenlit the Popeye movie*
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a meme? Who in their right mind would make a movie about a shitty copypasta from nearly a decade ago? What's next a Ben Drowned HBO miniseries? A Lavender Town Syndrome movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"By making this movie,you're spreading the infection.Slenderphobia manifests this...thing and by everyone being obsessed with him,it creates a physical thing in this world."
ySy8mcceTno,Dead people & a forest
ySy8mcceTno,Who else but Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Hay algunas cosas que tienen que quedarse en solo leyendas:u
ySy8mcceTno,PewDiePie?
ySy8mcceTno,soy uno de los primeros en ver el trailer lol esta epico
ySy8mcceTno,When you’re so unoriginal you reuse shots from earlier in the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,"Ravioli
Ravioli
Give me the formuoli"
ySy8mcceTno,i'm looking forward to the Harambe biopic in 2025!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This is accutualy happening?
A movie based on Slender Man.







F@*k Fnaf. I'm using my money to buy a ticket for this."
ySy8mcceTno,even the trailer sucks
ySy8mcceTno,A Slender man movie wow no one knew slender man to 2011-2018 wow
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else remember the fan trailers back when Slenderman was actually popular? Or better yet the marble hornets series
ySy8mcceTno,You a little late aren't ya?
ySy8mcceTno,WTF
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,SONY UR FUCKIN UPP
ySy8mcceTno,Thank the MEME LORD!!!!!UIUwdhque43e
ySy8mcceTno,Is there gonna be a Creepypasta Cinematic Universe now?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Baby part 1
ySy8mcceTno,A tad late
ySy8mcceTno,"De una vez se los digo, un fracassoooo :)"
ySy8mcceTno,This attempt number 2at a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,"when are we gonna discontinue the ""Pale white girl w unruly hair and a white nightgown"" cliche in horror movies? bc it's literally irrelevant to the slenderman franchise"
ySy8mcceTno,slender man hasn’t been popular since like 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Me siento como en 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Idk looks boring
ySy8mcceTno,noice
ySy8mcceTno,lmao why
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,I think this trailer is what it looks like in a woman’s mind when she’s on her period
ySy8mcceTno,Oh cmon..it's like every other horror movie now
ySy8mcceTno,I hope its not r rated
ySy8mcceTno,Almost as late as the angry birds movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Aye you❗️❗️❗️ 
I promise our group better then your favorite artist go check out our songs and lmk if u believe me or not 🗣😁"
ySy8mcceTno,"Regardless of how late this movie is, it actually doesn't look half bad."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie with white people.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender was like in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Looking forward to seeing this on Jeremy Jahns Top 10 Worst movies of 2018 list
ySy8mcceTno,bout friggen time
ySy8mcceTno,OMG yeeees i have literally waited so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,Que confusão...teve uma hora que pensei estar vendo o trailer do chamado
ySy8mcceTno,LIIIITT!!
ySy8mcceTno,Mmheee
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Lmao, you guys are like 10 years too late."
ySy8mcceTno,"What is this, minecraft?!?!?"
ySy8mcceTno,WOW! THIS IS GOING TO BE A CROWING ACHIEVEMENT IN HORROR CINEMA! BOW DOWN BEFORE SLENDERMAN?
ySy8mcceTno,Dank
ySy8mcceTno,0:59 And the Oscar goes to...not anyone in this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope they make this good, little jump scares, a lot of slender men I;the background, watching where the view can see him, but the protagonists cant"
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yea
ySy8mcceTno,you know it's quite sad that instead of hyping up the movie the community hypes up the memes more instead.
ySy8mcceTno,**CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE**
ySy8mcceTno,*WELL ITS ABOUT TIME*
ySy8mcceTno,1:24 when you're asked who your favourite powerpuff girls villain is
ySy8mcceTno,"As someone who gets scared easily, after seeing so many shitty Youtubers play Slender Man, I don't see there being any way this movie can be scary."
ySy8mcceTno,2018: The Year of the Forests of Death.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is going up the trending list
Slender Man's coming for Logan Paul"
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the static??
ySy8mcceTno,My boy He's back
ySy8mcceTno,"Y con este filme, se dara pie al universo cinematografico de los Creepypastas?
Genial"
ySy8mcceTno,Ten years late
ySy8mcceTno,Is this another emoji movie?
ySy8mcceTno,TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH!
ySy8mcceTno,"wow, didn't many teenage girls died  because of this meme? also this movie is years late on this trend..."
ySy8mcceTno,I played the game and couldn't leave my room what makes you think I can watch the movie
ySy8mcceTno,A couple years too late sony 😂
ySy8mcceTno,who would have thought a creepypasta would be a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,So yall payin @marbethornets or nah?
ySy8mcceTno,"If a Creepypasta shared universe is made, what stories should they focus on? I think Slender, Jeff, the Rake, Eyeless Jack, and Ticci Toby."
ySy8mcceTno,What?
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets did it better
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,ermahgerd
ySy8mcceTno,Is it a coincidence that everything on trending is about a forest
ySy8mcceTno,"The only thing which is related to the game, is the name of the film.
Seriously, ¿when are this hollywood people gonna learn how to base a good videogame into a movie?
Well, understand me when i say ""good videogame""... I'm not serious with that lol."
ySy8mcceTno,He's a infamous creepypasta.
ySy8mcceTno,My inner 12 year old is incredibly excited
ySy8mcceTno,About 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,They don't even have the classic thunder sound that plays when he gets closer or the camera could have been cut off for effect or something geez. like whats with the maggots? This is not worthy of dead meme revival WHERE IS THE STATIC?
ySy8mcceTno,"This would have been exciting like 5 years ago, Hollywood is so behind the times. Also anything that’s remotely scary about slender man stems from his being this urban legend, once you canonize it with a dumb horror movie he really is just another lame excuse for a jumpscare"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is very intriguing, slender man has always been a cool subject when you dive deep into the lore."
ySy8mcceTno,"O sí, llamen a Deimoss, Deigamer, iTowngameplay, Bersgamer, Dross,  German del 2011, Zora, Keyblade, Zellendust, Sharkness,RubiusOMG, Fernanfloo y todos los creepypasteros, que se viene el mayor Hype/Miedo, por la pelicula del mayor personaje de Creepypasta junto a Jeff The Killer!



          ¡YEAH!"
ySy8mcceTno,uhh this looks so un-put together
ySy8mcceTno,SONY WHY
ySy8mcceTno,*Better 7 years late than never*
ySy8mcceTno,Welllllll frick
ySy8mcceTno,Of course this is from Sony
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was supposed to be a crappy History Channel documentary
ySy8mcceTno,When you’re over 5 years behind the rest of the internet.
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks like it would be a good movie and all, but it really doesn't really relate to the original Creepypasta. Plus, since this IS Slenderman, people should see the operator symbol (⨂) in the town/village AND in the room in 0:42; the kids who in counter Slenderman should have the Slender Sickness, the sickness consisting mostly of coughing fits and coughing up blood, along with occasional nausea, paranoia, and extreme exhaustion due to an encounter and being stalked by the Slenderman. Other then that, I must be honest, I would rate the trailer a 4/10. Sorry..... :/ *shrugs*  Hope you use this info. As this should be related to the games, the other movies and the original Creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,I’m kinda excited to see how this movie turns out but I feel like they made this movie a little too late don’t you think?
ySy8mcceTno,Dunno bout this trailer...
ySy8mcceTno,I see Logan Paul in this forest ! 😂
ySy8mcceTno,The most hyped movie of 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,"This reminds me of the bye bye man movie but with little girls killing there friends, a few years ago there was a story on the news about two girl that killed there friends as a sacrifice for ""Slender Man"". At least Slender man gets a back story that he deserves now"
ySy8mcceTno,Your about 4 years late on this one sony
ySy8mcceTno,It was only a matter of time
ySy8mcceTno,Wow something else about the forest... Great timing am I right. Maybe they’ll even find a dead body!
ySy8mcceTno,Hype!
ySy8mcceTno,Saw this on Facebook and thought it was fake cus the story line had me lost asf
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,epic win for gamers stand up gamers
ySy8mcceTno,Will?!
ySy8mcceTno,Some images looks like the ring video tape!
ySy8mcceTno,"I for one am very excited for this new twist on ""Concrete Giraffe"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmm lets see. Im guessing a 60% on rotten tomatoes, 3 stars on imdb, and 4.5 stars on Amazon when it hits prime two months after release."
ySy8mcceTno,*Who’s ready for the memes from Grandayyy or Dolan Dark to appear now?*
ySy8mcceTno,where is slendy man suit
ySy8mcceTno,"This just in, 2048 and fidget Spinner the movie due out in theaters in 2024 right after Dab the movie followed by Planking in 2025."
ySy8mcceTno,O boi here we go Again
ySy8mcceTno,no se se me hace muy amateur.
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh come on SONY for god sake stop. First you do the emoji movie, then a video game version of Jumanji now this- a movie nobody asked which is about a fucking game which has no fucking story. Have some fucking respect for the art of cinema ffs."
ySy8mcceTno,Lord Jesus help me sleep tonight!
ySy8mcceTno,🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
ySy8mcceTno,As soon as I saw Sony I checked out!
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets already did this
ySy8mcceTno,QUE PEDO!?
ySy8mcceTno,PUTA QUE PARIU! OLHA O BICHO VINDO
ySy8mcceTno,Sony You Just Had To.............
ySy8mcceTno,Yesssssss
ySy8mcceTno,Hhehehahahhrhehahhheehehheehahahaha
ySy8mcceTno,I think it would be better if they made it like the game with fp view with slender man because there’s barley any clips with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Well this movie is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,This looks messed up
ySy8mcceTno,Hey nobody wants this now give us Popeye
ySy8mcceTno,So now they made a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna be a lotta kids killing their friends after this....
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yeah. I was waiting for this
ySy8mcceTno,Dis is fake
ySy8mcceTno,No thanks.
ySy8mcceTno,WTF I THOUGHT THE RUMORS WHERE FAKE!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"On one hand, the concept this movie is based around is vague enough to have an outcome of a great, terrible, or just downright bland horror movie. Problem is that it's SONY Pictures that are making it."
ySy8mcceTno,The game was enough
ySy8mcceTno,ya era hora!
ySy8mcceTno,This honestly looks good
ySy8mcceTno,They had to do this
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting for a Jeff The Killer Movie
ySy8mcceTno,WHY?!
ySy8mcceTno,Finally this has got to be good
ySy8mcceTno,This better not disappoint
ySy8mcceTno,8 years too late m8.
ySy8mcceTno,Really? Is this a joke?
ySy8mcceTno,"We did it boys!

Thank you reddit, 4chan, and SomethingAwful forums!"
ySy8mcceTno,vaya puta mierda tete
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman wears a suit
ySy8mcceTno,Is it 2012 already?!
ySy8mcceTno,Should have come out years ago. Slender man is old news
ySy8mcceTno,No way they are making a movie about slender man that’s nuts
ySy8mcceTno,"Cant judge by the trailer but all im saying is, it better be good"
ySy8mcceTno,"Why are they doing this? Seriously, there’s no reason. It’s like six years old."
ySy8mcceTno,If this movie had been produced before the slender franchise was mercilessly murdered by the fnaf series it would definitely be a lot more popular. But I do see this to be a good movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Now all we need a Pepe movie
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Gangam style the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,old meme
ySy8mcceTno,"Next movie by hollywood 
My name is JEFF"
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda excited? I kinda want it to be a indie marble hornets type feel with the budget of a blockbuster. But its probably gonna be bad and bring back edgy creepypasta ocs and a Jeff The Killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Gay elephant sound is at 1:23
ySy8mcceTno,#notmyslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,MY CHILDHOOD THE MEMORIES THE CREEPYPASTAS THEY'RE COMING BACK
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for this movie to come for soooo long
ySy8mcceTno,Is slender man like a mental plague
ySy8mcceTno,I dunno... The plot better be compelling otherwise I might as well stick to the original creepypasta stories.
ySy8mcceTno,Needs a better name...Sounds like a Marvel Super Hero with the power to waste peoples time and money.😂
ySy8mcceTno,Rumor is Chris Chan is playing slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Let the memes begin
ySy8mcceTno,This is still happening nowadays.....
ySy8mcceTno,This looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,"WTF, is this actually disturbing???"
ySy8mcceTno,satanic horse crap
ySy8mcceTno,I thought slenderman fan base was dead
ySy8mcceTno,whoever edited this trailer should be fired
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Bit late to the party arent we... why am i going to go watch this... i know i am.
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the eight pages......I’ll wait.
ySy8mcceTno,The slender man looks like the monster from miss peregrines home for particular kids.
ySy8mcceTno,">Slenderman movie
>Sony

Shit's gonna suck"
ySy8mcceTno,They’re a couple centuries behind this movie should’ve been made a decade ago when slender man was cool and actually scary
ySy8mcceTno,This would have been relevant in 2014
ySy8mcceTno,They made a movie?
ySy8mcceTno,i want to see this movie but i am scared!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Thank you for this it better be good
ySy8mcceTno,OMG FINALY A REAL FILM NOT A CRAPPY MARBLE HORNET RIP OFF THAT DIDNT GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL!!! YASSSS!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Next movie jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,I can scare myself with my own breathing but this as a horror movie trailer was meh
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh
ySy8mcceTno,"And next on the List, Rake, Jeff. Hell, Hollywood could just milk millions out of Creepypastas"
ySy8mcceTno,why is everything so shitty now?
ySy8mcceTno,I knew it was a good idea to not kill myself yet
ySy8mcceTno,Not a single jump scare in the entire trailer 🤔😱 Well at least that's something
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next? SCP the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait!
ySy8mcceTno,I see memes coming
ySy8mcceTno,PewDiePie better do a review of the movie lol
ySy8mcceTno,Can the next horror movie about a creepy-pasta be about the SCP Foundation.
ySy8mcceTno,When you thought this stupid fad died in 2014
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for five nights at Freddy’s in 2026
ySy8mcceTno,"i hope they make references to the slenderverse (MarbleHornets, everymanhybrid, Tribe 12, Darkharvest, etc...)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Let's see how many people try to kill their best friends as a sacrifice after seeing this. For those who don't know what I mean, I'm referring to the slender stabbing that was years ago involving those females."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally jeez
ySy8mcceTno,"Ehh, wi catch it on Netflix when there’s nothing else to watch."
ySy8mcceTno,It's time to stop
ySy8mcceTno,NO FUCKING WAY BROOOOOOOOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,My 2012 self is hyped up about it
ySy8mcceTno,Okay this looks terrible....what’s next Jeff the killer vs Jane: Deadly Romance?
ySy8mcceTno,Watch out you might see Logan Paul filming in the back.
ySy8mcceTno,little late to the party.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh man I can't wait to sacrifice my best friend while reading Stephen King's IT and laughing as a maniac like Harley Queen 😂😂👌💦💦🅱️👌👌😤😫😫🤔👌👌👌😫👌🍆
ySy8mcceTno,My innocent childhood has been stolen once again
ySy8mcceTno,THE DREAMS ARE TRUE. ;D!!!
ySy8mcceTno,What if those girls who tried to murder her friend watch the movie 🤬😂🤯
ySy8mcceTno,Finally I Benn waiting for years
ySy8mcceTno,7 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I bet this movie is going to be like the Blair witch project
ySy8mcceTno,The movie is named after me yet I’m not seen in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,I use to be scared of SlenderMan lmao back when I was little of course
ySy8mcceTno,"I just finished watching ""Peter La Anguila"" lmao. I think Peter is related to the Slender man"
ySy8mcceTno,I want to see the girl stab her self in the eye 🤗🤗
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 CAn anyone else hear a gay elephant?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real
ySy8mcceTno,Like really lets just remind that poor girl that was stabbed by 2 girls about that horrifying incident all for entertainment...
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony Pictures, train wreck inbound."
ySy8mcceTno,"Way too late Sony, your late"
ySy8mcceTno,Offffical and hopefully no spoliers!
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey uh Sony, I think you meant to release this movie in 2013."
ySy8mcceTno,The girl who got stabbed by her friends is probably not gonna watch this
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman Gangam styles
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been telling my friends about it but they did not believe, but tomorrow I'll be the one laughing now :P"
ySy8mcceTno,So wheres the infamous camera?
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,That's not how slender man works.
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be good I've played the game it's scary
ySy8mcceTno,That cinematography is heat tho not even gonna lie
ySy8mcceTno,Would've loved if they had the heavy thump sound
ySy8mcceTno,"Where is Jeff and the proxys 




This is a joke because now you have to say that"
ySy8mcceTno,I am officially not an atheist
ySy8mcceTno,This is what happened in the woods before Logan Paul laughed at all the dead people in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the memes
ySy8mcceTno,Why tho???
ySy8mcceTno,bout time!! pretty cool they changed him or movie would be boring
ySy8mcceTno,YOOO
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like it has nothing to do with slender man but ok Hollywood you do you
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yeah
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY! I’ve been waiting for a Slender Man movie for years!!
ySy8mcceTno,un poquito tarde no? Digo no?
ySy8mcceTno,How old is this again?
ySy8mcceTno,This would’ve been great 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Cringey
ySy8mcceTno,AFTER 4 YEARS
ySy8mcceTno,Well...I didn't think it would even get past into the production phase but...HERE IT IS.
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t it a little too late to make a movie about slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, now Hollywood is going to sensationalize the acts of two little nut jobs who watched too much YouTube?  Way to go Hollywood."
ySy8mcceTno,"Here is my prediction. It will be better than Always Watching. It will be far worse than Marble Hornets, TribeTwelve, EverymanHYBRID, and all the others I forgot to mention."
ySy8mcceTno,"I don’t like how the trailer to be creepy by just  barraging the viewer with constant unsettling audio and visuals, as redundant a statement as that may be. Which will likely not correlate to how the film really is"
ySy8mcceTno,Next is the Sonic.exe movie!
ySy8mcceTno,EVERY SLENDERMAN FAN AND CREEPYPASTA FAN IS OBVIOUSLY WATCHING THIS AND FANGIRLING!!!
ySy8mcceTno,bruh sony is 4-5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"The only scary is the ""official"" in the title."
ySy8mcceTno,Woot woot
ySy8mcceTno,Justo estaba viendo el crepypasta de slenderman xd
ySy8mcceTno,"Idk man the idea of this seems cool but I'm worried about the execution, the trailer seems kinda meh"
ySy8mcceTno,"Either this is a horribly done trailer that doesnt accurately represent the movie at all or this movie is going to be so bad we might forget about the emoji movie for awhile, if it's the latter I hope cinemasins does a video on it"
ySy8mcceTno,There should have been Gangnam style music in the backround
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t she know that he only moves when you look at him?! #videogamelogic
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it's gonna be a mess.
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for this since 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Man I remember when I first discovered Slenderman. Kept me paranoid for months.
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like I remember once seeing a slender man movie on one of those movie apps where you can see any movie
ySy8mcceTno,Get ready for an fnaf movie next
ySy8mcceTno,Wow they actually did it
ySy8mcceTno,About time slender man was my game back in 8th grade.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a bad joke
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I've been waiting for this no  one believes me that slender Man the movie is coming all the other trailers are fake and fan made😱😱😱😱
ySy8mcceTno,It's finally happening
ySy8mcceTno,It's like they don't even understand the appeal of the original slender man creepypastas. It was being stalked in the distance by some mysterious being with unknown intentions that made people go missing and/or insane when being hunted by him. He's not just another monster creature with mind control powers.
ySy8mcceTno,Just let it die
ySy8mcceTno,Just what we need for 2018!!!
ySy8mcceTno,WHAT THE FIRST CREEPY PASTA TO BECOME AN MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,2018 is starting off with a fresh meme
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger Things+Insidious+Death note= this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Omg :0
ySy8mcceTno,"Just watch, there's probably only going to be a single reference to Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,Looking forward to the Goat Simulator movie. You know that's coming up next 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Sei não rick mas parece falso
ySy8mcceTno,At 1:55 it sounds like the loud moaning meme just scary lolll
ySy8mcceTno,What year is this? 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,I just hope this movie’s watchable
ySy8mcceTno,This looks kinda lame
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp, I decided to go to the woods and camp during Christmas break, but now I think I ain't going."
ySy8mcceTno,You're about 6 years late...
ySy8mcceTno,You mean that game from 2011????
ySy8mcceTno,Like 6 years too late but k
ySy8mcceTno,RIP headphone users
ySy8mcceTno,Why.... just why
ySy8mcceTno,well lets hope the movie will be better than the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Dam I wonder if after this movie they'll make a Jeff the killer film and after that them put them up against each other
ySy8mcceTno,Que karalhos e esse Giovana
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE?
ySy8mcceTno,Why slender is skinny as hell tho? XD just askin’
ySy8mcceTno,Can we have a Spiderman vs Slenderman movie now?
ySy8mcceTno,The creepypasta fandom died a long time ago but this has me hype hopefully they comeback!
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY
ySy8mcceTno,whats next a live action octodad
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's good... It just doesn't look like it will be haha
ySy8mcceTno,This is like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like pandering garbage and pushes aside what actually makes slenderman scary in favor of more movie goers. looks like a pass for me unless i hear something new
ySy8mcceTno,The scariest part of this trailer was when the word sony appeared.
ySy8mcceTno,Now is this the start of the creepypasta cinematic universe?
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta cinematic universe?
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes when I think of slender may I think of psychological horror. Not a guy wearing a suit with no face who steals children. I mean only an idiot would think that, right."
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf did i just watch?!
ySy8mcceTno,Titanic 2's next
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,Slender ya pasó de moda
ySy8mcceTno,no fucking way lmao
ySy8mcceTno,I can wait to see this and i love it
ySy8mcceTno,"Seriously, Hollywood?"
ySy8mcceTno,It looks meh
ySy8mcceTno,way too fuckin late to make a movie bro
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting for this movie since the 3rd grade, it better not be trash..."
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s hope it isn’t bad
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there will be dozens of scenes where slenderman is somewhere hidden in the background and years later we will still find new scenes where he can be seen
ySy8mcceTno,So we gonna have creepy pasta movies now or.... cuz I’d rlly like to see one on that one lady who’s lips were sewn together. I forgot her name
ySy8mcceTno,Hmnn judging by the trailer nothing is related to Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"So fuking loud, I hate you sony"
ySy8mcceTno,*wow*
ySy8mcceTno,A few years late Hollywood
ySy8mcceTno,I thought slender can never have a movie because in the game he brings static to the camera
ySy8mcceTno,"Well......







How was everyone day??"
ySy8mcceTno,yassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
ySy8mcceTno,Tails doll: the movie
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait I can't wait I CANT WAIT
ySy8mcceTno,2025: Five Nights at Freddys
ySy8mcceTno,What’s with everything on trending being about death in the woods?
ySy8mcceTno,Brasil por aqui..👁️
ySy8mcceTno,I can think of two girls that will love this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Es neta que mierda.
ySy8mcceTno,#NotMySlenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Dose anyone els think that this movie is going to suck bad after watching the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Hey this would have been cool in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Hey i dont remember slender man giving people magots i mean he is a killer but he is not that durty
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, it's time to stop.  



It's gone. It's dead. It's old. 





*why*"
ySy8mcceTno,"In my perspective, the first eight pages game really lacked a plot on why your there. For the duration of the game you would just find pages and watch slender man reappear as your progressing. I feel as though it may lack material about the pages and the symptoms of the slenderman, but I do think it will do well"
ySy8mcceTno,What happened at the beginning with rhe puncture thing?
ySy8mcceTno,Is psy slender man making a cameo?
ySy8mcceTno,I've never fast forwarded through a movie trailer :( until now.
ySy8mcceTno,Br
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for the trollface movie
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,So much potential... please let it be good
ySy8mcceTno,Holy s*** is this real because I really want to see it
ySy8mcceTno,Here before 1 million views
ySy8mcceTno,creepy visuals=good horror movie trailer according to Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad omg
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m kind of mad at this. You took one of my favorite, most nostalgic games and turned it into some shitty movie that’s just like every other horror movie ever. You completely took away my childhood. (As a teen) Kind of looks like a rip off of stranger things as well."
ySy8mcceTno,wtf is it 2012 again
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,"*movie trailer voice*  Next summer, the fight you never expected.  It's Somara.  It's Slenderman.  It's the grudge girl...in a three way dance for the title of...Creepiest Tentacle Spector Monster!"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s my b day can I plz get some subs
ySy8mcceTno,"And...whats has this to do with that tall creature who kidnaps kids?..
I dunno, i got vibes from everything but the original creepypasta"
ySy8mcceTno,"I mean, it was gonna happen.  It's a good idea for a horror movie and all, but you guys are a bit late."
ySy8mcceTno,Bro no this isn’t gonna happen
ySy8mcceTno,"I think I'll stick with Marble Hornets and their successors (TribeTwelve, EverymanHYBRID, and the like). Thank you."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman be like;




*MY MOVIE IS LATE.*"
ySy8mcceTno,SLENDDDDDYYYYYYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,# you can see him
ySy8mcceTno,You all know slender man but to you know the giver
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,So how many girls are gonna kill their friends?
ySy8mcceTno,"I heard there was gonna be a slender movie, but I didn’t think it was true, I have mixed feelings about this."
ySy8mcceTno,Now I see 2018 is gonna be a bad year
ySy8mcceTno,where is my son I can not find him
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wat till it com's out in thethers
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,*HEY GUYS PEWDIEPIE HERE BACK WITH ANOTHER SLENDERMAN LETS PLAY*
ySy8mcceTno,(○__○)
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh god, no pls"
ySy8mcceTno,i thought it said spiderman
ySy8mcceTno,So did the creators even read the creepy pasta or play the video game about him? Seems like they didn’t at all lol
ySy8mcceTno,Looks scary I'm waching it
ySy8mcceTno,This should've been #1 on trending since Logan paul is YouTube's class pet his shitty apology video is on number 1 that's trash
ySy8mcceTno,I wonder if Logan Paul will make a cameo in this movie and finds a dead body
ySy8mcceTno,remember your past movies remember that movie about a trip to the moon it was impressive how they were able to make something like that with such rudimentary tech and a golden vision about flying among the stars remember the way the titanic captured the hearts and minds of a generation remember the golden age of disney animated movies and how they provided wholesome kids entertainment with genuine quality and passion hell i'm not even a movie guy but i don't want it to end like this at least hitler got the dignity of a bullet from a gun and hitler did way worse why do you want to end such a promising form of media in such a sadistic fucked up way as this
ySy8mcceTno,This gives me vibes from 'The Ring'
ySy8mcceTno,"I really dont think this would be a good movie because of the following reasons

1. Does not seem like it would follow the creepy pasta as it was

2. Its sony, the people behind ghostbusters 2016 and the emoji movie. I think it is safe to say that they are not competant people.

3. This ""slenderman"" idea has went unpopular for years now.

4. When it comes to horror trailers, i have seem multiple trailers the exact same way as this. You are pretty much able to point out now what would happen in the trailer and when. It also seems like a cliche trailer for how many times people tried this way of putting a trailer together.

Anyway, thats what i thought. I know people dont care about my comment but im putting it here anyways."
ySy8mcceTno,"This is spicy, I guess..."
ySy8mcceTno,So what started as a joke 5 years ago is now being turned into a movie and it’s not even decent. Looks like he’s just a figment of the imagination and not even a real person
ySy8mcceTno,The hype
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh,yes I've been waiting for this horror move for ever finly"
ySy8mcceTno,what is with the woods this week? everything about the wood is trending
ySy8mcceTno,Is the girl at the end a proxy
ySy8mcceTno,Love those Ooga booga fingers and the gay elephant noise at 1:23.
ySy8mcceTno,this was like 10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,All the fanmade trailers that has been created i cant take a legit ONE serious lol
ySy8mcceTno,a little too late for this dont you think?
ySy8mcceTno,well well well... we meet again
ySy8mcceTno,looks better than Always Watching lmao
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,I had not missed this one 😂
ySy8mcceTno,"6 años tarde, lo de hoy es ""dir Daivid"""
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf!!!im waiting for the fidget spinner movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I made a movie kind of like this, but instead of Slender Man, it's called Shyster Man. It's about a Jewish lawyer that steals your shekels."
ySy8mcceTno,They should of made a movie of Jeff the killer!
ySy8mcceTno,They should've made most of it happen in the woods like the game
ySy8mcceTno,What did I just watch😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Will Logan Paul make a cameo, where he’s making YouTube revenue by filming a corpse?"
ySy8mcceTno,I LOVE SLENDER MAN I PLAYED THE FIRST 8 PAGES
ySy8mcceTno,"Straight to DVD?

96% rotten tomatoes?"
ySy8mcceTno,Unregisteredhypercam2
ySy8mcceTno,Just get this right Sony. Slender man makes no noise. Just static on electrical devices. The Slender sickness causes insanity. That's what will cause noise
ySy8mcceTno,This isn't 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"A little too late Sony, slender man got taken over by five nights at Freddy's sadly."
ySy8mcceTno,This is a joke .....ri ri ri right
ySy8mcceTno,"I really enjoyed the Slender games, but this just looks stupid."
ySy8mcceTno,"Logan Paul #1 trending apologizing for filming a dead body. 
Sony makes a movie about a fictional horror character that convinced 2 girls to try and kill their friend & it's #2 trending. Sick & disgusting. Will be boycotting."
ySy8mcceTno,Good movie for *EDGELORDS*
ySy8mcceTno,WHY NOT SLENDER GIRL HUHHH! HUH!
ySy8mcceTno,"Like this if anyone had nightmares back in the day when slender man was a trending game! 


Read More"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm actually so fucking excited for this.
ySy8mcceTno,Ohh
ySy8mcceTno,"Better as...gay man 😂😂





21"
ySy8mcceTno,is this going to be full of ads too?
ySy8mcceTno,Splenda man
ySy8mcceTno,THIS IS NOT AN ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF SLENDER MAN! 😡
ySy8mcceTno,all of the clips doesn't make any sense.
ySy8mcceTno,"Dang, I didn’t know I was back in 2013..."
ySy8mcceTno,"IN 2016, WE GAVE YOU TITBUS... I MEAN GHOSTBUSTERS.
IN 2017, WE GAVE YOU THE SHI... I MEAN THE EMOJI MOVIE.
IN 2018, WE PROMISE TO PRESENT YOU WITH OUR LATEST CASH GRA... I MEAN FEATURE FILM: FUCKER MA... I MEAN SLENDER MAN."
ySy8mcceTno,Too late men
ySy8mcceTno,meme already dead
ySy8mcceTno,Looks garbage
ySy8mcceTno,A Herobrine movie would have been cooler. Just Saying.
ySy8mcceTno,This gave me awkward goosebumps
ySy8mcceTno,"Did we need it? no. Did they own it? yes. I don't understand why film studios are so out of touch and unoriginal now. Just bring in the fresh minds, you're killing your company off."
ySy8mcceTno,I’m looking forward to this movie only because slender man was the first horror game I’ve ever played and I fell in love with it ever since. And now THERE IS A MOVIE ABOUT IT!!! Now I am excited!
ySy8mcceTno,This movie seems a bit too brutal.
ySy8mcceTno,I have no idea what this is but have heard about it for ages . Is it meant to be scary ?
ySy8mcceTno,His face looks wonderful in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry, marblehornets is 100x than this at a millionth of the cost"
ySy8mcceTno,Ew gross.
ySy8mcceTno,Will there be a respawn button?
ySy8mcceTno,This needs to die now
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the part where logan paul is?
ySy8mcceTno,What is this???? JIM HOPPER???
ySy8mcceTno,:o ohh
ySy8mcceTno,no da miedo
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood is really running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,Ive see way to many dead people in the woods this week
ySy8mcceTno,"Just because the word Slenderman is spaced out ""Slender Man"" I'm going to call this movie ""Lanky Dad"" from now on."
ySy8mcceTno,WHaaaaaaaaaaaa-AAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTT????!!!!!!!!!!????????
ySy8mcceTno,I love how they made it not about slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,*Flashbacks to 2009*....
ySy8mcceTno,What's next Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,Hey you know what better late than never!
ySy8mcceTno,"Whats next, jeff the killer the franchise :v"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dang, I wish Blumhouse could've got in on this."
ySy8mcceTno,Omfg they took the meme too seriously
ySy8mcceTno,BUT WHYYYYYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait until they start making minecraft roleplays about this....
ySy8mcceTno,IT > Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,The Gay Elephant Noise! 1:23 Yay!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn’t there a movie called “ Entity” about slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not kidding, this is litteraly stranger things."
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the Killer is next
ySy8mcceTno,😱
ySy8mcceTno,"2013 called. They want their trends back 



1980 called me. They want their joke back"
ySy8mcceTno,the game is ded but okie
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, this doesn't look the best but it certainly doesn't look the worst. One of the main points that I really like about this trailer is that it seems the movie is turning more towards the effects of Slenderman and how it psychologically gets in to your head which is a really nice way to go about it. I'm a huge fan of Marble Hornets (the OP's of Slenderman), and it seems like the creators of this movie paid attention to what made the content so scary. They are going less with spooky, bad makeup and CGI SCARY TALL MAN GUY THAT WILL CHASE YOU and going with the more laid back, unknown kinda concept where you don't see him a lot in the main points of the movie (which is super important to the Slenderverse). I tend to like these styles better because it makes your imagination try to fill in the blanks which in all makes things more creepy and dark. I'm excited by this! But I know that it could be a really hard SWING or a MISS and while I am kinda happy about this, I understand it can be really disappointing."
ySy8mcceTno,What’s the plot??
ySy8mcceTno,Heh
ySy8mcceTno,Six years late sony.
ySy8mcceTno,The manga was better.
ySy8mcceTno,If slenderman dont have a suit in the Movie i will get into the woods and buy some clothes for this motherfuc*er
ySy8mcceTno,"1:05 First Stranger Things,now this?!?!?She must love beinb tormented"
ySy8mcceTno,God yes
ySy8mcceTno,They should leave these kinda movies to Guillermo Del Toro
ySy8mcceTno,"a sony movie
its going to be TRASH"
ySy8mcceTno,I need to see this
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing like cashing in on some hot memes... years after they went cold...
ySy8mcceTno,When will they learn that video games shouldn't be made into films. 😒
ySy8mcceTno,6 years OLD!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Is this really happening
ySy8mcceTno,It's the  joke ?
ySy8mcceTno,This genuinely looks bland and uninspired. Should’ve just had the premise of the game with a single person in a forest being followed by Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time Slender Man got a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Um
ySy8mcceTno,"I almost feel like Always Watching did a better job on this with a smaller budget, and it sucked. Marble Hornets will always be the best in my eyes."
ySy8mcceTno,YESS  FINALLYYYY
ySy8mcceTno,"Dont read i wrote something stupid







Something stupid"
ySy8mcceTno,this looks really bad. and late.
ySy8mcceTno,wonder what marble hornets thinks of this....
ySy8mcceTno,I remember 8 pages how not to be scared you play epic sax guy
ySy8mcceTno,There probably all feminists so let them die
ySy8mcceTno,Bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary
ySy8mcceTno,I’m guessing slender man is gonna find Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,"Well I should have know better not to watch this at night, now I'm paranoid"
ySy8mcceTno,Movies based on games hardly ever go right... Let's see how this is.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm just here for the gay elephant.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a shitty fan made film. Also 6 years late..
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be as bad as the Marble Hornets movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Guys this is such an old trend please just let it die already.
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for the Jeff the Killer biopic after this....
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad
ySy8mcceTno,"They already made a ""Slender Man"" movie: *Always Watching: A Marble Hornet's Story (2015)* & *Tall Men (2016)*"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,I want a jeff the killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this ligit
ySy8mcceTno,Is that John Cena?
ySy8mcceTno,Ha ha how’s it goin Bros my name is pewwwdiepie
ySy8mcceTno,How you gonna make a movie on a teleporting dude with tentacles and no face that only moves when you're not looking at him and kills you when you do?
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok YouTube why is #1 on trending apologizing about filming a dead guy in the woods, #2 a movie about literally killing people in the woods, and #3 man in the woods. Bad timing YouTube"
ySy8mcceTno,Slen’s come a long way since creepypasta. Congrats my dude. First you got a video game. Gotcho own movie now. I see you.
ySy8mcceTno,2011 called... They want their game back
ySy8mcceTno,Who wants an SCP movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"I never liked slenderman. Too many dumb, horror, myths when it only originated from a photoshop project. At the same time there is nothing that relates to the game other than the woods being the main setting. It’s going to be bad."
ySy8mcceTno,"Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 




Lol"
ySy8mcceTno,This is really ironic... Logan Paul makes an apology about what he did in the suicide forest and then Justin Timberlake makes a video about the woods and now slender man killings kids in the woods?! What’s next? New movie..: The woods..?!
ySy8mcceTno,Is Logan Paul gonna be in the movie? Since it has to do with dead bodies in a forest.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,This should be #1 trending
ySy8mcceTno,this looks so cool
ySy8mcceTno,"Even though this movie will probably suck, people are still going to go see it just to see how bad it is. Same thing happened with The Emoji Movie and that made a ton of money because of it. So this may as well."
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the Slenderman creepypasta died out years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,inb4 more stabbings
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 8 years too late considering they were going to make the slender man movies like 6 years ago and the slender and hype is dead. I also heard he’s not even gonna be in the movie...
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah totally new game
ySy8mcceTno,Iconic.
ySy8mcceTno,Cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,Please stop before all the edgy creepy pasta kids rise from the dead
ySy8mcceTno,💩💩💩
ySy8mcceTno,Let's just hope it's not as bad as the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta Cinematic Universe!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"Pretty sure this movie is about the two young girls who lured another girl into the woods to stab her to appease slenderman, because they thought he was real, instead of the actual game...and that makes it highly exploitative"
ySy8mcceTno,A little too late
ySy8mcceTno,"You mean Slender Man is still a thing?  I thought a movie would be shied away from, given what happened with the two girls who tried to stab that other girl to death for him.  One thing I got out the trailer is that Slender Man is barely in his own movie, and most of the deaths will be from other people."
ySy8mcceTno,No one asked for this.
ySy8mcceTno,"Very good
Esta muy genial"
ySy8mcceTno,Hi spooky tall white guy
ySy8mcceTno,wow just saw this after looking at logang pauls apology
ySy8mcceTno,spookay
ySy8mcceTno,*Cadê os br krl kkkk slenderman tá puto tá atacado é valaaaaaaa*
ySy8mcceTno,"The slender man is a good idea, and it looks like this movie shits all over that. The trailer shows more than even the entire movie should, and relying on jump scares makes for a forgettable movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Spoiler Alert: some girl will be killed by two classmates
ySy8mcceTno,Why are they going into the forest and people die? Did they set this up to send out this trailer at this time?
ySy8mcceTno,"Why didn't you make this in 2011 or 2012, people have moved on."
ySy8mcceTno,Despues de 5 o 4 años creo :v
ySy8mcceTno,Holy hell that looks awesome! I'm so excited!
ySy8mcceTno,Now more girls are going to stab their best friends! Yay.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY!!! But a few years late
ySy8mcceTno,"wow, this looks pretty good tbh. the cinematography looks fucking great ((better than that its watching movie or whatever)), defiantly not gonna torrent this when it comes out."
ySy8mcceTno,looks awful
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie I know the lore of
ySy8mcceTno,This looks suprisingly good.
ySy8mcceTno,So when are we getting a Outlast movie?
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, late by 1,583,846 years late"
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so excited for this. I used to play the game all the time as a kid and acted like a badass because of it
ySy8mcceTno,Whack.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a GCSE Media student made the trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul wil find slender in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,I Thought i was a Fan made
ySy8mcceTno,No way what
ySy8mcceTno,"2011 called, they want their trend back"
ySy8mcceTno,Wait... wasn’t there a kickstarter for a Jeff the Killer movie a few years back?
ySy8mcceTno,Meh it’s looks alright
ySy8mcceTno,Wow holleywood just wow
ySy8mcceTno,"Look guys, a movie 6 years too late"
ySy8mcceTno,This is Hella ironic 😂 cough cough logan paul
ySy8mcceTno,the real slender man right here https://youtu.be/cVW9N3WLskc
ySy8mcceTno,I hope we see an Asian guy hanging there
ySy8mcceTno,remember the last time someone made a movie on a creepypasta.... this one will turn out greaaat
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 sorry Marik and Bakura said there was a gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,"Really, bro"
ySy8mcceTno,"Es va hacer una pinche mierda, a como se ve se mira que solo se trata de unas pinches adolescentes que se suicidan o hacen algo de muerte y a slenderman lo ponen como si fuera una influencia mas"
ySy8mcceTno,"How'd you guys mess up such a simple premise? I never saw any of this nonsense when collecting pages in the forest. IN THE GAME. you guys could've done this in the vein of Blair Witch with a person or group of people reading creepy stories on the internet who for some reason or another feel compelled to go out to the forest and prove whether it's real or not. And as the film progressed, showcase some epic and gruesome kills in the film. That would've been 100x more accurate and horrifying. But you all decided to through rational thought and make a cheap plot."
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 *gay elephant noice*
ySy8mcceTno,AYE caramba
ySy8mcceTno,HYPE
ySy8mcceTno,i was literally thinking to myself a week ago if there ever was going to be a slender man movie and now i press on the trending page and BOOM there it is
ySy8mcceTno,I’m so glad they aren’t showing much of him
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone ask for this
ySy8mcceTno,Ya era hora prros >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Redbox
ySy8mcceTno,But is it... LORE FRIENDLY?!
ySy8mcceTno,Nah
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,WOW Is Amazing This Movie When Out?
ySy8mcceTno,Wait... What?
ySy8mcceTno,The twist is that the evil asshole in the woods is actually Logan Paul.
ySy8mcceTno,Yawn
ySy8mcceTno,I think if they tried giving it a detective approach it would at least be salvageable
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like another sequel to the Ring than a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Idea sounded dumb to me, but this trailer makes it seem more like a psychological horror movie then a, ""Oh, no! It's the Slender Man!"" type thing"
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully that one girl that stabbed her friend doesn’t hear about this
ySy8mcceTno,WHERES THE SUIT MUFUKA
ySy8mcceTno,I came here for the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,YASSS MY FAV CREEPYPASTA HAS A MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? A movie about Troll face chuck norris riding a fidget spinner while dabbing and yelling deez nutz trying to save the world from Harambe and Pen pineapple apple pen with his sidekick dat boi?
ySy8mcceTno,"they gave a creepypasta a movie





*A F U C K I N G M E M E*"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no... They made a moive of him...  Oh CRAP...
ySy8mcceTno,Surprised it didnt come out earlier
ySy8mcceTno,can i tell you      H0W LONG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A SLENDER MAN MOVIE? THE FIRST CLASSIC HORROR GAME. MY FAVORITE HORROR GAME. FROM THE START FINALLY HERE AS A MOVIE. **sniffs in happiness**
ySy8mcceTno,Are you serious? This is like 6 years late.. What a waste if money. This is like the Emoji Movie level of bad.
ySy8mcceTno,"If I see him, I will vroom vroom tf out of here."
ySy8mcceTno,"There you have it, Hollywood just ruined slender man."
ySy8mcceTno,I am
ySy8mcceTno,"Great, now we can have some more child murderers"
ySy8mcceTno,Who's watching this in 2019
ySy8mcceTno,"Imagine that...

Some human meake creepypasta of slenderman, then after so many years SONY make movie about that.

Just imagine how you would feel if sony do movie about you'r creepypasta lol"
ySy8mcceTno,LOL
ySy8mcceTno,10/10 can’t wait
ySy8mcceTno,To little to late to the meme
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow a Video game movie, this totally is going to be bad #Sarcasm"
ySy8mcceTno,First Five Knights at Freddy's (In production btw) and now this? What else is next?
ySy8mcceTno,Poor man’s babadook
ySy8mcceTno,"One page per movie, five bucks"
ySy8mcceTno,What this gonna do with finding notes though?
ySy8mcceTno,I'm glad they had the budget for all those booga booga effects
ySy8mcceTno,"While i think he was better as ""The Operator""... i am glad they are giving this creature a proper movie. y'know... not the same-old re-tread of the Blair Witch?"
ySy8mcceTno,Q asc
ySy8mcceTno,"please, don’t mess this franchise up as well."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender grey man
ySy8mcceTno,guys dont worry if we get into drop box the firewall will protect us from slender man (malware)
ySy8mcceTno,Gotta throw the whole movie studio away.
ySy8mcceTno,Was hoping this would look good but it looks like some bye bye man trash
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn’t even look scary.
ySy8mcceTno,wasn't there already a slenderman movie called always watching
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,Good meme
ySy8mcceTno,trailer looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,I hope to break 100k amazing subscribers mark this year which won’t be easy :/
ySy8mcceTno,READY FOR TRASH YA’LL
ySy8mcceTno,WDF dislike No 2621
ySy8mcceTno,#cabyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Hollywood... Always 7 years behind on trending topics; It almost feels like your grandad trying to fit in with todays youth by wearing a cap backwards and saggy pants with chains hanging out of them.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is so unnecessary
ySy8mcceTno,"You seriously chose to make a Slender Man movie and not a Five Days a Stranger movie? The rip-off gets the movie before the originator does, SMH."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is a lil late to the party
ySy8mcceTno,Good job Sony for a good trailer acho emojia movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m happy, but it’s a little late"
ySy8mcceTno,pretty much every slender game is scarier than this
ySy8mcceTno,WHAAAAAAAAAAT
ySy8mcceTno,Y’all would just put out this trailer around time when Logan Paul found the dead body.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the girl that was almost murdered because of this stupid story get a percentage of movie sales and anything that's connected to this.
ySy8mcceTno,Now make jeff the killer one >:3
ySy8mcceTno,"They really made a slender man movie what's next the ""human foot"" movie"
ySy8mcceTno,This is not scary bruh
ySy8mcceTno,So are we gonna get a Gangnam style movie next? Maybe a Harlem shake as well starring filthy frank? Or what about a god dam fidget spinner movie directed by peter Jackson or how about just the meme movie starring all our favorite outdated memes like harambe and pepe
ySy8mcceTno,OMG WHO IS HAPPY TO SEE SLENDER MAN AGAIN😊😊😊😊
ySy8mcceTno,First 2 minutes of slender man movie is slender man - slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os brrrr
ySy8mcceTno,My movie’s definitely going to be better.
ySy8mcceTno,A Slenderman movie that looks good???
ySy8mcceTno,"Remember when ""The slender man"" was just a blurred Photoshop of a stock image?

Pepperidge Farm remembers..."
ySy8mcceTno,WHY DOES SONY ENTERTAINMENT KEEP MAKING SUCH BAD CHOICES ?!?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,Plz change rateing to pg13 my parents wont let me se this awesom movie 😀💩💕
ySy8mcceTno,I think this movie is isn't gonna be as scary I think is gonna be more disturbing
ySy8mcceTno,Where's Markiplier when u need him
ySy8mcceTno,6 Years and still a good story
ySy8mcceTno,Wow. I can’t believe how awful this trailer looks.
ySy8mcceTno,*_-IS LOGAN PAUL THE MAIN CHARACTER?-_*
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,"Do the people who made this have an idea who Slender Man is besides a tall, skinny guy in the woods?"
ySy8mcceTno,Raw content ready to be mined for memeing
ySy8mcceTno,"Wtf
5 years too late"
ySy8mcceTno,remember Slender Man?: the movie
ySy8mcceTno,It's 2012 again!
ySy8mcceTno,We're gonna see less of slender man than we saw galactus in the F4 movie
ySy8mcceTno,It seems predictable anyways 😂
ySy8mcceTno,I remember being terrified of this when I was small. Now it’s just gonna ruin 2018 by being a bigger joke than the emoji movie. 😂 what a bad meme
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be trash I just know it...it's not needed.
ySy8mcceTno,I guess this is there make up for that marble hornets movie
ySy8mcceTno,JESUS CHRIST SONY DO YOU EVER LEARN??!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks stupid 😂
ySy8mcceTno,oh God
ySy8mcceTno,Every emos wet dream character on the big screen! Looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2011!
ySy8mcceTno,About a decade late there lol
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? Roblox the Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Ok...but did they have to
ySy8mcceTno,WTF no way
ySy8mcceTno,This is cringey as hell
ySy8mcceTno,WHY!
ySy8mcceTno,"SLENDER MAN, eres el amor de mi vida. :v <3 <3"
ySy8mcceTno,What was any of that? Was this made by the bad section of the team?
ySy8mcceTno,They better make fidget spinner movie
ySy8mcceTno,"What is this
This trailer shoes people going crazy and some kids that killed themself. #IsThisOurSlender"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm lowkey hyped for this!
ySy8mcceTno,The girls who attempted to kill their best friend as a sacrifice to slender man are *SHOOK* 👀😩
ySy8mcceTno,The cringing fan base is going too return with cancer
ySy8mcceTno,I think we've seen enough murdering in forests after logans video exposing someone who committed suicide
ySy8mcceTno,This movie would've been great in 2011...
ySy8mcceTno,"Yesssssss
Can’t wait till it comes out ❤️"
ySy8mcceTno,"Congrats sony, you're 6 years late to the hype"
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when I was younger and Slenderman and many others were my imaginary friends XD
ySy8mcceTno,Slender gang 😂
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks decent lol
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul laughing to this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Ohhhh holy crap
ySy8mcceTno,Why thi
ySy8mcceTno,*Takes a good possible horror franchise an makes it look like it should go straight to DVD.*
ySy8mcceTno,Is that the girl from Michael Myers
ySy8mcceTno,Ok Slender only appeared one time what
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh this was popular in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,DO I HAVE TO WAIT 8 YEARS FOR MY FNAF MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Like 6 years to late 😂 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Think you missed the hype with this one Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Thim him
ySy8mcceTno,Would have appreciated this trailer a lot more if they would have thrown him in the back round of more shots like ixk to where you don't notice him but then he's actually there psh just an idea oh and if the trailer would have came out in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,que trailer lixo. parece filme de qualquer outra coisa menos slanderman
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like a group of teenagers direct the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Only one shot of the actual slenderman =(
ySy8mcceTno,My balls
ySy8mcceTno,so it's a great time to do a movie about Kristaps Porzingis.... he is scary
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, I almost got thrown in prison...watch my video and see why..not click bait."
ySy8mcceTno,Why lol
ySy8mcceTno,What's next friken (insert scary movie name).exe or the FNAF HORROR MOVIE??!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought the slenderman craze was over 

It’s pretty boring and not scary at all nowadays unless you’re 8 years old"
ySy8mcceTno,"Dear Sony,

Stop with the blatent pandering. You failed last year, this will fail too. 

Please stop"
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda looks cheesy at the same time to me
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey guys, just a friendly reminder, don't forget that this is by the same people who thought the Emoji Movie was a good idea."
ySy8mcceTno,"Did you hear the father of one of the girls from the stabbing incident is trying to get attention by pretending the movie is based on their tragedy? Dude, it's not based on you, it's based on a fictional character that was created years before your children's' incident. It's not ""popularizing a tragedy"" it's a movie based on a fucking fictional character, learn that the world does not revolve around you."
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh look, more dead bodies for Logan to discover and make vlogs about"
ySy8mcceTno,👎
ySy8mcceTno,"What do you know, this video isn't age restricted."
ySy8mcceTno,Spoopyness intesifys*
ySy8mcceTno,Is it me or are there a.lot of woods realated things on trending right now
ySy8mcceTno,"100% chance that either Markiplier, jacksepticeye or pewdiepie make some sort of cameo in it"
ySy8mcceTno,But why tho
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,If there’s a dead body in the forest I might go film it and get tons of views
ySy8mcceTno,"Save your 12$ movie ticket and just go watch Marble Hornets. Twice as good and four times as scary as another shitty cookie cutter horror flick.
(not to mention that I can't believe this isn't considered a PR nightmare for Sony Pictures considering the actual murder that happened)"
ySy8mcceTno,When YouTube gets paid to put up videos on trending
ySy8mcceTno,Oh did they use the same music at the end from the original game??
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for this.
ySy8mcceTno,Eww
ySy8mcceTno,CRINGE : THE MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,Little to late don’t you think?
ySy8mcceTno,"They've alreasy made a Slender man movie about 3 or more years ago, I just hope this one is better."
ySy8mcceTno,"FAN:hey remember slenderman?
OTHER FAN:YEAH I DONT CARE DO YOU
FAN:YEAH I DONT LETS GO
SONY:SLENDERMANS BACK SAY WHAT YOU WANT I DONT CARE ITS NEVER LATE TO DO SOMETHING"
ySy8mcceTno,Their still making this? He's so 7 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm surprised they're making this after the two girls stabbed they're ""friend"""
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh ain't nobody care about Slender no more. Should've made it like 6 years ago...
ySy8mcceTno,Its stranger things season 2 but black and white
ySy8mcceTno,"This is like, six years too late. The while Slenderman thing has come and gone"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg need to see this looks so good love horror slender fave creepypasta character
ySy8mcceTno,Yo dis shiet looks spoicy
ySy8mcceTno,where's his suit :(
ySy8mcceTno,Can we talk about why Sony is the absolute worst?
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, Five Night's at Freddy?


oh no."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie about Slenderman I've been waiting for this for years
ySy8mcceTno,creepypasta movies now okay
ySy8mcceTno,Coming soon in twenty years and it won’t have any of this trailer. Ugh why show us this and take it away?!
ySy8mcceTno,Ya know. If they really wanted to make this movie. Don’t u think they would’ve made it back in like 2013 or 14
ySy8mcceTno,Where IS Will!?!?
ySy8mcceTno,They.......they actually made a movie......noice and also Slenderman things are obviously PG13 or R du
ySy8mcceTno,Here come the million slender indie games made with unity
ySy8mcceTno,A forest oh i guess put a logan paul face and it sells
ySy8mcceTno,"When there’s no room in Hell, Dead memes roam the earth once more"
ySy8mcceTno,This would be a comedy movie to Logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,".....OK then.
You got me interested."
ySy8mcceTno,And I'm still waiting for FNAF...
ySy8mcceTno,Too late
ySy8mcceTno,Probably gonna suck but I'm still watching tbh
ySy8mcceTno,five years too late???
ySy8mcceTno,Meh looks like a high budget fan made movie to me :/
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it comes out good. And not like a blare witch thing where you barley see him
ySy8mcceTno,who asked for this
ySy8mcceTno,"Who can take the sunfall?
(Who can take the sunfall?)
Sprinkle it with doom?
(Sprinkle it with doom?)
Cover it in blood
And a bone or two?
The Slenderman!
(The Slenderman!)
The Slenderman can!
(The Slenderman can!)


Oh boy, this film should be a fun time..."
ySy8mcceTno,No idea who Slender Man is but it looks like Phantasm meets Freddy Krueger meets The Fog with a bunch of high speed twitch jump scares. Color me unexcited.
ySy8mcceTno,Uhh no that's not how it goes at all. First of all the dude isn't naked he wears a suit and secondly he doesn't move he is a teleporting t pose moving character. Lastly where are the pages?!? (PS it's sarcasm)
ySy8mcceTno,What year is this again because I swear this is 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe this would have been relevant like 5 years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,Your 5 years late on the trend.
ySy8mcceTno,It looks okay. I know it's gonna suck but I still liked the vid
ySy8mcceTno,come on guys people are only gonna watch this to make fun of it
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the 3rd season of stranger things?? WOAH
ySy8mcceTno,"Someone: *sees slender man and screams*
Slender man: God dammit, I just wanted to give you your friend back but noooooo, you have to scream and make a big deal about it. Guess I have to kill you now."
ySy8mcceTno,By the trailer alone I can say it’s gonna focus more on the people and how they were affected by slender man and I predict it will have about 17 minutes of slender man showing up
ySy8mcceTno,What's up with the trends now like wtf?
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, at first I was excited because my childhood fear was becoming a horror movie. But after seeing the imagery and way it seems to be portrayed, I don't know how I feel about it. It seems like most of imagery was for shock value and it didn't feel centered around Slender Man. It felt like a slasher film. The writers should do more research on the lore and come back to it. Slender Man wasn't a slasher killer like Jeff the Killer, that's what made him scary. It's subtley shown the mental torture he puts his victims through, and I hope that's explored more in the movie. I'll still see the movie, but I'll definitely have my guard up."
ySy8mcceTno,Hell YESSS!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"deadass his name is basically skinny man, thin man, boney man, etc. why did i ever think that was spooky lmao"
ySy8mcceTno,you guys are like 6 years late with this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Hmmm.. this looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,This looks every bit as awful as I thought a slender man movie would be
ySy8mcceTno,THE RING RIP OFF!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like crap
ySy8mcceTno,Nice to see funny comments to make you not scared
ySy8mcceTno,Spoopy
ySy8mcceTno,CRINGE. Should've been made in 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,Bad timing with the sentences for the that court case being decided
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn’t look good, I like when it was just all about Marble Hornets."
ySy8mcceTno,"In the end I would rather there be a Slender Man movie than there not be a Slender Man movie. 

Better late than never. Lets see how it does. 👏🏻"
ySy8mcceTno,Hey look a movie I'm not gonna watch in cinema!

ySy8mcceTno,Strager things on crack
ySy8mcceTno,This new Venom trailer is lit!
ySy8mcceTno,He's my father
ySy8mcceTno,An hour and a half of somebody wandering around the forest looking for pages would make a great film
ySy8mcceTno,Please dont butcher this amazing franchise. Please
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf is it and worms in horror movies

ySy8mcceTno,Why Sony? 2012 died
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like it’s too a flop that happens the the mummy
ySy8mcceTno,Well the Marble Hornets movie turned out great... So...
ySy8mcceTno,Isn’t this a bit fucked after the whole stabbing incident
ySy8mcceTno,A few years late there
ySy8mcceTno,A few years late Johnny but c for effort
ySy8mcceTno,we all know its just logan paul playing as slendy
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see this I hope it be good
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch Marble Hornets.
ySy8mcceTno,The whole time I’m watching this I’m looking for the skip ad button
ySy8mcceTno,Finnaly a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this supposed to be creepy
ySy8mcceTno,It's gonna be good but no one is gonna watch it
ySy8mcceTno,um...why??

ySy8mcceTno,Jesus Christ it's 2018 people

ySy8mcceTno,MARKIPLIER GONNA LOVE THIS MOVIE.... AM I RIGHT??
ySy8mcceTno,Let the nostalgia commence!
ySy8mcceTno,*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*
ySy8mcceTno,"STOP WITH THE GODAMN BODIES IN FORESTS, ITS THE 3RD OF JAUNUARY"
ySy8mcceTno,I remember slender man back in 6th grade.... I’m a senior in high school now....
ySy8mcceTno,Why make a movie about slender man now? No one talked about him for like 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets is more impressive than this
ySy8mcceTno,That had to be one of the worst trailers I’ve ever seen. Wow.
ySy8mcceTno,Yuri's in this movie I guess.
ySy8mcceTno,"They should also make the Metroid movie, and Halo movie?!"
ySy8mcceTno,Cade os BR
ySy8mcceTno,So late but better late than never.  It did good so hopefully this does too
ySy8mcceTno,DRAGON BALL EVOLUTION VIBES
ySy8mcceTno,This is like stranger things on crack...
ySy8mcceTno,Have u traveled back in time to 2014?
ySy8mcceTno,And jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,This is so cool! Nar nee nar nar
ySy8mcceTno,They made a real slenderman movie!?
ySy8mcceTno,Omg! This is a movie they HAVE to get right.
ySy8mcceTno,"Feel like it would've been better of a plot if it was all in there heads, but not like all the teens just like three or two."
ySy8mcceTno,"Lemme guess they're gonna have a creepy pasta cinematic ""universe"""
ySy8mcceTno,Now they need to make a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is that like the thin man of the 50s ?
ySy8mcceTno,Whyyyy
ySy8mcceTno,And this based off the game how?
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul laughing 1:34
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,"I think it would be better if they made it to where Slender Man brings you into a nightmare where you are running from him in a Dark Mansion or Forest. And if you die in the nightmare you get the Slender sickness in your real body.
I mean think about most slender games out there have you play as a random person who has no idea where she's at or how she  got there. Kind of like a dream"
ySy8mcceTno,Too late.... Fifteen years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,When does it come out
ySy8mcceTno,So excited for this movie. But still terrified that a girl actually wanted to kill her so called best friend to be with him.
ySy8mcceTno,They better not mess this up or it’s going to be terrible.
ySy8mcceTno,"next stop,jeff the killer movie"
ySy8mcceTno,I walked in the woods and found a dead body
ySy8mcceTno,Slender mans been dead since 2012
ySy8mcceTno,So fucking late
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Thats not how slenderman operates. This movie will suck...
ySy8mcceTno,What a great thing to watch before I go to sleep!
ySy8mcceTno,To be honest the game more creepy than this trailer....
ySy8mcceTno,"I at least hope the guy who came up with slender-man got some royalties off this, whether it's good or not."
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you're too late for this movie should've made it earlier
ySy8mcceTno,"People who've played the game be like: THATS NOT ACCURATEEE
HE WAS ACTUALLY 6""8' FT TALL NOT 6""5.7 FT TALL
AND IF U REMEMBER FROM THE FIRST GAME THERE WERE 8 NOTES, NOT A BEDROOM FULL OF DRAWINGS
AND FURTHERMORE, HE HAD NO SCIENCE CLASS. THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS SCIENCE, IN HIS TIME."
ySy8mcceTno,The movie looks eh. Late if you ask me.
ySy8mcceTno,"WHY DID I THINK IT SAID ""SPIDER MAN""?"
ySy8mcceTno,Um BR esteve aqui =)
ySy8mcceTno,Mis oraciones se han dado sus frutos!!
ySy8mcceTno,No static???
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a good spider man movie I’m so excited
ySy8mcceTno,"Why is there one shot of the MAIN antagonist, is this a drama or a horror movie"
ySy8mcceTno,1:29  Me before a chemistry test.
ySy8mcceTno,Holy nugget
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man: WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?
Stranger Things: WHERE IS MY SON WILL?!
I swear that SlenderMan is the cousin of the demigordon"
ySy8mcceTno,looks like a terrible plot.
ySy8mcceTno,I like slenderman so why is everyone hating on this
ySy8mcceTno,"*Wow,Entonces Para Cuando La pelicula de* *Jeff The killer*"
ySy8mcceTno,Only took em like 5 years
ySy8mcceTno,Sony Slender Man isn't popular anymore how out of touch are you?!!
ySy8mcceTno,K but why
ySy8mcceTno,I hope it's good!!!
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no Slender Man's attacking with his stock footage
ySy8mcceTno,Dafaq??slendy?
ySy8mcceTno,why do i feel like this is going to be a meme
ySy8mcceTno,Ooky spooky
ySy8mcceTno,*Gay Elephant Noise*
ySy8mcceTno,Please Sony stop
ySy8mcceTno,This is appropriate timing since it just turned 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for real?
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer next?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman 
Slenderman  
Dressed in black suit and black tie 
You
Most 
Certainly 
Will
Die"
ySy8mcceTno,oh jesus
ySy8mcceTno,"Not what i expected, but im digging the indie vibe, looks terrifying"
ySy8mcceTno,this is like 6 years late but ok
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing that is higher on trending is that shitty Logan Paul apology lol
ySy8mcceTno,I wanted to genuinely believe before starting the trailer that the movie would have a chance.  Then I saw that Sony was producing...
ySy8mcceTno,"If a creepypasta can be a movie, we may as well make every fanfiction into a movie.

ESPECIALLY THE UNDERTALE ONES"
ySy8mcceTno,Who’s here before 1M
ySy8mcceTno,Just 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,When Logan Paul’s #1 trending this is nothing hahah
ySy8mcceTno,I'm surprised they made a movie after the stabbing incident.
ySy8mcceTno,And we all thought IT was scary
ySy8mcceTno,Do they still have to collect all the pages in order to defeat Slender Man?
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao this looks terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"So fucking generic, you can replace him with any other monster and the concept will still be the same thing"
ySy8mcceTno,"Stay away 2012, No one wants you"
ySy8mcceTno,Stock up on batteries and spare flashlights!
ySy8mcceTno,wow what
ySy8mcceTno,"Wellll, this is a bit late no?"
ySy8mcceTno,old meme lol
ySy8mcceTno,You know I always figured that the slender man movies were crap but this one looks ok...for now.
ySy8mcceTno,What's next a 12 year old who cut his face to resemble a smile and kills his family along with many others? Pffffft
ySy8mcceTno,ok 1-When is it coming out and 2-Please doen't $#*@ it
ySy8mcceTno,Finally!!!
ySy8mcceTno,THROWBACK
ySy8mcceTno,SHOOK
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't y'all think this is... I don't know, a half a decade late"
ySy8mcceTno,"Coming out, my birthday"
ySy8mcceTno,"This is no slender man movie, nothing in this trailer was slender related accept for the one part where they show him #notmyslenderman"
ySy8mcceTno,"What the hell was that? They tried doing this in 2014 and 2015, I thought they'd given up."
ySy8mcceTno,"Can’t wait to see 12 year olds and creepypasta weebs crowding the AMC theatre while me and the homeboys tryna see Infinity War, but then again, I need a second trailer because this trailer was confusing."
ySy8mcceTno,They start making the movie when the games irrelevant?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,Such a garbage trailer.  Get ready for one of the biggest flops in 2018.
ySy8mcceTno,OMG YESSS
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is pretty late
ySy8mcceTno,This is like the emoji movie.... they think it’s gonna be cool and a bop but its actually a FLOP
ySy8mcceTno,this will be bad movie
ySy8mcceTno,"To think, this all started because of a Photoshop contest"
ySy8mcceTno,Yes a slender man mobie
ySy8mcceTno,"Bad Movie, Good Game"
ySy8mcceTno,where is slenderman's suit and tie?? 0 out of 10. will not watch XD
ySy8mcceTno,I have been waiting 5 years for this to happen. And it appears my prayers have been answered.
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer lacks in parts, but it's interesting for the most part, at least to me. I'm hoping it does well."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, so they went this far."
ySy8mcceTno,About 6 years late guys
ySy8mcceTno,"this movie would've been good....
IN FUCKING 2010"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s so late tho
ySy8mcceTno,does it have to be sony? I am exited
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer wasn't very convincing...
ySy8mcceTno,This is like one big scary how do you do fello millennials
ySy8mcceTno,A few years late
ySy8mcceTno,Imma watch when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is about to have a backstory and be killed by love. He’s also going to be a she to not anger the feminists.
ySy8mcceTno,A Slender Man movie trailer and Slender Man is in it for less than 3 seconds.
ySy8mcceTno,They really should've kept the Toys R Us references. That's what made the screenplay work in the first place
ySy8mcceTno,Welp call up Wilford warfstache
ySy8mcceTno,"This would've been cool back in 2012, but I guess better late than never?....."
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman was a Photoshop contest that became a video game.
ySy8mcceTno,"You realize the entire point of this movie is kinda dumb, right? Like if they follow the lore and rules of Slenderman, all the characters that have seen him will have to die right? So there is kinda no point in seeing the movie when you know what will happen to the main characters who have conflict with him."
ySy8mcceTno,Sanic The Hedehog Getter goe Fest. In July 24 2018 in theaters near you.
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh good, let's see how many little girls kill their friends after this! 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,"Just saw the whole movie through this trailer. 4.3/10 

No character development"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man was made years and years ago and now you make a movie about it?
ySy8mcceTno,Me ready for movie
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good
ySy8mcceTno,It's a fact to slender Man ain't real
ySy8mcceTno,Oh I thought a slender man movie existed already :p
ySy8mcceTno,Happy to see a trailer that is more like a teaser. Don't give me the plot. I know what Slender Man is. Does it look good? Yep. Does it sound good? The Game of Thrones composer is doing the score. This is actually underselling the movie. I am in. #teamslenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Nope, just nope"
ySy8mcceTno,for what pvrpose
ySy8mcceTno,Who knew some shitty game would become a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Hollywood has officially ran out of movie ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie better not be crap
ySy8mcceTno,I sense a lack of gay elephants
ySy8mcceTno,Why...
ySy8mcceTno,Going to be a clusterfuck of scary noises and stock footage.
ySy8mcceTno,Any way we can put some gangum style in this?
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman confirmed as next Dead By Daylight killer
ySy8mcceTno,"Bruh, I thought creepypasta died 5 years ago"
ySy8mcceTno,https://caradvertizing.clickfunnels.com/optaxbuuyhq?affiliate_id=912348
ySy8mcceTno,"The emoji movie, a horror film"
ySy8mcceTno,I actually thought it was fan made because of the creepy pasta thing from copule years back but when I saw the trending thing I immediately found this stupid
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for slenderbone to come out next ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah too late
ySy8mcceTno,Grove Street. Home. At least it was before I fucked everything up.
ySy8mcceTno,"Few years late, chief."
ySy8mcceTno,This would’ve been interesting in 2012 when this was a thing
ySy8mcceTno,Take a hint from Resident Evil. Games and movies don’t go together.
ySy8mcceTno,‘Bout 9 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Ahora si viene lo chido :D
ySy8mcceTno,"I legit read the thumbnail as ""SPIDER MAN"""
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t stand out from all the other “horror” garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be a let down you already know it
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god
ySy8mcceTno,2k18 is going great so far
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait, I thought it was the beginning of 2018 not 2011"
ySy8mcceTno,Id rathed watch golf than this
ySy8mcceTno,You can definetly feel the totheark vibes in the trailer
ySy8mcceTno,MY BOI FINALLY GETS HIS OWN MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is going to be great yes with all the unnecessary dialog with millasecond appearance with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Dumb
ySy8mcceTno,"Esta mierda ¿Que tiene que ver con Slenderman?, De por si que Slenderman paso de moda en 2012 :V"
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell this will be a disappointment
ySy8mcceTno,"Is this a thing now??? Every production company makes their own version??? MARBLE HORNETS ALREADY DID THIS WHAT ARE YOU DOOOING 

You're tearing me apart lisa..."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like this is based more on the “slender man” news story than the original creepypasta. It’s an interesting take... it still might be based on the creepypasta though.
ySy8mcceTno,Esta parte era mejor en el manga :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Espero que sea real, pendejos :)"
ySy8mcceTno,A dead meme made into a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is too late slender guy used to be a trend back in the early 2000s
ySy8mcceTno,"It didn't look real good until the end, still my give it a try"
ySy8mcceTno,Very progressive to have a gay elephant involved in the sound production!
ySy8mcceTno,"It all started as a little thing we talked about as kids, now it’s a freaking movie"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG TANKS TANKS YEEEESSSSS! !!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,i want too se it but its most likely gonna be rated r
ySy8mcceTno,I can already tell that this movie is going to be boring and confusing.
ySy8mcceTno,I already saw another movie about slender man they were 2
ySy8mcceTno,Wow they ran out of ideas.🤔🤔
ySy8mcceTno,"I️ have to say, slight stranger things type of feel..... smh"
ySy8mcceTno,*6 yEaRs LaTeR*
ySy8mcceTno,Steamy hot garbage. Hot hot garbage.
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Wait slender man was still a thing?
ySy8mcceTno,Who else saw the woods and thought logan Paul
ySy8mcceTno,please don’t suck please don’t suck please don’t suck please don’t-
ySy8mcceTno,TBH this don't look to good
ySy8mcceTno,Next up.....FIDGET SPINNER - Official Trailer 1 (HD)
ySy8mcceTno,Bruuutaaalll
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no
ySy8mcceTno,Bet 5 bucks that mainly only 12 years are going to see this
ySy8mcceTno,"First of all, this is like 5 years too late, and that't being generous. Second, this doesn't look like it has anything to do with the Slenderman character. It just seems like a generic psychological horror. I would have been interested to see a movie that explores exactly what the Slenderman is. Or maybe an adaptation of the story from ""Slender: The Arrival."""
ySy8mcceTno,bruh they copied off of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,THE TOP THREE TRENDING VIDEOS ARE ABOUT THE WOODS I'M
ySy8mcceTno,Looks great 👌🏻
ySy8mcceTno,What's next The Emoji Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry, i dont like this story"
ySy8mcceTno,7 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,You're like 6 years late lmao
ySy8mcceTno,AThis FUCKING SUCKS
ySy8mcceTno,Lame asf
ySy8mcceTno,Seriously?
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman's still relevant, right guys?






... guys?"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hollywood: OMG ALL THE KIDS ARE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS NEW THING CALLED SPLENDA MAN WE SHOULD TOTALLY MAKE DA SCARY MOVIE ABOUT IT!
Some random dude: uh, that was a fad from years ago, and also I think it's Slen-
Hollywood: GET THE SUGAR AND FAKE BLOOD WE'RE DOING THIS THING!"
ySy8mcceTno,I’d rather have a horror movie about that vine where big bird kicks down a door.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh wait when its the ending of slender men ticci Toby appears at a forest looking back accurately and tilts his head and bam it ends like that with a black screen
ySy8mcceTno,What's next a Jeff the killer movie?
ySy8mcceTno,How much you want to bet that you will barely see slender man?
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to watch it just to laugh at it's cheezyness and stupidness.
ySy8mcceTno,si alguien entiende esto quiero que sepa que  la peli pinta a que va a hacer buena pero le falta mucho y que cuando llegue a latinoamerica vamos a llenar las salas de cine
ySy8mcceTno,@miniminter
ySy8mcceTno,"Cool, But Where's My VENOM Movie ?!?!?"
ySy8mcceTno,O Love slenderman i Want that the movie will be good

ySy8mcceTno,Would have been cool in 2011
ySy8mcceTno,I can smell the memes from a mile away.
ySy8mcceTno,Did I just teleport to 2012?
ySy8mcceTno,"If you want good slender man content, watch the YouTube channel Marble Hornets instead"
ySy8mcceTno,A disappointment to the creepypasta community
ySy8mcceTno,1:26 good job...
ySy8mcceTno,U guys are really late on creepy pasta but I have always loved creepy pasta so at the same time I'm glad they made it because atleast some people will know about creepy pasta
ySy8mcceTno,Shouldn’t they have made this movie in about 2014 or 2013
ySy8mcceTno,"This summer the most terrifying internet phenomena now has his movie, Pepe the feature film."
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow 
seriously wow"
ySy8mcceTno,Can’t wait for this flop
ySy8mcceTno,"2018 so far:

-Trump does stupid stuff 
-Logan Paul goes to the suicide forest, finds a dead body and laughs about it like it’s a sick joke
And now slender man is a MOVIE????
Actually kill me"
ySy8mcceTno,Ticci Toby pls a movie its gonna make people blow there minds off you will make alot of money just pls its gonna be a great movie
ySy8mcceTno,DUDE!! DUDE!! DUDE!! or MATE!! MATE!! MATE!!!

ySy8mcceTno,The spiritual successor to the bye-bye man. You heard it first
ySy8mcceTno,Yes.
ySy8mcceTno,Why did they just start making a movie about this
ySy8mcceTno,The New X Files movie looks great...
ySy8mcceTno,if they do this movie right wich i bet they wont pennywise could finally have a rival
ySy8mcceTno,Do they know how old this is?
ySy8mcceTno,FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,you better make it rated R
ySy8mcceTno,They should’ve made this when he was actually scary like 2012-2013 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real please tell me this has to be fan made like come on the slender man trend ended long long ago so this has to be fan made or fake if not then oh well so much for my dream of making a video game of it and bring back the trend in a more brighter a modern-day approach like in horror games instead of this approach but I hope at least the movie is decent So I’m coming in with low expectations for now will see.
ySy8mcceTno,"oh coo-
""Sony Pictures""
ahhh"
ySy8mcceTno,What year is it
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Running out of ideas?
ySy8mcceTno,The ring 4
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer should've ended after 1:51
ySy8mcceTno,Ticci toby
ySy8mcceTno,Barely even showed slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be so bad
ySy8mcceTno,Why are movie studios makin movies based off of internet ghost stories from 2009?

ySy8mcceTno,It’s gonna suck probably most game movie aren’t good
ySy8mcceTno,Gucci toby
ySy8mcceTno,I had enough with the woods after Logan Paul. And the first top 4 trending videos are all about the woods.
ySy8mcceTno,"I love how half the comments are like
""Oh my god, I love Slenderman! Can't wait to see this :D""
and the other half are like
""WTF dead game this is gonna flop. Worse than the Emoji Movie"""
ySy8mcceTno,Soooo ooohhh where's the scary part?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks weak
ySy8mcceTno,#NotMySlender
ySy8mcceTno,Do ticci toby
ySy8mcceTno,We are now scrapping the bottom of the barrel.
ySy8mcceTno,Wait till the uncut version come out on home video. So we can see the scene with the gay elephant.
ySy8mcceTno,I hope this move is not trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Only 6 years late, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Well the 2013 girls better be watching this movie to 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,The only thing that can defeat slender man is thicc woman.
ySy8mcceTno,Only the end of the the trailer looks like a slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is five years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Based in real facts
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna suuuuuuck. Especially since Hollywood has no idea how to make horror movies anymore
ySy8mcceTno,You hardly seen slender man in the entire trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,took you this long?
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was over
ySy8mcceTno,Way to strike when the iron is hot
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer looks like a heavy metal music video
ySy8mcceTno,"This would have been exciting, if this was 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,Shared Universe with Ghostbusters? *obvious troll post*
ySy8mcceTno,"XD Slenderman is so old, Sony your late B"
ySy8mcceTno,"Im guessing its going to be good, but in the end unimpreshionable, kind of like how the new jumanji is. Its good, but you probably wont remember it like the original jumanji"
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/V7gOpNLG5HE
ySy8mcceTno,Seriously!? Lmao 😂
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like the game is too old now. This would have been great maybe like 5 years ago.
ySy8mcceTno,"is this the ring trailer?
no! ok"
ySy8mcceTno,Wouldn’t it be so much cooler if this movie was a horror comedy instead of a straight up horror? Then maybe they’d have to put effort into the script
ySy8mcceTno,Looks garbage..
ySy8mcceTno,Well this looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,IS COMING!!! CreepyPasta Cinematic Universe 😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,que sigue jeft the killer :v
ySy8mcceTno,Please have iDubbbz make a cameo with Slenderman Gangnam Style.
ySy8mcceTno,Let's hope this is better than the Marble Hornets movie!
ySy8mcceTno,"About fucking time, took y'all long enough!"
ySy8mcceTno,can’t wait for the fanf movie..
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else see trailers like this and just think it's fake? Like why make movies when it's clearly a dead meme?
ySy8mcceTno,What's next the smile dog movie
ySy8mcceTno,Gaaaaaaaaaaayyyy
ySy8mcceTno,"El trailer no tiene forma, no se ve nada de historia, solo imagenes al azar, no llama la atención, no se siente la atmósfera que tienen los juegos.... pésimo manejo de un gran personaje."
ySy8mcceTno,Dang only 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Made the movie 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,So they are turning memes into movies now?
ySy8mcceTno,1:43 Slender Man: Congratulations.....you played yourself
ySy8mcceTno,I expect to see pewdiepie.
ySy8mcceTno,Spooky
ySy8mcceTno,Wow it took Hollywood that long to make a movie of this?
ySy8mcceTno,:43 it looks like there is a drawing of the shadow monster
ySy8mcceTno,My expectations are extremely low
ySy8mcceTno,I’m actually so excited for this
ySy8mcceTno,"Spoiler alert! 






Slender Man is only shown for 5 minutes in this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Is someone gonna tell them this died a while ago or should???
ySy8mcceTno,now we need an SCP containment breach movie
ySy8mcceTno,Omg yasss
ySy8mcceTno,Dis don't make sense
ySy8mcceTno,You're about four years late on this one
ySy8mcceTno,A horrible horror movie to start off the year 2018.
ySy8mcceTno,Don't worry Sony you'll get ideas some day
ySy8mcceTno,"5 years too late, sony"
ySy8mcceTno,Great. What’s next Five nights at Freddy’s?
ySy8mcceTno,0:27 “people just don’t disappear” i think this is gonna be a bad version of stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,I can see Logan Paul Forest of Fear coming in 6 years now!
ySy8mcceTno,No way
ySy8mcceTno,Little late aren't you? This fad died out about 2012 or 2013.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow is it 2013 already?
ySy8mcceTno,"Thats the thing about a lot of scary movies. They try to scare bu trying to be ""aesthetic"" yah like adding crazy people, jump scares and changing the color tone of the videos to look ""darker"" can make one feel kinda scared ig, but really it's in the plot. It's not going to be scary if you know for a fact that it's fake. If you make the plot more realistic and relevant to real life then yah that'd be more scary. Kinda like ""based on a true story"" kinda deal but not over used. Ya feel?"
ySy8mcceTno,"majority of the trailor has nothing to do with Slenderman, just random horror crap"
ySy8mcceTno,Pass.
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"So is he like, a disease now?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Meh
ySy8mcceTno,8 years late to the punch.
ySy8mcceTno,"In all honesty I’m surprised it took them so long. However, I’d much rather see a SCP containment breach movie."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks stupid
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 Yuri?
ySy8mcceTno,I've been waiting waiting so long for this
ySy8mcceTno,My friends didn’t believe when I said it was coming out 😭😭😭
ySy8mcceTno,A Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,"This could be good 





If it was 2011"
ySy8mcceTno,"Of course there's a weird little girl with long messy hair doing something ""creepy"" it's getting old."
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I want to see this if I'm not a fan of horror movies?
ySy8mcceTno,THE MEME WENT TOO FAR
ySy8mcceTno,L
ySy8mcceTno,"Didn't see this coming, WOW"
ySy8mcceTno,"Escuchas eso? Es otro mojón de película acercándose leeeeento, lista para atacar alos fans de la saga y ala gente con buen gusto de películas"
ySy8mcceTno,Another Emoji movie I know it
ySy8mcceTno,guys did you hear the gay elephant noise at 1:32
ySy8mcceTno,well i hope that guy at something awful is getting royalties. But wow this looks scary and with the stabbing case in Wisconsin makes even more interesting
ySy8mcceTno,"Yes, go into the woods at night"
ySy8mcceTno,"So we got an apology video at number one on trending from filming a dead guy in the woods, then at number two, we have a upcoming movie about a creature in the woods, and at number three, a music video titled “Man of the Woods”."
ySy8mcceTno,still won't be as good as Marble Hornets or Tribe Twelve
ySy8mcceTno,But...but where's the classic slender man death sound
ySy8mcceTno,Vaya mierda
ySy8mcceTno,At this rate we'll get the FNAF movie in 2028
ySy8mcceTno,n i b b a
ySy8mcceTno,"Why does it have to be Massachusetts? 
I live here in Boston,Massachusetts 😭
But thats cool that they made a movie about slenderman didn't expect it"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should of been made years ago..... Its not scary anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,Wait why tf would you stab yourself in the head of all places lol
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder if Undoomed knows they made his origin story.
ySy8mcceTno,*Made for a photoshop contest. Became a terrifying monster*
ySy8mcceTno,I have lost all faith in humanity
ySy8mcceTno,"No, just no. Fnaf movie, fine. But a slender movie, no"
ySy8mcceTno,Whats next? Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, I think you are a little late to this; by like 4 years.




Also where the hell is the emoji movie 2 !!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,I can't say I'm really surprised that they turned this into a movie. I was just wondering when?
ySy8mcceTno,Finally they made a movie
ySy8mcceTno,This movie reeks of teen angst.
ySy8mcceTno,"hey
this idea?
bad
another idea:
The Endless House.
now that's horror with plot."
ySy8mcceTno,I want a Jeff the killer movie
ySy8mcceTno,10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Noooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets was scarier tbh. This is predictable. As most of horror movies are. Boring.
ySy8mcceTno,"Oof, just a few years too late there, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,*OMG*
ySy8mcceTno,"Marker + Glass = Sounds like it's on paper.
10/10 audio."
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn't look that good.
ySy8mcceTno,Will they include the scene where a girl gets murdered by her 2 best friends?
ySy8mcceTno,"i feel like they should've made the movie's story like ""slender arrival"" with the whole trying to kill the thing. & how many people do you think are going to watch this and go out to do something stupid and say ""slender told me to?"""
ySy8mcceTno,Welp...They finally did it.
ySy8mcceTno,Would be bettet if it were inspired by Marble Hornets. Not like orginal Marble Hornets movie
ySy8mcceTno,I love marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,this looks wack asf  the game is better I already k it
ySy8mcceTno,No lo sé Rick parece falso
ySy8mcceTno,Are they adding the thing about those two girls who kill they’re friend and said slender man made them do it?  This looks like a good concept but I’m worried it’s going to be garbage
ySy8mcceTno,LAME
ySy8mcceTno,this movie may have been exciting in 2010 when its target audience was still in fucking middle school
ySy8mcceTno,"Another stupid history of american teens 2
(death note of Netflix is the first part)"
ySy8mcceTno,I might only watch this because I am honestly curious about the slender man. Is it an alien? Or is it some weird mutated scientist?
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man died like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"They actually made this into a movie, next thing we know there's gonna be a Jeff The Killer movie"
ySy8mcceTno,It’s a no from me
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, am I supposed to be invested in the story or something? I can see how it could be good, but I can see how it could also be bad from this trailer. Leaning more on the bad from what this trailer did. It just seems like a surreal film more than anything, but a surreal film with an outline of a story. Surrealism only works well if it's vague only to explain something at the end, but a lot of people know what Slender Man does already. I like the idea and all, but not only is this a little late, but the trailer just doesn't get me all that excited. Now changing up the Slender Man thing in the movie could work well, but also fall apart. The only way I see this as effective or worthwhile is through change, but that change could also potentially make it worse. Then there's the characters, are they going to be hollow and pathetic bait for Slender Man, or are we actually going to be able to invest into their characters? Hollow shells, I can respect if it's going in a surreal direction. In some ways I could say the same about well developed characters, but that would take a lot of creativity to work well in a surreal film. I'm not sure how this movie will be though, I'm just guessing it'll be usual current Sony. Bad, meh, or alright, it could be really good if cards are played well."
ySy8mcceTno,You gotta be shitting me
ySy8mcceTno,This came 2-3 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Wonder in how many years the FNAF movie will be teased. I give it 4 years
ySy8mcceTno,Hello? What year is this?
ySy8mcceTno,6 slender movies later finally a good one? Is the scalpel scene a reference to Eyeless Jack?
ySy8mcceTno,I wanna bet a million dollars that this is gonna be another disappointing horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,if only Heath ledger was alive there could have been a clock work orange remake
ySy8mcceTno,Oh great! A nother movie that shows the evil thing like what?.... twice???
ySy8mcceTno,So Hollywood finally ran out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it said spider man
ySy8mcceTno,Please sign the petition to restore this movie to it's original title which is: Concrete Girrafes. I also hope they didn't get rid of the scene with Jonathan the Gay Elephant.
ySy8mcceTno,And you thought it couldn't get worse than The Emoji Movie.
ySy8mcceTno,SO PUMPED THOUGH I KNOW ITS GOING TO BE SUPER TRASHY
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks just like the ring! 👊
ySy8mcceTno,spooky
ySy8mcceTno,When you arrive to the party and everyone's already left
ySy8mcceTno,"WTF. I remember watching so many fake trailers for slender man around 5 years ago. Too bad there’s no hype for it anymore, it’s kinda old now."
ySy8mcceTno,I'm kinda having doubts...😕
ySy8mcceTno,"This is going to be another ""the forest"" movie... This shouldn't be a movie"
ySy8mcceTno,A meme from 2012 will be an a c t u a l f i l m
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty good can't wait to see it!
ySy8mcceTno,OH SO THEY MADE A SLENDERMAN MOVIE BUT WHERES THE FNAF ONE HUH???
ySy8mcceTno,I KNEW this would be in trending!
ySy8mcceTno,They're almost a decade late...
ySy8mcceTno,i want it. but i have bad feelings.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is really trying anything
ySy8mcceTno,They should have made this movie when slender man was still a thing (popular)  but nope they had to wait 9 years
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to suck..... I can feel it
ySy8mcceTno,Girl gets possesed. Haven't seen that before.
ySy8mcceTno,"Alv, esto es como volver al 2010"
ySy8mcceTno,wot? This is confusing
ySy8mcceTno,Lame
ySy8mcceTno,If Pewdiepie isn’t in this movie im gonna be triggered
ySy8mcceTno,I want this to be good I really do but we'll see
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man the movie featuring emojis.
ySy8mcceTno,Let the game diE
ySy8mcceTno,Well this was very distasteful of Sony. Slender Man has caused problems and now a movie comes from it. Shame on you Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,I can hear the CinemaSins counter skyrocketing through the roof already.
ySy8mcceTno,don't have much to go on..but have a bad feeling about this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Why...can I know WHY?
ySy8mcceTno,It looks like a nightmare on elm street rip off
ySy8mcceTno,"First it was the emoji movie, now this wtf"
ySy8mcceTno,Coming April 1 2014
ySy8mcceTno,Yeet
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated movie of 2009!
ySy8mcceTno,Next up is five nights at freddy's movie in 2020

ySy8mcceTno,This looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,yikes
ySy8mcceTno,Yes so good
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, hope you know what your doing"
ySy8mcceTno,We already have two memed trash turned into movies. The emoji movie now this. Oh god
ySy8mcceTno,Why do scary movies have to be so gory and sickening these days. These days there’s hardly any good old fashioned horror films.
ySy8mcceTno,S U C C

ySy8mcceTno,I can tell this movie is going to suck
ySy8mcceTno,"I’m actually ok with this movie. I know it’s late and all, but it’s a horror movie. Who doesn’t like a good scare?"
ySy8mcceTno,What a vague trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,I'm holding hope this is good
ySy8mcceTno,Great movie in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks like a generic awful jumpscare fest. Wheres north korea when u need them..

ySy8mcceTno,What have we come to
ySy8mcceTno,When has a game ever been a good movie?
ySy8mcceTno,At age 6 I was born without a face.
ySy8mcceTno,I think this movie is gonna have a bad ending  🙄🙄
ySy8mcceTno,it's honestly a fucking miracle this isn't a found footage type movie
ySy8mcceTno,Five years late bud
ySy8mcceTno,So did you paid the man for the rights to make a movie hoe
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like the movie industry is running out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,If they we're gonna do this they should've had Steven Spielberg Direct it. The man is a genius with these type of movies
ySy8mcceTno,you guys are six years later. slenderman isn't a thing anymore
ySy8mcceTno,I smell Sony Product placement
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho ?
ySy8mcceTno,"I really want for this to be good, but that trailer made it look like cookie-cutter garbage"
ySy8mcceTno,"This was relevant in 2012, it is no longer relevant."
ySy8mcceTno,hopefully it isn't as bad as the marble hornets movie
ySy8mcceTno,"The tagline for the movie should be: Slender man, he eats his vegetables."
ySy8mcceTno,C Pillin
ySy8mcceTno,Wasn't there already supposed to be a slender man movie out a few years ago? Like 2013 or something?
ySy8mcceTno,It was about time??

ySy8mcceTno,A movie based off a video game based off an urban legend....simply epci
ySy8mcceTno,hope they lose all their money on this. I'd be so happy if it wins worst film of 2018.
ySy8mcceTno,"We all wanted this, but sadly this is a few years too late."
ySy8mcceTno,T-T-T-TRASH!
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry to nit pick but he doesn't look like slender man, he just looks as if someone slapped him with spaghetti sauce and said ""Presto! Ya done!"". If you are going to do a movie based on something pre-existing at least get the character right. Although I'm uncertain the reason why he looks this way, hopefully it's due to something later on and he doesn't look like this for the rest of the film."
ySy8mcceTno,I am looking forward to seeing this
ySy8mcceTno,Yawn
ySy8mcceTno,They girl that got stabbed because of her friends sacrificing her to slenderman better have a cameo. :/

That was something"
ySy8mcceTno,No. Please no...
ySy8mcceTno,It's HAPPENING

ySy8mcceTno,"Oh man, i cant wait 'till the new emo memes start popping up!"
ySy8mcceTno,This better have Pewdiepie screaming at the jump scares
ySy8mcceTno,Can this movie get any scarier?
ySy8mcceTno,"Just...
Meh..."
ySy8mcceTno,Dude this film is gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks trash. Would rather have it just be about slender anyways, not edgy suicidal teenage girls."
ySy8mcceTno,What a way to f up a movie in 2018
ySy8mcceTno,today is a sad day for all the people of earth.
ySy8mcceTno,Yikes
ySy8mcceTno,I heard they were making a rage comics movie next.
ySy8mcceTno,So is this a remastered stranger things 1 or is it 3?
ySy8mcceTno,slender m8
ySy8mcceTno,Omg 🤦‍♂️ the trailer was so bad and took away everything unique about slender man and the experience and made him every generic horror movie monster ever lol😂😂😂 this looks like it is had no heart put into it ♥️ this is probably gonna be the next Dragonball Evolution
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this was coming since day one no joke
ySy8mcceTno,"Conan: The Slender Man! It's an old folktale, the Slender Man!

ySy8mcceTno,"This is gonna be good. This is gonna be good. This is gonna be good. This is gonna be---
1:50
God damnit.
Ok, so... here's a little lesson on Slenderman. (one word, by the way)
He's unique in the sense that you never really see him all that well. you even acknowledged this. Slender man gets to you by looking like a tree and capturing you unexpectedly. you don't SEE slenderman, so why would he jumpscare you in front of your face?
This is something the games got wrong too, so i'll cut you some slack."
ySy8mcceTno,Ugh just stick to the games
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks like there is lots of suicide in this movie, I guess suicide is popular in 2018 (Logan Paul)"
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh, God help us... hollywood is running out of ideas?!"
ySy8mcceTno,Jumpscare the movie part whatever.
ySy8mcceTno,remeber this ladys and gents Sony is the ones who created the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Is this real??? Please no....a other bad video game movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"The writer and director have a very.. interesting career. Most of their movies I never heard of and most of ‘em didn’t get the best reviews. I am excited to see how’ll the movie turn out even if it doesn’t look like it has the best direction as you can’t really judge the trailer for the movie, everyone did that to JW and look at what happened with that."

ySy8mcceTno,The book is better
ySy8mcceTno,After that jumpscare bicth I'm out
ySy8mcceTno,"Is it just me, or does this look like a weird rip off of the ring that's about 12 years too late?"
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer wasn’t even good now imagine the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Too late Sony. Too late.
ySy8mcceTno,"You're a few years too late, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,Who asked for this

ySy8mcceTno,Dafuq
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh boy, another video game movie, bet this will be a greeeaaattt movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Appears more a alien figure than a tall slim tuxedo man.
ySy8mcceTno,"Enderman, an unofficial minecraft sotry"
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh
ySy8mcceTno,I hope Logan Paul in it
ySy8mcceTno,Just shoot him in the head LOL
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly S.C.P would have been a better pick for a garbage movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not much of a movie critic, but this looks really bad"
ySy8mcceTno,Sucide is badass
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Bro after my friends said he was real I believed in him but I grew out of it noe they have to make a movie out of it dammit
ySy8mcceTno,Doki Doki Literature Club movie when?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks good to be honest. Looks like a horror movie that builds on atmosphere and not cheap scares
ySy8mcceTno,Even though this is year late it does look mildly interesting
ySy8mcceTno,"This is going to be one of those movies.i can already tell, humanity is already gone down this route. Looks like we are going down this one again."
ySy8mcceTno,I am so excited 😄😄😄
ySy8mcceTno,You’re a little late to the slender party
ySy8mcceTno,Is it the demogorgon?
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty good hope o doesn't turn out bad
ySy8mcceTno,Sell your selfs to Disney already!!!!!!

ySy8mcceTno,Why does the audio cut out at 1:33
ySy8mcceTno,Spooky scary skeletons
ySy8mcceTno,I’m curious but I feel this will still be mediocre
ySy8mcceTno,"What's next, Sonic.exe?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man died like 6 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,Ironic number 1 trending is apologizing about filming a poor dead guy in the woods and that number 3 trending is about...death in the woods. Good timing YouTube. Plus number 2 trending is man in the woods. Jesus Christ
ySy8mcceTno,"Пойду только потому,что это Слендер"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo sigo esperando la película de JEFF  :v
ySy8mcceTno,Is Slenderman still relevant nowadays?
ySy8mcceTno,"Nobody thought this would happen, but it is"
ySy8mcceTno,Yay! A phenomenon made real.
ySy8mcceTno,this might be real terrible actually
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s the iconic camera perspective and it fizzling
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,OMG nice movie
ySy8mcceTno,How to beat Slender Man. Just be blind.
ySy8mcceTno,I have hemorrhoids
ySy8mcceTno,Alright a slender movie. Too bad they made it look like every horror film out there.
ySy8mcceTno,But is real?
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this is going to be about the 2014 incident when 2 girls stabbed their friend 19 times, and she survived, and the surgeries she gone through, and the hunt for the 2 girls"
ySy8mcceTno,Gaming culture is truly taking over✊🏾
ySy8mcceTno,"So they have a slender man movie, bt still no half-life 3 or portal 3 :/
tisk tisk
priorities first"
ySy8mcceTno,How is that anything like the game ?
ySy8mcceTno,This is why movies based on games shouldn't be made.
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god the slender epidemic is upon us once again
ySy8mcceTno,So slender man doesn’t directly kill the victims. He make them kill them selves. Now he is even scarier.
ySy8mcceTno,Lol yesterday was watching a video about Slenderman then this happened
ySy8mcceTno,*E          D          G          Y*
ySy8mcceTno,who knew that a popular creppypasta turn into a movie might gives it a try
ySy8mcceTno,God damnit I was really hoping they were gonna make a proper slender man movie but it’s already looking rough
ySy8mcceTno,"“Hype”

-said no one"
ySy8mcceTno,Those two girls that killed there friend for slender man respect   must see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,...looks stupid. just like the game.
ySy8mcceTno,To late 3 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,Ya era hora de que sacaran la pinche pelicula
ySy8mcceTno,Oh no what have we done
ySy8mcceTno,what a retarded concept
ySy8mcceTno,"Creepy Pasta
*Upgrade*
Movie 
*Perfect-ish*"
ySy8mcceTno,"So they made a movie about Slender Man 




But where is the Five Nights at Freddy’s Movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,everyone is saying they wont see it since it came so late but we all know they are going to go see it
ySy8mcceTno,Getting into the trends a little late
ySy8mcceTno,"🎵
Slender man
Slender man 
Does whatever a slender man does🎵"
ySy8mcceTno,Makes me wish Marble Hornet still continued.
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone else know that Slenderman was in the Dollar Bill
ySy8mcceTno,Movie that was supposed to be out years ago and it’s not even that scary
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for this! been waiting for a film for years!
ySy8mcceTno,Dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,Omg
ySy8mcceTno,Now this looks like a bad fucking movie!
ySy8mcceTno,Looks dumb
ySy8mcceTno,Seriously
ySy8mcceTno,Guys let's be greatful this isn't a Jeff the Killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,?!??? No? NNNNNOOOOO
ySy8mcceTno,This is messed up haven't they heard of the two teens that killed a little girl
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie about this
ySy8mcceTno,"Dunno why, but Slenderman really doesn't seem like a good story to adapt into a large single-part film."
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry but destined to be a flop. Should've thought a little more outside the box but what do I know.
ySy8mcceTno,This is horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Bruh
ySy8mcceTno,MDSSSSS☺😈❤
ySy8mcceTno,a 1:51 j'ai chialé wesh
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe if this was uploaded 7 years ago I would see it
ySy8mcceTno,Hollow man was better
ySy8mcceTno,Most likely gonna suck pretty much every game companies turn into movies end up coming very  far from you expectations
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late to this don’t ya think
ySy8mcceTno,Oh Okay
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,This is a few years too late
ySy8mcceTno,This had better be way better than that bullshit on comcast I watched. With that one geeky kid from Freddy vs Jason...
ySy8mcceTno,wow rlly
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 Gay Elephant noise.... LittleKuriboh Fans welcome
ySy8mcceTno,Whats there to say about this?
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie hasn't even came out yet, but I already feel some type a way about the black girl killin herself ;-;"
ySy8mcceTno,Don’t think he’s relevant
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late but let’s hope it’s still worth watching
ySy8mcceTno,Now we know which Horror movie still start off being the first 2018 trash one.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony ur to late for this
ySy8mcceTno,Just great! Another man forcing himself on little girls in the middle of nowhere. An obvious Roy Moore biopic. #SlenderMoore
ySy8mcceTno,Can someone stop by my channel and give it a like.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m a highschooler at the moment and literally since the original game came out I’ve been needing to see this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait this movie be like 6 years 
late like if u agree"
ySy8mcceTno,"I would've expected it in 2013, not 5 years after its popular."
ySy8mcceTno,I didn’t think they would actually make it
ySy8mcceTno,"No endenti :l , I don't understand :l"
ySy8mcceTno,Lol nerds. What minecraft mod is this.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Really -_- ...
ySy8mcceTno,And that was 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,TBH I'm kinda hype for playing and recording Slenderman games this is so hype for me! Can't wait!
ySy8mcceTno,Yasss
ySy8mcceTno,sony needs to stop making movies
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,0/10 original scream not used
ySy8mcceTno,I clicked this video expecting a bunch of dislikes because I thought people would think this is stupid but i was suprised that 1/9 people disliked
ySy8mcceTno,Looks horrible
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks sick definitely would watch
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus Christ. This movie is 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,"I really hope theres not a jeff the killer movie 
Thats just a no"
ySy8mcceTno,this movie is 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,She didn’t collect all 8 notes
ySy8mcceTno,Cool. Just cool.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why can't you just leave him alone. He doesn't belong on the big screen. Slenderman is scary because of what the internet can do for something like him, I don't want to see Hollywood ruin him. I feel way to edgy for saying this but I don't want ""outsiders"" to muck up something that made the internet horror scene what it is today. Especially with all the ""Jeff the Killers"" and ""Eyeless Jack's"" which make people not take internet horror seriously we don't need a movie to drive people away even further. I know I'm basing all of this on preconceptions but I've seen things I'm passionate about get tarnished so often that my faith has just about run out. Please don't screw this up."
ySy8mcceTno,This is the wrong time to have a trailer for a movie that portrays suicide
ySy8mcceTno,"Im getting vibes similar to ""The Ring"" with the shots, mule worms, and robes"
ySy8mcceTno,And it turns out the big twist is Slender-Man is fucking Logan Paul killing people for views for his youtube channel.
ySy8mcceTno,FOR GODS SAKE
ySy8mcceTno,"Should’ve made this during 2012, smh"
ySy8mcceTno,why tho
ySy8mcceTno,"If they had just made it about the Slender Man stabbing incident that happened, that would be pretty creepy, especially because it's a true story, but this just looks lame."
ySy8mcceTno,Sooooo.... Stranger things Season 3?
ySy8mcceTno,"Errrrr, a slender man movie in 2018? Tf?"
ySy8mcceTno,Always watching a good slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, and only six years too late!"
ySy8mcceTno,This is stupid
ySy8mcceTno,This already looks hella boring.
ySy8mcceTno,2012 is calling back
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when I was little I used to be so terrified of slender man so I want to watch this just for the memories 😂😂😂
ySy8mcceTno,I was literally reading about this last night
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't get it. What the hell mean slenderman in the movie and more important, right now? I say, looks good but with other story, and I'm not convinced at all."
ySy8mcceTno,Hope it's not 85% talking and 15% stuff actually happening... like most scary movies these days.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow im scare
ySy8mcceTno,Look's boring
ySy8mcceTno,"Just a little bit late Sony
Actually, a lot late"
ySy8mcceTno,wack. This should’ve came out in like 2012 when slender man was actually believable
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man is getting greedy he wants more than 20 dollars now.
ySy8mcceTno,"*Namoral, ficou um lixo...*"
ySy8mcceTno,Too late
ySy8mcceTno,Why do I feel like this is cool but at the sametime I feel this is going to be a bad movie
ySy8mcceTno,I like how the trending list starts with Logan Paul's apologize and then a song called men in the woods and now slender man movie that takes place in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,"Once upon a time, a bunch of kids went crazy because they saw a shadow"
ySy8mcceTno,"Isn't this too late to be a movie, its irrelevant people probably don't even remember slenderman. AND WHERE IS PEWDIEPIE?!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,I will be disliking everything I see from now on. Including this comment.
ySy8mcceTno,No way a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Soooooo late but whatever looks ight
ySy8mcceTno,"*T H E  P E E - P E E  P O O  M A N*

Oh, wrong trailer. Sorry."
ySy8mcceTno,"GO HOME SONY YOU'RE DRUNK

NO NO  NO NO YOU PUT THAT CAMARA DOWN *NOW*"
ySy8mcceTno,1:26 logan paul laughs
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Edgy
ySy8mcceTno,They turned it in to a movie…oh wait this isn't stranger things
ySy8mcceTno,oh.
ySy8mcceTno,Never would’ve thought
ySy8mcceTno,Should've came out in 2012 or 2013
ySy8mcceTno,"I had this feeling that someday there would be a big bidget Slender movie
I was right after all"
ySy8mcceTno,I call 1.5/10
ySy8mcceTno,What's next? Herobrine movie? Jeff the killer? Smile dog? XD
ySy8mcceTno,*edgy 2009 creepypasta fans rejoice*
ySy8mcceTno,A little girl was murdered because her classmates believed in Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,This seems to be a gore movie more than a horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,don't look or it takes you
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh wow, a Slenderman movie, I guess Hollywood is all out of ideas."
ySy8mcceTno,trash
ySy8mcceTno,"It's cool to finally see a movie based on the Slender Man, it seems to be embracing a lot of the creepy lore that's been built around him over the years, and I like how the music at the end resembles the ambiance from the game. But there are a few issues I see. 1: Sony. 2: Slender Man doesn't have that huge of a presence in the trailer, if your not going to show the monster in the trailer or even that much in the movie itself, that's fine, The Babadook pulled that off really well, but here, not so much. You should feel Slender Man's presence as if he's looming over every shot, but aside from the end of the trailer, there isn't much of that. And 3, from the brief glimpse that we saw of Slender Man, it's nice that they kept the suit, but his face is all black and burned looking, rather than the haunting white that made him stand out from over monsters. And my final problem, this movie has come 6 years too late."
ySy8mcceTno,This might go better as a Sci-Fi channel series but this could work too.
ySy8mcceTno,Seriously Sony? Please not again!
ySy8mcceTno,5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Really Sony? Nobody cares about this anymore. You couldn't make Street Sharks or Biker Mice From Mars instead?
ySy8mcceTno,WOOO CREEPYPASTA FANS UNITE
ySy8mcceTno,0:43 all slenderman fanart posted from devianart
ySy8mcceTno,2012 pewdiepie would be ballin his eyes out rn
ySy8mcceTno,Too late
ySy8mcceTno,Straight to Netflix
ySy8mcceTno,"What is this? Looks good though. But Jeesh they gonna make a live-action out of everything now.
Next up: Fnaf!!"
ySy8mcceTno,stranger things????
ySy8mcceTno,If this is their way of apologizing for making the Emoji Movie we will have to see how good it truly is when it comes out
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man is so old I'm a skeleton
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for my friends to stab me in the woods.
ySy8mcceTno,Cough cough *IT* cough
ySy8mcceTno,"Marik and Bakura brought me here. They made a mistake, though, the gay elephant noise actually happens at 1:17 instead of 1:23 XD"
ySy8mcceTno,"We get this but nothing about our boys at the Foundation?
They’re much more marketable
-mainly cus no one tried to kill someone in their name-
And theres been a resurgence in interest in SCP because of Lord Bung
Hell at 0:50 there’s a bit that could fit well in an SCP movie
Like a scene with 106"
ySy8mcceTno,Half of the trailer black and white eye being picked at lol
ySy8mcceTno,If you’re going to make a Horror movie based off a video game at least make it off an actual terrifying game like Outlast (1 not 2)
ySy8mcceTno,This should've gone straight to dvd
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like Hollywood is always late to fads
ySy8mcceTno,*Can't wait!*
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice gay elephant noise at 1:23, truly great work, Johnathan."
ySy8mcceTno,This makes me want to gang up with a friend and bring a girl out into the woods and stab her a dozen times. Kek
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 You can really hear the Gay Elephant noise!
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf
ySy8mcceTno,Well here we go
ySy8mcceTno,How do you make a movie about a long slender guy in a suit with no face scary? The games you're at least lost in the woods collecting papers while he non aggressively pops out with a loud noise.
ySy8mcceTno,I’d have expected this movie to look a little bit more inventive tbh
ySy8mcceTno,"Old 2012 YouTube bait game, the movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yeah I love movies based off video games they all are so great and entertaining
ySy8mcceTno,Am I the only one who thought about stranger things when they go on the woods?
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 ketchup
ySy8mcceTno,We all know this was gonna happen a movie
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late lol
ySy8mcceTno,"He doesn't look like he's wearing a suit...so yeah, I think I'm good."
ySy8mcceTno,Why does this look like the bye bye man 2😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Sinister was the closest thing to a Slenderman movie. Though I do agree Sony is cashing in on the character rather late, I've been a fan of Creepypastas since I was in middle School and think there is still potential. Sci-fi channel introduced Channel Zero and there was the Slenderman documentary about the real life attempted murder. So the movie still has at least one leg to stand on. Do I think it'll be good? Probably not. Will I still go see it for the hell of it? Absolutely! I want to see how this plays out (just don't get crazy Sony and try a connected Creepypasta Universe or something....that would be too much)"
ySy8mcceTno,Really fucking late I remember wanting to see a slender movies in like 2014
ySy8mcceTno,So they took an old game from the past and made it a movie
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda has that Ring vibe too It
ySy8mcceTno,im so shook they filmed the science classroom part in my school
ySy8mcceTno,I preferred the Marik and Bakura original version.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony Pictures Is Gonna Go Downhill With All These Movie Trailers And Movies Coming Out That Lack Good Movie Plots #RipSony
ySy8mcceTno,It's gonna be bad
ySy8mcceTno,Oh
ySy8mcceTno,this looks like a fan made trailer from 2010
ySy8mcceTno,Ugh.
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks kinda of stupid with the maggots and the needle going into her eye, the film is trying to be about slender man being a ghost / demon. The film looks more like horrific disgusting film, the girl looked liked she was a freaking zombie for god sake"
ySy8mcceTno,looks bad
ySy8mcceTno,Oh heck no.
ySy8mcceTno,I might watch it if the ratings are good
ySy8mcceTno,So... Missing Girl and sucidal Kids... I think im good...
ySy8mcceTno,you're 4 years too late for this one panasonic
ySy8mcceTno,😊😋
ySy8mcceTno,Oh man does that look awful... I’m probably going to go see it
ySy8mcceTno,Yessssss
ySy8mcceTno,"ITS BEEN OVER 7 YEARS... AND NOOOOW A MOVIE COMES OUT???? ...BOY. 
BETTER BE SOME PROXYS IN THERE!!!!!!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp a dead meme from 5 years ago get its own movie, whats next, the bee movie movie"
ySy8mcceTno,A few years too late
ySy8mcceTno,No one is going to watch this. Maybe they would in 2010
ySy8mcceTno,The black goo stuff reminds me of those crawly things from prey
ySy8mcceTno,"Let me guess, slender man is only going to get 45 seconds of movie time"
ySy8mcceTno,"So, basically an hour and thirty minute Slipknot music video."
ySy8mcceTno,"First it was days,
then weeks,
then months,
then years,
but finally after 9 years...
Slender man is getting a movie😱😱"
ySy8mcceTno,"Does it look good ?? No . Would i watch it ?? No 
Thank you"
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,I’ve been waiting for a slender man movie since I was in 6th grade omfg 😩😩
ySy8mcceTno,"sony pictures... figures... they'd pump out something that hasnt been relevant since 2014. 
the movie looks like a boring generic horror movie  lol
another sony picture failure"
ySy8mcceTno,"I can already tell this movie is going to be terrible. I’d like it to be good, but it won’t be."
ySy8mcceTno,These dudes missed the hype train by a couple of years.
ySy8mcceTno,A little to late there my friend
ySy8mcceTno,This thing has been my fear since I was 9. I outgrew though because I big boy now...13
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony worker: ""Hey, I just found this site called *4CHAN* and it has a lot of good movie ideas! How about we make a movie about the popular videogame 'Slenderman'?



People who knew played the game in 2012 and think it's cringy: ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"""
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,Maybe this could be the start of a creepypasta cinematic universe?
ySy8mcceTno,Never in a million years would I think this would become a movie
ySy8mcceTno,They should just make a creepypasta movie
ySy8mcceTno,Too late to make a movie out of the urban legend. And this movie looks meh...
ySy8mcceTno,This is 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,no
ySy8mcceTno,Top 3 trending videos are all about woods...
ySy8mcceTno,Nooooooooo
ySy8mcceTno,Looks okay if this came out when slender man was still a thing the this could work
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn't look scary at all, sorry. All I kept thinking throughout this was, ""Slenderman. slenderman, just wants someone to hold my hand. Sick and tired of being on my own. Everytime I drop by, Pewdiepie starts to scream and cry. Can't they see I just want a friend."" Like, since when has slendy done any of the crap we see in this video? Never, all he does is sit in a fucking bathroom in some gated forest and places sticky note everywhere. He's not scary guys, he's just a millennial."
ySy8mcceTno,Emoji Move 2: Rise of the Digital Blackface 👴🏿
ySy8mcceTno,Nahh idk about this one :/
ySy8mcceTno,i bet the movie is going to be awesome :D
ySy8mcceTno,"Can someone please explain how Sony has the rights to Slenderman?? I'm genuinely confused.

Edit: Thank you everyone for responding. I really was confused/interested. Anyway I will kinda tilted so thank you because I didn't know it was a free to use character. Lol creepypasta fangirl.

ySy8mcceTno,At least it isnt Always Watching amirite??????
ySy8mcceTno,the same thing that happened with suicide with 13 reasons why might actually happen with this tbh.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is just about as scary as the real game 

So it's not scary at all"
ySy8mcceTno,best movie of 2012 already
ySy8mcceTno,Only took them about a decade to come out with this
ySy8mcceTno,Im soo horny
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, a decent Slender Man movie. So excited."
ySy8mcceTno,"Im all for it
Hate that freaking gane"
ySy8mcceTno,Late but I’ll still watch it
ySy8mcceTno,Just dont look back and you are safe
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, at this point, just stop. Who thought this was a good idea?"
ySy8mcceTno,You think this may actually be good?
ySy8mcceTno,Would’ve been good 6 years ago..
ySy8mcceTno,1:17 I didn’t know repunzel was in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks trash 

*Looks outside window and sees slenderman*

Best movie 2k18"
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like because of the stabbing around 4 years ago that was because of slender man this is going to be quite a controversial movie
ySy8mcceTno,No
ySy8mcceTno,When your hw assignment is late but you turn it in anyways
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, stick to making Playstation games.😂😭👍"
ySy8mcceTno,5 years to late
ySy8mcceTno,the beginning made my butt clench because of the bugs..
ySy8mcceTno,"I was a big fan of those atmospheric YouTube Slender series that were popular several years ago. I was legitimately scared by them--no small feat for low-budget, amateur horror. This looks more atmospheric and more original than I would have expected--seems like the director is trying some new things. I'll keep an eye on this one--if it's able to make me feel anything like Marble Hornets did, that'll be a success in my book."
ySy8mcceTno,This didn’t give me the vibes that i got from the actual games
ySy8mcceTno,You see I'm a guy who loves watching shitty scary movies with friends so this is good for me
ySy8mcceTno,Idk this looks interesting
ySy8mcceTno,Someone is gonna kill their best friend because of this movie just like last time
ySy8mcceTno,Well this will be a thing...
ySy8mcceTno,I know it’s late but as long as it’s good I won’t hate
ySy8mcceTno,Looks more interesting than the annual Insidious or Conjuring films...
ySy8mcceTno,"OK GUYS, who's ready to ride back to 2012? I miss that year lol."
ySy8mcceTno,where is the gay elephant noise?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,"Gonna watch this movie, good job Sony!"
ySy8mcceTno,Girl gets stabbed over this tale........let's make a movie of it......
ySy8mcceTno,I remember 6 years ago in elementary people would joke around about him while I was shitting myself
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is so crap
ySy8mcceTno,I saw Sony and Man and thought spider man .
ySy8mcceTno,Little too late guys the hypes been gone since 2013
ySy8mcceTno,"Not only is Slenderman out dated, but also in poor taste"
ySy8mcceTno,Oh god... 🤦‍♀️
ySy8mcceTno,have we not learned why this isnt a good idea
ySy8mcceTno,"1:23 for gay elephant noise.  

Best movie ever to be directed by Marik Ishtar."
ySy8mcceTno,Tbh you got to do something better than that to scare me like where I was expecting this  slenderman trailer to give me fear instead it kind only creeped me out instead of being scared
ySy8mcceTno,I mean.. I’ll check this out. The Creepypasta fandom isn’t dead yet. They just need to make more movies about the whole crew. (Still so into Creepypasta) I hope this movie will be good
ySy8mcceTno,Running out of ideas Hollywood
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things season 3 looks interesting!
ySy8mcceTno,"I've been waiting for this , can't wait to see in theaters"
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks awful, go watch Marble Hornets instead."
ySy8mcceTno,Someone must show Markiplier this!
ySy8mcceTno,The ring?
ySy8mcceTno,"What’s next, a Jeff The Killer movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,nothing scarier than a tall anorexic albino shadow ghost man in his 40's wearing a suit and tie
ySy8mcceTno,Y aparece jeff y lo viola v: a no verdad v:
ySy8mcceTno,Watching this with 1% battery made it more intense
ySy8mcceTno,"The main slender jumpscare seems really cheap, I would’ve liked it more if his arms/tentacles started slowly wrapping around the tree and pulled the woman away, it has much more scare factor"
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry but you’re 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,way too late.
ySy8mcceTno,Yes yes yes
ySy8mcceTno,I’m confuzzled
ySy8mcceTno,"Please don’t be sh*t, please don’t be sh*t, please don’t be sh*t"
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this trending with 173k views
ySy8mcceTno,*WHAT?*
ySy8mcceTno,They took too long to do this. Now it's too late.
ySy8mcceTno,This is most likely gonna be a cheap teenager attraction but since the story is old ( 2012 isn’t old but you get what I mean ) I’ll watch it no doubt but I hope it’s rated R cause that’ll give us more hope. And hopefully the backstory of him is explained and isn’t just a jump scare filled mess. And coming soon better mean August at most
ySy8mcceTno,this movie was better when it was know as Concrete Giraffes
ySy8mcceTno,Seems like one would find a lot of corpses in these woods... Logan and JT should check it out
ySy8mcceTno,Finally.
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s hope you make one movie right Sony
ySy8mcceTno,Of course its Sony pictures
ySy8mcceTno,"i used to be scared of this in like 2012 i got over it, try again"
ySy8mcceTno,Really nigga
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the troll face movie in 2020
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man the movie. 
Based on the best horror video game “Slender”. 






( please be a good one I’m begging you after seeing the Emoji movie)"
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul is going to shot a Vlog in those Woods Next!
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think the public needs another murder to happen after the first incident I will report to government that is is illegal to show to international/national public
ySy8mcceTno,Why would you want to 'See more Slender Man' when that would be missing the entire point of the  Slender Man concept to begin with?
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,This loooook awful
ySy8mcceTno,Eh I’ll go
ySy8mcceTno,This looks no different then the bye bye man
ySy8mcceTno,"What is it with studios being years late to the party?? First angry birds, the emojis, now this... what's next? Pogs?"
ySy8mcceTno,Why are they 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the gay elephant?
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks pretty interesting but can you imagine what that girl who nearly got murdered by her best friends over Slender Man would feel like seeing this trailer?
Just food for thought, I ain't saying they shouldn't make the movie because of what happened to her."
ySy8mcceTno,5 years later
ySy8mcceTno,10 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Why the hell did SONY MAKE THIS!!!! It should have been a good movie studio like Universal Studios or Warner Bros.
ySy8mcceTno,So this is practically the IT movie?
ySy8mcceTno,its was only a matter of time tbh.
ySy8mcceTno,This is kinda just a rip off of stranger things but I’ll still watch it
ySy8mcceTno,😂👌🏼
ySy8mcceTno,I miss 2012 :(
ySy8mcceTno,O man
ySy8mcceTno,10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Brasil?
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, why. First you made the emoji movie, now this. Next you should make a movie about amnesia and have guest star 2011 pewdiepie"
ySy8mcceTno,from the creators of the emoji movies comes slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,gonna be a flop
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are 6 years late...
ySy8mcceTno,doesn't look that good...sorry...
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be terrible lol
ySy8mcceTno,from the house that resident evil built
ySy8mcceTno,Yep. Bad looking.
ySy8mcceTno,Slenderman why not slendergirl?!? REEEEEE
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this a movie... I'm gonna see it.
ySy8mcceTno,Insert Idubbbs slender man Gangnam style here
ySy8mcceTno,This looks visually stunning but this might turn into a flop
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie about Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,WHY SONY WWHHHHYYYY!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Man it already gives me chills cause I'm wearing headphones
ySy8mcceTno,Your too l@te man if it was made/relesed 6/5 years ago when slenderman was popular it woild have ben a good one.
ySy8mcceTno,What year are we living in agian?
ySy8mcceTno,WTF THIS IS SO LATE
ySy8mcceTno,"it's 2018, the Slenderman movie drops now? y'all missed your chance to cash in"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, this is 2018 not 2012"
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta Cinematic Universe confirmed :v
ySy8mcceTno,"No freakin way. Like other peeps are saying, if this came out when Slender was actually a thing, I would've been like, ""Heck yeah!"""
ySy8mcceTno,"That doesn't look like slender man movie, u probably need to make the better slender man next time. 😐😒😑"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo. Is that suicide forest in japan?
ySy8mcceTno,"There is so much they could do with the slender mythos from back when it was popular but with the black and white flashing images this just comes off as a discount The Ring, I hope it will be better in theaters"
ySy8mcceTno,This woulda been good when pewdi and mark were playing it
ySy8mcceTno,Littlekuriboh brought me here! ^^
ySy8mcceTno,So now slender man's a He
ySy8mcceTno,you can hear the gay elephant noise  at 1;23
ySy8mcceTno,"That doesn't look like slender man movie, u probably need to make the better slender man next time. 😐😒😑"
ySy8mcceTno,Yay a movie no one asked for
ySy8mcceTno,"Horror movies, they play loud music and make you jump."
ySy8mcceTno,find all the 7 onion layers
ySy8mcceTno,Viruses don't get in your head.
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry, but this is just WAAAAAAAY to far past its time. Slenderman has been dead for years. This is quite late, Sony. First the emoji movie, now this."
ySy8mcceTno,This Looks Like A PG Rated Movie
ySy8mcceTno,This movie might be about 99% of the kids and 1% about the actual Slender Man
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this was over
ySy8mcceTno,Pewdiepie isn't in it so it's bad
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, 5 years late my dudes...."
ySy8mcceTno,I made a joke to my friend about the possibility of a Slenderman movie 5 years ago....I didn’t think someone would actually make this.
ySy8mcceTno,The 2012 creepypasta side of me is coming out. I hyped
ySy8mcceTno,a bit late this bloke
ySy8mcceTno,Is there anything Hollywood *CANT* ruin?
ySy8mcceTno,This is probably just about the court case
ySy8mcceTno,but its sony
ySy8mcceTno,I remember playing slenderman with my family and we would always argue wether he held a knife or not. Fun game. Scary game ;)
ySy8mcceTno,"A lot Better then I thought this was going to be...

I like the Use of the Church Bells & children Laughter. The Former Gives off the Vibe that ""Slenderman"" is something ""Demonic"". Which is the popular interpretation, but... I'm hoping for either a nice twist on it, or for no clear exact answer at all
... That Said....
My Favorite Aspect of the ""Slenderman"" has always been the ""Psychological"" one. The ""Ultimate Operator"", who breaks people until ""It"" gets what ""It"" wants. What Does ""It"" Want? By the time you figure it out, it's too late... But it's never the same every time

Best Hoping, I guess..."
ySy8mcceTno,"It’s too late to apologize,
It’s to late..."
ySy8mcceTno,I can just imagine that slender stabbing girl she is probably like oh hell no
ySy8mcceTno,"OK this movie looks pretty terrifying so I'm very excited to see it. I just hope this time it's good and not another ""Always Watching A Marble Hornets Story"", lord knows we don't need another bad slender man movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Please no just.. just stop
ySy8mcceTno,sally ? crepipasta ?
ySy8mcceTno,But like...what’s the plot lmk? 😂
ySy8mcceTno,Aw hell yeah ima definitely watch this
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for Bye Bye Man 2!
ySy8mcceTno,"1:51 ""Hey guys, booga booga."""
ySy8mcceTno,You do know this is 2018 right Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this ACTUALLY real? Wtf Sony?
ySy8mcceTno,Trash.
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope they don’t show much of him in this. I want him to be like a legend, this looming horror that you never really get to see, only the aftermath of his attacks. I find it more scary that way."
ySy8mcceTno,If only if came out years ago
ySy8mcceTno,I feel they could’ve done so much more with the movie if it wasn’t limited to being a corny tween movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like 2013 came back to haunt us again....
ySy8mcceTno,Watch it's gonna take an hour to fully see his body
ySy8mcceTno,I can't believe this is a thing
ySy8mcceTno,Little Kuriboh?
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger things vibes
ySy8mcceTno,"This is like 5 years late...whats next? ""Troll face and nyan cat save the day""?"
ySy8mcceTno,"You're 6 years late
Edit: OMG thank you for 2 likes."
ySy8mcceTno,"Based on this trailer, this movie could be okay........or REALLY REALLY BAD. I can't stand cheap scream and jump scare...it cheapen the movie."
ySy8mcceTno,YESYESYES
ySy8mcceTno,#NotMySlender
ySy8mcceTno,Why are people still going crazy about some bald guy in a suit...?
ySy8mcceTno,2 girls murdered another and they blamed it on him
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope three girls don’t try to kill each other over this movie..
Like what happened back in 2012..."
ySy8mcceTno,Dead meme
ySy8mcceTno,disgusting.  kids have already murdered kids in real life over this...but lets make a horror movie anyway...
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, it actually looks creepy."
ySy8mcceTno,Not sure if I just saw a Nine Inch Nails video or a movie trailer..
ySy8mcceTno,"Slendy had better be wearing a suit and not just be some veiny, black, vaguely human-shaped mass."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks awful.
ySy8mcceTno,Nooo way! no... way! You can't do this. This is wrong. Turn back and save your jobs while you still can.
ySy8mcceTno,"This all seems... a bit silly, to be honest.

I mean, your usual teen characters, various scenes of body horror, gore, loud screamings and something that sounds like the Slenderman... roaring? Come on, this character desserves way better than all this generic horror movie clichés. 

All the scare associated to the Slenderman (and to the games where he appeared) is about the unknown. You don't know what this creature is. You don't know what it can do. You don't know how to escape it, destroy it, or even if you can do either of that. Heck, you're not even sure what it does to its victims (even if Marblehornets has invented some answers about that). In a way, the Slenderman is almost Lovecraftian.

From my point of view, that's what should be at the core of a movie. An uncatchable, mysterious being come from nowhere, plunging a small town in paranoia only by the rumour of its appearances. A silent, unstoppable hunter that would tirelessly go after the protagonists, forcing them to use all their wits and resist the growing hold of madness and terror to escape it. Just a shadow, briefly seen in the mist of a foggy forest.


Now, I'm not saying the movie will be bad. Being attached to the original creepypasta, I actually hope this adaptation will do justice to it. But this trailer really leaves me with the feeling they got it all wrong. To do a good Slenderman movie, you don't need that much. You don't need insects coming out of the mouth of a girl. You don't need teenagers committing suicid in spectacular and gory way. You don't need a series of loud jumpscares.
You just need a progressive descent into terror, using a dark forest, a dying flashlight, and a note saying ""DON'T LOOK BEHIND YOU""."
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,Im ok with this
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the Movie you had to make from the bomb that was the Emoji Movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I would’ve made it scarier. I wrote a script when I was in high school when this game was all the hype.
ySy8mcceTno,Sony sucks.  Why are they still insulting human intelligence by making movies?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a fan film?
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey guys! I would like to be in the movie! 

Like if anyone gets the reference..."
ySy8mcceTno,Oooooooooo 2spooky4me
ySy8mcceTno,Hasta que al fin!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this kinda fucked up to make especially after that girl got stabbed.
ySy8mcceTno,Let this shitty creepypasta die already
ySy8mcceTno,Is this a real movie
ySy8mcceTno,1:34 Ayla?
ySy8mcceTno,They made a movie about me how great
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, after years of waiting, the first trailer of Slender Man comes to us..."
ySy8mcceTno,Yooooo who's a dashie fan? Y'all know that slender is his homie!
ySy8mcceTno,Brings back memories from 2012
ySy8mcceTno,I fangirled so much over this.
ySy8mcceTno,If this came out 5 years ago it would be great
ySy8mcceTno,"I think they might be able to pull this off, but I think they're a bit too late"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man ~ more like considerably fat man
ySy8mcceTno,I don't think I've ever seen another trailer that was trying this hard.
ySy8mcceTno,"I...um....I don't know how to feel about this. A part of me is saying, ""YES! FINALLY!!!!"" but another part of me is saying, ""Wait, what was that! Is that what slender man does to people now!?! This doesn't look anything like the games!"" I just hope it is at least good."
ySy8mcceTno,Nah
ySy8mcceTno,Oof
ySy8mcceTno,"Part of me wants this to be good. I like the lack of slender man. That’s what most horror movies do best, not explaining or no showing what the monster is. As soon as you know what it is and how it works, it’s not scary. It becomes tangible. What we can’t see and can’t explain is what is the most terrifying to the human mind."
ySy8mcceTno,This looks so bad.
ySy8mcceTno,Raawwrr
ySy8mcceTno,This isn't 2010
ySy8mcceTno,This looks interesting.
ySy8mcceTno,"Don’t is on FIRE! First the Emoji Movie, and now THIS! I’m just gonna ignore Spider-Man Homecoming 😉🤫😤"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm ready
ySy8mcceTno,They should have made found footage style
ySy8mcceTno,Can't beat the Emoji Movie
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim  no
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh god no, i'm getting serious bye bye man feels from this trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,"Why, just why?"
ySy8mcceTno,"10 years late on this one,guys"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm just here for the gay elephant.
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,"I can tell this would be a waste to spend  money to see,nah I'm gd"
ySy8mcceTno,"Most anticipated movie of 2012. Yall late for this one, but I hope it sells well on box office because I KNOW those creepypasta fans are gonna watch it"
ySy8mcceTno,"Eh, not enough SlenderMan. That's line showing Chucky trailer and only showing Chuck 1 time in a 2:39 trailer smh"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sorry Sony, but your 6 years late."
ySy8mcceTno,"If I didn’t know this was about Slender Man, I would’ve never guessed what this was a movie for, it looks like every other modern horror movie (with some exceptions)."
ySy8mcceTno,They're gonna find a dead guy in the woods
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for edgy teenagers to kill themselves by the truckloads.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hollywood really is running out of ideas.

But that doesn't stop me from me actually interested in this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Looks good! Please don't be pg-13.
ySy8mcceTno,"No, just no"
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm surprised this even exists. I thought slender man died off a few years ago, but he's still my favorite creepypasta."
ySy8mcceTno,you got to be kidding me! A film about slender man? I'm sorry but the horror genre is basically dead. I hate to say but it's true. This film will not end well with critics.
ySy8mcceTno,Edgy
ySy8mcceTno,"Idk, looks like it'll just be gross. Not necessarily scary."
ySy8mcceTno,01:23 you can hear the gay elephant noise
ySy8mcceTno,You're a couple years late sony
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is like 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,Jesus Christ
ySy8mcceTno,"OK they don't get slender man at all first up the tagline should be always watching (no eyes) second off its all about the games as a pose to the actual slender verse and don't pretend it will give you answers it won't it will just pander to normies and we'll, be lucky to have a cameo from the actual cast      of the universe I have no doubt that this will bomb just like channel 0 did in short 20 dollars mode was more faithful and indie horror should stay indie"
ySy8mcceTno,Next up is Jeff The Killer
ySy8mcceTno,kind of hope it's psychological horror.
ySy8mcceTno,Now if this was 2012 when the game was actually scary .
ySy8mcceTno,Um finally
ySy8mcceTno,meh.
ySy8mcceTno,"Where is Jonathan, the gay elephant?"
ySy8mcceTno,"The noises made by slenderman don't really match too well. I also think they are taking the psychological bits too far. Should be a simple, well-made horror movie about a missing girl, a silent but terrifying monster, and a mildly twisting ending."
ySy8mcceTno,OMG
ySy8mcceTno,JUST WATCH MARBLE HORNETS GUYS
ySy8mcceTno,Looks decent. Im going to go see it and hopefully I'm surprised by it.
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna suck. I already know.
ySy8mcceTno,I get the ring vibe
ySy8mcceTno,movie gonna be wack
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like another stupid fail of a horror movie. -.-
ySy8mcceTno,Please let it die.
ySy8mcceTno,What next Charlie Charlie the Movie
ySy8mcceTno,So he’s not actually even in the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I was hoping Slenderman would pop up just to say “You can’t see me”.
ySy8mcceTno,Hey Guys Buga Buga
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like trash
ySy8mcceTno,God has left us.
ySy8mcceTno,S P O O P Y

ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Little late
ySy8mcceTno,I’m quite excited to see the movie. But it’s disappointing seeing people with negative thought already even though this is just a trailer. Eh. It’s their opinions. I’m excited though so ^^
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 Gay elephant noise.
ySy8mcceTno,I felt embarrassed watching this
ySy8mcceTno,Looks a little cringy
ySy8mcceTno,this is 2018 not 2012..but honestly it doesnt look _that_ bad
ySy8mcceTno,I can't tell if this is for nostalgia or if Sony is pulling an Ajit Pai and thinks Slender Man is still popular in 2017
ySy8mcceTno,"WoooooooooW!!!!!!
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.QFGames.rabbitrunplanet"
ySy8mcceTno,"I like how it goes for the more possessing side of the story, like how he makes people so terrified that they do what he wants"
ySy8mcceTno,"#CanYouSeeHim
That's the reason why he isn't appearing in the trailer at all.
If it wouldn't have said Slenderman in the trailer I would have thought that this a movie about Boogeyman"
ySy8mcceTno,I remember when Slender Man was cool (during the Marble Hornets run).
ySy8mcceTno,1:23 - Hear that sound? That's Jonathan the Gay Elephant.
ySy8mcceTno,"1:42 look at this dude. Oh no, AHAAHAHA LOOK AT HIS FACE 1:52. AHAAA LOOK AT THIS DUDE"
ySy8mcceTno,They turned it into a movie? Wow...
ySy8mcceTno,i didnt see a white blank face and no tux
ySy8mcceTno,So... The Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,Meh seems alright
ySy8mcceTno,Never thought they'd actually make movie of this.
ySy8mcceTno,way to capitalize on a six year old game
ySy8mcceTno,...hoo boy...
ySy8mcceTno,Finally... after 10 long years
ySy8mcceTno,Oh look... Another jump scare filled trailer with a lot of cutscenes and some GarageBand music and sound effects
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are like 7 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks corny and bad
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,"Directed by the same guy who brought you Stomp the Yard, The Losers, & I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer..........yeah, I bet I'll find this at the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart soon."
ySy8mcceTno,Well this is about 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,OMFG!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I can't find the gay elephant.... D:
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone else hear the gay elephant noise at 1:23?
ySy8mcceTno,"This is 2018, why's Slenderman still here no"
ySy8mcceTno,Why don't you just turn on the sun at night so you don't have to deal with him?
ySy8mcceTno,#ISawHim
ySy8mcceTno,Is this actually legit
ySy8mcceTno,Judging by all the hardcore and grossed out imagery I think this movie might be rated-R. :\
ySy8mcceTno,Like if you’re here before a million and knew this movie would come one day 😂👌🏼
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is gonna suck it looks corny and cheap and they're a little late it's not 2011 anymore
ySy8mcceTno,"How many tries does it take for sony to make a good movie?






The world may never know"
ySy8mcceTno,Zon’t let ze Zlender mans catch you
ySy8mcceTno,#canyouseehim
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully it has some legit scary moments instead of lazy jump scares
ySy8mcceTno,Sony is only distributing the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Al fin sale el trailer de mi película favorita y tan esperada.  ❤❤
ySy8mcceTno,ok. lets see how this goes
ySy8mcceTno,Let's play a drinking game. Every time a little girl gets stabbed as a sacrifice to Slenderman take a sip of vodka. You'll probably die of liver failure by the second week the movie is out
ySy8mcceTno,"If the Sony logo didn't convince you this would be awful, the tryhard Jacob's Ladder-esque visuals should have."
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY! This guy needed a movie back in 2011!
ySy8mcceTno,Omg I can't wait
ySy8mcceTno,"Come on man. I really hate these crappy, dimly lit, low budget fan films posing as the real thing...Oh wait..."
ySy8mcceTno,They could have made a really cool IT/Stranger Things type of vibe. That would have made an awesome movie. This looks like utter garbage
ySy8mcceTno,"It feels like its going to be more of the ""effects"" of Slender man instead of the actual Slender himself"
ySy8mcceTno,Espero que no la caguen como dragon ball super :v
ySy8mcceTno,"This... actually looks competent. Due to Slender Man's reputation when it comes to movies, I doubt it will be winning any awards, but who knows? I'm probably gonna check it out, and maybe I'll actually like it."
ySy8mcceTno,hmmmm a little to late don't ya think.
ySy8mcceTno,"Don't say it, don't think it."
ySy8mcceTno,I forgot that Slender man existed
ySy8mcceTno,First the emoji movie now a dead game? Really Sony
ySy8mcceTno,If this is going to be a good movie it has to have more than slender man
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is almost 6 years late
ySy8mcceTno,really disappointed Marble Hornets isn't in any of this.
ySy8mcceTno,"This is America. Should be ""Moderately Obese Man"""
ySy8mcceTno,If there is a ending cut to this movie it should evil ghost chairs flying.
ySy8mcceTno,Like 5 years later.
ySy8mcceTno,For a second i thought this was another Ring movie
ySy8mcceTno,this just feels like some btec stranger things movie
ySy8mcceTno,This *chuckles* does put a smile on my face
ySy8mcceTno,"10/10 can predict this will be similar to The Blair Witch Project in the sense that we probably will see the Slender Man about once, and everything is else is suspense. It's very similar to Ouija and Blair Witch. Does not look appealing at all. Could've been better. This just looks like another fan film."
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie based off a stale creepypasta? lolno, I'm calling it now, its gonna be a flop, nothing about the premise nor the nonexistent plot can salvage this, because it was already pretty bad back in 2012 anyways.

I don't think anyone will actually want to watch this besides people that are curious as to how they can even make this work, and people that think PewDiePie is entertaining, which mainly includes kids.

And let the poorly composed and grammatically incorrect hate messages flow forth."
ySy8mcceTno,LOGAN PAULLLLL😡
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s bring the slender game back also make him famous again
ySy8mcceTno,Way to be six years late to this party.
ySy8mcceTno,#TallWhiteMen
ySy8mcceTno,This reminds me of all those 2012 slender man fan movies
ySy8mcceTno,0:31 Is it just me or is the right side of the video stuttering when the camera pans down?
ySy8mcceTno,Who gave the rights to Sony?!
ySy8mcceTno,"It took me a while to realize the second that girl turned her back towards Slender Man, he was already next to her by the tree. What I thought was another tree was his eerie suit."
ySy8mcceTno,Cinematic universe for these anthology stories
ySy8mcceTno,I hope the original creator of Slenderman knows about this.
ySy8mcceTno,"Why does this film exist, it's too late to cash in on the Slenderman creppypasta meme."
ySy8mcceTno,Would have liked to see them take the marble hornets route. This just kind of looks like the usual jump scare reskin.
ySy8mcceTno,Next film: Dear David
ySy8mcceTno,And here comes the slender men memes...
ySy8mcceTno,I prefer slendytubbies
ySy8mcceTno,one step closer to fnaf
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypastafangirl just died because she can't watch it because she's under 18... Whyyyyy T.T
ySy8mcceTno,I want it to be a well made movie so bad but I know it’s gonna suck
ySy8mcceTno,Just going to see this for nostalgia from 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"To all of you complaining about the lack of Slenderman, that's the point. Seeing Slenderman can kill you (well it does in the game, we'll have to wait and see for the movie)

For most of the game you're trying to AVOID him, he doesn't show up every 5 seconds trying to chase you or have long drawn out murders. For most of it you're walking in the dark looking for pages. The actual game has less than a minute of Slenderman in it."
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when someone was actually killed because of this... I remember
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when 2 girls almost killed another girl because of slender man? I remember.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally
ySy8mcceTno,I have really high hopes for this movie.
ySy8mcceTno,C'est quoi cette merde rien à voir avec la creepy pasta slenderman 🖕🖕
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay but I have a question..
Will the rake be in it?
Or maybe like.. one proxy?
No?
Okay.."
ySy8mcceTno,"Now we need the rest of the popular Creepypasta's like Jeff The Killer, Eyeless Jack and others ._."
ySy8mcceTno,About time they make a movie about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Ke riko
ySy8mcceTno,i dont get how all this relates to slender man besides the missing child and the obvious appearance of the man around 1:50
ySy8mcceTno,The scariest thing in the trailer was the sound of the marker on the mirror
ySy8mcceTno,Wow
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks ok, but I don't think it will play near me due to what happened in my city. Believe me or not the girls who tried to kill their friend for slenderman went to my school in elementary and middle school."
ySy8mcceTno,"Really hope this lives up to the legacy of Marble Hornets and other webseries. 
There have been Slenderman movies before, and they were all horrible. 
Let’s all pray that this one is at least decent."
ySy8mcceTno,"Come on Sony, don't fail me."
ySy8mcceTno,Are we sure that this isn't one of the leftover tapes from The Ring series?
ySy8mcceTno,How 2 capitalism 101
ySy8mcceTno,If this was directed by James Wan it would be *SO* much scarier.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like a knockoff excorsist featuring Slender. 90% gonna be the worst horror film of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS.
ySy8mcceTno,well it's Sony so hopefully they don't screw it up.... I seriously don't know what I just saw
ySy8mcceTno,i already kill him
ySy8mcceTno,Ft LP
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah I’m watching
ySy8mcceTno,I hope there is at least one or 2 sences in where we get a decent full body shot of him and or him and what he does to victims. Even if it pulls this movie well into the R rating. I see promise but also I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to see a full body shot of him
ySy8mcceTno,Your 3 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I want fnaf movie where's it at sony
ySy8mcceTno,Did someone forget to let sony know Slender man stopped being relevant like 4 years ago?
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the first theatrical Slender Man movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Because what better time for Sony to do this than 7 years after it was popular.
ySy8mcceTno,I used to love reading about this stuff as a kid
ySy8mcceTno,Atleast this one is scary.
ySy8mcceTno,Who's the main character?
ySy8mcceTno,This is what we all wanted
ySy8mcceTno,I thought It was 2018 not 2012
ySy8mcceTno,No Tim Sutton? No Troy Wanger? No Joseph? This sucks.
ySy8mcceTno,yeah this is cool but have you seen 🆂🅻🅴🅽🇩🅴🇷🇲🅰🅽                🅶🅰🅽🅶🅽🅰🇲 🆂🆃🆈🅻🅴!!?!???
ySy8mcceTno,"Um, slender man was 5 years ago... :\"
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,Best thing that I have seen today! I can't wait till it comes out!😆 Though I hope they don't ruin it😑
ySy8mcceTno,No please stop this is actually cancer
ySy8mcceTno,YESYESYESYES—
ySy8mcceTno,Where the hell is my movie! 😡
ySy8mcceTno,"Remember, he's a silent fucker. Don't give him any voices or noises. Clicks will do."
ySy8mcceTno,from the guys that brought you the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,Where is slender man at? Disliked trailer!
ySy8mcceTno,The Slender man jump scare would've be ten times better if it turned out he was the tree she was hiding behind.
ySy8mcceTno,"this isnt slender man, slender man has a suit lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Yo this movie looking scary af
ySy8mcceTno,Little bit late buddy
ySy8mcceTno,"T
R
A
S
H"
ySy8mcceTno,Let's just hope it's actually *good* and not a *crappy* movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Hey lets turn a young girl traumatic experience into a movie and make a movie
ySy8mcceTno,NO FUCKING WAY
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer seems to be almost entirely missing someone important... It looks more like a remake of the Grudge, or the Ring that just happens to have a tall guy in the woods."
ySy8mcceTno,I give a d for a little effort put into making the trailer and the movie is probably going to be in F I'm just trying to make this comment as long as possible so you know I'm just going to keep on rambling hey did you see that episode of Steven Universe yesterday it was pretty good so how's your weekend guys Happy New Year's Merry Christmas 2018 it will be better then last 2
ySy8mcceTno,This could be either really good or terribly bad
ySy8mcceTno,They're just now doing this? Years after the topic kind of died?
ySy8mcceTno,After the simply terrible Marble Hornets movie adaption I full heartedly hope this does the Slenderman justice as a triple A movie. I'm still not super hyped as really all the Slenderverse webseries really can't be outdone but I'm extremely interested to see this take on Slenderman. :) See a constructive non-angsty comment
ySy8mcceTno,Meh....
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for the five nights at Freddy's movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Oooo look the woods LP
ySy8mcceTno,Movie came out of the trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmmm, kinda got some The Ring vibes from this. We'll see."
ySy8mcceTno,It/taken remake
ySy8mcceTno,bruh
ySy8mcceTno,This movie was inevitable... I just hope they don’t get caught up in the meme and actually put together a good story. Simplicity makes for good horror in my opinion
ySy8mcceTno,What do they mean by #Canyouseehim? What is he John Cena?
ySy8mcceTno,Hahahaha so funny...
ySy8mcceTno,Bit too late if you ask me
ySy8mcceTno,NO FUCKING WAY!
ySy8mcceTno,"Ehh, maybe if it came out a few years earlier :/"
ySy8mcceTno,Intriguing
ySy8mcceTno,Let's make a movie about a monster guy who was so feared and admired that children stabbed their friends 51 times in order to hopefully access his mansion. It seems like a great idea.
ySy8mcceTno,1:20 made me laugh so hard.
ySy8mcceTno,The Emoji Movie 2: Slenderman takes over your phone
ySy8mcceTno,"Whats worse? A big slender man movie in 2017, or that logan paul video"
ySy8mcceTno,"Anyone remember when slenderman was popular




Me neither"
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine if idubbz made an appearance doing gangum style
ySy8mcceTno,I am actually glad they didn't show slenderman much. that's the whole point of it all. suspense. environment. the knowledge that you can't see him makes him scarier because you know he is still there.....watching you....getting closer and closer and closer until he decides it's time to kill you.
ySy8mcceTno,I knew there wasn't much plot to make this game a movie but if there's pages on trees and a lot of walking in the woods with flashlights I'll see it
ySy8mcceTno,Literally should be about slender man and him chasing people not whatever this is that's what people wanna see like it was originally
ySy8mcceTno,Whoever edited this trailer deserves to be brought out back and shot
ySy8mcceTno,Why is this movie out now if the game came out like 5 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh my god Jake Paul suicide forest, man in the woods, and this all trending, what a timing"
ySy8mcceTno,The Emoji Movie 2: Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,Whats so bad about this movie? It seems fine to me... I don't know why people always say that every movie is bad.
ySy8mcceTno,The Bye Bye Man 2!!! I cant wait...😔
ySy8mcceTno,SIgh.
ySy8mcceTno,flm apa ni slinder man???????
ySy8mcceTno,Featuring Logan Paul.
ySy8mcceTno,“He gets in your head”bye bye man much🤔
ySy8mcceTno,"New Pewdiepie let's play?


*Very Nice*"
ySy8mcceTno,"If this is good, then it's the second time a adaptation of a video game is good."
ySy8mcceTno,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K2YUbF7O6VQ
ySy8mcceTno,"Hope this will be the next babadook, where the monster in the film is rarely seen just like here in the trailer. Makes it more mysterious and creepy imo"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man vs pennywise ? Who would win
ySy8mcceTno,"Why, Just why does this need to exist"
ySy8mcceTno,This is 10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,I hoped this would be a joke but nope
ySy8mcceTno,“U can’t see me” John cena
ySy8mcceTno,this trailer was terrible
ySy8mcceTno,"Nice to see Sony finally reached 2012. ""Will slender man have a white face and black suit?"" ""Of course no!"""
ySy8mcceTno,Where tf is our fnaf movie lmao
ySy8mcceTno,why
ySy8mcceTno,I don’t think they should be making this movie because a girl was almost killed and the two other girls who almost killed her are in prison and one of them is being treated for mental illness because of this “phenomenon”
ySy8mcceTno,This is an official trailer?!? Looks more like a teaser
ySy8mcceTno,Some of this stuff is were It feels like sony has never played slender man games cause I never recall slender doing any of that stuff only kidnaping and making you go crazy but some of those things doesn't make sense also were was slender in the trailer we only saw him once.
ySy8mcceTno,Op[
ySy8mcceTno,"You know what’s scary 
Downloading the game illegally and the FBI at your doo5,7$jjdgguejeveumecejej"
ySy8mcceTno,1:15 Worst Sound Ever
ySy8mcceTno,I can’t believe how far the concept of slender man has come.
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks awful, also they're about 8 years off the hype train this ever had."
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s his suit?
ySy8mcceTno,Wow sony gj on being 5 years late
ySy8mcceTno,wtf is going on
ySy8mcceTno,wtf did i just watch
ySy8mcceTno,NOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT HIM TOO LATE NOW
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like not a great one
ySy8mcceTno,Uh okay
ySy8mcceTno,B R A S I L
ySy8mcceTno,Hell yea its real
ySy8mcceTno,lol okay
ySy8mcceTno,This look like a horrible student film shot on a phone attempting to rip off The Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,"I hate to be the one saying this, but Sony is 4 years too late on this trend.
Still, not as late as the Emoji Movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks more like a horror movie not a slenderman movie
ySy8mcceTno,Kinda late
ySy8mcceTno,That girl in class though
ySy8mcceTno,Like stay inside your house. Seriously. Who the hell goes outside in the woods when people are missing?! Lol #slendersucksmaD
ySy8mcceTno,"Not scary at all
Watches first second of vid 
JESUS CRHIST THIS IS ALREADY SCARY!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should've been released in 2014 or 2015
ySy8mcceTno,Six years too late...
ySy8mcceTno,Idk if we need more people stabbing things and saying slender did it....
ySy8mcceTno,2018 and slender man has a movie. What
ySy8mcceTno,1:56 I swear this is an orgasm sound
ySy8mcceTno,Garlic Johansson
ySy8mcceTno,Idk guys....
ySy8mcceTno,The fan made Movie was better than this
ySy8mcceTno,wHY
ySy8mcceTno,1:42 slender man was 2 in areas at the same time. My immersion is blown.
ySy8mcceTno,"not hating, but why is 2018 already starting out like 2017....."
ySy8mcceTno,Was not expecting this at all
ySy8mcceTno,They should make a version with an all female cast and call it Slender Woman.
ySy8mcceTno,"What the hell is even happening in this trailer? This is a sloppy trailer and looks worse than the Bye Bye Man. By the way, 2012 called and said they wanted their meme back"
ySy8mcceTno,No.
ySy8mcceTno,Let’s not forget that this is based off of a game that’s main mechanic is turning a flashlight off and on.
ySy8mcceTno,Is Slender Man wearing a suit and has a blank face?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks awesome pause not
ySy8mcceTno,Yes it took them like 6 years
ySy8mcceTno,"A few years late there, Sony."
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Of course Sony has to capitalize on something that is no longer popular.  Slender Man was at the peak of it's popularity back in 2012. I bet nobody today even knows what Slender Man is.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late but still hype tho
ySy8mcceTno,Better be good because I've been waiting years for this
ySy8mcceTno,"The first slender man movie (yes, there actually is one) sucks. Wouldn't mind some redemptiom, here. 😉✌"
ySy8mcceTno,Was the original creator on board with this?
ySy8mcceTno,They are five years late...
ySy8mcceTno,Are you kidding...
ySy8mcceTno,This better be the most fire horror movie of the year. You got the time advantage
ySy8mcceTno,I mean it doesn't look bad.....but this trailer isn't that gud tbh
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf how did I get here I was watching Lego movies trailers
ySy8mcceTno,Is there going to be 8 pages in the movie?
ySy8mcceTno,Where the hell am I? The weird side of YouTube. Better than Jake and Logan Paul. 🤷🏻‍♀️
ySy8mcceTno,I fell up the stairs 15 times today...
ySy8mcceTno,Finally finally I been waiting for some kind of movie about slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Why is sony making a movie on this now this is so 2013
ySy8mcceTno,Now we need the FNAF movie trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Is it a real trailer?
ySy8mcceTno,wow what today is political correctness and in the court of public opinion where you're guilty no matter what I can't believe Sony was able to make this movie after that little girl killed her friend the two teenagers there I'm sure there were more deaths that we just never heard of but the girl killed her friend stabbed her to death 20 or 30 times because Slenderman told her to do it or she was scared of him some s*** like that I don't know what the point of the game is all I know is it's a f****** stupid
ySy8mcceTno,"Well,





This certainly brings back memories...."
ySy8mcceTno,You’re 5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta cinematic universe?
ySy8mcceTno,I WOULD SO WATCH THIS MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,"wat
slenderman isnt scary
most people who were scared of it were kids in 2011"
ySy8mcceTno,They finally worried a bout this movie like if you agree
ySy8mcceTno,That girl that killed her friends so she could see slender man is probably feeling herself in jail
ySy8mcceTno,H A S H T A G.   D E D.    G A M E S
ySy8mcceTno,This is basically the bye bye man  vol. 2
ySy8mcceTno,"The last time I heard about Slenderdick was when that girl blamed him for her stabbing her friend 16 times. I mean, I would rather be stabbed 100 times then see another video game movie, but I would also rather injest dogshit like a vaccum cleaner than see this so I guess that isn't saying much. Anyway, this movie can suck my slightly above average sized penis."
ySy8mcceTno,That actually looks interesting
ySy8mcceTno,But...why
ySy8mcceTno,Eh...
ySy8mcceTno,You'd expect a movie trailer about Slender Man to SHOW  clips of Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,Why would they make this after that girl got stabbed because of it.. eh do whatever for money I guess
ySy8mcceTno,About fucking time waited 6 years for this
ySy8mcceTno,"Do you hear that? It's... It's...






The 2012 Markiplier coming back"
ySy8mcceTno,"I hope this comes out soon I was going to the movies next week and watch insidious the last key but I saw this so I want to watch this I told my mother about slender man's story she said it's crazy but I hope it comes out soon and I convince my mom to watch it 

btw thx for the trailer"
ySy8mcceTno,Wow...
ySy8mcceTno,Next from Sony pictures “the annoying orange movie”
ySy8mcceTno,Doesn’t look like anything that has to do with Slenderman so... how about no
ySy8mcceTno,This should have come out like 3 years ago..
ySy8mcceTno,Yessssssss I've been waiting soooo long for this to come out im so happy
ySy8mcceTno,This looks something awful...
ySy8mcceTno,"just watch dark harvest, marble hornets, nomanhybrid, tribe twelve, i can tell probably better than this movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Can wait!
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, Only 7 years late"
ySy8mcceTno,Omg....
ySy8mcceTno,"It seems they're going for a Slender: The Arrival route more than the original eight pages game. Regardless, I'm definitely going to see this and the fact that the trailer isnt' actually bad is a huge plus lol"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks crap very underwhelming
ySy8mcceTno,I basically just watched the whole fucking movie right here. But I’m still gonna go to the movies
ySy8mcceTno,Watch when this becomes worst movie of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,Nah Bruh Nahhhhh
ySy8mcceTno,Why I am worried. Well they might make the other creepypastas into movies too...
ySy8mcceTno,Made by Sony but it looks like YouTube Red made this😑
ySy8mcceTno,when are we gonna see the venom vs slender man movie
ySy8mcceTno,A little behind the curve
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait for IHE to make a video about this!
ySy8mcceTno,Who else thought the title said spider man
ySy8mcceTno,I'll watch it but they should have made this movie in like 2011 at its peak lol.
ySy8mcceTno,This looks really shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,Eh
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully sony won't screw this up.
ySy8mcceTno,1:51 I saw him😱
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like Sony is stepping up their game this year
ySy8mcceTno,Time to write a strongly-worded letter.
ySy8mcceTno,looks like 2018 is 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"El trailer le falta mas historia, no sé"
ySy8mcceTno,"Se ve de la gran mierda.

En la producción: Hay que meter clichés en exceso, gente joven que desaparece, un alma que les obliga matarse y screamers de mierda = Slenderman :v"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wait, slender man's black?"
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be the best movie of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,"Bruh the trailer gave me chills, I couldn’t watch this 😂"
ySy8mcceTno,A little late
ySy8mcceTno,Just felt like a Ring Trailer. Another waste of money.
ySy8mcceTno,Game fucking sucks but hopefully the movie will do way better. You know a story to tell.
ySy8mcceTno,Ready to be having nightmares
ySy8mcceTno,Featuring logan paul and the japanese kid
ySy8mcceTno,This look fals
ySy8mcceTno,"THIS IS BODY SHAMING!!!! 
Hahaha 🖕😎🖕"
ySy8mcceTno,*Y LAS OCHO NOTAS?* UwU
ySy8mcceTno,Straight to DVD release! I'm calling it
ySy8mcceTno,H y
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't look terrible at all
ySy8mcceTno,Spooky
ySy8mcceTno,Oh yeah bye bye man 2.0
ySy8mcceTno,"They did it.
The madmen actually did it.

The trailer looked a little interesting, but it was the lack of information that made it less so."
ySy8mcceTno,Lol I thought this was a very dark Spiderman trailer by the title and thumbnail
ySy8mcceTno,Okay why is everything on trending about the woods...
ySy8mcceTno,Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhbhhhhhhhhhhh baby

ySy8mcceTno,Creepy pasta universe bruh
ySy8mcceTno,i think everyone forgot about slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"Since the Slenderman creepy pasta was partly inspired by the Endermen from Minecraft, does this count as a Minecraft movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late there buddy
ySy8mcceTno,Thank Gaisus

ySy8mcceTno,So after this are we getting the fnaf movie
ySy8mcceTno,"Made by the same studio who brought you the emoji movie...
With all jokes aside, this looks good! Hopefully it brings the sprit if the games out on screen"
ySy8mcceTno,"The acting seems a little weird, and the directing is kinda weird from what I can tell."
ySy8mcceTno,"But the real question is, Will it be scarier than Marble Hornets?"
ySy8mcceTno,"You have your opinions, people, I won’t stop you. But what are you going to accomplish by doing this? You can’t make up people’s minds anyways, so what is the point?"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally slender man is coming out this year in 2018 I can’t fucking wait 😃😍🤪

ySy8mcceTno,I just wanna know why when she is writing on the glass it sounds like she’s writing on a chalkboard
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to have a fantastic influence on children

ySy8mcceTno,Okay clearly Sony paid YT to put this on trending.
ySy8mcceTno,I’m a wimp when it comes to horror and this didn’t even make me flinch
ySy8mcceTno,Definitely checking Rotten Tomatoes before I see this
ySy8mcceTno,"I like that it looks like they're taking a ""less is more"" aproach, but knowing this director's track record, this is probably going to be crap."
ySy8mcceTno,I didn’t need sleep anyways because this is pure DISTURBING
ySy8mcceTno,https://youtu.be/vzyZ8PCJRdw
ySy8mcceTno,Why? That's all I can say. Why?
ySy8mcceTno,The ring 4 looks good
ySy8mcceTno,Why are they making a movie on slenderman of all things.
ySy8mcceTno,So is this the new Venom movie?
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to see it
ySy8mcceTno,Wack
ySy8mcceTno,WTF did I just watch and I think thats a good thing...
ySy8mcceTno,All I saw in this was people killing them selves
ySy8mcceTno,I seriously thought the title said Spider Man....
ySy8mcceTno,Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Woo another outdated meme
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know how to judge this movie based on the trailer but I'm definitely going to check it out!
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like another trailer to RINGS but I'll still watch it
ySy8mcceTno,This is real?!?
ySy8mcceTno,John Cena is the only one who can play Slenderman.
ySy8mcceTno,11 years late to the party
ySy8mcceTno,yes.
ySy8mcceTno,Wannabe classic horror movie villians
ySy8mcceTno,I can wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,I thought the trailer was rather good it was mysterious and was suspenseful . Lets just hope the movie is as good as this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Too late for this
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, you have to fill the Worst Movies of 2018 list with something."
ySy8mcceTno,"Finally, there has been so much slender movies, and we're finally getting a theatrical release, looks interesting, can't wait"
ySy8mcceTno,*Se tiver algum BR ai se manifeste*
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim Well they don't really show him in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Thats not SlenderMan! Thats SONY taking your soul with all of their shitty remakes.
ySy8mcceTno,hells yeahhh
ySy8mcceTno,...
ySy8mcceTno,lol ok
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like the happening part 2....
ySy8mcceTno,Is it just me or is a lot of stuff right now is involving the woods somehow???
ySy8mcceTno,I swear to god Pewds or Mark should get a fucking cameo in this movie
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer ruim jesus...pqp ...bora v o filme neh
ySy8mcceTno,I used to Believe in slender man
ySy8mcceTno,"I wondered how long it would take them to make a movie about this. Wasn't this really popular like 6 years ago, though?"
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve mala así que de seguro será una buena película.
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like everyone is running out of ideas for horror movies here.... .-.
ySy8mcceTno,Another one eh? Doug Jones going to reprise the role of the Slenderman?
ySy8mcceTno,I just can't wait for #DeathHouse
ySy8mcceTno,"Doesn’t look
Like it will be good but Bout time they made a slender movie tho"
ySy8mcceTno,Here we go
ySy8mcceTno,this already looks messy
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok, the top 3 trending are about men in woods."
ySy8mcceTno,This does not look like how slender man is supposed to look like
ySy8mcceTno,Even the  fan made movies are better
ySy8mcceTno,Sorry your a little late
ySy8mcceTno,Please dont pay money to watch children being tortured
ySy8mcceTno,Omg!
ySy8mcceTno,He's back...
ySy8mcceTno,Cool concept. Underwhelming production I can already tell. It's a no for me.
ySy8mcceTno,Finally a movie based on a creepypasta. It's what we've all been waiting for
ySy8mcceTno,Y tho
ySy8mcceTno,*Please don't be another Oujia*
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets?
ySy8mcceTno,Ms.perigrinnes did it better
ySy8mcceTno,Good idea.... but too late
ySy8mcceTno,It's only about 8 years late.
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully Logan Paul doesn’t explore slender man forest probably gonna make fun of the slender man😈
ySy8mcceTno,"SJWs will be triggered. WHY NOT ""PLUS SIZE PERSON?"""
ySy8mcceTno,I thought this creepypasta died years ago
ySy8mcceTno,now we need one about the other creepypastas
ySy8mcceTno,My initial reaction: Meh
ySy8mcceTno,Way to copy stranger things.
ySy8mcceTno,Glad to see the black smoke from Lost finally getting more work.
ySy8mcceTno,Slender is at 1:40 from far
ySy8mcceTno,What came from a scary photo competition... To a Sony Movie...0.0
ySy8mcceTno,"Now you see if this was a porno it would be ""He gets in them panties, like a meme lord"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Who needs to see the movie, when the trailer shows 99.999999999 percent of it."
ySy8mcceTno,Just a trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,Let me see slenderman.-.
ySy8mcceTno,"Well,








Ok"
ySy8mcceTno,Please let this be good so other creepy pastas can be explored in future horror movies 🙏🏽
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff the killer next please
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm not sure about the insane, bizarre and Lovecraftian feel of the creepypastas translating well into a movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Where are the eight pages? Hmmmm🤔🤔🤔
ySy8mcceTno,hm.... i don't know
ySy8mcceTno,The #1 movie in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Is this for real can wait to see OT
ySy8mcceTno,I knew this was gonna happen at some point
ySy8mcceTno,Who else thinks they are trying to cash in on IT?
ySy8mcceTno,HELL YEAH
ySy8mcceTno,Nah fam
ySy8mcceTno,oh boy...
ySy8mcceTno,And that's why you don't go into the woods.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALMENTE ♥♥♥♥
ySy8mcceTno,Why
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer is way prettier than it has any right to be.
ySy8mcceTno,i would watch this if it was 4 years ago
ySy8mcceTno,"idc about the movie, but sony send me an a6000 and ill go see it."
ySy8mcceTno,Nope nope nope nope nope!!!
ySy8mcceTno,What. The. Hell.
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah no thanks
ySy8mcceTno,Stranger Things season 3 came so fast!
ySy8mcceTno,2012 me is excited!  I'll see it.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, Sony! You’re about 6 years too late!"
ySy8mcceTno,Just wait till they try to turn this into some creepypasta cinematic universe
ySy8mcceTno,I have a bad feeling about this
ySy8mcceTno,I’m not sure how I feel about this video having 666 dislikes....
ySy8mcceTno,IM TOO EXITED I DEMAND THIS TO COME OUT ALREADY
ySy8mcceTno,Not even five seconds in and I'm yelling OH HELL NO
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie might be good , bc the creator/ writer of slenderman helped with this project"
ySy8mcceTno,i expect a good idea with horrendous execution.
ySy8mcceTno,These are the same makers that made the emoji movie
ySy8mcceTno,I think is the same dorector to the Ring 2002
ySy8mcceTno,The jump scares in the original game is going to be way more scary then the movie
ySy8mcceTno,"I plan on checking this out. Please be a good horror movie, not just a flick with cheap jumpscares 😉"
ySy8mcceTno,6 years after the game they finally made a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman : ""Can you see him""
John Cena : ""You can see me"""
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman : ""Can you see him""
John Cena : ""You can see me"""
ySy8mcceTno,Where’s sonic
ySy8mcceTno,What a shitty sound... where's the old broken TV sound he makes when he grabs you ?
ySy8mcceTno,is it odd that I'm getting stranger things demagorgon/mind flyer vibes? like people are mysteriously going missing and the monster posseses them. Also the father  is looking for his daughter like how Joyce wanted Will back. Idk. It just reminding me of stranger things.
ySy8mcceTno,But did the they find the 8 pages
ySy8mcceTno,If this came out in 2012 you might've gotten me to see it.
ySy8mcceTno,This is going to be quite interesting...
ySy8mcceTno,Barley shows slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Pennywise- '' Teach me your technique...''
ySy8mcceTno,They're making a Slenderman movie?!
ySy8mcceTno,Oh God... Sony.... c’mon
ySy8mcceTno,It looks very cheap. 😕
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't this couple of yrs to late? It was popular in 2012 but been forgotten since then.
ySy8mcceTno,SCP Foundation next please.
ySy8mcceTno,goosebumps
ySy8mcceTno,"This would have been a really good thing in 2011. but now, I just hope it's good"
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for this i almost played all the games
ySy8mcceTno,"Ooh yey, this dude was everywhere back then."
ySy8mcceTno,Still waiting on the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie.
ySy8mcceTno,The game looks scarier
ySy8mcceTno,if the slenderman is barely in this we riot
ySy8mcceTno,Next jeff the killer :V
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm scared, not because of the movie, but about what Sony could do to it"
ySy8mcceTno,this looks soo bad
ySy8mcceTno,"Loved the spoilers and cliches, Sony.

Really striking while the iron's hot fellas."
ySy8mcceTno,"Okay, but when this movie come out yall better give slendy his 20 dollars"
ySy8mcceTno,I've seen fan trailers better than this.
ySy8mcceTno,i cant wait
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks mediocre
ySy8mcceTno,Ok
ySy8mcceTno,colisse que sa va etre bon
ySy8mcceTno,"Guaranteed, half of what you seen in the trailer isn't gonna be in the film. :/ He doesn't even have the traditional suit.


Watch it be PG-13 too"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hate to break it to you sony, but I think you are kinda late to the party. You know like 6 years late...


Or maybe it's just me idk lol. Give us the popeye movie"
ySy8mcceTno,We need origin story
ySy8mcceTno,"Hmmm... I’m interested but so far, I have two main complaints. 

1) Slender looks like the monster from Stranger Things, I feel like they could’ve done something a bit more creative with the design but I could be totally wrong.

2) This honestly looks a like a high production fan film than a serious movie."
ySy8mcceTno,"There is something that perplexes me.

You have a creepypasta story with interesting concept that became a meme online 6 years ago, so 6 years later you made a horror movie based on the character with jumpscares galore....

WHAT ARE THEY THINKING!?

At least it's not Fifty Shades.... Hopefully not...."
ySy8mcceTno,"So cool i saw in the 2018 movie by movieinsider
Did you know theres gonna be a predator movie if you excited like"
ySy8mcceTno,Generic😒
ySy8mcceTno,Can't waiiit
ySy8mcceTno,Que bosta
ySy8mcceTno,This feels disappointing.
ySy8mcceTno,Is this the same Slanderman from Metallica song?
ySy8mcceTno,What its been like three yrs since he became a huge internet sensation & now i finally get a movie? Lol it better be good ugh
ySy8mcceTno,RKO OUTTA NOWHERE
ySy8mcceTno,You guys are sexists!!! What about the Slender Women?!?!
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly this looks a lot different than I thought it was gonna be so hopefully that means it’s good *Hopefully*
ySy8mcceTno,"They didn't show a single page, finding the pages is the best part of the story."
ySy8mcceTno,Eh looks Corny
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks good but it not what we want from a slender man movie,so if this is what we waited for 6 years it better good😕"
ySy8mcceTno,im actually excited oh god
ySy8mcceTno,I feel like I just watched the video from the Ring.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow,I am speechless. This looks like its going to be taking the IT route (The book not the movie.) by showing the effects of slender man more than the actual monster itself. If you excuse me i'll be buying a quick ticket to the hype train. #CanYouSeeHim"
ySy8mcceTno,It doesn't really look that good.
ySy8mcceTno,Laughed and shook my head throughout the whole trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks horrible, watch Marble Hornets instead."
ySy8mcceTno,Sexy
ySy8mcceTno,Ya lo quiero ver!!!
ySy8mcceTno,looks like fun though
ySy8mcceTno,I was honestly hoping they'd take some elements from that incident where those 2 psycho chicks stabbed their friend in a forest.
ySy8mcceTno,What a weird time for this to come out... does anyone really care anymore?
ySy8mcceTno,wait i thought slender man targets children not teens and older
ySy8mcceTno,This movie should have came out 4 years ago when the Slender Man was relevant
ySy8mcceTno,man this looks like crap
ySy8mcceTno,This feels a couple years too late
ySy8mcceTno,OMG I can't wait to watch this.
ySy8mcceTno,"So they make a movie about slenderman because things involving ""him"" are causing serious stuff like those two girls who stab her best friend 19 times! This movie is gonna scare people and cause crazy stuff again...(sigh)😑"
ySy8mcceTno,Ohhh fucking trailer!
ySy8mcceTno,Valiente mierda
ySy8mcceTno,Okay actually looks better than I thought. Glad they didn’t show him in the trailer less is more in these cases.
ySy8mcceTno,A bit late...but I'll take it
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a mystery for Scooby and The Gang.
ySy8mcceTno,Wtf!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,lol this looks pretty trash
ySy8mcceTno,About 6 years to late Sony but nice try
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks almost like a fan made trailer. Its very unique that's all I'm gonna say. Also I am sold!
Edit: Scratch the whole unique stuff I just said, It just looks a lot like a Fan made trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,I will watch it tentatively
ySy8mcceTno,Nossa que bosta
ySy8mcceTno,rayos! ojala supiera canadiense :V
ySy8mcceTno,"slenderman is a ghoul, don't lie."
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender Man Slender Man all the children try to run

Slender Man Slender Man to him it's part of the fun

Slender Man Slender Man dressed in darkest suit and tie

Slender Man Slender Man you most certainly will die

Slender Man Slender Man sometimes hums a lonely drone

Slender Man Slender Man he will wander around your home 

Slender Man Slender Man blends in well within the trees

Slender Man Slender Man in the fog he's hard to see"
ySy8mcceTno,a little late don't you think?
ySy8mcceTno,From the publishers of the emoji movie....
ySy8mcceTno,Did they make him black or is that just the darkness? And I mean literally black. xD
ySy8mcceTno,I can die happy now...
ySy8mcceTno,Like si tienes muchas ganas de que salga ya la peli XD
ySy8mcceTno,Worst trailer ever! You can't even tell what its about. Even if you do know about Slender Man.
ySy8mcceTno,"#CanYouSeeHim no,i cant see slender bith"
ySy8mcceTno,This guy stopped being creepy ever since Deviantart got a hold of him... that lasted like 3 months.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hola, Sony? Habla el 2014, devuélveme mis creepypastas! >:v"
ySy8mcceTno,I have a very big doubt this is going to amount to much of anything. It's riding the coat-tails of an internet ghost story turned meme at this point.
ySy8mcceTno,Krlh q merda hein
ySy8mcceTno,This surprisingly looks good
ySy8mcceTno,Yeah this is perfectly timed. Definitely not an outdated thing... *HEAVY SARCASM*
ySy8mcceTno,Hopefully they go the Marble Hornets route of not showing him constantly and keeping him in the background.
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone think it said Spider-Man at first then get really confused.
ySy8mcceTno,Best movie of 2012
ySy8mcceTno,"Man this looks wack, what's up with the whole virus making ppl crazy thing it's been done before."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie it's very scary
ySy8mcceTno,This was released way to late. If this came out a couple years ago it would be much more popular
ySy8mcceTno,How do you do fellow kids?
ySy8mcceTno,I honestly don't know how I feel about this
ySy8mcceTno,bye bye man meets the babadock meets the Blair which?
ySy8mcceTno,"so like, what the plot?"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't trust Sony after that Emoji Movie fiasco...
ySy8mcceTno,I think this movie will be good
ySy8mcceTno,PLEASE DONT DO WHAT The Boy DID WHERE THE PLOT TWIST WAS IT WAS JUST SOME DUDE AND NOT A GHOST
ySy8mcceTno,finally a trailer that doesn't spoil the entire movie
ySy8mcceTno,If this is financially successful regardless of the quality it will open to floodgates for more creepypasta movies.
ySy8mcceTno,Y splendorman?🙃
ySy8mcceTno,What's next a abandoned by Disney found footage movie?
ySy8mcceTno,6 Years to late sony
ySy8mcceTno,Jeff The Killer >>>>
ySy8mcceTno,Wow this trailer SUCKS
ySy8mcceTno,"But... slender man is creepypasta, not scary pasta or even horrorpasta. 
Even so, the original demographic for this has moved on to other memes. If you want to be an edgy Hollywood producer, make a quick movie out of shitposts. That'll make billions of shekels."
ySy8mcceTno,I expected more views
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t be a possession horror cliche. Slender man is an abductor
ySy8mcceTno,Looking forward to this 👍🏻
ySy8mcceTno,It's about time i say
ySy8mcceTno,"Anybody here a fan of creepypasta....

BECAUSE I AM"
ySy8mcceTno,oh hell yes
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks interesting
ySy8mcceTno,Please don’t ruin The Legend of Horror games
ySy8mcceTno,AAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM SO EXCITED!!
ySy8mcceTno,"11 years late, Sony, everybody is disappointed of you."
ySy8mcceTno,I can't wait to see this
ySy8mcceTno,I was expecting a creepy movie and some kids finding the 8 pages so Slender Man can leave the kids alone. This is completely different I think they're going for more of a grim and terrifying movie. I like it cause this movie looks like it's gonna give people nightmares
ySy8mcceTno,"""Movies make me wanna be Dead""

ySy8mcceTno,"Não tem nada haver com o jogo, que decepção"
ySy8mcceTno,"Just a little late...





:|"
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok good 10/10 yes besto movie totally doesnt ruin the character


Also even better. Now all ARGs and Slender videos will be copyright blocked because now these kiddos think they own the character.

6 years that the fandom worked for the lore of this character gone to waste... KMS"
ySy8mcceTno,foda!!
ySy8mcceTno,Wheres Five Nights at Freddys Sony? HAHA XD XD
ySy8mcceTno,Azopotadre :v
ySy8mcceTno,"I actually want the Slender Vibe where when he is on camera, it goes static like what really happens if you have a camera near him"
ySy8mcceTno,Slendeeer!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Trailer was good up until the girl started screaming. Still going to give the movie a chance.
ySy8mcceTno,HELP ME IM DROWNING IN ROBLOX
ySy8mcceTno,UNITE AND REJOICE MY CREEPYPASTA FANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,I LIKE THE PART WHERE THE KID DABS
ySy8mcceTno,HELP
ySy8mcceTno,LOL NOT A GOOD MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,I DISLIKED THIS AND YOU SHOULD TOO!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"The trailer kinda lost me about two thirds in, still, maybe I’ll check it out if reviews are decent."
ySy8mcceTno,It's 2012 already?
ySy8mcceTno,GARLICK BREAD
ySy8mcceTno,"CAN'T WAIT FOR A GREAT VIDEO GAME MOVIE 
NOT"
ySy8mcceTno,Just stop screaming please!!!!!!!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,"This game scared me as a kid. I didn't even think he'd kill me though, I thought he'd come in my room and grab me and I didn't want to be held lmao."
ySy8mcceTno,CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SLENDERMAN RULE 34
ySy8mcceTno,I HATE THIIS
ySy8mcceTno,Holy Sh-t! It’s ACTUALLY HAPPENING! A video game HORROR movie?! TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,So are those quick montages of random maggots or other things going to be that sporadic in the final film? Its not creepy or scary and just makes this film appear a little amateurish from a technical standpoint.
ySy8mcceTno,ONLY 90S KIDS WILL SEE THIS
ySy8mcceTno,ONLY 2000S KIDS WILL REMEMBER THIS
ySy8mcceTno,L O L
ySy8mcceTno,this is  N  O T      G O O D
ySy8mcceTno,this video goes in the spank bank
ySy8mcceTno,Marble Hornets really upgraded their equipment.
ySy8mcceTno,Break the trend Slendy! Finally a good video game movie.
ySy8mcceTno,"I rate this trailer 5/10

Not enough static"
ySy8mcceTno,Sony: They make the movies nobody wants
ySy8mcceTno,Haven't people tried this before? And hasn't it all been awful?
ySy8mcceTno,So creepypastas are now getting films... 1999 the movie make it happen!!!
ySy8mcceTno,For those complaining don't because they didn't show enough to complain about this is just a teaser so not anything story related just wait for a better trailer
ySy8mcceTno,2012 dicen que si eres tan amable de devolverle a su creepypasta sobre explotada
ySy8mcceTno,Boooooooo!
ySy8mcceTno,"This doesn't look like a Slenderman based story, the plot looks off, and the writer's should look up the wiki of Slenderman, read about the frictional character, learn more about Marble Hornets. I dont think this movies gonna mirror the exact replica of Slenderman. They are just going to kill the Slenderman franchise."
ySy8mcceTno,In b4 a million
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it's gonna suck but it was filmed in my home town so I'll watch it
ySy8mcceTno,Sony you have a Film that might be bad but it’s going to be a surprisedly great one  (Peter Rabbit) and you bring out something unexpected And people are looking forward to it (which is Slender Man) (I think I found the same pattern as Sony’s last year with a bad one like the emoji movie and the good film like Jumanji:welcome to the jungle)
ySy8mcceTno,I don't know how to feel about this.
ySy8mcceTno,Ah slender man movie!? OH BOI! I WILL SEE IT FOR SURE!
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought slender man wore a suit, wtf is this bullshit sony 😅😅 #TRYAGAIN #STARTOVER"
ySy8mcceTno,won't be as good as marble hornets
ySy8mcceTno,"Part Two of the ""Meme Cinematic Universe"" by Sony, following The Emoji Movie."
ySy8mcceTno,So Slender Man is Groot now?
ySy8mcceTno,Sony should just give the rights back to marvel. Oh wait...
ySy8mcceTno,I'm feeling hype for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,"A lot of people are saying, less is more don’t show slender, but the thing I liked most about Marble Hornets was that slender was in a lot of shots but you would only notice if you weren’t paying attention to the characters and dialogue and we’re actively looking for him. I want a lot of that! I wanna watch the movie and be like, “Is that him in the background!” “Did that branch just move!? Is it his arm!?”"
ySy8mcceTno,Y después la película de sus hermanos wuuuu ok no :v
ySy8mcceTno,What a boring trailer. Where's the story? It looks like a lot of young schizophrenics. Very annoying.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY !!!
ySy8mcceTno,This will be a amazing film but if slender is in it for 5 min it's gonna be a so bad but hopefully it's gonna get it right n it will be amazing
ySy8mcceTno,"Where’s Jay, Alex, and Tim?"
ySy8mcceTno,Slender man more like ENDERMAN
ySy8mcceTno,The long awaited movie! The trailer is finally here! Please don’t be garbage like The Star was!
ySy8mcceTno,looks nothing like what the original creepy pasta was about
ySy8mcceTno,If he ain't in the snazziest suit the world has ever seen then what the fucking point?
ySy8mcceTno,Don't care if movie is bad or good. Don't care what people say in the comments. I am going to follow this movie and watch it. Because I want to.
ySy8mcceTno,"I realize this movie is probably just going to be another mediocre-at-best cash grab, but Slender was a huge part of me growing up as little kid. I really hope this movie doesn't ruin it."
ySy8mcceTno,Trash
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks very low budget and bland. It’s trying to do what IT did last year, but at least in that film, they had a bit of fun with it. This is screaming “PLEASE TAKE ME SERIOUSLY”. Only positive is that the actual Slender guy looks proper scary, but I can already tell it’s gonna take backseat to jump scares and shock."
ySy8mcceTno,fuckin terrifying
ySy8mcceTno,"Next year:
*Pennywise v Slender Man : Dawn of Fear*"
ySy8mcceTno,"The slenderman topic died after PewDiePie and other big YTers stopped playing Slenderman when like 6 years ago? However, I always wanted it to be as a movie so i'm curious to see what it's like. It better be good too."
ySy8mcceTno,?
ySy8mcceTno,IN THE PAST SONY TRIUMPH WITH SPIDERMAN AND IN THE FUTURE THE CAGARA WITH SLENDERMAN FRIENDS
ySy8mcceTno,Slendermanın filmi çıktı hemen kaçmalıyım (öldürdüm) yiğit alp cavdar kospilav
ySy8mcceTno,"No tengo muchas eaperanzas en esto la verdad, pero espero que valga la pena"
ySy8mcceTno,"Woooohoooo 
returns my favorite creepypasta  beeeeetch yyaaaaayy!!!!!"
ySy8mcceTno,to late sony
ySy8mcceTno,Why make a slender man movie if you'll have to make a story for it better off just making a movie about a game that already comes with a story
ySy8mcceTno,No lo se Ricardo parece trucho
ySy8mcceTno,It's one of those movies where u don't see the monster till like the ending and a couple seconds inbetween the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Pleasedontruinitpleasedontruinitpleasedontruinit
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh man, I'm definitely watching this movie if it's not rated r"
ySy8mcceTno,Please please please be good I want to love this movie
ySy8mcceTno,now i just want to watch hornets.  anyone else
ySy8mcceTno,"For people confused on the slender man not appeared,he appeared near the end of the trailer which is 1:52,Happy?"
ySy8mcceTno,why this movie is called slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,"85% - negative comments >:) 
10% - other stuff :-| 
5% - positive comments :-)"
ySy8mcceTno,They made him a mental illness smh he could've been a great horror character
ySy8mcceTno,Looks pretty good. Hopefully it'll be as good or better than Always Watching.
ySy8mcceTno,"Not 100% confident in this movie yet, but exited nonetheless."
ySy8mcceTno,The Ring 4?
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks incredibly lame tbh...I hope I'm wrong though.

Btw anyone wanting something good based on creepypasta check out Channel Zero. Good tv show."
ySy8mcceTno,"I seriously try not to be negative because usually I’m not towards a movie, but try watching this trailer without knowing that it’s a slender man movie and you just get confused like, what the hell is this"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks silly
ySy8mcceTno,omg omg omg omg
ySy8mcceTno,why.... why does this look good.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks bloody awful!
ySy8mcceTno,The music is so creepy
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow a Slenderman movie, what's next, a Jeff the Killer movie?"
ySy8mcceTno,This either could be really good or really really bad
ySy8mcceTno,It’s just a sneak peak that’s why it looks sucky one reason is because they haven’t even determined a release date or age rating
ySy8mcceTno,I was expecting literal garbage from this but this actually seems like it’s going to be extremely suspenseful and twisted and I’m totally here for it.
ySy8mcceTno,hermoso
ySy8mcceTno,Just watch Marble Hornets guys
ySy8mcceTno,Has a sinister feel to it. Lets go.
ySy8mcceTno,You probably won’t see slendy that much in the movie because he can’t hurt anyone if they don’t see him
ySy8mcceTno,Oigan falto el loquendo >:v
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm looking forward to this movie, hope to see it soon"
ySy8mcceTno,This should more about the background of slender man rather than just slender man being picked out of many to just kill
ySy8mcceTno,Markiplier has to react to this
ySy8mcceTno,its about time  they made a movie on slender man
ySy8mcceTno,Ugh
ySy8mcceTno,..................? That was a horrible trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,2:02 laughing crazy baby from the PS3 commercials? Is that you?
ySy8mcceTno,Ummmmm... No....
ySy8mcceTno,CADE O TERNO ??
ySy8mcceTno,CADE O TERNO CARA PELO AMOR
ySy8mcceTno,"I can't wait for this to come out and make money regardless of its actual quality, which is probably very low effort. #slindarmenxDlolfunnysoscary"
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer makes it look like the movie is going to be trying way to hard to be something more than what it really is.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years late on this Sony.
ySy8mcceTno,Vai ser muito loco 🤔😍
ySy8mcceTno,I'm interested in it!!!! I love creepy
ySy8mcceTno,i like how they didn't show slender man too much so when we watch the movie and be unprepared......yeah its totally gonna leave a big face on you....I think
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like garbage
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like it could be a good Psychological Horror. But the way Studios are it might just be another Jumpscare galore. I’ll wait for reviews
ySy8mcceTno,wow undoomed is making really good intros lately
ySy8mcceTno,">Sony
>PG13"
ySy8mcceTno,This looks suprisingly good
ySy8mcceTno,"6 years later... 
Finaly Slender Man Official movie"
ySy8mcceTno,"It bums me out that all the negative comments are just edgy people who are just shiting on slender man, if they were bashing on sony id get it but this movie could be good, its a good ip and i hope they do it well"
ySy8mcceTno,This shouldive been a thing years ago.  and even THEN this shouldn’t be a thing
ySy8mcceTno,Parece ruim
ySy8mcceTno,Omg this looks so amazing. Thank you sony
ySy8mcceTno,Did anyone else think this was a joke when they saw the poster?
ySy8mcceTno,so many similar aspects to the ring
ySy8mcceTno,"Jeff the killer
Jane the killer
Jeff the killer vs Jane the killer
Slenderman vs Jeff  the killer 

Coming soon"
ySy8mcceTno,Unfortunate most people aren’t familiar with lovecraftian horror. Then they’d understand the lack of appearance of slender man. This isn’t a slasher movie
ySy8mcceTno,This is not tasteless at allllll...
ySy8mcceTno,This trailer gives off The Ring kinda vibe. Like the atmosphere feels similar to The Ring movie
ySy8mcceTno,horror of the year already🤔
ySy8mcceTno,A creepypasta story comes to the cinema i am so exited!
ySy8mcceTno,Geez if only this was made in 2013!
ySy8mcceTno,like 8 years late but ok
ySy8mcceTno,what has the world come to
ySy8mcceTno,Honestly this trailer doesn't say Slenderman to me. I wonder if they even explored the lore of Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,all those 2010 gamers must be very happy
ySy8mcceTno,"Not enough to judge the movie just yet. The two word that captures the essence of what Slenderman is dread and despair. You can't escape it forever. The more you know about it, the worse it gets in your head, and the more aggressive it gets."
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouFeelThe2012?
ySy8mcceTno,Up next cuz sony is out of idea's jeff the killer the movie
ySy8mcceTno,Lol. Just watched the trailer for truth or dare. It also has someone plunging a sharp object into their eye. So stupid.
ySy8mcceTno,Horrible
ySy8mcceTno,"The beginning of the trailer was pretty solid, then it became a discount version of the ring. All you needed was a search group and police in the woods looking for someone than being hunted by the slender man. This looks needlessly complicated."
ySy8mcceTno,Why doesnt he wear the suit wtf
ySy8mcceTno,What for fnaf movie ?
ySy8mcceTno,They’re going to neglect the slenderverse in this movie aren’t they? The visuals are nice but where’s the true narration it has some ties to the game but the random child laughter is oddly put where it shouldn’t
ySy8mcceTno,"Welp, this is gonna suck"
ySy8mcceTno,They shouldn't put this out. Because when they see this movie they will hurt someone
ySy8mcceTno,Gonna Be Dope From Me XD
ySy8mcceTno,Creepypasta Cinematic Universe?! DO IT SONY OR BE DELETED!!!!
ySy8mcceTno,So yeah I don't think this is going to be a good movie. Seems like a cashgrab that's just a bit too late.
ySy8mcceTno,We all knew this would happen
ySy8mcceTno,How like wow it was just a game now a MOVIE
ySy8mcceTno,...not sure it's a good idea...considering what happened with the stabbing and all...
ySy8mcceTno,This is like a collage of images and sounds. What smattering of crap did I just watch?
ySy8mcceTno,Boy I sure hope this isn't a bunch of girls screaming and running alone and the police taking action at the very end when everyone is already dead
ySy8mcceTno,Se ve de la mierda :v
ySy8mcceTno,I actually kinda wanna see this.
ySy8mcceTno,When you revive shitpost from 2011
ySy8mcceTno,Looks well shot at least
ySy8mcceTno,"I feel like it should be kids fighting slenderman...


I felt like a slenderman movie would work if it was like IT, Kids fighting Slender"
ySy8mcceTno,And Jeff?
ySy8mcceTno,mmm 7/10
ySy8mcceTno,Should have based it more off of the marble hornets series
ySy8mcceTno,YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY XDDDDDDDDDDDDD HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAhAHA SXARDEATH KINGSFIREEE
ySy8mcceTno,There’s already a slender man movie.... it’s called marblehornets
ySy8mcceTno,People wanted this a long time ago and now it's too late nobody likes slender man anymore.
ySy8mcceTno,ツ
ySy8mcceTno,Solo falta la de Jeff the killer
ySy8mcceTno,kk q bomba
ySy8mcceTno,"what the, where the suit of slenderman? slenderman is gentle man"
ySy8mcceTno,needs more sound effects
ySy8mcceTno,uhhhhhu! finalmente porra!  karalho!
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to go see this movie. I will enjoy it cause they are finally making a movie about Creepypastas. I've been waiting a long time for this😁🔪
ySy8mcceTno,"This actually looks pretty good , even if it's not totally like the game. You can't expect it to totally follow the story to the game cause there really isn't one besides finding notes and try not to look at him"
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like the cast is doing a pretty good job imo
ySy8mcceTno,"Aren't you guys a lil late for this, you might as well think of the possibility for a Dead David movie"
ySy8mcceTno,I want to kill myself.
ySy8mcceTno,FINALLY.
ySy8mcceTno,Or you could watch Marble Hornets like everybody else.
ySy8mcceTno,weeeena
ySy8mcceTno,"Youre years wayyyy too late here, Sony..."
ySy8mcceTno,YOU'RE TOO LATE SONY. THE SLENDERMAN TREND WAS DEAD SINCE 2012.
ySy8mcceTno,SUCKS ! STOP USING CHEAP JUMP SCARE AND SOUND TO SALE A FUCKING MOVIE !
ySy8mcceTno,Sony doesn’t know how to make good movies anymore and this was a trend from years ago so NO. I won’t waste my time or money with this
ySy8mcceTno,"Color timing is not scary. Sound effects are not scary. Crazy editing is not scary. Modern horror is not scary and this probably won't be, either."
ySy8mcceTno,"It looks more like an alien hunting the people, I hope it's not as bad as Call of duty Black Ops 3 Story..."
ySy8mcceTno,Finally there's a movie we have been waiting
ySy8mcceTno,SPOILER ALERT: This movie is going to suck!
ySy8mcceTno,"John Cena must be slender man








Cus you can’t see him."
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait to see what other internet trends Sony decides to turn into terrible movies. When's the Pepe movie coming out? Gotta strike while the iron's still cold.
ySy8mcceTno,YES THANK YOUUUUU
ySy8mcceTno,Nothing remotely slender was seen
ySy8mcceTno,what next? slender Man vs Jeff the killer?
ySy8mcceTno,The trailer is mostly about a girl. Where is Slenderman besides in only one scene?
ySy8mcceTno,My favourite part of the trailer was 2:39.
ySy8mcceTno,1:32 hunger games rue alternate death scene xdxdxdxdxd
ySy8mcceTno,I liked Truth or Dare better
ySy8mcceTno,putting disturbing images is not scary... they are often disgusting not scary.
ySy8mcceTno,nice meme
ySy8mcceTno,Blair Witch 2016 + The Ring????
ySy8mcceTno,Also I have a sneaking suspicion the girl at the end is gonna be a proxy.
ySy8mcceTno,Nah I'd rather watch another Slender playthrough with Pewdiepie
ySy8mcceTno,Movie took way to long to come out. Should of came out 5 years ago when the hype was real.
ySy8mcceTno,Bosta de trailer kkkk
ySy8mcceTno,Imagine his tentacles hitting your g spot omg orgasm the house gurl
ySy8mcceTno,0:43 look at all that Deviant Art
ySy8mcceTno,Looks really good! Gonna watch it maybe.
ySy8mcceTno,Very bad edited. That's not how you make a trailer
ySy8mcceTno,"Un trailer que no le veo la gran cosa, parece que más un fan trailer, pero bueno le tengo pocas espectativas pero haber si cuando la vaya a ver me quité esas pocas expectativas"
ySy8mcceTno,Here before pewdiepie :^)
ySy8mcceTno,Average!
ySy8mcceTno,Ok. WHY ISNT THIS TRENDING???
ySy8mcceTno,Wow six years late this was popular back in 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Blunder man
ySy8mcceTno,"Some people are complaining about Slender Man not appearing very much in this. GOOD. I hope it stays that way, even in the movie. Go the less-is-more route. Show him as little as possible. That way, when he does appear, it will have the impact it should. Subtlety is key here. The horror of Slender Man comes from the other-worldly, surreal nature. It's not in your face jumpscares, it's looking at a seemingly normal picture and noticing him. Watching a scene from a video again and realizing he was in the background the entire time. That's the scary part. If they can nail that, they've got this."
ySy8mcceTno,rated r?
ySy8mcceTno,It looks amazing ❤😍
ySy8mcceTno,Did they just show me the whole movie? Welp it looks like someone needs better editors in my opinion; but at least it wasn't as bad as that Batman vs Superman second trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,"Are future horror films trying to copy IT? If they are, they are bound to fail"
ySy8mcceTno,No Mameeeeees! 😱😱😱💖
ySy8mcceTno,A trailer is supposed to make me want to see the movie not make me think that the trailer was made bad
ySy8mcceTno,When you're me and you're part of the CreepyPasta fandom but you're not sure if you want to watch it cause it might be really good or really fucking cringy...
ySy8mcceTno,WHEN USB the movie coming out
ySy8mcceTno,I remember the first time I made a movie.
ySy8mcceTno,#whereishenow
ySy8mcceTno,Who’s watching this in 2020?
ySy8mcceTno,"No Story yet ? Not a bad thing, it keeps its surprises for moviegowers. However this really looks like a bunch of jumpscare one after the other without real tension. Even tought this 1:38 is an interresting shot, but I really hope it doesn't go the way it's shown here."
ySy8mcceTno,"A trailer that shows entirely too much (with none of it being interesting). That's a first... 

And for the record, ""people just disappear"" all the time! 

4/10. Book it."
ySy8mcceTno,"A movie about Slender Man, except there is no Slender Man."
ySy8mcceTno,Such potential...but you know they're gonna eff it up. :(
ySy8mcceTno,"1:51
https://youtu.be/4p6dkMIEOfw"
ySy8mcceTno,What a horrible trailer
ySy8mcceTno,Is this on the murders or the actual slender man legend
ySy8mcceTno,Will it be in Hungarian?
ySy8mcceTno,"OMG CAN'T WAIT! I WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE


Ps: Was that Kate?
Ps 2: Is this Rated R?"
ySy8mcceTno,Ok then now there’s 2 slender man movies out
ySy8mcceTno,"Where's the ""Haha"" button in YT when you need it?"
ySy8mcceTno,No way this will be as good as the one that was (reportedly) being made before those girls killed their friend would have been. We're never gonna get to see it now though. R.I.P.
ySy8mcceTno,"just when you thought Sony couldn't make a movie just as worse as the emoji movie
🖕🏻🖕🏻this movie
🖕🏻🖕🏻you Sony
this movie movie will inspire more cults thus more murders"
ySy8mcceTno,I'm getting serious The Ring vibes
ySy8mcceTno,Se quedaron en 2012 o que pedo? :v
ySy8mcceTno,Or you could watch Marble Hornets or EverymanHybrid or Darkharvest0 or TribeTwelve for free and get better story / characters
ySy8mcceTno,YİĞİT ABİ KOŞ!
ySy8mcceTno,the emoji movie of 2018
ySy8mcceTno,"Used to really like the games in middle school and like freshman year. When I heard about the movie I got excited, now I'm just disappointed. It doesn't look good, it just looks like your average, typical, run of the mills, nothing special ""horror"" movie."
ySy8mcceTno,These looks like it's only going to be on DVD
ySy8mcceTno,They should have done a semi-documentary type movie based off of the real life killings in my opinion.
ySy8mcceTno,you're 10 years late
ySy8mcceTno,*$ony back at it again on the cash-grab*
ySy8mcceTno,Creppy-verse :v
ySy8mcceTno,It actually looks kinda decent.
ySy8mcceTno,"Trash, but I will watch this movie."
ySy8mcceTno,Someone call Sam and Dean.
ySy8mcceTno,Since Sony made this I'm a bit critical
ySy8mcceTno,"well this would have been so much better like 4 years ago but still, it looks ... interesting"
ySy8mcceTno,"Hoping this movie goes the “Alien” route and doesn’t show Slenderman too much. You gotta build up that suspense! It does look promising though, I’m not gonna lie"
ySy8mcceTno,"C mamo
C mamut
C lender man"
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated horror film of 2011 is finally coming!
ySy8mcceTno,Where is the stubley?
ySy8mcceTno,😳😳😳😱
ySy8mcceTno,Holy shiz
ySy8mcceTno,looking forward to this
ySy8mcceTno,Glad it's happening but somthing doesn't seem right. Maybe because it didn't freak me out or it just looks like a typically horror.
ySy8mcceTno,"Nothing will ever beat Marble Hornets story wise and in how Slenderman Lore was, I have hopes for this movie despite some of the things not being 100% accurate to the original Slenderman Lore, but considering it was made by Sony, I am expecting low, but high at the same time since this was probably the most popular creepypasta of all time"
ySy8mcceTno,Já vi adolescente polonês fazer filme mais assustador.
ySy8mcceTno,This just feels like they re-wrote Bye Bye Man and made him Slender Man instead.
ySy8mcceTno,5 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Where the hell did this movie come from?!
ySy8mcceTno,ooohh wow im scared...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks alright! Fingers crossed!
ySy8mcceTno,...Hmmmmm. I... am worried about this. Mostly bc it’s made from Sony tho. This better not be just a cash grab.
ySy8mcceTno,"Hey, I didn't know that Slender Man was in the same universe as ""The Ring"""
ySy8mcceTno,I am never going to watch nonsense and this is nonsense
ySy8mcceTno,They better not screw this up
ySy8mcceTno,Your like 4 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,"Well, this looks like it's going to suck."
ySy8mcceTno,1:38 is the only thing worth while in this trailer
ySy8mcceTno,TRASHHH
ySy8mcceTno,Haha just when Logan Paul made a video about a dead due
ySy8mcceTno,Llegas tarde... 5 años tarde >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Im guessing they ran out of ideas for a movie
ySy8mcceTno,why tf wasn’t it just based off of the video games....
ySy8mcceTno,They turned slenderman into a joke...
ySy8mcceTno,For this to be good: They should not explain Slenderman. They should not give him an originThey should reference the eight pages.They should not base the movie around eight pages.
ySy8mcceTno,Meh slender Man was always lame to me.
ySy8mcceTno,Mmmmm el trailer me dejo emocionado pero a la misma ves despcionado me hubiera gustado pero un poco mas el diseño de slenderman y bueno ojala tenga una buena trama y no arruinen un personaje que en sus tiempos daba miedo
ySy8mcceTno,still looks better than star wars ep.8
ySy8mcceTno,What’s next? Emily wants to play?
ySy8mcceTno,Que genial se vio ese trailer aunque slender man tuva poco tiempo en el trailer pero igual se ve bien 👍👍👍👍👍👍
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê os br?
ySy8mcceTno,yup...2018 is gonna be horrible
ySy8mcceTno,Pewdiepie should check this out
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated film of 2011
ySy8mcceTno,you think there’d be an actual Slenderman in a Slenderman trailer.   WTF?  This looks a knock off of THE RING.
ySy8mcceTno,"Here in Wisconsin there are two girls currently being sentenced to a mental hospital for stabbing their friend, and blaming it on slender man. The fact that this movie was made after that is disgusting and sony should be ashamed."
ySy8mcceTno,This was inevitable to happen and it’s destined to suck...
ySy8mcceTno,Finally we are getting a slender man movie but then what is next a Jeff the killer movie.
ySy8mcceTno,Isn't a little late for this? Slender Man hasn't been a thing since 2012
ySy8mcceTno,Where is venom ? Next trailer come on venom 
ySy8mcceTno,"Must watch, and I am not even the biggest Slenderfan."
ySy8mcceTno,This movie looks and sounds  retarded they need something that is more scary because some of us know slender man isn't real😐
ySy8mcceTno,Someone can explan WTF is this??????
ySy8mcceTno,This looks good!
ySy8mcceTno,T H E H Y P E
ySy8mcceTno,Is the movie going to have the protagonist collect eight pages? XD
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys slender man died in 2015. Maybe if this had come out then I would have been hype. Now it’s a fucking joke. Plus, it’s clear somebody at Sony just watched Tribe Twelve and took some of their dialogue and ideas. Seriously guys. This is gonna flop."
ySy8mcceTno,they are probably going to replace it with the figet spinner movie
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Welcome to family son
ySy8mcceTno,"B O I
A SLENDERMAN MOVIE!?"
ySy8mcceTno,"sony ... slenderman is not trend since 2013 this idea could have potential back then, but now this will only scare the high school kids who think it's scary because it has screamers"
ySy8mcceTno,#CanYouSeeHim
ySy8mcceTno,Anyone else worried that this is gonna suck?
ySy8mcceTno,"2012 called, they want their movie back"
ySy8mcceTno,I WANT TO SEE IT
ySy8mcceTno,I was trying to click on lego call of duty what da heck
ySy8mcceTno,If this came out 4-5 years ago it would have made bank but I’m glad it’s still being made
ySy8mcceTno,"I like Slender Man, but I’m surprised that they’re making about him, especially since what happened back with the Wisconsin Slender Stabbings"
ySy8mcceTno,Yay
ySy8mcceTno,"As long as he has the suit and white face, it'll be great!"
ySy8mcceTno,That makes TWO Sony movies I’m dying to see this year.
ySy8mcceTno,YES SLENDERMAN GETS HIS OWN MOVIE!!
ySy8mcceTno,"I thought this is fake, but I think it is going to be good movie"
ySy8mcceTno,Know you guys won't believe this but Just an hour ago I tried to find the trailer of this  movie but as you know there were only fan made trailer but how could this happen why does this channel uploaded the official trailer today or like just an hour after my search I mean i think i am A guy who can sense some future uploads on YouTube cheers
ySy8mcceTno,Não gostei
ySy8mcceTno,Still not gonna be better than the original game or the arrival
ySy8mcceTno,Are we going to see the proxys lol?
ySy8mcceTno,AHAHAHHAAH Slenderman
ySy8mcceTno,scary stuff
ySy8mcceTno,When you want to stab your best friend for slender man...(get ready for backlash).
ySy8mcceTno,Sérieuxxxxxxxxx
ySy8mcceTno,看着挺可怕，小时候有听过无面人的传说，会在窗口偷看你
ySy8mcceTno,**In Count Dooku voice** I've been waiting for this...
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like it could go both ways.  Either it could be a very good horror movie or a very bad one filled with tons of cliches.  I like how the trailer is vague and doesn’t reveal too much as proper trailers and proper horror movies should do.  However my biggest turn away is that the movie is being made by Sony.  So I’m interested for sure but I’m not getting my hopes up too much.
ySy8mcceTno,"I'm going to completely honest, I forgot this movie was being made. It didn't help that the Slender Man knockoff films came out before this film (The Tall Man, the Bye Bye Man, the Midnight Man)."
ySy8mcceTno,The most anticipated film of 2011.
ySy8mcceTno,It’s just about horror movie
ySy8mcceTno,I feel sick save me
ySy8mcceTno,6 years too late.
ySy8mcceTno,I have faith in Sony again
ySy8mcceTno,This is gonna be a bad movie I feel it
ySy8mcceTno,"Looks very meh and if this ends up being ""PG-13"" then its going to be bad for sure this movie has to be R in order to be a good horror movie. I think this movie is trying to get some of the IT hype I mean they have similarities to each other a mysterious dark force killing children to consume their soul in some way. I'm not saying they are exactly the same but to say they don't have anything in common is also a lie. I'm hoping this is good but this really needs to be a R rated gritty film and not hold back."
ySy8mcceTno,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa adorei
ySy8mcceTno,Remember when Slender man was popular back in 2012? I member.
ySy8mcceTno,"Pros:
They don't show Slender Man too much, which helps add to the fear as well as keeping in line with the game Slender to avoid looking at him.

Cons:
Too much Ring-like imagery that it gets distracting. I can see some people might get confused and think it's another Ring film."
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man vs Carnage..
ySy8mcceTno,Omg this movie is going to be amazing 2018 is gonna be the best year ever
ySy8mcceTno,my ears are hurting
ySy8mcceTno,"Guys, where is the Slender?"
ySy8mcceTno,Fora de timing e bem bosta
ySy8mcceTno,finally
ySy8mcceTno,"The movie ""Always Watching"" seems like a more faithful adaptation but this could be good. Hopefully."
ySy8mcceTno,"Eu esperei esse filme por um tempinho kkk 

( Algum br aqui ??? )

Brazilian ???"
ySy8mcceTno,"Sony, you're kinda six years late with this movie, sorry."
ySy8mcceTno,4 years after the hype is over.
ySy8mcceTno,Wow Loved it😍😍😍 👏big fan of horror movies😍😍
ySy8mcceTno,"What is she holding in her hands?
Reply with the correct answer to stand a chance of winning a PUBG loot crate."
ySy8mcceTno,Is this man from Marvel or DC?
ySy8mcceTno,Si esto aparece en la grasa paso pack de llef t quyler ;v
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, they finally did it. Hopefully, it doesn't suck."
ySy8mcceTno,Soooo creepy...
ySy8mcceTno,"This is so sloppy, why does it look like a fan film"
ySy8mcceTno,Hmm legend
ySy8mcceTno,"As much as I actually like the character, how much do you want to bet that the movie is only going to have him show up for 2% of the film while the rest is going to be these teens having seizures about him or other things. Typically that’s what happens with films like these. Still going to definitely watch it, even if it’s five years late and it turns out to be crap."
ySy8mcceTno,No vi a sleder
ySy8mcceTno,Even tho it's shitty I'm still watching this.
ySy8mcceTno,"Have been waiting for this movie for soooooooo looonnng! I love it, I love creepy stuff"
ySy8mcceTno,Wohh wohh wohh!! I’ve played this game & this game is super creepy & scary & I like it!! Now I’m hoping the movie Slender Man!! can scare me!! Excited to watch Slender Man movie!!✌️😈👍

ySy8mcceTno,Really nigga ?
ySy8mcceTno,trash ..lets wait for the second trailer though....
ySy8mcceTno,carnage
ySy8mcceTno,I'm officially creeped out now
ySy8mcceTno,Why is the video quality so bad? Looks like it has been re-encoded multiple times. Ugh.
ySy8mcceTno,아이썅 무섭자너
ySy8mcceTno,Yep. Hollywood's out of ideas.
ySy8mcceTno,6 years later
ySy8mcceTno,Slender Man has the chance to join the greatest horror characters in Cinema like Jason and Freddy Krueger if they get it right so I hope they get it right.
ySy8mcceTno,Looks like crap
ySy8mcceTno,I predict a maximum of 10 minutes of screen time for Slendy.
ySy8mcceTno,well...this looks kinda shitty.
ySy8mcceTno,Who read like spider man?
ySy8mcceTno,Im so excited for this movie
ySy8mcceTno,mal sabor de boca :/
ySy8mcceTno,"I doubt its going to be spectacular. But honestly, its been a long time coming. 
Sure, ill watch it."
ySy8mcceTno,AWESOME!!!
ySy8mcceTno,Who will watch this movie?
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like trash. I can only hope Lotax is a part of the inevitable  rifftrax
ySy8mcceTno,Watch this get #1 on trending
ySy8mcceTno,1:50 1 second before the best scene
ySy8mcceTno,Why am i watching this when i hate horror films. But sp00ky
ySy8mcceTno,Alert Tyrone Magnus.
ySy8mcceTno,Yiğit abim oynuyor mu filmde? .d
ySy8mcceTno,this feels more like a movie copying the ring effects. the fun thing about slender man was not maggots and scary things it was slender man himself.
ySy8mcceTno,Boring
ySy8mcceTno,Logan Paul shouldn't exis....oops wrong video!
ySy8mcceTno,Please no!
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh my god, an actual official trailer."
ySy8mcceTno,:v
ySy8mcceTno,"Oh man, this looks AMAZING! Totally going to be the first good game movie!!! *sarcasim"
ySy8mcceTno,"Slenderman no tiene canon oficial, no copyright sin derechos de autor. Nació en las redes sociales, se formó y recreó en ellas."
ySy8mcceTno,Too boring
ySy8mcceTno,wait slender man is the girl from the ring ? i mean i remember him just standing and not doing anything
ySy8mcceTno,Tengo que ver esta película
ySy8mcceTno,I expected this in 2013..... better late then never I guess.
ySy8mcceTno,Sin comentarios :v
ySy8mcceTno,Idk this looks like jump scare trash. Would have been cooler had they done some sort of weird fictionalized version of the actual Slender Man Murder case.
ySy8mcceTno,"Wow, this actually looks not terrible."
ySy8mcceTno,Si esto sale en la grasa paso los nudes de una grasosa deliciosa ;v
ySy8mcceTno,really sony ? a slender man movie? i get it if it was 2009/2010 when he was popular but  in 2018 ?
ySy8mcceTno,Llegaste tarde....15 años tarde >:v
ySy8mcceTno,Oh hell no! There making a Slender Man movie?! I hate that game! It should have been banned a long time ago! What’s next? A Five Nights at Freddy’s movie?!
ySy8mcceTno,I thought it was a spider Man trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,"*Oh boi, time to get the creepypasta back on track*"
ySy8mcceTno,Can't wait for the Lavender Town Horror movie.
ySy8mcceTno,No entendi ni un carajo :v
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks ridiculous. Seems cliche as hell, relying on weird CG and the cinematography looks horrible. Then again I guess the teenagers are stupid enough to eat this up so have it."
ySy8mcceTno,"I was so hype for this...
Well gonna play Slender: The Eight Pages and Slender: The Arrival"
ySy8mcceTno,This movie deserves a good production company. 😕
ySy8mcceTno,"It has many similarities with ""The Ring"", right?"
ySy8mcceTno,Lol
ySy8mcceTno,Cadê As 8 Páginas?
ySy8mcceTno,"bueno......... después de años recien sale su pelicula  -_- !
me hubiera gustado que hubiera salio por 2013 o 2014
cuando los crepypasta estaban en su mejor epoca(2011 AL 2014) ya que actualmente ya no son NADA 

bueno slenderman tiene varias crepypasta sobre su origen creado por fanaticos

pero creo que hay 3 o 2 que son mas conocidos por los fan de los crepypasta, creo que era uno de un demonio y la otra de un experimento fallido de un chico(84-B), no me acuerdo la otra.

SOLO ESPERO QUE LA ESENCIA DEL PERSONAJE DEL CREPYPASTA Y UNA PARTE DEL VIDEOJUEGO ESTE AHO

eso si tengo miedo que la pelicula se pase una película llena de gore sin una historia
EN ESPECIALMENTE, si la pelicula se va a basa en el caso de las niñas en la vida real,en las que arruinaron a los crepypasta y le dieron mala vista a esa historias, ya la pelicula va ser un fracaso SI O SI.

pero tengo esperanza que sea buena y que el cine traiga mas crepypasta (los verdaderos y no las versiones de los niños ratas -_- ) por que slender no es el único CREPYPASTA QUE ESTA AHI"
ySy8mcceTno,PUTA MERDA
ySy8mcceTno,Hold on a minute Is sony for real making a movie about slender man? If soo then i hope they wont screw it up.
ySy8mcceTno,"This looks!!!!
























Very unscary😑"
ySy8mcceTno,This is bad...
ySy8mcceTno,Bunch of weird stuff that has nothing to do with slender man
ySy8mcceTno,*hit like if you want to watch this movie right now*
ySy8mcceTno,Slander man doesn't exist but it's fun to watch this lol.
ySy8mcceTno,Pelicula para niños ratas que asco
ySy8mcceTno,Lmao Sony back at it again with shitty movies
ySy8mcceTno,Omg i am thinking that this is a spiderman trailer........
ySy8mcceTno,It better be good
ySy8mcceTno,This just looks bad. Showed no story line at all
ySy8mcceTno,"Slender man did not appear vert much in this trailer
*SONY WE WANT AN ANOTHER TRAILER*"
ySy8mcceTno,50th
ySy8mcceTno,Awesome
ySy8mcceTno,Cade os BR??
ySy8mcceTno,OMG OMG I can't believe it!! I've been waiting for a proper Slenderman movie for a long time! 😃😭 I'M GOING CRAZY
ySy8mcceTno,This looks like a movie that would be released in January
ySy8mcceTno,They should've done a found footage movie with friends in the woods so you could get that cool camera effect when he's near like in the game's but I think that would've been compared too much to the Blair witch project
ySy8mcceTno,Welp...
ySy8mcceTno,No vi buenos culos :v
ySy8mcceTno,I'm excited but optimistic
ySy8mcceTno,Chabelo :v
ySy8mcceTno,"Mexico , morelos :v"
ySy8mcceTno,I don't scary  it's Comedy movie 😀😁😂
ySy8mcceTno,"Why was there children laughing, and slenderman growling?"
ySy8mcceTno,This is a video game movie.
ySy8mcceTno,*Gimmie $20...* Who gets this?
ySy8mcceTno,This movie is 6 years too late
ySy8mcceTno,Sony's officially out of ideas
ySy8mcceTno,Minecraft 😃
ySy8mcceTno,Idk how I feel about this! I do plan on checking it out nonetheless!
ySy8mcceTno,"Llegas tarde, 6 años tarde"
ySy8mcceTno,"Wanna hear a Joke

*Read more*"
ySy8mcceTno,Finally I found a real trailer.
ySy8mcceTno,perfeccion<3

ySy8mcceTno,Oh no SONY made this!
ySy8mcceTno,This actually looks good
ySy8mcceTno,"Oooh, por fin :D"
ySy8mcceTno,Just in time
ySy8mcceTno,"Ok just like the Spider-Verse movie
I wasn't expecting this"
ySy8mcceTno,"WHAT THE HELL HAVE I WATCHED?! PLEASE STOP SONY, THIS TRAILER IS EVEN SCARIER THAN THE CARS 3 TEASER! Beautiful make-up though












Sony, I will not watch this, but I swear to God, This is going to be Rated PG-13!"
ySy8mcceTno,No first
ySy8mcceTno,What the Hell is This? Lol
ySy8mcceTno,This came out of nowhere
ySy8mcceTno,h
ySy8mcceTno,Arabia
ySy8mcceTno,My wife is scarier than this
ySy8mcceTno,In the trailer you can hear a deep growl that slender seems to make... but slender doesn't make noises. He's always completely silent.
ySy8mcceTno,Here wasn't there a little girl stabbed over him one time? By friends of hers I think it was
ySy8mcceTno,first

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Played out genre. Let's step it up Netflix.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway is korny
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Willem Dafoe alone should be the reason to watch this.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Such a conspiracy they need to assign Batman and Catwoman for the job
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Another garbage.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,thank you for showing the entire movie in one trailer
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I got the biggest crush on Anne💖
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Man I hate women centered movies or TV series.

KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Thought I saw a cameo of Samuel L. Jackson at 1:35
Never mind"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,You had me at Dee Rees
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This movie is panned by critics. I saw it at Sundance and one of the worst movies ever made.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"This film is literally the last thing i wanted ...oh shit Dafoe is in it? Im watching this, Anne is a great actress even if she is still kinda on my top 5 list....of most annoying actors... it's more because i just hated that princess diary movie, so fake. 

This looks great but Ben Affleck, yes, this is the last thing i wanted. XD ive probably seen 100,000 films by now, what's 1 more?"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Music?

KmrU6gMc1Lc,I won’t watch it just because Ben ruined Batman
KmrU6gMc1Lc,NOPE 👎🏾 won’t be watching this SHIT!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Background music:

KmrU6gMc1Lc,S
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Andy is really doing what she meanted to do then: a reporter......great job Miranda
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I’m here for Anne Hathaway ❤️❤️
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Wonder if she will be showing those Elicious titties in this movie like she has in every movie she has ever been in.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway with those clothes and a gun I'M ALL IN
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Straight to DVD
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Sundance report: I saw this a few nights ago at Sundance and I am deeply disappointed to report that the movie makes absolutely no sense. If you don’t believe me, check out the preliminary Rotten Tomatoes reviews.

After it comes out on Netflix, if someone here can explain what happens (who is the guy in the cowboy hat?, for example), I would sincerely appreciate an explanation.

I promise this isn’t a troll post. I was able to follow the plot for the first, maybe, 30-45 minutes or so, but then it took so many twists that it twisted over on top of itself and the Sundance audience, at least, was completely lost.

Please don’t judge until you watch it for yourself. I am really bummed — big fan of Dee Rees am I’m not sure what went wrong."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck always looks like Ben Affleck. Hmmm. Weird.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This is why my Netflix won't be cancelled. They keep bringing the goods. February is going to be fire. Good thing to it's my birthday month.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Frankly I m crazy insane Anne hathaway if a market so much the better for her me frankly ciao let me trankil in sin neflix reports bizness is bizness you have to eat excuse me my intelligent franchisee supposedly we you it grd force for you the film last thing he  wanted the whole team to shoot the film god really loves you he has action and betrayal and drama suspect and dialogue corruption ciao serious tribute to the victims Houston Texas or Turkey sincerely ditto kobe Bryant and as cute as you keep ciao don't like Anne Hathaway ciao
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Sounds like someone bought the most standard cinematic trailers sounds and whacked them on as they came.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Plz Netflix make a web series on Harry Potter...plz plz plz...we potterheads will love to watch the series
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This looks good. It would have been great if Dee Rees has hired a black actress in lead role.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,La Rosie Perez!!!! Yeeeessss
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Green Goblin is also in this! Not just Batman and Catwoman.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Why would i watch a drunk? Afflack is one, from i have seen. It is a most unappealing trait in a man. Lack of control is not an attractive feature. The disease has phases, a progression. Am not going to volunteer to watch it happen."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"If Bafleck is in it, for sure is going to stink. 
Mark my words this movie is going to suck.
Too bad for Anne Hathaway she’s pretty good on screen"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Last year Hathaway has a tough year, I’m glad she’s coming back"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"WOW so guerrillas in Costa Rica..... who was the complete idiot that came up with this? Our country doesnt even have an army and we dont need one, you guys are going to get alot of hate for this one you idiots"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Bring back lillyhammer . And if none of you have watched it. Watch it !
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Filmed in Puerto Rico set in Costa Rica  the story has to do with “guerrillas” in CR.

But Costa Rica is a Democratic Republic that abolished the army in 1984..."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Mr. Wayne, you're sending Miss Kyle on a mission alone? What kind of gentleman are you... smh"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,That looked great. I’m in.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,From the very first scene I thought Anne resembled Joan Didion in the 70s... soso cool! Can’t wait for this one!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck looks fat
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"That´s not my country, Costa Rica"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"A movie directed by a black lesbian. The medias are gonna have a hard time criticizing it. Which will be interesting to watch. Because it will probably be bad. I mean, it's Netflix, so I give it 75% chances to be bad."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"As a costa rican, I must admit, I'm a little weary of how it will be portrayed"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Is it good movie ?
Should i watch ?"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Feb 21st?? I'll forget all about it by then!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I'm watching. And Hathaway William Dafoe I'm watching. Looks really good. Netflix is killing it here lately.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway getting top billing in a movie with Ben Affleck and Willem Dafoe. What a legend.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Catwoman:How did you find me?
Batman:I am Batman!"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I miss when Netflix actually had movies you wanted to see and not these crappy originals. Most of these original are nothing good nor anything Interesting I wanted to watch
KmrU6gMc1Lc,AFFLACK 🦆
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Why is Anne Hathaway looking like a young Jamie Lee Curtis?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,NIKON F 1:27
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Rosie perez, cant wait to see her"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,If Anne Hathaway is in it im in.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Propaganda. I will still watch the movie. Separate the person from the artist and nothing is 100% reality, there is more fiction than actuality."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,And why on earth we should affiliate them with superheroes all the time?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,The bat and the cat together again.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,look mediocre
KmrU6gMc1Lc,How the hell can Affleck's face be bloated AND still flat as a pancake at the same time?!?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway is underrated pretty
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway reminds me of dory for some reason
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Netflix release Dee Rees film in February:

Everyone: So you’re saying it’s not good?"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Looks like another movie filmed in Puerto Rico
KmrU6gMc1Lc,> lap...
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I am from Costa Rica and in here looks like Mexico
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Nothing like decent movies becoming awful for making stupid move like saying is Costa Rica and they didn't even came to the country to film!! 🤦🤦🤦
KmrU6gMc1Lc,That is NOT COSTA RICA! COME ON PEOPLE!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Interesting.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,this looks so good
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman and Catwoman?? And Renee Montoya with Vulko? Is this the new Batman movie?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Yes Netflix u keeping me home from the movies..on a roll
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"-“Remember to keep comments respectful and to follow our community guidelines.”

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Seems boring 🤔.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Catwoman, Batman, and Green Goblin all in one movie."

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Green Goblin is Catwomans dad? I’m in.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"O no not another urinalist movie, never seen that before. And another anti-gun liberal running around with a gun. Should be labled under feminist fantasy hypocrites."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,You had me at 90%
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben affleck... cmon..
KmrU6gMc1Lc,batfleck looks like a cgi
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Those 2 are usually 💤. This looks good though , Netflix is on a role lately besides Fauda 😉. We get Adam in a drama 🍿 not a silly comedy and now a serious no-nonsense flick from Hathaway ... it’s a serious deal !"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"netflix has been on a roll of late, cant wait for this one"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix is producing more movies than Hollywood.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben looks like Tom Cruise
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"@netflix, you do realize we can tell the movie wasn’t filmed in Costa Rica, right? Also, a little  political background don’t hurt...we have no army or guerrilla (in Spanish), and our bus rides are WAY WAY different...I’m a little offended I admit."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,B.Affleck muhaha
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"I cannot stand Ben Affleck, but this looks very interesting, especially after I heard the 'Contras'. If this has anything to do with the Iran-Contras affair, one of the biggest scandals in US modern history and that has never had a movie about it made, I'm 100% in. That said, not a single place, person or accent sounded like it was in Nicaragua, so not sure if it's about this lol. Looks more like Panama/Colombia (places, racial mixes, streets, etc.), more than central america 🤔"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Oh my God yes! Joan Didion for the win!!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Oh Joan Didion what have they done to you!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Why does Anne Hathaway look like Jessica Biel on the thumbnail?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,oh is this the new Batman and Catwoman movie?

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This cast 😮
KmrU6gMc1Lc,The graphic design on the title looks a lot like “ready or not” swat game
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I'd watch it if he didn't ruin batman
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Costa Rica??? Really????
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Better Bat & Cat then what we got for The Batman.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Why does Rosy look hotter than ever and I can’t say the same for Anne
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Wow back ground music is killing 🎸🎻🎹🎼🎧

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Army in Costa Rica.... What a joke? Learn history Netflix
KmrU6gMc1Lc,ı just finished all season of blacklist and  i like it could someone give me advice serius like blacklist. Main topic can be politicial please guys give me advice
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Wow there's something about Anne Hathaway pulling off this type of movie better than Kate Beckinsale in the Widow.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Batwoman as Lois Lane, Batman as Some Guy who is NOT Batman and Green Goblin another shitty father? Only on Netflix."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"not gonna lie, I legit thought this was a biopic. A couple weeks ago I was listening to a story on NPR about a reporter who decides to work for the CIA and ends up planting herself as a buyer with arms dealers, and wow the storyline in this trailer follows that thread closely, despite the fictional novel coming out decades prior."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This is the one thing he didn't want to happen.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,She seems aged
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"No, we don't have guerrilla in Costa Rica. No, they didn't film it in Costa Rica. Costa Rica =/= Puerto Rico"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"This trailer didn't answer to the question...






Do you bleed?"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Darn netflix been making goof movies as of late
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Great trailer! Now I don’t have to watch the movie.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"From directed Drew Brees.  Me: ahh... that explains the yellow tint.

PS: I know that’s not the actual name"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,1.66:1 aspect ratio is a weird choice but ok
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck... Zzzzzzz. Wilem Dafoe nowadays.. Zzzzzz. Story Zzzzz

KmrU6gMc1Lc,"This world is full of conspiracies , every year 2 or conspiracies"

KmrU6gMc1Lc,"So batman , catwoman and green goblin"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,You people are releasing series and movies faster than we can follow
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman & Catwoman uWu
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Why is everything that looks good rated R?!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Those who said Netflix would die by the hands of Disney+ are crazy!

KmrU6gMc1Lc,A Netflix film doesnt encourage praise anymore.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I see Defoe and I know it will be kick ass and thrilling.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I have no idea what’s going on but I see William Dafoe and Anne Hathaway so im watching it.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Typical Netflix: US right-wingers bad (we'll just ignore communist atrocities by the communist junta)
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Would watch it for Anne Hathaway 💓
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Catwoman
Batman

KmrU6gMc1Lc,The pirate from Captain Phillips looks buff AF.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I understand that my girl Anne wants to make real movies but I don't believe her.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This looks like one of those slow paced political thrillers that I find too slow to enjoy
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I suppose ben is good guy here
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I bet she has to show her boobs to make the movie a little bit better.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,She’s smoking. I’m not watching this.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ha a reporter with a moral compass. This is a fantasy movie.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I love Anne Hathaway!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Is this about the contras?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman and catwoman have a new movie. 🤔
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Who want's Anne Hathaway in new  sifi like interstellar.

KmrU6gMc1Lc,This is the time when movies at the theaters suck and movies streaming at home are great.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Wtf Netflix i got exams in February dude. (A joke)
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Rename it to ""white man's burden: the movie"".

If you're going to make a movie about the Iran contra scandal, at least base it on historic fact."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"So,,another ARGO"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,those 17 billion they are spending are paying off. they are making good movies so far. now they need good series. or the next friends or the next seinfeld.

KmrU6gMc1Lc,I love how in every movie they say that it is not a movie that's not how things work in real world. Lol

KmrU6gMc1Lc,I can see Edi Gathegi so I must watch
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne finally filled out in that ass
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Sooo...basically, a Batman & Catwoman movie."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,i can never agree w/ Ben Affleck’s face

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Green goblin and detective Renee Montoya! Teaming up!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix rocks ... everyday new trailer ... contents flooded.. Disney and apple will never beat
KmrU6gMc1Lc,trailer wasnt intense enough. needs more cinematic stomps and rises...
KmrU6gMc1Lc,talk about star studded 🌟
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Anne Hathaway went from princess movies to action movies, what a queen!!!"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"How much did they change from the novel?  Well, there is no Rosie Perez character in the book.  The two leads are just wrong.  Ben Affleck as a sophisticated, powerful and esteemed government official?  Please.  He still can’t move his face.  The Anne Hathaway character never has a gun nor is she in combat in the novel.  The surprise at the finish isn’t going to work when there’s explosions and action everywhere.  This is a betrayal of Joan Didion’s work."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This is Catwoman vs Batman vs Green Goblin
KmrU6gMc1Lc,William Dafoe cashing disney and netflix checks.

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Willem Dafoe: ye fond of my parenting are ye?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Wait let me understand this Hollyweird wants to revisit Iran-Contra (circa 1986) but Obama gives a pallet of cash to Iran just 4 years ago and Hollyweird can't be bothered to tell that story??? Who are they making these movies for? No wonder the theaters are empty.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,querooo

KmrU6gMc1Lc,"I like it. Yeah Netflix, show Disney+ you been here first and you ain’t going nowhere."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Nice work!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Yes.......
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Goddamn I did not recognize Anne. 

This looks amazing."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,The last thing he wanted? Another movie of u Annie! 😂
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"""Now get out of the car, and shoot him in the head!"""
KmrU6gMc1Lc,come subscribe in my chanel for more HD trailers it s easy to do but it will really help me maybe my suscriber a few but i m making good content Thank u
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Thank God we have another movie with a 'strong' woman, this time taking on the ultimate patriarchy; her father. Can't wait to be bathed in female virtue and male deceit / corruption / violence / toxicity, etc."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Willem Dafoe is on everything right now :/
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"""The story centers around Elena McMahon, a reporter for the Washington Post who quits her job covering the 1984 United States presidential election to care for her father after her mother's death. In an unusual turn of events, she inherits his position as an arms dealer for the U.S. Government in Central America. In this sparsely written, quick paced narrative, Elena struggles to cope with the spies, American military personnel, and the consequences of her father's errors that are waiting for her on a small island off the coast of Costa Rica."""
KmrU6gMc1Lc,The devil works but Willem Dafoe works harder lol.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix...who needs a Cinema anymore?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"So Netflix got both Superman, Batman, and Catwoman now"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,To bad reporters don't really do any reporting nowadays.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Slow down Netflix..I cant take it all at once
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix smashing again...it seems
KmrU6gMc1Lc,So many new show trailers but none available to watch on Netflix. Cool ....
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Finally, a good strong, meaty roll for Anne Hathaway"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,man this is good
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I love Anne
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I would be glad if you subscribe to my channel too🎈
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Trailer, Bwwaaaaaaaaaaa."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"So Batman, Catwoman, and Green Goblin walk into a bar....."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Hope this film won't be garbage like the last ben Affleck Netflix flim
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Another Oscar for Anne, please and thank you!"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben looks plump😂
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck looking like a Baldwin! Deep fake?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Ok Netflix I see y'all, out here flexing for Feb 💯"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,And the release date?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,The same same f..... Hollywood faces all the time!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"No other streaming service can beat netflix
This here is the proof
Trailer is great"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,And this is why I subscribe to Netflix and pirate Disney Plus. Original content.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,ROSIE PEREZ 😍😘💜 MY CHILDHOOD CRUSH I'M STILL CRUSHING 💯💎
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Is that Rosie Perez I see
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Me: Practicing how to give Netflix $30 a month
KmrU6gMc1Lc,What’s the music?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Didn't Tom Cruise do this movie already?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Give this woman an Oscar for best actress already.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Former Batman & Catwoman
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Yes Netflix. Keep these coming.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,looks early netflix.  cheap.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,just drop likes fro BATMAN and go watch Spenser confidential trailer.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"The last thing he wanted.....








*WAS A SANDWICH*"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Affleck is back on track! Can't wait to see this but especially can't wait to see The Way Back! Seems like that film could possibly give him that Oscar Nomination for Best Actor finally! I am just saying possibly because the movie hasn't came out yet but by the trailer I was already enjoying what I was seeing from those few little clips of him, I always appreciated Ben Affleck's Acting and Directing , a lot of people say he can be sometimes very wooden in his performances and In some way I can see that but if you give him the right material oh man he can do no wrong. I think he is even better director than an actor and movies like The Town and Argo proved that! The Town is one of my favorites of his."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman look old this time...
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Love Dee Rees and this looks great. Can't wait.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Disney plus, my  ass."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,😅
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Queen Anne Hathaway 👑🌟❤️❤️❤️❤️🌟
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This is gonna suck
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Another movie about arming the Contras? Best story was about Gary Webb and nobody seemed to care.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Looks interesting. I wish Anne Hathaway was in more action-esque films, esp. after her role as Catwoman."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"*Willem Dafoe is everywhere!*
👌"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck looks like an old alcoholic.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,so catwoman and batman are doing a movie together?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Lol at Darwin with a mexican accent 😂
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Is that the actor who played the Goblin in the first Spider Man movie?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Love the description.
Oscar. Emmy.
Only the best."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Ben Affleck:  DC Universe 
Willem Dafoe: Marvel Universe
Anna Hathaway: Is the white queen a joke to you?
Tim Burton: *Silence*"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This looks shit
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"All I know is, I want the *Green Goblin* to win this time."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I can't wait for this movie!🔥🔥
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Ben’s looking good, so is Dafoe."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway literally never ages 😂👏
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Hey remember that time when Catwoman and Rene Montoya went to Costa Rica to meet Green Goblin and Batman followed them?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman meets Catwoman whose father is a Green Goblin
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I love self-righteous Hollywood movies about journalists. They are my favorite kind.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"""Costa Rica"" 🙌"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"I dont know why, but i just cant watch Anne Hathaway movies anymore. Since the hustle and serenity, i see shes in it and i just switch off."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Yassss rozie perez
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"There’s Batman and Catwoman! 
Guess who’s Robin? 👻"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Fake news
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix out here running the game
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"You sonova bitch, I’m in!"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Am I the only person who doesn't feel netflix movies the way one feels watching *Warner Bros* 
*Sony* 
*20th century Fox*  
*Colombia* 
*MGM* 
*TSG*  
written before the movie starts no matter how good the movie is. ☺️☺️"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Looks brilliant! Love her 💞
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Nice hopefully good, to match the great cast"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batfleck forever!🦇
KmrU6gMc1Lc,They better be fond of his lobster or someone is really gonna get hurt
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"SO, Ben Affleck works for Netflix now??"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,A movie with Ben Affleck and Anne Hathaway is also the last thing I wanted
KmrU6gMc1Lc,GOOD JOB 👍🏼
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway is I needed to see
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Man that last line was horrible ""in a perfect world we make perfect choices in a real world we make real choices"""
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman and Catwoman always team up! 😎

KmrU6gMc1Lc,He looks just like he was in Justice League.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,this looks great and epic I can't wait to see it is this a true story
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"The clever woman once again uncovers a conspiracy of bad, white, old men and one of them is of course her own father. But at least NETFLIX doesn't even try to hide the fact that activists are designing the program here."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This is why netflix is superior. Quality content with a hell lot of variety.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,1:31 Jon Snow?? 🤔
KmrU6gMc1Lc,1:35 and Samuel Jackson
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"so movie without a namy
i mean why?

😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ricky Gervais was right. All big star HAVE jumped onto Netflix!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Between this and Birds of Prey, I'm so here for this Rosie Perez comeback that's happening 💖"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I really wish trailers these days didnt give away so much of the damn plot
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This looks exactly like a movie I watched on Disney+ called Dumbo.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Soooo batman finally met catwoman??
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman & Catwoman
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"DC Comics side story movie? Ben is Batman, Annie was Cat, Will is in Aquaman and Rosie Perez in the Birds of Prey. 😄"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"A new DCEU? 😅 
But
It looks interesting"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Who is from 2019? like )
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I see you Rosie!!!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Netflix and maybe HBO are the only places to make movies like this anymore. Large Studios cannot get funding to make a movie like this. If a project can't generate licensing & merchandising revenue then WB, Universal, Paramount, Disney, Lionsgate, and Sony aren't interested."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Please let this be good
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Anne Hathaway? Ben Affleck?.,...............?
Netflix is on the way of taking over the movie business."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway is still hot.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Goddamnit Ben Affleck is always looking sharp like Bruce Wayne
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Looks good. I will WATCH!!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Batman, Catwoman and ihopewillemdafoeplayingJOKERinthefuturesomehow"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Nobody mentioning Dee Rees as director!! I'm so proud to see where is she's now working with the best!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Willem Dafoe is everywhere
KmrU6gMc1Lc,dO a StRaNgEr ThInGs 4 TrAiLeR nOw!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,New Batman (Ben Affleck) & Old Catwomen (Anna Hathway) finally in a Netflix.

KmrU6gMc1Lc,NETSICK Trailer
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Only Netflix can bring Batman, Catwoman and Green Goblin in one movie."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Netflix just grow and grow, as the quality. Soon we will have Netflix movie/series awards."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,1:30 Is that Jon Snow?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,i need a short answer... is it to clap some booty?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Thus kinda reminds me of the accountant... I would loooove a sequel of that damn

KmrU6gMc1Lc,I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS WHEN DOES IT PLAY ON GERMAN NETFLIX
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Nothing like cinema quality movies at home.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This is going to be really great or really bad
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"why does every movie trailer have unnecessary, loud banging drums as background music? 

Doesn't actually generate excitement. Also distracting. Can we finally please move on from this decade-old trend."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Yessss! Anne Hathaway, Ben Afflek AND Vosie Pevez!! I'm here for it."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Man, Willem Dafoe was snubbed this year. His acting in The Lighthouse was masterful."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"While Joker and Batman meets in Morbius.
Catwoman and Batman will meet here"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Anyone else have the hots for Rosie Perez ever since ""White Men Can't Jump""?"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Kylo Ren and Black Widow got a movie and now Batman and Catwoman are having one Netflix movie.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Catwoman , Batman & Green Goblin wow"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,ben affeck looks been on the process on De Aging Tech
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Everybody can't win an Oscar for this. Everyone will up in the conversation though. Guaranteed winner of the SAG award for best ensemble though. Come back this time next year and see if I am right.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman Catwoman and the green goblin ✅  ✅  ✅
KmrU6gMc1Lc,When Batman got fat and Catwoman got old.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Horseface hathaway
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Great cast. Not sure how entertaining it's gona be though
KmrU6gMc1Lc,When did Ben gain that much weight? What happened?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This looks cool!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"So Anne Hathaway has freckles.


Who knew?"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,looks crud
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I’m so in!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,It seems like netflix movies r getting bigger n better. Looking forward to it.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Looking for batman,catwoman comment??...me too :)"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,When did Netflix started getting this good at movies?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Netflix:Got a new movie...  Dafoe... Hathaway...Affleck... film adaption....takes place in the 80s .....spy thriller.

me: You son of bitch...I am in.."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"EX batman & EX catwoman in another movie, hmm interesting....."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Looks promising
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Barry is messing with the timeline again huh?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,We all forget how much we love Rosie Perez.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Fat Batman and catwoman
KmrU6gMc1Lc,1 month later 😡😡😡
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This trailer looks promising let's see whether the movie is also promising or not
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Офигеть Энн ❤️😻
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"This looks Good, Netflix need somthing Good,"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,It's kinda funny how sunburnt Anne is throughout the footage lol
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I dont think people realize what Netflix is doing. It will be the amazon of movies soon.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Is it me or is it random to see Rosie Perez in stuff lately, I like her by all means but I was even shocked to see her in Birds of Prey. Pretty big comeback"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Oh, Affleck. Another movie I won't see because the loud mouth actor can't help but constantly tell non elitists how wrong they are about everything. I can't see these type of actors as their character anymore. Only for who they really are. Ignorant, entitled and out of touch."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Короче Hathfleck
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"First good movie from Netflix in long time..  I hope they make these type movies rather then those stupid ""tal girl"" or some dumb shit"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Running out + Airport = Argo
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"And true gems in a week, 2020 here we go"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Yooooooo
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"February release date come on Netflix it means this movie already losses thier chance to the Oscars and some awards season this 2020, Anne Hathaway was on my list of prediction for Best Actress in this particular movie 'The Last Thing He Wanted' now she will drop below on my chart of prediction no Oscars 2021 for Anne and film itself, but maybe for Golden Globe for Best Actress for Drama Motion Picture & and Independent Spirit awards just a nomination I'll guess"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Anne: do you know I was catwoman?
Ben: yes, because I'm batman, well I was"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Looking good , definitely going to check this out👍"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"i gotta say, it looks good"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Quite intriguing! Anne Hathaway is rocking as always & Dafoe is😍😍 and Affleck looks sharp in this. 


I'm really quite excited for this & i hope Affleck might direct another film soon after Live By Night(although had potential, it isn't able to flesh out the amazing novel storyline in glory.. imo i think it felt like the film has been cut out a lot & i do believe it has a directors cut imo.)"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Whoa! easy on the Botox there, Affleck"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Is there any time Netflix run out of content? You're good man! 
P.s. I am an actor and i hope someday i work with you on a very best content🧡"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Has Ben had work on his face?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Watching this only for Ann Hathaway
KmrU6gMc1Lc,netflix is changing the game y’all
KmrU6gMc1Lc,OMG! Willem Dafoe is everywhere!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"i was just about search this movie on app until i saw ""this february"". another waiting list :("
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"everyone : Batman, Catwoman and Green goblin


me: fuckin Renee Montoya.....


Rosie Perez is just getting amazing..."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Plot twist: Hathaway's character is a secret arms dealer and it's Batman's job to stop her. 


Also William Dafoe goes out on his own terms, again."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,it's batman and catwoman y'all!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,So good to see Ben Affleck again!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck looks really old. His health looks really bad :(
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Seems lime every big actor sees the writing on the wall and Is now moving to the streaming services 😆
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Blink and you'll miss it: Spanish Samuel L. Jackson @ 1:34
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Super
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Damn, Netflix is killing it lately. Irishman, Witcher, Sabrina part 3, Altered Carbon season 2 etc."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Using guns this time! Batman and Catwomen together again!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Had this been good, Netflix would have released this between Oct-Dec"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,NETFLIX JUST CAN'T STOP GOING. THEY'RE ON A STREAK
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Rosie Perez,lol"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Why is the background music so loud?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Didn’t see any black ppl. Obviously racist.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,1:10 ..he lukd like javier bardem
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix has not stopped since Disney plus dropped 😭😭
KmrU6gMc1Lc,She the GOD of war. Damn i remember that movie
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Welp, looks like another Oscar for Hathaway and Affleck"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Edi Gathegi, enough said."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I hope Netflix beats Disney
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck? All I see is Bruce Wayne.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Looks good
KmrU6gMc1Lc,If only this movie had better director...
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"First mistake female director, second mistake Ann Hathaway. Put this in the movie theaters nobody goes to see it, Netflix buys it you get it for free. I'm still not going to watch it."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"I’m a simple person.
I see Anne Hathaway, I click."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck 🥰❤
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Where’d her eyebrows go to?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix is taking over the movie industry
KmrU6gMc1Lc,1:30 Jon Snow after he went over the wall.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Looking interesting n engaging... waiting Anne Hathaway...👍
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I still miss Jules...!! ♥️♥️
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I'm sorry William dafeo was robbed of a Oscar nomination this year or am I the only one that was mind blown by his performance in lighthouse?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This year will be great for movies
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Sooooo
Catwoman is actually Greengoblin's daughter and she tries to expose Batman.
Typical"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This looks really good!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"I think Netflix should focus on putting out better content than chasing Big Stars and Directors to prove that they run the game. The company is already in so much debt. The last thing we need is for Netflix to get bankrupt and put end to all our favorite TV series! 
No need to be so desperate,  Netflix."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Here is my theory: This is set after the events from The Dark Knight Rises. Catwoman (Selina Kyle) is isolated from everyone, Batman  (Bruce Wayne) has decided to work in the legal line,and Norman Osborne somehow miraculously survived,but here's the thing: 
1) Green Goblin has taken over his mind.
2) Selina is his abandoned illegitimate daughter.
They somehow reconnected over her teenage years, and although haven't spoken in a long time,they keep in touch."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,The title looks like some kind of vintage porno.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Catwoman chased by Batman, just the usual😆 and somehow Vulko’s helping miss Kyle."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Not a great trailer, but I'll bite."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"In the thumbnail, Anne Hathaway looks exactly like the female version of Rust Cohle ( Mathew Mcgonahay ) from True Detective lol"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Disney+ > Netflix.

Next joke please. 😂😂😂"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Are u kidding me !!! She needs to be nominated for an Oscar !!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Yes Catwoman. This is the right Batman.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This movie gives me Sicario and Jack Ryan vibes
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Catwoman Batman and the Green Goblin go on Vacation
KmrU6gMc1Lc,more usa internal propaganda
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Hulu, Amazon, HBO and Disney+ making Netflix step up..."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Omg NETFLIX really wants my money sooooo bad.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,BEN AFFLECK IS GONNA BE IN A TEAR THIS YEAR WITH THIS THE WAY BACK BASKETBALL MOVIE AND and DEEP WATER WITH ANA DE ARMAS
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Hope they don't pull a Jurassic Park and show the capitol of Costa Rica as a beach with 3 chickens and a shack
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"The last thing he wanted.
Yeah your boobs."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Damn look at those makeup trying to make Anne Hathaway looks like an 'average' looking tropical girl 😂😂😂
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Will she NEVER age?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Netflix pulling out different stuff everyday . Worth what i pay
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I have no doubt this movie will be great but this trailer sucked. Netflix needs to do a better job with their trailers
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"catwoman, batman and the joker we deserve."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,All i want from her is Princess Diaries 3 😭
KmrU6gMc1Lc,February is good month for Netflix
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"This looks great. I want Ben Affleck to get back on track. Should have never took the Batman deal. After ""Argo"" and ""The Town"" I'd like to see him start directing again. This looks good though. I just think that 2015-2019 period where his focus was on Batman really hurt his pride and messed with his mojo."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben got paid 6Million for this garbage?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,You know it's good when Anne doesn't care about sunscreen anymore
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Damn Netflix really said they ain’t going out like no bitch
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Bat Efflick is back
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I feel a bit of Argo vibes in this film.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"This looks good. But I have the same thought whenever I see a Netflix movie trailer. ""If it was really good, they would have released it in the theater"""
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Great Netflix
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Catwoman, Batman (or Daredevil), and Green Goblin together in one movie? Yes please."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,All hail Netflix!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I'm in love with Affleck ever since his Batman gig. I never noticed him before and seen a lot of his movies but he charmed me after Batman. He's a nice guy who deserves more chances
KmrU6gMc1Lc,What is Disney+ ?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Yay Anne is stepping onto the Netflix game 😁
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Catwoman meets Green Goblin/Vulko and Daredevil/Batman
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Is this true story ?
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne hathaway?? I m in!!!! All time fav!!

KmrU6gMc1Lc,I’m in
KmrU6gMc1Lc,i haven't seen her this serious since the Dark Knight Rises.. love it!!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,This looks like a Tv movie where the trailer is cut together to make it look like a big Blockbuster. Im not impressed.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,What is this? Argo 2??😂😂
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Bruce finally meets Selina for the final circle of their Twilight Love Story? BETTER THAN TWILIGHT!!!!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ugh Ben Affleck
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Joan Didion is one of our last legendary journalists/writers/thinkers PERIOD. Highly highly suggest watching her Netflix documentary “Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold” 🙌🏼

KmrU6gMc1Lc,yes bats
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Oh my cat woman 😍😍😍
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Willem dafoe : you know I'm something of a father myself.

KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Anne Hathaway is awesome, isn't she?👍"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Green Goblin, Batman and Catwoman in the same movie ..here is the comment you’re looking for"

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne Hathaway looks so orange trump might adopt her
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Selina Kyle, Bruce Wayne and the Norman Osbourn."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Im surprised Anne Hathaway just made a movie under Netflix. This must be hella good!!!
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Up to the mark 😘
KmrU6gMc1Lc,really love how they can make a flick about a  courageous truth finding reporter when we all know they are corporate hacks with an agenda.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,lord of war reskinned??
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Batman and catwoman in same movie❤️🔥
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"So basically, The Green Goblin's daughter, The Catwoman is trying to still find the software she was promised by The Batman in the Dark Kinght Rises."

KmrU6gMc1Lc,And I love Netflix.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Something to definitely look forward to.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben Affleck is the perfect Bruce Wayne (Personally my favourite Batman as well though that is more polarizing)
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"Batman, Catwoman, Nuidis Vulko and Renee Montoya in a ""Not"" DC Movie."
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Could go either way on this one.  There's enough there for me to at least take a look.  The title's awful though.

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Ben aff😍🤘

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Like the fact that Rosie Perez is getting more major roles.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,I thought this was a sequel to Ben Afflecks last Netflix movie where he died lol
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"The last thing I wanted
Anne Hathaway as Catwoman
Been Affleck as Batman"
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Hathaway surprises me...she loves acting..she does it becauas she loves her work....she stays free from drama and the paps as much as she can anf focuses on her career. Look how far shes gone
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Anne is on fire.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,The movie will be violent if someone sees it like it
KmrU6gMc1Lc,Boring plot.
KmrU6gMc1Lc,"*Selina and Bruce, together again for the first time!*"

KmrU6gMc1Lc,Bat and Cat

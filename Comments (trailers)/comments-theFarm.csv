nTTMeo5TwkA,"""Now the farm wants it's revenge"". Seriously? They couldn't even get ""its"" right?"

nTTMeo5TwkA,smdh...fuckin white people...
nTTMeo5TwkA,creepy...... horrible.....
nTTMeo5TwkA,"so did anyone notice the massive wrong type of grammar a high quality trailer used??? ""it's revenge""    when it is supposed to be ""its revenge"". call me grammar police that's fine. but if they have money to spend on blood, I'm certain they would have had the money to spell check lol . just really grinds my gears."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Directed by Animal aid
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is how animals got treated so humans deserve this!!!!
nTTMeo5TwkA,Now the farm wants *it's* revenge
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Another stupid, disgusting movie made for the sheer violence and disgust of it all.  Film makers have lost it big time,  I thought the asinine Centipede movies were bad and sick.  This right up there."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Please let me go to the movies and not get a liberal f#ing message. I give. I'll sign a paper before a movie, if you'll just make good movies again. i get it: 1. All white men suck 2.All villains are blond with blue eyes 3. Poor people are not poor because they make bad decisions, they are poor because the man keeps him down. 4. All Christians are idiots 5. The world is ending yesterday because of global warming"
nTTMeo5TwkA,yeah i'm now vegan
nTTMeo5TwkA,"*Spoiler Alert*
1:19 you can see that the girl, (main character) died of getting cut into half. 
So no need to watch it. üòä"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"At :44 that's the mask from ""You're Next"""
nTTMeo5TwkA,The comment section is full of vegans and meat eaters fighting..
nTTMeo5TwkA,i'd rather watch porn...
nTTMeo5TwkA,okay vegans win
nTTMeo5TwkA,"a real vegan movie, must be use cg animals making food from humans, not this trash movie, this is just sick cannibalism, people eating people, this is unnatural, american trash hollywood movie, easy cash grab from sick persons."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Is this about veganism or canabalism
nTTMeo5TwkA,Getting a peta vibe from this
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Wow, new Hotline Miami looks great!"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Fos
nTTMeo5TwkA,Like it!
nTTMeo5TwkA,I'm sure the director is an angry vegan
nTTMeo5TwkA,I eat fish
nTTMeo5TwkA,Anything but not a horror movie
nTTMeo5TwkA,is that wyatt brothers?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"vegans dont eat meat, including human meat :)"
nTTMeo5TwkA,0:59 is that a baby?
nTTMeo5TwkA,So I suppose someone have heard one of these jokes about vegans and decided to make a film. Lol.
nTTMeo5TwkA,When does this movie come out??
nTTMeo5TwkA,Ain't nobody gonna mention the Wyatt Family?üòÇüòÇ
nTTMeo5TwkA,"ok i love horror, but to me this goes to far, weighing a baby on a scale , like its beef is just plain sick.. horror genre needs to clean house and put only films in it with supernatural elements to it.. this kind of film is slasher blood and guts and has no real plot except to produce mindless sick gore. i really cant see how anyone would be entertained by that, or even watch it.jmo"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Well we‚Äôre are the same as cows chickens and pigs. 




Just kidding I‚Äôm not vegan lol."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Gordon Ramsay: It's fucking rrrrraawwww!!!
nTTMeo5TwkA,what the name of the movie
nTTMeo5TwkA,Elle est o√π la bande annonce vf ?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"As a person who‚Äôs family owns a beef cattle stud, it could be worse, you get free food, all the fuckin you want and when your time comes it‚Äôs quick and painless. Better then a cow in the wild getting ripped apart by lions. This movie is a very inaccurate representation of how people in the agricultural industry treat their animals. Plus most animals are kept free range, well at least in Australia they are."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Good thing I'm a vegetarian :)
nTTMeo5TwkA,I HATE THIS :(

nTTMeo5TwkA,My mom asks why i dont take walks
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I don't know, there's SO MANY of these type movies out already, it seems like film makers today are just stuck in 'Do Over Mode'..... How many times can we shoot the same film, only from a different angle and maybe the viewers won't notice......"
nTTMeo5TwkA,How are people so sick

nTTMeo5TwkA,Is this vegan propaganda?  Because its got me lol
nTTMeo5TwkA,Metaphor: a white American couple are surrounded by murderous people from a different culture.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Best Vegan commercial ever.
nTTMeo5TwkA,vegan propaganda at its finest
nTTMeo5TwkA,Meanwhile in the Parallel Universe.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Don‚Äôt you just hate vegans?
nTTMeo5TwkA,What is the real title from this film?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Oh this is dark...
nTTMeo5TwkA,Wait so we have vegan horror movies now?  Vegans are the boogeyman now? Hahahahahahaha
nTTMeo5TwkA,This trailer is too gruesome for YouTube
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I'm gonna go be a vegetarian now, thank you."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Seeing this it's pretty obvious there'll be a bad ending since the movie is made by vegans. The movie would result in more negative and aggressive views towards vegans and not think about switching to meat substitutes. reasons why some don't switch its because vegan food is expensive wheres as non vegan is cheap. Anybody noticed that? when will vegan protein be the same price or at least cheaper meat? does that diner restaurant offer vegan menu? is it cheaper than the meat?  

And about the farm on raising animals you need to understand on raising a farm healthy and properly so that animals don't get sick, diseased and die quickly from infections. that's animal abuse and the death of animals results in a huge loss of profit, think of the bird flu epidemic wiping out farm businesses. I'm pretty sure that if people were trapped in there are more likely to get sick and die from lack medication and more quickly since unlike animals we need clothes to keep warm and a proper human shelter needs that does not result us into getting pneumonia, a lung infection that does result in death. 

As for the babies and giving birth again it's more likely the mother is stressed and she's not fed properly and will result into both of them dying. I watched vegan videos arguing with farmers when it comes to sheep sheering, the sheeps needs to have the hair removed not in an aggressive manner that results into having bruises or cuts which results having bacteria enter the system and causes disease and also to remove fleas and ticks and prevents disease. It's obvious vegans don't know anything about raising farm animals and they are more likely to cause them death and more baby animals dying since unlike farmers they pay attention to their dietary needs. And as for the kidnapped humans i would say much more sooner than animals due to difference in needs.  

If the movie is to teach the non-vegans a lesson and emotionally manipulating us. then how come not teach carnivore animals a lesson, you know lions, tigers and bears. as for PETA encouraging to become vegans, do the know they feed meat to cats and dogs? are they stupid or something?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Why Erick Rowan here?
nTTMeo5TwkA,wrong turn : remastered.....

nTTMeo5TwkA,I NEED TO SEE THIS
nTTMeo5TwkA,"SOOO WAnna watch. The words in the trailer were so dumb and unnecessary tho. ""In this farm you're the main dish"" REALLY? DIDN'T GET THAT FROM THE VISUALS ALONE AT ALL. Gah."

nTTMeo5TwkA,"This is not about vegans, it's about an evil farm, hence the slogan *Now the farm wants it is revenge* (0:38). You would guess a farm would be angry with the animals shitting and pissing on it and thankful for the people killing them, but I guess there are various farms with various behaviors. And this one wants it is revenge."

nTTMeo5TwkA,"It would be hypocrite if vegans start killing people who eat meat because even the vegans, at one point in their life, ate meat. Time is require to at least think and take a decision.

There are some people who eat meat today and later on in their life, they'll take a decision and they'll stop eating meat.

If there is 1 being who really has the right for a vendetta or revenge, it's the animals themselves (pigs, chickens, cows etc). They haven't hurt anybody and human torture them, rip them off their parents and eat them.

What if the situation was reverse? What if animals had more power than human being and start eating us throwing us to farm to be tortured and killed?

Have you ever think about that?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Okay we get it, you want us to go vegan smh"

nTTMeo5TwkA,Somewhere at this very moment a Vegan is nodding their head with a smile.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Can't decide, this is either going to go waaaay to far, or it's going to hold back and show next to nothing. Either way I bet it does nothing in the theater, subject matter will doom it. May find it's niche on streaming or home video though."
nTTMeo5TwkA,this is fkd up
nTTMeo5TwkA,Ether this is the ultemete vegan movie or the producer thinks ground meat is to expensive.

Despite how terrible most Humans are, it doesn't change the fact that you Humans are fascinating. I still have much to learn from the Human species.

TERRANCE OUT"

nTTMeo5TwkA,this seems like a cross between snuff and animal porn
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegetarians wet dream
nTTMeo5TwkA,"So horror is now only a gore fest, yeah so few and far in between horror movies this last years"
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is the real content of McDonald's burgers
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Oooohh im getting ""youre next"" vibes!! Oooohh this gon be good"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"haha at first i was like ""Shrute Farms""? then....nope nevermind"
nTTMeo5TwkA,0:54 is gay and is right out funny
nTTMeo5TwkA,WTF?!
nTTMeo5TwkA,I thought this is one of those weird pornos with an over exaggerated unnecessary plot and can be found on the weird side of tumblr
nTTMeo5TwkA,Awww look another texas chainsaw massacre
nTTMeo5TwkA,I saw the baby and that was to much man
nTTMeo5TwkA,This movie looks like its made in 2008.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Why are americans so in love with violence?
nTTMeo5TwkA,looks delicious
nTTMeo5TwkA,Leather face?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans be like
nTTMeo5TwkA,PETA movie.. they try to make u vegans
nTTMeo5TwkA,Another horrible story covered up with gore. Pointless movie.
nTTMeo5TwkA,They r copying letherface job
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Another Wrong Turn movie, this time with pig masks"
nTTMeo5TwkA,I can go for a In-n- Out burger right now
nTTMeo5TwkA,Like twisted sick version of Animal Farm.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Holly shit vroo,this vegans are serious"
nTTMeo5TwkA,story writer: PETA
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Am I the only one here like why are you not shaving them, talk about ""excuse me there's a hair in my burger"" am I rightm"
nTTMeo5TwkA,YAY vegans
nTTMeo5TwkA,DESCUSTANG
nTTMeo5TwkA,Is this that film about Mcdonald's?
nTTMeo5TwkA,vegan revenge
nTTMeo5TwkA,A vegens wet dream.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I make it a point to never, ever watch a movie where someone says: ""you don't wanna know"" because the writer was too lazy to think of an original way to skip the exposition."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Actually seems really good some where in this world people are doing this. I love torture blood and guts bring it on :)
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I SPENT 5 MONTHS ON THAT SET. THE HEAT WAS UNBEARABLE AND THE ""FOOD"" WAS NOT VERY APPEALING!"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Stupid as fuck
nTTMeo5TwkA,Well that was a nice episode of strolling through the recommend.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Masked people remind me of your next
nTTMeo5TwkA,Os veganos piram!
nTTMeo5TwkA,It's humans taking revenge against humans! Boring
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans rate this 10/10
nTTMeo5TwkA,Peta hired them
nTTMeo5TwkA,Will I see some boobs in this movie?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Really? ""THEY ATE MEAT"" That's the plot driving element?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,I guess producers were vegetarians
nTTMeo5TwkA,Get that nasty liberal out yo MOUF!!!!
nTTMeo5TwkA,If this is what vegans think actual farms do they couldn‚Äôt be more wrong most farmers treat the animal with respect if it‚Äôs killed it‚Äôs painless this is just another torture porn film
nTTMeo5TwkA,What if you are a omnivore?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks like a remake of Hotel Hell.
nTTMeo5TwkA,ATTEND THE TAIL OF SWEENEY TODD....wait wrong movie...ok
nTTMeo5TwkA,"This looks all the way fucked up, frfr"
nTTMeo5TwkA,I thought it was going to be about fields of crops and tractors. Possibly the odd combine-harvester and was disappointed it wasn't. The name of this film is stupid and I'll not be watching it. I did not see a single farmer smoking a Marlboro as he lent against the fence post he had just finished erecting and think the makers of this should get a jolly good thrashing on the bottom for misleading people. Thank you for the review as I may of ordered it and found myself infuriated by having paid for a film about farms and farming equipment only to see that dribble. Iv'e subscribed as you may of saved me much heart-ache.
nTTMeo5TwkA,I hate vegans now
nTTMeo5TwkA,*OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM EIEIO*
nTTMeo5TwkA,So this is like the movie Green Inferno yet with messed up farmers?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Interesting
nTTMeo5TwkA,I am how to basic
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Movie written and directed by Peta and Hard core Vegans.    Pass... mindless and stupid , just like eating only veggies."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Torture Porn, yaaaaaaaaawn!"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Clintons farm
nTTMeo5TwkA,The Burger's Look Better Than The Movie üòã
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
nTTMeo5TwkA,Fuckin' horror movies in 2018 be like
nTTMeo5TwkA,I hate vegans even more now.
nTTMeo5TwkA,That cage my cat could tare it apart if it wanted
nTTMeo5TwkA,I'm in
nTTMeo5TwkA,"It's hypocritical and cannibalism to eat people because they eat meat. The message the movie sends fails right from the start of the trailer. We get it, a lot of slaughterhouses don't treat animals well before killing them. Would they rather we eat them alive like other animals do in the wild?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I'm a vegan, checkmate"
nTTMeo5TwkA,The story of cannibals
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is how vegans look at us.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Is that meat U.S.D.A approved?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Why do some people think that other people want to watch shit like this? I mean anybody who has any self-decency that watches something like this will just wish they hadn't and regret it.
nTTMeo5TwkA,What sick stupid shit is this ???
nTTMeo5TwkA,I like twisted movies but the part where they‚Äôre putting a baby on the scale like they‚Äôre going to eat it is a little to far.
nTTMeo5TwkA,The sick shit people come up with no wonder  America is Fucked up
nTTMeo5TwkA,The thumbnail looks like Trump
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is a vegan cult film.   sigh....
nTTMeo5TwkA,Veganism has gone way too far!
nTTMeo5TwkA,"""They ate meat""
Already Too Preachy! *Unlike*"
nTTMeo5TwkA,1:09
nTTMeo5TwkA,This nasty very
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans.
nTTMeo5TwkA,I've been wondering when a movie like this was going to come out since 6th grade
nTTMeo5TwkA,Iiim... gonna go vegan now
nTTMeo5TwkA,stupid horrible splatter movie!!! fuck
nTTMeo5TwkA,Human Centipede all over again!
nTTMeo5TwkA,Not scary
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegan cannibals?
nTTMeo5TwkA,So a copy of Chainsaw Massacre
nTTMeo5TwkA,Rumah Dara?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Literally PETA the horror movie.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks shit
nTTMeo5TwkA,Terrorists & drug cartel gunmen could do this shit...
nTTMeo5TwkA,XD
nTTMeo5TwkA,When does it come out
nTTMeo5TwkA,Sinister porn right their!
nTTMeo5TwkA,Woah is she getting raped at 1:24
nTTMeo5TwkA,Nice
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Wow, they made a movie about Guro CG porn."
nTTMeo5TwkA,What the fuck I thought this was Back At The Barnyard
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Another psychotic family wearing weird masks terrorizing people and killing them, lets come up with something new Hollywood."
nTTMeo5TwkA,A terrible idea. Completely counterproductive to the vegan life style. And the farm wants it's revenge?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks like meats back on the menu boys üòà
nTTMeo5TwkA,Probably said already but this is such a Texas Chainsaw/Hills Have Eyes/Hostel rip-off is.
nTTMeo5TwkA,When does this release?
nTTMeo5TwkA,So the director of this movie is a vegan I'm guessing.
nTTMeo5TwkA,For some reason I'm reminded of that episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog where Courage mistake the pig couple turning their customers into meat...
nTTMeo5TwkA,I feel like this is what vegans imagine what would happen if they ate meat
nTTMeo5TwkA,peppa pig movie
nTTMeo5TwkA,Who thought by the phumbnail this was a bdsm parody lol
nTTMeo5TwkA,Of course it would be in the middle of nowhere
nTTMeo5TwkA,Oh yeah!! This movie proves y everyone should have a concealed carry permit. Guns r not the problem they r the solution.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"This would be a more edgy, inventing movie if the couple where a part of the Farm we see them commit the horrible acts on others, that would be more uncomfortable and terrifying."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"This is not a Vegan movie, Vegans eat plants, these guys are eating other humans, their cannibals, some people in the comment section need to get you vocabulary checked. Or at least take a few minutes to think before you talk or look up the words your using."
nTTMeo5TwkA,This looks great. Hope more people turn vegan after watching how it feels to be defenseless animals.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Needed guns and roses the farm for the soundtrack just ended up looking like a weird dogging weekend on pcp
nTTMeo5TwkA,WTF IS THAT  ? ? ? ?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks like a anti vegan film. Trying to make vegans look crazy.
nTTMeo5TwkA,PETA is having a heyday with shit
nTTMeo5TwkA,This movie makes NO sense it doesn't even have a proper storyline....HOW does eating meat turn into a freaking horror film?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Oh my God!!! You!!! Nooooooo! All killed in Usa??? I Can't Say How i've Most Well By Tree Had That He Low Must Give Seen for by Whats Who If and Why Did Him I  Know Sad on Feeling Must We Pareklinegn To All Male Fatally or All Female Fatally in Usans???? l'll Got He Say How Gave That Why Tell An She Back Law All of Gamleunfelpuactaqy To The All Saw by All He's Man Sear??? I Don't Woman Sear? all I Will Die??? All Kills To She Woman is Sear??? ¬¥:O
nTTMeo5TwkA,What is this the terminex revenge movie????
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Montage was not a great idea for this trailer, and the movie ain‚Äôt even original"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"they call it 'assorted' meat for a reason.. fast food for cannibals.. turning mid earth to hell.. truth, stranger than fiction, in plain sight"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Fucking vegans
nTTMeo5TwkA,Uhh... what‚Äôs the point of this..?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I think this is actually based on a shitty awareness video vegan activists made where humans are hunted, killed and butchered like animals instead of animals."
nTTMeo5TwkA,fucking vegans...
nTTMeo5TwkA,WTF!? Ok no more films from Eli Roth damn
nTTMeo5TwkA,"oh goodie, yet ANOTHER inbred, desert dwelling, shock horror movie... and here I thought Rob Zombie had cornered the market on mindless gore. Can't wait to not see it."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Crappy movie... Crappy costumes... All is shit... Human shit...
nTTMeo5TwkA,It's not a horror film it's a horrible film
nTTMeo5TwkA,Far cry 5 looks way different than I expected
nTTMeo5TwkA,Lowkey looks like Donald Trump in the thumbnail
nTTMeo5TwkA,1:04 lol
nTTMeo5TwkA,"How to start a fight in the comments
1. Comment
2. Wait a while"
nTTMeo5TwkA,your next 2
nTTMeo5TwkA,MOTEL HELL(O)??? Anyone?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans are shaking
nTTMeo5TwkA,so why are they wearing masks if theyre gonna kill them anyways ?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"In the US, 
You eat the animals. 
   In SOVIET RUSSIA, 
THE ANIMALS EAT YOU"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Actually pretty nasty but since all originality is gone in Hollywood they have to rely on torture porn movies like this.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans be like.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I remember this movie when it was ""Motel Hell""."
nTTMeo5TwkA,I just commented because I thought the chick in the thumbnail was hot and wanted to make sure that the feminists were also as offended as the animal rights people.
nTTMeo5TwkA,USDA approved...?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Because vegans are scary.
nTTMeo5TwkA,que pelicula mas satanica y basura
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Though the idea is disturbing, I feel like the concept has already been done thousands of times. One of the good things I like in this trailer was the style, it is very similar to that of 70s horror or grindhouse films."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"This is why I want to be vegan, people okay?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans are dumb because their brain don't receive all the nutrients.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Dont give VEGANS ideas.  They are so wierd that they might actually do this!
nTTMeo5TwkA,Erick Rowan's family lol
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks like peta was behind the making of this film.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Plants cry out in pain when they are killed. Is the difference because they don‚Äôt have brainstems? Because the brainstem is the most delicious part. All things being equal, if I‚Äôm going to inflict pain for my meal, I‚Äôll still take the bacon over a salad."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"that's it, I'm eating fish from now on"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Well.  That was...interesting.
nTTMeo5TwkA,THEY ATE MEAT :O
nTTMeo5TwkA,That shit is fucking crazy
nTTMeo5TwkA,La Venganza de los Veganos ?? Xd
nTTMeo5TwkA,The Wyatt family lore is getting weird!
nTTMeo5TwkA,Rotten tomatoes 4 percent
nTTMeo5TwkA,"This is based off a real event

There was this one person who opened up a burger joint, instead of using the normal beat you use he would kill people and use their meat in the burgers"
nTTMeo5TwkA,They learned this from meat butchers they were first ... Now they just want to survive ... Fighting back ...
nTTMeo5TwkA,"So, Texas Chainsaw Massacre?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,No
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegan movie producers got together to try and gross normal ppl out of eating meat.
nTTMeo5TwkA,This looks like a genuinely fucked up movie. That‚Äôs a Fucking baby being put on weighing scales!
nTTMeo5TwkA,Truly fucking stupid
nTTMeo5TwkA,Lol the Credits! Alec Gaylord.... is this real? XD
nTTMeo5TwkA,*moo*
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans
nTTMeo5TwkA,This movie will flop.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Clinton spirit cooking advert ?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Interesting concept

But..I'm not really into it."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Relatives of Leatherface.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans after you keep talking about their grass
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegas made this film
nTTMeo5TwkA,My dog is smarter than her
nTTMeo5TwkA,These horror movies are so stupid
nTTMeo5TwkA,Director of this has made peta adverts in the past. Taking things to the extreme now i see
nTTMeo5TwkA,lmfao
nTTMeo5TwkA,Is this a fetish or something
nTTMeo5TwkA,Is this a squeal to your next
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Well basically these people now know what a farm animal goes threw...




Even if I support PETA I can totally see PETA doin this"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"So basically, Motel Hell with a bit of Texas Chainsaw Massacre"
nTTMeo5TwkA,The thumbnail looks like someone is giving a blowjob to the cow.
nTTMeo5TwkA,1:09 Dibs on the booty
nTTMeo5TwkA,Were u at
nTTMeo5TwkA,1:00 I just hope it's not a true baby
nTTMeo5TwkA,When is it out to see
nTTMeo5TwkA,Epic Vegan Comeback.
nTTMeo5TwkA,this is on my download list! love the clip at 1:09 wow
nTTMeo5TwkA,Wyatt Family: The Movie
nTTMeo5TwkA,Not going to theaters.....
nTTMeo5TwkA,"The horror factor disappears completely to me when I notice this has a 99% probability of being some kind of ridiculous vegetarian propaganda disguised as a horror movie. Nice try, but you won't convince me with this kind of bullshit. (^_^)"
nTTMeo5TwkA,I always knew PETA was a bunch of cannibals
nTTMeo5TwkA,"What happened to horror films that were entertaining?  These types of horrors are not scary or frighting, they're more grotesque and depressing relying on shock value alone, That's not what I want from a movie. A big miss for me."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Technically when they cooked those people the hair shouldve fried off ... just saying.
nTTMeo5TwkA,This looks Terrible. Anybody who likes this will like anything they see on the internet.
nTTMeo5TwkA,I think this is supposed to be a message to kill vegans....
nTTMeo5TwkA,No offense that is totally stupid because they're copying off Devil's Rejects a bunch of people eating people already been done before Rob Zombie no offense that is totally stupid because they're hopping off Devil's Rejects a bunch of people eat and people already been done before Rob zombie if you can hear this man copyright man copyright
nTTMeo5TwkA,Texas Chainsaw Massacre (part 2) meets The Hills Have Eyes (remake) meets the Family with assorted militant vegan/Christians are crazy narratives as a garnish. Pass.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Even the manga The Promised Neverland is better than this farce. It talks about 'farms' too.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Look out, the farm wants it is revenge! The revenge is releasing another generic interchangeable gore-fest into an already over-saturated market! Saturated... *with BLOOD*!"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Well that movie looks retarded
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I love a good horror movie but this looks stupid. This kind of movie has been beat to death. Im tired of the chainsaw massacre style, crazy inbred hillbilly movies. Wheres the innovation? And isnt funny how all the psycho's in movies like this are always white people? Well actually I guess that makes sense cuz every inbred I have ever seen was a white person. White people are fucked up. And im a white dude saying that."
nTTMeo5TwkA,WHHHYYYY!!!!!! :(
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans gonna love this lol
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Damn PETA, you need to chill the fuck out"
nTTMeo5TwkA,The looks like a very turn on movie
nTTMeo5TwkA,I'll have the fish please.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"This looks goofy, but at least the music‚Äôs good."
nTTMeo5TwkA,I love the fact it has a Red Lobster banner underneath the trailer.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Soooooo cannibal Hannibal farm animal cosplayers?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I watched this while eating, I got myself even more food."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Wonder if the meat is organic
nTTMeo5TwkA,I'm all good
nTTMeo5TwkA,I wonder what kind of growth hormones they use in their meat?
nTTMeo5TwkA,You know horror movies have gone to shit when they use masks that you can find at party city.
nTTMeo5TwkA,wow another stupid horror movie
nTTMeo5TwkA,I'm vegan! üòàüòàüòà
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Oh, what the hell are they never ending to squeeze out those shitty movies?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"wow... hollywood has really run out of ideas, huh?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Unge bist du es?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Are they really releasing this movie
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is crazy
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Estas pel√≠culas nunca las deber√≠an de filmar,es darle alas sueltas a las mentes malignas y sin piedad."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Wow, a movie about EXACTLY what it's like to be an animal in the agricultural industry. Perfect. Too bad most will just talk trash about vegans and have no real critical thought regarding any positive message that could be taken from this."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Thank god I am veg
nTTMeo5TwkA,Oh wow
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Let me guess, the director is vegan"
nTTMeo5TwkA,The acting needs work.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Vegan power, seriously so if I eat meat these Texas chainsaw ripoffs are gonna kill me"
nTTMeo5TwkA,This was definitely made by a vegan
nTTMeo5TwkA,Meh
nTTMeo5TwkA,The vegan feel-good movie of the year.
nTTMeo5TwkA,I guess lean hog and cattle basis totally shit the bed.
nTTMeo5TwkA,"A movie about saving animals?
The Vegans are taking over!
*im an adult virgin*"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Gruesome. Not for me
nTTMeo5TwkA,You're Next meets Leatherface
nTTMeo5TwkA,Produced by rob zombie and co produced by Adam Sandler
nTTMeo5TwkA,I have ever seen the pig's mask.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Most fucked up shit I have ever seen
nTTMeo5TwkA,These movie loookels poorly made
nTTMeo5TwkA,R we really trying to make vegans scary?
nTTMeo5TwkA,I thought the thumbnail was Epstein's Pedo island. The Clintons favorite vacation spot for pedovores and pedophiles.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Is this supposed to be a twisted sadistic version of George Orwells Animal Farm??
nTTMeo5TwkA,I'm tired of these bullshit films
nTTMeo5TwkA,I didn‚Äôt know Eric Rowan was in this film
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks fake...
nTTMeo5TwkA,How many horror movies start with a couple driving in the middle of nowhere
nTTMeo5TwkA,"‚ÄúThey ate meat‚Äù
Vegans: Oh my god!"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Oh boy.....another movie about a couple of stupid morons driving through a hick town in the middle of no-where USA.  DO THEY NOT HAVE GPS ON THEIR PHONES??? I'm guessing in the movie parallel dimension they don't have horror movies and people are just plain stupid.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Oh boy.....another movie about a couple of stupid morons driving through a hick town in the middle of no-where USA.  DO THEY NOT HAVE GPS ON THEIR PHONES??? I'm guessing in the movie parallel dimension they don't have horror movies and people are just plain stupid.

nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks like a PETA vegan torture porn
nTTMeo5TwkA,"The masks look like the movie ""You're Next"""
nTTMeo5TwkA,Vegans Want Their Revenge By Turning Them Into Meat For Eating Meat... *Claps*
nTTMeo5TwkA,1:00 Baby Back Ribs!!!!!!
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I'm getting the vibe of cannibals, insane inbreeds, and maybe a cult?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Well that's sick...
nTTMeo5TwkA,Wow I didn‚Äôt think Hollywood could get any lower I was sooo wrong stop with the horror movies until u do some damn good ones
nTTMeo5TwkA,Look like they took a wrong turn by the cabin in the woods where the hill have eyes!
nTTMeo5TwkA,So this is what happened to the Wyatt family?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"1:09 This seems more porn than horror . . . . although it was only a matter of time, considering what non-blumhouse horror films have been doing for years."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Not a patch on Texas chainsaw massacre
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Indie horror movies makers should try to make their movies scary and creepy rather than just make it based on shock value, that‚Äôs all this is, there‚Äôs nothing scary, just the taboo subjects shock people"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Welcome to the family son lol
nTTMeo5TwkA,This movie is trash and ridiculous I'm not seeing this for shit and why ARE THEY KILLING BABY'S WTF

nTTMeo5TwkA,Das nasty
nTTMeo5TwkA,"As long as somebody gets dismembered by a power tool of some sort in the first 20 minutes, then I'm good.  Maybe a hand saw.  Cannibalism, ehhh, been there done that got the shirt, but I'm always a sucker for a good power tool dismemberment scene.  practical effects by the way none of the CGI crap."

nTTMeo5TwkA,I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times already
nTTMeo5TwkA,Mmm... Roast hooman.
nTTMeo5TwkA,What's up with this cannabilism horror shit.

nTTMeo5TwkA,"The Farm...... brought to you, by the Wyatt Family. (WWE fans should get this)"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Hollywood go home you're drunk
nTTMeo5TwkA,This movie seems so ridiculous and disgusting. How can someone spend money to that cheap film? And what is that? Vegan's revenge? A bad copy of Texas Chainsaw
nTTMeo5TwkA,A rip-off of The Hills Have Eyes and The Hills Have Eyes 2?
nTTMeo5TwkA,">_> just stupid, if they made the cages legit i would of said ok cool, but i have broken out of many cages ummm for science and that shit is easy to do. That or i am just a social path lol like dexter."
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Ok, who allowed peta to make a movie?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,My Pomeranian can get out of that cage
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is crazy!  PETA making a movie this soon after one of their members shot up YouTube???  And this is posted on YouTube?  Ironic!
nTTMeo5TwkA,Wonderful viewing NOT!!..
nTTMeo5TwkA,So...they worship Eric Rowan ? ;)
nTTMeo5TwkA,Next Year: The Farm: Part 2 - Old McDonalds Revenge
nTTMeo5TwkA,White culture
nTTMeo5TwkA,So saw but instead of a generic plot its replaced with vegans... Not sure which is worse to be honest.
nTTMeo5TwkA,How can people like this?
nTTMeo5TwkA,No black folks were killed during this movie. Ha ha ha we're safe this time
nTTMeo5TwkA,The Bunny the Bear?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Texas chainsaw massacre 2 with more people and no chainsaws. Chili contest
nTTMeo5TwkA,This remind of the Simpons tree house of horror.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Gross
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I remember when a good guy shot the bad guy, they just fell down, no blood, no guts, no graphic close ups of people being horribly mutilated. This psychotic savagery fills the need of degenerate, voyeur, cretins who demand more and more to satisfy their cravings.
The mere fact that this movie and others like it, are allowed to be made and shown in this country, is all the proof you need that we are doomed."
nTTMeo5TwkA,What is scary is that some vegans would let this happen ü§£ But yhey would have to boast about it so they definatly would get caught ‚úåüèæ
nTTMeo5TwkA,It's vegan ?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"""Wants ITS revenge""... Not ""it's"". And that stroboscopic montage doesn't look good either"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"I really Like the overall idea of people being traped at a farm and be treated Like pigs or cows. With a big budget and famous actors, i believe it would become very good.
But sadly this looks Just cheap."
nTTMeo5TwkA,History buyer acquisition covzb delivery simple portion dare movement
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks very bad. Thats  not horror thats just sick
nTTMeo5TwkA,Must see! When can I see it?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Hate these movies they encourage cannibalism
nTTMeo5TwkA,gross
nTTMeo5TwkA,Seems unsanitary.  You have no idea how many kinds of diseases women today have.  Just for pragmatic reasons I wouldn't eat human even if I were a cannibal for some reason.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Goldrake warned us about the Vegans!
nTTMeo5TwkA,When the vegan start to identify themselves as a cattle
nTTMeo5TwkA,This isn't a horror movie vegans just be like this sometimes
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks like a bad version of Texas chainsaw.
nTTMeo5TwkA,üçóüíÄ  no ?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"did i see ""gaylord"" in the credit part?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Pigs  oven ready  at 6-7 months
Humans 15 years?
not a profit making option really."
nTTMeo5TwkA,Wow how unoriginal just plain weird feels like bunch inbreeding retards.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Motel Hell on steroids or Vegans gone Wild.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Sorry I only eat certified organic homosapien.
nTTMeo5TwkA,The lamb from you're next :0
nTTMeo5TwkA,Yeah looks like it was directed by Nasim AghdamüôÑ
nTTMeo5TwkA,This looks so stupid.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Old Crazy Hillary had a farm
nTTMeo5TwkA,It it halal?
nTTMeo5TwkA,Sorry but I only eat free range human
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is how a slaughter house works. It is sad that this only bothers you when its humans that are the food.
nTTMeo5TwkA,It looks ridiculous
nTTMeo5TwkA,erhmmm...getting hungry... roasted beef sound good...yum
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Nah, didnt even get chills"
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Que clase de masacre en Texas es esto "" jaja ;)"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Is this a vegan movie?
nTTMeo5TwkA,"HA, and there it is. F**king cannibal movie.  Torture porn, Backwoods inbreed hicks in pig masks, and  that blink and you'll miss it, but not really, because its the thumbnail, scene with the people looking like roasted pigs. Now all we need is that last shock moment when you think they got away and.....OMG, WHAT'S LEFT OF OUR MAIN CHARACTERS IS HANGING IN A MEAT LOCKER...OOOOH MY GOOOOOD !!!  Cause, ya know, gotta tick those boxes, right ?"
nTTMeo5TwkA,Do NOT mess with vegans
nTTMeo5TwkA,Anybody that can't get themselves out of a fucking dog kennel doesn't deserve to live.
nTTMeo5TwkA,That was really disturbing!
nTTMeo5TwkA,So this place is run by vegans taking ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù on meat eaters? Lol
nTTMeo5TwkA,C‚Äôest quoi ce film Putain ?üòÇüòÇ
nTTMeo5TwkA,"Ha ha ha revenge for the sweet deer,pigs ,cows and everything else humans think they need to torture so they can be fucking gluttons love this shit,people need to realize that when we get gunned down at a school or a movie theatre or at our work place and we mourn over it and god don't get me wrong its terrible and it shouldn't happen,but think this is what these poor animals go through every day waiting to be slaughtered!"
nTTMeo5TwkA,So vegans take revenge? Ok how is that scary? Vegans are malnourished
nTTMeo5TwkA,Looks like absolute garbage
nTTMeo5TwkA,why are SOOO many movies coming out this year about cannibals? oh thats right. Hollywood has no originality or intelligence anymore.....ehhhhh
nTTMeo5TwkA,Sinistro! üò∞
nTTMeo5TwkA,This is really ticking all the generic horror buttons isn't it.
nTTMeo5TwkA,Ok they are weighing a baby....thats fucked up...i hate movies like this...
nTTMeo5TwkA,I wonder how could get out of this very thin crafted cage... what happen if I just stand up?
nTTMeo5TwkA,I hope no dark ending
nTTMeo5TwkA,PETA activists
nTTMeo5TwkA,Old Mc Donald had a farm

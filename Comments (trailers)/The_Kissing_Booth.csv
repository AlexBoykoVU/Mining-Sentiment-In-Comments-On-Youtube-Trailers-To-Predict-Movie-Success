7bfS6seiLhk,This is like the 10+ time I’ve watched this.😂
7bfS6seiLhk,not going to lie the only thing I like about the trailer was the ford mustang lol
7bfS6seiLhk,The song
7bfS6seiLhk,That's a nice house
7bfS6seiLhk,WOW I HOPE THEY INCLUDE THE SCENE WHERE SHE GETS PREGNANT AND HAS A MISCARRIAGE BECAUSE A LIBRARY SHELF FELL ON HER IN AN EARTHQUAKE
7bfS6seiLhk,"Was I the only one who noticed the big jar of (what I assume to be) Vaseline and the magazine under the bed,on the last scene?? No?? Ok, I’m just gonna go then... 😂😂😂"

7bfS6seiLhk,I remember reading this on Wattpad and I was SHOOK when I saw the book in Chapters stores! I'm even more SHOOK now that it's a film!! Beth (the author) has come so far it's insane!
7bfS6seiLhk,I wish that every like good book from Wattpad had a chance to become either a movie or a tv-show or series. That would be so awesome because some books for me really deserve that. So please someone MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!
7bfS6seiLhk,It’s sad everybody knows the mom from Riverdale and not Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club 🤦🏽‍♀️
7bfS6seiLhk,More like Joey Queen 😍👑 I love her
7bfS6seiLhk,"Kind of ""No list kiss"""
7bfS6seiLhk,you will always be our little ol' rory in our hearts
7bfS6seiLhk,Thinks back to Romona And Besus
7bfS6seiLhk,Anyone else see the magazine and lube at the end

7bfS6seiLhk,"LOL, the height difference reminds me of my fiance and I. I'm so short and he's quite tall. XD This looks like one of those teen rom coms from the 90s. The only thing I'm impressed with is the solid friendship the main girl has with her best guy friend. It's rare to see a movie where two best friends of the opposite sex don't end up together, so that aspect alone is quite refreshing."
7bfS6seiLhk,"Seems kind of dumb, but also kind of cute! XOXO ;)"
7bfS6seiLhk,Wow Ramona is getting older now😄
7bfS6seiLhk,Well Ramona is all grown up
7bfS6seiLhk,"So here's the cliche, El has a crush on her best friends' hot brother, but the best friend pretty much has a crush on her,"
7bfS6seiLhk,Cringe
7bfS6seiLhk,Wow
7bfS6seiLhk,This is so sweet💕
7bfS6seiLhk,"This has a terrible message js, screw over ya friend for sex basically regardless of gender you don’t break bros before hoes"
7bfS6seiLhk,I AM SO WATCHING THIS
7bfS6seiLhk,Is it just be or is the best friend cute too...
7bfS6seiLhk,He’s her real-life boyfriend they’re goals 😭🙌
7bfS6seiLhk,"Hot guy, with quirky ""kinda/unconventional"" beautiful girl... Matchmake in heaven"
7bfS6seiLhk,"rich white kids im supposed to care about... but i don't, so i'll pass."
7bfS6seiLhk,Am I the only one who thinks this is so much like Naomi & Ely's No Kiss List
7bfS6seiLhk,I have a crush on my best friends brother
7bfS6seiLhk,how many tropes can they fit into one movie? plus finn isn’t even that hot tf.
7bfS6seiLhk,"She is like the cutest, shortest, most alive girl 😊😊"
7bfS6seiLhk,I'm sorry but what a bitch I feel sorry for her best friend if I were him I'd feel so betrayed id shoot myself
7bfS6seiLhk,I just love stranger things
7bfS6seiLhk,"I've read the book and the idea that I have in mind about the story, characters, their life style and other stuff it was totally different. I don't know I guess that for me the book is more mature than the this movie."
7bfS6seiLhk,Anyone else seen Ramona and beezus
7bfS6seiLhk,Wait wasn't this on wattpad along time ago...
7bfS6seiLhk,Damn is that Ramona!? 😱

7bfS6seiLhk,christ this looks s***
7bfS6seiLhk,Holy sh*t.
7bfS6seiLhk,I still remember when Joey King replied to my tweet.
7bfS6seiLhk,"Of all the really good books on Wattpad its disappointing that this one that is clearly lame as hell, became a 'best seller' in the real world tbh."
7bfS6seiLhk,What's the song at 1:25 ?
7bfS6seiLhk,WATTTPADDDDDD 💝💝💝💝💝

7bfS6seiLhk,This was in Wattpad
7bfS6seiLhk,So this was the book I read on wattpad months ago? They pushed it to theaters. Wow!
7bfS6seiLhk,"This script isn't gud ,,I really hate whn someone comes in between besstees"
7bfS6seiLhk,Is that the girl from Taylor Swift's Mean video lol
7bfS6seiLhk,https://youtu.be/y79VPjqtnI0
7bfS6seiLhk,"2:20

7bfS6seiLhk,*this I'd kinda the edge of the 17*
7bfS6seiLhk,This looks amazing. I can't wait for it to come out xxx
7bfS6seiLhk,"So, who exactly counts as critics? And what counts as a best selling novel?"
7bfS6seiLhk,Ramona grew up
7bfS6seiLhk,Bruh. The petroleum jelly under his bed though.
7bfS6seiLhk,"Now,this looks like a genuine concept .....Netflix is giving so much great content !!"
7bfS6seiLhk,Stranger things 🌹
7bfS6seiLhk,I’m sorry but the height difference is HILARIOUS 🤣
7bfS6seiLhk,I remember reading this on wattpad and being PISSED when they took it down so it could be published 🤣
7bfS6seiLhk,Okay I have seen this trailer so many times but did anyone notice the petroleum jelly under Flynns bed
7bfS6seiLhk,priority affair humor war dance variety academic monthly machine.
7bfS6seiLhk,LoL 😂 I can't wait
7bfS6seiLhk,I honestly wish she’d just get with her friend :( it would be so much less cliche)
7bfS6seiLhk,"Wait, so she broke rule number 9 and 10?"
7bfS6seiLhk,Comments: “if she ends up with him/the brother/by herself it’s too predictable”. LOL.  Only unpredictable outcome would be if she died.  Geez.
7bfS6seiLhk,"The girl looks thirteen, the guy looks thirty."
7bfS6seiLhk,I absolutely love Joel Courtney!!
7bfS6seiLhk,this started on wattpad and now its a big time movie! woooo 🙌

7bfS6seiLhk,Please make More Black Lightning seasons
7bfS6seiLhk,I love how Jeremy Gilbert from tvd is in this 😍😍😍
7bfS6seiLhk,The friend zone is too mush in this
7bfS6seiLhk,I'm probably gonna watch this if only for the fact that it's a guilty pleasure of mine to watch cheesy cliché romcoms and mock them endlessly whilst doing so.
7bfS6seiLhk,This girl has never aged
7bfS6seiLhk,I want her to be with her best friend. They probably will end up together.
7bfS6seiLhk,im excited for this 💛
7bfS6seiLhk,cant wait I remember when I read the book it actually seems a lot like it so Im excited
7bfS6seiLhk,"Call it cliché or whatever but I'm still anticipating it's release. Being an avid reader of wattpad, I'm extremely proud of the author. (Although, I haven't read this particular book yet) What an amazing achievement! 🖤"
7bfS6seiLhk,So watching this
7bfS6seiLhk,He is way older than her
7bfS6seiLhk,I already love this!!! 😍
7bfS6seiLhk,"This trailer is pure perfection! I'm so excited to watch this movie on Friday! Great job, Beth, Komixx, Netflix, and everyone involved! Seriously! Brilliant job! :)"
7bfS6seiLhk,Whats the name of the song that came at the end?
7bfS6seiLhk,"They crammed the whole movie into 2:43, impressive."
7bfS6seiLhk,Follow your heart boys and girls and gentlemen haha.
7bfS6seiLhk,I would honestly like to know who is hitting the like button on this video
7bfS6seiLhk,"Shes *supposed* to look stoned in the thumbnail, right?"
7bfS6seiLhk,background song name please anyone ?
7bfS6seiLhk,OHMAGAHD IT'S RAMONA
7bfS6seiLhk,My first book I read on Wattpad! How did they not mention it’s from the app? Tbh very very very disappointed in how this looks :( nothing like I pictured the book
7bfS6seiLhk,Her brother and the boy ( not her best friend) look so alike
7bfS6seiLhk,Looks terribly cliché.
7bfS6seiLhk,I don't know about the book but her best friend seems cuter.
7bfS6seiLhk,"Is she the girl in the music video ""Mean"" by Taylor Swift ?"
7bfS6seiLhk,seems gay
7bfS6seiLhk,Noah is so tall.
7bfS6seiLhk,God this looks awful
7bfS6seiLhk,Figured at 1:37 they'd break out in '16 Going on 17'.
7bfS6seiLhk,the last scene tho xD
7bfS6seiLhk,"Ramona baby, what is you doing"
7bfS6seiLhk,I can't tell the difference between the two boys
7bfS6seiLhk,he looks 25
7bfS6seiLhk,Her and her friend hookup in the end your welcome
7bfS6seiLhk,"No.. no ... noooo. The kissing booth has always been one of my all time favorite books not because it’s fantastically written (although yes it really was) but because it was cheesy and sweet in all the right ways and shows how strong of a friendship both Elle and lee have continued to have throughout their lives. Although this book is about her relationship with Noah, that’s not the main topic of the story the book is about how important her friendship with lee is aaaaaand her new relationship! I have always wished their would be a movie remake of this book bc as I’ve stated it has been one of my go to’s over the years anytime I needed to just smile and laugh. This is why I’m so upset with this trailer bc it ALREADY shows how much they’ve changed from the book
1) there are NO RULES in their friendship 
2) lee has always been fine with her crush on Noah through the years, he just finds it gross
3) she doesn’t do sports 
4) while I do like the actress that is laying her bc she is a good actress, she looks far to young, they make it look like Elle is some little freshman who gets with a senior when in reality she is a junior and although shorter than Noah she is around the same height, what I’m trying to say is this actress is far to young to be playing Elle correctly 
5) he doesn’t make fun of her for her lack of dating bc he’s the reason why and he knows it
6) they make Noah seem more carefree and go with the flow instead of being the “overprotective violence junkie”(anyone who’s actually read the book and isn’t just fangirling over how attractive the guys are or over the actresses know this reference) towards Elle and everyone else (although the overprotectiveness is geared directly towards Elle bc that’s how he is with her) that anyone who has actually read the book knows and loves 
7) there is no mention of Rachel anywhere in this trailer 
8) there is no brad or her father or the mention of her mother at all
9) although they show lee and Elle hanging out it portrays Elle as if she hangs out with girls as friends a lot 
10) where are the guys!!!! There is no mention of cam or Dixon or any other of the guys, Elle is the type of girl who spends all her time with lee, thus meaning she hangs out with guy friends a heck of a lot more
11) Elle makes it very clear up to the point of the day of the kissing booth that she does not like Noah and tells the girls at school that he doesn’t want to go to the booth not making promises that he “definitely will” 
12)  lastly, and most importantly is the the relationship between Elle and Noah leading up to them dating and even after while they are, they are not friendly, in fact they can not stand each other most often and any conversation usually ends in fighting 
13). I lied, where is the big fight cuz that little argument where he’s asking her if anything is going on definitely does not cut it
14) there is NO LOVE TOWARDS THE MOTORCYCLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At alllllllllll (honestly that’s upsetting me so much how she is screaming in joy instead of anger from being on it)
SOOOOOOOOOO yeah I am DEFINITELY not happy with this trailer at ALL!"
7bfS6seiLhk,This looks so fucking simple but i am HERE FOR IT. ❤️ The boys look way too similar though from what i can tell.
7bfS6seiLhk,I would give it a like... but I'm Mad at Netflix
7bfS6seiLhk,WATTPAD
7bfS6seiLhk,I feel like Netflix's main focus is the horny teenagers who'd watch stuff with titles like this
7bfS6seiLhk,Second song?!
7bfS6seiLhk,What's the name of the song that's in this trailer??
7bfS6seiLhk,This is my jam
7bfS6seiLhk,She’s beautiful
7bfS6seiLhk,Whatta cut👏 a English movie trailer without lip lock 👌😂
7bfS6seiLhk,That is the mom of archie from riverdale
7bfS6seiLhk,Typical SLUT
7bfS6seiLhk,I love Joey!
7bfS6seiLhk,It's like they purposely made it look awful.
7bfS6seiLhk,Watchinnnng
7bfS6seiLhk,Omg shes so big.. just remembered her saying “GUTSS??!!!” In Ramona and Beezuz.. 😂😂
7bfS6seiLhk,"I like netflix, they show you the whole movie in all of their trailers."
7bfS6seiLhk,is this a series or a movie?! answerr plss
7bfS6seiLhk,god this looks so cliche and dumb. go figure since the book was on wattpad
7bfS6seiLhk,Whack
7bfS6seiLhk,Wow the Romeo and Juliet laws sure do come in handy nowadays 😂😂😂
7bfS6seiLhk,This movie is going to be big
7bfS6seiLhk,"Thank YOU, Netflix!"
7bfS6seiLhk,I am here for this movie
7bfS6seiLhk,I need to see that movie ❤️
7bfS6seiLhk,I wanna see it
7bfS6seiLhk,at the ending there was Archie's mum!!!🤣
7bfS6seiLhk,The ending is cute😊
7bfS6seiLhk,this looks like it was made for baby teenagers but with adults actors and a plot that just seems very predictable...
7bfS6seiLhk,I love this!
7bfS6seiLhk,Is that logan paul?
7bfS6seiLhk,CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS 😍😘
7bfS6seiLhk,THE TITLE SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR THEN I WENT THROUGH THE COMMENTS AND SAW THAT THE BOOK OF THIS MOVIE WAS FIRST PUBLISHED ON WATTPAD. NOW I KNOW WHERE I MUST HAVE SEEN IT.
7bfS6seiLhk,That’s the girl from White House down
7bfS6seiLhk,Is that jackson from kkandbabyj? On 0.19?
7bfS6seiLhk,This is...the most generic crap I've ever seen. Why is this going to be another thing to add to the pile of shitty movies that have already been made?
7bfS6seiLhk,This boy is soo fucking hot.. 🔥🔥
7bfS6seiLhk,Damn! She’s Hot! 😱😍🔥💯
7bfS6seiLhk,lmao who remembers her in Ramona and Beezus
7bfS6seiLhk,@ 2:17 looks like he hid his....... 😂😂😂
7bfS6seiLhk,shes a 15 year old (14 year old freshman) and hes 26 uhhhh
7bfS6seiLhk,Naomi and Ely's No Kiss List???
7bfS6seiLhk,Is this same chick who was little girl  in taylor swift Mean video
7bfS6seiLhk,Damsel babe........
7bfS6seiLhk,"is it just me or are they making alot of movies in the same type of style and its really annoying like every trailer has the same background songs same as the movies  the actors are good just scripts can be over dramatic and nobody is bitchy anymore why do you think like every movie that came out in 2000s where so addictive even if they where cheesy we still loved them all like mean girls all the bring it ons those movies you watch 10000 times but never get tired of

and im sorry but netflix is making way to many shows and movies like ive just stopped going on there cause everyday they got like 5 new shows and we really dont need so many i would rather 3-4 really good shows with alot of budget and funny script then 300 cheesy movies,shows that we click off after 20 mins  .they are thinking about quantity over quality"
7bfS6seiLhk,"There is literally no plot in this movie, didn't know it could be possible, but they made it happen."
7bfS6seiLhk,Did it already come out on Netflix
7bfS6seiLhk,Omg yessss I loved this watt pad story

So pointy 😂😂"
7bfS6seiLhk,"*barfs all over this endless pile of coming of age tropes (most of which are idiotic things only the shallow, ""popular"" kiddies would relate to) and cliches*

Hey, it actually looks a bit better swimming in my breakfast bile!

Shame on Netflix for once again green lighting garbage. Seriously, you have the money, talent, and clout to make independent productions that are sharp, edgy, new, and intelligent (Spectral is a good example off the top of my head - so is Stranger Things). Yet, what do you do, waste time and money catering to the lowest common denominator of bimbo viewers. What is next, taking the reins of 50 Shades of Grey and churning out a bunch of softcore porn sequels for insufferable housewives not worth their wedding vows?

Leave the shit storylines for direct to DVD market and book section at Walmart. Movies are supposed to be a powerful medium in which to tell evocative stories - not dazzle simple minds with bright colors, cutesie-wootsie music, and shallow TERRIBLE actors with abs."
7bfS6seiLhk,I read it : kissing boobs.
7bfS6seiLhk,....her name is l ?

7bfS6seiLhk,Girls do like boys ass😒😒😒😒🔥

7bfS6seiLhk,Is this available in every country?
7bfS6seiLhk,Oh she broke the rule.....Girls always do.

Everyone else in LA struggles and it keeps getting more expensive. They can't afford to live in giant houses on the hills overlooking the city. It's also like 60% Hispanic, mainly from Mexico, not a bunch of 6'6"" buff white dudes."
7bfS6seiLhk,best friend finds out.. gets angry cuz he secretly liked her this whole time... then she ends up with her bestfriend.. the end.

7bfS6seiLhk,Can you name the song pls
7bfS6seiLhk,"Here's the review of the book 
.
    The Kissing Booth is a quick and quite enjoyable summer read that kept me well entertained for a couple of days. I wouldn't call it memorable or game-changing, but it was definitely cute and sunny, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys teen angst, secret love affairs and overly dramatic female characters. 

     This book reminded me a lot of Beautiful Disaster by Jaime McGuire and I think anyone who is looking for a more YA-friendly version of that book (tamer, more cutesy) will definitely enjoy The Kissing Booth. Like Beautiful Disaster, this book has a cocky and controlling guy, a sweet and naive girl (who, of course, doesn't realize how hot she actually is), and lots and lots of drama. There's passion, kissing, fooling around and even some sex. There's sneaking around, lying, breaking up and reconciling. And a whole lot of acting stupid and irrational. The only difference is that The Kissing Booth has a better ending that redeems some of that stupid and irrational stuff that goes down in the second half of the book, leaving the reader slightly more satisfied (still pretty frustrated, though). 

     Personally, I wasn't a fan of Beautiful Disaster at all and, sadly, there were things about The Kissing Booth that annoyed me just as much. For instance, there is nothing I hate more than cocky, controlling, border-line abusive love-interests, and while Noah isn't as horrible as Travis, he is still far from perfect. Overprotective, stubborn, jealous and possessive, Noah frequently behave in a way that made me cringe and shake my head in disgust. He tells Rochelle what she should wear and who she should or shouldn't talk to, and makes sure that no other boy ever flirts with her or even looks at her in a *funny* way (as in: expressing interest). He scares off potential boyfriends and throws punches whenever someone makes an inappropriate joke - even when Rochelle herself is provoking and then enjoying the jokes. The weirdest thing is, he's been doing all that for years before they even got together (a silent stalker sneaking around in the shadows?). I couldn't stand him. To me, he was spoiled, selfish and childish, and I hated how he would use the same excuse over and over again to rationalize his erratic behaviour (""I'm only looking out for you""). 

     Rochelle frustrated me even more. Her behaviour didn't make much sense either. She would go on insisting that they keep their relationship secret from everyone (including her best friend and Noah's brother, Lee), and when the truth finally came out, she turned the situation around and blamed Noah for everything. She was all innocent and goody-goody, but didn't mind sneaking around with Noah and having sex before making their relationship known to the public. 

     The ending itself caught me by surprise. I expected Noah and Rochelle to finally get together and make it official, and then adjust their plans for the future accordingly. I swear, I thought these two would make a decision to go to the same school or do something even more drastic, just to stay together. Instead, what we got was sort of a ""whatever will be, will be"" ending. Both of them decided to put their education/career first (which is the mature thing to do), and they agreed to wait and see where life will take them. Considering everything that happened prior to that, I must say I was very surprised, but kind of happy with that ending. It was a realistic ending with a good message, and I appreciated that. 

     All things considered, The Kissing Booth was a good book. Emotionally engaging, at times quite heart-pounding and definitely entertaining. A great summer read to enjoy on the beach, with a glass of ice tea on the side. If you're looking for something fun and hot, but not necessarily intellectually stimulating or demanding, this might be the book for you. If, however, you're bothered by unrealistically depicted relationships, weirdly motivated behaviours and superficial, cliched characters, it might be best to stir clear off it."

The woman will seemingly appear in anything, and I mean ANYTHING, for a paycheck. Riverdale, Jem and the Holograms, The Secret Life of the American Teenager, King Cobra, a Christmas movie on Lifetime... and that's just in the past few years. She's even engaged in a rap battle with Jon Cryer! It's a shame she's fallen so hard. But hey, at least we have Eric's sister, Julia, right?

7bfS6seiLhk,"Wow, that was cringey."

7bfS6seiLhk,That looks good
7bfS6seiLhk,"I was gonna say this seems like a nice cheesy predictable teen rom-com to watch with girl friends on movie night, maybe watch some classic 80's rom-coms like Sixteen Candles...and then freakin Molly Ringwald actually pops up there at the end as the dude's mom 😂😂😂"
7bfS6seiLhk,dude got cucked by brother LUL

7bfS6seiLhk,That was a really short movie wtf
7bfS6seiLhk,"She's following something, not her heart haha"
7bfS6seiLhk,"Like sure this is cute as a little YA novel but did it really need to be made into a movie? some things don't translate from page to screen. This just seems trite and completely void of any entertainment value. We know how it'll end -- she'll realize the brother isn't as wonderful as the idea of him is, she'll end up with her best friend, and the whole random romance in the middle there will have been a catalyst for absolutely NOTHING"
7bfS6seiLhk,So unrealistic dudes driving a gt350 yea right
7bfS6seiLhk,What she doing in his room at last... 😉😉
7bfS6seiLhk,I feel like this is going to be exactly like the no kiss list

7bfS6seiLhk,Looks like a bunch of dumb rich entitled white fucks
7bfS6seiLhk,So whom does she end up with?
7bfS6seiLhk,Wattpad!

7bfS6seiLhk,"I will not ruin my childhood (I wasn’t a child, but still) with this straight bullshit."
7bfS6seiLhk,Buy papa Murphy's stock instead of Netflix because Netflix has lost appeal to frsh because frsh is constant and small
7bfS6seiLhk,"I really want to see this, classic romantic comedy!!"
7bfS6seiLhk,please dont turn out a flop like Naomi and Ely's No Kiss List
7bfS6seiLhk,I’m not even a minute in and this looks so stupid I NEED to watch it
7bfS6seiLhk,Wait isn’t this a story on Wattpad or am I trippin
7bfS6seiLhk,Another clique movie oh great
7bfS6seiLhk,Looks like rich teen story. Big house private school.
7bfS6seiLhk,2:16 *The pillow of shame*
7bfS6seiLhk,Same hetro story line
7bfS6seiLhk,So much for 15+ years of friendship. What a disloyal snake.
7bfS6seiLhk,We are reaching new levels of cuccccccck holding
7bfS6seiLhk,I was half in half out until I saw Molly hell yea she in all my favorite movies and now TV shows the original brat pack ( only the old school people know about that ) lol
7bfS6seiLhk,Trash
7bfS6seiLhk,She looks 15 and looks 25. I’m uncomfortable
7bfS6seiLhk,"Rule #10: never ever break rule #9

7bfS6seiLhk,Awsm Elle...
7bfS6seiLhk,"I'm pretty sure I read this-- and correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't this bxb🤔"
7bfS6seiLhk,This. Looks. So. Boring
7bfS6seiLhk,My best friend’s brother is the one for me 🎤
7bfS6seiLhk,The dude flin im pretty sure saids and looks like Jeremy ughhh i miss him so much idk if its him or not
7bfS6seiLhk,TOTALLY READ IT ON WATTPAD IT’S AMAZING 😍😍
7bfS6seiLhk,Did anyone notice that Sound of Music inspired scene?
7bfS6seiLhk,Read the book like 8 times and loved it cant wait for the movie

Most guys and girls who we're best friends since birth usually end up together and have kids and get married and Have a wonderful life even if years later down the line they get divorce or it doesn't work out they still are Friends and Love each other Love each other even HSBC more kids lol. Marriage wasn't good for them financially or socially.
7bfS6seiLhk,What a bitch
7bfS6seiLhk,That’s Ramona from Ramona and beezus!  (Sorry if I spelt beezus wrong)😂

7bfS6seiLhk,Im addicted to cliche stories💖💖💖
7bfS6seiLhk,She's short as shit. Or he's just very tall but that height difference tho
7bfS6seiLhk,It’s such a cliche plot but I still want to watch it lol

I just hope it doesn't go that way. Would be to predictable 😥"
7bfS6seiLhk,OMG need to see this
7bfS6seiLhk,I don't think Ra's Al Ghul would approve this!
7bfS6seiLhk,So I guess Archies mom is having the time of her life when Archie is tryin to find a killer
7bfS6seiLhk,She’s all grown up😱. Im 26 and feel old🤦🏼‍♀️
7bfS6seiLhk,this is just one big porno
7bfS6seiLhk,This just fanfic into a movie
7bfS6seiLhk,The gayest thing to be put on Netflix in awhile. Netflix is going to shit especially since you took it’s always sunny off.

7bfS6seiLhk,Dont break rulee number 9
7bfS6seiLhk,"Dear Netflix, I am so going to watch this, this was our money well spent. From a heterosexual -wet- -white- girl's fiction into real life. So ten out of ten. Cause that's what I wanted to see because there are not enough stories about heterosexual couples that may have a queer person shoe-horned in a small town community. Even if there is another season of 13 reasons why, I definitely want more of this content. Raises the bar for realistic and deep art. Thank you -LCD"
7bfS6seiLhk,I’m so excited to binge this one the day before it releases!
7bfS6seiLhk,Where Victoria justice when you need her?
7bfS6seiLhk,Dude she just broke some rules. Dua is not ganna be happy. 😒

7bfS6seiLhk,Wow that dude is huge lol
7bfS6seiLhk,"IT started on wattpad and now it has its own freaking movie, dang. I don't like this types of plots at all but I have to recognize how the person who wrote the story got pretty far by just writing in a free website. Talent does come anywhere, anytime."

7bfS6seiLhk,"Cute, but everyone should go watch Devilman Crybaby on Netflix instead. THAT will make you feel stuff"
7bfS6seiLhk,"People in the comments are called the mom ""Archie's mom from Riverdale"" as if she hasn't been an ICONIC actress for decades.... I'm cringing"
7bfS6seiLhk,Ramona and Beezus is the first thing that popped in my head
7bfS6seiLhk,what a pretty face
7bfS6seiLhk,Have read the book so good hopefully the movie can stand up.

7bfS6seiLhk,They finally made The Kissing Booth into a movie! I hope they dont leave out details from the book

7bfS6seiLhk,"I'm inlove with the book and this movie but at the same time, I can't get over that the fact that they actually a couple in real life. Gosh. I love them. 😍😍"
7bfS6seiLhk,Rules are made to be broken.
7bfS6seiLhk,Thot
7bfS6seiLhk,Is this another high school movie set in the early 2000s?
7bfS6seiLhk,"Okay, so this looks really cliched and predictable and I'm definitely gonna be watching it and probably loving every second lmao"
7bfS6seiLhk,"Luke in love with El, but is overlooked by hunky dude, until El sees the light and El and Luke hookup, ... saved you 15 bucks."

7bfS6seiLhk,So the height difference is annoying
7bfS6seiLhk,duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuumb
7bfS6seiLhk,Typical untrustworthy woman. Go after the one guy who's off limits.
7bfS6seiLhk,Is she related to Rory Gilmore?
7bfS6seiLhk,This is like a shittier version of Edge of Seventeen.
7bfS6seiLhk,OMG
7bfS6seiLhk,They tell you the entire story in the description: she decides to run a kissing booth and unexpectedly ends up locking lips with her secret crush.
7bfS6seiLhk,"SO EXCITED!!!
I'm a sucker for cliches <3"
7bfS6seiLhk,https://www.amazon.com/Glyphics-J-Richard-Singleton-ebook/dp/B006M5L76S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525297780&sr=8-1&keywords=glyphics&dpID=51E4Kmrq0OL&preST=_SX342_QL70_&dpSrc=srch
7bfS6seiLhk,"Im elle, and this is my best friend that just so happens to be a hot guy

7bfS6seiLhk,1:44 “I am 16 going on 17 maybe da da
7bfS6seiLhk,BRO SHES FROM RAMONA AND BEEZUS
7bfS6seiLhk,Kissing booths it’s 2018 I thought they would have glory hole barrels by now
7bfS6seiLhk,OMG IS THAT RAMONA
7bfS6seiLhk,I want to watch this so bad
7bfS6seiLhk,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong cause I honestly DONT remember cause it's been forever, but wasn't the book a little more mature than this? I could have sworn there were definitely some scenes that got a lil hot and heavy. And also just the overall book wasn't this tweenie lol. Thoughts?"
7bfS6seiLhk,This reminds of that scene from The Sandlot 2 where Fingers (Sean Berdy) kisses the girl.
7bfS6seiLhk,Omg! This is based on the wattpad book... wooow I’m shook
7bfS6seiLhk,Wattpad? Movie?
7bfS6seiLhk,The height difference tho lmao
7bfS6seiLhk,here ya go 1:27
7bfS6seiLhk,Can’t wait
7bfS6seiLhk,That awkward kid from Super 8 grew the heck up.
7bfS6seiLhk,I’m excited to see this
7bfS6seiLhk,Looks like crap
7bfS6seiLhk,This looks so fucking garbage that I have to watch it
7bfS6seiLhk,"Wow, I thought I was the only person who had the name El..."
7bfS6seiLhk,ITS RAMONA
7bfS6seiLhk,Well I won't like it if she ends up with her bff's brother. Like  85% of childhood friends usually end up having crushes on them even if it's one sided. Besides the dude looks way older than her. If he is older he must have either 17 or 18 she is in the 11th grade plus he has a bad reputation
7bfS6seiLhk,"That’s not a boy, that’s a man ... dammm"
7bfS6seiLhk,This is basicaly no kiss list movie with victoria justice
7bfS6seiLhk,This is basicaly no kiss list movie with victoria justice
7bfS6seiLhk,Ramona!!
7bfS6seiLhk,wtf is Logan Paul doing here?
7bfS6seiLhk,"One day i'll find a movie where a guy and a girl that are best friends don't end up as a couple.. Nothing wrong with that, but seriously what the fuck is it with undermining the idea that a guy and a girl can't have a platonic relationship without secretly plotting to fuck each other?"
7bfS6seiLhk,"Wow stupid as fuck, last scene was kind of funny though but it’s all a rip off of the beginning of american pie 🥧"
7bfS6seiLhk,IS THIS OFF THE BOOK ON WATTPAD
7bfS6seiLhk,So Ramona had  finally find her boyfriend. good Ramona
7bfS6seiLhk,I've seen her somewhere before
7bfS6seiLhk,This is so unbelievably perverted.
7bfS6seiLhk,Ramona.
7bfS6seiLhk,Love how there also dating In real life. 😍🌼💖💖💖💖💖💙💙
7bfS6seiLhk,THIS WAS A WATTPAD STORY AND NOW IT'S A SHOW WTF

7bfS6seiLhk,OH MY GOD IM SO EXCITED
7bfS6seiLhk,Is she that conjuring girl?
7bfS6seiLhk,I feel like this is a knock off of The No kiss list
7bfS6seiLhk,"It looks cliche, but it looks fun and I'm a sucker for teen romances so 😅"
7bfS6seiLhk,Wasn't the book first published on Wattpad??
7bfS6seiLhk,This looks sooo cute!
7bfS6seiLhk,"Netflix is releasing too much movies.
how do we know the good from the bad?"

7bfS6seiLhk,It's Ramona!
7bfS6seiLhk,That moment when you have been following since the first chapter.
7bfS6seiLhk,The thing is...you made those rules yourself. You made #9 to not hurt your best friend and that's important!
7bfS6seiLhk,He is way too tall for her. Like she looks like a child compared to him.
7bfS6seiLhk,My fave wattpad book!!!
7bfS6seiLhk,The edge of seventeen vibes but from the friend’s perspective!

7bfS6seiLhk,Why does it look like 13 year old wrote this
7bfS6seiLhk,"Okay, so you create *another* hetero series, but can cancel a show with very good gay representation (Everything sucks) I think it’s very clear that Netflix’s higher up people are homophobic"
7bfS6seiLhk,ofc....its straight

7bfS6seiLhk,*The *killing booth would've been better*
7bfS6seiLhk,Soooo it's a movie about the ugly chick getting the hot guy simply because he's hot? Could the premise be any more shallow? Objectification is not okay!
7bfS6seiLhk,"Did anyone not notice the jar of vaseline, socks and some magazines under the guy's bed?"

7bfS6seiLhk,https://youtu.be/DcBVSdql1iQ
7bfS6seiLhk,"Wattpad has so many awesome stories some are really well written, have deep plots and great characters. I've read hundreds of ebooks from wattpad since 2012. These kind of cliche stories is one of the reason people think wattpad stories are corny and made by hopeless romantic teenages. Romance isnt the only genre available in wattpad. There are historical fiction,thriller, horror, fantasy, sci-fi,etc. I wish Netflix will adapt the stories from wattpad that are not as cliche as this."

One day I see on Snapchat that the other girl is flying somewhere, only for her to reveal that she’s flown all the way out of the country to see my best friend. I’ve felt replaced for a while ever since I found out she’s been telling this other things before she tells me. And then, she just magically flys over to see her, a trip they’ve been planning since forever. Should I be mad about it? Help me pls"

7bfS6seiLhk,How she receive a text without a notification
7bfS6seiLhk,"Oh gosh, this is amazing 💜😢"

7bfS6seiLhk,I'm so watching this. It's cute
7bfS6seiLhk,just showed the whole movie
7bfS6seiLhk,"I can’t believe I’ve seen this progress from a story on wattpad to a published book to now a movie, I’m so proud of the author!"
7bfS6seiLhk,I’m getting a WattPad vibe from this lol
7bfS6seiLhk,"OUAT Fam:
Doesn't she look like Bell's Daughter? And her name is Elle!!"
7bfS6seiLhk,Who remembers that mom from Riverdale?
7bfS6seiLhk,"I thought this was a prequel for 13 reasons why, wrong video."
7bfS6seiLhk,Omg wattpad anyone?!
7bfS6seiLhk,What is this? A 2000’s Telugu movie?
7bfS6seiLhk,Looks mediocre and very cliche. But I'll probably still watch it
7bfS6seiLhk,Seems cute
7bfS6seiLhk,2:15 “anything you guys need? Snacks? A condom?”
7bfS6seiLhk,Can´t wait to not see this.
7bfS6seiLhk,this is just like Naomi and Ely's No Kiss List
7bfS6seiLhk,the first part is soooo me
7bfS6seiLhk,Can't wait to watch this
7bfS6seiLhk,Dang it where is he? I can't find him.
7bfS6seiLhk,Wait?!? Is this the book from wattpad??
7bfS6seiLhk,"What a thot. If he was my brother, I would not speak with either of those assholes. Friends dont date your family members! Simple"
7bfS6seiLhk,Can’t wait 💖
7bfS6seiLhk,2:09 wow.  He reminds me of Dermot Mulroney at that angle.
7bfS6seiLhk,Please tell me I wasn't the only one to notice what was under his bed 😂😂
7bfS6seiLhk,I've watched this about 50 times and this is just making me more excited to watch it
7bfS6seiLhk,started out as a wattpad fic... wow. just wow.
7bfS6seiLhk,I could literally tell everything that happens in this movie with out even watching
7bfS6seiLhk,She messed up third friendship aww
7bfS6seiLhk,Didnt this girl came in Homefront with Jason Statham she got ass Now
7bfS6seiLhk,BEEZUS COME GET YOUR SIS
7bfS6seiLhk,"I hppe she loses her best friend in the end she shouldn't get a happy ending because in life there aren't always happy endings. I feel that if the rules weren't important telling her best friend shouldn't have been a big deal. Dating your Bfs brother isn't cool because he most likely had to deal with all the girls he liked only pretend to be interested in him because they were after his brother and to have your best friend interested in your bro after being the best friend and knowing everything about each other it's a HUGE deal breaker. I think a movie like this deserves a choice. It's either the friend you have been with your whole life or his brother with the reputation. Tjere should be no middle ground. She should have to choose friendship or love...
because if that's the case i can just rewatch 30 other movies with the same sad plot somewhere else."
7bfS6seiLhk,I expected/wanted it to be queer.
7bfS6seiLhk,this is a whole wattpad novel
7bfS6seiLhk,Thnks for telling the whole story already.
7bfS6seiLhk,What a gross movie. Why would anyone want to watch a movie about a pedophile?
7bfS6seiLhk,What a shitty friend
7bfS6seiLhk,So cliché 🤢
7bfS6seiLhk,I read this on Wattpad 🤣🤙

7bfS6seiLhk,"Even though this plot has been done a million times, I can't help but want to see it because I love Joey King. I think she has so much promise as a young actress. I'd watch anything with her in it."

7bfS6seiLhk,MAGENTA
7bfS6seiLhk,Classic Netflix
7bfS6seiLhk,Ramonaaaaaa
7bfS6seiLhk,Why is it in almost every film with people who are in school or university have a Lot of money like in that trailer You see that they have a Ford Mustang as their vehicle not their parents vehicle their vehicle their students what kind of parent give them the that kind of expensive vehicle. and they also live in a mansion up in the hills because if you’re gonna write a book like this you should be a little bit realistic A small percentage of people have that kind of lifestyle. Plus when you’re in University you don’t have that much money to spend you’re spending most your money on books for your classes and rent and where are they going to get the money to ensure that vehicle unless there parents are paying for the gas and the insurance on the vehicle in the insurance on the old Ford Mustang fully restored would be very expensive to insure. I’m just saying Writers or directors should be realistic when depicting a film like this
7bfS6seiLhk,Why does the lead guy look like he hadn’t left 2007
7bfS6seiLhk,Wattpad... All I can say is congrats to the author!
7bfS6seiLhk,"Netflix we get it, you're run by feminists that think mostly women watch tv...but you're wrong, that's why profit is down"

7bfS6seiLhk,I read this book years ago wow
7bfS6seiLhk,Lmao the only way to save this from being absolute trash is making her fall in love with her best friend instead but that would be cliché AF

7bfS6seiLhk,i ain't watching this shit!!
7bfS6seiLhk,I knew netflix handing out deals left and right but this looks like they actually bought a spec script written by a 12yo girl.

7bfS6seiLhk,Ramona <3
7bfS6seiLhk,Cool

7bfS6seiLhk,So much cringe I think I elected another Trump.
7bfS6seiLhk,"Is it me but isn't Hollywood trying to sell to teenagers that having sex when you are an underage teenager okay. Olus its fun to do it, magical almost. What they don't tell you is the reality and consequences of it."

7bfS6seiLhk,We want #sense8season3
7bfS6seiLhk,I love Joel

7bfS6seiLhk,it looks like edge of seventeen but not as good
7bfS6seiLhk,It’s Archie’s Mom ! 😱
7bfS6seiLhk,Best friend is probably in love with her and the brother hits it in weeks and the best friend who probably knows EVERYTHING about her still couldn’t get her. Women love the guy who pays less attention 🤷🏽‍♂️.
7bfS6seiLhk,Edge of seventeen remake or what?
7bfS6seiLhk,Was that guy holding a pillow to cover his boner? 2:16 🤣
7bfS6seiLhk,pretty? shes not beautiful at all.

7bfS6seiLhk,I CANT WAIT FOR THIS WTF. Him and His brother actually looks alike tho like an older version.
7bfS6seiLhk,Netflix pandering to its stupid liberal female audience
7bfS6seiLhk,Why do I feel like this could’ve been a Wattpad book?
7bfS6seiLhk,i saw her in THE CONJURING. and now she has SMALL BOOBIES. and she is so SMALL & CUTE.
7bfS6seiLhk,This looks so good
7bfS6seiLhk,Bitch this is so cliché

7bfS6seiLhk,basically just saw the whole movie in the trailer
7bfS6seiLhk,hahaha the end is funny
7bfS6seiLhk,Kissing booth literally just reminds me of the scene in She's the man between Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum. This seems too cliche
7bfS6seiLhk,ohh wow such a new concept!
7bfS6seiLhk,I so wanna watch this
7bfS6seiLhk,Oh my god is that Ramona from Ramona and beazzus
7bfS6seiLhk,Rule # 1 there's no Rule !

7bfS6seiLhk,Can’t wait for this
7bfS6seiLhk,This looks like it is going to be a terrible movie
7bfS6seiLhk,I feel like this film is going to be really dragged out and full of the cliché moments even though everyone is fully aware of what’s about to happen and that the trailer is just speeding up the process of watching it by confirming everything I expected from it. I know I sound like a massive hater and whatever loads of preteens will love this but can they at least change these kinds of films up a little?

7bfS6seiLhk,Late 20-year-old actors portraying teens in highschoolers

7bfS6seiLhk,should it be considered pedophile
7bfS6seiLhk,The girl is hot
7bfS6seiLhk,So basically she fucks over her best mate for a highschool romance. Noice lol
7bfS6seiLhk,"The moral of the story is that it's okay to betray your friends, as long as your hormones are telling you that you're in ""love"" with someone - based entirely on how they look. I like the whole ""he's a deep person...now that she has boobs"" angle, too. Really sends the message home that it's all hormonal. I sure hope she sleeps with him ""in the heat of the moment,"" so she can look forward to counting the days past her still unregulated period. Maybe then she can go ahead and knock out her first ""he left me when he found out I was pregnant"" abortion.

Great storytelling, Netflix. Really setting the bar."
7bfS6seiLhk,"joey king, ha crecido demasiado."
7bfS6seiLhk,I think that's the whole story

7bfS6seiLhk,Joey looks like a young Rachel Weisz
7bfS6seiLhk,Ramona grew up...
7bfS6seiLhk,"This is literally any Wattpad book ever 😂😂 
And that's exactly why I'm going to watch it ahahahaah"
7bfS6seiLhk,I’m sooo exited !!!!
7bfS6seiLhk,I'm so proud of Reekles. From being a story on wattpad to getting the book published to having a movie version. I'm so excited for this.
7bfS6seiLhk,Naomi and Ely's no kiss list was better

7bfS6seiLhk,I like that!
7bfS6seiLhk,There was no text on that phone lol
7bfS6seiLhk,I don’t get it wouldn’t she see her best friends brother as a brother too because she’s known her best friend literally since birth so technically they’ve all grown up together so it’s like siblings
7bfS6seiLhk,The Edge of Seventeen
7bfS6seiLhk,Casting for this is horrible 12 year old with like a 20 year old
7bfS6seiLhk,I feel like I have seen the whole movie
7bfS6seiLhk,can't wait for it!!!!!
7bfS6seiLhk,A waste of money

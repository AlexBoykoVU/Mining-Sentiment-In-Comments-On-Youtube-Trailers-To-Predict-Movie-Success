aDshY43Ol2U,Let me guess: Himself ( Liam Neeson ) is the man who doesn't belong.
aDshY43Ol2U,When watching any thriller set on a moving train - how long before they get on the roof?
aDshY43Ol2U,The best film ever
aDshY43Ol2U,Watched it today.. worth watching...
aDshY43Ol2U,liam neeson > van diesel
aDshY43Ol2U,Done watching today. this movie really rocks!!

aDshY43Ol2U,Last 3 Liam Neeson movies are basically Agatha Christie mysteries
aDshY43Ol2U,"Liam, you are doing it again....."
aDshY43Ol2U,"Cant wait to watch it, it looks really good üëç"
aDshY43Ol2U,"Member Berries: ""I have a certain set of skills... GIVE ME BACK MY DAUGHTER!""

aDshY43Ol2U,"Liam Neeson is always in the coolest movies with the coolest titles, but I thought he said he wasn't going to be acting anymore???"
aDshY43Ol2U,"""What kind of person are you""

""I am not a man of money, but I have particular set of skills, I will not find you and I will go to work"""
aDshY43Ol2U,The one that does not belong is the schoolgirl on the beginning of the film once the train begins!  Saw it last night. His friend is the killer! It was a setup! Muahhha
aDshY43Ol2U,Norma bates

aDshY43Ol2U,This movie is going to be a BOMB
aDshY43Ol2U,normaa
aDshY43Ol2U,"I hate when Neeson plays an average joe. It's much more interesting when Neeson plays a character is special forces or even some kind combat trained in put in a desperate situation. I know it's been done to death but its what he does best. The HELL, even the movie The Fray would have been truly boring if it weren't for Neeson. These thriller and dramas he does just royal suck. He plays a great badass and not a desperate average nobody in a desperate situation...."
aDshY43Ol2U,I heard patrick wilson is starring here as well. I kind of love vera with him ever since the conjuring
aDshY43Ol2U,I'm just happy to see Liam Neeson.

aDshY43Ol2U,Why Liam have to face these weird shit everytime he goes somewhere? Looking forward for the movie....!
aDshY43Ol2U,The hyproricy of this clown playing a hero while in real life he uses his fame and fortune to try and remove the #rightToLife from our unborn children of √âire. The big fella would turn in his grave if he knew this abortion activest once pretended to be him.

aDshY43Ol2U,Liam Neeson just can't catch a breaküòÇ
aDshY43Ol2U,Well it's obvious.  The only person that doesn't belong on that train is that bitch!  What kind of person would go up to a passenger on a commuter train to tell them to pick on other people for money??!!  And just for $75K??!!  Seriously??!!   The American middle class bribe money is that cheap now??!!
aDshY43Ol2U,The commuter's computer has been Taken by a  woman.  In return she left 75G

aDshY43Ol2U,"Liam Neeson, from the Taken Franchise and non stop + Vera Famiga and Patrick Wilson, most known for working together in the Conjuring series and their indivisual movies and shows like bates motel, insidious, orphan, and watchmen sound like a great mash up"

aDshY43Ol2U,"This film seems like DejaVu too me, if am not mistaken there was a film set in commuter with 2 persons mysteriously communicating like this...someone help me figure tis out"
aDshY43Ol2U,I swear almost every Liam Neeson action movie consists of him running around with a phone to his ear. A phone call with him has to be an intense experience.

aDshY43Ol2U,My white husband I love u Liam
aDshY43Ol2U,Good trailer. #TheCommuter
aDshY43Ol2U,Hak yiyen Hack yer!!!!!!!!!!!!!
aDshY43Ol2U,I feel this movie will be boring if majority of scenes are shot in the train or too much flashback if Liam found that it was dream or something in his mind. This will make movie kinda slow
aDshY43Ol2U,I got a feeling there will be part 2 and part 3 of this movie since Liam Neeson has Taken that train.
aDshY43Ol2U,I cannot wait out of the freaking love me some Liam Neeson yes!!!
aDshY43Ol2U,"First a plane, and now a train.  Next movie will be Liam nesson ""The Sailor""  all takes place in a boat."
aDshY43Ol2U,Liam is the goat
aDshY43Ol2U,"Like if you read ""The Computer"" at first."
aDshY43Ol2U,"I don't care if this movie is similar to two, three, or four other movie before. Lionsgate and Liam Neeson is good enough reason for me to not miss this."
aDshY43Ol2U,Yes!!! Taken 4!! ......ooooooh. :(
aDshY43Ol2U,"Liam Neeson is master of the trouble, dont near him if you dont want FIND TROUBLE, yesterday in PLANE and now in TRAIN, he should not taken that money :v"
aDshY43Ol2U,why is Liam Neeson always got into a trouble
aDshY43Ol2U,"Liam Neeson and Tom Cruise are two 50+ year old actors who could make bad movies watchable.

If you just gave me the description of this plot I would say 0.5% chance of me watching it. Just say Liam Neeson is starring and I am up to about 10% without a trailer. Add in a trailer with Liam Neeson and it is up to 20%"
aDshY43Ol2U,Non-Stop Taken?
aDshY43Ol2U,"Saw this before American Assassin and the second I saw Liam Neeson I was like ""okay, you have my attention."" Then it continued and I was like, ""wait, is this Non-Stop 2? I didn't think that was good enough to be a sequel."" Turned out it ended up being the EXACT same plot, just on a train and not a plane."
aDshY43Ol2U,"All his movies are the same shit!
Dont people get bored with this guy?"
aDshY43Ol2U,Looking forward to seeing this üëçüé¨
aDshY43Ol2U,oh count me in thriller with Liam Neeson hell yeah!
aDshY43Ol2U,"you send an envelope containing his wife's ring to him, bitch please you don't want to do this."
aDshY43Ol2U,Liam neeson awesome
aDshY43Ol2U,Why can't Liam Neeson take public transport without getting caught up in some terror plot or set up?
aDshY43Ol2U,Why isn't this film Source Code 2?
aDshY43Ol2U,super hit
aDshY43Ol2U,"Why do they go and do that make a movie by the people who made non stop..not make it the same people or world but literally give it the exact same story line but on a train and obviously some minor shifts in story....just call it ""non stop 2 the next stop"""
aDshY43Ol2U,Anyone else love the fact that Patrick Wilson is in this too üòÇüòç Patrick and vera together again
aDshY43Ol2U,This would be so much better with snakes. So he could say I'm sick of these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking train!
aDshY43Ol2U,He's gonna wake up realising it's all a simulation.
aDshY43Ol2U,Who would have thought that Ra's al Ghul was still stuck in that train after all these years.
aDshY43Ol2U,"I'd be like ""nah your alright, I've got memes to catch up on"""
aDshY43Ol2U,Liam neeson. The taco bell of actors. Somehow we don't recognize we keep buying the same 4 ingredients 30 different ways
aDshY43Ol2U,Free Watch The Commuter (2018) : Movie Trailer A businessman on his daily commute home gets unwittingly caught up in a criminal conspiracy that threatens not only his life but the lives of those around him. http://movieshotfile.com/movie/399035/the-commuter.html
aDshY43Ol2U,Why the hell can't people leave Liam Neeson alone when he travels
aDshY43Ol2U,He should just use the force
aDshY43Ol2U,this dude right here has the most interesting life
aDshY43Ol2U,And this teliar is super
aDshY43Ol2U,The vera joker version
aDshY43Ol2U,"He shouldn't have Taken her money. Now he has to look for her, now he has to find her... and he will kill her."
aDshY43Ol2U,Now that's a movie trailer. Tells us enough to be intrigued without giving away any plot twists.
aDshY43Ol2U,From the director that already made 3 movies with Liam Neeson.
aDshY43Ol2U,Can someone explain to me why we are doing the trailer before the trailer now?
aDshY43Ol2U,I thought this was hypothetical
aDshY43Ol2U,"I feel like this is what you get when you combine non-stop and the box, and then throw them onto Thomas the tank engine."
aDshY43Ol2U,Taken on a train...Non-stop on a train. Liam neeson playing himself on a train. exciting.
aDshY43Ol2U,You will only have a successful experiment if the human has complete societal freedom without the fear of consequence.
aDshY43Ol2U,BTW this could all be solved by wearing headphones
aDshY43Ol2U,Uhm... isn't this based on The Commuter Diaries?   https://www.amazon.com/Commuter-Diaries-R-Louise-York/dp/1517680069
aDshY43Ol2U,seems like Non stop + source code..
aDshY43Ol2U,"It appears as though Liam has become typecast, sad."
aDshY43Ol2U,LOL Same Music as in Red Sparrow Trailer :D
aDshY43Ol2U,Vera Farmiga is stunning
aDshY43Ol2U,He should never have Taken that train.
aDshY43Ol2U,i will find you and i will kill you
aDshY43Ol2U,"Well, I was going to listen to some music before calling it a night, but I think this is more pressing to look into first. 8D"
aDshY43Ol2U,I hear you. You're dead.
aDshY43Ol2U,"First ""the Accountant"", now ""The Commuter"". Movies are just taking the most boring, mundane occupations they can think of and trying to make exciting movies out of them."
aDshY43Ol2U,This is the first movie in history in which Liam Neeson isn't buttfucking every other character.
aDshY43Ol2U,"Vai ser  um sucesso nas bilheterias do cinemas de todo o mundo com f√© em Deus com esse elenco maravilhoso excelente filmes bons liam Neeson , vera formiga, Patrick wilson"
aDshY43Ol2U,Aw look it's Dean-Charles Chapman aka the late Tommen Baratheon
aDshY43Ol2U,i have a feeling Liam Neeson is the one that doesn't belong on the train.
aDshY43Ol2U,"Always super excited for a Liam Neason Action Movie, Huge Fan of his"
aDshY43Ol2U,Liam Neeson. Child threatened in some way or form. Some strange action going on.  Weird/dark plot with a huge background and follow up.
aDshY43Ol2U,The person who doesn't belong is him because he had an affair or something.
aDshY43Ol2U,Looks like blue whale tasküòÇ
aDshY43Ol2U,ok but vera doesn't belong in this movie she's too good
aDshY43Ol2U,At first I thought it was going to be a love affair between them...my dreams are crushed.
aDshY43Ol2U,"Why Silver Pictures didn't work ""The Commuter"" ?"
aDshY43Ol2U,en cuantos transportes p√∫blicos van a poner a a este se√±or a hacer una pel√≠cula?
aDshY43Ol2U,Liam Neeson's last action film : (
aDshY43Ol2U,Like anyone would allow themselves to be engaged in conversation while on public transportation lmao
aDshY43Ol2U,I've had a crush on Vera Farming since forever.
aDshY43Ol2U,Feels a little like Johnny Depp's Nick of Time.
aDshY43Ol2U,King Neeson
aDshY43Ol2U,You'd think he'd avoid trains after Batman...
aDshY43Ol2U,The person that doesn't belong is her.
aDshY43Ol2U,The Non-Stop Man on the Train
aDshY43Ol2U,LIAM NEESONS
aDshY43Ol2U,"I love this set up, I am excited and becoming a fan of the director"
aDshY43Ol2U,I love this kind of stories üëåüèª.
aDshY43Ol2U,why the fuck everyone always tryna set liam neeson up
aDshY43Ol2U,"His train got Taken

The Next-Stop

The Final Stop

Source Code Taken

It's part of the LNU ( Liam Neeson Universe ), regardless."
aDshY43Ol2U,MOTHER!
aDshY43Ol2U,Patrick Wilson?
aDshY43Ol2U,"First on a plane, now on a commuter"
aDshY43Ol2U,Where is his daughter?
aDshY43Ol2U,"""Once I get off this train....I will find you"""
aDshY43Ol2U,I thought this movie is the sequel of taken
aDshY43Ol2U,So non stop 2?
aDshY43Ol2U,"I can't be the only that read it as ""The Computer"" :/"
aDshY43Ol2U,This should be good. This is Liam's last action performance.
aDshY43Ol2U,Oh good another Liam Neeson Thriller
aDshY43Ol2U,FUCK YOU ITS JANUARY!!!!!!!!!
aDshY43Ol2U,Liam Neeson is gonna rock this. Too bad Taken 3 sucked.

42KNwQ6u42U,RUEEEEEEEE!!! <33333
42KNwQ6u42U,lol i got the trailer as an ad too
42KNwQ6u42U,sparler alert her mom was lieing she wasnt sick
42KNwQ6u42U,I'm seeing this on friday with my friends can i get 15 likes?
42KNwQ6u42U,"Although this movie seems like it going to be good, I feel like it's just basically a reversed version of ""The Space Between Us"". In that movie, the boy couldn't go outside (well Earth) to get to the girl. But in this one it's flipped, the girl can't go outside to get to the guy."
42KNwQ6u42U,I love this
42KNwQ6u42U,"Idk what it is.. maybe the acting, the script? But this whole trailer made me cringe. Was the book any good?"
42KNwQ6u42U,All of my friends wanna see this movie but me....I'm like the only one that doesn't wanna see itüòêüòêüòêüòê
42KNwQ6u42U,sometimes staying at home make me sick
42KNwQ6u42U,Who else tryed to call the number üòÇ
42KNwQ6u42U,"people mad because a white guy is dating black girl in yhe movie.  That is super common.  Because black guys nowadays like any girl thats not black, because of fear of the  angry black woman.  Black men cant simply tolerate  a independent black woman who cant be reason with.  This is why black guys are seen with latinas, cauasians, asisns etc.  For black women they just want a handsome man that is gentleman but doesn't like disputes or agruements even though that is part of life.  The movie seems cool, but risking death for a guy really.  So her boyfriend is death and she is a daredevil."
42KNwQ6u42U,looks shitty af
42KNwQ6u42U,This looks really good...the book sounds like a refreshing story...I'm proud of the author being as this was her first novel and it was turned into a major motion picture...kudos to her for sure!

42KNwQ6u42U,When I found out they were making it a movie I had a major freak out moment

42KNwQ6u42U,"My mom bought me this book for my 15th birthday simply because I thought the cover art was interesting. Now it has become one of my favorite books, and Nicola Yoo-hoo is now one of my favorite authors. I can't wait to see this over the weekend. I also highly recommend her second book, a sun is also a star if you haven't already it. And if you haven't read Everything, Everything yet either, what are you waiting for? READ IT NOW"

42KNwQ6u42U,IM SO EXITED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!
42KNwQ6u42U,"when will there be a big name movie that encourages a black couple that's in love?... with positive messages and with black men and women showing each other respect? I haven't seen one...do they feel black people not love each other? will it not get any funding if they want to make a positive romantic film with a black couple? do they not want black people to see something like that because it will encourage togetherness? Oh, but they'll promote something that encourages black division in a heartbeat. if they're going to produce this, why not make a big name film with positive, respectful black couples as well? Because positive, genuinely loving black couples do exist as well..."

42KNwQ6u42U,this is sad

42KNwQ6u42U,Nick Robinson is a stud
42KNwQ6u42U,I loved the book
42KNwQ6u42U,The book was life. Can't wait to see the movie
42KNwQ6u42U,I thought the dude was shawn mendes
42KNwQ6u42U,My sister's friend has a friend who is an extra in this movie. At least I think so.
42KNwQ6u42U,Is this a real sickness or did they make it up for the movie
42KNwQ6u42U,my heart hurts
42KNwQ6u42U,omg the book was so good!!
42KNwQ6u42U,i wanna see this
42KNwQ6u42U,Olly looks so much like Harry Styles.
42KNwQ6u42U,Book is better and in my imagination I pictured the people to be more handsome?? The actors are good looking but they're a bit different described in the book. I am still looking forward to see this movie even if a lot is given away by the trailer lmao
42KNwQ6u42U,finally a black girl with a white boy üòçüòçüòç ik I'm really gonna love this
42KNwQ6u42U,OMG
42KNwQ6u42U,Omg!!!!!! This movie is going to be everything well this and The Book of Henry! I can't wait for both of these movies. Mainly this one.
42KNwQ6u42U,something about this is just so annoying to me. still watching for nick though
42KNwQ6u42U,"I thought her mom was Korean, and her dad was African American?"
42KNwQ6u42U,I don't know why but I cried in this trailer but not the other trailers
42KNwQ6u42U,this trailer made me melt inside I'm crying its beautiful ‚ù§
42KNwQ6u42U,i feel like i watched the whole movie already
42KNwQ6u42U,I called that number that Olly wrote on the window
42KNwQ6u42U,Can someone tell me what song is in the background?
42KNwQ6u42U,"A pure drama about an interracial couple that is being smart and anti racist, but at the same time isn't a BLM type of film where all the white people are rude and racist. I like this."
42KNwQ6u42U,I've been waiting for this since I read the book. Omg
42KNwQ6u42U,wait why couldn't she go outside? xD
42KNwQ6u42U,is that Shawn Mendes with a wig on
42KNwQ6u42U,"Everything, Everything looks damn good and get you thinking of true love like damn get you feeling wow"
42KNwQ6u42U,this is gonna be the  movie of the year
42KNwQ6u42U,"OMG- you are all so fuckin lost its pathetic to read this crap. You all say it doesn't matter what color you are it's all about love (but when it's your type of love it's cool- the white man love). Why isn't that you see a dark skinned brotha busting slob with a milk white woman on TV and they had bi racial children (like the show of sexual contact)? The same reason you don't see a black man driving a Porsche, BMW, Jaguar or a Mercedes Benz in a commercial. You don't see what they're doing; what they're perpetuating on TV to kids, what that does to a little young black male- it shows him that I can't have this, this isn't meant for me, I can't go here, I'm not supposed to be in there etc."
42KNwQ6u42U,"Yes Olly, your sexy as hell."
42KNwQ6u42U,"Oh boy, it's the latest reiteration of The Boy in the Plastic Bubble but this time with an African American girl in the lead. At least Jake Gyllenhaal brought some fun to the role."
42KNwQ6u42U,I think the only thing I'm actually kinda mad about is that her swimsuit is supposed to be neon pink. Like could they really not afford a neon pink swimsuit with that budget that had??????
42KNwQ6u42U,Black girl starring in a movie amen
42KNwQ6u42U,Awww... SO SAD!!! WHY?!?!?!?!
42KNwQ6u42U,i started to cry. its so sweet
42KNwQ6u42U,Must. See. MOVIE!!
42KNwQ6u42U,so sad but beautiful
42KNwQ6u42U,I must see this!!
42KNwQ6u42U,At 2:01 she said my name! I'm like who me?
42KNwQ6u42U,"correct me if i'm wrong, but i distinctly remember the mom being Japanese"
42KNwQ6u42U,"Whelp, I guess it's time to pay a visit to Barnes & Noble!"
42KNwQ6u42U,Who watch this more than twice
42KNwQ6u42U,what's the first song please?
42KNwQ6u42U,NEEEEEEEEEEED to see that movie
42KNwQ6u42U,Hey that's the Jurassic World/ Melissa And Joey kid
42KNwQ6u42U,She snuck out in the night though?
42KNwQ6u42U,I wanna see this
42KNwQ6u42U,"The first time I saw this trailer I just fell in love, I just want to see this film so much!"
42KNwQ6u42U,Rue
42KNwQ6u42U,OHMFG I READ THEBOOKANDIMSOOOOOOOOOEXCITEDn!!!! I hope they do the cake thing at the window
42KNwQ6u42U,Omg i love this. I need to see this.  Love this couple and Nick is so hot. This is so inspiring and amazing.  Ly
42KNwQ6u42U,"This looks like it will be a decent movie, I kind of wanna see it"
42KNwQ6u42U,songs?
42KNwQ6u42U,I wonder when this comes out
42KNwQ6u42U,rue is so pretty
42KNwQ6u42U,Awh I'm definitely seeing this. ITS SO CUTE OMG
42KNwQ6u42U,If she's black and she's never been exposed to the sun wouldn't she have lighter skin than that?
42KNwQ6u42U,I'm actually excited for this movie
42KNwQ6u42U,"Its probably completely different, but this seems really similar to The Space Between Us....except no mars"
42KNwQ6u42U,My friend tolled me about this because she has the book and this movie looks like it's ganna be good
42KNwQ6u42U,I got an ad for the trails
42KNwQ6u42U,:046-0:48 looks like rue peeking at katniss in the hunger games
42KNwQ6u42U,Brooooo since I read the book hearing them talk is weird cause I remember every line like this book was soooo goood
42KNwQ6u42U,What is the song that is played throughout the trailer?
42KNwQ6u42U,I'm here cus I heard Beyonc√©
42KNwQ6u42U,Mark my words if I get famous I'm cuffing amandla stenburgüòçüòÇ
42KNwQ6u42U,Why can't she go outside?
42KNwQ6u42U,The girl is basically Michael Jackson
42KNwQ6u42U,She's not even black. She's mostly white.
42KNwQ6u42U,"Finally more interracial movies, buuut i'm not a sick black girl with a white boyfriend i'm just a delinquent with a white boyfriend who is also a delinquent üòÇ"
42KNwQ6u42U,"biracial ( black and white) children are black as well as white. My cousin is biracial and when someone asks if she is black she says yes because that's apart of her she doesn't say ""no im not black im mixed"". She is both and doesn't deny either part of her."
42KNwQ6u42U,This seems to remind me of The Fault in Our Stars and Room üò∂
42KNwQ6u42U,Shave his head
42KNwQ6u42U,Please someone knows the name of the first song played?
42KNwQ6u42U,"Can y'all stop noting about her skin and just appreciate the great story. 

Literally did not even cross my mind until I read the comments she was black."
42KNwQ6u42U,Why cant she go outside tho? She allergic to the dirty air? I don't get it
42KNwQ6u42U,"Movie looks dumb as fuck. In fact, it's super hard to find a good movie nowadays. There was a time when I'd watch a movie and it would get stuck in my head, I would revisit it and everyday life would remind me of it. Only ""get out"" has been that good. ""Kicks"" is another good movie. I personally liked the new ""Ben Hur"" and the Conjuring 2. ""War Dogs"" was decent.Jungle Book was good too. Moonlight was good. Matter of fact, never mind there has been some good movies but yeah, this shit looks stupid."
42KNwQ6u42U,This is everything <3
42KNwQ6u42U,what's the music
42KNwQ6u42U,RUE!!!!!
42KNwQ6u42U,If she never left the house then how she learn to swim
42KNwQ6u42U,cant wait to see it.
42KNwQ6u42U,"I just saw the movie today at an advance screening and I can this movie was super cute and encouraging in a strange sort of way. If u have never read the book, all the plot twists are pretty crazy. like good crazy. love the actors. it's worth watching it, especially if u live Nick or amandla"
42KNwQ6u42U,Song?
42KNwQ6u42U,what's the book version of this? cuz it reminds me of the boy in the bubble...
42KNwQ6u42U,"Cash me inside, how 'bout dat?"
42KNwQ6u42U,the book was amazing and reading it was an extraordinary adventure
42KNwQ6u42U,"""Maybe we can't predict the future, but we can predict some things""."
42KNwQ6u42U,What's the name of that first song
42KNwQ6u42U,Yo know
42KNwQ6u42U,Nick's hair grew and Amandla grew up
42KNwQ6u42U,I love the book. I read it a million times
42KNwQ6u42U,This is just like the space between us
42KNwQ6u42U,And Maddy 's story is the same as mine but  My name is Elizabeth
42KNwQ6u42U,"I have a sickness like that but I can be outiside but only for like 30 minutes if not my allergies act up and I need to be rushed to the hospital and I want to expreince everything too and I am home schooled 
    I am 18 and I might die if I be outside for too long
    So I mostly stay inside my house is like Maddy's but is white and I stay inside and Read coz I love reading I don't have many friends coz I am inside alot so Can I get 10 likes at least and maybe they can find a cure for my sickness"
42KNwQ6u42U,Her bathing suit is pink in the book

42KNwQ6u42U,OMG I FEEL LIKE CRYING WHAN A SEEE THIS AND WHEN IT END
42KNwQ6u42U,I bet you my fucking dog that she isn't actually sick. #predictablemovies101
42KNwQ6u42U,Still a better love story then twilight!
42KNwQ6u42U,the trailer with emoji didnt do justice
42KNwQ6u42U,"Why is no one calling up the issue on how this trailer makes disabled teens feel? ""Being disabled isn't really living!"" WHAT?!"
42KNwQ6u42U,It looks amazing
42KNwQ6u42U,It annoys me how different the movie is. It makes mash look so much more irresponsible than she actually is. Ugh
42KNwQ6u42U,Rue why you lyin? you were outside in the hunger games.
42KNwQ6u42U,"I'm currently reading this book and I'm loving it so far, can't wait for the film to come out!"
42KNwQ6u42U,Ok this trailer just spoiled the entire movie. Why would they do that
42KNwQ6u42U,boy in the plastic bubble 2017?
42KNwQ6u42U,"""I'm 18 and I've never been outside. If I did, I would probably die.""
Rapunzel anyone?"
42KNwQ6u42U,I want to see black on black love. Not some pale faced DEVIL! Disgusting x 3
42KNwQ6u42U,The trailer is so different from the book but I want to see it ughhhh
42KNwQ6u42U,I can't wait
42KNwQ6u42U,"ok?, ok."
42KNwQ6u42U,Everyone one in the comments are getting upset when someone comments finally biracial love. They don't mean it the first time because it's not but you don't a lot of young teenage biracial love on screen so but I can't wait for this movie üòÇ
42KNwQ6u42U,The concept looks like The Space Between Us.
42KNwQ6u42U,"THE BOOK IS AMAZING, CANT WAIT FOR THIS"
42KNwQ6u42U,Nice trailer probably a bad movie.
42KNwQ6u42U,she is from the hunger games
42KNwQ6u42U,"This entire movie is really should be about 32 seconds long.
She can't go outside
She steps outside
Realises she's fine outside
Then goes back inside to tell her mom
That's it"
42KNwQ6u42U,Just started reading this today can't put it down! I can't wait.  üòç
42KNwQ6u42U,"she never saw outside but she knows how to swim
logic fucked"
42KNwQ6u42U,If this movie was about a BLACK MAN WITH A WHITE WOMAN every comment would be about race. White men and black women are the biggest dating hypocrites.
42KNwQ6u42U,Omg I read this book and it was so sad/happy at the same time
42KNwQ6u42U,I love Nicola Yoon books I cannot believe that they are making a movie one of her best selling books Everything Everything.
42KNwQ6u42U,"Oh baby, it‚Äôs alright
It‚Äôs alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair
Old enough to run
Old enough to fire a gun"

42KNwQ6u42U,omg wanna see this so badly!!
42KNwQ6u42U,"This is the same movie as ""The Space Between Us"".... but I'll still watch it."
42KNwQ6u42U,It's Rue!!! This trailer almost made me cry.  Gorgeous.
42KNwQ6u42U,This trailer has been my every advertisement when I try to listen to music on YouTube.. YouTube basically forced me to search up this trailer. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME YOUTUBE?! I ALREADY SAID I WAS GONNA FVCKING WATCH THE MOVIE AS SOON AS IT'S OUT! YOU CANT COMPLICATE MY MUSIC TIME WITH THIS TRAILER!! YOU'RE MAKING ME FVCKING HATE IT! I'M GONNA WATCH IT! STOP ADVERTISING IT BEFORE EVERYYYY VIDEO I WATCH!
42KNwQ6u42U,i want to see this soooo bad
42KNwQ6u42U,"I can't tell if this is real or not, why does this trailer look fake. Even the title sounds spoofy."
42KNwQ6u42U,The fault in our stars 2017 versionüòï

42KNwQ6u42U,Omg I'm wanna see this movie so bad now lol they r so cute
42KNwQ6u42U,"as a black teenage girl who's really into white guys it actually makes me extremely happy to see this. When i approach white guys my age they usually say they never talked to me first because ""black girls intimidate them"" it just sucks that because my skin is brown *and not even darkskinned i might add* guys think im some hood, loud, aggressive girl. And when i try to talk to my black female friends they shame me for being into white guys or make fun of me. It's not my fault..we all have a type. Plus its not like i wouldnt date other races. My point is.. im really glad to see this. Maybe it will break some social awkwardness and white guys wont feel so afraid to approach me."
42KNwQ6u42U,Just finished the book and didn't see the ending coming!! Can't wait for the movie!!
42KNwQ6u42U,I already have a sinking feeling that they aren't gonna tell the story exactly like the book ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

42KNwQ6u42U,this is disgusting ableism! I wish they would have presented such disability properly. but this is just forcing even more ableism into society.

42KNwQ6u42U,IM HAPPY IM IN TEARS OMFG who read the book?
42KNwQ6u42U,"A white straight guy actually being portrayed in a positive image in a 2017 movie!? Wow unbelievable. Also it's nice to finally see a black girl and white guy together, instead of the usual black guy and white girl"
42KNwQ6u42U,"Sort of reminds me of the movie, Bubble Boy üòÇ"

42KNwQ6u42U,"Read the book, it's amazing"
42KNwQ6u42U,"I can relate to this movie in that I have been disabled & chronically ill since childhood, have never experienced freedom, joy, excitement, love or anything to look forward to all my adult life. 20 years in hospitals & homebound, but I know I will never find someone who loves me, or even cares enough to get me to a state I can SURVIVE IN, but I would settle for having a shitty van to live in, so I can spend my last months or year LIVING instead of EXISTING for drug companies & doctors to fuck with..."
42KNwQ6u42U,OMG THEY MADE A MOVIE IM SO HAPPY!!! I LOVE THIS BOOK!! AHHHH!!!!!
42KNwQ6u42U,"the girl is mixed, not black."

42KNwQ6u42U,Am I the only girl teen who isn't interested in this?
42KNwQ6u42U," I REALLY WANNA SEE THIS MOVIE, this is my definition of a perfect romance movie. Plus there's an interracial couple which makes it even BETTER. Does anyone‚Äã know if it's out, or when it's going to be out"
42KNwQ6u42U,if I don't see this movie I will die
42KNwQ6u42U,I knew I've seen that nurse before... it's the nun from Nacho Libre!
42KNwQ6u42U,now I want to see a gay love movie.

42KNwQ6u42U,Am I the only one who thinks that she's not really sick and that the only reason why she collapses is because she's never been exposed to the outside world
42KNwQ6u42U,Okay.. I've already watched this like 20 times.. I am obsessed
42KNwQ6u42U,Obviously she's mixed not just black ...so stop calling her just black.

42KNwQ6u42U,Yes I loved this book I had no idea they were making a movie
42KNwQ6u42U,at 1:55 it kinda looks like she's pregnant or it might just be that her shirt is puffy
42KNwQ6u42U,WHATS THE UPBEAT SONG IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE TRAILER?!
42KNwQ6u42U,I wanna see this movie so bad
42KNwQ6u42U,this ad came on before the trailer lol
42KNwQ6u42U,THIS IS SO CUTE

42KNwQ6u42U,I just finished the book and I swear if they don't include most of the things that made me fall in love with this book I might scream
42KNwQ6u42U,"As soon as my boyfriend gets out for summer we are definitely seeing 
this. He gets out May and we are long distance so I'm gonna make him go.
 It is also amazing because my name is Madeline but spelled Madelynn. 
Plus I also spell Maddy with a Y. Got to see if :D"
42KNwQ6u42U,omgomg I didn't realize the main girl character was Rue from THG until I read the comments!! she's so grown up now! :')
42KNwQ6u42U,"I just finished the book ! I've been dying to watch the trailer but I wanted to finish it first! So excited to see the cast :))
Edit: okay just watched it. Looks good.. But like.. Olly's voice sounds completely monotone no matter what he says, his facial expression never changes except for smirking... I've never seen this actor but I cringed at the short little scenes he was shown in. When Maddy meets him outside.. His acting is so bad xD HE SHOULD BE SHOCKED CONFUSED TERRIFIED but instead he's like

-______________- ""Maddy what's wrong"" *robotic voice with no emotion passion or anything human* UH SHES OUTSIDE XD SHE COULD DIE XD She didn't just fail her Spanish test or something xD ughhh im still gonna watch it. I kind of feel like the guy who played Augustus Waters or Josh Hutchinson would've been better. Daniel Radcliffe would've killed it for sure. Uuuuuuggghhhh man books to movies.. Get my hopes up every time that they can replicate everything. Even Maddys swimsuit is wrong xD it's supposed to be a bright almost neon pink. How hard is it to find one like that? Whyyyyy.
Or actually, like the guy attempting to play a passionate and full of life and emotion character like Olly would say

""-________________________-
            .why."""
42KNwQ6u42U,for a girl who stays inside her house for almost all of her life has pretty good clothes
42KNwQ6u42U,interracial couples yes
42KNwQ6u42U,What the song from 0:00 to 0:40
42KNwQ6u42U,Ok so tell me how the ad before this video was the everything everything trailer!!
42KNwQ6u42U,Do you guys want a book spoiler?
42KNwQ6u42U,For anyone wondering the two songs are human touch- Betty who and runnin' (lose it all) - Beyonc√© and naughty boy
42KNwQ6u42U,"While this seems like it would be a great movie, if she gets so easily sick.... why can she kiss someone???"

42KNwQ6u42U,"Betty Who - Human Touch is the song at the beginning.

42KNwQ6u42U,what song I is this
42KNwQ6u42U,I feel like they missed a lot from the book...

42KNwQ6u42U,I'm so excited for this movie! Nick Robinson is one of my favorite actors ever!

42KNwQ6u42U,I NEEEEEEEEED TO SEE THIS
42KNwQ6u42U,I swearrrr to gawddd Nick ROBINSON IS SOOOO HOT OMG!!!
42KNwQ6u42U,I really just stop with the swirl obsession cause I def know it's an agenda but if I didn't sorta like that white boy I liked him from Melissa &Joey if I didn't I would've thumbs down the girl is pretty too so I like just a little but black queens should stick to their black kings or if you don't dont bash them and black kings do the same don't bash ur queens without a black woman u wouldn't be here ! They like to see blacks hate each other to push their agenda what better way than to promote interracial üôÑinterracial is easier to succeed on getting a group of people to hate each other think about it do u ever see Asians promoting any interracial Asian and white or black in their countries NOPE üëéüèæ Asians actually respect whites and are quick to date them than any other race cause they fit more with each other cause their heathens and gentiles and the seed of the devil...but whites barely promote Asian and white ü§îin the media either but the one group whites hate they promote white and black love now üòíthat seems fishy asf if ur gunna date out ur race there is NO reason to bash ur own even if their bad there's bad people in every race but people are quick to talk about blacks because we hate each other once we show love to ourselves and our own people build up our economy they won't have nothing to say one day black will be on top I believe it and it will happen üëåüèætime to build the black community for good starting now don't get distracted by this swirl agenda it ain't gunna take y'all anywhere focus on school educating yourself researching ur own stuff cause the school system is built on lies I mean u got to get it to get a degree but it's very important to learn about real black history it didn't start with slavery‚ò∫Ô∏èand it ain't going to end in slavery either we are going to rule as god prophecies stated in the Bible :)

42KNwQ6u42U,"This story is suspiciously similar to Rapunzel: Untangled which came out 2 years before the book this movie is adapting. It's basically the same story, sick girl can't go outside, she meets boy, communicates through the Internet, he sneaks in, they fall in love, he takes her outside and other things happen which I won't say since I don't want to ruin anything for the people that haven't read or seen it yet. But to the people that have and know the ending, IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME!"
42KNwQ6u42U,"Everyone is like ""I stay inside.. this doesn't happen to me"" Her ""sickness"" didn't allow her to go outside, it's different üò§üò§"

42KNwQ6u42U,"If you want to know the whole summary of the movie, keep reading, because I've read the book. 

The story is about a girl who lost her father and brother to a car crash. A month after, she was diagnosed with such a sickness that caused her to never be able to go outside. Fast forward to many years later, and a new boy, Olly moves in next door and Madeline can't help but love him. They talk from window writing, e-mail, and texting and finally, one day he comes into her house. Madeline's well aware he could make her so sick, but after a few of these visits, they kiss. Madeline realizes there is more to life then just being alive and goes to Hawaii with Olly and she gets very sick there. When she returns home, she looks inside her folder of old medical papers and realizes she never had a sickness. Because of losing her husband and son, Madeline's mother made it all up to never let Madeline leave. Madeline runs away from her mother to where Olly moved to and lives there with him. Happily Ever After."

The book was really fast paced and the ending seemed so lazy to me. I thought overall it was just okay but I still do want to see the movie in hopes that they'll expand on the story and give more background on the characters and their futures. I don't know though, I think maybe the older I get, the more bitter I become or something, lol."

42KNwQ6u42U,I really wanted to see this movie but then it said it was the producer of me before you and if I stay and I've seen both of those movies and they both ended with death so I don't think I wanna see this movie because I think it will be very sick and I cannot afford to see another sad sad movie

42KNwQ6u42U,"The book is amazing, but does anyone else think that the song Issues by Julia Michaels fits this movie/book perfectly?"

42KNwQ6u42U,NICK ROBINSON YAASSS!üòç
42KNwQ6u42U,"They could've at least stuck to the book with a few things, Maddys bathing suit is pink in the book, Olly has blue ocean eyes. I can understand Ollys brown eyes its hard to find a perfect match but at least give him some colored contacts or something, if you read the book it doesn't show the part where he tapes pics of oceans to her window, anyways if you've read the book and the movie adds stuff it messes up the whole book, you have to go re read it to make sure you didn't miss something when really they just threw in something. But either way I love the book and I'm dying to see the movie. Looks great."
42KNwQ6u42U,"SPOIL ALERT!!!!!!!!







Maddy was never sick, her mom got a breakdown when her husband and son died, so she lied and destroyed Maddy's life just to keep her safe. She was never sick and didn't get to experience life until she found out (pretty much in the end of the book)

Oh, the scene when she nearly died was because she never was outside for a long 17 years... (according to the book)"
42KNwQ6u42U,This is what happens when parents raise there kids inside and give them medicine for everything. The immune system can't handle simple bacteria.

42KNwQ6u42U,I just saw this trailer in the theater this weekthis sounds so much like the premise from Bubble BoyI hope it's good
42KNwQ6u42U,I feel like the trailer spoiled the main twists of the book such as her going outside. If the ended on her going outside it would probably have been more powerful :P

42KNwQ6u42U,"Daniele:Cash me out side how bout dat
Madeline:oh I can't go outside or else I'll explote"
42KNwQ6u42U,"Looks cute if not super cliche and straight up tired at this point. How many ""inspirationally terminally ill person gets love interest that helps them see the meaning of life"" movies are we gonna have to sit through? The only thing that makes this unique is the fact that the main girl is black for once lol. Glad Amandla's finally getting some work after Hunger Games, it just sucks that between this and that awful looking Nazi romance movie she's in (its a Holocaust flick about her hooking up with the son of a Nazi and ""curing his racism/antisemitism""...like....How) idk if her career is gonna take off :/. She's cute and a fine actress I'm sure, but there are more than enough cute lil lightskinned actresses right now. Idk if she'll be able to stand out unless she gets in a certified Good Movie. All luck to her tho."
42KNwQ6u42U,okay this album is going to be lit.
42KNwQ6u42U,When is this movie coming out?

42KNwQ6u42U,Rue has grown up.
42KNwQ6u42U,how can you be allergic to everything?!
42KNwQ6u42U,"So, the girl is very lucky. She has a mother who is able to create these perfect conditions for her daughter, and she's hot as hell, which is why a guy pays attention to her. I mean, her tragedy is wanting something she can't have. So, it's actually a universal story and something most of us can relate to, only with a different setting."
42KNwQ6u42U,"I just finished the book recently when the trailer came out. Is it just me or did most things change based on what i'm seeing, compared to the book?"
42KNwQ6u42U,"Seeing these characters come to life, it's amazing"

42KNwQ6u42U,Love the trailer! But I wish they didn't show her leaving the house... in the books that's like the whole good plot and I feel like everything is kinda spoiled for the actual plot
42KNwQ6u42U,"Love transcends all racial bs, but the way I see it; Depressed Black girl/Black boy whose found happiness once some random White person comes rescue them from their ""hell hole"". We've all seen this storyline before.

The fact Black Actors or Actresses cant have success in these type of movies (among NonBlack crowds) UNLESS their Costar is of a different race, shows you how sick America/the audience still is.

Seeing more B/W IR couples shows you progress, but when the image is pushed by the media, it shows you fear; of Black unity. But considering how much money is being made off Black division, I can understand why."
42KNwQ6u42U,"The book was so good! Excited to see what they do with the movie. 

Also where's the All the Bright Places movie?!?! üò≠"

42KNwQ6u42U,such a great movie can't wait
42KNwQ6u42U,"the one thing that I will never be able to understand, is why people have so much hate in their hearts. doesn't it bother u guys at times?? if u don't wanna watch the movie simply because a black girl was used, then u can drive a chain saw right into your heart and die.....racist bastards looking like decomposed sperm!!"

42KNwQ6u42U,"Ok think this film is a complete copy of the space between us:
Boy lives on Mars and can't leave his room because of his bones and gravity on earth
But desperately wants to leave
-
Girl can't leave house because of illness and desperately
 wants to leave 
-
Love pushes him to escape even though his guardian has warned him not to leave
-
Love pushes her to leave her home though her mum does not want her to leave
-
The boy runs away with his love to find his father and to explore the world and the oceans 
-
The girl runs away with her love to explore the world and the oceans
-
They boy goes to a sunny beach with the girl and has a near death experience 
-
The girl goes to a sunny beach with her love and probably has a near death experience 
-
Overall both films are about teens that are exciled from the rest of the world but wants to explore the world with the love of their lives even though they could die...
-
Complete copy of a great film ~Space Between Us"

42KNwQ6u42U,I have been on immune suppressants for nearly six years. This book and movie is complete and utter rubbish. Where are her pimples and her constant phlegm hanging out of her nose because of her suppressed immune system? I can't handle my sickness let alone would a guy. No guy or man wants to go into a relationship knowing their girlfriend is sick. I speak for all people on immune suppressants saying this is a load of rubbish and would never occur in real life. It's books and movies like this one and the Fault in Our Stars that make us the sick ones seem ridiculous and something that never happens ever in real life. ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!

42KNwQ6u42U,The Space Between Us and this are too similar. Teen love + possible death... are books nowadays too predictable or is Hollywood just thirsting for money? Most likely both
42KNwQ6u42U,RUE! LONG TIME NO SEE BUDDY!
42KNwQ6u42U,"I was really disappointed in the book tbh, don't get the hype"
42KNwQ6u42U,IM SO EXCITED I LOOOOVED THE BOOK
42KNwQ6u42U,Kiss low specifically iamsh morning option online both supply.
42KNwQ6u42U,Oh my god... Is that Rue from the Hunger Games???
42KNwQ6u42U,Whats the song at the start??
42KNwQ6u42U,"Made me want to read the book, since I can't watch a movie based ona book until I've read the book, only exceptions would be The Jungle Book, Flipped, and Little Women (which is why I have that rule, have you seen how big that book is?)"
42KNwQ6u42U,Bubble boy girl version üôÑ
42KNwQ6u42U,"üòÇüòÇ perfect trailer but the movie seems boring now, unless she has secret powers and invisible enemies"
42KNwQ6u42U,from the flattest chest in the hunger games to.........üòÄ
42KNwQ6u42U,"Description: bubble girl might die if she goes outside, boy moves in next door. starved for any type of male attention drama ensuses, girl probably dies for stupid contrived reasons to force a heart wrenching ending but will end up being critically bashed."
42KNwQ6u42U,Didn't I see this movie in the '70's? The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.
42KNwQ6u42U,"If she has been indoor since time immemorial, how she could jump into the sea like that? I myself struggled for week to learn swimming ."
42KNwQ6u42U,What is the the name of the first song that plays? it's been stuck in my head and it's driving me mad.
42KNwQ6u42U,"Another typical ""romantic"" flick. Girl is sick. Boy loves girl. Girl's fam is like, ""No"" . Girl rebels. Runs away with boy. 

Yolo swag we're having so much fun.

Girl ded. 
Boy cries.

The end."
42KNwQ6u42U,is this rue from the hunger games? also this looks like a low-budget hbo snoozefest lol
42KNwQ6u42U,Is that the weeb from Jurassic world
42KNwQ6u42U,Shawn Mendes what are you doing here
42KNwQ6u42U,"I mean, I'll jump."
42KNwQ6u42U,hell yeah
42KNwQ6u42U,"Wait, I thought she died in the Hunger Games."
42KNwQ6u42U,"Just saw the whole movie in the trailer ;) thx btw... and let me guess, she dies at the end?"
42KNwQ6u42U,really spontaneous Combustion...
42KNwQ6u42U,Her hair is like RIDICULOUSLY well moisturized...Lawd
42KNwQ6u42U,"Sequel...Everything, Everything Homicide!"
42KNwQ6u42U,Am i really going to have to see Rue die twice? smh
42KNwQ6u42U,This reminds me so much of bubble boy oml
42KNwQ6u42U,Bubble boy with black people
42KNwQ6u42U,She did well considering she's never been outside to swim back to the surface after jumping off a cliff. Quick learner.
42KNwQ6u42U,Just here for the Beyonce and Naughty boy song lol
42KNwQ6u42U,Not bad
42KNwQ6u42U,someone always has to be dying in these dumb teen romance movie...
42KNwQ6u42U,I just wanted to laugh at the title really quick- bye
42KNwQ6u42U,The thing that makes this trailer so good is the song.
42KNwQ6u42U,I really knew from the thumbnail that this little clip will have a lot of likes and very few dislikes . I mean finally we get some biracial love kind of story
42KNwQ6u42U,Why are people acting like Bi-racial relationships are uncommon? Just saying since some people only comment on this movie is that they're glad to see a Bi-racial couple.
42KNwQ6u42U,I read the book which was AMAZING and I can't wait to see this!
42KNwQ6u42U,I've seen this trailer like 14 times. Probably going to make it 15 now
42KNwQ6u42U,Spoiler alert: she dead.
42KNwQ6u42U,Omg I have the book and have read it 3 times. Can't wait for this movie!!!
42KNwQ6u42U,"Does anyone genuinely go to the movies to enjoy these movies? No hate if you do, but they all seem to have the same story"
42KNwQ6u42U,I feel like this is fault and our stars all over again
42KNwQ6u42U,"I am already a fan of Amandla, great casting choice of the lead male, he doesn't seem pretentious."
42KNwQ6u42U,"So basically in the book, I thought the mother had the illness and the daughter didn't but because she is used to living indoors  she has a weak immune system"
42KNwQ6u42U,"I'm SO EXCITED the book was amazing and the movie looks really good, like it might live up to it."
42KNwQ6u42U,How to abuse your child 101
42KNwQ6u42U,i am so looking forward to this looks beautiful
42KNwQ6u42U,"Looks very

42KNwQ6u42U,Music at 1:02
42KNwQ6u42U,"Maybe if she didnt live in the smog infested area like Los angeles, she wouldn't be sick"
42KNwQ6u42U,that seems so incredible I wish everyone could just easily find their soulmate that young
42KNwQ6u42U,what was the song playing in the beginning??
42KNwQ6u42U,"I wish they added a little more small details from the book like her having long hair,wearing a white shirt and blue jeans, and she didn't have a phone."
42KNwQ6u42U,I keep watching the trailer I reallllyyyy want to watch the movie !!
42KNwQ6u42U,"I love this book, but they just gave the entire thing away in the trailer. Kinda ruins the surprise of it for those who don't know the plot :/"
42KNwQ6u42U,I can't believe this is the little girl from hunger games. She's grown so much.
42KNwQ6u42U,Hunger Games meets Jurassic World. Who recognized them?
42KNwQ6u42U,Boooooo......a sister with a weak immune system meets and falls for a walking disease? Booooooooo.............
42KNwQ6u42U,what's the song at the beginning?
42KNwQ6u42U,Worst trailer ever
42KNwQ6u42U,"why everyone saying ""finally bi racial love"" when we been had the best bi racial love story already come out?


28 days later. best love story."
42KNwQ6u42U,Is the disease real?
42KNwQ6u42U,this just reminds me of Bubble Boy
42KNwQ6u42U,"I love the diversity of skin color in it. Not the tipical ""black girl & black boy"" or ""white girl & white boy"""

42KNwQ6u42U,Does anyone know when this is coming out?
42KNwQ6u42U,"I haven't read the book but I'm guessing from this trailer that her mother has been lying about an illness the entire time and the only reason she falls ill at 1:54 is because she has never been outside before, thus is more susceptible to sickness from bacteria in the air."
42KNwQ6u42U,RUE?! IS THAT YOU?
42KNwQ6u42U,Im already crying
42KNwQ6u42U,"WAIT! IF SHE HAS NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE, HOW DOES SHE KNOW HOW TO SWIM? EVEN IF SHE TOOK CLASSES SOMEHOW, THERE ISNT A POOL AT HER HOUSE.........."

42KNwQ6u42U,"OMG, i read this book just this past month together with The sun is also a star by Nicola Yoon. I literally got goose bumps watching this. This is the exact interpretation  of the book (every scene), but it feels like the trailer gave all the story away.
I'm still looking forward to it though. :)"
42KNwQ6u42U,I feel like I just spoiled myself from watching this trailer ugh
42KNwQ6u42U,I read the book and really hoped a movie would come out to. so exited

42KNwQ6u42U,...STOP SHOWING THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN THE TRAILER
42KNwQ6u42U,The trailer gave away most of the book. A big part of the novel is the slow reveal of secrets and events. This trailer showed its entire hand. Bad marketing.
42KNwQ6u42U,Plot twist: she isn't really sick and she is told she is so she can stay home.
42KNwQ6u42U,Plot twist the girl is actually a kidnapped child brain washed by her fake mom
42KNwQ6u42U,When the ad for the trailer you're about to watch is literally the trailer you're about to watch
42KNwQ6u42U,I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS BEING TURNED INTO A MOVIE

42KNwQ6u42U,"Ah yes, because Me Before You and If I Stay are such stellar examples of the romance genre. /s"
42KNwQ6u42U,"Wow, I thought people were overreacting when they said trailers give away everything... now I can see their point"
42KNwQ6u42U,she seems to have no difficulty with human interaction for someone who has been stuck in a house for her whole life...with only 2 people to talk to...
42KNwQ6u42U,I love the book !

42KNwQ6u42U,"It's like Bubble Boy (2001) I swear if it turns out at the end of this movie that she was not even ill and her mother was making it all up, then they just stole the plot for this movie."

42KNwQ6u42U,"Yay! Not another race movie!!!! And this looks so cute too, I'm not into romances but I might watch this one. üíïüíïüòå"
42KNwQ6u42U,Rue is gonna die... again
42KNwQ6u42U,"2:08 Wait she's never been to the sea, but she knows how to swim? Because i'm pretty she would drown, and is that supposed to be a swimsuit? Because if it is, then it makes zero sense. Boring and repititive plot, sloppy attention to plot details, mediocare acting and yet another cheesy romance film. And why is everything twice in the name of the movie, that's just dumb"
42KNwQ6u42U,Id rather watch bubble boy
42KNwQ6u42U,So fault in our stars with less cancer
42KNwQ6u42U,I HAVE DIED AND AM NOW DEAD THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVERRRRRRRR LITERALY DEAAAADDDDD

42KNwQ6u42U,Does anyone else think that Nick Robinson looks a little like Brooklyn Beckham?? üò¨üò¨

42KNwQ6u42U,I'm already excited
42KNwQ6u42U,LOL people are bitter why does this have so many dislikes
42KNwQ6u42U,"She's playing a half-Japanese character...yet no one calls it out, even though she's supposed to be a social justice activist, yikes. Interesting."
42KNwQ6u42U,The Secret Garden hipster edition
42KNwQ6u42U,this is bubble boy only a bit diffrent and there is no wedding to stop and the character could actually die.
42KNwQ6u42U,Rue??
42KNwQ6u42U,SO EXCITED üò≠üòç
42KNwQ6u42U,i can¬¥t believe they keep doing this. Whenever a book is great they just have to do a cheesy movie that has nothing to do with the actual book and that is absolutely rubbish. I hate to see one of my favorite books turned into ... whatever this is

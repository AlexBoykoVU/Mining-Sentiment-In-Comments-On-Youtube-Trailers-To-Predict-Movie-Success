It‚Äôs the WORST movie OF ALL TIME
Seriously, don‚Äôt waste ur money on a shitty movie like this."
a6O30nJ02PU,Ahh yes a magic island with a genie twisting the wishes. So remember kids be very specific when making a wish
a6O30nJ02PU,The worst movie i have seen ever.
a6O30nJ02PU,I remember the original TV series. Farthest thing from horror. So sad.
a6O30nJ02PU,Three things wrong with this trailer. The blonde main girl seems like a horrible actress. The stock sound effect of the little girl laughing is so bad. And the stereotypical nose bleed in a horror clich√©.
a6O30nJ02PU,Lucy Hale is really good. She was in truth or dare as well
a6O30nJ02PU,Holy shit I thought Hannah Wells was dead
a6O30nJ02PU,This looks great and epic I can't wait to see it
a6O30nJ02PU,‚ÄúThe plane! It‚Äôs here.‚Äù That‚Äôs it? That‚Äôs all we get?
a6O30nJ02PU,"Blumhouse and Michael Pena is enough for me to lose interest. After seeing this my suspicion was confirmed. Crap ! Fantasy island was not horror, MR Roarke was not a villian, where is Tattoo ? I'll pass !"
a6O30nJ02PU,Omg I like really wanna watch this-
a6O30nJ02PU,Because their fantasies happen duuuh you want it you got it wish granted that‚Äôs why they used 7 rings ..
a6O30nJ02PU,that looks fucking GOOD. Also you got me sold with 7 Rings. the way the song played is perfect.
a6O30nJ02PU,THIS MOVIE IS PROBABLY GONNA BOMB AT THE BOX OFFICE.
a6O30nJ02PU,Definitely will watch. Once it hits the $3.50 movie bin at Wal-Mart. No way in hell would I pay more to hear a song by AG or watch LH try to act. Made that mistake once.
a6O30nJ02PU,This is how *dark web* works
a6O30nJ02PU,Ya
a6O30nJ02PU,Ya
a6O30nJ02PU,Already calling it it‚Äôs gonna two hours and there‚Äôs only gonna be jump scares to stop the audience getting board
a6O30nJ02PU,Why am I getting so many ads for this movie
a6O30nJ02PU,Why do I keep getting ads for this  while I'm listening to the Beatles and queen
a6O30nJ02PU,When seven rings started playing I was very very confused
a6O30nJ02PU,Ariana Grande shouldn‚Äôt be the soundtrack of any horror movie trailer like wtf
a6O30nJ02PU,"The shortest short film I‚Äôve seen, but why did they put a date at the end?"
a6O30nJ02PU,Duration??
a6O30nJ02PU,leave it to blumhouse to make a remix of 7 rings for a horror movie.
a6O30nJ02PU,Who else was confused through the whole trailer?
a6O30nJ02PU,Dude I've been waiting for this new Scooby Doo!
a6O30nJ02PU,"Such a good movie!!!
Just watched!!"
a6O30nJ02PU,Trailers always giving away too much.
a6O30nJ02PU,Cabin in the woods: Island edition
a6O30nJ02PU,My friend is in this. got to see it opening. its worth the cash hey. would say its worth a night out for .
a6O30nJ02PU,Another Hollywood hack job. WTF is this abomination.
a6O30nJ02PU,Lost meets Westworld meets The Nun
a6O30nJ02PU,Watchers: I want to watch something that is not Fantasy Island.                                               Ads: wElCoMe tO fAnTAsY iSlAnD

a6O30nJ02PU,Looks shit
a6O30nJ02PU,This movie is great. Forget about all the bad reviews. The story is good tho. I don't like the ending but i do like the easter egg in the end. ( Hint : A partner for the boss)
a6O30nJ02PU,Cool
a6O30nJ02PU,"This is made by the same sickos who made The Purge and The Hunt.  Oh, sorry, just satire!"
a6O30nJ02PU,Remember when the television show got spooky. Rourke had to do battle once. So this movie is no stretch of the imagination.
a6O30nJ02PU,this is nothing like fantasy Island. and where the hell is tattoo? am I a joke to you?
a6O30nJ02PU,"I want to live on an island like this, please someone help me"
a6O30nJ02PU,So the Midget is now a Black Chick???? What a weird casting choice. I wonder what part of this particular story would prompt Hollywood do to such a thing.
a6O30nJ02PU,7 rings yey!
a6O30nJ02PU,Movie looks really good
a6O30nJ02PU,Ah yes Lucy hale back at it again with another movie with the same concept as the last
a6O30nJ02PU,Just watch it last night
a6O30nJ02PU,Ooooh yes... OOOOH YES...
a6O30nJ02PU,Could not pay me enough to sit through this
a6O30nJ02PU,they ruined it with ariana grande
a6O30nJ02PU,IM FINE WITH THE HORROR UPGRADE BUT IM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CHOICE FOR MR ROURKE AND THE FACT THERES NO TATOO. WTF MAN HOLLYWOOD IS SHIT!!!
a6O30nJ02PU,"I usually don't like remakes but I like the way this one is gonna be, if they would've stayed true to the original tv show, it probably would have been boring"
a6O30nJ02PU,How the hell are you gonna remake fantasy island into a horror movie? Smdh.
a6O30nJ02PU,Wanna see this
a6O30nJ02PU,Kayak hangout film Indonesian
a6O30nJ02PU,Maggie Q is really beautiful
a6O30nJ02PU,I have watched this movie. Really makes you think hard to understand the plot and this movie so cool
a6O30nJ02PU,YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT !!!
a6O30nJ02PU,Aria revenge on - The  A's  players
a6O30nJ02PU,far cry 3 was a great game.
a6O30nJ02PU,"idea for the movie is amazing and original but actors and the way they acting is terrible 
Joker's father asked little Joker why so serious ? 
but my question for the actors in these modern times is why so superficial ? why so intense, why so arrogant and full of yourself, why you must look badass in every second of the movie, why trying so much and overacting ?!?!?!?
i miss those old times and old school of acting, actors were acting on the normal and relaxed way which looked very realistic, they were showing deeper emotions on their face
today actors overacting too much, trying too much to show how badass they are and in that process they look too much cold and heartless and that is the main flaw in all movies, because we want to see that fragile human side in human actors instead of watching that robot-machine side in human actors

we live in times when showing compassion and emotions is very dangerous for the one who is doing that, in the modern world where we struggle each day to prove to ourselves and to other people who is tougher, more cool, more invincible and badass, in world like that fragile and deep emotions are not welcome
so we all trying to reach that stadium of being heartless invincible being, cool looking while being tough and nothing can damage your flow and your cool
but, thats the time when we step into the problem and our destruction, thinking that being the man of steel and heartless is cool, that is our doom
to be cool is being well mannered, educated, carrying, nice to other people you belong to
unfortunately the only cool human today is the one being badass and heartless, driving fast cars, having big house, expensive cloths and so...
somewhere in the process we stopped thinking that being more human is cool
thats why movies sucks these days, because actors being the part of the modern times lost that humanity as well

whole mankind instead of breaking that shell step by step around our mind and body, we are only diving more deep into it, just like a scared turtle
you cant see legs nor head peeking outside, the only thing you can see, is just that shell
hmmmm   storyless shell i would say

ahhhhhh too much i talk and too little folks can understand what i am talking about...
at least i tried...
we dont need corona virus or any other virus, the future we are making right now will be strong enough to destroy us all by targeting our weakest spots, and those spots will be the humanity in us !
which is fading day by day..."
a6O30nJ02PU,What if your ultimate fantasy was an orgy?
a6O30nJ02PU,"I always thought '7 rings' was kinda eerie. 

FANTASY ISLAND proved that."
a6O30nJ02PU,Micheal Pena is always good value.

a6O30nJ02PU,I've heard that Aphrodite might be in this - not sure if it's just a name or if they mean the real Aphrodite. Or if it was just something someone made up or misheard about the movie.

a6O30nJ02PU,I'm too broke and pathetic to go watch this :(
a6O30nJ02PU,Why did they leave out Tattoo? He and Mr Roarke. could have swung into action and saved the guests before it's too late.
a6O30nJ02PU,I don't trust Blumhouse anymore... I'll wait until this is free to watch somewhere.
a6O30nJ02PU,Each actor to get a role with song records or Sony pictures must go to the circle sacrifice they do before releasing the movie . Its real guys

a6O30nJ02PU,"Sorry...but this film really sucks!Is that Hollywood will never learn?I don't understand!Why change everything in the series that was memorable in a stupid horror movie?Look at the box office failures like ""The Duke of Hazzard"", ""Baywatch"", ""Land of the lost"", ""Chips"" ... etc ... BOX OFFICE  FAILURES!
Not even Tattoo is there!I hope this movie is a total failure and that fans are not going to see such garbage!

a6O30nJ02PU,"The sad thing, is that Fantasy Island already had some kinda weird themes, where it was a little terrifying in an abstract, david lynch way, and I've always wanted something to iterate on that more in a way they wouldn't have back when the show was made...... but of course, this feels like the brilliant people at Blum House missed any of the darker elements of the original show, thought they were really original making fantasy island dark, and then did their standard horror shtick on top of the fantasy island show. Sigh.... all that potential, down the drain."
a6O30nJ02PU,Blumhouse??? Sony???? U don‚Äôt see that everyday

They could have called it ""Be Careful What You Wish For"", and the island host could have been Mr. Smith. There is, and will ALWAYS be only ONE Mr. Roarke...and it could never, EVER be Fantasy Island without Tattoo. And he did not have boobs. Sad that movie makers today are 100% incapable of a single original thought."

Edit: but it doesn‚Äôt really look like the show...."
a6O30nJ02PU,Whats theme song???

a6O30nJ02PU,Wow...this way off from the source material. The original TV show was not like this at all.
a6O30nJ02PU,Wow üòç

a6O30nJ02PU,This is like the movie HAUNTS OF THE RICH from 1972 TV movie ... lord another remake no one comes close to my Ricardo Monteban I had a super crush on him ü•∞üòç
a6O30nJ02PU,just another secret society themed movie...
a6O30nJ02PU,Hope Tattoo the short man and Mr. Roarke are on the movie cos if they're not on its not the remake of the show ...
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks like Blumhouse still hasn‚Äôt figured out how to  get around exposition?
a6O30nJ02PU,Wow dat actually look good
a6O30nJ02PU,I know the whole movie from all the trailer s
a6O30nJ02PU,"FANTASY ISLAND: wanna come to our island :)?

Me: how ungrateful I‚Äôd love that"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Damn, they've messed up one of my favorite shows!"
a6O30nJ02PU,"This is more like a ""Lost"" reboot, not like the 1978-1984 TV series that ABC aired then."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Unfortunately Tattoo won't be in it saying ""DEE PLANE DEE PLANE!!!"""
a6O30nJ02PU,looks dumb

a6O30nJ02PU,"so wait. in the beginning they said in the elevator had a button to go to that place idk how to word it, but technically anyone could've pressed that button, unless it was in her room. so idk"

a6O30nJ02PU,"That music - during the elevator part - drove me crazy until i remembered where it came from - Brian DePalma's Body Double from 1984 - track is called ""telescope"" by Pino Donaggio. Anyways, seems like a cool twist. I've learned to trust Blumhouse."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Definately not what you think of fantasy island. Where is tatoo? ""The Plane The Plane Guy""

That show wasnt even a horror 

Fantasy Island my foot"
a6O30nJ02PU,a twisted version of a beloved show ...... this all that the current assholes in hollywood can come up with  ..... they cant come up with anything original so they have to shit on previous shows from the past .... i hope this piece of crap tanks

a6O30nJ02PU,I love how the childhood bully in this film is played by the same girl who bullied Carrie in Carrie by pulling the prank with the pigs blood. Just seems cool because of how iconic the prom scene in Carrie is and it was all because of a bully

a6O30nJ02PU,This looks pretty bad
a6O30nJ02PU,Here before 35‚ÑÖ on RT
a6O30nJ02PU,so... you basically ruined the trailer by putting the stupid... trailer preview bs in front of it completely killing any sense that this is NOT a horror movie by showing that its totally a horror movie... idiots...
a6O30nJ02PU,I assumed when I saw a poster for this it would be a nice family movie then I saw it was produced by blumhouse
a6O30nJ02PU,"Why did they not bring back Tattoo, the midget who was Mr. Roarke's assistant? Was it because Herv√© Villechaize , the guy who played Tattoo on the show (who is dead by the way) was very difficult to work with?"

a6O30nJ02PU,Chris Hargensen survived flying through a windshield? Wow.
a6O30nJ02PU,My guess for the girl and her bully: they start to have feelings for each other but the bully is killed before they could let each other know.
a6O30nJ02PU,Bruh who else came from them TikTok ads
a6O30nJ02PU,"If Ricardo Montalbahn were still alive he‚Äôd hate this. Stupid. That‚Äôs all. They screwed up a great TV series and turned it into a horror movie just like Banana Splits becoming a horror movie. üòÇ 
Famous actors and actresses would make special appearances and have their fantasies brought to life. Ok same idea here. But too much horror. The music was catchy, Tattoo was funny, and (sigh) Hollywood...really?!
But then again what if I‚Äôm wrong? I see this hitting Redbox in three months after it‚Äôs release.
What‚Äôs next? Happy Days? (Singing slowly for more emphasis: Sunday....Monday...Happy Days (chainsaw sound)...Tuesday......Wednesday....Happy Days (screams ‚ÄúOh! No! NOT JOANIE!‚Äù)."

a6O30nJ02PU,What if my fantasy is to escape a horror movie
a6O30nJ02PU,"If this movie doesnt have a short man yell out ""De plane boss, de plane!"" I will be severely disappointed"
a6O30nJ02PU,I thought it was Debby Ryan at firstüòÇüò≠
a6O30nJ02PU,They probably want then to transform and let go to pass on. üôÉ

a6O30nJ02PU,Another  childhood  show crapped on by Hollywood.
a6O30nJ02PU,Can we stop talking about 7 rings for like 5 seconds and find out where the music intro soundtrack is from?? üëç
a6O30nJ02PU,"Yeah, only sluttier."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Blumhouse. 
I love how you give EVERYTHING away in the trailers lol. I passed on Truth Or Dare, Ma and I‚Äôm gonna pass on this crap too. See ya next year for Halloween Kills tho.."
a6O30nJ02PU,Can y‚Äôall just stop and accept the fact that it may be the idea from something else but it‚Äôs still kinda an original idea instead of another remake... yet y‚Äôall are fine with 1000 Star Wars movies
a6O30nJ02PU,This comes out on Valentine‚Äôs Day but I just watch the whole movie right here
a6O30nJ02PU,Lol i thought this is a family movie but its a horror movie but im still gonna watch but im gonna prank my firend that this is a family movie
a6O30nJ02PU,....uh...I don't remember the tv show being quite so creepy?? Wtf!
a6O30nJ02PU,Wtf are u sure 7rings ?ü§£
a6O30nJ02PU,Cant believe that 7 rings was so match with horror üòÇüòÇüòÇ
a6O30nJ02PU,Nobody is gonna mention how this is literally episode in a movie
a6O30nJ02PU,This is nothing like the series fantasy island
a6O30nJ02PU,Am I the only one this remind me of The Banana Split Movie?
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks like it‚Äôs a fantasy now to have good actors
a6O30nJ02PU,Is it just me or I acctually dig the creepy version of Arianas 7 rings?
a6O30nJ02PU,Full movie PLEASE
a6O30nJ02PU,"NOT NOW, JIAN YANG!"
a6O30nJ02PU,the sequel: go into the elevator and press the number 1 and see the next level..
a6O30nJ02PU,7 rings fits really well like the song I got 5 on it in the ‚ÄûUS‚Äú trailer
a6O30nJ02PU,7 rings' lyrics fit the trailer so well. I'm impressed.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Where‚Äôs the fat midget? You know, da plane! Da plane boss!"
a6O30nJ02PU,Lucy Hale yesssss
a6O30nJ02PU,Nikita Ooo girl
a6O30nJ02PU,"Why is this an adaptation of Fantasy Island? If you wanted to make a movie about an island where fantasies turn to nightmares, that is perfectly fine. No shame in being unoriginal. After all, Lucy and Limitless are two takes on the same concepts and are wildly different. But what the hell are you banking on with the IP? Nostalgia? Why?"
a6O30nJ02PU,Once i see this actress... I know this movie is going to suck
a6O30nJ02PU,Nice
a6O30nJ02PU,Vaas narrating :D?
a6O30nJ02PU,The girl bullies her in school but now since she is tied to a chair she suddenly says girls were friends üë´!!!üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÇ uhh noo sis ‚úãüèΩ
a6O30nJ02PU,7Rings
a6O30nJ02PU,jeffery epstein's island
a6O30nJ02PU,This is just not right.  To mess up something so iconic in the seventies.  To take something magical from childhood and turn it to this.
a6O30nJ02PU,Cant they come up with something original?
a6O30nJ02PU,NTNC -- No Tattoo No Care
a6O30nJ02PU,Torture my bully is so relatable to me ngl
a6O30nJ02PU,Stop me if you‚Äôve heard this one ‚Äúbitchy blonde goes to a secretive location to party with her friends and they all die‚Äù
a6O30nJ02PU,*_What?? No Ricardo Montelb√°n & Herv√© Villechaize_* ü§î
a6O30nJ02PU,This looks terribly lame üòí
a6O30nJ02PU,Laaaaaaame. Basic pop song in the background. Check. Insanely attractive young adults. Check. Jump scares. Check. Hollywood star name. Check. Party vibe trailer scene to entice the younger demographic. Check. This movie's going to suck.
a6O30nJ02PU,It's nice to see Angela again after Mr. Robot S4 ep1.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Jian-Yang!!!! 
- Erlich Bachman"
a6O30nJ02PU,No thanks. I hate it. This is such a stupid way of ruining a great shows legacy and all the potential its premise has.
a6O30nJ02PU,Where's evil Tatoo ??
a6O30nJ02PU,Cheap Bitcoins are going to kill me???
a6O30nJ02PU,Its get less scarier because of the 7 rings.
a6O30nJ02PU,low trailer
a6O30nJ02PU,Ohhh they use Ariana song
a6O30nJ02PU,So I‚Äôm the only one who thought of A when Lucy hales character said revenge on a high school bully ok üëçüèΩ
a6O30nJ02PU,Press the button to the floor with no name... You mean.. üßê... The button beside the snake-engraved wall? Tell me: how many instances has a snake on ANYTHING EVER been a positive thing ü§î
a6O30nJ02PU,Was this written by the same person who did the Banana Splits Movie?
a6O30nJ02PU,"**O-M-Gee** -- the trailer opens with Pino Donaggio's erotic-tinged track 'Telescope' -- from one of my favorite noir thrillers, De Palma's 'Body Double' (1984) ... noice-sters !"
a6O30nJ02PU,Epstein's island more like.
a6O30nJ02PU,Hostel on holiday
a6O30nJ02PU,"Who remembers the Fantasy Island series reboot from like late 90s early 00s? I liked it, but it got cancelled pretty quick."
a6O30nJ02PU,This movie looks and sounds like it's gonna have a dumbass plot
a6O30nJ02PU,"Plot twist:


It‚Äôs Jeffrey Epsteins island"
a6O30nJ02PU,What she know about TŒºp√•c? Lol
a6O30nJ02PU,Where's tattoo
a6O30nJ02PU,"They're obviously trying to cash off of Lucy Hale, but I mean, she's not bad, but her TV shows and movies haven't been tbe best, her most viewed thing was PLL."
a6O30nJ02PU,i was thinking fantasy island the strip club in LA lmfaooooo
a6O30nJ02PU,Why y‚Äôall turn Ariana song creepy
a6O30nJ02PU,"They probably never watch the series cause, they are way off."
a6O30nJ02PU,Omg I can‚Äôt wait to see this amazing serie
a6O30nJ02PU,"Wait, isn't fantasy island supposed to be a happy tv show?"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Okay.....if i was tattoo, and i lived on fantasy island.....my fantasy would be... 



.....To not be a midget."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Just like a fantasy, you don't get what you wish for in the trailer either..."
a6O30nJ02PU,So they made the tv show into a horror movie
a6O30nJ02PU,They won‚Äôt put the midget since that wouldn‚Äôt be pc.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Wow, this is so different than the original! But where is Tattoo?? Da Plane Da Plane!"
a6O30nJ02PU,Arias really in deep this time
a6O30nJ02PU,"Entire cast of attractive people under 35 acting stupid. Gee, that's original Sony. Maybe you should make more films like that...oh wait."
a6O30nJ02PU,I just want to meet the person who turned 7 Rings into horror music and shake their hand
a6O30nJ02PU,OK that song by Ariana is killing it in this trailer üòçüòçüòç
a6O30nJ02PU,"I dislike Fantasy Island into horror movie at all. Nothing like the tv show I watched in 1980 when I first time watched it. I think this trailer is terrible. The movie will flopped too. Remaking movie into movie was terrible. Jem and the Holograms flopped so quick, Gi Joe movie also flopped including few other original tv show into movie shouldn't be made at all. My honest opinion . I'm really sorry you wasted your time make remake tv show into movies. The original tv show should stay that way. No more remake movies into movies is terrible idea. Sorry."
a6O30nJ02PU,I clicked for Lucy Hale üò¨
a6O30nJ02PU,Michael Pena is no Ricardo Montalban.
a6O30nJ02PU,WHERE'S TATTOO?
a6O30nJ02PU,I love Lucy Hale
a6O30nJ02PU,And..... Hollywood shits all over another classic TV show by turning in to Hostel 3....geez... I'm shocked..ü§®
a6O30nJ02PU,Ooh Lucy Hale becoming a scream queen
a6O30nJ02PU,I spent majority of this trailer trying to remember what her name in pretty little liars was
a6O30nJ02PU,Scooby doo return to zombie island
a6O30nJ02PU,Wow I want to watch this
a6O30nJ02PU,I would assume in true Fantasy Island fashion that the Point is for the guests to learn a lesson
a6O30nJ02PU,Yes.
a6O30nJ02PU,"I cringe to think what ""Gilligan's Island"" will be like"
a6O30nJ02PU,Are they making movies to flop these days because ... seems like they are. heh
a6O30nJ02PU,"""In the the elevator you press the button with no name"" - well none of them have names they're all numbers and a couple of letters. Why not just say the button with the snake symbol on it? Another Hollywood script with dumb dialogue"
a6O30nJ02PU,"I wish this wasn't just a horror movie. The beauty of Fantasy Island was the variety of stories it could tell given the setting. True, some of the stories were dark, but you also had lighthearted stories as well, sometimes in the same episode as a more serious story to break the tension. 
And the overall tone of the original show was lighthearted, what with the interactions between Mr. Roarke and Tatu. This remake clearly did not care for its source material and just wanted to use the name and setting to make a cheap run-of-the-mill horror movie. 
And if you think it's not possible to tell stories of various genres in a single movie, look at The Twilight Zone movie from 1983, a movie based on a classic anthology TV show that told stories from a variety of genres. I'm not saying that Fantasy Island 2020 should follow the same format, just that they treat the series with just as much dignity."
a6O30nJ02PU,"1:20 is so awkward, like why."
a6O30nJ02PU,"They couldn't even get a midget to yell ""The Plane, the Plane!""?"
a6O30nJ02PU,With the same guy that ruined CHiPs.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Total Garbage.  Name it something else.  This is NOT the Classic TV show. Tattoo always was the one to say. ""The Plane, The Plane."" He was not a woman. Stop stealing Classic TV shows Maybe make, I don't know. A new movie maybe."
a6O30nJ02PU,"So, is the black girl supposed to be Ariel from the 90's Malcom McDowell series, or Julie from the later 70's series (the replacement from when they were thinking of dropping Herve Villechaize)?
Oh, heck, it's Blumhouse, why are we even DISCUSSING resemblances to the original?"
a6O30nJ02PU,YES!  I have always wanted to see Fantasy island how it was MEANT to be presented. Not the watered down TV version.
a6O30nJ02PU,Hmmmm...interesting they're utilizing Pino Donaggio's track from an underrated movie called Body Double
a6O30nJ02PU,Lol there's an amusement part in my area called Fantasy Island
a6O30nJ02PU,I was thinking ~ooh! Ariana must be so happy her soundtrack is in a movie!!!~ few minutes later: hear then make it scary. Me: .-.
a6O30nJ02PU,Yes 7 rings !!!!
a6O30nJ02PU,Why is Lucy hale always in movies like this
a6O30nJ02PU,"From the writer's of ""Truth or Dare"" yeah I fukcin pass. This movie will be another flop."
a6O30nJ02PU,Lucy Hale doing the damn thing ‚ù§Ô∏è so proud of her
a6O30nJ02PU,Yessssssss
a6O30nJ02PU,Crap.
a6O30nJ02PU,I NEED THE 7 RINGS REMIX FROM THIS
a6O30nJ02PU,Actually looks interesting
a6O30nJ02PU,Coolü§©
a6O30nJ02PU,"üòÆ I WAS LITERALLY BINGE-WATCHING THE ""FANTASY ISLAND"" SHOW LAST YEAR (WITH MY PARENTS SOMETIMES, TOO), AND NOW IT'S GETTING A MOVIE?! THAT'S KIND OF AMAZING.



Oh, wait, it's a Blumhouse movie . . . ."
a6O30nJ02PU,The fantasy island is run by Androids from exstinction. U CANT CHANGE MY MIND
a6O30nJ02PU,this thrills.. waiting for the movie
a6O30nJ02PU,BRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

a6O30nJ02PU,7 Rings.... I want it.. I get it..
a6O30nJ02PU,Wow people have some sick fantasies jesus.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Fantasy Island was always a book-end to The Love Boat when I was growing up.  I was aware of them but rarely watched; however, I feel that the Love Boat deserves the horror treatment as well.  Get going all you Hollywood folks who don't have an original thought anymore.....In fact, there are lots of 70's shows that could be considered.  The Waltons (inbred mountain family of cannibals....done!)...The Odd Couple - wait, that was a movie first already....and they've already done Single White Female, which is kind of an Odd Couple....Taxi could take you lots of horrifying places....Three's Company was already kind of horrifying, never mind.  Don't touch WKRP in Cincinnati....."
a6O30nJ02PU,ill watch
a6O30nJ02PU,"so roarke and tattoo were combined into one character.
this is hostel island!"
a6O30nJ02PU,"On Indonesia you can watch film like this and called ""Pulau Hantu"" same concept"
a6O30nJ02PU,lucy is so juicy like here who agrees

a6O30nJ02PU,Hard pass.
a6O30nJ02PU,"There went my favorite televison show as a child, ruined."
a6O30nJ02PU,one word... project utopia
a6O30nJ02PU,"Well, they ruined that show."
a6O30nJ02PU,KKKKKKKHHHHHHAAAAAANNNNNN!
a6O30nJ02PU,I know the previous versions are infamous but if they really wanted to do a horror movie on an island they need to properly remake ‚ÄúThe Island of Dr. Moreau‚Äù.
a6O30nJ02PU,Who's idea was this?
a6O30nJ02PU,Im sorry but who is asking for these reboots?! This came out in 1977!
a6O30nJ02PU,Why was it necessary to give away the movie's twist in the trailer?? I might have actually gone to see this had they not spoiled the whole thing in under 3 minutes.
a6O30nJ02PU,"I honestly believed that was Jack, from Lost."
a6O30nJ02PU,Holding out for the horror version of SANFORD AND SON or THE GOLDEN GIRLS!
a6O30nJ02PU,Where is the midget? Why did they replace him?
a6O30nJ02PU,Blumhouse is stepping up their game.
a6O30nJ02PU,First Banana Splits and now this?
a6O30nJ02PU,So tattoo grew up and took over.
a6O30nJ02PU,Childhood ruined. Thanks Hollyrewrite.
a6O30nJ02PU,"I would love to see ""Fantasy Island""  but not as horror.  I would love to see Fantasy Island pushing the bounds of sex, nudity, and intimacy.  When I think fantasy, I think power and sex and ""what if""."
a6O30nJ02PU,Why'd you put 7 rings as the soundtrack for a horror movie? üòë
a6O30nJ02PU,"Is this concept based on ""Table No. 21"" bollywood film....."
a6O30nJ02PU,So what now you've started using a pop song as a score? Come on Hollywood! üòí
a6O30nJ02PU,"Smiles everyone, smiles!"

a6O30nJ02PU,Why? The original was great. Leave it alone. FFS
a6O30nJ02PU,What if my fantasy was just to have orgy every night with bunch of hoes ?
a6O30nJ02PU,"What's even the point in remaking this, if you don't keep what was recognisable from the show?"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Really Sony ?! Another Remake?! 
How are you not bankrupt yet??!!"
a6O30nJ02PU,7 rings ruined the horror

a6O30nJ02PU,"Oh How Lovely!   Turning a great show from the 80s into a horror movie.....Not!      Hollywood is most certainly running out of ideas. It is a wonder that streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime are the ones showing unique and different original movies and TV Shows, while Hollywood studios are simply being unimaginative and lazy with rehashing old movies and TV shows."

a6O30nJ02PU,My fantasy would have been harem like normal fuckin people.
a6O30nJ02PU,Literally nobody is mentioning the fact that this is based off of a TV show that is about as far away from horror as it gets

a6O30nJ02PU,Stop the montage
a6O30nJ02PU,I‚Äôd say this is weird but considering the nature of the original fantasy island I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs too much of a stretch
a6O30nJ02PU,Seriously dystopian!
a6O30nJ02PU,"First the Banana Splits, now Fantasy Island, makes you wonder which show is next to recieve the horror treatment."
a6O30nJ02PU,This is an AU of the shining
a6O30nJ02PU,All I can see is Lucy Hale‚Äôs bad plastic surgery.

a6O30nJ02PU,Screw you.... You took one of my favorite shows and twist it.... Screw you.
a6O30nJ02PU,I remember one woman's fantasy was to be able to spy on her boyfriend so she got to turn invisible.  However she had to be naked because her clothes were still visible.
a6O30nJ02PU,The ending ‚Äúi got it‚Äù
a6O30nJ02PU,"not sure about this, as the show, which i watched all of when i was a kid. Was about teaching people a lesson. It had a supernatural feel to it, and the character roarke obviously was a person who had or controlled a ability that he could make things happen. I think the movie is playing off as a horror one, and at the end the twist will be that a lesson will be learned, maybe a few who don't learn might not come back. But we will see, be a shame if it is just a damn horror movie will be disappointed if that is the case."

a6O30nJ02PU,"What's more scary than the song, is that all of the people complaining about the song... actually know what the song is. I'd never heard that garbage & had zero idea who it was until I read the comments. Most of you just gave yourselves away as Ariana fans. LOLOL!!!"

a6O30nJ02PU,They could hand us the entire screenplay and it wouldn't make a difference with how much they just showed in this trailer. Don't think I'll enjoy the movie anymore. At least get out and us kept the twists to themselves until the movie was released.
a6O30nJ02PU,üëçüëçüëç
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks alright but i can already tell its going to have a million + 1 jump scares and I hope i'm not alone in saying that jump scares are soooo over used.

a6O30nJ02PU,"Of course they would turn it into a horror movie. =_= Darker and Edigier sells, am I right. Hehe... Oy.

a6O30nJ02PU,"Pressed the ""Serpent"" button.

a6O30nJ02PU,"The only scary thing in this trailer is when I saw that annoying dude from Any Man movies, I can't watch him!  lol"

a6O30nJ02PU,So this is the tech piece Xin Yang has been working on... Silicon Valley crossover
a6O30nJ02PU,A bit of a lame title if you don't mind me saying so.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Richardo's coffin (lined with RICH Corinthian leather) is spinning so fast, we could harness it to power half of the US."
a6O30nJ02PU,2:01 Well they clearly copied IT with the jump in transition and branding there.
a6O30nJ02PU,Love the horror twist on the OG Show.

a6O30nJ02PU,No one's talking about Luis?
a6O30nJ02PU,I guess A sent aria to an island to die
a6O30nJ02PU,So this is basically the adult version of The Chronicles of Narnia.
a6O30nJ02PU,"What a weird release dat for a movie like this Valentine's Day, a lot of breakups gonna happen üòÇ"
a6O30nJ02PU,"revenge on a bully sounds AWESOME !
Since in the real world those deepshits go always unpunished"
a6O30nJ02PU,Was not expecting they'd turn the old TV show into a horror movie.
a6O30nJ02PU,Made fantasy island in to a haul movie miss going to lose more money than the new Terminator movie
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks lame.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Turn a relatively light hearted 70s drama into a horror flick. Yeah , that makes sense....NOT!"
a6O30nJ02PU,No de plane boss de plane gets a meh
a6O30nJ02PU,"Everyone likes to hate on Blumhouse but like really they've come out with some interesting and fun movies. I'm excited for this, and I'm definitely excited for The Invisible Man."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Or ""Westworld"""
a6O30nJ02PU,when they show BlumHouse.. then my mind said this must be reboot/remake.. do research a little bit and yes.. it was based on.. 1977 Fantasy Island
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks watchable...but why wrap it with such a douchey first act atmosphere? Lucy Hale needs to stop playing these lame Stereotypical gen Z characters.
a6O30nJ02PU,Nikita is Backüëåüëåüëåüî•üî•üî•üî•üòÑüòÑ

a6O30nJ02PU,How about the FNAF movie?
a6O30nJ02PU,Why they make cinemas which will surely be flop
a6O30nJ02PU,Now I just need the Love Boat as a horror movie
a6O30nJ02PU,"At first I thought this was a romance,Comedy, teenagers movie but then....I was shocked"
a6O30nJ02PU,Fun Fact: The music at the beginning is the same music from that Tom Cruise movie  Risky Business.

a6O30nJ02PU,Expected a giant shark or a tsunami. Turned out to be another psycho movie.
a6O30nJ02PU,Release in Telugu
a6O30nJ02PU,Cool movie.
a6O30nJ02PU,There is never any cell phone service in these kinds of movies. Duh.
a6O30nJ02PU,Dumb movie another Hollywood trash
a6O30nJ02PU,Lost the series the movie
a6O30nJ02PU,I don't think this is supposed to be scary.
a6O30nJ02PU,Nikita still looks so hot!
a6O30nJ02PU,Hollywood is creatively bankrupt. Stop destroying the 80's you talentless hacks!!!
a6O30nJ02PU,"whenever you see ""blumhouse pictures"" you already know what you're getting yourself into."
a6O30nJ02PU,"So no little person sayin ""de plane"" wow Hollywood so much for inclusion right"
a6O30nJ02PU,"So ""7 rings"" got the exact same treatment that ""I got 5 on it"" got for Us. I see a trend here"
a6O30nJ02PU,so this is the movie for which ariana grande made a video song .
a6O30nJ02PU,Can anyone tell me what is that song in background?????
a6O30nJ02PU,"I've never watched the show, but this doesn't really seem like it needed to be an official adaptation."
a6O30nJ02PU,"0:19 This looks nice 

0:22 (See‚Äôs blumhouse productions) Oh sh*t here we go again"
a6O30nJ02PU,cinema is dead

a6O30nJ02PU,Theres only one Mr Roarke.  The legendary Ricardo Montalban.
a6O30nJ02PU,"""You can check out anytime you want but you can never leave"" the island"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Mr. Ricardo Montalban must be rolling in his grave.
Worst host ever!"
a6O30nJ02PU,OMG My Maggie Q üòç
a6O30nJ02PU,"It's copying from India film sandalwood movie name 
Give like to this than I will tell name üòâüò†"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Well that s ironic. The last time I saw a terror movie with Lucy Hale in it, her character willingly condemned human kind and this movies trailer explicitly tells us every character will get exactly what they deserve."
a6O30nJ02PU,No thanks
a6O30nJ02PU,It's so weird to see Luis talking so less...
a6O30nJ02PU,*Jing yang is in this movie ?*
a6O30nJ02PU,This ain't no another Escape Room?
a6O30nJ02PU,"Oh Portia, you're so much better than this!!
And they totally cast a Matthew Fox lookalike on purpose!"
a6O30nJ02PU,Seems more like nightmare island
a6O30nJ02PU,gonna see this for the beautiful Maggie Q she deserves some recognition

a6O30nJ02PU,Bruh I swear every trailer uses Billie Eilish or Ariana Grande
a6O30nJ02PU,....Wasn't Fantasy Island meant to be I dunno..a lot more lighter and fluffier than this?
a6O30nJ02PU,"My fantasy was to visit a fantasy island, so thanks I will leave now."
a6O30nJ02PU,Superb
a6O30nJ02PU,The guy at 1:58 kinda looks like Jacob from Lost
a6O30nJ02PU,"Potential.  But obviously not made for fans of the TV show, but for young-un's who have never heard of it.  Still a little upset about that..."
a6O30nJ02PU,"y'know normally i _like_ dark and edgy re-imaginings, but doing it to _this_ show is just too far. i mean, is _nothing_ sacred?"
a6O30nJ02PU,*Why can't you just wish for nothingness !*
a6O30nJ02PU,It's one of those movies where the top doesn't topple and keeps on rotating.
a6O30nJ02PU,"What's your fantasy ,
Me: Jesus suggesting me hentai .."
a6O30nJ02PU,"okay 7 Rings?! I WANT IT, I GIT IT. OKAY?!!"

a6O30nJ02PU,Wow thanks for ruining a classic. Mr roake and tattoo are probably rolling over in their graves
a6O30nJ02PU,...Maggie Q and Michael Pena?...take my money....

a6O30nJ02PU,Weird cast for a thriller
a6O30nJ02PU,I just seen the move it‚Äôs weird there‚Äôs no trailer for it though
a6O30nJ02PU,Are these trailers made by the same guy? With the same 20 sound effects?
a6O30nJ02PU,Better watch Island web series
a6O30nJ02PU,Where is Tattoo?
a6O30nJ02PU,why is lucy hale in all the trash movies?
a6O30nJ02PU,Willy Wonka meets lost
a6O30nJ02PU,My teacher met Lucy Hale on the set while filming this movie
a6O30nJ02PU,Yeah... not watching this
a6O30nJ02PU,Hindi dubbed needed
a6O30nJ02PU,Wow blumhouse really doing some nice new horror movies lately
a6O30nJ02PU,"Michael Pena is a terrible choice for Mr. Rourke, they should picked Javier Barden. Also, where is Tatu? This moving is going to suck!"
a6O30nJ02PU,"I would wish for ""I want to leave this island right now with $1 billion in my bank account"". Thank You."
a6O30nJ02PU,I don't see any surprises in this movie it looks like usual American wild parties.
a6O30nJ02PU,"This is metaphor for life. You get what you seek. If you seek bad it will come to you since all is one. 
Everything is Divine‚Äôs Magic"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Cheery trailer: exists
Blumhouse logo: I'm about to end this man's whole career"
a6O30nJ02PU,But whyyy on Valentine's Day??!! ü§îü§î
a6O30nJ02PU,"Yes, fantasy island is a horror movie now because that's just where we're at creatively."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Hey, it's Jian Yang, creator of the Seefood app."
a6O30nJ02PU,Luis brought an Island to scare Scott Lang and Fam. Lol
a6O30nJ02PU,I think I've already read this manga somewhere.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Loved the TV show but this remake is dark. Ricardo Montalban played his character well. The new guy just lacks in something. 
I would have liked to see something closer to the original. 
It seems like this was an easy way to go with a show considering going dark has been done already."
a6O30nJ02PU,Nothing feels better than having 7 rings as the background......love you Ariana Grande ü§©üòçüòçüòç
a6O30nJ02PU,i think chicken noodle soup is a better theme song üòÇ

a6O30nJ02PU,Nice travel action horror masala mobile
a6O30nJ02PU,I‚Äôm gonna watch cause Parisa Fitzhenley is in it and I love her
a6O30nJ02PU,Going Horror on this just isn't right. Fantasy Island was always about learning the truth about yourself and finding a new perspective. I will be passing on this rendition maybe the next remake will be more to the heart of the series.
a6O30nJ02PU,In Tamil language this tralier
a6O30nJ02PU,WOW hollywood.. So original...
a6O30nJ02PU,Blumhouse & 'Get Out' name is enough to me to see this

This was revenge from all those years of taunting and trauma from Mr. Roarke that he developed this psychosis and changed the purpose of Fantasy Island to a horrific one. I prefer this development LOL"

a6O30nJ02PU,Lucy Hale ü•∫üòçüî•
a6O30nJ02PU,Blumhouse should remake The Island of Dr. Moreau.
a6O30nJ02PU,"So they‚Äôre taking some of the subtle horror effects of the original Fantasy Island, and crank it up to 11?





Don‚Äôt mess this up Sony, or many of us will give hell! Also, just because you wish it, doesn‚Äôt mean you should make it real. As learned from the original, ‚Äúbe careful what you wish for‚Äù."
a6O30nJ02PU,"All I want to know is who says ""de plane de plane"""
a6O30nJ02PU,Well that ruined my childhood Fantasy Island.
a6O30nJ02PU,Westworld: spin-off movie
a6O30nJ02PU,The REAL horror is that the Ricardo Montalban and Tattoo are dead
a6O30nJ02PU,7 rings üòÉüòÉ
a6O30nJ02PU,Remind me of Scooby Doo return to zombie island
a6O30nJ02PU,Lomando the movie??
a6O30nJ02PU,Fantasy Island is definitely an SCP
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks like no one wont achieve thier fantasy on that island. üòÅüòÅüòÅ
a6O30nJ02PU,I love Michael Pena but come on he's no Ricardo Montalban. I hope I get the spelling right.this movie looks terrible.
a6O30nJ02PU,Super hit
a6O30nJ02PU,Well... I guess is better to turn a classic TV series into a horror movie than a comedy like that crappy Chips movie.
a6O30nJ02PU,My mans really wanted a first person experience of Vietnam
a6O30nJ02PU,so now you've screwed with a old family friendly classic?  Geezus!
a6O30nJ02PU,Yass Lucy Hale workin again with Blumhouse Productions!!!!!üíóüíó‚ú®
a6O30nJ02PU,This movie looks awesome babe!!!
a6O30nJ02PU,The gritty reboot no one asked for
a6O30nJ02PU,is tha Lucy Hale ? I Love Her üòâ
a6O30nJ02PU,This movie looks bad
a6O30nJ02PU,"By the first minute I thought it was a remake of April Fools Day, teens on an island and it‚Äôs Blumhouse Productions, a horror movie."
a6O30nJ02PU,"This isn't a fantasy island, it's a ghost island"
a6O30nJ02PU,Made a far cry 3 movie
a6O30nJ02PU,Waiting...
a6O30nJ02PU,"Hey dude, Before you comment, let me tell you that this is a fantasy,You are not commenting here.."
a6O30nJ02PU,"If my elevator door opens and it says Blumhouse, i‚Äôm not getting off the elevator ü§™ü§™ü§™"
a6O30nJ02PU,Sorry to say sony but on the same day i.e 14th feb 2020 kingsman 3 is also releasing and legends would watch thatüòç
a6O30nJ02PU,"Wait, is this based on the TV series? I was expecting romantic/comedy/adventure fantasy. I didn't expect horror flick."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Making Fantasy Island a horror movie is just about the dumbest thing you could do with this IP.

Especially considering it's basically The Monkey's Paw."
a6O30nJ02PU,Hmmmm let's see
a6O30nJ02PU,The prefect movie for Valentine's day!
a6O30nJ02PU,Ariana well doneüòÖ
a6O30nJ02PU,Does anyone understand what this movie
a6O30nJ02PU,Hindi Dubbed
a6O30nJ02PU,Definitely a hit for the Big Brother or Survivor motards...
a6O30nJ02PU,I'd rather watch Prey (2019) by Blum.
a6O30nJ02PU,OMG! It changed into horror ü§£üòÇüòç
a6O30nJ02PU,Impressive. They managed to make Lucy Hale look unattractive.
a6O30nJ02PU,I hope r u ready üëøüëø
a6O30nJ02PU,"This was my favorite TV Show back in the 80's, so I can¬¥t wait to watch the movie next year, Lucy Hale rocks."
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks like april fool day
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks absolutely terrible. Does everything that wasn‚Äôt comedy or horror have to be revised into either a comedy or horror thing?
a6O30nJ02PU,So much for enjoying a fun remake... what's next turn Love Boat into some thing horrible too... üòí
a6O30nJ02PU,"Hunh.

Is this where that Oceanic flight ended up? It would explain a lot."
a6O30nJ02PU,Interesting
a6O30nJ02PU,"Another trailer that shows way to much.  It should have ended after the woman realized that the woman in the chair was real.  This movie looks like a condensed version of LOST with the loud sounds to get the audience to jump.

I still might see it because I am curious if Verne Troyer plays Tattoo.  If they kept that secret then I think it would be worth the $10 just because they were able to keep the lid on."
a6O30nJ02PU,Boring I‚Äôll pass üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ
a6O30nJ02PU,From the director of True Memoirs Of An International Assassin and Truth Or Dare comes a big screen horror remake of Fantasy Island...hhmmmm...
a6O30nJ02PU,"This ain't like the tv show. This looks twisted. Besides, where is tattoo!?"
a6O30nJ02PU,Like for 7 rings
a6O30nJ02PU,üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
a6O30nJ02PU,"Wow this looks fun and light

Sees Blumhouse: oh"
a6O30nJ02PU,Nakita
a6O30nJ02PU,That lift scene is  like inception movieüòÖ
a6O30nJ02PU,Luis Why so serious?
a6O30nJ02PU,Why couldn‚Äôt they just remake it into a one hour show like before? ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è SMH
a6O30nJ02PU,"They made this mf into a horror movie üòÇ

So where is Tattoo? Is he a killer dwarf in here?"
a6O30nJ02PU,soo they took one cute amazing happy concept and turn it into an stupid teen slasher hostel crap
a6O30nJ02PU,This is not the Fantasy Island. I grew up with. I think I like it!
a6O30nJ02PU,KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!
a6O30nJ02PU,"Jeff Waldow, you got quite the nerve directing this. and that's a compliment.
sadly, though, that's probably the nicest thing I have to say about this movie."
a6O30nJ02PU,Where is Tattoo? The plane the plane.....
a6O30nJ02PU,"A darker take on the old TV series, or so it seems. And to be honest, that had its share of episodes that could have gone down this path."
a6O30nJ02PU,"As someone who watched the original series, hard no. This ain't even remotely what Fantasy Island was. What does twisting it gain?"
a6O30nJ02PU,I think I'll watch Joker again.
a6O30nJ02PU,What if your fantasy is to have sex with a dinosaur?
a6O30nJ02PU,All I see is Nikita on a secret mission to shut down a cult doing shady things in an unknown island.
a6O30nJ02PU,"This movie is going to suck. There can be no Fantasy Island with out a suave midget shouting ""Ze plane! Ze plane!"""
a6O30nJ02PU,"Wow. So Fantasy Island gets the horror treatment, eh? This... was not what I was expecting."
a6O30nJ02PU,Seeing Louis play a serious character is odd
a6O30nJ02PU,"Columbia Pictures, you ruined the fantasy TV show from 1977 as a upcoming horror movie.  Ricardo Montalb√°n and Herv√© Villechazie rolling down the grave."
a6O30nJ02PU,This looks delightfully twisted.
a6O30nJ02PU,"im actually excited. something creative and twisty, that doesn't push the fact that it has a female lead down our throats... *cough cough cough* every new MCU movie *cough cough*"
a6O30nJ02PU,"looks like trash, maybe an interesting concept, but needed serious rewrites and maybe better actors."
a6O30nJ02PU,Daniel Jaek
a6O30nJ02PU,"""Da plane, Boss. Da plane !"""
a6O30nJ02PU,"Oh, Blumhouse! You‚Äôve done it again..."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Hold up, i thought blumhouse have partnership with universal studios?"
a6O30nJ02PU,Nice random usage of the ‚Äúdance music‚Äù from Brian DePalma‚Äôs BODY DOUBLE at the start!   Hahahha
a6O30nJ02PU,Ooooh Sh*t.... bit dark twist on the idea. Me like.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Why the hell would people fantasized such cruel things?? A house, a car and a million bucks will be definitely awesome for me."
a6O30nJ02PU,I was expecting to see a modern Tattoo saying thee plane thee plane. ü§™ then I say the gloom House logo. ü§™
a6O30nJ02PU,WTF was that?
a6O30nJ02PU,A nice Tv series transformed into a average terror movie.
a6O30nJ02PU,Jian Yaaaannnnng!
a6O30nJ02PU,I really love that Lucy is slowly becoming a Scream Queen of this generation but she keeps on getting stuck with these B horror films lol but lets give a chance tho-- but i hope this is like the tv series before where they learn from their wishes that not everything you wish for is what you needed.
a6O30nJ02PU,Sooo I need to go to the island like now.... My life is already twisted :P
a6O30nJ02PU,"Thank you hollywood, for ruining my childhood yet again."
a6O30nJ02PU,"I didn't know I've always dreamt of working for Blumhouse, Sony, and Colombia."
a6O30nJ02PU,My fantasy is to see a movie trailer that doesn't spoiler 90% of the DAMN MOVIE!
a6O30nJ02PU,"Way to fuck up a classic and it‚Äôs original. Still going to see it, though."
a6O30nJ02PU,no need to see the movie just watch the trailer
a6O30nJ02PU,Im wondering if the bold letters in end slate means something
a6O30nJ02PU,This movie was much better than I thought it would be.
a6O30nJ02PU,Woww.. üéà
a6O30nJ02PU,1:18 NIKITA MOMENT
a6O30nJ02PU,Ze Plane Ze Plane!
a6O30nJ02PU,This looks cool
a6O30nJ02PU,Nice idea.
a6O30nJ02PU,If there is not a midget it is not Fantasy Island.
a6O30nJ02PU,NIKITA!!!!!!!!!!!!
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks like a throw away movie
a6O30nJ02PU,In 2021 Blumhouse will reboot Knight Rider into a car AI that starts our murdering people but learns to love
a6O30nJ02PU,Arianators?
a6O30nJ02PU,Maggie Q üíô
a6O30nJ02PU,Would encourage me to watch if they didn't show what happens after the protagonist realizes her fantasy is real.
a6O30nJ02PU,I see Michael Pe√±a. I upvote I mean like.
a6O30nJ02PU,"You either become a Jump Street movie, or you become a Fantasy Island movie."
a6O30nJ02PU,Interesting unique take on Fantasy Island. This horror approach will either work or fail there will be no in-between. But I appreciate the attempt to do something different with the IP this time around. And I give the trailer mad props for using Pino Donaggio's brilliant Body Double score in the first half of the trailer.
a6O30nJ02PU,Not my kind of movie. I'll watch it for Lucy Hale with blonde hair and Maggie Q. And to see what happen to the bully.
a6O30nJ02PU,"WTF  NO TATTOO ?!
not seeing it"
a6O30nJ02PU,Not one Fyre Festival joke in the comments? For shame.
a6O30nJ02PU,"1:58, anyone else think that was Odo from DS9?"
a6O30nJ02PU,üò≤üò≤üò≤
a6O30nJ02PU,"Really ""Blumhouse""? Really? Granted I've never sat through a single episode of the original series that starred the late Ricardo Montalban, but I don't it being a horror series. Looking at the Imdb on the original series, I saw it filed under four genres, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, and Drama. Nowhere did I see Horror, or let alone Slasher. Yeah, I don't like this trailer."
a6O30nJ02PU,I came here..just cus i thought this movie would be like.. Shuttler Island
a6O30nJ02PU,Awesome
a6O30nJ02PU,i am from indiaüòåüòÅüíï
a6O30nJ02PU,Hostile mix with escape room
a6O30nJ02PU,"Monkey's Paw Island.... Why bother calling it this, honestly? And you can't get Nestor Carbonell for Rourke? Not even trying."
a6O30nJ02PU,7 rings yeeessss
a6O30nJ02PU,Gotta love them using the music from Body Double in the trailer.
a6O30nJ02PU,This whole concept looks confusing. Therefore I deem it stupid lol
a6O30nJ02PU,Why does every remake now have to be a horror movie?  The original show was all about learning about yourself.  This just looks like a slasher flick.  :(
a6O30nJ02PU,So is this Truth or Dare 2 ?
a6O30nJ02PU,They are just shitting on everything
a6O30nJ02PU,"What a weird idea for a movie. Taking an 80s prime time show that had little to no horror elements, and making it a horror movie. Weird"
a6O30nJ02PU,I‚Äôm guessing they wanted it and got it.
a6O30nJ02PU,"OMG!!!! YIKES!!!!!!!

This is a commercial for a new reality show for MTV or a bad porn film. 
YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
a6O30nJ02PU,This is low key giving me Cabin the the Woods vibes though...anyone else?
a6O30nJ02PU,Better fantasize about leaving...
a6O30nJ02PU,Bora...nevermind. :D
a6O30nJ02PU,First the Banana Splits and now this! Stop tainting childhood memories already!
a6O30nJ02PU,Tbh I would‚Äôve if wished for sex so I don‚Äôt know how they could‚Äôve twisted it unless it made my parents walk in or something
a6O30nJ02PU,So when is the horror movie version of The Love Boat coming out? NO DON'T WRITE THAT DOWN!!!
a6O30nJ02PU,Isn't there a midget in the show? Where's he?
a6O30nJ02PU,Yikes first the Bannana Splits and now this . What is up with these weird non horror reboots and if not did they really just remake the 1998 remake lol. Hard pass.
a6O30nJ02PU,"7 Rings got an entire new vibe.
Lyrics don't match but the instrumental is purely creepy."
a6O30nJ02PU,This looks like DOGSHIT
a6O30nJ02PU,Amazing
a6O30nJ02PU,Bumhouse strikes again.
a6O30nJ02PU,Thanks for spoiling the plot
a6O30nJ02PU,I expected rock to be in the trailer from title.
a6O30nJ02PU,Michaell Pe√±a is a nice guy but is so so so far from Ricardo Montealb√°n!
a6O30nJ02PU,Da Pain!  Da Pain!        Meh....
a6O30nJ02PU,"""de plane!  de plane""... all I could think about is the tragic life of Herve Villechaize, and playing Tattoo."
a6O30nJ02PU,JIAN-YANG!
a6O30nJ02PU,"DA PLANE, DA PLANE!"
a6O30nJ02PU,"00:13 Elevator to Blumhouse Universe... ""Life you always dreamt of"" *in my nightmares!!!*"
a6O30nJ02PU,Is this based off of a book or something?
a6O30nJ02PU,"Da plane! Da plane!

(Sigh) I miss Herv√© Villechaize..."
a6O30nJ02PU,Excited to watch the let me explain video of this movie and nothing else
a6O30nJ02PU,1:34 Catching Fire beach from Hunger Games!
a6O30nJ02PU,I rlly like that the played 7 rings for the trailer
a6O30nJ02PU,This is going to suck like a virgin on prom night.
a6O30nJ02PU,Ah yes.......the 30 year old teenagers
a6O30nJ02PU,Why ?  First the Roddy McDowell version now this I like the Original Fantasy Island better.
a6O30nJ02PU,0:55 Hannah stocking üò±
a6O30nJ02PU,DA PLANE!! DA PLANE!!! lol
a6O30nJ02PU,Daaaaammmm that's Aowosm ü§üü§üü§ü
a6O30nJ02PU,Lucy Hale is amazing.
a6O30nJ02PU,Direction is great on side
a6O30nJ02PU,This is different from the original tv show.
a6O30nJ02PU,Now I know she helps her bully get out üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
a6O30nJ02PU,Hopefully this won‚Äôt be as bad as the Banana Splits Movie
a6O30nJ02PU,"Anyone noticing how Sony is releasing ""escape"" style movies where they're invited to something but it all takes a big turn? Escape Room, Ready or Not, and now Fantasy Island

Edit: Just Escape Room and now Fantasy Island"
a6O30nJ02PU,So no one fantasized about Batmobile or Iron Man's suit?
a6O30nJ02PU,WTF just i see..?üî•üî•
a6O30nJ02PU,Came here for Lucy Hale...
a6O30nJ02PU,Is that girl play in doctor sleep ??
a6O30nJ02PU,Doesn't look that bad tho.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Just don't like the song choice, but I guess it looks alright."
a6O30nJ02PU,NOPE.
a6O30nJ02PU,Wow now that‚Äôs a dark turn on a old tv show
a6O30nJ02PU,Can't wait
a6O30nJ02PU,Man I was thinking that this film adaptation was going to be a family film. Nothing like this
a6O30nJ02PU,First they did it with Us I got 5 on it. Now Ariana grande 7 rings cool
a6O30nJ02PU,"This one time i was running an island and this lady was like ""yo i want to take revenge"" and i was like ""would you want to kill her"" and she was like ""only figuratively not literally"" and i was like ""you'll die for wasting my time""."
a6O30nJ02PU,So a dark twist on the old show... Interesting..
a6O30nJ02PU,a reboot from 1978?
a6O30nJ02PU,Interesting concept.
a6O30nJ02PU,Jeffrey Epstein Island
a6O30nJ02PU,"Sony: How much klishe do you want in this movie?
Director: yes"
a6O30nJ02PU,I love the wicked twist on an old classic television show. üëç
a6O30nJ02PU,This is how you waste the movie by showing everything in the trailer.
a6O30nJ02PU,"Nobody:
Lucy: Tuupaac"
a6O30nJ02PU,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Imagine Michael Pina ringing a bell saying da plane! Da plane!
a6O30nJ02PU,Hollywood is really running out of ideas. What's next a Gilligan's Island psychological thriller?! A Brady bunch horror film?
a6O30nJ02PU,Omg loving this creepy remix of 7 rings
a6O30nJ02PU,That moment when jumpscares don't scare you anymore...
a6O30nJ02PU,"Seriously? This is a thing?
Ricardo Montalban is rolling over in his grave."
a6O30nJ02PU,scariest part of the trailer would be hearing Ariana's 7 rings turned into a horror soundtrack.
a6O30nJ02PU,What no the plane the plane ?
a6O30nJ02PU,Westworld + The Island = this
a6O30nJ02PU,"Sucks,, the real fantasy island was not about horror"
a6O30nJ02PU,Want to see Blumhouse tackle the Love Boat next. Ha! Ha!
a6O30nJ02PU,That great value CGI at 2:10.
a6O30nJ02PU,"So if they want to escape why dont they just get on ""da plane, da plane""?"
a6O30nJ02PU,Not seeing this looks terrible!
a6O30nJ02PU,who knows the bgm Ôºü
a6O30nJ02PU,Darlene was right all long when she said had seen Angela alive. She is actually in Fantasy Island to hide from Dark Army.
a6O30nJ02PU,Kash Bollywood bhi aisa movie banathaüò•
a6O30nJ02PU,For a second i thought i saw selena gomez in the thumbnailü§™
a6O30nJ02PU,"Holy crap this came out of left field for me.  A straight horror take on the show rather than the more ‚Äòtwilight zone‚Äô way it was written originally.  I am mildly excited.

PS.  Long live Ricardo!"
a6O30nJ02PU,Isn't that the chick from i zombie?
a6O30nJ02PU,Da plane! 0:32
a6O30nJ02PU,They really turned 7 Rings into a song for a scary movieüòÇ
a6O30nJ02PU,"I‚Äôm really glad Lucy Hale is doing more horror films. Pretty Little Liars originally had slasher elements to it, and she‚Äôs done Fear Island, Scream 4, Truth or Dare, and now this. She‚Äôs becoming a new modern Scream Queen."
a6O30nJ02PU,Sony did you learn nothing from the Banana splits movie?
a6O30nJ02PU,"Dark Fantasy Island...really. What's next, Nazi Love Boat?"
a6O30nJ02PU,All we need is the Chinese little person
a6O30nJ02PU,So Tatoo got gender swapped. Look out Arthur Fonzarelli !
a6O30nJ02PU,YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BISH IM SO FUCKING EXCITED TO SEE THIS SCREW THE BOOK I'LL GLADLY PASS LUCY HALE YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS üòç üòç üòç üòç üòç üòç

a6O30nJ02PU,"So , The Fyre Festival: movie then"

a6O30nJ02PU,Not to be confused with the tv show I guess
a6O30nJ02PU,This movie mixing of 2 flims..one is hostel and other is ....
a6O30nJ02PU,So they made a film about Jeffrey Epsteins island where the ELITES hang out the truth hidden in fiction
a6O30nJ02PU,So it's like if wishmaster was an island!
a6O30nJ02PU,"Smiles, everybody, smiles!"
a6O30nJ02PU,"So louis is in this story, it happened between infinity war and endgame?"
a6O30nJ02PU,Ohhhh FAR CRY 3
a6O30nJ02PU,"Ugh I don't remember fantasy island being this dark and gritty but then again what reboot isn't dark and gritty now and days 

Also where the hell is tattoo??"
a6O30nJ02PU,Far Cry 3 Fantasy Island
a6O30nJ02PU,It's like Montague Island Mysteries by R. Wayne Schmittberger...
a6O30nJ02PU,Story will be same as Table no-23

a6O30nJ02PU,This aint how I remember the  tv series where the dwarf dude Tattoo?
a6O30nJ02PU,Luis...?
a6O30nJ02PU,How is this a business model?
a6O30nJ02PU,Cabin in the woods remained as Fantasy island
a6O30nJ02PU,it doesn‚Äôt give the ending away I‚Äôm kinda excited
a6O30nJ02PU,Mr. Roarke might be on it. That‚Äôs just a theory that‚Äôs all.
a6O30nJ02PU,I'm getting a Cabin in the Woods vibe from this.
a6O30nJ02PU,Most definitely did not expect ‚Äú7 Rings‚Äù By Ariana Grande to get the horror movie treatment
a6O30nJ02PU,Is it me or was the song ‚Äú7 rings‚Äù the wrong song to play during the Trailer?...
a6O30nJ02PU,"It could have been an awesome film, if you hadn't shown the major plot points in the trailer."
a6O30nJ02PU,The trailer turns out to be awesome
a6O30nJ02PU,Blum house= instant low quality jumpscare trash.
a6O30nJ02PU,Would've been cool if they had a midget in the movie ..just like in the TV show
a6O30nJ02PU,Hindi dubbed
a6O30nJ02PU,Hollywood is back
a6O30nJ02PU,The childhood bully is A
a6O30nJ02PU,"So...
Take a 70s/80s TV series premise and crank it into the psychological & jump scare horror that it underlined in the TOS.

Intriguing..."
a6O30nJ02PU,Ohk.. I want It.. I Get It.. CooooolllüòÇü§£.. Lol
a6O30nJ02PU,If i was on fantasy island i would want to see shrek 5
a6O30nJ02PU,Where is Monica Bellucci??
a6O30nJ02PU,By seeing the trailer i see its more of a teen movie
a6O30nJ02PU,When I saw fantasy island I immediately thought of a animated child's movie... I was Soo wrong.
a6O30nJ02PU,You know the movie's cringy when you got an Ariana Grande song for the trailer
a6O30nJ02PU,Amazing trailer
a6O30nJ02PU,Why that Ariana grande song tho? It didn‚Äôt fit to me
a6O30nJ02PU,By the thumbnail I totally didn't expect a horror film..... üòí
a6O30nJ02PU,0:30 that's Forrest Gump's House
a6O30nJ02PU,"I mean, the visuals and the cast alone is enough incentive for me to watch this. Also, nice creepy remix of 7 Rings."
a6O30nJ02PU,Hollywood version of *Go Goa Gone* !!ü§£ü§£üòÇ
a6O30nJ02PU,why does lucy hale‚Äôs vacations always end up with murderüòî‚úäüèº
a6O30nJ02PU,All these movie trailers this week but I don‚Äôt see a blue hedgehog anywhere üòî
a6O30nJ02PU,This is exactly what happened to The Banana Splits Movie!
a6O30nJ02PU,"Nobody:
Sony: LETS TWIST IT!!!"
a6O30nJ02PU,"So, they took the classic TV series and made it into a Horror movie. :/"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Joke‚Äôs on them, my fantasy is to be brutally murdered by Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain, Amy Adams, and Margot Robbie... you know what I mean? ;)"
a6O30nJ02PU,So this is what luis was doing during the snap.
a6O30nJ02PU,"So obvious It‚Äôs based on the novel 
Fantasy Island 
 ‚Äúthe choice‚Äù   
By Chris Sgambati   
The books better. The trailer looks infantile compared to the novel."
a6O30nJ02PU,Basically the movie equivalent of the Douchebag Genie.
a6O30nJ02PU,"They want it, they got it"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Wow!!! 
Love the spin from the source material. (Was sick of baywatch, Chips, starsky & hutch, Charley‚Äôs angels BS)

A great idea. üëçüèº"
a6O30nJ02PU,That's brilliant
a6O30nJ02PU,Now I know what I am doing this Valentine's.
a6O30nJ02PU,"The ""diversity"" Island, without diversity.  Such a mess."
a6O30nJ02PU,"The sherminator.... I am the sophisticated se......

Oh wait!!

Wrong movie"
a6O30nJ02PU,Ja Rule stepped up the game on this one.
a6O30nJ02PU,WTF?  They turned my favorite show from my childhood into a horror movie?  I'll pass.
a6O30nJ02PU,So instead of casting a dwarf 2 play tattoo they cast an attractive looking woman instead
a6O30nJ02PU,First horror movie I'm genuinely intrigued by for a while.
a6O30nJ02PU,Lol love how they twisted it into a horror movie
a6O30nJ02PU,Fantasy island and no one have sex fantasies?
a6O30nJ02PU,I want to work for Blumhouse.
a6O30nJ02PU,Actually the original TV show was supposed to be darker than it turned out. And less predictable with not everyone having a happy ending. So it's kind of nice to see this. Just hope this isn't a typical slasher type movie.
a6O30nJ02PU,Well that‚Äôs gonna suck
a6O30nJ02PU,Escape room meets cabin in the woods
a6O30nJ02PU,so '7 Rings' is a psycho thriller song now huh?
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks cool
a6O30nJ02PU,"""Wow this looks fun and light!""

Sees Blumhouse: oh"
a6O30nJ02PU,"wtf, where is tatu?"
a6O30nJ02PU,I thought it was Neverland
a6O30nJ02PU,Is this the brand new movie trailer bcoz I have seen this before in my dreams or in the parallel universe??  WTF
a6O30nJ02PU,Hollywood: Hey remember when we tried genre bending Land of the Lost and it failed miserably. Let's do the same with Fantasy Island.
a6O30nJ02PU,Looks super lame and predictable
a6O30nJ02PU,"The Banana Splits Movie, anyone?"
a6O30nJ02PU,This seems insulting to Ricardo Montalban's memory.
a6O30nJ02PU,Wow it's nothing like the original fantasy island TV show from the 70 and 80s tv drama .
a6O30nJ02PU,Tatoo
a6O30nJ02PU,Micheal Pe√±a is gonna win an Oscar for Best Leading Actor. He‚Äôs a perfect actor for this villain.
a6O30nJ02PU,Ricardo Montalban and Malcolm McDowell would not be pleased with the job that Michael Pena's Mr. Roarke is doing on their island.
a6O30nJ02PU,It's no fantasy island without midgets.
a6O30nJ02PU,Not so much interesting üßêü§î
a6O30nJ02PU,"It‚Äôs based on the novel 
Fantasy Island  ‚Äúthe choice‚Äù   By Chris sgambati

a6O30nJ02PU,Once I saw Blumhouse I knew what I was in for
a6O30nJ02PU,This movie is twisting our expectations
a6O30nJ02PU,"Might watch it,  looks cool."
a6O30nJ02PU,"Well, this certainly appears to have missed the point entirely. 
Can't wait for the Horror reinterpretation of My Mother, The Car."
a6O30nJ02PU,I was hoping for Ricardo Montalb√°n and Herv√© Villechaize shout-outs.
a6O30nJ02PU,Lucy üòç
a6O30nJ02PU,"So the whole island operates on Monkeys Paw logic?
That sounds kind of dumb."
a6O30nJ02PU,Trailer music ruined it but it looks great
a6O30nJ02PU,Sony gotta be Sony when it comes to showing too much in a trailer.
a6O30nJ02PU,That‚Äôs a f‚Äôd up version of Fantasy Island

a6O30nJ02PU,Never knew 7rings can sound this creepy
a6O30nJ02PU,"No midget??
I'm out."
a6O30nJ02PU,Am I the only one who is thinking about Lost right now...????
a6O30nJ02PU,Blumhouse is just releasing movies here and there next year

a6O30nJ02PU,"Me: There's no way possible for Hollywood to kill one of my favorite light hearted TV shows growing up as kid.


Hollywood: sheeeeiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttt watch this"
a6O30nJ02PU,"Who is Toopock?!
 Sounds like a Vulcan from Star Trek!"
a6O30nJ02PU,"This seems promising. Something we have seen before, yet promising.

What is deceiving though is that they got all these comedy actors and put them in a scary movie."
a6O30nJ02PU,Blumhouse and sony is never a great thing for a movie
a6O30nJ02PU,"""But when the fantasies turn into nightmares, the guests have to solve the island‚Äôs mystery in order to escape with their lives""
Do they have to 'solve the island' or do they have to have a epiphany about themselves, let go, and move forward?
The old show and the 90's reboot the guests did have dangerous fantasies but usually had a reflection and left the island to be better people.  Still a case of 'careful what you think you want' situations and did have some dark turns but also some silly ones (variety of different fantasies meant different takes and style to them).  This seems to focus only on the horror and dark side aspects.
Don't know if Mr. Roarke wants the bad things and final outcomes to happen to the guests out of evil/ritual or does want to help the guests overcome their psychological situations with the island's magic even if it might be dark or even dangerous. 
I predict the mother will learn to let go of her lost daughter.  The other lady maybe to forgive and let go of her revenge that will end the fantasy and have her leaving to connect that woman to have a healthy talk.  The others I'll have to discover a bit more context to the fantasy and what sparked it."

a6O30nJ02PU,Why on Valentine ? this movie should have been released on Halloween.
a6O30nJ02PU,Fantasy Island is supposed to be about changing people's lives for the better. Not about a horror thriller that twists the fantasy to evil.

a6O30nJ02PU,"Could have been really cool if they didn't market is a contemporary horror film, throwing the Blumhouse name everywhere you looked. Also, ""fantasy"" is a pretty board term, but basically they've reduced it to two things: death and revenge. Boring."

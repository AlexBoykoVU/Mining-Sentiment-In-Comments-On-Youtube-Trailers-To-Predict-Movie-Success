YwHQfvY_s_Y,I am ready!
YwHQfvY_s_Y,meanwhile in non christian places of the world...
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"There is not going to  be a Rapture, It's not Biblical, not in God's word.  God's word tell us plain and simply,(a Child can understand) The Antichrist (satan) comes first (6th trump) The Real Christ comes at the 7th trump. God will not come back until after the Antichrist sits in the holy place pretending to be God.  2Thess. 2:3,4"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"It doesn't matter who's in the movie it's the message their trying to send everyone. If Cage is an atheist maybe this might change him. I wouldn't want to be here on judgment day after the rapture , this is what this is about the rapture."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Is Nicolas Cage a Christian??
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"First of all it's sad that so many people will take this ""secret rapture"" as truth when the Bible- God's Word says the opposite... Left Behind was written as fiction...what amazes me is that so many have taken a man's word over God's. There are numerous scriptures and a true prophetic time line in the Bible. Under guidance of the Holy Spirit those who are truly searching for understanding will find it. Jeremiah 29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart....

1 Thessalonians 4:16 says, For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first  vs.17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. vs.18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
Revelation 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen
Satan hates God so much that he has a counterfeit for everything that God does, including the Christ’s bright and boisterous coming in the clouds of glory! Since he really cannot compete on that scale, he’s gone underground to enshroud the event in darkness and mystery. Jesus knew of Satan’s deceptive plots and warned us in Matthew 24:26 and 27 that we would be tempted to believe that His coming would be secret
Matthew 24:3,4 As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, ""Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"" 4And Jesus answered and said to them, ""See to it that no one misleads you 5For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7“For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes. 8“But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs. 9“Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. 10“At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. 11“Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. 12“Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold. 13“But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. 14“This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
2 Thessalonians 2:10,11 and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved. 11For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, 12in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.

2 Timothy 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
Matthew 28:20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen
John 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments
Philippians 1:9 I pray that your love will overflow more and more, and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding. NLT"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"I've read the book series, twice!! ;-D  Expecting it to be depicted the way it was written. ((fingers crossed)) ☺  #LeftBehindMovie  "
YwHQfvY_s_Y,This is going to happen for real. Are you ready! 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,censor test
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"I read the book and the 12 that followed"" Left Behind,"" it's an awesome series......You never will know before it happens, so my advice to you is, repent and accept Christ as your savior and believe he died for your sins on the cross and was resurrected.  This time we have on earth is so very small compared to what our Lord has waiting for all who have been ""Born Again"".  God Bless you and I hope to see your smiling face in Heaven!"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Song?
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"This time I hope Dr. LaHaye will allow them to go further than the other ones did, they stopped way too soon.  and yes, there is some fiction in these but there is also truth from the Bible as well, more truth than fiction is in these movies and books.  Now is the perfect time to have the Left Behind series be revived.  Just look at the weather patterns all over, especially here in Hawaii, where on the Big Island we had Tropical Storm Iselle, formerly a Hurricane touch down and cause a lot of serious damage.  Now we are being threatened by a lava flow, all in the same area and I have lived here 11 1/2 years and have not seen this before, it could also be possible that Mauna Loa is getting ready for action as well, but not as soon as it would seem.  Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, flooding, famine, pestilence (Ebola), as well as wars and rumor of wars.  Jesus has told His disciples all about this in the Bible."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"the oGOD is coming to fuck ur shit up, hes gonna go all virgin mary on ur azz"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"THE WORLD NEEDS THIS SO BADLY




lol"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Looks interesting to say the least. A little different from the book and original movie. I'll probably give it a shot
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"I thought god was a loving god, sees like god is pretty mean letting people suffer, because didn't believe in him. If someone didn't believe something, does that make it right for them to have eternity of damnation? Oh but he loves us right? "
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Okay y'all take this in humor, not being insulting at all, but my thought was they should have made Chad Murray shave lol"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,@Left Behind Movie Let me prophesy to you. The rapture will have happened right before this movie turns ONE year old. Before it gets to mark celebrate its FIRST anniversary. #MarkMyWords!
YwHQfvY_s_Y,The books were good and hopefully the movies are too. The books did a good job of translating Revelations to the modern world and even non-christians should be able to appreciate the original apocalyptic story of the end of the world.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,what is the song on the soundtrack?
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Why has Hollyweird remade this movie? WHY??? Why can't you fruit loop socialists leave the classics alone? What, you so brainwashed with your socialist utopian fantasies that you've lost your creativity? Douchebags one and all."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but now I'm not sure. It doesn't seem overly faithful to the original novels. The Rapture when it happened on the plane, no one noticed it, and only slowly did people realize that half the plane was missing; also Rayford and Buck were on the same flight, but they didn't interact much until the plane made it to Chicago. When I read that Stoney Lake was trying to appeal to larger audiences, I didn't realize they meant it like this.

Still, I might go see it, I'd just have to separate the 2 in my mind, and take the movie as it's own unique story, not a retake on a classic one. (much like Godzilla 1998)"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Comedy Cult Classic!! Will this be funnier than Wicker Man and Vampire Kiss? I hope so..
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"God's coming soon. This movie shows how it might happen. Watch my videos to see His face. Get ready or get left behind, your choice."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"yay, take all the xtians away jesus!!!!"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"What a Narcissus, despot, oppressor, dictator god you guys have, can it be the Stockholm syndrome?"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"The idea of people vanishing and taken to Heaven is not found in the Bible, all through  the scripture  God is  saying saying when the saved from all ages are taken to heaven it will be when Jesus comes for them.  whoever reads this and is not sure of what the Bible teaches please read the scriptures that are given prayerfully.  JOHN 14;2,3.              MATT 27;64.   MATT 24;30,31.  THESS 4;15-17.   REV 1;7.  REV 6;14-17.  As you can see there are many scriptures  showing that the event long looked for by christians is a personal  appearing of Christ to call his people home.  I must say however that when Christ does come back he dose not touch the earth we are caught up to meet Him, its actually  one of satans  deceptions and he himself will personate Christ  MATT 24;5."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Obviously Richard Rowe has been watching too many episodes of South Park. He probably doesn't believe in Satan either. But I know for a fact that although Richard will not admit it, he is deeply concerned that his very soul could be in jeopardy of  an eternity in hell if he is wrong. Yes, the remake will more than likely water down and Hollywoodize the real premise of the storyline, but hopefully it will get Richard and others curious enough to go to a bible-based church to hear the truth about Jesus. Because he is coming back, no matter what you say or believe. "
YwHQfvY_s_Y,CHECK OUT NICOLAS CAGE 2007 MOVIE '' KNOWING '' IT WAS SIMILAR BIT WITH AN EXTRA TERRESTRIAL VIEW. ANGEL / ALIEN LIKE BEINGS CAME AND TOOK  HIS SON AND HIS FRIEND AND OTHERS AWAY AS THE SUN DREW CLOSER AND DESTROYED THE EARTH IN THE END IT SHOWS THIS SORT OF DIVINE LIKE OBJECT DROPPING THEM OFF IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE WITH THEIR TWO LITTLE RABBITS VERY INTERESTING MOVIE 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"The pre-tribulation rapture is unfounded. Scripture is quite plain about when the rapture will occur - at the LAST trump! This pre-trib theory will cause millions to lose heart and even ""fall away"" when it doesn't occur. Christians and Jews are being slaughtered all over the world AS I TYPE THIS! Tell them the rapture will occur before THEIR tribulation! Cease spreading this doctrine of demons."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,This is going to happen one day  my sister and me are the only Christians and my parents are not and I do not want them to be left behind I am in prayer for them 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,I still prefer Greco-Roman mythology over christian tales.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"All Christians disappearing in one day, sounds to good to be true."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Best Science Fiction Series of books I ever read. :-D
YwHQfvY_s_Y,HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH WHAT THE F..... Of course it would have Nick Cage.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,This looks like the worst Nick Cage movie in years. and thats saying something considering how bad the Sorcerers Apprentice was.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Christians have expected the Rapture for about 7,000,000 days now (2000 years), so it should be here any day right?"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Yeah, they should animate the Dramatic audios . . ."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Yeah, just what we need...America on the verge of creating its very own Christian Taliban, living with a Congress and government destroyed by them, every moron on FOX gunning for a New Crusade...and you idiots are releasing Christian Revenge Porn reboots? The books were sick and pathetic, the first movie was just as bad, and now...man, you got Nic Cage in on this hateful trash? Sorry, Nic...huge, long-time fan, but you lost me here. "
YwHQfvY_s_Y,omgasssssssssssss every1 just turned into a fart and floated 2 jezus
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"politicians aren't evil people 
if their were no christian politicians or republicans the world would already have fallen apart  cause of Obama. i mean really  in other countries peoples heads are being cut off cause of isis and Obama won't do anything about it.but it says in the bible those who don't believe or know god won't be saved in the rapture which i hope that I'm worthy cause I'm only 13 and i know i sin a lot but I'm trying to stop it"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"actually the movie noah had lots of false stuff in their like the guy who gets on the ark that never happend 

and also they make it seem like noah tried to kill their kids that never happened either"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,We are just people we cannot live because we are not Spirit or like The Son Of God (Jesus Christ) we deserve to die we always sin which is not good it can be a little son but it can be a very very dangerous sin so if you do sin please please confess your sin to Jesus Christ and to God and admit that you did do the sin with all your  heart and love one another even a kid that you really hate 1 John 4:11-24
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"My friends we need to love God with all and i mean all our heart , Jesus of Nazareth,and your brother or sister because if you don't its says you are a liar.1 John 4:19-21"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,People we need to believe in Jesus Christ so we can live in heaven because Jesus Christ Got Crucified Matthew 27:32-61 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"This movie (as with the Noah movie) is a deception and not biblically accurate. (Isa. 8:20). Search the scriptures line upon line, precept upon precept (Isa 28:13)."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,So tired of this doctrine of rapture. It was created in 1820. 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,what is a music?
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"I do not buy into the pretribuation therory.  If the pretrib therory is true, why are christians in the middle east and china under sever persecution.  The western church needs to go through the fire to refine it and weed out the luke warm christians.  Pretrib was startred by scofield in the 1840's and was never expressed by and of the founding chuch fathers or the apostles.  Pretrib is an acid on society, christians become passive in the and believe they do not have to be involed in the world and just can not wait to be raptured and taken away before persecution happens."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Excited to see this!
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Thank you @Left Behind Movie  for a remake i can not keep a copy of the first book in the novel collection series because i always give it away for free to introduce people to Jesus but then the movie gets brought up and kirk as wonderful he is for his fellowship that movie did the book no justice and had barely no relation. 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"As a Christian, I believe it is part of our duty to bring non-believers into Christ's Church.
One of the major pet-peeve I have about other Christians is their use of ""Bible-babble"" in public forums (like this one). All it does is confuse people who are not knowledgeable about ""Church phrases"". I see a lot of comments here talking about ""Pre-Trib"" and ""Post-Trib""... you DO realize that words like that only make non-Christians distance themselves from us? Unless you explain your phrasing, please keep it amongst the Church and those who understand what you are talking about.
Thanks."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,This looks good. I hope this will get Nick Cage back on track. That in the process he will come to realize the Truth.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,So can't wait to see this movie! 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"the first 3 ""Left Behind"" movies were already made, staring Kirk Cameron. What, now because they star Nicolas Cage, they are going to make it to the theater? Or is it because of how obuma is destroying the country and its making it more believable, and Nicolas Cage is just a bigger name?"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,I love the book series!  I wonder if they are going to put all seven books in one movie or will there be other parts like some movies have been made.  It would be wonderful if they can do the whole series.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,it's release is October 3rd.   Are you ready??  When it does happen I for one do not wish to be left behind.. I believe in Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and that He died for our sins on the cross on Calvary.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,I hate to rain on everybodys parade about this movie but this has already been done and it was the official version by the authors. LaHay and Jenkins. I doubt they had anything to do with this one. seems to me with all the hype I am getting it is nothing more than Hollywoods attempt to capitalize on a great movie and remake it in their image to sell tickets and accessories.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Just watching the trailer makes me wonder why some were taken up but others who seem to be good-hearted people trying to do the right thing were left behind. I thought only evil people such as murderers, rapists, politicians, etc would be left. Silly me."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"They are making a remake from the original Left Behind movie series smh 
"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Nice movie but it be more than just a movie if someone can show me where exactly does this ""Left Behind"" is mentioned in the Holy Bible?"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Jesus is coming again.  There will be a Rapture.  That Rapture happens at the Second Coming.  But the Rapture is not an event separate from the Second Coming.  There will be a separation of believers from non-believers (the meaning of one taken and another left-similar to what occurred in Noah's day, Matthew 24).  But the notion of people snatched away and others left behind with cars and planes without drivers and babies removed from hospitals is not supported by Scripture. But Jesus will come again, so be ready."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Are all the Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, etc. left behind?  Are we who are not Christian all left behind?"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Well this is the first trailer that doesn't make the movie look like garbage. However, we'll never get the left behind movies we want..."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Well this is the first trailer that doesn't make the movie look like garbage. However, we'll never get the left behind movies we want..."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Civil Twilight - Letters From the Sky for everyone who's wondering 
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Bad theology yields with bad movie. :-/
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Cuanta gilipollez religiosa.  Joder, dejaros de soplapolleces con dios. ¡Sed mas realistas!"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"Over 4 million people have seen our new, full-length trailer.  Have you?  
 #leftbehindmovie  #areyouready?"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"@Gordon Brogan I see you disabled the comments,because your too wuss to be corrected.Nice try,Dikut."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"I only hope that this one turned out better than the Kirk Cameron version, which was simply awful."
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Great
YwHQfvY_s_Y,Looks like a decent film. better than the first trailer Good cinemetography too. Chad michael murray is a better actor than kirk cameron. looks closer to the book too.
YwHQfvY_s_Y,"the song is ""Letters From the Sky"" by Civil Twilight. SO GOOD!"
YwHQfvY_s_Y,The leftovers: the prequel
YwHQfvY_s_Y,I so dont give a s***

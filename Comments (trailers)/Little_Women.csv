AST2-4db4ic,"Oh GREAT !
1800's CAPTAIN MARVEL....
With LEFTIST  STREEP .....
I'll pass thank you very much."
AST2-4db4ic,"Next time Hollywood remakes the movie, they'll inject lesbians, a transgender, and add a black or yellow person in it as well. Why get creative, just take an oldie and change the character"
AST2-4db4ic,Will Jo and Laurie end up together in this version?
AST2-4db4ic,Sophia Lilith has the face for Jo and I think she‚Äôs the right age too
AST2-4db4ic,"I looooove this story, even though my favourite movie is the first one from 1949 (classic...) I always watch everyone is made, so I will watch this one too!! It really looks great!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"""I want to be great or nothing!! ""




Why do I hear these lines more clear than anything else!! üò¨"
AST2-4db4ic,Looks Rubbish Winona Ryder best version
AST2-4db4ic,They should of got Moe Szylak to narrate
AST2-4db4ic,"The next Feminazi film. No, thanks."
AST2-4db4ic,This is what the Poe sisters were up to before Ganondorf took Hyrule.
AST2-4db4ic,I haven‚Äôt been this excited for a movie in a long time
AST2-4db4ic,Is this specifically based on the book or a remake of the 1994 movie?
AST2-4db4ic,"Holy cow, this is the girl from the lovely bones. I love that movie and I‚Äôm proud of her üëèoh shizzles it‚Äôs been a while üòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,i love the fact that her last names march and march is women's history month
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl is perfect for the role of Aunt March.
AST2-4db4ic,"""I want to be great or nothing' 

Inspiring one‚ù§Ô∏è"
AST2-4db4ic,Hey you. Yea you scrolling thru the comments. What are you waiting for. Read the book its amazing
AST2-4db4ic,Oh I love Joe she is so sweet and in the book shes so nice
AST2-4db4ic,Yessssss. I read the 500 something page book a few years ago when I was 10
AST2-4db4ic,"Has anyone have an idea what is the song that goes from 1:03 to 1:20 ? 
I am dying to knooooow"
AST2-4db4ic,Okay can some one tell me who is this guy at 1:38 ?
AST2-4db4ic,"""You'll need to marry well!""
""But you're not married-""
""Well that's because I'm rich!""

Same energy as Cher's quote from an Interview:

""My mother always told me to marry a rich man and I said 'Mom, I am a rich man!'"""
AST2-4db4ic,poor emma watson shes done now!  hey lets KEEP REMAKING MOVIES! THATS AN ORIGINAL IDEA!!  looking forward to little women 2022
AST2-4db4ic,I wish Indonesia would be fast to put this movie on cinemas
AST2-4db4ic,:)
AST2-4db4ic,if jo and lawrence arnt gonna be together imma start a riot
AST2-4db4ic,Beth dies
AST2-4db4ic,"I went to a super conservative Christian school from elementary to my freshman year of HS. If I hadn't read Little Women or Anne of Green Gables, I feel like I would have a completely different view on  women and femininity and a whole lot of internalized misogyny."
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know the song on the trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,This looks beautiful. And this is what a remake should be. A new adaptation and a retelling with a new feel and point of view on the novel.
AST2-4db4ic,"Little Women (1994) was done so, so well. If you have not seen it, please do so. I won't say anything negative against this remake, since I haven't seen it, and mainly because I know so many people put so much into it (cast and crew), yet, PLEASE do not undermine the greatness of the 90's adaptation. It is beyond worth seeing. It is the reason I value being an extra in Stranger Things (to say I worked on the same set as Winona Ryder, who touched my heart as Jo, when I was 5). I'm looking forward to the new adaptation, but PLEASE everyone watch the '94 Little Women...you won't regret it. It goes above and beyond expectations, relatabilty, and soulfulness. Claire Danes, Christian Bale, Susan Sarandon, Gabriel Byrne....."
AST2-4db4ic,"i will not be seeing this movie, not because there are women in it, but because there are men"
AST2-4db4ic,This story really didnt need to be remade with just a different set of white people
AST2-4db4ic,"of course the ""quirky"" ""independent"" ""free spiriteD"" girl gets the cute guy. its never any other way lmao"
AST2-4db4ic,"Last time I read Little Women was about 10 years ago, so now I'm rereading it to prepare for watching the movie. Im about a third of the way through the book, and it makes me very happy that I can already identify specific scenes I remembered reading. That is all :)"
AST2-4db4ic,"is 25 dec is the worldwide release or just in states? why there's not poster or anything like that yet on my country, i'm so affraid that they not gonna release it on my country"
AST2-4db4ic,I'm Still upset with Amy in 1994. How dare she burn Jo's book up! üò°
AST2-4db4ic,kok gua ga inget scene pas lagi nonton teater nya dh
AST2-4db4ic,Just for Emma üòç‚ù§
AST2-4db4ic,Are timoth√©e et saoirse's characters gonna be together in the movie???!
AST2-4db4ic,I am definitely looking forward to seeing this. Awesome casting. I hope the screenplay rises to the same level as the acting talent.
AST2-4db4ic,anyone know the song name at the end? Thanks !!
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson: queen of book adaptation moviesüòç
AST2-4db4ic,Literally timoth√©e chalamet is so fricking hot and no one can tell be different
AST2-4db4ic,I like Meg and Jo! üòâ
AST2-4db4ic,Of course they have to add modern feminist spins into it lol
AST2-4db4ic,"It's been DECADES since I read the book, but I don't remember Meg wanting to be an actress."
AST2-4db4ic,I want more of that 1:35 - 1:42
AST2-4db4ic,Nice try Meryl but Kathrine Hepburn was right about you. You're too fake to take part in a story like this.
AST2-4db4ic,"Question: is this movie only out on Christmas Day and then they‚Äôll no longer play it again, or was I just imaging that? I would LOVE to go see it but if that‚Äôs the only day it‚Äôs out ‚Äî I won‚Äôt be able."
AST2-4db4ic,Can you please tell me.... There are three little women movies. . Is this a continution Or something? Should I watch that to understand this..and where can i see this movie
AST2-4db4ic,"""I believe we have some say over who we love.""
""I think the poets would disagree.""
wow. please stop sleeping on this."
AST2-4db4ic,"2:14 melts me, every single time."
AST2-4db4ic,Statistics yo
AST2-4db4ic,1:38 is SO real i cant wait to watch this scene
AST2-4db4ic,does anyone else think that the actress for Amy is a little too mature to play the role for the youngest sister? I can see it as Amy is older but not as the little Amy.
AST2-4db4ic,Any feminists here?
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm never going to be able to watch this without crying
AST2-4db4ic,The eye roll in the end by Jo Says it all...
AST2-4db4ic,I really like how the main logo of the film isn‚Äôt using a predictable cursive font. It feels modern
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm sure I'm going to love it because Little Women is one of my top 3 favorite books, I've read it dozens of times, but just from watching the trailer, I already see deviations from the book and that makes me unhappy hahaha. But I still have faith!"
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson still can‚Äôt act by the looks of it
AST2-4db4ic,This movie is SO amazing üòç
AST2-4db4ic,Aaaaaand dislike
AST2-4db4ic,Why do we need another one?
AST2-4db4ic,Tim others voice in the trailer is so calming üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Made me think of Joey and Rachel.
AST2-4db4ic,The Anime is much better ....
AST2-4db4ic,She sounds like the girl that is on tik toküòÇ ‚Äúguys like pterodactyls‚Äù üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,"My heart while watching the trailer: *Saoirse Ronan* Yess
*Emma Watson* YESS
*Timoth√©e Chalamet* YESSSS üòç"
AST2-4db4ic,What an All Star Cast they got here.
AST2-4db4ic,‚ÄúI want to be great or nothing.‚Äù
AST2-4db4ic,How come they never talk about how racist a lot of white women were (and still are)? We need more films about that.
AST2-4db4ic,I just watched the 1994 one and I fell in love with it . And I already fell in love with this one just watching the trailer.
AST2-4db4ic,"""Little women? How little are they?"""
AST2-4db4ic,"I wonder if Jo will marry Mr. Baehr, like in the book, or if they'll write his kind and interesting character out for the sake of giving Jo a ""strong independent"" feminist life."
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait to see it!!üòÄ
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl Streep is completely in command of her performance as the mother of her ambitious and independent minded daughters
AST2-4db4ic,"I am so longing to watch this film! Saoirse, Emma, Florence, Meryl ... It can¬¥t get any better!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Guys, these girls names are just like the Poe sisters names in Ocarina of Time video game.. Amy, Beth, Jo (elle), and Meg..!!!! Am I the only one who noticed?"
AST2-4db4ic,"From a four sister family, this story has always resonated with my family.‚ù§Ô∏è"
AST2-4db4ic,im a sap for this story so i think i will love it :)
AST2-4db4ic,Such a coincidence of how I am reading this book and it's in my recommendations ü§î
AST2-4db4ic,"""My name is Suzie Salmon, like the fish"""
AST2-4db4ic,"SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN‚ÄôT READ THE NOVEL

The line that Jo (Saoirse) says about how she‚Äôs ‚Äúso sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for‚Äù and that whole monologue wasn‚Äôt in the novel. However, those were actually Louisa May Alcott‚Äôs words (the author of ‚ÄòLittle Women‚Äô). She said it in response to her fans who kept asking why she finished the novel with Jo ending up with Friedrich instead of Teddy and how Jo choosing to keep her independence would still have been a better ending (I‚Äôve seen this adaptation and it addresses and answers why Alcott had to end it that way.) Greta Gerwig chose to add it in the script as ‚ÄòLittle Women‚Äô is partly auto-biographical and based Jo off herself."
AST2-4db4ic,This movie gonna make me cry I can already tell.
AST2-4db4ic,"""Hated it"" you have to be an In living color fan to get it. Lol"
AST2-4db4ic,little woman 1994 is the best how ever this trailer seems to be adding things that weren't in the book not the beach scene but a few others also i don't much care for the new jo but maybe i will after i watch the movie
AST2-4db4ic,Is there anyone else who has seen the original anime?
AST2-4db4ic,Are they making Beth the youngest???? Amy is the youngest??? Also while I love how much respect Amy juice they drank where is the Beth rep?
AST2-4db4ic,They liberalised this movie. Loiusa May Alcott never wrote those lines. They turned it into typical feminazi garbage.
AST2-4db4ic,"Not sure about this version ü§îü§îü§î
Prefer the susan sarandon version"
AST2-4db4ic,"There is no fucking chemistry between Saorise and Timmy, they have more of a sibling energy between them! Can't anybody else see it?!"
AST2-4db4ic,Try 1994 version
AST2-4db4ic,does anybody know the name of soundtracks in this trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,"and this makes how many ""little women"" movies now???? man, come on..!! Can we get a movie that has not been done already several times. Does no writer have originality anymore!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Who else is furious and sad because the movie won't come out for another two months In their country
AST2-4db4ic,"I remembered reading the sequel of this novel. ""Little Men"" it was beautiful"
AST2-4db4ic,I can‚Äôt wait to watch the movie
AST2-4db4ic,It seems like a painted movie
AST2-4db4ic,what's the song that plays at 1:43 ?? i love it
AST2-4db4ic,I'm so excited for this movie!!!
AST2-4db4ic,I would prefer Judy dench or Maggie Smith
AST2-4db4ic,How many times are we gonna make this movie?
AST2-4db4ic,I'm here for Emma....bt i can see her hardly
AST2-4db4ic,best movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,emma watson timothy chamlet AND meryl streep in the same movie? my life‚Äôs complete.
AST2-4db4ic,It always reminds me of Racheal & Joey!
AST2-4db4ic,Will not watch because Meryl Streep; she hate our President Trump. Send Meryl Streep to a socialist country with all the other haters. Vote Dem Out....
AST2-4db4ic,"Who's the fan of ""Lady bird"" ?"
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,This will be a great movie to watch/
AST2-4db4ic,"Okay I love Emma Watson, and I‚Äôm going to see Little Women regardless, but omg her American accent is so bad. I‚Äôm hoping her accent isn‚Äôt as bad as the trailer shows it to be throughout the whole movie"
AST2-4db4ic,But Emma Watson was perfect for Jo
AST2-4db4ic,the background music is the best!
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know the background song?
AST2-4db4ic,"This  trailer is impossibly basic, to be frank. This romanticization of aristocracy is bourgeoisie propaganda at its most crass.

Talk about another reason why funding & institutional support for cultural production desperately needs to be directed beyond this kind of political + class homogeneity. Who benefits from *more humanizing + centering of rich white settlers in this moment in history? Women or otherwise. Give thanks for our capacity for complex analysis. To not get fooled into calling something 'feminist' just b/c women or girls are involved when what's actually happening is the perpetuation of white supremacist, classist, colonial biases."
AST2-4db4ic,Why Emma didn't do press with the rest of the cast?
AST2-4db4ic,"Me watching a trailer: ‚ÄúUgh that guy is so cute!‚Äù 
Me watching THIS trailer: ‚Äúwow I‚Äôm such a LeSbIaN!!‚Äù"
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the song at 1:03 when jo and Laurie are dancing and towards the end?
AST2-4db4ic,1:35 I replayed this more times than I like to admit
AST2-4db4ic,0:48 this cracked me up üòÇüòÇüòÇ definetly this would be my future.
AST2-4db4ic,"I have a feeling this will be another man hating movie lol another all female movie to cater to sjws...still mad trump won so hollywood is making more female and people of color movies now....i luved the 1994 version but ill skip this, and im a woman..."
AST2-4db4ic,It's sad I can't watch this film in my country :/
AST2-4db4ic,"*HEYYYYY THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE LOL, especially the 1994 version one*"
AST2-4db4ic,The original is one of my favourites. I‚Äôm so excited for this one!
AST2-4db4ic,"laura dern, florence pugh, eliza scanlen, AND meryl streep? does that mean a man is about to be MURDERED?"
AST2-4db4ic,EMMAü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
AST2-4db4ic,Dope!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Damn this trailer always makes me tear... can‚Äôt wait to see this film.
AST2-4db4ic,saoirse ronan is no Winona Ryder and Emma Watson is no trini Alvarado. Thank you but no thank you.  That tiny bit was enough to tell me it's just going to be more overacting by the both of them.  I'm all set.  I know the 1994 version wasn't the first. I've seen them all and read the book I love the story. I feel like the 1994 cast nailed it and this will pale in comparison.
AST2-4db4ic,Damn that‚Äôs an all-star cast if I‚Äôve ever seen one...
AST2-4db4ic,I didn't actually want to see this. Nothing will top Winona for me. But I'm interested now!
AST2-4db4ic,it's just the trailer and i'm crying‚Ä¶
AST2-4db4ic,the soundtrack for this is gna take over my life soon
AST2-4db4ic,"Why has Timoth√©e not been nominated for anything this year for Little Women or The King? And for an Oscar last year for Beautiful Boy? I wonder if he‚Äôs not playing by Hollywood‚Äôs sinister rules. If you don‚Äôt know what they are, look it up. But if it‚Äôs true, I like him even more!"
AST2-4db4ic,I love how multicultural and diverse it is
AST2-4db4ic,It was absolute perfection. Love love loved it!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Beth diesw
AST2-4db4ic,really excited for this one
AST2-4db4ic,"while I love Emma Watson and do think she's very talented, she also really needs to work on that accent lol"
AST2-4db4ic,HATE how they use modern speech in movie that's portraying time of Civil War in America
AST2-4db4ic,Leave the classics alone!
AST2-4db4ic,I've always dreamed of writing a little women retelling
AST2-4db4ic,I want to see it i love little women
AST2-4db4ic,This is the whitest movie I ever seen in my life
AST2-4db4ic,rich white girls love this movie
AST2-4db4ic,ITS HERMINOE GRANGER FROM HARRY POTTER EEEK EMMA WATSON
AST2-4db4ic,"Finally, a movie that will show how little, women actually do in the world. Enjoy the pun. Can‚Äôt wait to see this cringefest"
AST2-4db4ic,1:04 does anyone know the name of the background music? I fell in love with it.
AST2-4db4ic,watch this space lmao thisll come out and be massive BET
AST2-4db4ic,A great trailer to open for a great movie and great book ‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Did the people who made this even read the book?
AST2-4db4ic,emma üòçüòç
AST2-4db4ic,"the actress that plays joe sooo looks like Winona Ryder, the actual Jo in the movie of 1994. I can‚Äôt wait to see that to see that"
AST2-4db4ic,I thought Samuel  L Jackson was going to be in this remake... wasn't there a scene when he shows up as Nick Fury and starts screaming at everyone??
AST2-4db4ic,Another film... l must say the 1949 and 1994's film adaptations were unforgettablly  the best.
AST2-4db4ic,waiting üëÄüëÄüëÄ
AST2-4db4ic,where. is. Louis. Garrel?
AST2-4db4ic,"Why is Jo Irish and Meg English? I know the actors are in real life, but it sounds like they didn't even attempt to use American accents in this. I'm confused..."
AST2-4db4ic,"I have the book and the author is Louisa May Alcott
I know because at the start of the book, it said ‚ÄúChristmas won‚Äôt be Christmas without any presents!‚Äù And there was a Christmas tree in the tralier"
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know the second song in the trailer???
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know the second song in the trailer???
AST2-4db4ic,"I LOVE  Saoirse Ronan but she doesn't pass for English in looks or accent in any of the clips or trailers I have seen. And Timothy doesn't pass for a love interest because he looks like a young boy. This movie did not need to be re-made so soon. Winona and Christian were perfect. This feels more Nickelodeon than complimentary to the last and best version. Greta, you are too young to try to make this project. All you are doing is showcasing new young stars rather than casting the right actors."
AST2-4db4ic,This movies about what?
AST2-4db4ic,"But will anything ever surpass March Family Letters? In any case, I love Saoirse Ronan, I hope she does as well as Winona Ryder did in 1994."
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan is beautiful and an incredible actress üé≠üíï
AST2-4db4ic,"2 words 
timoth√©e chalamet 
üòçüòçüòç"
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúBut you aren‚Äôt married aunt...‚Äù
‚ÄúTHATS because I‚Äôm rich.‚Äù 

Meryl is killing it."
AST2-4db4ic,Ohhh I loved this book as a kid...biggest crush on Jo. Her wildness shouldn‚Äôt be tamed
AST2-4db4ic,"I am so excited for this movie, I watch the trailer so many times and it gives me goosebumps and a smile every time"
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma Watson, Meryl Streep.  I'll pass."
AST2-4db4ic,I AM SCREAMING
AST2-4db4ic,you simply cant show me that kind of raw chemistry between saoirse and timothee with me knowing how it ends. you simply cant.
AST2-4db4ic,Why can't Jo and Laurie be together it's really maddening ugh
AST2-4db4ic,"Greta Swedia haaaaaaaaaaaaa ,global warming"
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm sorry...but NO! The only Little Women movie that should exist stars Winona Ryder, Christian Bale, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes and Kirsten Dunst...just to name some of the amazing cast. This movie could NEVER compare..."
AST2-4db4ic,I don't know if I will like it. It feels as if the story evoke a sense of feminist ideals. The older version with Wynona focus only on the lives of four women and how they lived their lives. This new version seems like going towards women's rights or suffrages.
AST2-4db4ic,"Meryl Streep, Laura Dern, Ronan, Chalamet, Watson, Pugh!!!!! This is an ALL-STAR Oscar-wining cast!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Based on ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù? They understate the point. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äú Little Women‚Äù at all! If you loved the work of Louisa Alcott, have read the classic work and seen previous films that are truly based on her work and expect to find that enchantment here you will be disappointed. This is a revamping, a repurposing of Alcott‚Äôs work. I really wish they would have just not used Alcott‚Äôs work in this way."
AST2-4db4ic,Greta Gerwig is amazing.
AST2-4db4ic,"Tis the season, another winter where I rewatch a Greta Gerwig film trailer over, and over, and over again."
AST2-4db4ic,Little women fans consider watching Anne with an E on Netflix season 3 comes out January 3rd you won‚Äôt regret it
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm sorry but no ‚ÄúLittle Women‚Äù adaptation will beat 1994s one. Christian Bale and Winona Ryder! The acting and storytelling is too beautiful!
AST2-4db4ic,None of the actors for the March sisters are Americans. Just saying.
AST2-4db4ic,"Omg, I remember I used to be watching The Tales of Little Women anime ver... Now there is a movie? Can't wait"
AST2-4db4ic,I'll stay with the 94 version thank you very much
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl Streep... No thanks. I'm out.
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of it!‚Äù üòÇü§£üòÇ wow, lost me right there. Looks nowhere NEAR previous versions. Sad!"
AST2-4db4ic,I always loved that Jo refused to  be Laurie's manic pixie dream girl.
AST2-4db4ic,One day they'll make a Little Woman movie that actually resembles the book.
AST2-4db4ic,I have watched this trailer so many times I can't WAIT
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚Äôm hoping this could bring attention towards the show Anne with an E as it is very similar and shares the same ideas. 

Please consider watching the show on Netflix , season 3 is coming on January 3rd ‚ô°"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm sorry but you just can‚Äôt remake the masterpiece of the 1998 version!
AST2-4db4ic,Florence did a marvellous job in Midsommar. I can‚Äôt forget the scene where she mourns her parents death and bf cheating scene. Damn this cast looks AMAZING. I just recently realized Sanorise is a gem
AST2-4db4ic,This movie is from a storybook! Omg
AST2-4db4ic,"I keep on watching the Winona version, but THIS...would likely give it justice. It's perfect cast!"
AST2-4db4ic,To everyone complaining: just don't watch it. Simple.
AST2-4db4ic,"You're not married
""Well that's because I am rich""

hoping to use that line one day to my brown family"
AST2-4db4ic,This is so nostalgic!! I can't wait already üò≠ü•∞ü•∞
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait for this film. Lady bird was awesome
AST2-4db4ic,"FINALLY, A MOVIE ON THIS GREAT BOOK I've been reading meg jo beth and amy the modern retelling of little women and i saw this and i was excited"
AST2-4db4ic,I'm gonna say it: This film will not be the same without a young Christian Bale at the helm
AST2-4db4ic,The talent is seeping thru
AST2-4db4ic,No
AST2-4db4ic,In the book they are young teens but now they are adults.?
AST2-4db4ic,"Who else is in love with the song they put on the 2nd part of the trailer, it weirdly brings me to tears...I don't like that it does that to me lol"
AST2-4db4ic,Me: Saoirse Ronan and Emma Watson? TAKE MY MONEY!
AST2-4db4ic,What's the song at 1:45
AST2-4db4ic,Why does Beth look the youngest in this? It should be Amy
AST2-4db4ic,"Beth is really really sick..... 
Jo‚Äôs there but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything she could do"
AST2-4db4ic,Omg My Favorite Actresses on here I am going to see this Movie its Beautiful
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson is bacc!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,i love it
AST2-4db4ic,Does Saoirse keep her Irish accent?
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know the music?
AST2-4db4ic,Feminst propaganda at its finest.
AST2-4db4ic,Florence Pugh is a masterpiece
AST2-4db4ic,Anybody crying it ruined it for themüòÖ
AST2-4db4ic,"Omg so many great actresses in one movie, so thrilled about this"
AST2-4db4ic,Only watching for Timmy
AST2-4db4ic,Looks way better than Charlie's Angels
AST2-4db4ic,"Who has READ Little Women?üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hit like!"
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚Äôm so excited for this!!
Did anyone else notice that none of the actresses playing American girls are American! I don‚Äôt mind - just funny! They all do an amazing American accent üòä"
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúBut you weren‚Äôt married to-‚Äú
‚ÄúTHATS BECAUSE IM RICH!‚Äù"
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson happy birthday party sisters
AST2-4db4ic,VERY BORING LITTLE WOMEN
AST2-4db4ic,Florence Pugh has been killing it this year!!
AST2-4db4ic,if they had casted maggie smith as the aunt then i would have died happy
AST2-4db4ic,"WINONA FOREVER!!!! 
THIS IS TRASH"
AST2-4db4ic,is this the one with John Johnson (Troy Bolton‚Äôs dad from HSM) in it??
AST2-4db4ic,WATCHING FOR TIMOTHEE AND EMMA
AST2-4db4ic,"1:59 bruh, gay"
AST2-4db4ic,I'm interested in the  movie because I love the book and many of the actors in it. The language in places is too modern for the time period that the events take place in.
AST2-4db4ic,Incoming flop
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee is the most attractive person I have ever laid eyes one
AST2-4db4ic,F‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢N‚Ä¢D‚Ä¢S fans knows that Beth dies.

AST2-4db4ic,hA Louisa May Alcott is my like removed cousin uwu not joking she actually is :p
AST2-4db4ic,I see that she is rejecting mr timothee but does that mean she doesn‚Äôt get with him
AST2-4db4ic,"This actually looks promising! I have loved Little Women ever since I saw the Winona Ryder version. I‚Äôve read the book and seen 2 other modern adaptations as well as clips from the older versions. I questioned another adaptation just because there‚Äôs already so many, but with all of these amazing actors and actresses, I am ECSTATIC!"
AST2-4db4ic,What about Mr. Bhaer ???
AST2-4db4ic,1:34
AST2-4db4ic,"1:57 I actually cried in the theaters when I got to this part in the trailer. It's so emotional, so powerful, and as an advocate of women's rights, that statement resonates with me so much! :)"
AST2-4db4ic,"1:43
I‚Äôm watching it, buUrRnN"
AST2-4db4ic,"I love Saoirse Ronan, she's an awesome actress.
Amo Saoirse Ronan, ela √© uma atriz incr√≠vel. Brazil here üåπ"
AST2-4db4ic,They're never going to beat Little Women 1994. And I'm not being biased at all :P XD
AST2-4db4ic,0:43-0:51 ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs because i‚Äôm rich‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WATSON üòòüòòüòò‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
AST2-4db4ic,"You do know that little women is another way to say girl, right?"
AST2-4db4ic,Will this be in select theaters or everywhere?
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the song throughout the trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,"am i the only one confused as to why amy looks older than beth in the trailer? in the books, isn't amy supposed to be the youngest?"
AST2-4db4ic,I think the ending should be different. Lol suprise viewers.
AST2-4db4ic,this movie is gonna be my favorite of all time i already know it
AST2-4db4ic,Guys I‚Äôve watched this trailer so many timessss
AST2-4db4ic,Anybody know the name of the music? It's stunning!
AST2-4db4ic,Ronan is taking lead rather emma shockedüò±
AST2-4db4ic,"The music @0:09 is ""Wawa By The Ocean"" from Mary Lattimore"
AST2-4db4ic,Florence Pugh does a great american accent but can‚Äôt say the same for the others.. :/
AST2-4db4ic,I adore the 1944 version! Probably one of my favorite movies of all time.
AST2-4db4ic,Music?
AST2-4db4ic,ok but has anyone watched this trailer so many times that they've memorized it??? or is that just me??
AST2-4db4ic,They've turned my beloved ladies into stupid feminists propaganda! Why? This isn't fair.
AST2-4db4ic,Cant waitüò§üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,This gives me anne with an e vibes
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know what song is playing in the background? It's super enchanting.üòÖ
AST2-4db4ic,Laurie and Jo üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,Watching this because of Florence!
AST2-4db4ic,"Honestly, Emma would totally fit jo's character too."
AST2-4db4ic,"Another class ruined by third wave feminist BS. Why can't we get new during female stories? Why must the films made almost always have to stand on the shoulders of a prior classic, usually one made by and starring men?"
AST2-4db4ic,Wow interesting how timothee is the only guy in the trailer
AST2-4db4ic,"Horrible casting, they swapped Meg and Jo. Come on guys, Jo¬¥s DARK hair had it¬¥s own plot point when she sold it to raise the money"
AST2-4db4ic,I like it already
AST2-4db4ic,"""Beth dies."""
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm sad jo and laurie won‚Äôt end up together üò≠

AST2-4db4ic,"Meryl Streep, Emma Watson and timothee chalamet... Will be the death of me"
AST2-4db4ic,Prefer the 1994 movie sorry a another remake Who as scrapping by Hollywood
AST2-4db4ic,Press 3 on your keyboard for pure joy
AST2-4db4ic,Who else has seen this like 100 times and is more and more excited each viewing??
AST2-4db4ic,"1:43 Eliza Hamilton, is that you????"
AST2-4db4ic,Laurie looks like another girl...
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait to see this but I'm struggling to see Laura Dern as marmee
AST2-4db4ic,why is amy so old
AST2-4db4ic,Can‚Äôt beat the original
AST2-4db4ic,The original is my favourite film of all time and the book is the book I first fell in love with as a child... Please do it justice üò£
AST2-4db4ic,"I wrote my bachelor thesis about this book, it will forever have a special place in my heart ‚ô•"
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee is like the hot version of freddie highmore but freddie is cute also
AST2-4db4ic,So Oliver is no longer in the picture huh?
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait for Amy and Laurie üòç
AST2-4db4ic,What about a great expectations reboot? Loved the 90s one..but maybe find a perfect cast for that one..helena bonham carter for the old lady role
AST2-4db4ic,"""Just because my dreams are different from yours doesn't mean they're unimportant."" Favourite line."
AST2-4db4ic,Blonde Jo is so sad for all us brunette writer ladies out here :(
AST2-4db4ic,This movie is going to be a huge classic
AST2-4db4ic,2:00 well women are also fit for the kitchen and making sammiches so...
AST2-4db4ic,This is so crazy to me!! Im reading the book which was passed to me
AST2-4db4ic,"I only knew Watson because of Harry Potter, I didn't know the rest."
AST2-4db4ic,So is nobody going to talk about how Emma Watson still has her accent while playing Meg?
AST2-4db4ic,But she should be married in the end she marries Mr. bear
AST2-4db4ic,booring emma
AST2-4db4ic,"""Joey? You wanna put the movie in the freezer?"""
AST2-4db4ic,Love how no one here is actually American üòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,"When you read the book and patiently waiting for this movie to come out because of Rachel and Joey, it does seem a bit pointless since I knew the ending already üòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,SERIOUSLY NO WAY
AST2-4db4ic,I hope they give Beth a role
AST2-4db4ic,"But your not married 
Well that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm rich"
AST2-4db4ic,winona ryder always be jo
AST2-4db4ic,Emma is self partnered in this movie
AST2-4db4ic,No indication about their father being in war and their hardship times... I thought I'd read the novel well
AST2-4db4ic,Joey is gonna be so excited and Rachel!!
AST2-4db4ic,What's the name of the song for the trailer? Please and thank you!!
AST2-4db4ic,"Whole film in the trailer and from the looks of it, it's the 1994 movie with better cameras"
AST2-4db4ic,this is going to be a modern classic can‚Äôt wait to see it
AST2-4db4ic,Who read the book and hated Amy???
AST2-4db4ic,Still prefer Winona as Jo. Still prefer 1990s version of Little Women...
AST2-4db4ic,they better not f it up
AST2-4db4ic,"i am from the future.

saiorse ronan is winning an oscar for this movie."
AST2-4db4ic,"I read the book and loved the original movie I think I'll love this one to!
(So is this a remake?)"
AST2-4db4ic,Best trailer
AST2-4db4ic,Am I the only one who had this book?
AST2-4db4ic,"Sort of guessed Emma Watson would be cast as Jo. I think it will be interesting to see her interpretation of Meg. Meg is an underrated character in the film versions of this story in the past, and even in the book, Alcott kind of brushes by her. Now that I‚Äôm writing this, Watson is just the right person to bring Meg to life."
AST2-4db4ic,"0:08 her voice is similar to the voice of Jonna Jinton, I thought it was her üòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson should have been made Jo march
AST2-4db4ic,Why is everything with Emma Watson a must see?!?! Damn I love this woman
AST2-4db4ic,I like meg and joüòä
AST2-4db4ic,Where's the professor????
AST2-4db4ic,what's song in this trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,"I grew up on the original film from early nineties, (starring a much younger Kirsten Dunst, Winona Ryder, and Claire Danes) and cant wait to view this in cinemas this Christmas. Gorgeous, timeless story."
AST2-4db4ic,"This looks great, but I don‚Äôt know if it will live up to the one with Wynona Ryder and Susan Sarandon."
AST2-4db4ic,It will be interesting to see if Emma can hack it on screen alongside an actress as talented as Saoirse.
AST2-4db4ic,"Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!
And also cant wait to saoirse win an oscar for this movie üé•"
AST2-4db4ic,i'm gonna cry
AST2-4db4ic,I like Saoirse... but she's no Winona Ryder
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl Streep plays a Meryl Streep type
AST2-4db4ic,Beth dies!
AST2-4db4ic,"I've been obsessed with this scoring, anyone knows the title?"
AST2-4db4ic,This is one of the best story I have read in my life. And I am looking forward for this movie to watch....I can't wait to see it.
AST2-4db4ic,the casting !!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"why is there 4 girls, should there be 2 girls 2 boys 1 ""White 1 Black 1 Asian 1 1LBGQT+++++, I expected this to be modernized like every other male-driven story is of late, seems only fair. of course the LBGQT+++++ must be the male, must forget that."
AST2-4db4ic,i can't stop watching this trailer .. suckedddd in completely
AST2-4db4ic,I wonder why they didn't include Professor Bhaer
AST2-4db4ic,I frickin love the books so much and now they are making a movie with my favourite actors??? ARE U KIDDING ME???
AST2-4db4ic,is there a closed captioning option to view this lovely trailer?  please hold the boomer jokes xo
AST2-4db4ic,I recognize nothing from the book besides the names. Woke movie for loveless single spinsters.
AST2-4db4ic,Music at 0:55?
AST2-4db4ic,Beautiful
AST2-4db4ic,Funny that Saoirse is playing the older March when Emma Watson is at least 4 years older than her. It's probably because she's taller.
AST2-4db4ic,i m looking so forward for this movie!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"so many oscars in a movie
üòçüòç"
AST2-4db4ic,Anybody watched the anime?
AST2-4db4ic,That aunt march bit had me laughing. but she was married she's now a widow I wonder if that's what she meant that she's rich enough to not re-marry. I looked at bits of the books but I watched all the anime which I loved.
AST2-4db4ic,Music while Jo and Laurie are dancing: *Wasting Time - Katie Herzig*
AST2-4db4ic,They were so oppressed.
AST2-4db4ic,Fuaaaack? Is this another woke and go broke movie produce by Japo's.
AST2-4db4ic,Is weird how similar saoirse and timothee look in this...
AST2-4db4ic,"It would be a great movieü§ó
I am so excited"
AST2-4db4ic,Song at 1:23 - ‚ÄúFinder‚Äù by Cyrus Reynolds
AST2-4db4ic,I love the music playing at the beginning of the trailer when they're dancing. I need to know what it is!
AST2-4db4ic,Mmmm...it will have to be impressive to beat the 1994 version. Not sure why a new film was necessary.
AST2-4db4ic,"Okay so, I need an entire box of tissues per book, and this seems like it combines the first two books of the series, and I am already moved by this trailer, exactly how many tissue boxes do I need???"
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee dancing is so adorable üôÉ
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone know the song of the beginning?
AST2-4db4ic,"timothee chalamet:

AST2-4db4ic,Man this trailer is better than an A in physics !!!
AST2-4db4ic,"If you love this movie, I highly recommend ""Anne with and E"" series! They precious but also show so many important issues in not so aggressive way but clear enough for people to understand how important the issues was and tbh some of them still are today..."
AST2-4db4ic,"Just because my dreams are different than yours,  doesn't mean they're unimportant - Meg March üíõ"
AST2-4db4ic,Its like watching anne of green gables..
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse ronan and emma watson in the same movie? I am totally gonna watch this
AST2-4db4ic,I think I'm gonna reread the book again as a countdown till the movie is released! So excited for this!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"""Can we put this movie in the fridge?""
--Joey"
AST2-4db4ic,I mean how would Joey put this in the freezer üòï
AST2-4db4ic,"I watched the trailer fully expecting to  hate it because no new version can live upto the original, but now I cant wait to watch this film"
AST2-4db4ic,omg timothee needs to stop playing games and marry me already
AST2-4db4ic,Great Christmas present!
AST2-4db4ic,"No one can beat Winona Ryder, Gabriel Byrne, Christian Bale, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes and Susan Surandon!"
AST2-4db4ic,"2:30

AST2-4db4ic,How can a studio put out garbage( Charlie's Angels remake) and a masterpiece (this movie) at the same time üôÉ
AST2-4db4ic,Tim is so fine with characters from medieval or 90's
AST2-4db4ic,ctm!!! amo
AST2-4db4ic,I'm sooo excited
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone know whats the song for this part? 1:02
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WITH AN ENGLISH ACCENT MAKES ME SO UWUWUWUWUUW

AST2-4db4ic,"Beth is really really sick,I want to keep this trailer in the fridgeüòí"
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WATSON DOESNT AGE.
AST2-4db4ic,Is little women about feminism?
AST2-4db4ic,feminism interjected into little women? no thank you. stick to the classic or better yet just read the book
AST2-4db4ic,"I am currently reading the novel and I'm 200 pages from finishing. So far, I am in love. I cannot wait for the movie. I want to see how they portray all the lessons learned, the heartfelt experiences, and everything that makes this nobel worth reading. I really like it, and I usually just read novels with action or fantasy in them. This novel has its own action and fantasy type feeling"
AST2-4db4ic,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS. REREADING THE BOOK FOR THE NTH TIME AND REWATCHING THE 1994 VERSION!!! THIS NEVER GETS OLD.

AST2-4db4ic,watched it last week and loved it so much! excited for december to watch it again!
AST2-4db4ic,"Nooooo :( :( :( Have you seen the 1994 version? Little Women is about so much more than feminism. It's about charity, family, selflessness, poverty, faith, sacrifice, duty. Pleeeease don't turn Alcott's masterpiece into a soulless piece of political virtue signalling!

Sorry, but this is not Little Women."
AST2-4db4ic,"Well, that gave me a great cry. And full body chills. Hold my seat for Christmas Day!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Today I found out that I have to play Amy in the show a theatre are doing

AST2-4db4ic,kinda prefer emma and timothee tho
AST2-4db4ic,Little women was one of my favorite books as a young teen and the film with Winona Ryder was on of my favourites. I'm excited for this.
AST2-4db4ic,"All the other actors Bravo. 
Meryl Streep is the least reason to watch."
AST2-4db4ic,"I died, i'm officially dead :')"
AST2-4db4ic,"SPOILER





'Beth Dies.'

AST2-4db4ic,I am sooo excited for this film
AST2-4db4ic,It looks boring.
AST2-4db4ic,Why did they remake this

AST2-4db4ic,This is gonna be the best movie ever!
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the first song in the trailer called?
AST2-4db4ic,Why does Emma get roles? She can't act :l.
AST2-4db4ic,Y E S
AST2-4db4ic,I'd be so sad if Saoirse & Timothee don't end up together in real life ‚ù£Ô∏è They're just so perfectly meant for each other

AST2-4db4ic,YES FINALLY
AST2-4db4ic,THIS CAST IS ICONIC
AST2-4db4ic,"Wish they wouldn't make Laurie that hot boy next door type. The book made me see as this fun, mischievous lad trying to grow wildly and boldly and passionately! Which is why Teddy is the perfect nickname for him"
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan's performances are powerful and remind me of Emma Thompson's. I look forward to this!

AST2-4db4ic,"I...did i miss something? i watched the Christian Bale version when I was a kid, and and now that I‚Äôm watching this trailer...I honestly don‚Äôt know how Jo didn‚Äôt fall in love with Laurie with the passage of time. I‚Äôm just going to have to read the book and analyze it because I‚Äôm pretty sure at this point that there‚Äôs more to just ‚Äúmaking my own way‚Äù between those two. Someone enlighten me otherwise, please"
AST2-4db4ic,"The sisters are supposed to be teenagers, right  (Emma Watson is 29 years old.) The casting in this movie was so much more about marketing than pure casting for the character."
AST2-4db4ic,why emma is not main character ?????
AST2-4db4ic,oh fuck im going to cry arent i
AST2-4db4ic,I luv dis novel!!!! And they are going to make another movie of it!!!( there was a classic version of this movie)

AST2-4db4ic,this trailer makes me cry every time i watch it. so excited!
AST2-4db4ic,Did they even show Friedrich? Searching IMDB...
AST2-4db4ic,"2:28 So, who does she marry?






Not Laurie"
AST2-4db4ic,the amount of times i‚Äôve watched this trailer is frightening
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson 7u7
AST2-4db4ic,wow this looks beautifully out of this world. Greta deserves so much praise for her work!
AST2-4db4ic,"(For people who have never read the books... don't read my comment)

Laurie was one of my favorite characters in the book. I was so ticked when Jo broke his heart. I loved her character and ambition, but... she could be so stubborn sometimes I wanted to wack her over the head. The scene when he confesses is gonna run all over my feels. And Beth? *cries a waterfall* she and laurie were my absolute favorite."
AST2-4db4ic,"I've watched this trailer atleast about a 100 times
So excited for the movie!!! Can't waitt!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Now if only Emma Watson wasn‚Äôt in it !
AST2-4db4ic,Another little women adaptationüòë
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm glad they made at least a partial u turn on the way Marmee, Beth's death and Bauer's admonitions all combine to break Jo's independent, 'unfeminine' spirit with '' some spirits are too lofty to bend'' rather than the advice to swallow her anger and live for others."
AST2-4db4ic,Something wrong with gender equality
AST2-4db4ic,All my fav actress in a movie üòç
AST2-4db4ic,At least it's not Little Women: Atlanta.
AST2-4db4ic,OMGGGG!!!!!!!! TIMO AND LADY BIRD. SICK OF THIS LOVERS :(
AST2-4db4ic,this gives me chills
AST2-4db4ic,Omg im so excited! This was a movie me and my sisters grew up watching with my mom. It was always little women or the secret garden‚ù§
AST2-4db4ic,"These little women..How little are they ? 
- Joey üòÖ"
AST2-4db4ic,No edited by credit?
AST2-4db4ic,Ironic if this is a love story when that‚Äôs the one thing the author didn‚Äôt like
AST2-4db4ic,I can‚Äôt wait!!! I‚Äôm SO excited for this!
AST2-4db4ic,Why am I crying in the club rn
AST2-4db4ic,Laurie üòî
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚ÄòM LOSING MY MIND. I didn‚Äòt know who Timoth√©e Chalamet was until I saw Call Me By Your Name like a week ago, now I‚Äòm seeing him Everywhere and only now realising he‚Äòs in this too - I saw this trailer ages ago and was like ‚Äôeh, dunno who he is‚Äò"
AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse, Greta, and timothee are in the Illuminati. It‚Äôs been confirmed how else would we be blessed with more of this iconic trio"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm really excited for this
AST2-4db4ic,I've watched this trailer so many times I can say all the words to it
AST2-4db4ic,I don‚Äôt like the Laurie
AST2-4db4ic,It's hard for everybody to accept the fact that Lawrence and Joe are not together so I hope in this movie they're going to work hard on making the Lorenz Amy storyline acceptable
AST2-4db4ic,I want to be great or nothing I'm sorry are you guys just ignoring that line
AST2-4db4ic,"Marmee: there some things to lofty to bend
Joe: hold my pencil"
AST2-4db4ic,What song is playing at 1:04 ??
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma watson if nominated for next year oscar 
Me:- Finally jury find someone who literally deserved Academy"
AST2-4db4ic,I only came to see Emmma
AST2-4db4ic,"Ugh I loved this movie so much growing up. It's a classic!! Wynona Ryder, Christian Bale, Kirsten Dunst, and Susan Sarandon. I think this will be a really great adaptation!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"it was important for Jo to lose Laurie. She was at such a complicated level, that one move against her, chose a pact."
AST2-4db4ic,Tim's voice üòç
AST2-4db4ic,i cri when i remember the spoilers from Friends.
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚Äôll be honest. Despite having a stellar cast I was unsure about this movie. And then I saw ‚ÄúFrom Great Gerwig. Writer/Director of Lady Bird‚Äù

200% sold. Lady Bird is one of my favorite movies of all time"
AST2-4db4ic,I smell oscars.
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Emma? Im going for this
AST2-4db4ic,"I feel like such a bad feminist because all the while Jo was giving her beautiul, inpiring speech all I could think of is how she didn't marry Laurie"
AST2-4db4ic,2:19
AST2-4db4ic,Will this be showed or available in Philippine Cinema?
AST2-4db4ic,My heart genuinely cannot take another time when Jo and Laurie aren't together
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson for best supporting actress
AST2-4db4ic,"The 1993 version of Little Women with Winona Ryder, Christian Bale, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes  and Kristen Dunst will always be the best."
AST2-4db4ic,Omg i can't.. just remembering that Beth will diedüòû
AST2-4db4ic,Goddamn the score in this trailer is just fantastic.
AST2-4db4ic,This looks underwhelming
AST2-4db4ic,I almost cried and it's not even out yet!
AST2-4db4ic,All of my life I've been waiting for this to be adapted to a movie...
AST2-4db4ic,Emma needs more liiiiiness
AST2-4db4ic,"Sorry, that was supposed to say ‚ÄúJo made the right decision when refusing Laurie."
AST2-4db4ic,"If people want Jo and Laurie to get together then they totally don‚Äôt understand Jo at all.  Jo made the right decision when refusing Jo.  She loved him like a sister and a friend.  She knew she couldn‚Äôt ever be a society wife and she hated gossip and small talk.  In the end Jo found a man who both loved her and respected her talent as a writer.  The Professor cherished Jo‚Äôs unconventional aspirations and encouraged her to write honestly from the heart.  And, when Aunt March died and left Jo her house, the Professor helped her to make her dream of running a boy‚Äôs school a reality.  They had a harmonious and fulfilling marriage, ran a successful school and Jo was able to be a wife, mother and writer.  Any and Laurie were also perfect for one another.  Jo and Laurie remained the best of friends.  Perfect ending."
AST2-4db4ic,What is that uplifting music when Aunt March said ‚ÄúJo is a lost cause‚Äù and then they show Jo and Laurie dancing? PLEASE I NEED IT SOOO MUCH!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,This reminds me of Colette and I am so frickin excited
AST2-4db4ic,"Am I the only one who doesn't get how this is the same as the book. Laurie never confessed to Jo, Amy was 12, Beth was about 13 or 14 and Aunt March never said Amy was the last hope. I'm so confused...."
AST2-4db4ic,Of course it has to be political and ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù. *sigh*
AST2-4db4ic,I love love love...love this.....
AST2-4db4ic,I can't wait to watch this movie
AST2-4db4ic,This looks like the little women Joey Tribbiani was talking about in friends..??
AST2-4db4ic,üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
AST2-4db4ic,I think I'm gonna cry! ü•∫ü•∫ü§ß‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,This looks terrible lol.
AST2-4db4ic,"I remember crying in Beth's death and stop reading the book, because of how miserable I felt, everything just seemed sooo wrong for me."
AST2-4db4ic,"Looks like they will make her end up single, I notice lately many movies are taking this route by showing you don't need a man yada yada. I'll watch it because I love the 1994 version. Love Bale but there is something about this young guy. Well I hope they don't make Saoirse the new Emily Watson, an incredibly talented actress that has never won an Oscar. Can't wait to see this"
AST2-4db4ic,"The original 1994 was better. This remake seems too focus on ""I'm a woman hear me roar!!""  The original was not in your face. Subtle and more feminine."
AST2-4db4ic,When's Little Men coming out? If they make that after this one I will be so happy! That's had a book for years and no one's done anything with it! It would be a perfect sequel to this too.
AST2-4db4ic,"So, Emma Watson is not the lead actreess?? üòê"
AST2-4db4ic,Woah... novel yg kubaca sampe 4 jilid. ada filmnya...
AST2-4db4ic,"I love this movie ,and i love Winona ryder and i love Joe march ."
AST2-4db4ic,I need to see it right now
AST2-4db4ic,Reading the book for the first time! Can‚Äôt wait for the movie
AST2-4db4ic,0:33 Mischief 1:00 manage(d)
AST2-4db4ic,my childhood üíõüíõüíõ
AST2-4db4ic,"Me: sees Emma Watson 

Also me: YYYYYESSSS"
AST2-4db4ic,I instantly thought of joe from friends when I saw this trailer what will he do if he watchs this movie üòÇ i m so excited ! One of the greatest books
AST2-4db4ic,Dude that one line from Saoirse made me tear up what an actor
AST2-4db4ic,*Beth dies*
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"""Well that's because I am rich!"" I aspire to be this hag someday lmao"
AST2-4db4ic,"Man, I expect Rachel doesn't spoil this to Joey"
AST2-4db4ic,I'd love to know who composed the music in the trailer it's very lovely and moving <3
AST2-4db4ic,I can already tell this movie is going to blow my socks! Loved the one from the 90s.
AST2-4db4ic,Hasn't this movie been made 2 or 3 times already.  I tried reading the book but very quickly lost interest
AST2-4db4ic,I used to fantasize about a movie in which Saoirse and Emma would be lovers from 19th century. May be this is the filtered answer of my prayer.
AST2-4db4ic,"From the director of lady bird
And from the actor of lady bird"
AST2-4db4ic,Nothing can compete with the 1990s version.
AST2-4db4ic,I like meg and jo
AST2-4db4ic,So excited! Now I have 2 movies to watch with my family during the winter; Noelle and Little Women. I received the whole collection of written books in the little women series last Christmas and now the 2019 movie is coming!
AST2-4db4ic,Why does amy look like the oldest?
AST2-4db4ic,"Just for Emma Watson ‚ô•Ô∏è
The Hogwarts girlüòÉ"
AST2-4db4ic,I think this movie is by a feminist
AST2-4db4ic,Greta Gerwig still can‚Äôt pay rent
AST2-4db4ic,"Who want this trailer and movie in hindi 
Plse like its a pole"
AST2-4db4ic,Am I the only one who will watch this movie because Emma Watson is involved?
AST2-4db4ic,"Only here for Emma :-)
Ps no hate towards other actors it is just that i love emma wayy too much"
AST2-4db4ic,"Could any one tell me what does laura dern says in the end? Is it ""there are some nature's of they depend""? What does it mean?"
AST2-4db4ic,What is the music playing in the background?
AST2-4db4ic,Cue the Oscar nominations
AST2-4db4ic,Greatness or nothing y'all
AST2-4db4ic,when will they finally start to promote this movie? i can't wait to see new emma watson and saoirse ronan interviews out there
AST2-4db4ic,Why do i get feelings of pride and prejudice
AST2-4db4ic,Beth's the secret villain all along. Just you watch.
AST2-4db4ic,Not sure if worth the watch. Rachel alrdy spoiled the end for me üòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,literally cant wait to watch this movie. i mean come onnnnn all my fave actors and actresses are here :D
AST2-4db4ic,I look like the movie's gonna be center on Jo‚Ä¶I'm so excited to watch it
AST2-4db4ic,Looking forward to watching it
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan is truly an amazing actress!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Would have loved to see Winona in it ‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Just bcoz my dreams are different doesn't means they r not important
AST2-4db4ic,well i think this movie will be my best movie
AST2-4db4ic,"After some great performances by Saoirse Ronan in the past (Atonement, Brooklyn, Lady Bird) Little Women just might give the golden trophy to her next year. But we also have to take note that Ren√©e Zellweger's performance in Judy is out of this world. I'm praying for the best for Saoirse and next year's Oscars might be another tight match in the acting categories. So many great films today with great performances üíú"
AST2-4db4ic,"As for Timothy I would like to say ""Call me by your name"" ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
AST2-4db4ic,When is it released
AST2-4db4ic,well looks like my next favorite movie
AST2-4db4ic,Oscar here she comes
AST2-4db4ic,"I was watching ""Friends"" yesterday  and watch that same episode where Joey was reading the book that Rachel gave him ""Little Women"" üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,I think I'll watch this because of Florence Pugh.
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôve got a reason to wait for Christmas!!
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA OMGü§©
AST2-4db4ic,Gotta write my life story
AST2-4db4ic,anyone else know little women from friends???üòÇüòÇüòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,Isn't that midsommar's protagonist?
AST2-4db4ic,"Its finally saroise ronan and timothe chalamet in a movie again, and another fresh feminist movie which set in old historical era, is something that we'll waiting for"
AST2-4db4ic,"In the novel there are 5 sisters.
Were is the other one?"
AST2-4db4ic,Wow
AST2-4db4ic,I remember reading this when I was y and how amazing it was‚ô°
AST2-4db4ic,"The scene on the hill when Laurie was ""confessing his love to Jo"" got me thinking. At first I thought that was when he was asking her to run away because he got mad at his grandfather, but I'm pretty sure that happened in his room, and I caught the words ""I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo. I couldn't help it""  So I'm assuming this will be kinda different from the books but still the same at the same time. Though I couldn't ask for a better cast!"
AST2-4db4ic,Wait there making another one
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúI want to be great, or nothing!‚Äù 
People aren‚Äôt talking about that line enough!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Because Emma. For Emma Watsonüíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíì
AST2-4db4ic,Can‚Äôt wait for this movie!
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the music in the trailer? I‚Äôm crazy about it
AST2-4db4ic,emma kakakku
AST2-4db4ic,Not Christmassy enough üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,This trailer is awesome!
AST2-4db4ic,What's Laura Dern's line at the end? I can't understand what she's saying for some reason.
AST2-4db4ic,"I watched the old movie so many times and I love it so much that I don't think I can go see this one and not find it disappointing, no matter how great it might be"
AST2-4db4ic,"I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd wanna see this and only watched the trailer bc of Emma Watson, but after watching this.. I‚Äôm FOR SURE gonna see it. Looks great üí´"
AST2-4db4ic,The best adaptation of Little Women is here. This is what we deserve!
AST2-4db4ic,Emma watsonüòçüòçüòç
AST2-4db4ic,I am down
AST2-4db4ic,"Ok I can‚Äôt vouch for the historical accuracy of this because I‚Äôm not an expert, but as a born and raised Mainer, I can see just from this trailer that Greta captured what New England is like‚Äì the culture, the natural beauty, the weather, the vibe. It really looks like home, and it‚Äôs nice to finally see a movie that understands New England as a setting."
AST2-4db4ic,Reading the book first. It‚Äôs great!
AST2-4db4ic,"the music in this trailer slaps
update: one of the tracks is ""Wasting TIme"" by Katie Herzig (thanks Shazam) and another is ""Finder"" by Cyrus Reynolds (thanks Neha)"
AST2-4db4ic,"""Well that's because I'm rich"" is the best line.üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,Hey this video was uploaded on my birthday. I know this is early but my life is complete.
AST2-4db4ic,:  )
AST2-4db4ic,Calling it. This is going to get Saoirse her 4th Oscar nomination.
AST2-4db4ic,Did I actually cry ??
AST2-4db4ic,Bout time they made one
AST2-4db4ic,Oscar Thirsty Film all the way
AST2-4db4ic,What song at 1:04 ?
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma Watson is just perfect for Meg, thats honestly what I'm focused on"
AST2-4db4ic,A definite in the Popsugar 2019 reading challenge for me!
AST2-4db4ic,omfg i have to watch this ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
AST2-4db4ic,The first three seconds where he says their name already show so much character
AST2-4db4ic,bb <333
AST2-4db4ic,"This is more true to life than Dickinson, a character who is playing the charcter Jo written in her pages.  

I might actually go see this one."
AST2-4db4ic,i can't wait!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,I can't stop watching this trailer
AST2-4db4ic,"Talented ladies, Florence Pugh is killing it this year. Emma Watson is slaying my life since the Philosopher's Stone and Saorise doesn't need an introduction."
AST2-4db4ic,How many movies based on the same book do we really need?
AST2-4db4ic,Greta gerwig and the cast ‚ô•
AST2-4db4ic,It's like Ronan was born for this role.
AST2-4db4ic,"i know nothing about this movie. but Hermione ,Dani from midsommar and Ladybird as sisters. im in."
AST2-4db4ic,I loved 1994 version and I will also love this one
AST2-4db4ic,I came to see Saoirse as Jo with her hair cut. Where is it ?üòÅ
AST2-4db4ic,I freaking love lady bird but ngl this looks like Oscar bait to me...
AST2-4db4ic,May someone please share the titles of the background music in this trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,I loved Christian Bale and I hope I love Timothee as much
AST2-4db4ic,Girls put your damn hair up!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,But I ship Jo and Laurie üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,"Everything is wonderful, except for the ball dresses!!!!!!!!!
What happened to those dresses!!!!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,I cant wait for this its going to be great
AST2-4db4ic,"Propaganda for feminism. A disgrace to the ethereal novel. I'm glad the March family wasnt ground up by daycare and divorce. Men and women are equal in importance, not capability.  Long live homemakers like Marmee who prioritize their children and husbands"
AST2-4db4ic,"""these little women, they're WOAH"""
AST2-4db4ic,You‚Äôll be always Hermione for us üíñ
AST2-4db4ic,Which theme/song plays from 1:40?üò≠üò≠üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,Emma watson is more famous than any on the cast members in Asia.. coz of her people gonna watch it here
AST2-4db4ic,"So we have an aspiring writer, actress, painter....is the fourth sister a singer or dancer? I like how they have artistic dreams, it's very sweet"
AST2-4db4ic,1:29 just because I sound like someone off Derry Girls doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm unimportant.
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalament playing lovers that don't end up together and Emma Watson doing another terrible American accent? Groundbreaking.
AST2-4db4ic,Never another Winona Ryder sorry Sony
AST2-4db4ic,"Jo is mah favorite character, who's yours?"
AST2-4db4ic,I still haven't recovered from her rejecting Christian Bale. Now she's going to reject Timothee Chalamet. I won't be able to take it. They have to stop casting gorgeous men to play Laurie.
AST2-4db4ic,Ne zaman nerde ba≈ülƒ±ƒüƒ±
AST2-4db4ic,T√ºrkler nerdesinizz
AST2-4db4ic,Emmawatson is here who came for that?
AST2-4db4ic,This brings me nostalgia of reading the story
AST2-4db4ic,What a beautiful melody
AST2-4db4ic,Film looks great aside from the forced message of feminism.
AST2-4db4ic,I'd watch that movie
AST2-4db4ic,"So... is Mr Bhaer not in this one? Because I always thought Mr Bhaer was the worst character in the books. Not necessarily as a person, just. In the way he was responsible in what happened, with Jo not becoming a writer after all and stuff. I'd stan it if he wasn't in this one."
AST2-4db4ic,Young Amy's voice is not young at all :<
AST2-4db4ic,What's with all the downvotes from the incels? Greta Gerwig is an amazing director and writer as is Sarah Polley so I'm no sure how anyone who claims to love film isn't looking forward to this.
AST2-4db4ic,Terrible tarrible horrible movie
AST2-4db4ic,I'll just stick to the 1994 version.
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson is so overrated.
AST2-4db4ic,OH THEY'RE COMING.
AST2-4db4ic,JO MAMA
AST2-4db4ic,"I feel like Emma represents more of Jo than Meg, especially after the HeForShe campaign and stuff, but I still think this will be a great movie with all these amazingly talented actors."
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait to watch it!
AST2-4db4ic,Lol I‚Äôm only here for Timoth√©e
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse will finally get her Oscar for this role!
AST2-4db4ic,"I got goosebumps by the end of the trailer. Saoirse is a classic actor. She brings life in a new way to everything she portrays on screen. Ladybird, Brooklyn and now Little Women. You go, Girl!! Meryl, Emma, and others are just wonderful addition to this movie. I hope it gets here in India."
AST2-4db4ic,Unorigional comment about how they cant come up with new ideas for tv shows and movies.
AST2-4db4ic,Gotta feeling this one is flop..
AST2-4db4ic,"I think Emma Watson could have been perfect for playing Jo's character. After all , Hermione was also a character of firm belief."
AST2-4db4ic,I literally freaked when I saw Meryl Streep. She‚Äôs such a legend‚ù§Ô∏è.
AST2-4db4ic,Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of the decade- prove me wrong
AST2-4db4ic,Beth dies
AST2-4db4ic,Amazing movie!!
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Timothee are the next Kate and Leonardo‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,beth dies.
AST2-4db4ic,So I'm gonna be crying again over jo not ending up with Laurie? AND WHEN LAURIE IS TIMOTHEE CHAMALET?
AST2-4db4ic,"As much as I looove lil timmy T, Im glad they removed him from the thumbnail and put the women instead."
AST2-4db4ic,I already booked the tickets to see this three times
AST2-4db4ic,Who will be professor Bhaer?
AST2-4db4ic,I can‚Äôt wait for this
AST2-4db4ic,i wish they would have casted a younger amy too for the first part of the book
AST2-4db4ic,"I remember meg sell her hair to get money cause their father is sick :((
Sorry for my bad English"
AST2-4db4ic,Can't believe a classic novel that i've ever read when i was 14 become a film ugh
AST2-4db4ic,Can‚Äôt wait
AST2-4db4ic,Love this!
AST2-4db4ic,"This casting has me so excited, I can't wait to see this!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Just goes to show how well Winona Rider fit as Jo, when the remake has an actress that looks exactly like her."
AST2-4db4ic,Can somebody please tell me what soundtrack they use in this trailer ?
AST2-4db4ic,Can‚Äôt wait to watch this and see Jo breaking Laurie‚Äôs heart AGAIN ! üòàüò≠
AST2-4db4ic,Little women? How little are they? Are they like scary little !!??
AST2-4db4ic,Very nice üíöüíöüíöüíö
AST2-4db4ic,I will watch this movie when it come out only because of meryl streep
AST2-4db4ic,"Damn, that Emma Watson accent is atrocious, who signed off on that?"
AST2-4db4ic,"ey Sony, Where is Sonic?

im his fan actually,when his trailer came out,I was so happy"
AST2-4db4ic,Why does Amy look older than Beth?
AST2-4db4ic,"Three Little Women and a leftwing feminist with almost no acting talent....and please dont say she was great in the Harry Potter series....she wasnt,the only decent actors in those movies were the ones that played Voldemort,Snape Mad Eye and Sirious Black. And maybe Prof. M!"
AST2-4db4ic,"ok, lezbeans, lez git goin'...."
AST2-4db4ic,This movie will be epic!
AST2-4db4ic,I just finished reading it!
AST2-4db4ic,"Beth dies


Joey *gasps"
AST2-4db4ic,better than twilight.
AST2-4db4ic,Can‚Äôt wait for this
AST2-4db4ic,"""Beth is really really sick"""
AST2-4db4ic,anyone know what the music is?
AST2-4db4ic,I wish I could shave Emma Watsons armpits for her
AST2-4db4ic,It hurts me knowing that Jo never married to Laurie
AST2-4db4ic,So white
AST2-4db4ic,The romantic in my soul lapped this up like chicken noodle soup. I love the music too.
AST2-4db4ic,Men arent hating this movie? Huh its almost like it only happens when you replace male characters.
AST2-4db4ic,I will wait for LITTLE WOMEN 2; JO'S BOYS
AST2-4db4ic,"I like this, but I'm probably gonna skip cause I know what it was like for Black women & other women of color in the 1800s."
AST2-4db4ic,They chose the best actor's ah!
AST2-4db4ic,1:50 - 2:05 that‚Äôs sent shiver down my spine it was so... strong.. and you can feel her distress and her emotions.
AST2-4db4ic,"Everyone always talks about Jo as ""ahead of her time!"", ""an original feminist."" And then show her as a man-hater, which is exactly not what she is. (And of course don't forget our obligatory straight, white, male whose sole purpose in life is to squash our intrepid heroine's dreams! 'Cause that's reality.)"
AST2-4db4ic,Looking forward to seeing this.
AST2-4db4ic,"Can‚Äôt wait to see if this version does the book justice as all I‚Äôve seen is the 1994 which was only saved by Christian bale. It is absolutely nothing like the novel, and the characters have no substance which is quite disappointing. I have hopes for this Jo as the ‚Äò94 Jo comes across as a romantic and sentimental which our girl is not."
AST2-4db4ic,Gracias por este hermoso regalo de navidad
AST2-4db4ic,I wonder if they‚Äôre going to stick to the og ending

AST2-4db4ic,You mean Meryl Streep is making a movie in which every other word is not a curse word? And she's not praising sexual predictors while hating Trump and his deplorable's.  This deplorable won't be watching because of her. But mainly I'm sure they'll ruin it.
AST2-4db4ic,"I loved the end about a woman being more than just for love and marriage, but I‚Äôm also scared it‚Äôs going to be hyper-feminist and anti- men. We‚Äôll see."

AST2-4db4ic,I really hope Emma Watson doesn‚Äôt end up ruining this like she did with Beauty and the Beast. Her American accent wasn‚Äôt terrible but I‚Äôm still wary. Guess we‚Äôll see when the movie comes out!

AST2-4db4ic,you they've run out of material when they remake movies that were already hits before they decided to remake them. this shits getting old. the original was perfect so why mess with perfection when you can just rerelease the original.
AST2-4db4ic,"Another fkn remake,  this is fkn ridiculous"
AST2-4db4ic,i don't want anything but you.

AST2-4db4ic,Why remake a great classic 90s film?!

AST2-4db4ic,Not watching it. Book is the best
AST2-4db4ic,I cannot wait for this movie!!!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,I loved this movie! And im going to love this movie too!!
AST2-4db4ic,1:04-1:11 favourite moment ‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,I think Timoth√©e and Saoirse must have signed a blood pact or something. They come as a package deal for every movie they're in or else it triggers the apocalypse.
AST2-4db4ic,"Bale is my best Laurie, but can't wait to watch Timothee's versionüòù"
AST2-4db4ic,I can't wait!!!

My reason to watch this movie: just witty liner  ""well ,that's because I'm rich"""
AST2-4db4ic,"Saorise ronan,emma watson,and timothee chalamet are the best...and it will be worth it i wanna watch it so baddüòî‚ù§"
AST2-4db4ic,I clicked because of emma watsons
AST2-4db4ic,"Still heartbroken they replaced Emma Stone with Emma Watson. I know it was a schedule thing, but I would have loved to see Saoirse and Emma share the screen."
AST2-4db4ic,Be great or nothing. Well said
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Saoirse Saoirse anyone hearing huh I'm her hooting man she's my heart
AST2-4db4ic,I love little women I remember my mum reading it to me
AST2-4db4ic,I can‚Äôt even count the amount of times I‚Äôve watched this
AST2-4db4ic,What is the music playing during the scene where Jo is dancing?
AST2-4db4ic,"I love the Little Women movie from 1949. That's the best one yet with June Allyson who played Jo the somewhat tomboyish and boisterous sister, Elizabeth Taylor who played Amy the selfish pretty one who was interested in mostly herself but grew up to be a thoughtful and loving woman,  Beth the tenderhearted, sweet, selfless girl who dies much too young, and Janet Leigh who played the older very stable and sensible sister Meg. I never tire of watching it. It takes me back to a simpler time when family and friends were truly there for each other."
AST2-4db4ic,ü§°
AST2-4db4ic,"When I was 10 years old I read this book and I absolutely love it, now I‚Äôm almost 19 and I can‚Äôt wait to watch the movie  ü•∫"

*Joey: Oh, yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.*
*Ross: Um, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.*
*Joey: But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Ohhh! You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.*"
AST2-4db4ic,I can‚Äôt wait to see
AST2-4db4ic,"Sony and Warner going for quality films üëç
2019 is saved."
AST2-4db4ic,"This movie looks absolutely amazing! I love that it still has that classic feel while also seeming modern than previous adaptations. Also Saoirse, Timothee, Florence, Meryl and Eliza in a movie together? Please and thank you!"
AST2-4db4ic,She married to panda üêº from dude perfect
AST2-4db4ic,Julia Garner should really have been Amy.
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the song that starts at 1:35?

AST2-4db4ic,SONG AT 1:22???
AST2-4db4ic,‚Äúvaletudinarian‚Äù
AST2-4db4ic,I keep watching this over and over ICANT WAIT
AST2-4db4ic,Oh I really do hope they changed the ending of little women I couldn‚Äôt bare going through ‚Äòthat‚Äô again.

AST2-4db4ic,"Ronan, Pugh, and Watson.  Yes, they are talented but also all knockouts in their own ways"
AST2-4db4ic,We just want mcu Spider-Man.

AST2-4db4ic,I already love the original I know i will love this.
AST2-4db4ic,"These accents are all terrible, especially Emma‚Äôs"
AST2-4db4ic,I feel like I just watched the whole movie.. not much of a reason to go see it now.
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson üòç
AST2-4db4ic,"Just watched the 1995 version today for the first time. I was blown away by Winona Ryder's performance of Jo (she was nominated for an Oscar but lost to Jessica Lange for Blue Sky) She was so expressive even with no dialogue, and really embodied the character's passion, stubbornness, independence, and heartache. One of best female performances I've seen. Looking forward to Saoirse's portrayal."
AST2-4db4ic,"When everyone says ""im here because of emma.... etc"" and i was like *SIS IM HERE FOR MERYL*"
AST2-4db4ic,"Omg Louis Garrel is gonna be the Professor??! Well, yeah go get it Jo March!"
AST2-4db4ic,Amy is miscast. They should have hired a younger girl because that is one of the greatest things in Little Women. Laurie only saw Amy as a little sister until circumstances brought them together again. Like how Kirsten Dunst was cast then another actress was hired when she grew up.

AST2-4db4ic,Looks all right. Except for the accent. English Meg and Irish Jo indeed. Can‚Äôt they use Americans to play Americans? (And I‚Äôm not even American).
AST2-4db4ic,Am I the only who doesn't know any of these actors/actresses that u guys mentioned?

AST2-4db4ic,just another feminist movie... ugh
AST2-4db4ic,"Loved the trailer and of course, the book. But I have an observation. I noticed at the end of the official trailer, they list Timothee Chalamet and Chris Cooper ahead of Laura Dern and it's called Little WOMEN. Just saying."
AST2-4db4ic,"We don¬¥t need this. 
we have Winona¬¥s version.

AST2-4db4ic,i wanted to see this movie in theaters but now i can't cause it's a sony film :)
AST2-4db4ic,I've never related to someone's words before Jo.
AST2-4db4ic,"This movie will never be so perfect like the movie with Winona Ryder as Jo March. She was and still is the perfect actress for Jo. And it¬¥s the same with Trini Alvarado as Meg March, Claire Danes as Beth March, and Kirsten Dunst (later Samantha Mathis) as Amy March. There are so many movies about the March-family, from 1917 to 1994, and the movie from 1994 is the best (nominated for three Acadamy Awards). I like Emma Watson and Saoirse Ronan, but they can never be so perfect like the actresses from the adaption from 1994."
AST2-4db4ic,Florence Pugh is everywhere. What a year for her.

Me: Sir, you need to watch your own movie. üòÖ"
AST2-4db4ic,"This seems like a really unnecessary adaptation to me and I doubt it'll be better than the 1994 version. 


The casting is questionable. The actors are all great in their own right but some of them don't make sense as these characters. It looks like they're going to have Florence Pugh play Amy throughout the entire film but that doesn't really work for the character. She's the youngest at 12 when first introduced. Her relationship with Laurie is supposed to begin as a one sided crush on her part, with him not really noticing her at all until they run into each other in Europe and she's a grown woman. Timoth√©e Chalamet as Laurie doesn't really work either, at least not post time skip. He has a baby face, looks like he's 16 (which will work great for his role as the 15 year old Paul Atreides in Dune!). I also don't think Louis Garrel is old enough, or looks old enough, to play Friedrich Bhaer. He's supposed to be significantly older than Jo."
AST2-4db4ic,Big women or gtfo
AST2-4db4ic,screw sony
AST2-4db4ic,"Well, I'll give it a look see. I'm still a fan of the June Allison version and I know Ill get beaten down for this comment but really Meryl Streep AGAIN? Gosh, can't she stay home? She had to turn up in Mary Poppins'for some unknown reason but really is every remake gonna have  spot for her until she retires?"
AST2-4db4ic,Puke. The very American novel turned into a movie with four foreign actresses. Cast American!
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm sooo excited
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait to see it. Loved Elizabeth Taylor and Wonona Ryder in previous versions.

AST2-4db4ic,"The earth is in danger of ceasing its natural carbon recycling process thanks to just a handful of greedy humans. Are you enraged about this? Contact your local representatives and tell them to...

- Boycott food companies that accept and produce products from factory-style farms and agriculture (which is largely responsible for the clear cutting of the amazon forests and a huge percentage of greenhouse gas emissions.) 
- deny products into you community that employ slave labour, illegal logging, and environmental degradation of land and water to produce their products.
- Ban not only single use plastic bags. BAN single use plastic PACKAGING of products. Or tax them (the companies, not the people)
- stop accepting donations and lobbying for fossil fuel companies.  That's not democracy if you just keep ass kissing to billionaire company interests.
- subsidize local business and sustainable agriculture
- subsidize green energy production like Solar, wind and geothermal energy.
- promote healthier life styles. Ban car advertising in cities and promote public transit.
- put pressure on federal budgets to take away from military and nvest in green energy. (OR, if your country is too proud/dependent of its military, promote a reforestation/agriculture program within the military.)
- make investments into fossil fuel companies illegal and charge companies a fine for their continued ties with major oil and fossil fuel companies.
- promote reforestation programs.
- fine mines for every acre of forest and waterway they degrade through wreckless unsustainable strip-mining methods.
- fine fisheries that abandon their fishing nets in the ocean.

Join the movement, fight the symptom of climate pollution. 71% of the world's green house gas emissions comes from just 100 companies. We keep trying to reduce our carbon footprint individually, which is good and all, but the real problem comes from corporate interests. Remove that power from them, and real change will happen. Be part of the movement."

AST2-4db4ic,Jo was not like that at all.
AST2-4db4ic,Sony DO NOT destroy the MCU universe the success from Spider-Man is purely based on his involvement in tony starks legacy. Tom Holland is a treasure you can not take from us

AST2-4db4ic,"Sorry, Hollywood, but you're pushing an agenda for a cause that's ALREADY BEEN WON. Women are already heads of nations, have been astronauts, written great works, painted masterpieces, and are now CEOs of major corporations. What more do women want? I don't want to be a man, I don't need to have one, but they sure are nice to have around. So sick of this tired drumbeat for ""equality""."
AST2-4db4ic,Am very exited for saoirse ronan
AST2-4db4ic,I saw Emma Watson and i quickly clicked on the video.

AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse Ronan,Meryl Streep AND Emma Watson in ONE movie"
AST2-4db4ic,This movie is gonna KILL ME in the most beautiful way
AST2-4db4ic,"I absolutelt love all these women and their acting, but I don't think they fit the role of Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy at all. 
I wonder if the producers even read the book or if they just watched previous movies and based it off of that. Each girl is unique, and that uniqueness is supposed to, in part, be shown in their features. Looking at the old movies, you can clearly tell who's who, but I can't grasp that when looking at them."
AST2-4db4ic,"I swear actors, directors and costumes aren't like they used to be. This whole movie is off. The accents, acting, and dialogue are horrible. None of these women have that charming classic beauty so their roles don't look believable for the time. I'll take 1994 filmü§∑üèæ"
AST2-4db4ic,saoirse ronan i love you thank you for your acting at 2:06 and your entire existence

AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm so ready for this!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,So where does this take place because everyone has a different accent and ps. Joey spoiled it for me
AST2-4db4ic,this screams modern instead of something historically accurate
AST2-4db4ic,"In 2018 I took a new job as a SPED bus driver.  My route included going on Lowell Road, Concord, near the Newbury Field/Chamberlin Woods area.  Concord is an affluent community.  I noticed a big white tent building with heaters set up in someone's front yard.  I immediately thought that a structure that big and luxurious must be for a film crew.  Though I never saw any film crew, actors or actresses, I still believed the tent was there for their meal breaks.  I now know I was right, as I can see some of the locations in Concord, MA, which are in the film.  And to think that Saoirse ""I don't date"" Ronan was right there as I drove by.
üò¢"
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the song at the end of the trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,Looks great üëç
AST2-4db4ic,Img stupid movie
AST2-4db4ic,üíú
AST2-4db4ic,"Sure, I'll watch this"
AST2-4db4ic,Excited to watch
AST2-4db4ic,All the best actress together...
AST2-4db4ic,put it in the freezer
AST2-4db4ic,"Jo could not have possibly been cast better, she's my favourite character, followed by Laurie, because we share the same interests and are both inspiring writers, and im soooooooo excited to watch this in december üòçüòçüòç"
AST2-4db4ic,Im so in love with this!!! Hit me up when its showing or just hit me now cause i like this alot
AST2-4db4ic,I WANT TO WATCH THIS ALREADY!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Nakakaiyak! I wanna watch!
AST2-4db4ic,Yay - can‚Äôt wait! Trailer looks great - only Winona Ryder missing üòâ
AST2-4db4ic,"Would of been more intresting if Joe was black, adopted & gender non-conforming like in the play."
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan and Emma Watson! What masterpiece film!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl streepüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç always so beautiful üòóüòóüòóüòó
AST2-4db4ic,"*i see emma watson, i click*"
AST2-4db4ic,MOE SZYSLAK. That is all.
AST2-4db4ic,"From this trailer, Wynonna Ryder, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, Christian Bale, and Susan Sarandon have no worries what so ever! Claire Danes death scene alone looks to be better than this movie."
AST2-4db4ic,My first crush: Christian Bale as Laurie in the 1994 Little women! And that emotional scene with Jo really broke my heart...
AST2-4db4ic,"This feels like a ‚Äònew‚Äô (different) story to me, wouldn‚Äôt think of Little Women if it were not for the title. Maybe because of the modern dialogs?"
AST2-4db4ic,White wash
AST2-4db4ic,I need the score from this trailer like asap
AST2-4db4ic,"My favorite novel of all times, my favorite director of all times, and my celeb crush!! Lol"
AST2-4db4ic,I keep coming back to watch the trailer over and over again because I am so excited for this story with this cast. Christmas come soon!!!
AST2-4db4ic,I've watched this several times a day since it dropped because I can't freaking wait!!
AST2-4db4ic,Beth dies... thanks to Rachel
AST2-4db4ic,"*You aren‚Äôt married* 
That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm *rich*"
AST2-4db4ic,Christmas?! I wanna see it now!
AST2-4db4ic,"No, I'm not convinced."
AST2-4db4ic,They had to do still another remake of this movie so Hollywood can inject their poison of radical feminist nonsense into an otherwise enjoyable story.
AST2-4db4ic,Sorry but still my fav little women will forever be the one with winona rider and christian bale.
AST2-4db4ic,"1994 versi√≥n all the way! Sorry I don't like the cast, and even worst, the way they talk!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Daniel Jaek
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan my love!!! üòç
AST2-4db4ic,"If they ever do a remake of Titanic, that casting director BETTER put Saoirse and Timothee at the top of the list! There is NOTHING like their chemistry and real life friendship. Can you imagine that movie???"
AST2-4db4ic,"This is scary, I just did a play of this and finished the book and then this, God's timing my boys"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm going to have read this in high school
AST2-4db4ic,I LOVED THIS BOOK.
AST2-4db4ic,Hey there was an anime about this
AST2-4db4ic,Meh.  The 90's film looks like it was better.
AST2-4db4ic,Where are the lights in this movie. Why are they making movies so dark in Hollywood
AST2-4db4ic,"If the movie was called 'little men', let's face it, they couldn't even get 2 million views."
AST2-4db4ic,I can‚Äôt watch anything with Meryl high horse Streep. ü§Æ
AST2-4db4ic,All I see is hermione granger onstage
AST2-4db4ic,"I think it‚Äôs a mistake for producers to cast actors who have romantic chemistry to portray Jo and Laurie. It makes way for romanticizing what _should not_ be romanticized; Jo doesn‚Äôt have any romantic feelings for Laurie at all, while Laurie doesn‚Äôt take ‚ÄúNo‚Äù for an answer at first.
Yet in the comments below, you see people gushing on about Jo/Laurie like they don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it.

Seriously, though, you wouldn‚Äôt find it nice if your best friend, whom you have no feelings for, proposed to you, and after saying ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he still tries to convince you, even though nothing _can_ convince you because you simply don‚Äôt have feelings for him.
If you don‚Äôt have romantic feelings for someone, then you simply don‚Äôt. And it just makes the guy a jerk if they continue on after ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù"
AST2-4db4ic,My favorite is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn. ‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Ugh. I want to see this.
AST2-4db4ic,Subscribe to motion auto tv
AST2-4db4ic,"So odd they did not show Louis Garrel on the trailer, it‚Äôs big name too. Probably just to focus more on Jo‚Äôs and Laurie interaction vs Jo‚Äôs independence. But still, it‚Äôs a significant role."
AST2-4db4ic,"Joey: Hey Rachel!These little women, how little are they? 
Are they like scary little?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,Who else came here because they saw an anime of little women that came on a kids channel called smile little child
AST2-4db4ic,Joey is gonna cry his eyes out
AST2-4db4ic,So boring.
AST2-4db4ic,My all time fave movie little woman but original is best

AST2-4db4ic,omg i need this. a very eye opening for every women üë©
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse is so talented.
AST2-4db4ic,"I remember reading this book as a teenager, it was one of my favorite books üòä"
AST2-4db4ic,This has gotta be the 100th movie version!

AST2-4db4ic,"""BETH DIES""........Rachel already spoiled the movie for meüòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,OMG EVERYONE WAS SO WOKE AND QUIRKY IN THE 19TH CENTURY THANK YOU EMMA WATSON FOR SHOWING US WHAT IT WAS REALYL LIKE  BACK THEN
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl Streep? Another movie I don't get to see because she is in it. I hope she retires soon.
AST2-4db4ic,I am SO excited for this movie omggg
AST2-4db4ic,"ANOTHER remake when two others have been made. Getting sick of this,,"
AST2-4db4ic,Has Hollywood lost the ability to think of anything new? Remakes are all they have now.
AST2-4db4ic,Just interested because friends talked about it lmao
AST2-4db4ic,Yeeeeeet
AST2-4db4ic,I love Little Women. And this is another exciting lovely take. I hope! Can't wait.
AST2-4db4ic,I think Lurie and Jo not getting married was the biggest crime in historical fiction.
AST2-4db4ic,"Hahahahahahaha 





Hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahha fail"
AST2-4db4ic,my favourite book turned into a movie. üôåüôå
AST2-4db4ic,This looks great üëå..all the best greta gerwig

AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse,  undeniably the most Irish accent with the best fake American one.  üòÇ love it."
AST2-4db4ic,Nice tralirr
AST2-4db4ic,Why Emma Watson got only few dialogues in trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,I always ship Jo & Teddy..... :')
AST2-4db4ic,Crap movie
AST2-4db4ic,"I don't need to see it ...

AST2-4db4ic,I love this book.
AST2-4db4ic,I'm really looking forward to watch this film.I read the book and I really want to watch them live on screen.
AST2-4db4ic,Hard pass
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee Chalamet bringing his A game to this. (as always)
AST2-4db4ic,Everytime Emma wear goun she became most beautiful girl ever üòçüíì
AST2-4db4ic,It reminds me of one japanese anime
AST2-4db4ic,0:49 this is the reason why I want to become rich too
AST2-4db4ic,Wait Hermione is getting married ? What about Ron
AST2-4db4ic,I'm sorry but nothing can beat Christian bale and Winona Ryder
AST2-4db4ic,Watching this on loop and crying.
AST2-4db4ic,This trailer is one of those trailers that gives away the whole movie in s chronological order. No thanks but it looks okay :)
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma Watson, my first erection."
AST2-4db4ic,i've watched this trailer 4 times for Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet
AST2-4db4ic,YAS
AST2-4db4ic,"little women is not about love & marriage, it actually dwells on the importance of family & one‚Äôs dreams and aspirations, which this trailer unfortunately failed at portraying."
AST2-4db4ic,"I remember there's a Japanese Animated Series that was based from this novel and I usually watch it every Saturday and Sunday morning here in the Philippines together with Princess Sarah and Cedie, woah, I miss my innocent childhood! ü§îü§óü§óü§óü§ó"
AST2-4db4ic,It's a no....
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm sure its been said before but tim chalamet has the exact same vibe that Leonardo dicaprio did when he was young
AST2-4db4ic,"you mean...no..minorities!  How can this be.  You mean there werent blacks and latinos and h0m0sexuals infested in every part of the world back then?  How can this be.  


Nice to see  a film that bothers to cater to the most innovative people ever.   Youre welcome"
AST2-4db4ic,cant wait to watch this on big screen üòç
AST2-4db4ic,I cant wait! This movie will be a bop
AST2-4db4ic,I I'm here from Timoth√©e Chalamet account ‚ò∫‚ò∫
AST2-4db4ic,Wanna watch this movie because of Emma watson
AST2-4db4ic,"Almost didn‚Äôt recognize Emma Watson, which is weird because she doesn‚Äôt look all that different"
AST2-4db4ic,Didn't a remake come out last year? Why the next remake?
AST2-4db4ic,florence pugh conqueror the hollywood!
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúJust because my dreams are different than yours, doesn‚Äôt mean they are unimportant‚Äù 

I‚Äôm happy Meg was the one to say this. Joe‚Äôs dreams were different than Meg‚Äôs but it didn‚Äôt make her  dream of settling down and having a family any less important or less vital than Joe‚Äôs dream of being a writer."
AST2-4db4ic,"Two songs that are in the trailer that I found are:
Wasting Time -Katie Herzig
Finder - Cyrus Reynolds
Please comment below if you find more!"
AST2-4db4ic,This is going to be a gem...
AST2-4db4ic,Over the top girl power B.S.
AST2-4db4ic,"I read this book as a kid , I loved it!"
AST2-4db4ic,Seems to be the continuation of their love story from Lady birdüòÑ
AST2-4db4ic,"Me: How many heart broken Lauries can my heart take?  

Also me:  Let‚Äôs have one more.  I still have Anne and Gilbert to hold on to."
AST2-4db4ic,This is a very feminist cast rip
AST2-4db4ic,Boring....
AST2-4db4ic,she did got married well tho. she married Zero
AST2-4db4ic,I like my women the way I like my coffee. Ground up and in the fridge! OH!
AST2-4db4ic,"Jesus, how many remakes of this movie are Hollywood going to pump out?"
AST2-4db4ic,"I understand every story is subjected to different interpretations...but as a classic, the interpretations have long come to consensus. It‚Äôs a book advocating independence, self reliance and family values. I understand those values are rooted in feminist worldview. But feminist values are so much more intense than the values indicated in the original book. Thus, in my opinion, if anyone has such a different view, and she is capable, it‚Äôs best for her to develop her own stories instead ruining our classic. By saying ruining, I mean the future generation may view little women as a feminist book, no, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs written in a time feminism is not such a popular thing."
AST2-4db4ic,My headphones are a little broken so I couldn't hear much but the moment someone threw a pillow at someone else my head phones were alive and so loud? What the frick just happened?
AST2-4db4ic,Another little women. The one w. Wynona ryder is the best. üëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëè

AST2-4db4ic,florence yummy pugh
AST2-4db4ic,its great that there are ways to watch movies early if you cant wait for them to come out in theaters
AST2-4db4ic,i think i will go to 123dailymoviespro and watch it right now
AST2-4db4ic,Wow i loved this book so much I am really excited to see this movie it looks really faithful to the book
AST2-4db4ic,i cant wait for the movie to come out in theaters
AST2-4db4ic,"It's kind of funny that Greta Gerwig, someone who doesn't have sisters or daughters, thought she needed to update Alcott's dialogue based on her own sisters. I think Robin Swicord, who wrote the 1994 screenplay (and is also a woman!), understood that Alcott's writing was famous for a reason and it was important to maintain her voice. It's weird to make a feminist story and erase the voice of the woman who created it."
AST2-4db4ic,I wish i had sisters
AST2-4db4ic,Little Wamen
AST2-4db4ic,"'just because my dreams are different than yours, it doesn't mean they're not important' üëèüèº"
AST2-4db4ic,Is this movie playing everywhere & when is it coming out?
AST2-4db4ic,One thing is clear. They didn't respect the source material.
AST2-4db4ic,The actresses are too old. All the March girls are supposed to be in their early teens.
AST2-4db4ic,I never really liked this book :/// and they are making a movie. Wow
AST2-4db4ic,Little Feminists: The Movie.
AST2-4db4ic,How close is this to the book?
AST2-4db4ic,Hollywood ran out of ideas
AST2-4db4ic,"Merly Streep is beautiful actor!"""
AST2-4db4ic,I don‚Äôt know if this can top the original with Winona and Christian Bale.
AST2-4db4ic,THE FEMINISTS ARE TAKING OVER!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,That‚Äôs gonna suck
AST2-4db4ic,Only Emma and Saoirse on the trailer...other 2 girls barely appear lol.

AST2-4db4ic,Wait. I swear I've seen a trailer for a remake of Little Women as a modern version though?? Did that ever happen?
AST2-4db4ic,I would rather lesser name actors. It's seemingly like factory made. I'm just not feeling it.
AST2-4db4ic,‚ÄúI want to be great or nothing‚Äù oml
AST2-4db4ic,"""More than just beauty"" 
Shows Emma Watson
Am I sensing a Disney reference?!"
AST2-4db4ic,I'm just glad they chose the perfect actors for the film :')
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse will win an Oscar for this
AST2-4db4ic,Nope.
AST2-4db4ic,No thanks.... I enjoyed the previous version
AST2-4db4ic,The first look is just awful...  Jo appears to be such a feminist figure
AST2-4db4ic,Did you see Emma Watson?
AST2-4db4ic,1:08 that scene is so cute
AST2-4db4ic,This won‚Äôt beat Winona but I will still watch it since it‚Äôs my favorite book !
AST2-4db4ic,"""just because my dreams are different than yours doesn't mean they're unimportant"" :')

WILL DEFINITELY WATCH THIS !!!"
AST2-4db4ic,JOE DIES IN THE END.....Your wlecome
AST2-4db4ic,"*shriieeeeeeeek* 
OMG THIS IS LITERALLY EVERYTHING IVE BELIEVED AND WANTED TO STAND FOR SINCE I NEW BOUT HOW WOMEN WERE TREATED!



female
Fe is iron in the periodic table and male stands 4 man therefore...
girls are Iron man!"
AST2-4db4ic,Only Emma and Saoirse on the trailer...other 2 girls barely appear lol.
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone else bothered by the costumes historical inaccuracies? Just me? Okay. I'll let myself out then.
AST2-4db4ic,"That looks awful, they already made a beautiful movie of this novel and it should be left alone. Don‚Äôt need to remake a classic."
AST2-4db4ic,"No thanks. Winona forever. And Susan Sarandon, Kirsten Dunst, Trini Alvarado, Clare Danes, and Christian Bale. Don't mess."
AST2-4db4ic,Emma watson and Saoirse Ronan in one movie. Been waiting for this!
AST2-4db4ic,"so, what? every 15 years this thing has to be remade? is that the deal? zzzzzz"
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚Äôve read the book thousands of times, hope the movie doesn‚Äôt disappoint me"
AST2-4db4ic,"I want to cry. I read the book when I was in elementary school, and it's one of my most favorite books of all time. This brings back so many memories. I am so happy that this movie is coming out."
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WATSON?????? NO WAY
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚Äôll always prefer the 1994 version, but this doesn‚Äôt look terrible. It‚Äôs a little shiny for the period and I have some thoughts about the casting and acting, but it is just a trailer so I‚Äôm willing to watch the movie before forming a concrete opinion."
AST2-4db4ic,I remember reading this book when I was just a Kid... Will definitely watch this. Very Nostalgic
AST2-4db4ic,I haven't read the book but I recognised 'coz of Rachel ya know
AST2-4db4ic,This reminds me of Anne with an E!! I‚Äôm so excited!!
AST2-4db4ic,It‚Äôs simple I see Emma Watson I click
AST2-4db4ic,If we know anything about reboot woman it that this will probably be feminist movie.
AST2-4db4ic,FLORENCE PUGH.... she‚Äôs soooooo perfect
AST2-4db4ic,"""Joey, you wanna put the book in the freezer?"""
AST2-4db4ic,Idk why i get anne with an e vibes
AST2-4db4ic,"Ugh, I'm so sick of screenwriters who feel like they need to insert ""woke"" 20th-century speeches into the mouths of classic characters. Why can't they just respect the values of the time & present them accurately, as originally written??"
AST2-4db4ic,I can already tell this is gonna be a mess.üòì
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôve watched this trailer probably 5 or 6 times over the past few days and I‚Äôve teared up / cried every time. It looks beautiful
AST2-4db4ic,Dang!!! Almost forgot to watch this trailer today!üòÅ‚ù§
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson üíúüíúüòòüòò

AST2-4db4ic,Jo dies
AST2-4db4ic,i‚Äôm so excited y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even know omg
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Chamalamet againüíï
AST2-4db4ic,"Downton Abbey movie September 20th, and now this... it's going to be a great fall/winter for movies!!! So glad Saoirse is in this, she's great. Amazing cast! I can't wait!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"You have to watch :
1. Little Women by George Cukor 1933 (starring Katharine Hepburn as Jo)
2. Little Women by Mervyn LeRoy 1949 (Elizabeth Taylor as Amy, Janet Leigh as Meg, Peter Lawford as Laurie, Mary Astor as Marmie, June Allyson as Jo, Margareth O'Brien as Beth, etc)
3. Little Women by Gillian Amstrong 1994 (Winona Ryder as Jo, Kristen Dust as Amy, Claire Danes as Beth, Christian Bale as Laurie, and Susan Saradon as Marmie)

Then you are ready to watch this version"
AST2-4db4ic,I haven't read the book but I recognised 'coz of Rachel ya know
AST2-4db4ic,I wanna watch it already.
AST2-4db4ic,"I spoke to one of the producers and the reason for the bad accents is simple:

Will Smith wasn't available."
AST2-4db4ic,"Liberals hand out ""Caucasian American"" roles like they're Halloween candy.  Black, different gender, different accent -- it doesn't matter who plays ""whitey's"" role.  There's clearly a bias at play here."
AST2-4db4ic,"_well this looks awfully crappy, I do say sir_"
AST2-4db4ic,lol @ the bad accents that don't match!  This looks worse than female Ghostbusters.
AST2-4db4ic,I have watched this trailer everyday since its release.I cant wait.
AST2-4db4ic,oo hermionie got a day job we stan
AST2-4db4ic,Can we please have an ending where Jo doesn't get married and pursues her passion for writing :(
AST2-4db4ic,"Meryl Streep, Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothee Chalamet... I already know this will be a great movie"
AST2-4db4ic,OMG STOP IT YOURE GONNA MAKE ME CRY üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,"this cast,,, *chefs kiss*"
AST2-4db4ic,How hard is it to make historically accurate costumes for a movie I- üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,this is beautiful
AST2-4db4ic,"I think Florence Pugh and Emma Watson should have switched roles. In the novel, Amy is portrayed as the youngest, liveliest and very attractive (much like Meg, which made them a close pair in contrast to the Jo and Beth pairing) but Florence Pugh doesn't look like Amy at all, while Emma Watson still looks like a high school girl rather than the oldest of the four sisters.
It would have been more convincing if Emma played Amy,
or cast someone like Elle Fanning for that role while let Emma play Meg
Too bad"
AST2-4db4ic,someone needs to do a 'Little Men' adaptation
AST2-4db4ic,This will be a box office smash üòÇ not

AST2-4db4ic,Greg Heffley approves
AST2-4db4ic,"How I imagine the Set...

Meryl Streep: How are we?
Laura Dern: How are WE???"
AST2-4db4ic,"So the girl playing Jo has that American accent, but that‚Äôs little sentence Emma Watson was saying had kind of a British accent. It‚Äôll annoy me if she‚Äôs the only only with a brutish accent."
AST2-4db4ic,I am dying I love the book so much and now we have a movie eeeeee
AST2-4db4ic,"Sorry, but I can't watch any movies featuring Meryl Streep."
AST2-4db4ic,I'd be enthralled to see Emma back on screen üíò
AST2-4db4ic,"The title is 'little women', but all the actors are above 20. Why is age-appropriate casting such a problem? I didn't love the Winona Ryder one but at least that director understood English."
AST2-4db4ic,joey tribbiani is gonna LOVE this
AST2-4db4ic,Amy is my fave character I can't wait to see her and Laurie's love bloom in live action!!üòçüòç

Women are by no means only meant to love but don't dismiss your ability to love so easily. The nurturing spirit of women is what guides this world towards grace.

AST2-4db4ic,Pretty please feature a lil hint of music from the musical ( maybe even just the instrumentals for days of plenty and more than I am)
AST2-4db4ic,"Oof, hope this has a reasonable Amy.
If it doesn‚Äôt, I might as well consider this as a miss.
(If you want to know why just ask me why)"
AST2-4db4ic,I have a knot in my throat after watching this trailer. For some reason it made me want to cry. I can‚Äôt wait for the movie to come out. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs gonna be my new favorite
AST2-4db4ic,Joey Tribiani is quaking
AST2-4db4ic,"Well, it looks like it stayed true to the original, but Amy needs to be a bit younger. Lorrie looks just like the one from the old cartoon, and Maryl Streep plays their aunt fantastically. It doesn't look like Feminists are going to be pushing any Anti-men stuff in this, but it's too soon to tell. All in all, I'd watch it based on this trailer alone."
AST2-4db4ic,"was literally just counting the seconds till Meryl Streep poped up, if she wasn't in this that would be so off brand for her"
AST2-4db4ic,Rach if I keep reading is Beth gonna die?!
AST2-4db4ic,"Can't match the 1990's version with Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Clare Danes, and Kirsten Dunst."
AST2-4db4ic,Oh joy! Another little women movie. Just what we need the femmanazi edition of little skanks.
AST2-4db4ic,No closed captions? Come on Sony!
AST2-4db4ic,The first one is great what‚Äôs the point of making a new one
AST2-4db4ic,1:34 why timothy has my heart
AST2-4db4ic,"PEDOPHILE HOLLYJEW at it again.

Don't be brainwashed by films like these. These movies push feminism. That you are a woman and can do it all on your own with no man or children. This is a fantastic lie. You will end up old and very alone working till you're 70 if you don't die sooner or get lose your job, competing with younger, new, less expensive generations. Renting a bedroom in a share appartment with 6 other people with 1 bathroom and a cat. The smell I've smelled with a cat lady who lives in a bedroom... Look at the old lonely women who put their career first and travelled the world alone. 

I know it was originally a book and a remake of an old classic. You must awaken to the true agenda now. The end goal is your GENOCIDE."
AST2-4db4ic,If I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôm only watching for timothee chalametüíÄüíÄ
AST2-4db4ic,timothee
AST2-4db4ic,"Hope they actually focus on Amy‚Äôs character development and maturity. All the other remakes always forgets that and people get pissed at her ending up with Laurie. If you read the book, you‚Äôd relate."
AST2-4db4ic,"Classic....I don't even remember the story now, but I still would like to watch the movie..."
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Emma in one movie is ‚ù§
AST2-4db4ic,They've literally remade this story so many times I can't even keep them straight anymore
AST2-4db4ic,How come they‚Äôre all sisters and one of them has British accent? üòÜ
AST2-4db4ic,Esperando ancioso.üíï
AST2-4db4ic,"Now, Alcott was very, very precise about her characters' physical appearance. And they fail to cast four out of four sisters. With that actor as Laurie, they miscast all of the young ones.
As if there weren't enough adaptations already."
AST2-4db4ic,"Spoiler, Beth dies."
AST2-4db4ic,"I mean, I love all the actors but like I love the 1994 little women"
AST2-4db4ic,"was literally just counting the seconds till Meryl Streep poped up, if she wasn't in this that would be so off brand for her"
AST2-4db4ic,"Uh since when did 
they say ""spicy"" in the Victorian Jane Austin era? There's no way that's in the book! Please tell me that was a terrible studio,  catering to young girls who have been subjected to the teaching method disease known as Common Core and never were told to read this classic book, decison? Not Greta Gerwig deciding to take some gross liberties with classic dialogue! I'm sorry but that really takes me out of the story. I would take my neice to see this but I want her to hear the original text not modern slang that takes me out of the period! I really hope this will not be the norm now, the dumbing down of classic literature with modern talk and dare I say references! I mean do some thirty something executives think its cute to do this to period pieces now? Or that it will earn them some extra bucks these days if the kids hear relatable slang? I mean you had a great young cast of talents for the Little Women I know from the 90s. Ryder, Dunst, Mathis, Alvarado, Sarandon, Danes. That was the ulimate Little Women cast and this comes close. So please like that cast, let them sya the actual lines from the book! Don't have the great Saoirse Ronan say things to her first love  like 'totes' when he asks her ""So this publisher I gave your manuscript to said you really know your way around a quill Bae! Kill Me, if that's the case, really!!! I mean its bad enough Stranger Things takes me out of the show now by the kids saying ""super"" every other sentence! I was a kid in the 80s, know one said 'super' then!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Where is kitty ,Minnie ,and mis, Kirk???   Where is the Kirk family?????"
AST2-4db4ic,"This is Will, Simon, Jay and Neil."
AST2-4db4ic,Let's she how modern Hollywood ruins another great classic ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Here only for Emma
AST2-4db4ic,This is my 10th time watching the trailer and I get chills every time! I‚Äôm so excited my favorite director has done one of my favorite classic books!
AST2-4db4ic,The music in trailer is definitely not as rich and lovely as 1994's theme. I feel like they cast the film using a buzzfeed poll.
AST2-4db4ic,"""I want to be great or nothing"""
AST2-4db4ic,Amy March is younger than Beth March... they fudged up the casting
AST2-4db4ic,Well I have till Christmas to finish a book
AST2-4db4ic,The blah music ruined it for me.
AST2-4db4ic,Music 2:08   ??
AST2-4db4ic,"Perhaps it is just the casting, but it seems here that they have Beth the youngest, when it is in fact Amy."
AST2-4db4ic,Music 2:08  ??
AST2-4db4ic,Why is it that there is always at least 2 versions of the same thing that come out within a couple years of each other? PBS literally just released a production of Little Woman last year... How am I supposed to pick ü§¶
AST2-4db4ic,I loved the book
AST2-4db4ic,I want this cast for a Pride and prejudice movie üò©üôèüèª
AST2-4db4ic,I'm in love with the music!!
AST2-4db4ic,The original little women will always be better
AST2-4db4ic,Humming at 0:52 üòä
AST2-4db4ic,My most loved book ever... thanks so much for this...ü•∞üòçü§©
AST2-4db4ic,"I swear if Jo doesn't get her professor r Bhaer, I'll be upset"
AST2-4db4ic,Timoth√©e ‚ô•Ô∏èüò©
AST2-4db4ic,Joey : put it in the freezer!
AST2-4db4ic,The music in trailer is definitely not as rich and lovely as 1994's theme. I feel like they cast the film using a buzzfeed poll.
AST2-4db4ic,I'm surprised they didn't call it Little Non-Binaries
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone find Emma Watson‚Äôs American accent a bit... off?
AST2-4db4ic,"This seems like an exciting take on  the book in that they seem to weave some of the author's own thoughts on the story, etc. 
In fact, BOOK AND 1994 FILM  SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ms.Alcott would have preferred Jo to never marry, buuuut her editor thought otherwise."
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WATSON IS TERRIBLE
AST2-4db4ic,Nahhhhg
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Timothee back together again! With the same director too! Flawless chemistry.
AST2-4db4ic,"All I can say is I love Timothee Chalamet, that's all I will say. Bye."
AST2-4db4ic,Ew
AST2-4db4ic,2:00 üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ

AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse is a treasure.
AST2-4db4ic,Just can‚Äôt wait ü•∫üíñ‚ö°Ô∏èüò≠
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson has the WORST american accent!!
AST2-4db4ic,Women and gays will love this story!
AST2-4db4ic,I already love this so much. The story is totally my type and the cast is great.
AST2-4db4ic,not interesting! who cares about them.
AST2-4db4ic,"Since I was borne there has been two Little Women movies, two Karate Kid movies, two A Star is Born moves, two Top Gun movies, two Footloose movies, two Point Breaks, and so on. I am looking forward to seeing this movie, but enough already! There are so many stories that haven't been told that are far more interesting than Little Women! At this point it is just about re-branding a successful product and that sours it for me. Take a chance and make something original! Tell a story that we haven't heard! How about telling a story about the nonwhite women of that era and what they went through! No more Little White Women!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"""beth dies"" - Rachel Green"
AST2-4db4ic,How many times are they going to make this over?
AST2-4db4ic,"Can someone who knows the story tell me who are the main characters of this. I mean, obviously Ronan is the main lead. That much is obvious. But the trailer makes it seem like Chalamet's character is second most prominent. Watson gets second billing but she only has a couple of lines in the trailer and Streep and Dern seem like afterthoughts. I know its just a first trailer but I'm curious who are the main characters of prominence in this. It would be odd to get actors like Dern and Streep and have them in really small roles."
AST2-4db4ic,What a beautiful track accompanying the trailer <3
AST2-4db4ic,"Yess!!!!
I've been waiting for this.
I do hope Josephine and Laurie get married in the end, unlike in the books. And that Jo doesn't ""cork up her inkstand"". They'd make a perfect match."
AST2-4db4ic,I saw the 1949 and 1994 film versions! But i will see this one for Saiorse Emma Meryl and Laura
AST2-4db4ic,"You know... there was a time when whites and all their nonsense claimed Africans, Middle Easterners, and Asians as oppressor peoples of their respective women... while they were ""progressive"" or ""liberal"" in their treatment of their women... Who would believe such lies?"
AST2-4db4ic,"""I'm so sick of people saying that love is just all of the woman saved for. Im so sick of it""."
AST2-4db4ic,I am not satisfied because Emma Watson rolled has few ü§Æüò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑
AST2-4db4ic,Great. Another movie about white women. Just what we needed. üôÑ
AST2-4db4ic,I've honestly never cared about Little Women.....until this trailer.  NOW I'm interested!!! üòç
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm team Winona/Bale üòÄ but I believe this generation needs to see this movie.
AST2-4db4ic,"This is a story I re-read literally twice a month during elementary and middle school, little women little men was cute too it shaped me alot even after I grew out of it. Im excited to see how much they preserve of the original spirit ‚ô•Ô∏è"
AST2-4db4ic,Man i remember reading this book in gr.6 for book reports x)

AST2-4db4ic,Joe looks to old for teddy
AST2-4db4ic,Whoever made this trailer deserves an Oscar
AST2-4db4ic,Everyone‚Äôs talking about Timmy‚Äôs hair and all whole  I‚Äôm just sitting here mesmerized by beauty of Saoirse Ronan
AST2-4db4ic,"- *But you're not married.....*
- *that's because I'm rich*

^ reason why I want to be rich -/"
AST2-4db4ic,"Ok thank you, thank you for making a movie i didnt even know i needed."
AST2-4db4ic,there are so many lady bird characters in this and i fucking love it !!
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WATSON YAAAAASSSS
AST2-4db4ic,"Omg, I now have to tell my English teacher that her favourite book is now becoming a movie! She‚Äôll either burn all cinemas or book then all out! üòÇüòÖ"
AST2-4db4ic,Excited!!
AST2-4db4ic,I hated the book little women because it was boring
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson is here ?! I NEED TO SEE THIS!ü§£
AST2-4db4ic,I love Emmaüòç
AST2-4db4ic,Amy is supposed to be the youngest but they made Beth the young one.
AST2-4db4ic,It's not sticking to the core theme of the book üòî I'm such a book worm and I'm so disappointed üò≠ But I'll still watch it üòè
AST2-4db4ic,Who here only for Emma Watson
AST2-4db4ic,"saoirse, timoth√©e, AND florence pugh all in the same movie? i think YES"
AST2-4db4ic,What is the song playing throughout the trailer/at the end?
AST2-4db4ic,"Ok... FIRST OF ALL, if a movie is to make changes they must be changes that make sense or improve upon the source material. I see neither of this. The hair colors aren't even right, the personalities aren't right, the only thing they DID get was Laurie's unrequited love for Jo. And, judging by the trailer, they're going to try to weasel in too many storylines and it'll end up a jumbly mess. That was a problem I had with the book. 
I'm not trying to say the book was perfect. Actually it's one of my least favorites. But that doesn't mean it should be degraded to a simple Hollywood flick.

Edit: Also, as an afterthought, why are the ages mixed up?"
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm reading that book right now, and this looks great!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Can we all talk about Florence Pugh though? I bet she's going to be the standout of the film, and I don't doubt it after watching Midsommar."
AST2-4db4ic,"SPoiler!!!!!




I know Beth dies becuz Rachel ruins the book for Joey in the episode where they swap books and Joey accidentally ruins it for Rachel. Can anyone else relate???!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Look, I'm not a fan of Emma Watson but I think when she says the line 'A play by Miss Jo March', her character puts on a fake cockney accent, I don't think that's her American accent. It's just confusing because we all know Emma has an English accent."
AST2-4db4ic,But how little are these women...? Like scary little?
AST2-4db4ic,Cantankerous change resistant middle age man here who has never been interested in any version of Little Women my entire life. Ronan and Chalamet are in it? I will be there opening night.
AST2-4db4ic,I'M SO HAPPY I'M SO EXCITED
AST2-4db4ic,"Another version of little women? omg lets see something never been done before,

AST2-4db4ic,Greta GerwigüòçüòçüòçüòçOnly you can make magic happens.
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse is so beautiful
AST2-4db4ic,My heart and  brain and body have just melted ....
AST2-4db4ic,best cast thus far.
AST2-4db4ic,TIMOTHEE CHALAMET OMG
AST2-4db4ic,I smell an oscar....
AST2-4db4ic,It sorta looks like it was filmed on film
AST2-4db4ic,"Omg 2 amazing things put together; Emma Watson and little women.



HOLY MOLY SOMEONE PINCH ME AM I DREAMING?!?"
AST2-4db4ic,Lol in the first 20 secs a woman assaults a man hilariousüòÇüòÇüòÇüëèüëè
AST2-4db4ic,"If we watch this, Beth's going to die"
AST2-4db4ic,Jo will always be the best character for me. She's a woman ahead of her times.
AST2-4db4ic,*sees Timoth√©e Chalamet and instantly likes* ü§©ü§§ü§©ü§§
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone else think Meryl Streep looks like the fairy godmother from shrek 2?

AST2-4db4ic,Love vintage stuff

AST2-4db4ic,Is this the third movie with both Saoirse and Timothee in it?? üòÇüòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,Jo dies
AST2-4db4ic,"Ahhh so so so excited about this one!! The characters, the time of the story, the chemistry between saoirse and timothee, everything is just too perfect‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è My heart is so full rn after watching this I cant keep calm loll !!!üò≠üò≠"
AST2-4db4ic,It looks amazing!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Joey..you better put this inside your fridge!!...
AST2-4db4ic,Why don't they have English accents?
AST2-4db4ic,"Oh look yet another ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a woman, hear me roar‚Äù movie. I bet a million dollars that if they remade little woman with men and made comments about how we can do what women do we‚Äôd have woman stomping the ground at Sony studios and picketing about sexism..... what an unfair world we live in"
AST2-4db4ic,"oh my heart! this is the true example of a classic English Tea! i love it, i love it, i love it!"
AST2-4db4ic,i want more emma
AST2-4db4ic,"I would love to see emma watson, lily james, elle fanning and naomi scott in here.."
AST2-4db4ic,Why?
AST2-4db4ic,Is it me or is something up with the lighting?  Like it is from 20 years ago.
AST2-4db4ic,"How about, no."
AST2-4db4ic,"Watching this trailer has made me realise how attached I am to the way I thought the characters should look like xD I love Emma Watson but I'm like ""SHE DOESNT LOOK RIGHT. WHY'S HER HAIR DARKER THAN JO'S? but I didn't have this issue with the 1994 version, even though they also looked different."
AST2-4db4ic,Wait why are people complaining about emma? I feel like she did an American accent fine
AST2-4db4ic,Pride and prejudice??
AST2-4db4ic,OMG IS THAT HERMIONIE
AST2-4db4ic,"While most of these actors are great...the casting of the March family feels strange to me. These women look so *completely* different from one another and are supposed to be sisters? They are also quite old to convincingly play teenagers. I really wish the March sisters had gone to younger actors. Also, Florence plays Amy...but naturally speaks with a husky, nasally voice although she‚Äôs supposed to be sweet and romantic. Odd choice. Emma Watson...sorry but she can‚Äôt do an American accent!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Idk about this... the original is untouchable
AST2-4db4ic,this cast... *chef‚Äôs kiss*
AST2-4db4ic,That title is not inclusive.
AST2-4db4ic,"The society, Harry Potter, lovely bones"
AST2-4db4ic,am I the only one who thinks they basically gave away the entire movie in the trailer? like all the plot twist I loved in the '94 adaptation are like spelled out in the trailer. love it and can't wait to watch it but still
AST2-4db4ic,i started to read the book little women bc of this remake
AST2-4db4ic,"I was just saying the other day ""When are we going to have another adaptation of Little Women""? My life is now complete although waiting until Christmas will be just so painful... Now, if they would only put out another adaptation of Anne of Green Gables... then the preteen girl who resides inside me can once again be free to run along the wind swept dunes with my bosom friends."
AST2-4db4ic,Oscar is waving lol
AST2-4db4ic,"Between this and Frozen 2, great movies to celebrate sororal love in 2019."
AST2-4db4ic,NOPE!!! WON'T BE SEEING THIS FEMROID VERSION.
AST2-4db4ic,This looks brilliant!!
AST2-4db4ic,Definitely will see this.¬† Note - Beth should NOT have red hair.
AST2-4db4ic,what is up with emma watsons accent though
AST2-4db4ic,Omg the cast is amazing ü§©ü§©
AST2-4db4ic,"I can't understand how people think Timoth√©e is attractive, I just can't  ‚ïÆ(‚ïπ‚ñΩ‚ïπ)‚ï≠"
AST2-4db4ic,Um who was in charge of costume design & hair in this film?! Yikes - but I‚Äôm not surprised Hollywood has rarely ever been historically accurate in these areas
AST2-4db4ic,"I've loved the story of Little Women since I was a kid, but if this adaptation is nothing more than feminist propaganda, I'm gonna cry. They'd better not mess this up."
AST2-4db4ic,AHHHHHHHHHH I‚ÄôM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson needs an accent coach üòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,"Everyone is talking about the 1994 version has no one seen the 1949 version with June Allison, Margaret O'Brien, and Elizabeth Taylor? That's the version I grew up watching and I'm a 90s baby."
AST2-4db4ic,someone before the 1million views?
AST2-4db4ic,That me too bulshit really  destroyed  art. This movie had everything  to be motivational  story but its soo busy pushing Agenda  it lost other major parts. Dear women your work will make you shine you don't have use agenda to sell a movie
AST2-4db4ic,"If Saiorse and Timothee keep this up, they will have nominations after nominations, and they are still so young! Can‚Äôt wait to see them grow _even_ more!"
AST2-4db4ic,Emma's accent is making me sad
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse is just stunning in this üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,glad they changed the thumbnail
AST2-4db4ic,I fondly remember the Winona Ryder version from the 90s. It didn't have any of the snippy man-hatred of this version.
AST2-4db4ic,0:48 aunt joesephine barry is that you?
AST2-4db4ic,"I speak for all of us when I say that this trailer looks...""Astonishing"""
AST2-4db4ic,I am I the only one who read the book growing up
AST2-4db4ic,tell me how I just finished a musical for theater on little women :|
AST2-4db4ic,Booo! Booo!
AST2-4db4ic,"Oh my, can't wait for this!"
AST2-4db4ic,this is SO FRICKIN CUTE AND AMAZING OMGGGGGGGGGG
AST2-4db4ic,holy im so excited to watch this
AST2-4db4ic,Song?
AST2-4db4ic,"1:13 - I'm sorry, but why does Amy sound like an 80-year-old smoker and look like a 35 year old woman? She's supposed to be the youngest!"
AST2-4db4ic,"This film looks brilliant !   ""Little Women"" has always been my most cherished novel ~ I've always enjoyed the movie versions as well.  This one looks sumptuous.   Can't wait!  :)"
AST2-4db4ic,Omg chills!!!!! I can‚Äôt wait for this movie
AST2-4db4ic,Looks Charming.
AST2-4db4ic,"Oh boy just what we need another ""Little Women"" film adaptation. You know what would be better, a TV series. With a film a lot is cut from the story especially key moments and character growths. Jo always has the most focus what the other three sisters and Laurie are ignored. They are all important."
AST2-4db4ic,My mom bought me this book for Christmas one year. I absolutely lovedüòç the book
AST2-4db4ic,Got here from Emma‚Äôs Instagram post! ‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,0:48 aunt joesephine barry is that you?
AST2-4db4ic,"Hello, I am obsessed with Timoth√©e Chalamet! Nice to meet you."
AST2-4db4ic,"Just sent this link to my grandma..
She's going to lose her mind!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Nope, thank you. the 90's version is perfect and I already feel this one will be overloaded with politics. The 94 version was delicate in this respect. Plus, sorry but Bale's Laurie and Winona's Jo was perfect duo. I hated that they didn't end up together, so I don't want to watch this ending again."
AST2-4db4ic,"Oh, great. Now I get to watch Beth die in love action. Wooooo."
AST2-4db4ic,Yet another remake of this!!??
AST2-4db4ic,This is one expensive cast
AST2-4db4ic,All the best actors im freaking out
AST2-4db4ic,"Feminist Agenda once again...no just kidding, this is awesome."
AST2-4db4ic,Omg omg omg SR is in it !!!! . Im a huge fan of her .
AST2-4db4ic,"I. AM. HERE. FOR. ALL. OF. THIS!!!! Now if another season of ""Anne with an E"" could please come out around the same time, my winter will be perfect!"
AST2-4db4ic,I thought Emma Watson was Jo for a second but I was shook when I realized she's Meg!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Meh. Looks like it‚Äôs gonna be trash.
AST2-4db4ic,I thought I had read this book or done a play on it before but I don‚Äôt remember anything about it üòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,Bad.Very bad. These are not the little women.These are the big women
AST2-4db4ic,"Timoth√©e Chalamet, Emma Watson and also Meryl Streep, this movie is gonna be marvelous"
AST2-4db4ic,"*""Well that's because I'm rich""*
 I can already tell I will love this movie"
AST2-4db4ic,When you actually read the book so you know what happens to Beth in the end
AST2-4db4ic,BUT DOES IT TAKE PLACE IN THE KITCHEN
AST2-4db4ic,okay but timoth√©e chalamet and emma watson is the same movie
AST2-4db4ic,Is it weird that i keep watching the trailer over and over !!? !  I like it so much alreadyüò≠
AST2-4db4ic,"Hopefully, this version adheres closer to the novel than the Winona Ryder/Susan Sarandon one did.   That one got a little too overtly political.  This one is looking lovely from the trailer though!"
AST2-4db4ic,If this gets oscar nominated for best picture I want Winona ryder to be the presenter of this as one of the best picture nominees.
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone know the name of the song/tune starting at 1:22
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson speaking with a mouthful of marbles would've sounded better than this.
AST2-4db4ic,The BBC version from two years ago is my joint favourite with the 90s version. This will take a lot to sneak up past both of those but I'm curious.
AST2-4db4ic,Jeez how much longer until yalls empowerment meter is filled up?
AST2-4db4ic,Little Women was the first 'big' book I read when I was eight and fell in love with it. I cry every single time I see or  read beth die. I can quote the novel as well as the 1994 movie
AST2-4db4ic,"Even though I'm not a big fan of Emma Watson, I'm not getting this outcry over her American accent.  They barely even show her in this trailer.  There's literally only a few seconds of her speaking.  It looks like Saoirse Ronan gets the lion's share of focus here.  You'd think she was the lead."
AST2-4db4ic,Looks like Rachel and Joey will be happy
AST2-4db4ic,"Already been done, and quite well, I might add! This seems to be adding a stupid feministic quality that shouldn't be there."
AST2-4db4ic,The song at the end is Finder by Cyrus Reynolds in case any of you were wondering.
AST2-4db4ic,Nope
AST2-4db4ic,"1:59 - 2:00 
Perfection‚ù§"
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma, in victorian outfit, corssette... nuff said‚ù§"
AST2-4db4ic,"You mean i have to go through the pain of Jo & Laurie not ending up together all over again ?? 
Can they please mess with the ending lmao"
AST2-4db4ic,More terrible female movies that nobody wants to watch. Just why
AST2-4db4ic,"I have no doubt that this movie will do well. saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence pugh, timothee chalamet, Meryl, Laura dern......and greta gerwig as the director???? yeah this'll do just fine lol"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm full blown sobbing at this trailer I can‚Äôt wait for the movie to completely incapacitate me
AST2-4db4ic,Will it come in Hindi
AST2-4db4ic,"Way too Eurocentric, throw it away!"
AST2-4db4ic,Man i love saoirse. She's gonna be the next meryl streep
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúI want to be great, or nothing!‚Äù"
AST2-4db4ic,"I really want them to release the song from the second half of the trailer, I love it"
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm confused by all these accents. Are they supposed to be American or English? Lmao. Great trailer, nonetheless."
AST2-4db4ic,Not again! Can't bet the originals..find a new script ..
AST2-4db4ic,ÁæéÁâàÂ∞èÊó∂‰ª£ÂíØÔºü
AST2-4db4ic,First thing that came to mind: Saoirse Ronan and Timoth√©e Chalamet are the new generation Chris Evans and Scarlett Johanssen. It seems like they will be together in almost everything to come.
AST2-4db4ic,Better make room in the freezer
AST2-4db4ic,Only here because of FRIENDS. Rachel gave this book to joey
AST2-4db4ic,"Wow,love‚Äôin it"
AST2-4db4ic,Rachel : Beth die
AST2-4db4ic,This looks boring af
AST2-4db4ic,Loosely based on the book
AST2-4db4ic,Omg I just finished reading the booküò≤great just great.
AST2-4db4ic,I really need this trailer song !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,LOVE THIS
AST2-4db4ic,I Like Emma Watson
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone know the song in the background at the end of the trailer it sounds so familiar and its killing me looking for it
AST2-4db4ic,I always hated Amy so much in the book but now they‚Äôve got Florence Pugh playing her and now my mind is confused
AST2-4db4ic,"The '94 version was so natural. It didn't feel forced. Something about this feels forced and I think it has to do with the costumes. You have a superstar cast, passionate acting, great direction and cinematography and mismatched costumes..."
AST2-4db4ic,"Meryl Streep's ""w-well that's because I'm rich.!"" gets me every time üòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,Ah the book that makes joey cried
AST2-4db4ic,"""They were no longer little girls, now they are little women""
For the 40th the time."
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee and saoirse again üòç can't wait ü§ó
AST2-4db4ic,"What is this? A current-year movie that isn't swapping genders or races? Then again, it is about white women and white women get everything they want and everything made the way they want it."
AST2-4db4ic,Emma üòçüòçüòçüòç
AST2-4db4ic,Feminism is cancer !
AST2-4db4ic,"SPOILER ALERT: Honestly,I can get over the fact that Jo didnt marry Laurie, but the thing that I can not get over is the fact that SHE MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE!!! If she never married I would think that is great,I would understand , but she refused Laurie whop loved her just the way she was, who understood her and later married way older dude...."
AST2-4db4ic,Emma should be Jo.
AST2-4db4ic,Im sick of it too! Woman are so much more than that
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse ronan üíïüíïüíïüíïüíï
AST2-4db4ic,WHAT A CAST!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,omg Saoirse is an awesome actress !
AST2-4db4ic,Won't watch it. Remakes suck.
AST2-4db4ic,Where is Louis Garrel?
AST2-4db4ic,oh no i saw Timoth√©e ‚ô°
AST2-4db4ic,What's the song?
AST2-4db4ic,WHIIIIIIIITE PEEEEOPLE
AST2-4db4ic,How does timothee chalamet get 10 times hotter with every movie. Enough already I can't handle him getting better looking
AST2-4db4ic,"Hermione,s oh sorry Emma,s hair got brown to black I feel"
AST2-4db4ic,awe man this trailer just made me fall in love with Timoth√©e Chalamet all over again
AST2-4db4ic,You're not oppressed.
AST2-4db4ic,I am manly enough to admit that I want to see this movie
AST2-4db4ic,I'm here only for Emma Watson
AST2-4db4ic,"I remember watching the anime version of it, Tales of Little Women.
Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth March."
AST2-4db4ic,Little Women Again? Bleh.
AST2-4db4ic,Nice try Hollywood! Taking a 19th century novel and modernizing with the way they talk.. Nope.... Can't top the 94' version.  Nothing new under the sun anymore.
AST2-4db4ic,Can't they do a reboot of little women from the men's perspective ? Kinda of like Ghostbusters?
AST2-4db4ic,This looks sub par! Movies used to be about quality and pride in production value. This is a cheap remake to earn a few extra bucks and looks over dramatized.
AST2-4db4ic,I still see hermione. Sorry not sorry
AST2-4db4ic,A friend like Teddy please
AST2-4db4ic,"Timothe√© Chalamet, Florence Pugh, AND Eliza Scanlen all in one movie!? This movie is just oozing with rising Hollywood talent! üôåüèº"
AST2-4db4ic,"Oh wow, awesome trailer and the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sick of it‚Äô section is really moving. <3"
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm sorry, but this casting is not great at all. Watson as stunning Meg? Nah. I can maybe accept Ronan as Jo, but Winona was still miles better. Same with Christian Bale as Laurie. Laurie was a gentleman, he had innocence but at the same time masculinity. I can't see it with this guy. Timoth√©e  looks too boyish. Not to mention the chemistry between Winona and Bale can't be topped."
AST2-4db4ic,Looks stupid. Original was better
AST2-4db4ic,America's Triplet Cinemas Show-stoppers Greta √ó Saoirse √ó Timothee.
AST2-4db4ic,we're going ‚úàÔ∏è best picture ladies!
AST2-4db4ic,"Now, Rach, these little women. How little are they? I mean, are they, like, scary little?"
AST2-4db4ic,"Please, Hollywood, don't ruin my beloved classic! After watching this trailer, I'm sorry, but - nah. It feels forced.  Although I like Timoth√©e very much, he doesn't fit Laurie part at all, for me. Laurie was a man of the world in the book, he had mix of delicacy and romanticism in himself, and at the same time was very masculine, especially adult Laurie. Christian Bale was just perfect casting, he has all of it, plus if you read about Bale's life it is almost like he was Laurie. Laurie had a pianist mother and traveled a lot, Bale traveled most of his childhood with his mother's circus and with his father, an ex-pilot. Both Lauire and Bale led an artistic bohemian life at some point. Timoth√©e has romanticism and tenderness, but not enough manhood, he looks like baby all the time. I will watch it in cinema, but I don't have high hopes. Winona&Christian were perfect as Jo&Laurie."
AST2-4db4ic,It gave me a fit
AST2-4db4ic,where is Emma?!!
AST2-4db4ic,i am so excited I AM SO EXCITED
AST2-4db4ic,Precursors of today's feminist scourge.
AST2-4db4ic,"Lady Bird casts reunited





*I could die peacefully now*"
AST2-4db4ic,How come no one is talking about the 1933 and 1949 versions. Those were the OGs and had a great cast in both films! I like them better than these other versions
AST2-4db4ic,I can't wait the list of people in this movie is just too much and Greta Gerwib directing? help I need this now
AST2-4db4ic,This is soooo greta gerwig. I loveeeeee it
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm just surprised and wondering 
Why Emma Watson agreed to do a film with so small character"
AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse, Timoth√©e, Meryl Streep, Emma Watson, and Laura Dern. One of the greatest casts I‚Äôve seen."
AST2-4db4ic,"This is already amazing. I cant wait to watch it. Emma,Saoirse and others are a perfect cast for this."
AST2-4db4ic,‚ÄúLonely Ever After‚Äù
AST2-4db4ic,"*America's Triplet Cinemas Show-stoppers*

Greta √ó Saoirse √ó Timothee."
AST2-4db4ic,Is this the little woman from the friends series?
AST2-4db4ic,"No hate, but am i the only one who thinks Saoirse and timothee's chemistry seems kinda forced?, i hope Saoirse and Louis Garrel as professor Bhaer have a great  chemistry."
AST2-4db4ic,Not sure about the casting choice to play Laurie.  Still looking forward to seeing it!
AST2-4db4ic,*Flashbacks to diary of a wimpy kid
AST2-4db4ic,Amazing trailer üòä‚úå
AST2-4db4ic,Very handsome DiCaprio.
AST2-4db4ic,"Triggered: I grew up reading this book and it's a masterpiece, this remake is why I hate modern feminism. This completely side-tracks and subverts the narrative to fit into what we think the author should have meant when she was very clear, in order to fit with what we have now come to make of feminism and it bastardizes a complex, multi-themed, intricate, Bible-lengthed work of litterature and dresses it up as cheap street corner two cents feminism.... Uggggh! It's also porn for celebrity addicts who were dying to see all those actors together -hoorah great actors in a bad movie-, great way to pack the theaters : stars as bait a misleading title when in fact the wisdom of Louisa May Alcott is being butchered....
 I hate our society.
The novel criticises the very fabric of society, and consequently sexism as well as many other social behaviours that would make a few wine moms and basic girls feel self-conscious about themselves, it's clear they are simply trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator and teach nothing, merely repeating a few lines in an orwellian way, no one actually remebering what it means."
AST2-4db4ic,"Sorry, Laura Durn was ruined for me permanently after seeing The Last Jedi. Great in Jurassic Park but then that stupid purple hair movie. I‚Äôll never watch a movie with her in it :/"
AST2-4db4ic,Greta Gerwig ... you've done it again
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know the trailer song for this?
AST2-4db4ic,I need to see this!!üòç
AST2-4db4ic,Coming Christmas 1994
AST2-4db4ic,Am I tripping or does it look like they made Beth the youngest?
AST2-4db4ic,"This cast!!!
Greta Gerwig üß°üß°"
AST2-4db4ic,OMFG I CANT WAIT. ONE OF MY FAVOURITE NOVELS PLUS THE BESTEST CAST WE COULD ASK FOR? YES PLEASE.
AST2-4db4ic,Laura Dern is in this?? I have to go see this now!!
AST2-4db4ic,Who else couldn't care less about this stupid movie and is only here for Emma Watson?
AST2-4db4ic,"Timmy and saoirse, AGAIN?? 
Me : YASSHüî•"
AST2-4db4ic,Can Emma Watson pull off a respectable American accent?
AST2-4db4ic,I'd watch it if it weren't for Meryl Streep.
AST2-4db4ic,"Wow awesome. Cant believe it
 I love this movie so much and all actresses"
AST2-4db4ic,looks ridiculous
AST2-4db4ic,"Is it also time for an Anne of Greene Gables movie?

Yes I think it is time"
AST2-4db4ic,i don‚Äôt think im emotionally ready for jo and laurie to not end up together
AST2-4db4ic,"This movie is blatantly sexist. 
Proves the existence of the matriarchy. 
It should be renamed ‚ÄúLittle People‚Äù. This is 2019 for god‚Äôs sake!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,If there's Maryl Streep then I am bound to watch it
AST2-4db4ic,I love Little Women but honestly don't know how I feel about this. I really don't know that it's necessary. There are so many versions now...but I'm always willing to give them a shot. I like these actresses in certain things but just don't know if I'll like them in this. We'll see...
AST2-4db4ic,üíõüíõüíõüíõ
AST2-4db4ic,"Another one? Seriously? Aren‚Äôt there like five movies of this damn story already? What‚Äôs next, Cinderella 16?"
AST2-4db4ic,I think Emma Watson should've been Jo.
AST2-4db4ic,"If Netflix woulda made this, half the sisters would've been black"
AST2-4db4ic,"Little women hunh, they don't look so little to me."
AST2-4db4ic,So exciting!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"*""Well thats because I'm rich""*"
AST2-4db4ic,we gotta get over white mediocrity
AST2-4db4ic,"Dismissively: ""Well that's because I'm rich."" Wish I could say that, but alas!"
AST2-4db4ic,Ronan for Oscar
AST2-4db4ic,"3 tracks used: 
- Wawa by the ocean by Mary Lattimore
- Wasting Time by Katie Herzig
- Finder by Cyrus Reynolds
Have a great day!"
AST2-4db4ic,What is this again?
AST2-4db4ic,Little Women has been a story that has resonated with me since the first time I read it and it will always have a special place in my heart. I MUST SEE
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone know what song they used for this?
AST2-4db4ic,"Judging from the director's history, I can tell this film is going to be forgettable. Whatever happened to passion?"
AST2-4db4ic,All this does is remind me of that one episode of friends
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma watson is marrying someone with alot of wrinkles, and saoirse character seems to be interested in someone who looks about 10 years younger then her. Is this a part of the story or just weird casting?"
AST2-4db4ic,2:03 HAS MY FUCKING FIST OUT AND READY TO FIGHT
AST2-4db4ic,There kinda tall tho
AST2-4db4ic,little woman maaaaaa B
AST2-4db4ic,OMG
AST2-4db4ic,Dying to see it ü•∞
AST2-4db4ic,"An unnecessary remake. Ugh, nothing can touch Christian Bale and Winona Ryder as. Jo & Laurie. Will stream this one online, lol"
AST2-4db4ic,A movie chalked full of SJW fem nazis. ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
AST2-4db4ic,This would probably be the greatest  movie ever shown if Sony pictures were not attached to it
AST2-4db4ic,Sha-luh-mey
AST2-4db4ic,Midsommar girl
AST2-4db4ic,Joe mama
AST2-4db4ic,I literally just started reading this book
AST2-4db4ic,35mm photography is GORGEOUS
AST2-4db4ic,Turned off when I saw timothee chalamet with a Winona Ryder classic. Came back and stayed for saoirise ronan
AST2-4db4ic,This trailer is the Little Women Louisa May Alcott wrote she dreamed of creating but the times wouldn't let her. I'm crying.
AST2-4db4ic,Beth dies.
AST2-4db4ic,timoth√©e as laurie... my entire body just went numb
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse is so gorgeous. I can't üòç
AST2-4db4ic,Just call it Oscar Bait
AST2-4db4ic,this shits amazing man
AST2-4db4ic,How many times will they remake this
AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse is in it, so I'm going to watch it."
AST2-4db4ic,You need to make GTA 5 cross play
AST2-4db4ic,SONG AT 1:22?
AST2-4db4ic,omg saoirse and timothee I can‚Äôt üò©üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Why does this look like it was filmed in 2006
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee played in one of my favorite LGBT movies of this time and I would recommend him for any role üíú
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the song at the end??
AST2-4db4ic,Deadass just did this play
AST2-4db4ic,"Ok, Best actress: Saoirse.
Best supporting actress: of course Meryl, i know she will have her 4th Oscar."
AST2-4db4ic,Barf
AST2-4db4ic,Hermione
AST2-4db4ic,But the movie from 1994 had the best cast! And was so beautifully done....I'm curious but why cant we leave the classics alone and come up with some original movies??
AST2-4db4ic,Couldn‚Äôt get anyone well-known for the cast.
AST2-4db4ic,Wow i never thought i'd see Saiorse Ronan and Emma Watson in one movie
AST2-4db4ic,Maybe this will make us forget about Cats
AST2-4db4ic,Why do we need another one again?? Sick of movies based on things
AST2-4db4ic,Meh..
AST2-4db4ic,"""Ha! Beth dies"" - Rachel Green"
AST2-4db4ic,This cast is golden
AST2-4db4ic,"idk... I wanted to like this, but the accents are all over the place, especially Saoirse's and Emma's. And the actress playing Amy makes her look like the oldest of the March girls (when she's supposed to be the youngest).
I love Little Women and its various film adaptations, but I might have to pass on this latest iteration."
AST2-4db4ic,"Of all the movies to remake ...and do we really need MORE remakes, OF COURSE they choose a movie with not one, not two, not three, but four WOMEN leads! Wait, how come they didn‚Äôt change them to four black women? It was ok to recast Ariel but not these characters? Hmm, will they change the story and make someone lesbian and someone transgender? If not, why is it ok to change all of these things in other movies but not this one?"
AST2-4db4ic,Ahhhhhhhh i just can‚Äôt wait
AST2-4db4ic,I hope this isn‚Äôt another f-d up remake
AST2-4db4ic,OH IM SO ABOUT IT
AST2-4db4ic,This looks epic!
AST2-4db4ic,"I also love that we don't see Louis Garrel as Friedrich Bhaer. 





Or Bob Odenkirk as Mr. March"
AST2-4db4ic,"My favorite Little Women movie had Evelyn Hugo in it.








Aaaand nobody got that reference."
AST2-4db4ic,Is that faze rug?
AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse and Timothy playing Jo and Laurie, I don¬¥t buy. The looks very young for the role."
AST2-4db4ic,Does the music playing in the back exist outside this trailer? Please say yes.
AST2-4db4ic,And the oscar goes to...Meryl Streep
AST2-4db4ic,"Elk√©peszt≈ë √©s tragikus, hogy Hollywood mekkora √∂tlettelens√©gben szenved.

AST2-4db4ic,Yes finally I love the book and the other version with winona ryder and the show too I cannot wait for this i been waiting for a year and now it‚Äôs here plus I love the sisters
AST2-4db4ic,"I closed my eyes, just listened to the dialogues.  If I didn‚Äôt know Little Women, I would think that this is a movie set in today.  The way they talk is very modern, not period."
AST2-4db4ic,Who Loves Emma ???????üòç
AST2-4db4ic,IM SO EXCITED
AST2-4db4ic,Such a great cast üíï
AST2-4db4ic,thought it was a midget movie
AST2-4db4ic,This is the little women we deserve. I loved the original story and I know I'm going to love this movie because it looks like it's going to be done right üëèüëèüëèüëè
AST2-4db4ic,Little women is one of the most dogshit books of all timeü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

AST2-4db4ic,I started crying I‚Äôm so excited
AST2-4db4ic,"Why of all sisters Meg (I think that's Emma Watson's character's name) has British accent? I mean, couldn't she try to sound more American?"
AST2-4db4ic,i can't wait to watch this!
AST2-4db4ic,It looks like lady bird taking place in a Jane Austin novel
AST2-4db4ic,"Me: ""This stupid book has been made in to a movie/tv show like 4 times in the past 2 years.""
Trailer: ""Starring Emma Watson... and Meryl Streep.""
Me: ""FinNE TaKE My MoNEy!"""
AST2-4db4ic,I adooooore Emma and Meryl üíñüíñüíñ
AST2-4db4ic,Just saying - you should have got Jennifer Aniston to be in this movie. Just cause she was a fan of the book in Friends lol
AST2-4db4ic,I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE ENOUGH SAID.
AST2-4db4ic,I'm in love in Saoirse! I love everything about her! I could watch her acting forever.
AST2-4db4ic,YESYESYESYES
AST2-4db4ic,"pretty feminist but for the time period doesn‚Äôt seem to unreasonable. We will see if they mess that up through the events of the actual film. I don‚Äôt see much wrong with it. I can see many Cliche, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be terrible. Just ok."
AST2-4db4ic,Doesn‚Äôt anyone know there 2 little women films and there the best the first one star Elizabeth Taylor ie amy where the background was cardboard
AST2-4db4ic,I can't wait...for real
AST2-4db4ic,"As one grows older, I wonder why I need to see yet another remake of this. (There was a modern film version released last year!) How many times do I need to see another Romeo & Juliet or Hamlet or Batman for that matter. Well, I, nor anyone, don't have to, yet here it is anyway."
AST2-4db4ic,I think Meryl is going to drop some great one liners and I can‚Äôt wait üòé
AST2-4db4ic,Didnt this come out last year?
AST2-4db4ic,Didnt this come out last year?
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone know the music used in this trailer?

AST2-4db4ic,I cant wait üòçüòç
AST2-4db4ic,YASSS QUEEENNNNNN
AST2-4db4ic,I think Emma Watson's accent is not too bad! Don't think it warrants the hate.
AST2-4db4ic,I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be this excited
AST2-4db4ic,"This will probably go down as one of the most boring, toxic feminism-laden remakes ever. Hate me now, but wait for it. I hope I‚Äôm wrong, as a fan of the last one."

AST2-4db4ic,"Well this is an epic crossover between Hanna, Call me by your name, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, Midsommar and The Hours.

As long as there's a T-rex I'm in"
AST2-4db4ic,Meh
AST2-4db4ic,I'm going to take a wild guess and say the four Little Women are ladyboys that is gay boys with women's clothing on Hollywood does ironic stuff like that all the time
AST2-4db4ic,YESYESYESYES
AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse and Timoth√©e have SUCH great chemistry, I'm so excited to see them in a movie together again!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Beth Dies.
J.k. I just wanted to hurt you."
AST2-4db4ic,"Joeys voice ""Beth... beth dies?"""
AST2-4db4ic,This woman empowerment stuff is getting a bit much.......
AST2-4db4ic,these other actors/actresses make emma watson look basic.
AST2-4db4ic,Eliza better get the screen time she deserves
AST2-4db4ic,"Y'all better not screw this up! Little women has always been a story near and dear to my heart, hopefully they will do it justice."
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Timothee are equivalent of Kate and Leo for me. *Am I alone?*
AST2-4db4ic,"Looking forward to this, but 1994 version will always be my favorite."
AST2-4db4ic,"i know it's too early to say this, but i love this proposal scene more than the winona ryder/christian bale version already"
AST2-4db4ic,U r my favourite Emma since Harry potter love from India ‚ù§üáÆüá≥
AST2-4db4ic,Looks way better than Charlie's Angels!
AST2-4db4ic,Thumbs up to you and your fam! We just passed 100 subs. On fire - right? ha. haha!!
AST2-4db4ic,"Wow, it's about time."
AST2-4db4ic,Why is there no Bob odenkirk in the trailer
AST2-4db4ic,SONY WHY YOU HAD TO KILL LOCOMOTION CHANNEL WHYYYYüò≠
AST2-4db4ic,Living for this and for Jo wanting to be a famous writer
AST2-4db4ic,1:33 I will watch this part every day until the movie comes out.
AST2-4db4ic,Not digging this version of Laurie. Christian Bale was much better
AST2-4db4ic,Emma i Love uuuu
AST2-4db4ic,My heart broke when Laurie and Jo didn't end up together!...I didn't see it coming and could not understand or accept it for a long time as a kid. It is easier now that  I am an adult
AST2-4db4ic,From the looks of it this film at least will be oscar nominated. If not the film the cast / crew will
AST2-4db4ic,another movie created for sad and ugly women to make them feel powerful. lmao.
AST2-4db4ic,This movie reminds me 90s tv show.
AST2-4db4ic,Another feminist movie
AST2-4db4ic,Look extremely boring... Instant streaming
AST2-4db4ic,That episode of friends when Joey reads this book. Was just on TBS. WTF
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm already crying over Beth
AST2-4db4ic,Pleasant surprise seeing timothee chalamet.
AST2-4db4ic,Beth dies.
AST2-4db4ic,Finally a movie I can watch with mom
AST2-4db4ic,Love the music
AST2-4db4ic,"I see you, Emma Watson!!!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Who else thinks Greta has changed the ending and Jo ends up alone, feminist style?! (This trailer heavily emphasizes Jo‚Äôs independent views and there is no showing of her relationship with bhaer in this trailer)"
AST2-4db4ic,Where can ƒ± find the song? ƒ∞t is just incredible
AST2-4db4ic,We have to put this movie in the freezer. its scary
AST2-4db4ic,Perfect Casting!
AST2-4db4ic,Who is here because of Emma Watson ?
AST2-4db4ic,So Emma only acts in movie adaptation of famous books only?üßêüòäüòä
AST2-4db4ic,üíú
AST2-4db4ic,What is the song that plays at 1:04? I NEED TO KNOW
AST2-4db4ic,"Meryl Streep the Queen and 
Emma Stone Belle"
AST2-4db4ic,Like for Jo
AST2-4db4ic,Lol Everyone calls me Jo because thats my name she was my favorite
AST2-4db4ic,"Well, at least they didn't add ""LESBIAN"" here
(No offense, lesbians)"
AST2-4db4ic,"Really, really sorry to ask, but, could you guys tell me what the music within this trailer is (from the second half of the trailer)??? I really like it, but otherwise, I love this trailer!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Welcome to the 1000000th remake of this movie. Really enough hollywood, dont u have another story?"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm already crying over Beth
AST2-4db4ic,What‚Äôs the music?
AST2-4db4ic,This is what feminist think the world is still like
AST2-4db4ic,Another remake.....Hollywood out of ideas
AST2-4db4ic,Read the book as teenager.....seen all the movies based on it....looking very much forward to this one!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"This better not have some fanfic BS where Jo marries Laurie--the whole point of Alcott having him marry ""her"" is to spite the fangirls that pissed her off. It would only be right to continue honoring her wishes."
AST2-4db4ic,I smell an oscar nominations already
AST2-4db4ic,boring already
AST2-4db4ic,"So i consider myself a feminist and i agree with everything this trailer stands for, my only problem is why must we always be so PREACHY with our beliefs??? The 90s version showed a really strong, independent and creative Jo without all the dialogue ab ‚Äúwhyyyyyy must a woman...????‚Äù Even the 80s Anne of Green Gables/Avonlea with Meagan Follows had strong feminism without all the mouthiness. Anne became a teacher and a writer and just like Jo she shrugged off her best friend but in the end both women get married to somebodyüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I think in this day and age women are 100x more independent so the idea that there needs to be a narrative dragging marriage is unnecesaary. You dont even see that type sh*t in films anymore, not when u have female protagonists like Rey or Black Widow, etc. We have been out of the Damsel in Distress ages for yearrrrrssss. So i just feel like the loud message is SERIOUSLY unnecessary. I also dont like the fact that this film seems wayyyyyy too...‚Äùmodern?‚Äù Too relaxed, as if a bunch of besties decided to film a college film project without taking time to learn the accents and behaviors from back in those days. I adore the cast, they were perfect and im tired of timmie getting friend zoned by saoirse (LOLOLOLüòÇüòÇüòÇ) but i hope this movie surprises me. I will definitely see it but the accents are super cringey. They all sound like theyre some LA Natives or somethingüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,"I watch all period films and then score them on how many (nihilist) modernist anachronisms are being forced on me. The British, mainly, have been producing low-anachronism period films and series now for a few years -- and some of them are simply wonderful. (e.g. the 2011 _Jane Eyre_ ) This latest LW, however, looks a bit fraught -- but I shouldn't judge just by a trailer. I guess I'm saying we have a lot to learn from the 19th century, not the other way around."
AST2-4db4ic,"I want to be rich. no buts.

finally a favorite novel with favorite actresses Saoirse and Meryl Streep"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôve been waiting for this my entire life.
AST2-4db4ic,"wow, what a milestone, 100th adaptation... because no one asked for it. ty sony!"
AST2-4db4ic,Feminism is cancer
AST2-4db4ic,Hard to beat Elizabeth Taylor and Kristen dunset as Amy
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse nation make some noise!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Knowing I played Aunt March in my schools musical and Meryl Streep is now playing Aunt March has made my day 1000x better
AST2-4db4ic,Ahhhhhhh üíìüíìüíìüíìüíìüíì
AST2-4db4ic,"Dang, I gotta watch Laurie and Jo NOT end up together again. I gotta remember how I will never be satisfied with life."
AST2-4db4ic,Looks terrible and cliche
AST2-4db4ic,Finally Emma and soirsa together
AST2-4db4ic,Looks alright
AST2-4db4ic,"Meg looks exactly how Jo does in Little Men, and Jo looks exactly how Meg does in Little Men."
AST2-4db4ic,Florence Pugh is in every movie this year it seems
AST2-4db4ic,someone pleaseeeee tell me what the song from 1:22 onwards is ?!!
AST2-4db4ic,"""I don't need no man"""
AST2-4db4ic,"""Im so sick of people saying that love is just all a women is fit for"" No, you are not sick of it. You are a sick feminazi living in the 19th  century. Wait for more Sci - Feminazi from hollywood. By the way, you need a man to  cure your illness."
AST2-4db4ic,If you‚Äôve read this book then you‚Äôre og
AST2-4db4ic,"They couldn't have made a more modern version to be more inclusive. Wow a movie about White people who fall in love and have wonderful lives how original. blah,  blah, blah"
AST2-4db4ic,"Looks promising. Just don't ruin this with your so-so acting, Emma Watson. üòè"
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúNow Rach, these little women. How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little??‚Äù"
AST2-4db4ic,Ya‚Äôll keep talking about Joe and Laurie rejection in the book but your forgetting Beth‚Äôs death smh ;-;
AST2-4db4ic,F.R.I.E.N.D.S. anyone ??
AST2-4db4ic,Who else is here only for *Emma Watson*
AST2-4db4ic,The cast for this movie is all wrong
AST2-4db4ic,But why is Amy here so much more older than she actually is in the book?
AST2-4db4ic,Why is the lighting so dark?
AST2-4db4ic,This made me touch my feminine side
AST2-4db4ic,Okay so is there any chance Greta Gerwig is gonna be a real one and just make Laurie and Jo end up together?? Switch it up??
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm so excited!!! Little Women is one of my favorite movies and books!!!
AST2-4db4ic,This cast. Under Greta‚Äôs direction. I am so excited for this.
AST2-4db4ic,rachel spoiled it for me
AST2-4db4ic,is it a coincidence that my favorite actor is timoth√©e and my favorite actress is saoirse? NO.

AST2-4db4ic,"I'm a simple man, I see the disgusting Meryl Streep, I dislike and will never give my time or money to anything she works on. 
She's the best friend of Roman Polanski (the child rapist of a 13y old and still current fugitive from justice) and Harvey Weinstein  (the king pig of Hollywood)"

AST2-4db4ic,"Oh well, getting ready to have my heart broken over Jo and Laurie for the 193736721081th time"
AST2-4db4ic,Okay this looks awesome and emma Watson is really well cast as Meg. I thought her being involved would be a turn off but her and meg definitely have a similar way about them. And of course Saorice Ronan just brings it so much I couldn't pass on this. Definjtely want to see it in theaters with my mom and my sister. One of the few movies we all love. And beth...well I'll have to bring some tissues.
AST2-4db4ic,"I see Emma Watson, I click. Simple as that!"
AST2-4db4ic,Where is my emma Watson
AST2-4db4ic,"You are not married yet

AST2-4db4ic,It‚Äôs time to put the book in the freezer joeyüòÇüòÇüòÇ
AST2-4db4ic,This movie is already ruined because of cuz of 90s sitcom show ‚ÄúFriends‚ÄùüòÇ

AST2-4db4ic,"3 Words. Joey, Rachel and Friends."
AST2-4db4ic,At 12 I had my first otp Jo and Laurie and now watching this trailer I got the feels again
AST2-4db4ic,Is racism prevalent in this movie?
AST2-4db4ic,HARD PASS
AST2-4db4ic,I only know as much of Little Women as Joey Tribiani.
AST2-4db4ic,This looks awesome üëçüëçüëçüëç
AST2-4db4ic,Am only going to watch it cause I love hermione
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan is coming for her 4th Oscar nominated
AST2-4db4ic,Tbh I usually find little women really irritating and soppy but this actually looks pretty decent
AST2-4db4ic,Is there seriously no new movie ideas in Hollywood???
AST2-4db4ic,"Little girl with little prettiness,come soon,we love you Sony pics..."
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl Streep is in the house!!
AST2-4db4ic,Okay but what a gorgeous piece of music.
AST2-4db4ic,She marries the old guy because the author was in love with her dad's friend in real life.
AST2-4db4ic,This looks so dead boring...
AST2-4db4ic,Do we need another one??
AST2-4db4ic,What cracks me up is I read the book (and fell in love with it ) because of Friends üòÖ
AST2-4db4ic,I got my Christmas plans now
AST2-4db4ic,You go see a movie you just supported pedophilia and child trafficking and adrenochrome drinking and hollyweird
AST2-4db4ic,"WOW! A FEMALE LEAD?!

TAKE MY MONEY!"
AST2-4db4ic,Why is it so sad that this is all still relevant. All of the stuff being said has been said to me even today.
AST2-4db4ic,Barf
AST2-4db4ic,:/  hmm.....    I think I'd much prefer the 1949 version.    The marketing direction has already turned me off from what could otherwise be a fantastic adaptation with this amazing cast.
AST2-4db4ic,If I keep reading. Beth's gonna die...
AST2-4db4ic,"Saoirse Ronan nice to meet you on my favorite person Jo, you got it!!!"

AST2-4db4ic,"I might be in a very very very small minority but Chalamet's Laurie isn't doing much for me, idk why, he's just coming across as suave and whiny at the same time...I hope the movie does well, Saoirse as Jo and Florence Pugh as Amy is quite literally a coup, they are perfect."
AST2-4db4ic,I really wish the ending was different for this classic story.
AST2-4db4ic,"Whoever watched friends, already knows the ending ü§≠üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,It's gonna be tough to beat the one starring Winona Ryder but this trailer is stunning in every way. Can't wait.
AST2-4db4ic,yeeEEEEEEEEESS YES YES YES
AST2-4db4ic,another trash movie with feminist content. *disappointing*
AST2-4db4ic,This looks incredible
AST2-4db4ic,i smell oscars
AST2-4db4ic,"I was about to skip this one.
Then I saw Timothee Chalamet in the trailer.....

I STOPPED"
AST2-4db4ic,Gross. Emma Watson is involved.
AST2-4db4ic,Emma cant act  tho! Bye Herman!
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson is so desperate to be Kirsten Dunst..It's pathetic.
AST2-4db4ic,Little WOKE women.  I vomit.
AST2-4db4ic,"Ehhh... the 90‚Äôs version still wins out in my opinion, but timothlee is very hot in period clothes xD"
AST2-4db4ic,The actors picked seem perfect but personally I loved the 1994 remake and I really hope this one lives up to or surpasses. Putting my faith in Greta that all will be well.
AST2-4db4ic,EW + SR?! Wow!!!
AST2-4db4ic,it's gonna be hard taking the 1994 cast outta my head but am excited for this one
AST2-4db4ic,Greta Gerwig did it again
AST2-4db4ic,Emma‚ô•Ô∏è Timoth√©e ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Meryl Streep‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

AST2-4db4ic,"Only reason I know this, because of Friends, when Joey reads Rachel‚Äôs book"
AST2-4db4ic,"Holy crap, this looks fantastic!"
AST2-4db4ic,Florence as little Amy might make me like her for once lol.
AST2-4db4ic,wait though are they gonna have Professor Bhaer? I love female empowerment queen Jo but like... should I expect my OG little women? or are they putting their own spin on it?
AST2-4db4ic,So extremely excited for Greta Gerwig‚Äôs 2nd movie as the leading lady in charge (Director). Everyone is buzzing about the actors but I‚Äôm all her for Greta.
AST2-4db4ic,Nice
AST2-4db4ic,Everything me being so excited about the actors. But the actor isn‚Äôt the one who makes the film the director is. My all time fav 2 actors are in this (Saoirse + Timmy). But I‚Äôm more enthusiastic about Greta Gerwig who is such a fabulous female writer and director and it‚Äôs. She has already accomplished so much with her first film and is hopefully ready for more great accolades in her career.
AST2-4db4ic,Desperate waiting!
AST2-4db4ic,"I think Greta Gerwig will be like Wes Anderson in the future, getting these crazy casts for every movie."
AST2-4db4ic,Excited üò¨‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,I wish this movie will in Vietnam üáªüá≥
AST2-4db4ic,imo the movie with Winona Ryder was done just fine...hate when they keep redoin the same movie.
AST2-4db4ic,More feminism garbage
AST2-4db4ic,1994 version best version
AST2-4db4ic,Do we really need a retelling of this?  Are we completely out of original ideas?
AST2-4db4ic,"Oh, I can just hear the SJWs screeching now. No POC or LGBT. Last I check it one of the best selling novels of all time. Written for and about women. So, I would hope that would count for something."
AST2-4db4ic,So in the movies the democrats push for independence but in politics they push for socialism???
AST2-4db4ic,"0:37

Why do I find that nod by Saoirse so attractive wtf üòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan keeps making the right choices.
AST2-4db4ic,Winona Forever!
AST2-4db4ic,"LOL, with this trailer i dont need to see the movie."

AST2-4db4ic,Yay white people
AST2-4db4ic,Does anyone know what song or songs are playing in the background I recognize them but can't figure it out!
AST2-4db4ic,Not seen this but for me the Little Women with Wynona Rider and Kirsten Dunst and Susan Sarandon will forever be my favourite because it's the one I grew up with. For me when I read the book those are the faces that I see.
AST2-4db4ic,How many times are they going to remake this tired old movie?
AST2-4db4ic,Maybe if I watch this adaptation of the book...I'll be able to understand the book itself.
AST2-4db4ic,This looks very well acted and the cinematography is stunning!
AST2-4db4ic,*I can‚Äôt wait to fall in love with Timothee Chalamet all over again*
AST2-4db4ic,Emma watson ü•∞
AST2-4db4ic,Another generation of little women. My favourite was with Claire Danes. Best death scene ever for this story hands down.

AST2-4db4ic,"Unless I'm seeing things, why did they make Beth look younger than Amy? Beth is older than Amy."
AST2-4db4ic,Looks boring
AST2-4db4ic,I smell Oscar!!
AST2-4db4ic,"I hope this movie get nominated for Oscars, that's the only way I get to see this movie in movie theater."
AST2-4db4ic,SWEET MOTHER OF ALL VIRGINS I LOVE THIS ALREADY
AST2-4db4ic,"But....we already have a great Little Women movie with Claire Danes, Wynona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, etc..."
AST2-4db4ic,Umumumumumum. Everyone helps out a petition to help get rid of the CEO that's ruining this platform  Um boring.
AST2-4db4ic,"Cool, so I'm already crying and it's just the trailer. (My gosh I cannot wait to see this adaptation.)"
AST2-4db4ic,Florence Pughs agent has been busy
AST2-4db4ic,"I think this story is coming out in a really great time where women empowerment is at its highest and needed. My school did a phenomenal play based on the novel and the author was very ahead of her time realizing that women are more than beautiful brides they‚Äôre smart,courageous,creative and so much more!"
AST2-4db4ic,"This is definitely going to be a box office smash! üòê

AST2-4db4ic,My school did a phenomenal play about this last year and I‚Äôm very excited to see it as a film now!

AST2-4db4ic,This looks absolutely amazing! Does anyone know what songs they used in the trailer?
AST2-4db4ic,Why is no one talking about the wonky accents? Theyre all over the place. Emma Watsons accent slip was really obvious. Or maybe im just hyper sensitive to it because I watch a lot of movies form different countries idk.
AST2-4db4ic,I really want to see it!! Omg it's my girls!
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm sorry, but Tim will always be Elio to me."
AST2-4db4ic,WORST CINEMATOGRAPHY!
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan as Jo? Emma Watson as Meg? Sign me up! I can't wait to take my mom to see this. Little Women has been something we've bonded over since I first read the books when I was in school.
AST2-4db4ic,this will be the most powerful feminist movie of the year and i can't wait to be empowered!! ‚ô°
AST2-4db4ic,"AHHHHüòÜüòÜ!! So excited for this! At any given time, the world can always use another Little Women movie..."
AST2-4db4ic,"Garbage..horrible cast , especially tired Meryl Streep  always getting her face into everything..so overrated!"
AST2-4db4ic,‚ÄúFriends‚Äù spoiled me this movie more than a decade ago.
AST2-4db4ic,How many times does this movie have to be re made? Seriously. We get it..they're tough women living in another Century...who cars already
AST2-4db4ic,I like the one with Christian bale
AST2-4db4ic,Why does it look like its been recorded with a cheap point and shoot camera from the early 2000's? lmao
AST2-4db4ic,I love timmy timÔºÅÔºÅüíìüíì
AST2-4db4ic,The 1994 adaptation is my favourite.
AST2-4db4ic,This looks amazing! Can‚Äôt wait to watch it!
AST2-4db4ic,Why are they always in films together?
AST2-4db4ic,I can‚Äôt b r eath e
AST2-4db4ic,Anybody knows the music score the are using throughout this trailer ?
AST2-4db4ic,How the hell is it that Timothee Chalamet has the power to make us fall in love with him every time?
AST2-4db4ic,We'll see if it beats the one with Winona Ryder. That's my favorite version.
AST2-4db4ic,"Timoth√©e and Saoirse 
omg i‚Äôm blessed"
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm completely sold from the moment I see ""Little Women"" title. No more explanation. I don't even need to watch the trailer because I know this story by heart. My most favorite novel, the one that opened my passion for literature. ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è

Nah, of course, I'll watch the trailer. Saoirse and Emma are there. It's a sin not to watch. RIP play button."
AST2-4db4ic,saoirse ronan‚Äôs oscar is coming
AST2-4db4ic,Meryl and Timothee?? I‚Äôm in. Plus I liked the booküòÅ
AST2-4db4ic,Yesss can‚Äôt wait
AST2-4db4ic,"Is it just me, or would Timothee and Emma (Meg and Laurie) make a cuter couple?"
AST2-4db4ic,You had me at Streep and Pugh!
AST2-4db4ic,How many times is have they remade this stupid movie?
AST2-4db4ic,IM ACTUALLY EXCITED FOR THIS ADAPTATION
AST2-4db4ic,Looks like another great performance from Saoirse Ronan
AST2-4db4ic,Is this a movie for ANTS?!!
AST2-4db4ic,With this cast how could it fail?? I'm so excited <3333333
AST2-4db4ic,the color grading is unreal just like in Lady Bird... can't wait for this!!
AST2-4db4ic,Noooo
AST2-4db4ic,HERE WE GOO BITCHESSSSSS
AST2-4db4ic,yts am i right
AST2-4db4ic,timmy stans come get yalls juice!!! the drought is over!
AST2-4db4ic,"That's not how I imagined Jo at all, but I still want to see it"
AST2-4db4ic,Oh my. This is incredibly exciting.
AST2-4db4ic,"That harp piece at the start is
Wawa by the Ocean by Mary Lattimore"
AST2-4db4ic,"12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.Time to live righteous like in the olden days and come to Jesus."
AST2-4db4ic,This is sure to have some annoying wokeness.
AST2-4db4ic,i clicked for Emma Watson
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Timoth√©e as Jo and Laurie are so perfect together.
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm sure it will be a wonderful film, but HOW MANY TIMES are they going to tell this story on film??? There have been SO many adaptations of it on the big and small screens that I'm surprised the studio agreed to do another one. Greta Gerwig is an amazing writer and director. Why would she want to do something that's been done almost two dozen times?"
AST2-4db4ic,I hope they don't waste away such a gem of a cast and story. High hopes from this oneü§û
AST2-4db4ic,I hear Oscar bells.
AST2-4db4ic,"Honestly, I would prefer to see Emma as Jo :("
AST2-4db4ic,"Looks like it also has the fun parts, and Saoirse, a must see.
I want the BluRay already."
AST2-4db4ic,A perversion of a great classic they shouldn't have even called it little Women
AST2-4db4ic,Still horrible...
AST2-4db4ic,Great cast! Looking forward to this.
AST2-4db4ic,Oh por Dioooooooos!!! ü§©
AST2-4db4ic,"""So sick of"" smacks of the current age to me. Spoiled the whole trailer for me. Still looks entertaining though."
AST2-4db4ic,This cast is greater than ever. Can't wait to see this adaptation.
AST2-4db4ic,"Pathetic. Save yourself the pain and money and watch the one and only worth your time.
1949 version, real drama and acting."
AST2-4db4ic,I might be a bit attached to the pbs adaptation but I‚Äôm excited for this one too.
AST2-4db4ic,BEST. XMAS. GIFT. EVER. !!!!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Joey Tribbiani needs to watch this so he finally understands it.
AST2-4db4ic,Great ANOTHER remake. As all creative is gone.
AST2-4db4ic,Omg a cast full of amazing peopleAHHH I LEGIT TEARED UP
AST2-4db4ic,"I like Timoth√©e but I‚Äôm a little bored of seeing the exact same kind of acting from him. Take whatever movie he‚Äôs in, he has the same expressions. üò¨üòê"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm so excited to see this version. The 1995 version is my favorite cause it has Wynona Rider and Kristen Dunst In it.
AST2-4db4ic,And the Oscar Best Hair goes to Timoth√©e Chalamet!
AST2-4db4ic,Ohhh my!!!! FINALLY!!!! And what a brilliant trailer with that brilliants score!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,*mAkE iT sHorT AnD sPiCy*
AST2-4db4ic,"Feels too contemporary, somehow. The sensibility, some of the dialogue, the trailer‚Äôs rhythms and fonts ‚Äî a film can remain true to a period without feeling stodgy. Gerwig would do well to learn that lesson. She may have gone too far in trying to give us a Little Women for Millennial audiences. üòï I‚Äôll still see it, but the trailer has left me unimpressed. And I‚Äôve been so excited for this one."
AST2-4db4ic,Please dubbed this movie in hindi......
AST2-4db4ic,Smells like Oscars...
AST2-4db4ic,"Joey: ""These Little Women. ...Wow!"""
AST2-4db4ic,I hope Emma and her wooden acting don‚Äôt ruin either Meg or the movie : /
AST2-4db4ic,Ok. But why? This didn't need to be rebooted or re adapted tbh
AST2-4db4ic,"YOU'RE NOT CRYING, I'M CRYING!"
AST2-4db4ic,I don‚Äôt see how the ‚Äò94 version can be topped. Or should be for that matter. Especially Thomas Newman‚Äôs brilliant score.
AST2-4db4ic,oh wow renata and mary louise what happened
AST2-4db4ic,I forgot this is another generation so of course they're going to remake it again for the next era my personal favorite when I was a child is the one that starred with Kirsten Dunst Winona Ryder Claire Danes Samantha Mathis Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon now that was a star cast but we're talking about almost 30 years ago
AST2-4db4ic,The hype is real! Cant Wait.
AST2-4db4ic,"This movie looks amazing!!! And it has Emma Watson, Timoth√®e Chalamet, and Saoirse Ronan, so it HAS to be amazing!!!! (And it also has Meryl Streep and Laura Dern which is further proof that there is NO WAY that it‚Äôs not going to be great)."
AST2-4db4ic,No thank you
AST2-4db4ic,I always wanted  jo/laurie together üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,"I NEED to see Emma Watson, Saoirse Ronan, and Timothee Chalamet promoting this movie on The Graham Norton Show. I'm 100% into this movie for those three actors in particular."
AST2-4db4ic,"Seems like they're more so bent on the sexist aspect of the story rather than the whole plot. The book isn't just about the people who told Jo she couldn't write, its about all the sisters choosing the lives that they wanted. Its about the way they all grow as people. Hopefully this version captures that."
AST2-4db4ic,"‚ÄúWomen, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts. And they‚Äôve got ambition, and they‚Äôve got talent, as well as beauty, and I‚Äôm so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for. I‚Äôm so sick of it!‚Äù

I felt that."
AST2-4db4ic,OMG ISBEHJEHDIEIWHDIEISHHWJDBANAHSUDSJSIWJHSUEKWVHW HELL YEAH
AST2-4db4ic,YAAAASSS TIMMYYYYYY
AST2-4db4ic,Thanks Sony p.
AST2-4db4ic,"Can't replace Christian Bale and Winona Ryder, ya just can't. I'll keep an open mind, but the previous version will always be better. ü§∑üôå"
AST2-4db4ic,"Surprised they didn't make this a gender swapped remake. Hollywood sure likes to ""represent"""
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirth√©e Nation Rise!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,YESSS MY BABY TIMOTHEEEEE !!!!!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,please CAPTION - how can i see if i think you are envisioning one of my favorite books if I cannot understand the words the characters are saying... please CAPTION so those of us who cannot hear speech can enjoy your work
AST2-4db4ic,The pop music kind of ruins it.
AST2-4db4ic,This story must hold the record for the most film adaptations. I've lost count.
AST2-4db4ic,I grew up watching the Winona Ryder version and love it so much. Im intrigued to watch this one
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse said PERIOD üî¥ pieces ONLY
AST2-4db4ic,Winona Ryder like: is ma version a JOKE to you!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Nahhhh
AST2-4db4ic,"...no one else can be Jo. No one. Don‚Äôt you dare say my Keira Knightley ain‚Äôt appearing in this here film, or Imma have to go all Miss March on your asses"
AST2-4db4ic,"@1:34 I almost expect Jo to break into a song ""Astonishing"" üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
AST2-4db4ic,Out of all the classic literature you could have adapted at least it's not the old man in the sea
AST2-4db4ic,Little Hoes
AST2-4db4ic,what is this song
AST2-4db4ic,one of my favorite books so glad this is an adaptation i can watch!
AST2-4db4ic,"Don‚Äôt be fooled, trust me when i say that all of them teens (of all shapes and colors) will watch this and eat it up like crazy."
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee without Armie is gonna have to take awhile for me. Although I loved Christian Bale. But classics are always done over again and again and again.
AST2-4db4ic,This looks like a beautiful film. Can‚Äôt wait to see it!!! December is too far away!
AST2-4db4ic,these women are of average size
AST2-4db4ic,OH FUCKING HELL I MUST SEE THIS!!
AST2-4db4ic,Aahh I'm freaking out!! I've been waiting for this for months! ü§©üéâ
AST2-4db4ic,Surprised they didn‚Äôt make one of them black
AST2-4db4ic,Awesome
AST2-4db4ic,"Laurie: Jo, we can be together.
Jo: But what about Oliver?"
AST2-4db4ic,"this looks great, I wish it was based off of the musical tho. Still looks amazing"
AST2-4db4ic,"Oprah says: You get an Oscar, you get an Oscar, you also get an Oscar!"
AST2-4db4ic,I wanna hate this so badly. There have been sooooo many remakes.  But the cast. I have to see it now
AST2-4db4ic,Hopefully they don't cut out that super hot bikini scene in this adaptation.
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee Chalamet and Emma Watson in the same movie. sign me up nOW

AST2-4db4ic,So a sjw version of manshaming movie.
AST2-4db4ic,Maybe jo will end up with laurie this time
AST2-4db4ic,This trailer makes me so excited! Just look at that cast! And I'm not trying to compare or anything but I think Saoirse channels that perfect Winona Ryder passion and angst for the role haha.
AST2-4db4ic,My favorite boring book.
AST2-4db4ic,OOOOOOSCAR BAAAAAAAIT!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Thank you!
AST2-4db4ic,Im actually read the book right now lmao. What a coincidence !!!
AST2-4db4ic,This is the best protray of these character
AST2-4db4ic,I have literal tears in my eyes. What an absolutely beautiful trailer. Can't wait to watch the film :)
AST2-4db4ic,Why is Timoth√©e Chalamet so charming in this movie?
AST2-4db4ic,can Jo & Laurie end up together in this adaptation please? just once? PLEASE?
AST2-4db4ic,Oscar Bait
AST2-4db4ic,The only book that Joey loved that isn't starred by Jack Nicholson is now a movie
AST2-4db4ic,1:40 OK WE NEED THE SOUNDTRACK ALBUM NOW MY SPINE IS FEELING THE CHILLS
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma Stone was originally cast in this movie, but her schedule didn't allow her as she had to attend the promotion tour of The Favourite. Emma Watson was chosen instead."
AST2-4db4ic,"1994: Haven‚Äôt been born yet.
2019: *TAKE ME TO SEE IT THIS WILL BE THE FINAL FILM OF THE 2010s DECADE*"
AST2-4db4ic,"I love the fact that people don't just remeber friends, a show that ended 15 years ago, but you can actually  find references to it in the trailer of a book that a character once read in one episode"
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm a big fan of most of the adaptations of this story and with the team involved in this one, it looks like I'll have another to love. :D"
AST2-4db4ic,Eliza Scanlen should've been Amy...she's the baby
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôll wait till they remake this movie again and it‚Äôs about adrienne bailon naturi naughton and kiely williams or it‚Äôs about women with dwarfism who live in LA New York Atlanta and Dallas.
AST2-4db4ic,I think if Emma was joy it's better than mage

AST2-4db4ic,Hopefully they stay true to the ending of the book but this trailer doesn't give me hope for that... still looks amazing though!!!
AST2-4db4ic,A film within a film?
AST2-4db4ic,I'll be the only dude in the theater but sign me up!
AST2-4db4ic,WHY DOES THIS FEEL LIKE A CONTEMPORARY YA NOVEL ADAPTATION WHY DO I LOVE IT
AST2-4db4ic,Timoth√©e kill me already i just love him so much EYE-
AST2-4db4ic,Little Women is one of my favorite books. This trailer looks like the did it right.
AST2-4db4ic,"timothee and emma in the same movie? my 2 favs, I'm dying üò≠üò≠üò≠"
AST2-4db4ic,She married Professor Bhaer. Lol.
AST2-4db4ic,Classic.
AST2-4db4ic,What a lovely lineup.
AST2-4db4ic,I have never fallen asleep during a trailer before
AST2-4db4ic,It‚Äôs too much. TOO MUCH FOR MY POOR HEART THIS BOOK WAS MY LIFE. AND NOW MY MOST LOVABLE ARTISTS IN WHOLE UNIVERSE BRING IT BACK TO LIFE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THIS IS MORE THAN I EVER IMAGINED‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è I LITERALLY CRIED!!!!!!!!!!

Already crying."
AST2-4db4ic,Wtf is this feminist cringe
AST2-4db4ic,pass  ewwww emma watson.that stupid feminist
AST2-4db4ic,I'm a big man who loves Little Women.
AST2-4db4ic,Fact: I'm gonna cry the whole movie.
AST2-4db4ic,There's big women in this too right?
AST2-4db4ic,They look like big women to me.
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson I‚Äôm so happy
AST2-4db4ic,This looks horrendously boring.
AST2-4db4ic,"this is my favorite book and Greta is one of my favorite writer/director and these are my favorite actor and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it!!! and also cry, I just did it and it's only the trailer"
AST2-4db4ic,I got a bad feeling about this year's oscars
AST2-4db4ic,"I read little women in highschool of 2011, I found the whole 1970 miniseries version o youtube, and really liked it. I was exctatic to watch the 1994 film and I loved Winona, and it was fascinating how starkly different it was from the more bright colorful miniseries. Its funny how its so obvious what era a period drama was released, with the exception of a few."
AST2-4db4ic,emma watson looks more like belle here than in the movie she literally supposedly portrays belle
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm so excited! can‚Äôt wait for thisüòø
AST2-4db4ic,"chills, luv"
AST2-4db4ic,jo rejecting laurie gets a million times heartbreaking like girl thATS TIMOTHEE CHALAMET WHAT IS U DOIN
AST2-4db4ic,Can't wait to see it!!!
AST2-4db4ic,I just saw the episode of Friends in which Joey reads Little Women and Rachel ruins the plot for him. I hope Beth is well at the end :/
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm really not going to be able to handle another adaptation of this where Jo and Laurie don't end up together, especially since it's Saoirse and Timothee IM GOING TO BE EMOTIONALLY WRECKED"
AST2-4db4ic,Wait a goddamn minute.....why not switch all these women out with men????
AST2-4db4ic,What is this music I need to know
AST2-4db4ic,wow I'm excited for this one!
AST2-4db4ic,Timoth√©e Chalamet. Wow.
AST2-4db4ic,sorry im gonna say it but this cast is better than once upon a time in hollywood and all these younger actors will turn into acting legends when they are older
AST2-4db4ic,"This is one of those movies that we didn't need.  The 1994 version with Winona Rider, Christian Bale, Kirsten Dunst, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, etc. was basically the same movie."
AST2-4db4ic,"The movies in the past ended with 








Jo marrying Professor Behr. How are they gonna end this one?"
AST2-4db4ic,Expect feminist propaganda shoved down your throats for 90 mins
AST2-4db4ic,A lovely cast. Now for the adaptation itself
AST2-4db4ic,i cant wait!!!
AST2-4db4ic,Yes please.
AST2-4db4ic,"I mean, Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Timoth√©e Chalamet, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep, Louis Garrel (who i adore) and Tracy Letts. Just wow! Oscars all over. I have never been this excited about a film specially another remake."
AST2-4db4ic,I am an extra in this movie! Pause at 0:35 and look at the teenager on the left wearing red and white! That‚Äôs me!
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm wondering if they read the book or just watched all the adaptations because I can already tell it‚Äôs pretty different.
AST2-4db4ic,"Meryl Streep, Saoirse Ronan and Laura Dern in the same movie? I'M IN !!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Is this an all star actors/actresses? Cuz Damn
AST2-4db4ic,A movie that everyone knows a spoiler to. Thank You F.R.I.E.N.D.S.

AST2-4db4ic,There is no Mr. Bhaer??

AST2-4db4ic,"Yeah, no.
Y'all millennials can have this.

Like I want to like it because I love this book so much....but I dont think it will do it justice. I guess we'll see when it comes out."
AST2-4db4ic,BRO IM TOO EXCITED

AST2-4db4ic,saoirse and timothee pls make more movies together lol
AST2-4db4ic,_Pretty White Kids With Problems: Girls' Edition_
AST2-4db4ic,I looooooovvvve EMMA WATSON.
AST2-4db4ic,This should be trending. The cast is literally incredible.
AST2-4db4ic,timothee and saoirse are young de niro and streep
AST2-4db4ic,"This is the worst trailer I have seen in a long time, it makes it look like a modern day high school love drama that Noah Centineo would be casted in. I highly doubt it will live up to the 1994 version, which was perfectly casted and had an amazing music score by Thomas Newman, which set each scene perfectly"
AST2-4db4ic,All these women look to be full sized... what a rip off.
AST2-4db4ic,Dude
AST2-4db4ic,Soundtrack?
AST2-4db4ic,"Look, I love Emma Watson, but she sounds like Marianne Williamson"
AST2-4db4ic,What is the music??
AST2-4db4ic,"For those saying the 1994 version is better, heed to me for a moment. This is an introduction to a newer generation. Yes, it‚Äôs a film for everyone but, it‚Äôs also a new interpretation! And also, Timothee isn‚Äôt Christian, but Christian isn‚Äôt Timothee either. As they‚Äôre both incredible actors, and you really can‚Äôt compare the two. Or anybody else for that matter!"
AST2-4db4ic,Ok Timothee üôåüèª

cashier  :   the movie isn't even out yet ‚Ä¶."
AST2-4db4ic,So happy Friends showed me that book!
AST2-4db4ic,Timoth√©e Chalamet is a complete miscast. what is lorie suppose to be? 15? He's way too boyish looking for the role. Older Amy looks like she could be his mother.
AST2-4db4ic,IM CRYING ALREADY I  CANT WAIT IM SO EXCITED WOWOWOWOWOWOWO
AST2-4db4ic,and the oscar goes to...SAOIRSE FUCKIN RONAN
AST2-4db4ic,It's missing Winona Ryder.
AST2-4db4ic,"Well, what can I say, Laura Dern is *no* Susan Sarandon, and Timothee Chalamet is *no* young, dapper and dreamy Christian Bale. That being said, if Emma Watson is in it, I'm definitely looking forward to watching this version."
AST2-4db4ic,everyone getting excited about timothee and saoirse have obviously never read the book.
AST2-4db4ic,"Is it just me or am I not super excited by this. I know there are dozens of versions but I absolutely fell in love with the 2017/8 BBC adaptation. Maya Hawke as Jo stole my heart esp, but there was time for all the sisters. Including Beth and Meg who get like one shot each in this trailer. I'm just not sure if I'm gonna be able to fall in love again in the space of a film vs 3 hours spread over several weeks. 
That aside it does have a stellar cast and looks like it may dedicate some time to strengthening Amy's character- who so often gets dismissed as just the pickled limes girl. I do love Jo- obviously- but Amy's worldliness and very different kind of practicality hold a very dear place in my heart too."
AST2-4db4ic,"Production: How many great actors do you need?

Casting Director: Yes"
AST2-4db4ic,Winona Ryder was nominated for Oscar Best Actress in a Leading Role playing Jo in the 1994 adaptation. Judging on this trailer we might just see history repeat itself again with Saoirse Ronan.
AST2-4db4ic,Come on casting let's get sickeniiiiing
AST2-4db4ic,I love this cast!!!! üòç
AST2-4db4ic,greta gerwig thank you for my life
AST2-4db4ic,i'm gonna lose my mind this is everything i need
AST2-4db4ic,so excited DNSNNSNS
AST2-4db4ic,Ok before I Actually see this. I saw the title and remembered that a book called the same was read by Rachel and Joey in friends....and Joey was very upset about something happening...and put the book in the freezer...I'm assuming the movie is on the same book...
AST2-4db4ic,This is gonna be great
AST2-4db4ic,1994 verison is one of my favourite films but I'm interested to this new adaptation.
AST2-4db4ic,I didn‚Äôt know who the cast was before watched this but I instantly thought Meryl Streep has definitely got to be in this
AST2-4db4ic,"I'm so excited to see this, but I just can't believe I know a major spoiler because of Rachel getting mad at Joey in 1997."
AST2-4db4ic,"little and short and white women, ugh how boring.... wasn't this done over and over already, enough with the white women...... it should have diversity to this theme this day and Age. Its like belle has suddenly book friends from the beauty and the beast and she was allowed out to floak and play as a Sistar."
AST2-4db4ic,nope
AST2-4db4ic,"Greta will ruin me with this movie, I'm sure of it (and i will love it üòÇ‚ù§)"
AST2-4db4ic,OMG i can't wait that long üò≠üò≠üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,Probably this will do well with critics but I don't see people watching this on theaters.
AST2-4db4ic,"terrible typefaace, the rest is absolutely perfect"
AST2-4db4ic,"While no one can ever match the veracity of Winona Ryder's performance, I'm excited to see this cast in action! I wonder if I'll end up watching this adaptation throughout the fall/winter season just like I do with the 1994 version? That movie is fall."
AST2-4db4ic,Didn‚Äôt Columbia made this movie already?
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse will finally get her first Oscar here
AST2-4db4ic,Looks boring but I‚Äôll watch for Chalamet
AST2-4db4ic,My favorite book retold again... interesting üòå
AST2-4db4ic,"I don't know, Emma doesn't strike me as the type to play a frilly girly girl convincingly. Emma strikes me more as tomboyish Jo than girly girl Meg IMO."
AST2-4db4ic,Jo is the best sister for sure. It‚Äôs weird that Emma wasn‚Äôt casted for that role...
AST2-4db4ic,"AHHHHH I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!! I LOVE SAOIRSE RONAN!!!
And after seeing Florence in Midsommar, I'm really thrilled to see her in this. What a wonderful cast and director!!! So incredibly excited!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Back on the day when women didn‚Äôt shave ü§£üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
AST2-4db4ic,"Hey I just realized thats ""Vicar Handsome"" from Grantchester 1:32 
Anyone know his real name? I never bothered to remember it, because I just kept calling him ""Vicar Handsome"""
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan and Timoth√©e Chalamet are the best thing that could have ever happened in my life.
AST2-4db4ic,I don't want this
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson still sounds English üíÄ
AST2-4db4ic,*JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!*
AST2-4db4ic,"This looks beautiful but I'm too attached to Winona Ryder as Jo, I can't see anyone else on that role"
AST2-4db4ic,Ah hear another remake come on stop with the remakes PLEASE!!!! Wait till cast members gone then remake something
AST2-4db4ic,TIMMY!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,It pronounced Saoirse not Saoirse you guys!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"Not going to lie, didn't think I would like this when I first heard about it but now, I actually really want to watch it!!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Please kill me now!
AST2-4db4ic,I can't wait! This looks great!!
AST2-4db4ic,"See they have to end together in this adaptation, they‚Äôre too beautiful to break our hearts again. I‚Äôm getting all the feels from the chemistry already"
AST2-4db4ic,I‚Äôm crying this looks so amazing!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma watson mostly select the novel adaptations. But i will watch it. I think she should select more fictional movies with some badass action and aggressive dialogue dilevery. 
What do you guys think?"
AST2-4db4ic,Yesssss‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,How many times will they remake this movieee
AST2-4db4ic,oh my this cast!!!! the name should be Big Women instead
AST2-4db4ic,Is it just me or is this not HD at all?
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse and Timoth√©e.. oh my. I think I might die because of my heart being so full..
AST2-4db4ic,So you mean that if a watch the movie Beth will die?????
AST2-4db4ic,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
AST2-4db4ic,"i wanted to hate this, but i cant, i love little women, the movie versions i love are katherine hepburn and little women 1994"
AST2-4db4ic,Love everything about it
AST2-4db4ic,"For anyone who cares, the background songs are spliced from ‚ÄúWasting Time‚Äù by Katie Herzig and ‚ÄúFinder‚Äù by Cyrus Reynolds"
AST2-4db4ic,Another hit. Can't wait for Greta to direct the live-action Barbie starring Margot Robbie üíñ
AST2-4db4ic,"She just went through this beautiful, inspiring speech about how it doesn‚Äôt matter if women get married and here I am hoping they change the end and let her end up with Laurie üòÇüò≥üòä"
AST2-4db4ic,Is this the novel that joey and rachel read ? (From friends)
AST2-4db4ic,I love u Emma üíìüíìüíìüíì... Huge fanüíòüíò
AST2-4db4ic,I literally cant wait for this to come out
AST2-4db4ic,louis garrel ?? bob odenkirk?? xD
AST2-4db4ic,Im watching this because of the cast!
AST2-4db4ic,well you know where I‚Äôll be Christmas Day
AST2-4db4ic,Las lime√±as jam√°s ser√°n europeas jajajaja
AST2-4db4ic,Joey wouldn‚Äôt be confused by the story if he sees the movie.
AST2-4db4ic,I feel like Joey Tribbiani spoiled this movie for me 20 years ago
AST2-4db4ic,"Something's off about this.  It looks like the 19th century, but it feels so modern."
AST2-4db4ic,Come on Saoirse..How many times are u gonna make me fall in love with u..Enough already..üòÖüòò
AST2-4db4ic,They're all actresses who are 10 years or more older than their characters so that's interesting. Emma Watson can't even completely cover up het British accent lol. And could there be a more cliched movie to do? I'll bet this gives Meryl Streep another Oscar nod lol
AST2-4db4ic,wow I thought it would take longer the trailer
AST2-4db4ic,You have got to be kidding me!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been waiting for ages for this trailer. I‚Äôm so freaking excited!!!!!!  Greta Gerwig I love you and thank you. Omgomgofmgigifoushfbfbicjf
AST2-4db4ic,Let the shipping begin!!
AST2-4db4ic,Looks like I‚Äôll be getting dragged to the theater for this one.
AST2-4db4ic,"I remember reading the book as a kid and it became an inspiration for me to learn that being a woman brings more purpose than just getting married. My favorite character(s) is, of course, Jo and Meg. Thank you for making a movie based on this amazing novel, and YES finally I can't wait for the movie to be released!! <3 <3    
P.S: I too read Anna of Green Gables, another inspirational book about women <3"
AST2-4db4ic,certainly does look like a show for women
AST2-4db4ic,Which pixel is the movie?
AST2-4db4ic,Emma's American accent leaves a lot to be desired.
AST2-4db4ic,The origin of the cat lady.
AST2-4db4ic,Who else watched the animated series ?
AST2-4db4ic,TIMOTH√âE LOOKS STUNNING
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee is incredible!!
AST2-4db4ic,But why? Winona was perfect ‚ô•
AST2-4db4ic,"alright youtube community, who's found the music for this???"
AST2-4db4ic,SO EXCITEDüò≠
AST2-4db4ic,What exactly is he saying around 1:40?  It'd be a perfect what?
AST2-4db4ic,Emma and Saoirseüòç
AST2-4db4ic,"Is there a Professor Baher in this one? Or can we just do away with that whole thing, it always felt like a betrayal of Jo‚Äôs character"
AST2-4db4ic,So happy Emma was abused üòçüòçüòçüòç
AST2-4db4ic,I hated lady bird hope this is better
AST2-4db4ic,why so much white people???
AST2-4db4ic,"Oscars 2020, anyone?"
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan is going to receive a bunch of nominations for this! I really hope so!
AST2-4db4ic,I love Emma Watson since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
AST2-4db4ic,This looks like the edgy Little Women. Like how Anne is the edgy Anne of Green Gables
AST2-4db4ic,The chemistry between Saoirse Ronan and Timoth√©e Chalamet is amazing. They are so pure and natural while playing together...
AST2-4db4ic,"It's been hundred of years, nay thousands, and still, we are still fighting to be more than our love interests."
AST2-4db4ic,"I like that they showed a clip of Emma Watson at 1:58 when the word ""beauty"" was said. I see what you did there üòè"
AST2-4db4ic,"I can't say from how long I was waiting for the trailer, I have watched every film adaptation of the book. And also read it more than 20 times."
AST2-4db4ic,"I guess there are no useful young American actors anymore, that Hollywood has to use Irish and British actors to play Americans... (sarcasm)"
AST2-4db4ic,It gave me such a vintage classic feel
AST2-4db4ic,I want to... NO! I NEED to see this right now.
AST2-4db4ic,"What a great cast. All i can say is ""OSCARS JUST WAIT AND RELAX COZ WE ARE GONNA TAKE IT BABY""."
AST2-4db4ic,Greta Gerwig gonna get the mainstream acclaim Sofia Coppola should've had.
AST2-4db4ic,"Are Saoirse Ronan and Emma Watson (almost 30 years old)
Playing teenagers???? üòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,Um...why?
AST2-4db4ic,In Greta Gerwig we trust. Amen.
AST2-4db4ic,Interesting
AST2-4db4ic,"getting tired of Hollywood's inability to write original movies


but Timothee is in it so I guess I'll see it."
AST2-4db4ic,Anyone know the music they‚Äôre using here?
AST2-4db4ic,¬°Al fin!
AST2-4db4ic,Just saying ....doesn't anyone in Hollywood write anymore ??
AST2-4db4ic,That's a hell of a collaboration... What??! üò≤
AST2-4db4ic,this story and this film matter so much to me and thank you to greta gerwig for giving us this
AST2-4db4ic,muaddddd'dibbbbbb
AST2-4db4ic,"This was my 5th grade novel
And the movie is the last thing I expected"
AST2-4db4ic,I remember reading this book while younger. I'm going to enjoy this I think. I hope there's the Jo cutting her hair scene.
AST2-4db4ic,"Great Gerwig: Hmm. A Little Women adaptation. 

She ignites the Saorise Ronan signal. 

Noah Baumbach: Greta, when did you put this spotlight on are roof. 

Greta: You have the Ben Stiller signal for your movies. 

Noah: Your right."
AST2-4db4ic,tell me why i thought it was jennette mccurdy from icarly standing next to emma watson on the video cover
AST2-4db4ic,Is it me or someone else is in the comments to see who put the name of the last song? hahaha i freakin love it üòç üôåüèºüî• Anyone know the name? üôèüèªüò™
AST2-4db4ic,Yes! Chalamet is here again!! It would be amazing
AST2-4db4ic,This made my heart soar
AST2-4db4ic,Saoirse Ronan better win oscar this time.She has done so much already
AST2-4db4ic,yessss!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"When are they going to stop making films about women saying and whinging that they are something more and great and actually demonstrate and show that they are something more and great without all the whinging and anxiety? I think the Bechdel Test needs an update to include that women whinging and being anxiety ridden? Or better yet make a film where a man and a woman are the leads and they talk and go through everything except romantic relationships and sexual desire. Some might say that these two scenarios will make a boring film, and maybe they are right, but I live in hope."
AST2-4db4ic,I prefer Emma Watson as Jo
AST2-4db4ic,Hope it will bring oscar to sairose
AST2-4db4ic,It seems like just yesterday when I saw the breakout performances of Florence Pugh & Eliza Scanlen. Such a big movie already!
AST2-4db4ic,Why not much screen Space for emma
AST2-4db4ic,"I always love Jo and Laurie duo but now I'm completely a mess, they so perfect. Love the book. Love the story. Love the 94 adaptation. I can't wait to see what Greta did cause she is the best ‚ù§"
AST2-4db4ic,I AM IMPRESSED
AST2-4db4ic,"Whoever decided to put Timoth√©e chalamet, Emma Watson and Meryl Streep in a film together is a genuis"
AST2-4db4ic,I hope Emma Watson is playing an English person......?  because she didn't sound American at all.
AST2-4db4ic,Am i the only one who still thinks winona ryder and christian bale one was adapted perfectly
AST2-4db4ic,om....... so excited!

AST2-4db4ic,"'These little women, wow.' - Joey Tribbiani"
AST2-4db4ic,so Saoirse Ronan okay amazing i cant wait and all the cast to hands down
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised, this looks better than I expected. I was worried they‚Äôd make it too modern. In the book Jo is very dismissive of women and femininity, so I‚Äôm glad Meg is given that line about her choice being just as valid. I also have hopes they‚Äôll do Amy justice, she was my favorite."
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee  Chalamet ‚ù§üòò
AST2-4db4ic,I CAN'T WAIT AAAFSGWHWJJWKAKAOW

AST2-4db4ic,Who came from timothee‚Äôs Instagram story??
AST2-4db4ic,"Can this finally be the last remake of this? This thing has been covered more than ""Yesterday"" by the Beatles. Surely other material centered around women exists that could be made into a movie or TV show, right? This can't be the ONLY thing?"
AST2-4db4ic,You lost me at pascal pictures
AST2-4db4ic,I am so excited for this movie!! I love the previous adaptations but this is the reason why movies and stories get remade and retold. Classic stories with classic messages that new generations get to experience for the first time and for the previous generations to rediscover with a new perspective ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

AST2-4db4ic,It looks like another Oscar nom for Saoirse Ronan.
AST2-4db4ic,I love Saoirse Ronan  so much!
AST2-4db4ic,I hope Eliza Scalen gets her chance to shine amongst this incredible cast. She was amazing in Sharp Objects.
AST2-4db4ic,This trailer put a smile on my face.

AST2-4db4ic,To every single person who dislikes this trailer; I hope you learn how to actually love and have fun.

AST2-4db4ic,Who is playing professor ?
AST2-4db4ic,Before 50k views
AST2-4db4ic,"Doesn't look much like the book I read.  The characters are supposed to be 12 to 16 when it begins and none of those actresses look anything near their teenage years.  Nor does the content seem to match the book.  Yeah, I like my movies that claim they are ""based"" on this or that to actually closely portray what they are trying to ""base"" their movie on.  But maybe this is the best book adaptation of Little Women out there?"
AST2-4db4ic,Cast ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Little Women needed an update and this looks as though it‚Äôs captured some of the joy from the novel. Looking forward to seeing it!

AST2-4db4ic,THIS CAST IS PERFECT
AST2-4db4ic,Emma ‚ô•Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Florence :')
AST2-4db4ic,Sony is slowly becoming the new Fox. They're producing midrange budgeted original high concept director-driven movies.
AST2-4db4ic,I love Greta Gerwig
AST2-4db4ic,"Wow, that casting, that energy, that witty and emotional tone.
WOW!"
AST2-4db4ic,emmaaaaaa

AST2-4db4ic,Whats Timmy and Saoirse ship called? because i want in
AST2-4db4ic,I am so looking forward to this movie! (Even though I already know that I won't like the end)
AST2-4db4ic,CHILLS!!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
AST2-4db4ic,All the time I was watching the trailer the thought that Joey could not complete the book kept coming around.
AST2-4db4ic,"Meryl, Saoirse, Emma my fav ladies in one farm finally ü§ó"
AST2-4db4ic,"Seriously, did we really need yet another version of this movie?"
AST2-4db4ic,I will not watch if Emma Watson doesn't look in lead of movie
AST2-4db4ic,Something worth watching üòç
AST2-4db4ic,This shud be love about lesbians
AST2-4db4ic,Dude!!!! I freakin love it!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"I watched the BBC version (the one Maya Hawke)... Waste of 3 hours of my life! Don't think I'll be watching this either, this story has been done to the death with all the adaptations..."
AST2-4db4ic,I wonder how many talented actresses auditioned for these roles but didn't get it
AST2-4db4ic,Winona forever !!!
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WATSON... agggg SHE IS BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
AST2-4db4ic,I thought Emma is in lead but instead sairose is in the lead actress (p.s. I am not complaining
AST2-4db4ic,Give them the Oscars now if you want
AST2-4db4ic,This looks so cozy to watch on Christmas
AST2-4db4ic,Oscar is coming!!!
AST2-4db4ic,This trailer is very generic. It makes it look like a romcom that we all know about. From being directed by Greta I thought it was going to have it' s own tempo and way of storytelling but um have I seen this every other afternoon at Freeform?
AST2-4db4ic,This is exactly what I want
AST2-4db4ic,Wow didn't expect this to be Tarantinos 10th last movie
AST2-4db4ic,"Little Women is one of the greatest novels of all time, I feel like a movie can never replicate that."
AST2-4db4ic,"One of my most anticipated of the year, this looks excellent."
AST2-4db4ic,Emma Watson is totally miscast as Meg.  And Louis Garrel as Friedrich Bhae?  No way!  The 1994 movie was just such a great adaptation....
AST2-4db4ic,Hot steaming garbage.
AST2-4db4ic,Omg it looks fantastic! THIS CAST I cannot even!!
AST2-4db4ic,qwhite interesting movie
AST2-4db4ic,This is dumb. All these chicks look normal size to me... üòè
AST2-4db4ic,This cast PLEASEEEEE
AST2-4db4ic,Polanski and Harvey out of the picture and finally Meryl gets the pudding and sits on the iron casting couch throne.  DAAAAdAAAAA deee deee daaa daa DEE DEE DAAA DAAA DADADA AAAA
AST2-4db4ic,this is gonna be such an incredible movie wow
AST2-4db4ic,"Now, these little women. How little are they? I mean, are they like, scary little??? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,"I can‚Äôt imagine coming close to the 1994 version with Winona Ryder, but still excited to see this version. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
AST2-4db4ic,"Non! Not to be confused with the Lifetime 'Little Women' :)
Judging on the casts and director it's gonna be a blast. Can't wait to see this adaptation!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Beautiful, lush, rich, detailed.....this looks like a 80's or 90's film in detail......outstanding!"
AST2-4db4ic,"Emma Watson really cannot do an American Accent, let‚Äôs face it."
AST2-4db4ic,EMMA WATSONüòªüòªüòªüòªüñ§
AST2-4db4ic,"Wasn‚Äôt really watching the trailer, was just thinking about that time in Friends when they spoil the book for Joey üòÇ"
AST2-4db4ic,"If I was already exited, now I‚Äôm dying to see it!"
AST2-4db4ic,W.O.W
AST2-4db4ic,Joey must be sooo happy!
AST2-4db4ic,This looks like a low budget Netflix  period piece for teenagers. Just watch the studio bribe its way into the awards season.
AST2-4db4ic,I smell Oscar bait
AST2-4db4ic,This. Looks. Magical.
AST2-4db4ic,I love the one with Winona Ryder and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm gonna love this one too! Can‚Äôt wait üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,Oh Lord this is gonna be something!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,This is the EIGHTH film adaptation of this story. ENOUGH ALREADY
AST2-4db4ic,Joey & Rachel from Friends basically spoiled the ending for me...
AST2-4db4ic,and saorise and timmy together once again at the hands of greta gerwig... ITS ALL TOO MUCH
AST2-4db4ic,"Lots of talented women here and I'm an admirer of Greta Gerwig's works so this one I look forward to.

But excuse my bitterness because I'm disappointed Emma Watson had to replace Emma Stone -- The latter Emma is simply the superior actress!"
AST2-4db4ic,"they are going to have to work really hard to beat the 90's version with Susan Sarandon, Wynona Rider, Claire Danes and Christian Bale etc. That version was perfect."
AST2-4db4ic,Weren't they British?
AST2-4db4ic,every single second of this trailer was a work of art and i don't know how to handle it
AST2-4db4ic,this casting cannot be any better! i‚Äôm really looking forward to this movie ü§û‚ù§Ô∏è
AST2-4db4ic,ahhhh love love love love love
AST2-4db4ic,Another Whole movie in a Trailer! Thanks for saving people money Sony. Hint....less is more!

AST2-4db4ic,I heart just skipped a beat Little women is one of my fave books and Timothee playing Laurie will be the death of me.
AST2-4db4ic,We want NEW Harry Potter!
AST2-4db4ic,Wow that is so cool üòç

AST2-4db4ic,I like the 1994 version from Columbia Pictures.
AST2-4db4ic,"I love the novel, can't wait to see it with such a spectacular cast."
AST2-4db4ic,"Wow, they have some firepower of actors in this film! *Boom Boom*"
AST2-4db4ic,An all white cast how convenient
AST2-4db4ic,This looks amazing!!!!!
AST2-4db4ic,"911? Yes, I'd like to report a theft. Timothee Chalamet is stealing my heart in this trailer."
AST2-4db4ic,Meh
AST2-4db4ic,"Beautiful cast and filmed in the most spectacular way, it's thrilling. I cannot wait to watch their bonding. 'Women.. they have minds, heart and soul.' 
'Little women' is a gem of Literature. üíú"
AST2-4db4ic,1:50 oh yeah now we are changing the reall story üòí
AST2-4db4ic,OMG EMMA AND SAOIRSE IN ONE MOVIE YES I‚ÄôM SO EXCITED üòç
AST2-4db4ic,"As soon as I'm all tapped out of white guilt, Hollywood starts pumping out movies to extract my male guilt. 
I'm getting dangerously low on resources."
AST2-4db4ic,I'm a '90s kid; I just miss Winona and Christian.
AST2-4db4ic,Make JO GAYYYYYY
AST2-4db4ic,Ronan better get that Oscar!
AST2-4db4ic,‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

AST2-4db4ic,Finally a movie on women empowerment that touches the heart softly
AST2-4db4ic,Finally Emma Watson is Back!üòç
AST2-4db4ic,I don't care if it's a remake. I'm in with these women. And the cast is insane ü§òü§òü§òüòçüòçüòç
AST2-4db4ic,"Wow.. Timoth√®e has all my attention...
This movie has peaked my interest to the next level..."
AST2-4db4ic,Big little lies meets Lady bird. lol
AST2-4db4ic,I just came here for Florence Pugh
AST2-4db4ic,what about louis garrel in film too?)
AST2-4db4ic,"Big little lies, lady bird, call me by your name, sharp object, etc all coming together in one movie. I‚Äôm fucking here for it!!"
AST2-4db4ic,Timothee is exactly how I always pictured Laurie.
AST2-4db4ic,Beth die
AST2-4db4ic,"I‚Äôll be honest, I was like ‚Äúreally why do they need to remake it?‚Äù but once I saw Chalamet, I knew."
AST2-4db4ic,"Bradley Cooper: I'm gonna make a remake of a remake of a remake of a remake.

Greta Gerwig: Hold my beer. I'm making a Little Women movie."
AST2-4db4ic,This looks dope!

AST2-4db4ic,"Looks great, I only hope that the music won't be so modern"

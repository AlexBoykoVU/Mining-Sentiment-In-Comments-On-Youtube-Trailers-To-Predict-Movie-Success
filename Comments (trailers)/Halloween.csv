ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this out rn
ek1ePFp-nBI,Has anybody watched this movie online for free and if so can you please tell me the links/sites!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie Lee Curtis character died in Halloween Resurrection 2002.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah Danny McBride looks like he can direct a movie!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Idk why that was so funny to me üò≠üò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:45 Pingu?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, so fucking throw out the other movies and just connect the very first movie to this movie? So was he arrested after his first killings?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just Saw it.... it was very good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Talk about squeezing the orange dry, fuck me man"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Imagine how annoyed he had to have been *‚Äúwhy does this bitch keep trying to close the door it obviously won‚Äôt close wtf why do you do this I‚Äôm trying to make a dramatic entrance but Jesus your so annoying IÔ∏è want to bust out and stab you right now lord Christ‚Äù*
ek1ePFp-nBI,whose excited?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this a reboot a sequel or a prequel? It‚Äôs confusing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In the original movie he was shot but he wasn‚Äôt taken into custody, he escaped"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What doesn't make sense is, how she wants him to escape, so she can kill him. If he got captured and never escaped, put the evening behind you. Probably going to be another bad sequel, should have just killed him off in the first movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie Strode was killed off in Ressurection (finally) and I thought her daughter Jamie died in 1995? Is this Jamie Strodes daughter?  And  where is Laurie Strodes son?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:20 nice detail, they even have the needle hole in his neck from the first film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing!! I'm seeing it tonight! Can't wait!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,just got tickets for Saturday...fuck yeah

ek1ePFp-nBI,Check out this fast crazy short Sci Fi Horror Film Called K Cell done by Line A Roach Films https://youtu.be/xioKZoCXees
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween was a great horror film till the end now it's starting to get silly just like Friday the 13th
ek1ePFp-nBI,That Death by Daylight soundtrack
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Also the 10k dislikes are actually

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yay I luv Michael myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait why is it bo zombies soundtrack
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't look so scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm going to watch it so excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lmao ""excuse me, somebodys in here"" I don't think he care if the stall is fricking occupied"
ek1ePFp-nBI,watching this on the toilet just in case i poop my pants
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maximum prisones , shouldn t have a bus school for transferring the people"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Weird that buses don t crush everyday ,but even when crashes Michael focking meyer is in it wtfff"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yet another argument for the death penalty
ek1ePFp-nBI,that old lady character  is stupid . stop trying to push things just to meet a hidden quota.  why does every movie have to have a strong independant woman typa thing nowadays ? .im sure the movie will turn out decent but if she  knows what hes capabile of then idk why shes using guns and acting all macho it gives the movie a action movie vibe .if you want to make an original story just make a new one with a new villian and characters   dont change a classic. damn dood the hype is gone for me :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn son where‚Äôd you find this

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wish they would‚Äôve followed the storyline of the first two instead of just the first one but it‚Äôs still great
ek1ePFp-nBI,they should have made jaime lee curtis's character a male.maybe people would understand why some people was upset with ghostbusters. i could care less though
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gilaaaaa ini sih seruuu bangett
ek1ePFp-nBI,He got gen rushed af

ek1ePFp-nBI,im going to ssee this sooon
ek1ePFp-nBI,When you are thinking of the best and look its already been written!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is only taking the first Halloween movie into account? Plus changing the ending of that one saying he got caught???
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the Halloween franchise i wanna see this one. my only problem is that it totally disregards all the sequels that followed from Halloween 2 all the way to the resurrection.we all knew Laurie Strode to be Michael Myers baby sister. in this one they're saying now she's not his sister why change the storyline after all these years?.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone on tumblr pointed out that Michael Myers looks like Mariah Carey and now I can't get that thought out of my mind.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yassss he is back! If he dies I will cry
ek1ePFp-nBI,spooky boooooo!

ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm gonna have nightmares after watching this one. BUT I do need to go see it. It's a MUST...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have the feeling that Rob Zombie's Halloween is more hardcore than this one. Let's see !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought the old lady was killed already when she fell of the roof, how tf is she alive"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't help but to root for Michael lol sorry

ek1ePFp-nBI,so what's the deal with him? why won't he die after being shot loads of times???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee looks terrible......................?????????????
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like the 2007 movie better because it has the realism in how Michel would act and I miss the giantism in him it suits him well especially that cene where he made those masks its really his style! Welp I guess I had my hopes up for this movie for nothing. Im not saying the movie will be bad, just saying that most 2018 horror movie recreations of other old horror movies they don't really get in there with the horror sometimes and it kinda bothers me.



          Welp, that is all for my opinion on this movie and all that im comparing it to the other old movie, bye!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,JLC is showing some heavy wear.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am seeing this the minute it comes out

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like I won't be sleeping for a week but who need sleep?Am I right
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why Is Jamie Lee wearing a mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another question how is his sister still alive he found her and killed her on the roof top?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look another Halloween movie I can tell you what happens some people die they can't find him then they find him they think they kill him but he lives and that's the end of the movie

ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween: muh strong womanz
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANNOT wait to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It feels a bit unbelievable Michael was 21 when he killed Laurie‚Äôs friends and this movie is supposed to play out 40 years later which means that he is still killing at the age of 61
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs the same guy in John Wick and he still have not lernd a lesson

ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm really hoping the revolver laurie is using in the streets in the trailer is the same revolver dr lumis used in the first Halloween it would be a fantastic call back and would have dr lumis there in spirit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Only 2 days leeeft can't waiiiit

ek1ePFp-nBI,"The man, the only
Michael Myers is back children"
ek1ePFp-nBI,F*** i want to see this movie so bad
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit I am so seeing this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To the people wondering why he's coming back. Its because of his own reasons. He chose her at random in the first film,for whatever his reasons where. He's driven by his own reasons. He's not like you and me,its somewhat like no country for old men's,Anton. They are psychopaths and are lacking anything human. Most notably empathy. Dr Loomis knew this and knew how dangerous he was. He waited all those years silently to escape to kill  again. This being a direct sequel to 1 they never where kin. Which honestly makes it more creepy. Just remember,there is no reasoning or truly understanding him,he's just evil..cold and calculated,he's waited 40 years to finish it. And that's pretty much it,there's not always a rhyme or a reason in life... And that's what made the first one so great."
ek1ePFp-nBI,QUEM VAI ASSISTIR O FILME NO CINEMA???
ek1ePFp-nBI,It like a killer in the dead by daylight

- Classic Continuity: Halloween 1, 2 and 4-6
- Halloween III: Season Of The Witch.
- H20 Continuity: 20 Years Later and Ressurection. This disregards everything after 2.
- Rob Zombie Continuity: Halloween 2007 and Halloween II (2009)
- 2018 Continuity, which disregards everything after the first film.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this movie even scary? (Just asking them who actually have watchin' this movie)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here's what I'm loving about this movie so far.  It addresses the myth that Michael and Laurie are siblings.  That was never established in the original movie, it was established in the second movie and John Carpenter himself said that he was pressured into making it so.  In the original movie, Laurie was just some random girl that Michel stalked.  Glad to see them returning to the original concept of the characters."
ek1ePFp-nBI,he looks so cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,FSK?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,AFRAIDüò±

(you'll need to catch it)... Stop & Pause it right before he bangs his face/head on restroom door. They got a little wimp with ketchup on his face playing Michael Myers shit with all the money they have to make this movie you'd think they'd have someone that looked like the past unmasked Michael Myers, did they think we wouldn't pause and look at it frame by frame.

ek1ePFp-nBI,How can Jamie lee curtis be alive again didnt she die in h20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think they should wait until the 25th top release it in the U.S. So it would be exactly 40 years since the original was released.
ek1ePFp-nBI,A setting in which Michael cannot get pallet looped.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I Just Now Watched The *Very First* Halloween Movie.
And It Was Honestly More Scary Than I Thought And It Makes Me Even More Excited About This Final Stand Between Michael Myers and Laurie!
I'm Just So Happy That They Always Stuck To The *ORIGINAL* Laurie, (except for the remakes) And That The Original Actress Came Back For *One. Last. Battle.*
Gosh I'm excited :))"
ek1ePFp-nBI,10k god botherers disliked
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like garbage. Why would they move such a dangerous guy on a bus instead of an armoured truck with escort? These types of films are always so poorly written.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer reveals too much
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""I've waited for him."" LOL But you died in Resurrection! You sure you aren't related to him? You keep coming back as many times as he does! I love the Halloween series and actually grew up with it but this shit is getting old. Will one of your characters die and stay dead? We don't see Nancy Thompson coming back from the grave to kill off Freddy for a third, fourth, fifth time. New Nightmare doesn't count. Heather was playing ""Heather"". Yeah, yeah complain about my comment all you want but you know it's true."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where is Ash Vlogs?ü§î

ek1ePFp-nBI,Fun fact: Michael Myers mask is actually a mask of William Shatner painted white.
ek1ePFp-nBI,He'll ya!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's confusing when at least three of the movies in this series are called Halloween.  No subtitle, no number, just Halloween."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was i the only 1 that was bumpin when the music picked up?ü§£üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:23 is no one gonna talk about how Laurie and Michael were practically having a knife fight?

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this going to be the last Halloween because its will be going in circles just him trying to kill his sister?
Also how do they have his old psychiatrist I thought Michael Myer had killed him by choking him? Well I better to go binge watch all the Halloween movies
Also what happened to his niece that had turned into a killer because she touched Michael's hand/ wrist?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No joke, I have already seen the movie and it‚Äôs just Michael finessing everybody"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love Michael Myers character. I love how scary it is. Personally I think someone that's calm and stalkish  is scarier than an axe murderer. We should employ him to hunt child predators. I personally relish the idea of killing people that have done wrong to someone else on that level , such as rape , murder, child molestation , etc. It makes me feel good to watch some people suffer who deserve it. Makes my day. I feel like a kid in a candy store almost haha"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to watch this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,5 DAYS BOYS I CANT WAIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only thing that can make this movie better. Is if when Michael small he is like y'all don't love me y'all love the boys u with. It will make the movie have a purpose... Every horror movie does but not this shit

ek1ePFp-nBI,How is Jamie Lee Curtis in this movie and she died and H2O?
ek1ePFp-nBI,What I Wanna Know the film  Halloween H20 -twenty years later Jamie Lee Curtis beheads Michael right at the end so I want to know why they are doing another Halloween if Michael wasn't beheaded on that particular film I like halloween but I prefer Jason much better I would like to see Jason vs Michael would be quite interesting

ek1ePFp-nBI,From What I know about the Halloween movies (and I know very little and am open to facts about the movie(s) from people who've seen them) is they're SLASHERS/THRILLERS not gun-ho action shmups. So I sincerely hope with every fiber of my being that this movie sucks
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see Michael and Jason in the movies together.  What y'all think?

Saw the 1978 version recently - did anyone notice an ""Easter Egg"" left behind in the show by the director perhaps - it shows a ""surreal connection"" to the Annabelle horror movies now ? 

The easter egg was in a scene in the Halloween 1978 movie where Jamie Lee Curtis ( the Awesome heroine ) was in her room during the day after school ended - on a cabinet in her room, with a poster hanging near the cabinet - there was the ""easter egg""... 

I was so thrilled to see it - John Carpenter's genius to put it there and lay the somewhat ""surreal connection"" to present day Horror mainstay involving the Warrens... Amazing... 

Halloween 2018 is going to be BIG... well done to the team..."

Oh he didn't die? Obviously he returns in every movie but that would make you assume in this movie universe he isn't human. Some kind of hell bent creature or soul in a body trying to get revenge.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So.‚Ä¶..in a way this is a remake of the original Halloween 2 (1981) which ignores all the sequels and starts fresh.

 it's also in a way a remake of Halloween 4 // the return of Michael myers as it's take years years after part 1 as also Halloween 4 takes place years after part 2 with Michael in a coma.


 And it's also a remake of H20 , Halloween 7 // 20 YEARS LATER (1998) as also that takes place 20 years after first film following the events of part 2 (1981) while this new remake takes place 40 years after first movie following the events of part 1.

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like a good movie i love michel Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,The part that scared me is when the boy said can you close the closet door I jumped
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ignoring Halloweens 3 - Resurrection makes total sense. Ignoring the awful Rob Zombie reboot makes total sense. Ignoring Halloween II (1981) makes no sense to me whatsoever. In that scenario where they are not related and she has seen him kill about 3/4 people..which while definitely would be traumatic, but not 40 years of gun training and secret panic room under your kitchen traumatic. If they are not related why would either of them care after 40 years? Now, if you DON'T ignore Halloween II (1981), They ARE related so there's a reason MM still needs to finish her off at 60 years old. Plus she witnessed him get shot multiple times and get blown up in a fire. So that would explain the panic room and militant training."

ek1ePFp-nBI,What is it rated UK
ek1ePFp-nBI,This should be a video game
ek1ePFp-nBI,um i played too much dead by daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Saw it on Friday. Incredible. 10/10. And I am usually someone that is very hard to please, especially with horror movies, but this was so good. It was a like a remake of the original and a sequel in one. It looks great and the music sounds great. We are reminded that Michael is just a man, but he is an absolute brutal killer in this. Some welcome humour added too, but there's no laughing when Michael is in action. I actually hoped the movie would be an hour longer: it felt too short at the end, I wanted more! Best cinema experience in years."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This ain't scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,His alot skinnier and shorter. Uncut was the best in my opinion

ek1ePFp-nBI,"While original performer Nick Castle will play Michael Myers for a couple of scenes in Halloween 2018, actor James Jude Courtney played the role for the majority of filming."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, Halloween 4 ignored Halloween 3, to become a direct sequel to Halloweens 1 and 2, which originally could be considered a single long movie. Halloween: H20 ignored Halloweens 5 and 6, to become a direct sequel to Halloween 4. And now we ignore Halloweens 2 through 10, and treat Halloween eleven as the new Halloween two. Everyone got that? Simple!  In this version, some events that occurred in Halloween 2 never happened, and others happened, but occurred off-camera in this universe. For example: We're ignoring the part of Halloween 2 where Jamie Lee Curtis turns out to be Michael Myser's kid sister, but not the part where Donald Pleasence shoots him. Basically, Ignore Halloweens three, five and six, then go back and also ignore Halloweens 2 to 10, while keeping some events from Halloween 2 as offscreen events. How can anyone not get something so simple?"

If you hear a sound in the basement, attic, anywhere, just gather a huge group of about 20 buddies with ak-47's and then check out the sound, or, if you don't have friends, just grab a Molotov and toss it into where you heard the sound, if you can not access any of these.... just flat out run to your neighbors house so they'll die. And then you run away."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't get the hype to the Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street series. Ok they are a little before my time but none of them are scary, and its not that I don't appreciate the era they were released in because I play old school video games and can admit how good some are for their era. These films are just corny as all hell and I watch them as kind of a right of passage, I like horror and these are considered the old school greats but I can't for the life of me see why. The only one I sort of get is nightmare on elm street because of the whole dream idea but its not scary enough to frighten a whole generation. I personally think the scares and storylines create much more tense viewing in things like the first 2 insidious films, or SAW 1 (the only good one). I am not saying they are bad films just that I really don't see how they are considered great hour movies by many even for their era is there something I am missing?"

I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.‚Äù"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"What timeline is this movie following, didn't Michael kill Laurie in the Halloween Resurrection"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:59 better actually be like that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I could look at it two ways, one-- its another scary movie with Jaime Lee Curtis that may or may not be good. Two--Going to the big screen and having a chance to remember in October of 1978, that terrified feeling of trying to watch this John Carpenter Horror movie with my GF trying to occupy the same seat I was sitting in. I should Hate this franchise because what Jaws did to swimming, Halloween did to ""Going Parking"".   I speculate they threw a boat load of money at Jaime Lee to do this one.  I hope it ties well to the 1st one but in the end, after 40 years of watching JLC on the big screen, I think she deserves my 20 Bucks."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"While I will certainly see the film, according to a number of reviews there seems to be some minor problems with it that could easily have been fixed in the script stage.  
The writers retconned all the prior sequels out of existence, yet apparently kept making references to them.  This is a problem if it screws with the tone of the film.  If fans accept the decision to retcon the other sequels out, there was no need to waste any film time referring to them.  It's counterproductive.  
The film appears to have enough strengths to overcome this, but it sounds like it could have been even better.  The old eyebrow rose when I read they had to reshoot...the ending..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What‚Äôs with movies using Teenagers
ek1ePFp-nBI,What Laurie said 2:05?

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here we go again. Curtis cut his head off in the last movie. Now we‚Äôre supposed to believe she‚Äôs at it again. We‚Äôre supposed to disbelieve all the other movies happened, and now she gets another go at him again in her 60‚Äôs. ‚ÄúGranny Halloween‚Äù they should call it. Zombie took it beyond. The monster was believable. He was huge, angry, mean, fast moving at times ‚Äî  a true unstoppable, evil force to be reckoned with. His killing sounds and vicious, bone - crunching attacks were palpable. It was Halloween on steroids. Even the blonde kid was creepy. Now we‚Äôre back to the little guy again who‚Äôs no bigger than the average man, and hardly bigger than the average woman, who‚Äôs going to beat everyone up and kill all those whose path he crosses. Bullshit! It‚Äôs pure exploitation. Carpenter knew Zombie made a more terrifying film, but instead of learning from it he followed in his old stubborn ways and calculated that with Curtis‚Äôs big name in there again and his reputation the retro storyline would be welcomed again. And you know what? He‚Äôs probably right. It‚Äôs like going back to the 1940‚Äôs version of King Kong or the Wolfman. They may be classics, but that‚Äôs where they should stay. I‚Äôm not going to pay money to see it, or buy the DVD. Only by hitting them in pocketbook will they know. Hope everyone enjoys seeing the little guy get  killed again."

So these fuckers didn't see their own movie? he fucking kills everyone even if they are not his family. Same fucking concept, now he's even less scary cuz he only wants to kill Laurie.

ek1ePFp-nBI,NOT!!!! being related! I don't like that if there's no explanation then it feels pointless to watch! I liked them being related! & more of a motive personally my favourite is the 4-6 Timeline at least it explained Michael's Powers & of course Donald Pleasance he's a Huge!! part of the Franchise originally I did like the H20 Timeline more until I saw the cancerous Ressurection which completely ruined it now! I'm afraid! making Halloween 2 1981 non canon will ruinüò¢everything although Carpenter did! say Michael  would die for good so there'd be no more sequels it sounds like Michael's Powers are much! weaker hereüò¢& all Michael is known for in this tedious Timeline are 4 murders his sister & Laurie s friends the town not even in Fear! & Lauries scar is barely noticeable also at the End! of the 1st Michael Disappeared! how did they even catch him then Huh!üò¢I don't have a good feeling about this

ek1ePFp-nBI,"It would have been best if they had just left the original alone, no sequels of any kind.¬† I don't care if this does have Jamie Lee Curtis in it, it's going to be s**t.¬† He was shot six times at the end of the original movie.¬† Either he's unstoppable or he's not.¬† If this movie is going to set up that he vulnerable enough to have been captured, but that six bullets didn't kill him, it's ridiculous.¬† Also, if we are going to pretend that Halloween II didn't exist and that he's after her because she's his sister, you are back to the obvious question of why is he targeting her?¬† Of all the people in the world, why would he be so intent on killing her 40 years later?¬† I expect this film will be absolutely littered with huge plot holes that make no sense."

ek1ePFp-nBI,i think they ruined the story with this one -- it should have started where 5 ended -- jamie at the police station where michael gets away -- years pass and jamie finds out her mother is alive and has a brother as well -- they reunite knowing michael is coming for them -- laurie visits loomis grave as a tribute to donald pleasance -- michael kills the son -- and is after jamie and laurie -- only this time they are ready or are they -- michael kills jamie leaving laurie to end the curse or be cursed -- laurie finds a way to kill michael and end the curse or does she -- the movie ends with a mask and laurie pulls it off to reveal herself and perhaps she has inherited the curse and the movie ends or does it --

ek1ePFp-nBI,By the way.... we will %65 see him without his mask. Full blown. Who‚Äôs going to be him in the unmasking scene is James Jude Courtney. He will be in the movie. He is probably the guy who is playing as Michael in the scene where he shows him the mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For crying out loud! Here we go again with the Michael Myers character! Frigging movies today are so cliche with sequel after sequel after sequel after sequel and so on, until the paying public says ""Enough with all the 'Halloween' slasher crap! Is this all cinematic 'entertainment (?)' is anymore? The visual representation of crazed, maniacal killers running around with knives and hatchets and axes and who knows what else, maiming and dismembering, killing and hacking human victims just so some greedy film producer and his cohorts can make even more profit on an idea that has become copied, time and time again??? Is this the level of savagery our human values aspire to now? That's not entertainment anymore... it's sick!     And...  sad. I refuse to see this movie! And now, the production team knows!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah let's just throw together another remake without even bothering to respect the storyline of the original series and we're not gonna bother to create something new either. Cuz we're just running out of ideas period and we really think all moviegoers are too stupid to notice. Fuck you, Hollywood!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Rob Zombie made a couple of spin off. The ones without Jaime Lee Curtis are the ones made by John Carpenter. Halloween 3 Season of the witches had NOTHING TO DO WITH MICHAEL MYERS. The plot of that movie sucked and they really had no right to even use HALLOWEEN in the title. When you hear about Camp Crystal Lake Jason Vorhees will remain the main character,   Nightmare On Elm Street belongs to Freddie. A lot of the spin offs really don't make sense like Jason being out in space. THIS IS THE SEQUEL HORROR FANS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. I really haven't been scared since The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre with LEATHER FACE.......WE SHALL SEE IF THIS WAS WORTH THE WAIT."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"My only problem with this is that, I don't think Laurie would develop an obsession like this, if we are ignoring all the sequels, he's not the Michel Myers that's been established through the series.
So he would just be some psycho that attacked her many years ago.
I think realistically, she would be more like she was in H20. Scarred by what happened, but living her life as best as she can.

That being said, it does look good and cinematically true to the original."

HE ENDS UP KILLING HER TO OFFICIALLY END THE ""HALLOWEEN"" SERIES!

I don't know that but I got to thinking about it last night. 

EVERYONE, is expecting her to officially kill Michael--ending his ALL-TIME evil, brutal, & his serial-murder massacres; while Jamie Lee Curtis escapes alive, just because she has in every other ""Halloween"" movie! 

I feel they're gonna have this messed up pot twist because no one expecting it will make it an AWESOME movie and it will eventually sell out a lot more once it sells out every day for the first week in every theatre and then when it gets word all on the streets that EVERYONE needs to see it. These are such awesome movies because being a baby born in 1990, I had such an amazing and awesome childhood....
Movies such as:
 ""Friday the 13th"" 
 ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and
 ""Halloween"" 
All bring back such bittersweet memories of my childhood growing up!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder what would happen if you put this michael in an mma cage against say brock lesner? Just say he fights by the rules...does he win?
ek1ePFp-nBI,wish Rob zombie would of made it.  his was the best
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so excited to watch it I like Micheal Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait a minute, who is that at the blue window at 2:08?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt flop.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People got an early preview and said it is Halloween, and that it does the series justice.  I have heard nothing but good things.  They also said it is a very heavy R rating and it is extremely brutal."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do I want to see it I hate scary movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seeing those teeth is horrifying, I would try to jump down that toilet"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The score to this movie makes my hair stand on end. So simple, but so effective."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm now scared of Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yep, the music still terrifies me. I have been afraid of Michael Myers since I was about 8 and was never really sure why. The mask is devoid of any human emotions...no one can tell what he is thinking and he is so calm in his movement. He would be less scary running top speed toward someone I think. It is the slow, calculated, methodical moving that is truly horrifying...and of course that big knife...We fear the unknown, always will"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ü¶á Interesting, They've Re-made. Remember Original, Very Scary + That Spooky Music... ü¶á"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Awesome trailer! I'm glad it showed what was in the boy's closet, so I know ahead of time what's going to happen and not be frightened."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hate these mini trailers before the trailer. It's like spoiling the trailer because you need more things to spoil in regard to your film.

It was osm movie."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yassssssss I played dead by daylight and saw Micheal Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is gonna be so freaking HYPE! 40 year anniversary of the ORIGINAL ""HALLOWEEN""! üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"At the end of this movie, Michael Myers is defeated because he forgets to take his Metamucil."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It is one of the escaped bus crash lunatics IMPERSONATING Michael who is doing the killings! Michael also escapes and will turn up in the inevitable boring sequel-yawn-.Notice how he uses his LEFT hand in the trailer picking up the hammer. You've been sold a pup and this rubbish STILL continues after 40 years!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,MELHOR FILME DE TERROR DE TODOS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dun dun duhhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If michael is not her brother why is he going after her then, and why is she so paranoid about him, atleast the sibling connection made sense why he would target her, without it hes just a random psycho that attacked her years ago, this looks good but the contents behind the story make no sense."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is so confusing because how did the Police apprehend Michael after we saw in the 1978 movie that after Loomis looked over the balcony he was gone.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis looks more better than ever in this Halloween movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow the new Halloween movie looks great I'm going to go see it probably
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This beats Annabelle and all those new Scary Movies, who Agrees"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre retconning the sequels.  It was probably advice from John Carpenter, and ask me, it‚Äôs a wise choice.  In my own mind, I had decided long ago that the story ended after Dr. Loomis blew him out of that window in 1978."
ek1ePFp-nBI,SPOIL ALERT!!! DONT READ SAW THE MOVIE...Plot twist: Laurie is hallucinating the whole thing. SHE is the one in a mental institution from the trauma. theres also a sequel. they dont die. at the end of halloween michael was never arrested..he dissapeared. the second will probably be really good since michael will somehow track laurie down or vise versa..soo good.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just released my second video based on the NEW trailer. A MORE ACCURATE VERSION :') Check it out, would appreciate the feedback :)) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzqTK-rJQeI"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why does Michael kill teenagers and adults but not children?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seeing as this is set 40 years after the original, that would mean Michael is in his early 60s. Let's see if he is still up to it :) Part of me thinks that because Michael wears the mask, how do we know it is actually Michael behind the mask? Maybe one of the other prisoners who escape from the bus assumes his identity and goes on the rampage. That writer guy gives away Michael's history by visiting him in the hospital; surely some other psychopath could be paying attention? I can imagine the whole movie Jamie Lee Curtis trying to kill MIchael and when she finally does so, she takes off the mask, and it's a guy in his 20s behind it. Now that would be a good shock ending. Where is the real Michael??..sequel, baby!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,wait michael myer isn't supposed to kill any kid?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This could have been laid to rest years ago. Should have been Michael vs Jason, instead of Freddy."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love the shot of him flipping the knife in his hand as he walks, great cinematography"
ek1ePFp-nBI,For those of you wondering yes they have retconned Laurie being Michael Myers sister the reason for this according to John Carpenter and Danny McBride it made Michael less scary as people wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about him since they weren‚Äôt related to him with this they can show that it doesn‚Äôt matter who you are Michael Myers the boogeyman will kill you all the same
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh wow, so this is like a Horror version of Home Alone with an old woman instead of a little boy?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This could be Sick.......best horror franchise without a doubt.....PLEASE DONT SUCK!!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:06 GET OUT THE WOAD
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is not crazy he just has Ligma
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So here's the thing:
I have no trouble with reboots. I have no trouble with sequels. I have no trouble with Star Wars, Episodes I - III, Episodes VII - IX. I have no trouble with Halloween whatever. Why? Because the original movie still exists. No one forces you at gunpoint to erase the memory of what the original movie(s) mean to you. So what if Halloween had 150 crappy sequels, or got reboot 16 times? So what if the Star Wars preqels sucked? They only have an effect on the original content if you let it. Simple as that.

Then there's this. Sure, all of what I previously just said applies. But here's a new one. They actually try to make this a DIRECT sequel of the original movie. Fine. But...they feel the need to CHANGE THE ENDING? Please. That's lazy writing on a level I can't even fathom. Screw this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

ek1ePFp-nBI,1:04 more shots fired than Loomis in ‚Äò78
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Super psyched for this movie but I don't like how Laurie and Michael aren't siblings anymore bc IMO without the whole sibling thing it... doesn't make any sense as to why he was so deadset on Laurie other than ""he's just crazy!!"" Which is,,,,, a really boring plot. It gave a connection between Michael and Laurie but now it's like... why would he come back to kill her specifically? What possible reason could he have to be obsessed with her? It also went along with the whole ""sister killing"" thing with judith"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Strange to erase the second movie, but alright. This could either be okay or really bad. I don‚Äôt have very high expectations lol but maybe I‚Äôll be proven wrong."
ek1ePFp-nBI,That moment he's putting on the mask people in theatre will go apeshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This as a while just looks terrible. Like, is Myers suppose to be cheesey? Because it looks like a last wrap up in the form of another teen movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,i seen this movie already taylor swift dies in it sounding like the child from predator 2 with her voice saying want some candy then she gets stabbed in her crotch to death. i was crying in tears of joy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well I have seen all the Michael Myers Halloween movies and I am praying this is the best to come.
ek1ePFp-nBI,You could make a movie of a scary man pissing in the whole movie and Americans would spend millions to watch it! They get you idiots everytime with the exact same movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So.. this is the real part 3. Besides, anyone forget that Jaime Lee's character shot him right in the eyes and blinded him before Dr Loomis blew the lab up and burnt him and Michael's mask to a crisp?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still cant believe Jamie lee Curtis is playing a old women she was so sexy back in the days

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just to make things clear for some of you wondering why Michael Meyers had his head chopped off in Halloween H20 and survived.
Doctors have perfected a new procedure where they can reattach your head in minutes. It's been done in cartoons for years."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"SO looking forward to this!!  The original is my favorite horror movie of all time, and except for Halloween II and H20, all the sequels and the Rob Zombie remakes sucked donkey balls, so I'm glad they're pretending those never happened.  Bring on Laurie vs. Michael!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the reason why I never leave home W/out a handgun!
ek1ePFp-nBI,To be fair the people deserve to die showing Michael Myers his mask is like the worst thing you can do

ek1ePFp-nBI,For the Next movie Jamie Lee Curtis/Laurie Strode ‚ÄúBecomes‚Äù Mike Myers. Wearing the Halloween Mask Laurie Strode has her overalls/dress ripped off which falls away but she has on underwear which is soon soaking in the blood  of her prey and  keeps on relentlessly pursuing victims in her bra and blade slashing away . Then at the end of the film we find that she is having a Nightmare and that the whole film was a Nightmare. ‚Ä¶It would be the Ultimate Halloween movie !!! ‚Ä¶ It would be The Box Office $mash Hit of All Time !!! ‚Ä¶ Highest grossing All Time Moneywise !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The Shape of Evil...Michael (""The Shape"") Myers is looking damned good, considering he's born in 1957 (possibly '58), according to the 1978 original¬†(at one time known as 'The Babysitter Murders').¬†Actor¬†Donald Pleasance and producer Debra Hill aren't the only ones from the first movie¬†who's died of course - but at least two persons have died a violent death; Syrian born exec. producer Moustapha Akkad, b. 1930 in Aleppo¬†and a devoted Muslim, was killed with his daughter and many more in a horrible, islamist¬†suicide bombing at a luxury hotel in Amman, the capital of Jordan, in 2005. He also executive produced the following 7 H'ween¬†sequels, after which his son Malek took over (he'd¬†already been invoved in H7 and H8), and continued¬†work with the franchise, incl. the one above. 

And the relatively unknown 13-year-old¬†Adam Hollander (I've found no relation to Tom...), who debuted onscreen in 'Halloween' (1978) as ""Keith"", was killed by a car while driving his bike, few weeks¬†shy of¬†his 20th b-day in¬†1984. He's seen here, 2nd from the left: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390866/mediaviewer/rm1995274752¬†(The tiny guy to the right is the son, Mickey,¬†to another of the original movie's producers, Irwin Yablans, who's produced some 15 horror movies in his day.) 

The 30-year-old genious who brought his original 1978 script to Akkad Sr. was the same guy who co-produced it, as well as the above 2018¬†movie version,¬†directed the original, as well as composed, played¬†and recorded its soundtrack,¬†incl.¬†one of the most¬†recognized, beloved and scary¬†horror movie¬†themes (https://youtu.be/lNMIlubmwOQ) ever,¬†Mr. John Carpenter, is now 70, and tours with his movie music around the globe, and has become a rock star of sorts...I'm really looking forward to this movie, although I'm almost as old as Michael Myers... 

""Loomis:¬†I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil."" 

Also: ""Was it the Boogey Man?"" [Laurie in the end] ""Yes."" [Loomis] 

Due to its shoestring budget (~$300,000*), the prop department had to use the cheapest $2 mask that they could find in the costume store: a Star Trek (1966) William Shatner mask. They later spray-painted the face white, teased out the hair, and reshaped the eye holes. Shatner admitted that for years he had no idea his likeness was used for this film. It was only during an interview that someone mentioned his mask was being used. He has since stated that he is honored by this gesture. 

*) The movie made some $70 mill. wordwide, 40 years ago. A Marvel movie today costs ~$150-200 (!)¬†mill, and rakes it in the first weekend. 'Halloween' (2018) cost ~10 mill. bucks, which is the equivalent of Tom Cruise's shoe budget in any given movie, just to make him 6-8 cm (2-3 inches) taller, just like Sly Stallone and Arnold Shwarzenegger... 

Yada, yada, nada."

ek1ePFp-nBI,This dude is turning 60 and is still going going after teenagers on Halloween! What the heck!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"See, Rob Zombie, this is how you make a Halloween movie!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good but I also wouldn‚Äôt mind a follow up to Halloween 3 too.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this technicly a reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,I lost my shit at 1:56 üò¨ the theme song makes me hyped. Been waiting for this the whole time!üëèüòÉ

ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dang it Blumhouse üòû
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thankfully, Rob Zombie wasn't there to ruin this one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, I understand that this movie is creating a whole new timeline/universe by portraying itself as the sequel to the very first movie by ignoring all of the original sequels. But by doing so, what I don't understand is that in the original Michael was about 18-20 years old when he escaped (if not older.) This movie is taking place 40 years after the original - which should make him between 50-60 years old. How is he even threatening, let alone an unstoppable killing machine? Did he take too many opioids for his rheumatoid arthritis and just felt invincible? (that's just an old person joke - ha ha).All kidding aside -  It's just, if they are going to create a whole new universe with this film, to follow the original, will he still have his supernatural powers? If so, I'm curious how they'll explain it. And if not, how is father-time not a bigger factor? None the less, I am still excited for this movie and I hope it'll be better than the garbage heap remakes that Rob Zombie put out."
ek1ePFp-nBI,we sell halloween tshirts for 14.99
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow! Now that looks good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm excited the new movie Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,In a couple of years they'll act like this one never existed either lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next Month He comes Home to play
ek1ePFp-nBI,What I don't understand that is that if they are continuing from the original and ignoring all the sequels how exactly does that not make them related? In the original the dude literally put Laurie's mothers tombstone on the bed along with her dead friend. How would that even be remotely significant if they weren't brother and sister?
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this skinny mother fucker ain't the new mike
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why didnt they put him to death sentence?

ek1ePFp-nBI,His mask looks like the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,WILL WE SEE MICHAEL'S FACE?!?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That‚Äôs not fair, did you see how many survivors there were on the street running around??? I swear they say killers are underpowered but they didn‚Äôt have to buff survivors like that. Damn"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's mom really tryin to give her son the fade
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When it released the movie?

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Still can‚Äôt get over this trailer , keep watching this from people on Instagram called @strodescenes , they post BTS of the new movie and loads of updates , they‚Äôve also hyped me up so much for this movie !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This one may end up being good(it looks like it will)......but Halloween 2 (1981) was a worthy sequel to the original and  the Michael Myers story should have ended right there. That was the last quality sequel involving Myers. I was hoping that this new one would include the events of H2, however as we've seen with subsequent sequels in this franchise (H4-8) there may not have been any way to credibly incorporate H2 after Myers was basically burnt to a crisp at the end of it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I get that Halloween is a classic slasher movie, but do they honestly think that they could compete with VENOM?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Literally comes out on my birthday. Midnight showing, my dudes!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*This Ones Going To Be Epic*

ek1ePFp-nBI,1:45 He stole those from the tooth fairy and the tooth fairy wants them back!

ek1ePFp-nBI,How is this not going to be released October 31st?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow I like to see the new movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got scared at the end
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like the opening clip where there dog is panicked and mental patient laughs. That's WOW! Also the last clip where Micheal is hiding in closet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here's what I don't understand, if Laurie and Michael are not related, then why in the world does Laurie think Michael is coming for her. And why is Michael gunning for her, I mean Michael's whole drive is to kill his family and whoever else gets in his way. Junk food for thought!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got chills when he put the mask on.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is old as fuck..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers will always be the best killer out or the big 3(Michael, Freddy, Jason)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,just 1:53 <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So since it's doing away with ALL the sequels and he WAS captured that night after he was shot, they must be doing away with the whole immortal / supernatural / can't me kill me thing. I wonder if they'll finally kill him... Until the next reboot."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm fucking hyped!!! So excited for October
ek1ePFp-nBI,WAITINGFOR MY FAVORITE SCARY MOVIE EVER!!!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,1:59 I thought this is the remake of the first one but it is the remake of the second one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Taking that mask into the asylum is like taking liquor into an AA meeting.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kinda wish they would have kept part 2 Canon with this but that's ok still gonna watch this and love it. Also plus if Michael  was born in 1957 in this timeline  as well he's  still doing  this when he's  61 like shit still scary as hell.

ek1ePFp-nBI,From what we‚Äôve seen Micheal looks young and he‚Äôs 61 looking well
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this will be a treat. Frankly, I think Moustapha Akkad fucked up the original by whoring it out for decades. It will be interesting to see how much they can salvage."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They gave away WAY TOO much in this trailer. Don't need to pay for a ticket now.

ek1ePFp-nBI,How was he even captured when he disappeared at the end of the first one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚ÄúNo it was not her brother, that‚Äôs the myth that people made up...‚Äù

So then I guess that means the rest of the movies after the first one (1978) are just the stories made up by people who live in Haddonfield while Michael Myers was alive and locked up. I guess after Loomis shot him, Michael got up, walked somewhere else and collapsed again because he was shot 6 times and fell from a second story house. Then the police found his unconscious but still alive body and arrested him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This Halloween movie will suck ass
I've foreseen it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why am I watching this so early in the morningüôÑ I jumped when he popped up in that closet door

ek1ePFp-nBI,"he had enough of survivors hiding in the closet, he's camping it in evil within 1, no terror radius"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why wouldn't the hot chick turn off the closet light first? Because then we wouldn't see Michael. Hollywood logic is awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The important thing is that Ben took Laurie to the dance and Bud and Jimmy continued to bang nurses and save lives. So stoked for this movie. #shapehappens
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too bad Donald Pleasence is not in this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Even the damn dog knrw that wasn't a smart idea. üòÅüòÖ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Do you get the feeling that Laurie Strode is every bit as crazy as Michael?
ek1ePFp-nBI,What i love about this movie and this francise is Jamie le Curtis started this film when she was young and now seing her older in the movie it makes it even better and its like hes coming after her in real life.And also how all the camera and video technology and the world has changed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm hyped for the remake

ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else like...... Michael.... you‚Äôre like 60 now......... how you gonna get around so well and kill everyone!!??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie won't survive. She's too capable. Like the escape artist in Cube. With her around, you know everything will be all right. You don't want audiences to know that watching a horror film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a 18 or 15?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandpa Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wish I had someone to watch this with.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought they had 3 showdowns already.  Come up with a new idea... Oh wait it's hellywood
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else has a deeper appreciation for this sequel since seeing the original Halloween in theaters? I remember I took my date to the drive-in in my '77 Oldsmobile Cutlass. üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"At 1:39 if you look to the bottom left of the screen you will see a pickup truck and a silver car, look between them and you may have come across what you were looking for ;) (I think it‚Äôs Michael stalking the man entering the shop, and it takes place with the bathroom scene as well, OR it may not even be Michael to begin with and may just be the male investigator leaving car after parking it so he can investigate the building.) EITHER way it‚Äôs definetly worth taking note of, there is someone clearly standing between the two vehicles."
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57-0:59 reminds me a bit of the Jurassic Park theme. (Different pitch though)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that charlie from supernatural?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has to be the final chapter it‚Äôs too good üéÉüíÄüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,ANOTHER TIMELINE?!?!?! REALLLLLY DUDE
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope this won't be a shameless cashgrab
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did she fake her death... Or did she not die in resurrection? I mean either way I can't wait to see this damn movie!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm definitely seeing that movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does this make every other movie of Halloween after the original non canonical?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nothing like grandmas killing monsters, 1st jeepers creepers 3 and now halloween"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanna watch this for my b-day üòÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet part is meme material
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes! The Legend is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really fucking good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I find it funny this guy shows the mental patient the mask he wore when killing people, like that wasn't going to start something. ""Michael look what I have here, your William Shatner mask"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good hope it doesn't spoil the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer isn't really HD?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oueeee I can't waitüî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I loved these movies, but she already killed him (cut his head off). Just as the first 5 Friday the 13th movies were possible, so were the Halloween movies - until this one. Michael is dead. Stop making ""what if"" movies!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is a legend when It comes to Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Also I play dead by daylight Michael myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So could have named it Halloween: michaels revenge, or halloween: the final chapter, or halloween: lets just forget the rob zombie movies okay? BUT NO it's 2010 again and we have to rename our frandchise so we make IMDB pages FUCKING CONFUSING"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just realised something so halloween (2018) releases on october 19th 2018 and I read about michael‚Äôs origins and learnt from halloween (2007) that he was born on october 19th 1957 now aint that a fucking coincidence?.. oh hell no it feels like another rebirth!
ek1ePFp-nBI,michael with the clutch
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope this dosent flop
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait for this, not long now!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead By Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit shouldn‚Äôt of watched that before bed üò∞
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 1 is by far is the second best in the franchise and this looks to cap off part 1. People who watch Halloween movies later on and not when they came out should never have a comment of what‚Äôs good and bad as they are not fans but critics.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In David Gordon Green, we trust. Hopefully."
ek1ePFp-nBI,No matter what they will never beat carpenters original masterpiece.......The new movies of today try to hard.
ek1ePFp-nBI,When are they going to make Friday the 13th and nightmare on Elm street
ek1ePFp-nBI,They Shouldn't stop making Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,If only robZombie did this film :'(
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How old was Michael Myers in 1978? Because depending on that he's either in his late 50's or early 60's if he was twenty or older, or if he was in his teens when he escaped from the asylum"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this is scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if James a janiesse (I think his name was) aka dead meat will do a kill number on this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so excited to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great!
ek1ePFp-nBI,1978 to 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,o filme vai cer muito bom
ek1ePFp-nBI,"T-shirt for Halloween is beautiful and at a good price

ek1ePFp-nBI,Great so now he's an old fart
ek1ePFp-nBI,DBD
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one who thinks the ending part with the girl trying to close the closet is actually pretty funny? I can‚Äôt stop laughing at that
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this man immortal or what..i still remember his head had been cut by his sister at the last part of the movie bt still I do like haloween lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAAAAASSSSS LAURIE STRODE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! üíÖüèºüíÖüèºüíÖüèºüíÖüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,Same night dumb ass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The sequel is still the first one moron.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This motherfucker is so dumb. He doesnt even realize that john carpenter directed number 2. So why would the director write off the movie that takes place on the same night? Aha
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shall i get you an earlier articall dumb ass? Its all over the web
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was Michael banging his head on the bathroom stall door?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's very easy to figure out cupcake. Number 2 was in that same night dumb shit. So naturally it was shortly after he was shot. HELLO!!! SAME NIGHT JACK ASS
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie will be my favorite: halloween 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it impossible to make a new Friday the 13th movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well his sister waited for him and he dosent know how to use a gun so use a axe and a gun
ek1ePFp-nBI,I will 100% watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm rooting for Michael and it's also pretty good to see he finally came out of the closet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks absolutely amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Me playing dead by daylight while fixing the Generator at the last part.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Hey Michael, I brought your sister here to taunt you lmao you a bitch, member when you got caught? Haha lil bitch boy what are you gonna do about it?"" 
*Trailer happens*
""Oh"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lol @ an old Michael Myers stalking teens, one kick to his balls and he is dead."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice Trailer üéÉüî™ HALLOWEEN

ek1ePFp-nBI,It won‚Äôt be good remakes always suk
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs finally back
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOL at all the people who doubted and said the trailer was fake to begin with. Fucking idiots.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope its good cause after the first 2 it went donhill pretty fast. The only one that I liked was Rob Zombie's Halloween from 2007
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this 18s in Ireland or 16s?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so hyped to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Theme music is my babys mommas ring tone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone down for some rainbow six Michael Meyers. Michael has to be sledge
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:53 This will beat the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shittttt
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Love the trailer. I hope for the closet scene the producers have added Michael's heavy breathing in this shot, I think that would make this scene even scarier."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do crazy people got a dog üíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait for it !!! my favorite killer Michael Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,More Like walk boi

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone else confused as to why they called it Halloween, when it's a sequel to Halloween?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did she ever close the closet door
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't get it
So is he still a force of evil that is immortal because of the curse and the only way he can die is by killing all his family members?
Or is he mortal in this movie and no longer Laurie's older brother.
Fucking confused."
ek1ePFp-nBI,BOUT FUCKING TIME!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait till 2028 ... that one is gonna be awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,HAHAHA! He come back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guys Michael walks because he‚Äôs tired.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt he get away after getting shot in the original?? Idk I've only seen the first one so I'm not sure how the other movies go down
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Boy, they really wanna milk this cow beyond death"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Jamie Lee Curtis!!!!! <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,This mf headbutted the door lmaooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear if we don't get a new outfit for Laurie in Dead By Daylight when this movie comes out I'm never wasting my money on DLC ever again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,At least he is not maskless plus this looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Spoookaaay!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've got a feeling this is either gunna suck ass or be one of the best horror films this generation
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this f school this is better
ek1ePFp-nBI,i feel like they just showed me the whole movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,holly shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,*_my moms weave is now in asia_*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I straight up got chills in the movie theater when this played on the trailers. That, is when it was confirmed I'd was going to see it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I pray the movie is better than this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks horrible tbh.
ek1ePFp-nBI,AHEM DEAD MEAT WILL HAVE TO DO THIA
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks nice :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a horror/funny film if it is my dream come true

ek1ePFp-nBI,#DEADBYDAYLIGHT
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:34 I hope the polar bear lives
ek1ePFp-nBI,You'd think by now they would know there is no way to kill Michael Myers...he's been shot numerous times and stabbed....and even burned up once...he just keeps coming back...like what's the use?.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt Laurie die in Halloween Resurrection lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooooo... the rob zombie ones don't count... this is a reboot... and a sequel... but also like the last 4 halloween's don't count? I thought jlc jumped off a roof or some tlshit in h20... or resurrection... or one of them...
ek1ePFp-nBI,This guy never dies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought They both died!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What Halloween part is that
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael was captured and put into captivity after getting shot by Lumis, meaning that after he fell off the balcony, and where his body disappeared after Lumis looks over, Michael was either taken into custody, or that he escaped."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only horror movie slasher who genuinely makes me paranoid
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait to see ittttt
ek1ePFp-nBI,In case you guys didn't know. this is part 2 to Halloween 1978. so its a sequel to the 1978 original film.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully the last Halloween movie ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As soon as I saw this trailer I said ""gotta show this to my boyfriend"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really liked the ending of Halloween h20 but if this is the ending okay
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just call it the return of Michael Myers. We already have three movies named Halloween. You‚Äôre confusing people. Is this a remake or not?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael called into the bosses office....""Dammit Michael!....how many times do I have to tell you?...you don't rip the teeth out of the kids mouth! You wait for them to fall out and they put them under their pillows and you go in at night...QUIETLY...and take them, and you leave them some money and you leave them ALIVE! One more complaint and your outta here...You got that, now get the hell out of my office!""....."
ek1ePFp-nBI,As soon as the music kicked in.... NOSTALGIA
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt Wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,When thw music kicked in tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:55
2:00
My favorite sounds"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Alright now!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this gonna be the third fucking movie in the Halloween franchise just titled Halloween??? What the hell is going on with the directors or the producers or whatever?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many comments do you think are Dead By Daylight refferences?
ek1ePFp-nBI,i well see it until my birthday 12 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,Been a fan since forever. Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Piru pupiru
ek1ePFp-nBI,If he's not her brother in this one why would he still come for her
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm waiting for this movie to come out so bad üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Myers is old :l
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeay is Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,As someone that was born on Halloween I really hope it's superior than every single other lacklustre sequel they've attempted. Ambitious to reboot something they've tarnished so frequently. Keeping expectations deservedly low.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just simply can‚Äôt wait for this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie:I've been praying every night for him to escape 
Cop:why in the hell would you do that 
Jamie:for I could kill him
Me in the back:fuck this shit I'm out
Me:please reply"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Must Hollywood ruin everything good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Before anyone attacks me with hate comments let me just say that this movie looks fucking awesome and I'm really psyched about it. Looks very nostalgic and it seems as though Carpenter and McBride have done an excellent job. That being said, I just wanted to mention that I noticed some copycat motifs here in the trailer. Michael attacking the girl in the bathroom stall for one. Didn't that happen to Neve Campbell in the first Scream? Hmmmm. And the bus crashing and Michael escaping seems a little too close to the plot of The Fugitive don't you think? I hope Michael doesn't start searching for the one armed    man. LOL
Okay now here come the hate comments. Fire away..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seeing the actor returns as an actual granny facing again michael in the scene of  the crime was pretty much a surprise.Though i like the classics for what they stand for in the legacy of the cinema all of those years,i think they overdid it because of the nostalgia and that it sells merchandise!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks insanely great!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey Dbags, you don't show ""GOTCHA"" moments on trailers or you lose giant chunks of your audience. I, for one of MANY use THIS fact to determine whether to go to the theater or put a movie at the end of my bucket-queue, in hopes that I'll have forgotten spoilers by the time I've finished the most recent season of something else, that DIDN'T give away the goods in a trailer. There's so much out to watch already, why would people buy the cow when you give the milk away free. That bathroom scene and closet scene on this might as well be cut from the movie and added to the ""additional scenes"" on a future edit, among other things. I'm going to do you amateurs a favor because Universal makes good pics. This is exactly what you DON'T need out of a movie trailer. https://youtu.be/J7w9uWFIMBs By ""this"", I mean ""Cliff Notes version of the entire movie""."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ain‚Äôt This Nigga 80yrs Old Now.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,What micheal myers was thinking in the that window shooting in the trailer: HA HA SUCKER CANT GET ME CAUSE THIS IS A MIRROR MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

The franchise has always been one of divergence and what ifs. This is simply another timeline.The fifth to be exact."

ek1ePFp-nBI,I was born in 2000 and didn't really grow up watching these kinds of movie cuz i would be too young but i really want to know if there's any other movie to watch in chronological order before this one

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael is back to being a normal sized person, and not an eight foot hulk.  This seems promising."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm Fucking scared shitless and I like it. Too bad Donald Pleasance is gone. He really made those movies with his impeccable acting. Can't wait to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I liked the bigger Michael myers in the 2007,2009 rob zombie films, he was a better much bigger scarier actor , should‚Äôve been the Michael Myers for this one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so damn ready for this!

ek1ePFp-nBI,trailers these days suck. They lost its touch..
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:07 does anyone noticed that there some one else too as a stalker
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy crap I never really saw halloween movies as horror movies since they were never *really* scary and I just watched them for the story, but this looks scary af. I'm so excited :O"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:56 when the theme kicks in, pumped for this!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"how are they explaining this, I know the ending for the first one was a cliffhanger for 2 to pick up on, are they changing the ending, Michael falls off a house, disappears, then caught him, I mean think about that. such a great cliffhanger just left for nothing. I hope they have a good explanation"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original ending with Michael mysteriously gone was perfect. Should've just left it as it was.  He got captured shortly after?  Lame.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why can't they just stop with all these crappy sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes and create something new and creative instead of warming up one classic after another? If this trend goes on we'll soon have a new Jaws sequel, a Jurassic Park remake or a goddamn ""Godfather: The Beginning"" prequel shit!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wish I didn't watch this trailer ...
It spoiled so many scenes and plot points ..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,I know it‚Äôs gonna be good because H20 is my favorite along with the 1978 original film so if this is H40 how can it possibly do any wrong?
ek1ePFp-nBI,2;08 left window i think that's michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,He finally came back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,so they're ignoring halloween 2 and he's not her sister. so basically there's a non-existant story to continue.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don‚Äôt turn the Boogeyman into Regularman. That would be unforgivable. There is nothing regular about Michael Myers...
ek1ePFp-nBI,DBD
ek1ePFp-nBI,I do wish this was the bad ass Laurie in h20.

What do you think will happen? Will Haddonfield become another big bloodbath? Or will it all change this year?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So psyched
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if they would just do the first HALLOWEEN film back in 1978 and then wait for 2018 40 years later to do HALLOWEEN.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else glad they‚Äôre ditching the Laurie/Michael sibling plot?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit looks trash but I‚Äôm gonna see it anyways
ek1ePFp-nBI,i think this MOVIE will be like tupac s movie all eyes on me i think pac would approve of this movie... fun fact strode is actually a rapper in real life
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is Michael immortal?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is Michael still Laurie brother

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why they gotta be fucking up the stature of well known characters? The actor that plays this Mike Myers is 5'-10"" and a normal weight. Almost all the previous Mike Myers are like 6'-7"", 300 lbs. It's like tiny Bane (Tom Hardy) in TDKR all over again. Lame."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice! üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck Hurry Up October!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,love it üíñ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait for this, I used to always have dreams about Michael Myers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""He was shot 6 times by his psychiatrist  and was taken into custody that night"" last time I checked he ended up burnt crisp that night"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal better make sure he hooks all of the survivors this time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did part 2 not happen in this universe?
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is cactivity? I really wanna know
ek1ePFp-nBI,Baba yaga
ek1ePFp-nBI,ready to see this Halloween 40 years later movie

ek1ePFp-nBI,Just think about it... if the rest of the Halloweens don't matter except for Halloween one and Michael has been locked up for 40 years he's going to come back and FUCK SHIT UP!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude I fucking love the HALLOWEEN movie! I think that the movie HALLOWEEN sucks. But I‚Äôm looking forward to HALLOWEEN.
ek1ePFp-nBI,dislike 1000%
ek1ePFp-nBI,Put it on netflix
ek1ePFp-nBI,I had to wait 7 years BUT IT WAS WORTH IT
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I finally watched the original Halloween today. Fantastic 10/10 movie, I‚Äôm so hyped for this now"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like a fan made movie lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,i hope michael kills her this time!! i hate feminists!! they are poison to society...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm lost. Didn't she die in the beginning of Halloween: Resurrection. The one with Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Leather Face.... the big 4 in the horror universe! üíÄ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mickey is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:35 is this Michael ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòÆ Jamie Lee Curtis still looks good for her age.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kill this franchise
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHERE IS THE PALLET!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve loved the movie Halloween for so long like today the horror movies are eh but back in the 70s Halloween oh my god I can‚Äôt wait for this movie to come out !
ek1ePFp-nBI,So am I the only one who‚Äôs gonna watch this right when it comes out? üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I be 23 when this comes out . better be the best fucking birthday present ever üëªüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 the Halloween bgm never gets old
ek1ePFp-nBI,the best part is at 1 53
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok I get that it continues from the first movie but can they use the same mask from the original? Just give shantner the damn money already to use his likeness or whomever you have to pay to get it done. Its the mask that makes it terrifying and stop trying to make it more over the top than it really is. Just get back to the basics and stop trying to over think this thing. After II the sequels were a bunch of crap  the only thing good that came out of some of them was the acting of Donald Pleasence.
ek1ePFp-nBI,when the halloween theme song dropped it gave my goosebumps
ek1ePFp-nBI,Better than rob zombie movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Showing Rob Zombie how it's done.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where is tralier number 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,He killed her in the last one üôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,He has the same name as Austin Powers actor üòÖüòÖüòÖ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully Mikey's gonna show Hollywood how to make good horror movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that a Winchester!?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish this came out before oct 4 because my bday is oct 4 and I would Halloween on my bday but it‚Äôs on oct 19th maybe I can watch it on Halloween but I got school fuck me and of course middle schoolers get out at 3:30
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding, Ding Ding Ding Ding"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This was my face to the entire video 0_0
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another feminist propaganda piece. Modern cinema sucks.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am very excited.And, just to be clear this is exactly after the first Halloween ??("
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well It seems like the New Era of Old School Slasher movies is the Era of Redemption for the Protagonist Look at this Laurie has obviously been waiting a long time to kill him same thing with Andy in the Child's play Serious he finally killed Chucky in curse  and he's torturing the original one for the rest of eternity look at saw and His Apprentice what's next the girl from the first Texas chainsaw massacre finna kill my son leatherface finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,And now they ignored that laurie strode is the sister ok
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm happy that this movie is going to be release in Fall! I can't wait to see this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be a wonderful film! I can't wait to see this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASS Can't wait looks like this is going to be amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well where do I start...... there are a bunch of reasons this movie will suck..... the obvious is too much was shown in the trailer.... carpenter invented less is more .. so hes lost his touch ..... 2......ignoring all the halloween's is plain stupid at this point the franchise held together better than its opponents after 5 movies  this just kills it for me ....... they had a chance for a perfect franchise back with 5 an fucked it up an 6 changed actors over money ... .3 they could of continued from ressurection to kill Laurie's son hartnett who becomes a cop ect find out Jamie was his sister an find outside she had a kid ... also having Danny coming back from part 6 grown up  an having laurie survive the fall an hence the whole family is there an yo take on Michael ........ also mikey contracts states for lifetime he can never be killed ... so for them to say this is the last movie is asinine ... there will be more an it will be stupid........ side note remake part 3 in 3d IMAX that would be good or make a part 2 for it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Already know its going to be NOWHERE NEAR as good as the original but fine i'll entertain it, might be fun."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I miss Donald Pleasance :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,The shape..cant wait

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:04 EVIL WITHIN lll ACHIEVED
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait. Am I supposed to pretend that none of the sequels ever happened?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they make some jokes/reference to h20 saying Laurie how come you didn't join the witness protection program and became a teacher? Or she had a dream that Michael was after her in the hospital same night they told her Myers is her brother.. (I know they will reference each part) but that would be cool.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs like H20 except Laurie is packing Heat this time
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait for this opening night going right to the theatre.... He came home

ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Jamie Lee Curtis"" being a ""17 year old teenage girl"" in the ""1978 film"" my ass bcause she wasn't born in ""1961"", so fuck the entire ""franchise"" as a result of that.

Edit: I'd take back what I said above after ""my ass"" bcause in the ""2007 remake"" doesn't say how old is ""Laurie Strode"" being portrayed by ""Taylor Scout-Compton"", but actually I don't take it back bcause the ""child actor"" who portrayed a ""young Michael Myers"" wasn't even ""10 years old""."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee.curtis voice is brilliant

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks god awful. The original Halloween was campy and creepy. This looks like some try-too-hard bullshit. Especially with the mental institution at the beginning. That deranged laugh or whatever that actor was trying to do made me cringe.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sooooo this ""Human"" Monster just can't be Killed?? ü§î"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is anyone else disappointed that they H2 is no longer canon? I mean it was the better of the two in my opinion. Also the fact that he got arrested that night after being shot off the balcony sort of sucks as well because it makes him seem like a normal guy (which I understand was John carpenter‚Äôs original intent) but it takes some of the scare factor away. Just my opinion though.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael is looking kind of small, he needs to hit the gym"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is goin to be epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,i am not gonna lie this was insane i cannot wait to see it but sorry michael my hero is jason voorhees
ek1ePFp-nBI,They could easily use dead hard.( DBD Players will understand)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone explain Michael Myers to me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Universal is taking back what's rightfully theirs and recreating a masterpiece!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how she was not scared at all and she was hunting michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit men kwkwkwkw love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,How can Lorie be still alive?? I thought she died in Halloween Resurrection??? ü§®ü§®ü§®
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am i the only one who heard Pingu at 0:46
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So without the mythology of them being related, why would Laurie train, thinking he would come back?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope it‚Äôs good trailers are deceiving sometimes üòë
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait so they're retconning even Halloween II? They should keep that one in, it was good.

Also it's really stupid how they're making Laurie Strode obsessed with him if they did retcon Halloween II. She doesn't really understand why he was so obsessed with her until Halloween II."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the en the beat
ek1ePFp-nBI,Going right from original Halloween to this? So Busta never really knew karate?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I absolutley loved rob zombies take on Halloween , both were fantastic & obviously I like the original , all the others were garbage so it's nice to see they are continuing off the original film ! This does look good!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet he's going to die in this one-
ek1ePFp-nBI,I still want to do Jamie Leigh Curtis.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is just terminator now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How Laurie Strode survived ??? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8rqSJtd0Ss
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who else was here before 10,000 views?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,She‚Äôs Baaack!!!! 1:08
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""What bus crashed?"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry Rob Zombie, but you don't fuck with a masterpiece. Pay attention because THIS is how it's done!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just recently saw the original and it's sequel, im an instant fan of this franchise.
Michael Myers & Laurie üôèüòå"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So annoying seeing all these comments about ""closet"" when here the closet is the thing where you do your pee pee."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG! I can't wait for this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jasons mask looks good,some of the halloween movies it didnt look as creepy as others,liking the way this one looks tho üòÅlooking forward to seeing if this ones a.y goodüëçüèº"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ah yes, the only killer in horror movies that unexpectedly became my hero, he's back"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is the girl version of ""Logan""."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woooo it's the best trailer ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,cool but scarey
ek1ePFp-nBI,im concerned judy greer is going to fuck this up
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope they show him unmasked in this one as they did in the original. Just something to identify him as a person like the rest of us, and not just an unstoppable force of evil, made him even more scary."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Do you like horror movies? Would you like to be in one? What if I told you that a vast majority of you are going to be, like it or not? When you leave this world if you do not have Jesus Christ on your side you will literally star in your own horror movie. There will be demons. There will be unbearable heat. There will certainly be pain. Oh and the monsters, these things will be more real than your worse nightmares. Don't believe me? Go watch the countless videos of those who have went to hell and returned. 
    So this Halloween when you go to see this movie I hope you have the Lord of Lords on your side. Jesus Christ is the only way to escape the eternal horror movie that is hell."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Isn't Michael like 60 now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:02
A knife trick?
That doesn't seem like something Michael would do?
He is supposed to have no   tics,tricks or traits."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I liked psyco 2 in part because of the time between the movies.and the effect of prison on a serial killer. The end of Halloween 1978 is similar to Christine,the thing and many other movies with the idea of undying evil. But this is a big cliche now. How can you avoid this and not develop Michael Myers character? I like the idea that he has lost his prime. Only has sight in one eye. They live and escape from new York both have endings that can delvop Michael Myers intelligently. He can be molded by prison system or escape from new york. Why wouldn't he be waterboarded? Also he can have satire like they live.  People stalking him on social media would be satirical. So in 1978 stalking is hiding behind doors. Now it has taken a digital dimension that is not of his time. But then it's about Jamie Lee Curtis too. She has made a remake and brought her maturity to it. But now we see facing death and vengeance as honest parts of her character. In a way John carpenter's comic book elements of Michael Myers ended up with Rob zombie slapstick horror. But without those elements you could make a Halloween like the movie monster."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by day light looks lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,The king has returned!!! Can‚Äôt wait to see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this look cool it be awesome if there a Jason vs Michael movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm finally old enough to watch a Halloween movie in theaters üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please be good. Please be good. Please be good. Please be good...
ek1ePFp-nBI,My closest wouldn't close for some reason. I'm being serious. Someone help!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,""" I've waited for him "" Bitch keep waiting! ..Lol your not ready or able to take on  ""The Boogyman"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Coming out October 19th 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait I thought she chopped his head off?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone needs to tell laurie strode shotguns do 7 damage.40 years training down the drain :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has had 18 million views.  That's amazing.  Compare it to Glass Which was highly anticipated that's had 10 million views so far.  This is gonna be huge.  If everyone who viewed this trailer goes to see this it will clear $300 million easy.  And i will probably see it twice.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too bad there's no dr loomis
ek1ePFp-nBI,so stoked to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this movie lives up to all it's hype.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,What I love is that we never see is face even on picture only from the back
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF jump scares GALOr
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn the michael Myers theme music is so dope
ek1ePFp-nBI,You think Jamie is just a crazy old lady with loaded guns until you notice Michael Myers strangling you and she shoots his head off and kicks ass!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The theme tune will always be iconic
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just kick his fucking ass 
He is only an old fuck"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Crazy watched since I was a kidüòàüòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,glad I saw this trailer at home and not in a crowded theater...that last scene left with AAAHHH!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie's granddaughter and her two friends walking down the street is very reminiscent of the OG gang (Laurie, Annie and Lynda), I hope we get to see their friendship a little before they all die haha"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If I fucking watch this I won‚Äôt sleep for at least 2 months fuck that
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 the soundtrack fits perfectly here
ek1ePFp-nBI,The king back ‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,So what happened with him trying to kill his niece
ek1ePFp-nBI,He looks cool and diffrent
ek1ePFp-nBI,We are getting alittle closer to October! I really really hope its good. I have watched the trailer so many times and kinda have a idea of how the movie will play out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How did they bring back Jamie Lee Curtis when mikel stabbed her and threw her off a roof unless she has the same abilities as Michael witch would be bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,So badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Se bibbi
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is coming out on my bday
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm so excited, The Halloween franchise has always been my favorite movie franchise, I‚Äôm so happy to be able to see one in theaters"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad ass üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omgüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't know what to make of this, having heard amazing things about the original I hope that this will be good, but I'm almost certain that it will be bad, cinema's turned into an endless cycle of remakes and reboots and sequels"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now can we get Michael Myers fighting another killer like Jason or Freddy
ek1ePFp-nBI,activiaaaaaaa
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHY THE FUCK DO TRAILERS NOW HAVE PREVIEWS.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween: I killed my sister and I'm ready to kill some more.

Halloween 2: Oh she's my sister now it's personal

Halloween 3: Yall hear something?

Halloween 4: My families dead and now I can enjoy spending my life in a coma. I have a neice? SHIT!

Halloween 5: They tried to blow me up, this shit is personal now.

Halloween 6: My neice is dead now I can relax. I have a child and I'm controlled by a cult wtf?!

H20: Man its been 20 years and it's been a hell of a journey. I killed my sister, Loomis is dead, my neice and the cult aren't canon. Life is good. Wait, my sister's still alive..that BITCH!

Resurrection: OKAY I FINALLY KILLED HER NOW I CAN GO HOME AND RELAX. WHO THE FUCK ARE THESE PEOPLE AT MY HOUSE? 

Rob Zombie movies: Yall heard something?

2018: I'm getting too old for this shit"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy shit am I excited!! I've watched every movie thousands of timesss.... kinda looks like a bunch of them packed like the mechanic part, the bathroom part super siked!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So my child plays one of the trick or treater in the movie it jamie all alone thats doing the killing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dean Munsch looks good in a long hair
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dwight: MICHAEL! MICHAEL!

Get it? 
It's from The Office US"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If it means he wouldn‚Äôt come out of the closet who would stay there all night trying to close it
ek1ePFp-nBI,They keep rebooting this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The part at the beginning with the dog is really cool, it kinda creeped me out"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Do you believe in the Boogey Man?""                       me- ""Do you believe in magic?"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks AWESOME!! The original Halloween was in 1978 when Jamie Lee Curtis was only 20. 40 years later and this movie is still going!  Time sure flies !
ek1ePFp-nBI,so i guess this is the good sequel after the orginal making everything else obsolete? i liked the original 1 and 2 hated the rest. as for rob zombies i like how  they touched on his psychological pathology other than that those were the 2 worst ones ive  ever seen.
ek1ePFp-nBI,..2 months !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,My cousin is gonna buy a mask and scare people in the line
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music is intense
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHAT ARE THE NOTES FOR THE PIANO PLAYED IN THIS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How to kill : micheal for good ? no you can""t he immortal
Contain Him ? : Yes in jail forever"
ek1ePFp-nBI,so¬†now this fucker has been locked up 40 years ?¬† what becomes of the other films they made?
ek1ePFp-nBI,laurie strode is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so ready for this movie!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""I've been trick or treated to death tonight""
""You don't know what death is!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Besides this movie coming out, I still can't believe Miramax is making this and I can't believe Miramax still exists"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Both dead in the final showdown of the film. Easy guess. Happened in every Hollywood films.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Both dead in the final showdown of the film. Easy guess. Happened in every Hollywood films.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh mai good üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The movie proposal is interesting, it seems after Halloween Resurrection, Michael felt something like '' Mission Accomplished '' after he thought he killed Laurie, I think he rested a little. I think the movie should show you how he went to the sanitarium again. And for that reason that idiot showed the mask to him, sharpening his senses to kill again. Nick Castle was lucky to play this role again. I think he, George Wilbur and Brad Loree would also have been good choices."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait! I already pre-orderd the new mask!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see this movie it's probably going to be the best one and she straight-up said so I can kill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael look op
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who would win? Micheal Myers or Leather face from texas chainsaw massacre?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael just doesn't seem to know what ""Occupied"" means."
ek1ePFp-nBI,WOW
ek1ePFp-nBI,„ÅäÂÖÑ„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„ÅåÊàª„Å£„Å¶„Åç„Åü„ÅÅÔºÅÔºÅ„Éû„Ç∏„ÇÅ„Å£„Å°„ÇÉ„Åã„Å£„Åì„ÅÑ„ÅÑÔΩó
ek1ePFp-nBI,The real Baba Yaga. Jamie Lee Curtis might need the services of another Baba Yaga--John Wick.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So instead of Halloween story is an alternate ending where the doctor captures Michael and sends him back prisons for 40 more years
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bro this looks really fucking good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait...Laurie was killed, back in Resurrection...so is this non-canon?  Was Resurrection non-canon? Or are they just gonna come up with some BS way she survived being impaled through the back, and plummeting several stories from an asylum roof?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks lame
ek1ePFp-nBI,I been waiting for this too long
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:05 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a made up people made up‚Äù?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who the hell would make up that Laurie was Micheal's sister? They should of left that part out of the trailer and movie if they were not related. Because in the original 1981 sequel and the other movies after that, They ARE brother and sister. That is such bad writing to me and makes no sense. Why would Micheal pick Laurie out of all the girls in the town to stalk, Makes no sense and it makes more sense that he would stalk and try to kill his sister. Also is more emotional and powerful to both Laurie and Micheal and adds to their stories and is a reason why Laurie is so messed up cause her evil brother is after her. H20 did an amazing job with that. It was not just some random guy...It was her brother. This is just a different timeline the other movies are still canon and the 1981 Halloween 2 is still 1978's original sequel. I mean come on it takes place on the same night. Micheal and Laurie ARE and ALWAYS WILL be brother and sister."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looking forward to seeing this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,;)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seriously one of the most uninteresting series of horror movies ever made. Just stop.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This year is the 40 year anniversary of the original Halloween (1978), it would be neat if movie theaters did a double feature showing the original first then this one. One of the regrets I have is not seeing the original in a movie theater way back when."

ek1ePFp-nBI,People saying michael is too old to kill well he is immortal can't be stopped he is controlled by a devil he is possessed
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dumb that they ignored part 2 1981 and H20 from 1998...... They could've continued from H2O bz in the end she axed a paramedic instead Michael Myers ....and just of ignored Resurrection

ek1ePFp-nBI,Give me a break.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI don‚Äôt believe this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is the female Bruce Willis in this.. That would be bad ass to see Bruce Willis go up against Michael lol!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just once, I want a character to ask:  ""Have you considered removing his head?"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,What a letdown. The filmmakers and writers did nearly every single thing wrong in this. They didn't completely destroy JLCurtis. But they tried. So sloppy. So tired. So unimaginative. I wanted Michael to finish everybody off. Especially the young people. Shudder.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY CRAP JAME LEE CURTIS IS PLAYING LAURIE STRODE AGAIN
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This absolutely looks awesome and I can't wait. My only slight criticism was that final shot, I guess you could say that knowing he is there (because it's obvious) might be scary with context of characters we care about, but just from the trailer it seemed like a poor jump scare with an obvious build up.

Edit:
And hey just a thought, for all I know there could be a scene before this where we see Michael in the house already and we know he's about, or it could even be a clip not going to be in the film and whoever edited the trailer screwed the pooch (I mean, it happens sometimes). I do think it's important to have context of the full film before making a complete and final  judgement (I'd never not watch a film just based on the trailer), that's just my initial reaction."
ek1ePFp-nBI,ANYONE KNOW THE CERTIFICATE?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wished a jason movie came out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus good luck figuring out the continuity of this shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Guys be sure to check out Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee), tonight on Dateline. Dateline is doing a horror themed episode tonight and Jamie Lee will be discussing Halloween (2018). #Trick r Treat"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers hes coming for me AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA√ÄAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA√ÄAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA√ÄA√ÄAAAAAAAAAAAAA√ÄAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wish Laurie could take the shotgun to finish off Michael similar to when the Terminator finished off the T-1000 in Terminator 2, getting shot in the weak spot & falling into liquid hot metal."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stupid. John Carpenter keeps kicking a dead horse with this movie. Michael Myers is dead. Enough's enough already. Is movies were good in their time but it's over.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holllllllyyyyy
Shiittttttt
Holllllly
Shitttttt"
ek1ePFp-nBI,that piano creepy music...gets in my nerves...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where is Harry Potter?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do they spoil good parts like the ending of that scene just wait until the movie comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so scared. What if this movie is shit like the last one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nu este horror
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just hope Laurie Strode uses her three perks; Sole Survivor, Object Of Obsession, and Decisive Strike very wisely in this movie!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm freaking the FUCK out, I want this movie NOW."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who here purchased Dead by Daylight's dlc Halloween after watching this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,But how is she alive when he killed her in Resurrection?!?ü§îüòï
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait till the movie is out
ek1ePFp-nBI,H20 and Rob Zombie's remake....best viewed from the rearview mirror. Cannot wait for Oct. 19.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else got goosebumps when Michael put his mask on
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is the best horror movie of all time! The sequels remain awesome and don't get ridiculous like Friday the 13th! Long live Michael Myers!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm loving the fact in which they got Nick Castle (original 1978 Michael) to do some work with this one! This actually seems promising!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like a good movie 
Just every time I try to go watch a movie fkn teenagers are laughing and talking throughout the movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:20 Love how Laurie says MICHAEL ! That scene should be interesting
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:53-1:56 chills !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ive never felt more confident in somebody actually killing Michael than jamie lee curtis in this
ek1ePFp-nBI,What they have at least could‚Äôve done was include footage from the other films & set it as a nightmare sequence for Laurie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie Strode=the Sarah Conner of Haddonfield.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooo creepy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Somebody kill this man already damnüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,That creepy song never gets old
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I still prefer rob zombies halloween (2007) way more than any of the Halloween movies including this one, but this looks great"
ek1ePFp-nBI,ekim ne aq √ßƒ±kartƒ±n hadi
ek1ePFp-nBI,In Halloween 20 years later Laurie cut Michael's head off
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks promissor
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is the type of guy that when his girl texts him saying she's home alone he would still probably walk calmly lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael finally came out the closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting on this. I‚Äôve heard talked of another since like last year or something. I am so freaking excited. This looks so good! I can‚Äôt wait üòä
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, they're NOT siblings this time around?? Damn, that sucks... Pretty badass trailer though!! I'll definitely see it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I didnt even get through the wholr trailer. Im in my 20's and now I have to buy a night light.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I actually can‚Äôt wait for this!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANT WAIT !
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:43 whats that all about
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ummm she‚Äôs supposed to be dead... these movies don‚Äôt fucking match up üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I heard, that the same person who played Michael - is playing the part in this as well.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Haha they made the shape from dead by daylight into a real thing

I'm kidding"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""You don't believe in the boogeyman?""

""No.""

""You should.""

I love that whole line from JLC."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie will fail like Terminator Genesys did. You can't just make sequels and pretend the shitty ones before it didn't happen. Also if she waited for him  for 40 years why doesn't she have automatic weapons, plate vest carriers, improvised explosive devices, multiple high capacity hand guns and Hand to hand combat training You know.. like Linda Hamilton in terminator?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks terrible. I must watch it :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, they actually make his mask look really, really great! I feel like every movie since #2, the mask just didn't quite work."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why does the mask look like it aged horribly it even has forehead rinkles
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nicccceee
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs already August so they need to release a 2nd trailer for Halloween üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,A 61-year-old Michael Myers? seriously?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:54 he's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHEL MYRES
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After watching this trailer and seeing how badass Jamie lee. Curtis is and seeing how horrifyingly intense this is I want go in my room cry for three hours then watch this movie even though I will be scared to death then proceed to jump off a roof in agony yellin I'm scared.






Have a nice day:)







Oh shoot look behind you"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bro I‚Äôm Hyped asffff
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am i the only one who noticed Michael pulling out a knife at 1:29. Look very closely at the reflection in the fridge!
ek1ePFp-nBI,music 1:56??
ek1ePFp-nBI,How have i missed that the trailer for this has been out for 2 months?
ek1ePFp-nBI,what did you do to poor mike?!?!?!??!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Foreshadowing lesson n¬∞1 (for the younger audience) : answering ""No !"" to the question ""You don't believe in the Boogeyman ?"", in an utter confidence close enough from being considered some really misplaced arrogance, is punishable by the WORST possible upcoming death, based on the movie's point of view itself. Mark my words... That being said, the tension in this trailer really smells like Carpenter's signature ; we LOVE you Sir Carpenter, please be immortal !!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers back home
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where's my beer???
ek1ePFp-nBI,The first horror movie ill go to the cinema to see in fuck knows how many years
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im So confused on how Jamie Lee Curtis is still alive I thought Michael killed her
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be gory.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so HYPEEEE
ek1ePFp-nBI,And how come I‚Äôm the only one here that seems to notice this story line makes no sense whatsoever if she is already supposed to be dead!! He should be going after her son now not her
ek1ePFp-nBI,If they don‚Äôt explain that in this... they are totally off track with the Halloween story!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did she survive the attack when he stabbed her in the back and dropped her off the rooftop of the asylum she was in??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait a minute...ü§îHow are they bringing Laurie back if he killed her in Halloween resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,If I recall the only time I watch a movie at the theatre is a halloween movie michael Myers. Other than that I don't watch movies at theatre at all.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The real Halloween we been waiting for shit looks epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last clip she has a reaction time of a potato
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have been waiting for this movie for a while now. I was about to lose hope but when I saw this I loved it already. If Jason came out then this had to some time soon. I will wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandpa Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg Sounds amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks dumb
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why are trailers scarier than the actual movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years of Michael MyersüòÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lol if they all know Laurie then they all have Decisive Strike, what‚Äôs to fear?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie running around like Loomis, hell the revolver even looks like his."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is what I'm talking about
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks very promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Y'll ain't gonna kill me, bitches!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ohh, I see, so this is acting as a direct sequel to The night he came home. This movie get's rid of the time line and stories of the rest of the trilogy and just presents the story as if one happened straight after the other, so no H20 no Jamie Lloyd ark etc. Interesting. Probably what they should have did in the first place."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Melhor filme de terror! √ìtimo
ek1ePFp-nBI,dude him just chillin in the closet yessssssss just fuckin yessss like this movie is gonna be fucking amazing i love all horror movie scarier they are better it is for me !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Use Ultra Red Addon so you can easy to kill
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for it to come out
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúCan you close the closet door?‚Äù‚Äî-‚Äú Door doesn‚Äôt close‚Äù‚Äî‚Äî ‚Äú I shit my pants and jump out the window‚Äù ! 2:40
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who here is just playing as Michael Myers in Dead by Daylight in excitement for this film? I'm so Pumped :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers vs leather face or jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Where Laurie shot Michael look at the second window!! Ladies and gentlemen, we got a 2nd stalker!! And this scene gave me goosebumps!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I work in a mental asylum, and I'm SO SICK of independent documentary makers coming round and handing over masks/weapons/trinkets to my patients which leads them to regress and resume their maniacal killing sprees. It happens like every other week."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is a total retconn because Michael was not ""taken into custody"" at the end of Halloween 1, he simply vanished....."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The plot in the original is better this on is just dumb
ek1ePFp-nBI,Words cannot describe how stoked I am for this. By far my favorite horror series and seeing Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter together again is phenomenal. These next couple months of waiting are going to be torture
ek1ePFp-nBI,Need a new trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who would that the original Laurie Strode would play Another Laurie Strode almost 20 years later
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whose ready for Halloween ?üéÉüéÉüó°üó°üî´üëµüëªüëª‚ò†üíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,when that piano comes in right when it goes to the production titles i orgasm
ek1ePFp-nBI,...............
ek1ePFp-nBI,But didn't Laurie decapitate him in H20?!?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell yeah he will never die you can't kill damnation and that's what Michael is let's go baby more Halloween's to follow after this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where is Danielle Harris??????????

ek1ePFp-nBI,"the immortal michael myers

ek1ePFp-nBI,This Halloween is gonna be my best Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:49-0:58 Jurassic World music
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In the movie Halloween 2007 , she kills him in the end, i don't know how this makes sense, because she bursts his head sitting on his chest by a gun shot."
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THEY DISREGARD THE EVENTS OF HALLOWEEN 2?  THAT'S PLAIN SILLINESS!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Careful guys!the more he stalker the person,the faster he is and no terror radius even with scaredy cat perk."
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is not playing around at all
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im waiting for you...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wasn't she killed off already?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like the lady with glasses will either sacrifice herself to save someone or get killed trying to kill Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so ready XD
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can't kill Michael but with Jamie Lee curtis  back in this will be badass I loved when rob zombie directed it with the remake of 1 and 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie will kick so much fucking ass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:22 The babysitters hand at the end cause it matches her sweater
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Every person that is going to watch the movie in the cinema should fill out a questionnaire, onl y to find out how many of the guests want to see it because of Dead by Daylight :D"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for this film it scared the shit out of me in 1978 when i was  seven and I think it will now I'm 47 ü§§üò®
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Michael Myers and Laurie Strode are not brother and sister? Two thumbs downüëéüëé
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really don't understand the timeline of this movie tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will be the new highest grossing horror of all time !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So exited for this one my fav Halloween movie omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best killer but not in Robert Zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Really hope this movie kills it (no pun intended) so other horror classics like F13, Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream can come back as well!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is where Laurie the main person who survived and wanted to kill him becomes old and Michael Myers looks the same
ek1ePFp-nBI,2 Months!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:03 Michael reaches tier 3
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After Rob Zombie's remake I think this will fail in comparison, anyone agree?"

ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt until October !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how in the last clip he was the one in the closet haha
ek1ePFp-nBI,Tbh I clicked on this video because I thought the guy in the thumbnail was chancellor palpatine lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have been addicted to the entire Halloween franchise since its inception.  If this movie is half as good as this trailer, it is going to be epic! Go Michael Myers!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,59 sec. Jurassic park???
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this gives me what I want most... A proper death to the killer. Michael's true ending.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im back üòè
ek1ePFp-nBI,The master is back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait :(

ek1ePFp-nBI,My neice calls him michael Jackson
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fans of Halloween Drop a big thumbs up if you agree that Friday the 13 is nothing  compared to this movie üëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Theme song gives me chills..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes I love Jamie lee Curtis, and can‚Äôt  wait to see the movie, but I can‚Äôt see her acting as trying to kill her brother with guns, when she nor he used one before,, they only use knives"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Y'know it is bad when you hear ""three innocent teenagers"" and you think, ""that's it?"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Helen Tasker from True Lies is a mission to destroy the most epic iconic force of evil: Michael Myersüëçüëçüëçüëçüëèüëèüëèüëèüëåüëåüëåüëåüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä. I hope Sigourney Weaver comes back with the alien sequel like Jamie Lee Curtis did.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't they already remake this movie in 2007? Now they are making another reboot? Boy! Hollywood is running out of ideas!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait to see this movie in October, it looks really good and Jamie Lee Curtis is an amazing actress. I know this film will not disappoint, one of my favorite horror films of all time is back."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,the music sound like Jurrasic World
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hey BLUMHOUSE  aren't you going to help Scott cawtthon make five nights at freddy's the movie or not because it's  been like 2 or 3 years since you guys announced it
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YES!1!1!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder what Donald Pleasance would think of this?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder how they caught Michael since he disappeared after being shot at the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,He better not killed that kid that she is babysitting
ek1ePFp-nBI,You don‚Äôt believe in the boogie man
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do you guys now that that mental rehab that is a mibble school called military magnet whovk is by where i live which is in North charleston south carolina

ek1ePFp-nBI,How is Laurie/Kate still alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,CAN'T WAIT!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Keeping it sexy!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this movie is even going to ignore Halloween 2?  The trailer says he only murdered 3 teenagers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to watch the new Halloween movie üëÄ looks really really crazy and scary movie üëÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hi brother !

ek1ePFp-nBI,Its girl guys
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best movie for Halloween for me . Like !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,One word... Nostalgia
ek1ePFp-nBI,There is something powerful in the way she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve waited for him‚Äù.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if he will be driving in this one... Would be very 1978 and SO awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,When is it gonna come out??????
ek1ePFp-nBI,Somebody better repair a generator in this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg relly a new one
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie can end up in 3 ways 1.) it becomes a success and may be considered even better than the original. 2.) it flops and be considered even worse than the rob zombie remakes or 3.) it becomes divisive among fans of the series similar to how the last jedi is among star wars fans and if number 3 does happen i don't know if i will be on the hated side or the liked side though i liked the last jedi there's a possibility it will be the opposite side for the new halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,and they ignore Halloween Ressurection
ek1ePFp-nBI,That German Shepherd Dog is so cute.
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can see he is actually person so why doesn't he die michael you  better not have a bulletproof vust Jason doesn't:)
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:00 I mean at least he didn't kill the kid that's just rude
ek1ePFp-nBI,i'm coming home...

ek1ePFp-nBI,Guys didn't Laurie die in halloween ressuruction
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this is a direct sequel to the original.   Ok, at LEAST give it a DIFFERENT NAME of some sort?  This is going to confuse SO many people.  Ok, there ARE in fact two films with the identical same name called ""Friday The 13th."". Problem is one is an original and one a reboot.  This is NOT a reboot film, but being marketed as a direct sequel.  Wrong wrong wrong!  Then lets look at the  house.  All abandoned and run down.  Wont anyone notice if watching back to back it looks NOTHING like the one in the first film which this is supposed to be a sequel.  Lastly,  and i said this about ALL of the other films...if you want it to LOOK and FEEL like Illinois....why not FILM in Illinois?  This was filmed in the Carolinas from what i read and the first two obviously in California."
ek1ePFp-nBI,evil has no age limit

ek1ePFp-nBI,Hello what are you doing 2:35
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is going to die
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The trailer looks brilliant but I'm not so sure about the closet scene at the end,it just looks too predictable and takes away from the suspense..if its one of the kills/scares then why the fuck were they so quick to show it in the trailer? Maybe there's more of a twist to that clip than I realise I don't think they'd be as blatant to show one of the kills/scares in the trailer!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,When is the release date???
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!!!        Bring It!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You've fooled them, haven't you Michael? But not me"

ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so ready to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,So wanna watch Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think this is probably the same man tht player Mike in the 70‚Äôs-80‚Äôs cuz he isn‚Äôt as big as all the other mikes in the movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,In the list of must see of 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn the psychiatric facility is always fucking up
ek1ePFp-nBI,They need John Wick

ek1ePFp-nBI,To see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,You don't believe in the boogie man.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just call Jason he would whoop his ass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lame. Sad how John Carpenter's creation has become a B movie joke
ek1ePFp-nBI,"But like Dr Loomis said,"" he's not a man,he's pure evil"" that's what kept him alive."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Legend has it that Michael Myers was 21 years old in the original Halloween in 1978, which would make him 61 years now, AND he was killed at least once in every film,I guess the old saying holds true,takes a licking and keeps on ticking."
ek1ePFp-nBI,''Once upon a time in Chicago. Michael Myers walked in a irish bar and met Jason Voorhees........''
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did Michael escape like from the mental asylum? Again?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good but how many times are you gonna remake the same god dam movie?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,Tipically you taking a shit and Michael Myers fucking kills you
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god !! Michael myers still alive untill now !! But he will dead again and awaken back on upcoming years??

ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg can't wait for this I loved watching these when I was younger
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Part me is so stoked for this movie, and I will enjoy it.  The other part is a bit let down that some of the sequels that were actually pretty good didn't happen. :("
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike just needs snickers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How are they trying to make michael seem like he is not so supernatural as the sequels made him out to be since this is a sequel for the first one and as they said in the trailer michael was shot by Loomis. Loomis shot him like 6 time with a fucking revolver and as seen in the movie, every shot hit him since he was pushed back with every shot. Who the fuck can survive 6 shots from a revolver??? I hope to god that michael still is an unstopable killing machine in this one and not some pussy who can be put down by just a gun. Halloween's best thing is that the murderer is something more than human he is pure evil and they are trying to make him seem like just some mentally ill serial killer? Thats shit"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guess what‚Äôs my ringtone for calling?üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüòâ hehe guess who‚Äôs going to love this year?

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hold tf on, so if Michael killed Laurie already, then how is she in the new Halloween??"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"We're now at the point where whenever someone asks ""do you want to watch Halloween"", you basically need to respond with ""which one? The 1978 original movie, the 2007 reboot, or the 2018 sequel to the 1978 movie?"".

Couldn't have they called this movie ""Halloween 2""? How about ""Halloween: The Hunt for Michael Meyers""? How about ""Halloween Part 2"", or even ""Halloween: The TRUE Sequel""? ANYTHING other than just ""Halloween"", considering this movie is a SEQUEL to the original movie.

At least the naming of the 2007 reboot made sense, considering it was a reboot, not a sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,We‚Äôre here to investigate a patient that killed three innocent teenagers on Halloween in 1978
ek1ePFp-nBI,Out of all the horror movies I‚Äôve seen this one looks promising and not a shitty cash grab
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is my favorite movie and I've seen all Halloween movies like john carpenter and Rob zombie Halloween films and this is the 40th anniversary of Halloween franchise!
ek1ePFp-nBI,One Of the Best Slasher Films In History
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't like the consept...It's like making an alien 5 movie with Sigourney Weaver by  ignoring Alien 2, 3 and 4. It not works for me and I can't see the reaason of someone doing that except the money. Yes. H2018 will have a success and will bring them money. Because that is the case right?"

Michael: that‚Äôs strange sir, I have no recollection of that at all
Jack: mr Myers... you were the supernatural killer here.
Michael: I‚Äôm sorry to differ with you sir but you are the killer, you‚Äôve always been the killer, I should know sir, I‚Äôve always been here.
Did you know mr Torrence, that your son is trying to bring a outside party into this situation.
Jack: no
Michael: he is mr Torrence
Jack: who?
Michael: a hockey mask
Jack: a hockey mask?
Michael: a hockey mask and a machete
Jack: how?
Michael: your son has a very great talent, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre aware of how great it is. He is attempting to use that very talent against your will.

Jack: he is a very willful boy.
Michael: he is so indeed sir, a very willful boy, a rather naughty boy if I may say so bold sir.
Jack: it‚Äôs his mother, she, uh, interferes
Michael: perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don‚Äôt mind me saying so sir. Perhaps a bit more.
my niece didn‚Äôt care for Halloween at first, she actually stole a pack of matches and tried to burn it, but I corrected them sir, and when my sister tried to stop me from doing my duty, I corrected her too. 
Jack: ü§î"

ek1ePFp-nBI,That shot at 2:15 where the officer in the house and sees the ghost next to the fish tank; that's the bedroom in the final sequence of the trailer where Michael appears in the closet. (The comforter matches.)

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This would probably be the best Halloween movie because blumhouse has made amazing so far like truth or dare, get out. And they were amazing movies so I think thia would probably be the best halloween movie."

ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should make Michael Myers vs Jason Voorhees
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Blumhouse is involved, we have nothing to worry about."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a real trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People saying Michael is too old...HA. Look at the new pics, this might be his most brutal movie. And hopefully none of the shaky cam crap like in the Rob Zombie movies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maaan I dunno. I'm a 40yr old life long horror fan and I've seen more than enough of my fair share of remakes n reboots and have been let down over n over again so my faith in this beast isnt that high but I'd love to be proven wrong...
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:18 i kinda know that sound effect from a game
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now please...please can we have a new friday the 13th movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Still a shame that were ignoring halloween 2, that's a great movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Goooo Jaime!!!! Sooo proud of you, girl!!!üòòüëç‚ù§"

ek1ePFp-nBI,At 1:53 when Michael put on that mask its kill time üî™üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Judy Geer ruins movies no matter how good they are. She is the very definition of bad acting. She better die at the hands of Micheal Myers. Kill this bad actress for me Micheal Myers. 

Reason: She ruined Jurrasic World she played a bitch with no respect for her sister.

She ruined Ant Man, she played a bitch who married the cop that arrested Scott Lang. She only cared about money and her daughter. No wonder Thanos didnt snap his fingers at the worst people alive.

She will most likely ruin Halloween, she will play another bitch who thinks that her mother is insane. Dont ever insult Jamie Lee Curtis that actress was born to play in horror movies unlike Judy Geer she belongs in movies for braindead people. Movies in lower no the lowest budget possible in other words F Movies not B movies.

In laments terms she plays characters that bitch alot and are truly bitches."
ek1ePFp-nBI,NOOT NOOT
ek1ePFp-nBI,"She may have the ""accuracy"" to shoot but she most certainly does not have the strength to fight him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael showing the lady in the stall that he's a dentist (shh don't worry)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie is no longer relevant... ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg Is going to be the best horror movie everrrrr
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The movie has to end with Laurie dying 
No lie I like Jamie Lee Curtis though but Michael needs to win maybe it will help the sequel"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"We need Jigsaw, Jason and Michael as a squad"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope she survives this one again
ek1ePFp-nBI,The title should have been Michael Myers. Using Halloween for the 3rd time is redundant. Or Halloween Returns. Maybe Halloween Chapter II
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! QHY CABT THEY JYST PUT IT OUT NOW?; ITS AMAZING
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That knife flip at 2:03 it‚Äôs like Michel himself is saying ‚Äúya I‚Äôm back, and I ain‚Äôt screwing this one up‚Äù"

ek1ePFp-nBI,That tooth thing was so over the top try hard it's not even funny
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I personally think that they should not ignore Halloween 2 why "" she said it herself that she always known that Michael will return she had thay instinct feeling that Michael would return one day the ending of part 2 the face she made before you saw Michael in flames she knew it wasn't over it was just the beginning!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,it's not going to be the same without Donald plesance
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe I'm in the minority, but I'm kind of put off by the fact that they're wiping away a number of the films in continuity, including the last one that JLC starred in. Hope it does well, but I'm skeptical."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is the only horror movie that I know that could scare me even the first Halloween movie to the last one will throw me off
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is the Thorn Coven breaking Myers out of prison again that would be cool!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Universal Pictures üçøüçøüçøüç≠üç¨üç∞üéÇüç®üçßüç¶ü§°üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see this movie üôÇüôÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Same boring script, angry, bitchy woman underestimated by straight white males perseveres over an evil straight white male. YAWN!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg I cannot wait. Just hearing the music gave me chills
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am glad to see nick castle back just like old times
ek1ePFp-nBI,Alright Excellent I Love This Actual Sequel Of The Very First Halloween movie 1978 and Now It's Like 40  Later  from The Legend Again John Carpenter. Great THANKS So Much.
ek1ePFp-nBI,#Halloween2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fact -  In the original Halloween (1978) you never hear the words 'Michael Myers.'  

You hear ""Michael""  and ""Myers"".  But never together.  

He really is the shape. 

Who knew that...
 I do not include the extra scenes they shot for 1980s NBC Halloween obviously.  Only Carpenter's true classic."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"A franchise needs to b embraced, this is gonna b a new take on a icon,I'm so sick of people not letting a icon live such as laurie strode  and Micheal Myers, this maybe the final showdown"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Like the way Laurie has the same hair style as in the original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"it fucking irritates me the sequels are being ignored but anyway this does look good.  Considering it's a sequel to the original their attention to detail looks great with the dodgy eye and the hole in the mask.  But it may appear that way on the surface as when you dig deeper into this trailer Michael seems too exposed and not like in the original when he was there and not there, also in this trailer he kind of bumps into the kids but in the original he grabs the little kid and also in the original Michael escapes on his own when he is ready not by luck that's implied in this trailer.  They want to bring back the shape.  Good.  But please remember that Michael is the shape because of the fact he is so inhuman but we know he is human,  He doesn't speak, he is inhumanly patient, has insane strength for a normal size guy, can literally disappear in front of your eyes, eats dogs for nourishment and can take getting stabbed in the neck, eye and gut and get shot 6 times and not only does it not kill him but barely even slows him down.  

This is why he is the shape not just that he kills randomly, as lets face it that's something pretty much every serial killer has in their locker.  I hope they remembered this.  And for me Michael wanting to kill his bloodline was terrifying and unique.  Most family members of serial killers if not all are immune from their actions.  But in Michael Myers case they are the main target.  If you think Michael would not come after you cos you don't have Myers blood you are wrong.  In every Halloween film he stalks and kills randomer's before he goes after Laurie or Jamie.  (my particular favourite is H2 after leaving the elrods he notices and then stalks and kills alice) Carpenter wrote this and in the same film made them siblings.  So you see making them siblings actually made him scarier.  Haddonfield represents every town perfectly so regardless if he sees you then you have had it bloodline or not.  (young 17 females in particular lol)  Michael Myers has always been the shape until Zombie showed up."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can‚Äôt we just ship Michael Myers,Jason Voorheis, Freddy Krueger, The Alien, The Predator and the assholes from the Hellraiser movies off to a desert island someplace,let them get into a big fight and get this whole thing over with that much quicker?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So long since an 'original' one. Back to a good looking mask!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie is still scared by him, look at her face she is shocked as hell"
ek1ePFp-nBI,No other killer got nothing on Michael hands down if y'all ain't with me then fucc u
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael acquirers all peices of his suit including the mask at a convenient store.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I see this during the purge
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes! Laurie Strode was never Michael's sister, I love that they're sticking to that"
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 did he just say za warudo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else got the chills?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oommggg  is it a Remake Of The Old one Or What?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woah No way
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sounds like they need John wick...üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,The scene at the prison looks very well made. It sets an excellent tone early on.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fuckin shit I've been waiting for this for years!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like if this does good the guys who made this and produced it should  try and do Friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street but that's just my opinion
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm honestly not excited for this at all. I‚Äôm more excited for Slenderman than this and even Slenderman looks like garbage lmao.
ek1ePFp-nBI,DBD~~
ek1ePFp-nBI,XoXO...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't front. I was skeptical at first but this looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Their is no way around the supernatural with Michael,you don't survive getting stabbed in the neck with a big sewing needle,being stabbing in the eye with a wire hangar,stabbed in the chest and then shot 6 times."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of him. But I love watching the Halloween movies... I flinched at every move he made, and I had the volume sooooo low... in my head, if the music plays, his big scary ass is right around the corner! Lmao I can‚Äôt wait to watch!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg micheal myers back ! I love his movies growing up
ek1ePFp-nBI,MIKE IZ BACK I THOUGH SHE DIED IN THE FALL OFF THA. BUILDING HE NOT BULLSHITTIN EITHER JAHHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,"CANNOT WAIT!! Jamie Lee Curtis is a boss ass bitch, and hopefully she‚Äôll kick Michael‚Äôs ass. Definitely watching when it comes out üéÉüñ§üß°"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis better kill Michael for good this time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee gonna kicked his ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been promoting this movie like im getting paid for it üòÇ I've sent this trailer to many friends and family & id suggest you guys do the same. I really wanna see this movie do great!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Mickey Rourke mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Big Halloween fan but this looks stupid. Part 1 & 2 are the only good movies out of this saga
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow Jamie Lee Curtis is crazy why did she have a shotgun she said forget the knifes forget the running I'm coming after you might go here in my shotgun she said Michael of course Jamie lee look a hot mess in this one he's not supposed to look beautiful and this one was Jamie Lee cares is pretty I love her with the short hair when she was on that  activity she's pretty .H2O but the first one in 1978 or 77 I have to go see this

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:22 bye babbysitter so young
ek1ePFp-nBI,lost count of how many times ive watched this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Huh, so this is the timeline where the cops actually catch him after he got up from the ending of Halloween 1.

Neat idea."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:57 reminds me of Black ops 1 zombies music
ek1ePFp-nBI,where is this paul
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got all hot to that
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only pure evil character is kid buu
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, Laurie won't die just like Michael."
ek1ePFp-nBI,H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the old sound effects.
ek1ePFp-nBI,omfg !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Halloween... the night he came home, again...and it's not like the last time when it was the same night he came home... nor is it the time that was a do over of the night he came home.""
World's greatest tagline, it covers the entire poster, disowns the entire franchise. And it's probably for the best."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I did not know that I've been waiting to see Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween again until this. Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YEAH LAURIE, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TOO"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Have you guys heard the pingu sound at 0:45
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:38 it calls to him
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt lee Curtis cut off his head in h20 how the hell is he sill alive ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,MY CHILDHOOD FEAR IS COMING BACK
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is gonna be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"God does this movie look AWFUL! Only good Halloween was the original! .....but like MOST great movies, in the end Hollywood RUINS them by making TERRIBLE sequels or remakes!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is only gangsta Freddie Kruger and Jason are wack compared to Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Do you all 18+ people realize, what's happening? We're seeing Halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis in theaters. Why it's important, because last time Jamie Lee Curtis was in Halloween movie happened in 2002, I was myself 13 that year, so it means I didn't have any chance to see it in theaters, because I was too young. That will be fixed next Halloween XD."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who still remembers the breakfast sene?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the reaction from the patients and the dog when the guy holds the mask up to Michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,i love this film
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like the sister story arc. It makes more sense than him being just an evil insane human being who could be killed. Debra Hill and Carpenter wrote him to be emotionless, and unstoppable. Carpenter only wanted to do one Halloween, He got involved with Halloween 2 for legal contractual reasons. That's it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Still the scariest movie/killer ever to me, just the music alone sends chills down my spine."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have a feeling this is going to be a Cleveland Steamer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is the real deal.not fan made
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shouldn't Michael be in diapers by now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"...Please ...again?  Doesn't look like shit though... But what the fuck is canon and what the fuck is not? ...Last time I've seen Jamie Lee Curtis in this mess of a franchise, she literally kissed Micheal before he threw her off a goddamn roof! ...The same mental hospital roof she was institutionalized in because of HIM!  ...I like Rob Zombie's violent take and I don't think anything with ever beat that!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does he fucking age
ek1ePFp-nBI,I kinda like the new version of Michael Myers mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 I started jamming so hard
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""I prayed that he would burn in hell, but in my heart I knew that hell would not have him"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't believe they are gonna dispute the fact Laurie is Michael's sister
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúTake one last look Michael‚Äù - Kitty
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is basically a different halloween 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they show his child hood because the 2007 remake showed an interesting story of his childhood but the rest of the movie was shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Essa musica √© loka demais
ek1ePFp-nBI,Count me in lol but not by myself of course lol!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this Halloween H2.0?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know, when I first heard of this I thought it was gonna look awful with Jamie Lee Curtis being an old woman but I‚Äôll admit I was wrong, this looks pretty good, I‚Äôm excited!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait i love Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wouldnt Michael be in his 60's in this timeline? Come On!! Enough with this shit.....

ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a big Halloween fan but I didn't at all like Rob zombie Halloween 2 it  sucked & so did Halloween resurrection & curse of Michael Myers bad acting in those 3 but I've watched every Halloween flim since I was 6 years old and my all time favorite is Halloween 2 1981 and the original Halloween but I'm ready for this Halloween movie I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready. Eddie Eddie ready really excited. Because the original Laurie and Michael Myers are coming back

ek1ePFp-nBI,The Shape...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie Lee Curtis is 59 years old  I'm going to say that Michael Myers is 10 years older than his sister going by the appearance of young Michael in Rob Zombie's Halloween.  My point is Michael Myers has got to be around 70 years old. Still ""poking"" around pretty good I guess."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If all cinema owners are reading this...
Please do a back to back showing of the original followed by this on its release date or Halloween night itself üôèüèªüéÉ"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wonder if this occurs to anyone else besides me. I know this takes place after the 1st Halloween besides the other ones but I'm wondering... is Laurie's granddaughter 17, because Michael went after Laurie Strode when she was 17 from Halloween 1, especially her big sister Judith Myers at 17 from 1963 and in Halloween H20 Laurie's son John was 17. Also in the 1st and 4th Halloween each daughter of a Sheriff was killed by Michael Myers, will Michael Myers do the same thing on this one?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,In prison for 40 years? So are we just going to ignore ALLLLLLLLL the other Halloween movies.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Why would you show him the mask on the yard?
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM ACTUALLY SITTING ON THE TOILET SCREAMING RN üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*JUST FOR FUN: I think then entire Halloween franchise would have ended with a beautiful bang if only Halloween Ressurection was better. Should have gone like this: Laurie ( a.ka. Kerry Tate ) kills the wrong guy in H20, so she is institutionalized. The real Michael finds her but she escapes. The murders of the hospital guards are aired on the news and Laurie is blamed because she has escaped. Meanwhile...her son John ( from H20 ) heard of this and is worried. He has heard bits and pieces of his mother being the sister of a crazed murderer, but he does not pry. He wants to forget it all and has tried to distance himself. But he has more to worry about because he has been tracked down...not by his knife wielding uncle, but by a young man who claims to be his nephew,and the son of Laurie's first child, Jamie Lloyd ( remember in Halloween 6, Jamie has a child before she is killed by Michael ). The young man explains to John that he was raised by his adopted parents ( Lindsey Wallace and Tommy Doyle. Tommy, whom Laurie babysat in the first Halloween film, is reintroduced as an adult in Halloween 6 ). The young man explains to John that his adoptive parents rescued him when he was an infant, as he was left in a train station bathroom by his mother , Jamie, who was trying to protect him from his murderous great uncle. His birth mother , Jamie, was killed by his great uncle , Michael Myers. The young man explains that he found out Jamie was his mother due to asking his parents. It was determined,somewhere in the time frame of part six, before he was adopted, that he was the son of Jamie Lloyd. The young man also learns that his adoptive father, Tommy,  had a small run in with Michael as a child in 1978 (Michael stalked his babysitter, Laurie Strode a.ka. Kerry Tate). John is in disbelief, but the young man has documented proof of this. Right when John is ready to deny all of this, as he wants no ties to a family haunted by grisly murders, his own mother Laurie ( Kerry ) finds him. She is dirty and shaken up from being on the run. John then questions his mother, informing her that the young man with him is her grandson, the child of her daughter Jamie; a daughter that she never talked about. John asks his mother why she kept his sister a secret.¬†Laurie explains that she gave up her daughter Jamie for adoption and faked her death because she was afraid Michael would come after her again. when this was done, she cut off all ties and was not aware that she had a grandson, or that her daughter was dead. The young man tells John and Laurie that he has always felt he had family elsewhere, and that he also felt like his life was always in danger, which drove him to track them down. Now that the family reunion has occurred, it is brought back to focus that Michael is still after Laurie, and so is the law. So Laurie, her son John, and her grandson (son of Jamie) all band together to end this family curse once and for all.

P.S. I CANT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wasn't laurie stuck at the entity's realm?
ek1ePFp-nBI,i need to stop rewatching this or i will get to hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh My God
ek1ePFp-nBI,ESSE VAI SER LOUCO
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OMG, this is a gaggg! Jamie Lee Curtis is still acting as Laurie Strode and this trailer is so fckingggg awesome! But if she dies, i'm gonna be so depressed."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Even tho I am hyped about the film not making him her brother IS SHIT. The reason Michael kills is because he wants to kill his bloodline. Why does he want to kill know ???? Also I heard a rumor that says that he is not supernatular in this one and that he can get killed. Is that true ????? Is he also missing his eye ??? Because in the first he got stubed in his eye. The sequel ignored it however.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've never seen the other Halloween movies. So I'm confused.is this a reboot or like a continuation of the other movies??
ek1ePFp-nBI,He 51 years old now?wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this a sequel to the original movies or the newer movies or is it just a completely new one???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks just like Halloween 2's mask. Wouldn't doubt that it is
ek1ePFp-nBI,How does 9.1k losers dislike this video. Must be Friday the 13th fans
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Halloween about to be Lit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great. Throw a John Carpenter cameo in the film and I will die happy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Tyler mane was a bigger taller scary looking Michael Myers , he should have been the actor for this movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,9.1K people prefer the Zombie Halloween to the real deal.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good ol myers is back but his head was chopped off 20 years ago and if it ignored h20 he still escaped in 1 and burned in 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,I FUCKING screamed at the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The crazy part is that it's being released on Michael Myers birthday!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Oh*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see that movie I already met the actor who played Michael Myers in the original Halloween movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am excited to see what they do with him in this. Seems like we see alot more of the mask rather than Michael being ""the shape"" which we all saw alot of in the 1st film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jame lee is rootin tootin ready for shooting
ek1ePFp-nBI,Eu so estou aguardando outubro quando o filme lan√ßa
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude this actually looks amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The best part is that I've seen all the halloween movies now I'm just waiting to see this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,In my opinion I think the guy who pulled out Michael‚Äôs mask should be played by Benedict Cumberbatch
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think the killer is the guy in the white mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is it just me, or does this trailer make you poop your pants"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, somebody help me.¬†¬† Where does common sense come into play with¬†this?¬† The first Halloween I get it, but why is he still alive????¬† Did I miss something, has someone else taken over the mask?¬† I love Horror movies, but come on."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*u√© Mas a irm√£ dele n√£o havia cortado a cabe√ßa dele?* Ele √© imortal √©?  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mas adoro esse filme, √© um dos melhores do g√™nero."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should have brought back Paul Rudd and had full continuity.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Girl:*runs
Michael:*walks
Michael *catches up to the girl"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You guys should check out Patient X's cover of the Halloween theme, its badass!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Me and my daughter have a date, planned in advance yep"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here' what i've noticed so far, the woman in the restroom was the woman from the very beginning of the trailer that was with the other guy, the guy had michael's mask in his bag, now if you check frame by frame at 1:48 you can see michael slamming the guy's face into the stall and killing the woman, so what i'm saying is the two people at the beginning are dead (big effing spoiler tho) the teeth michael dropped in the bathroom were the guy's and then he takes the mask from his bag and puts it on."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm guessing the girl in the gray shirt is Laurie‚Äôs daughter
ek1ePFp-nBI,How about the title will be called Halloween: Strode VS. Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,If American horror story had a movie üçøüé•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Algum Br?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"SPOILERS!!!!!






somebody dies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs going to kill Laurie‚Äôs granddaughter‚Äôs friend... look at 2:22 and then look at 2:29 same long sleeved yellow shirt ...üò©üò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,"üé∂This is halloween, halloween halloween halloween üé∂"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:54........ michael Myers: ‚Äúfine, I‚Äôll do it myself, puts mask on. Thanos would be proud."
ek1ePFp-nBI,MY TWO ADORABLE SIBLINGS are COMING!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,can we just have this movie now PLEASE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,@ 2:35 *When it's 2018 and Micheal Myers came out of the closet*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee Curtis tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,I will be the first to watch this movie at the theatre and dressed Michael pretty lit huh wish me luck not to get arrestedüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,whose here because of Dead By Daylight?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For these people who don‚Äôt get it, there are 4 universes of Halloween:
1.H1,H2,H4,H5,H6,
2.H1,H2,H20,Resurrection
3.Halloween 2007 and 2009
4.H1,Halloween 2018
This is why Laurie is still alive, this is why Laurie isn‚Äôt the sister of Michael.
The film producer didn‚Äôt want them to be siblings because then he would have a REASON why he wants to kill her.
Halloween 2018 ignores all Halloween films except of Halloween 1978. It‚Äôs like H20 and Resurrection, both ignored H4,H5 and H6."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This honestly looks like it's going to be good! :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween live wallpaper üëâ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technology.HighTeach.Halloween2018HDWallpapers
ek1ePFp-nBI,its basically a continuance with a twist!! Jamie lee curtis is rocking the pistols like a pro!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Exactly 3 months
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cannot wait!!! :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,If I see this my mom would be scared as hell
ek1ePFp-nBI,They've shown more of Michael in this trailer than expected.
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY a real Halloween film without dumbass Rob Zombie. Thank God
ek1ePFp-nBI,idk guys.. not really feeling it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome return
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this movie ignores ALL the movies after Halloween 2 correct?  Or is H20 still in continuity here?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers has always instilled fear in me ever since I was a terrified child that was too scared to walk down a darkened hallway, and I always had to look behind the shower curtain before using the bathroom. This movie ignores every sequel and goes back to the original that started it all. I, for one, can't wait to once again get the shit scared out of me this Halloween. üò®üéÉüò±"
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Quando √® prevista l'uscita di questo film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,halloween 3 season of the witch is a good movie but is not a michael myers movie. from original concept  john carpenter wanted to do a different halloween story each year but people don't have love the fact michael myers was not in movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yea i cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He couldn't kill her on Halloween in 1978, he's waited 40 years to finish what he started and now he's coming for her."
ek1ePFp-nBI,SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!! I CANT WAIT.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"in my hometown Pasadena, CA!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,esse filme vai ser √©pico
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:22 just briefly you can see the hole in the mask where Jamie stabbed him with the knitting needle from the 1st one... goosebumps
ek1ePFp-nBI,AAAAWWW Hell yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear I try to peice all of the Halloween sequels together and I can't each one strays away from the last one ü§î and has nothing to do with how it ended TF stop playing with my mind üò°
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When he twirled the knife to face backwards in his hand, you knew he meant business! Stayed in shape for over 40 years... good for you Michael!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The rob zombie mask was the best hands down
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who else is watching this 10 and under years old?
I did because my family said that Halloween was their favorite horror movie in the 1900‚Äôs and told me that there will be another movie!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I so want to watch this it is going to be lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Love
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween yet? 

https://youtu.be/ee8QZWNaY30"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is movie life finally getting back better#
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I LOVED that closet scene.  I totally thought when she turned around he'd be behind her and nail her.  I didnt expect him to be in the closet LOL.  That was a good scare, actually.  See the best horror movies are the ones who dont do the ""usual scares""  Like we expect him to be behind her, she turns around, and he's there.  But these gys are like no, Im gonna put him right in front of you - watch how."
ek1ePFp-nBI,First jigsaw now this every franchise is getting rebooted
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ow he'll yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People comparing Michael to Jason/Freddy etc:

What you have to realize is that anyone can rip guts out of people, and in some movies in a clich√© overdramatize manner ..that makes them memorable..  like in Feddy with the whole ceiling kill. BUT Halloween was successful and became a cult film (with educational value) because it didn‚Äôt rely on a strange origin story or gore and kills. He is just a man and there are very few kills in the original. It is more about Michael‚Äôs voyeuristic qualities, his simplicity only using a mask and a basic kitchen knife, he doesn‚Äôt rely on long scary chases, there are no big boobed gals he goes after, and he‚Äôs not killing because he‚Äôs angry at someone (real targeting); he is a single minded animal (as stated in one of the films) so his kills are not grand, but effective and raw. Michael is a someone that can happen anywhere, at anytime, to anyone. The existence of Michael makes you look over your shoulder, to make you feel that someone/anyone is watching you, thinking about you, and you can‚Äôt tell. To remind you that there are in our reality human beings ‚Äòserial killers‚Äô with such a similar minds- Like most of them Michael just chose ‚Äúsomeone who was there‚Äù & we really don‚Äôt know why. He is simple, but he is the Epitome of Pure Inhuman Evil.

That‚Äôs what makes him terrifying and memorable."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this the Jamie Lee Curtis from My Girl?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,mr Carpenter thank you sir..what a living legend
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hessss backkkk
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It looks not scary because i can predict whats going on. In the older,  more original halloweens, it was unpredictable"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just an FYI: the mask, worn by Michael Myers, is of James T. Kirk(Star Trek)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike Myers and Captain Kirk are BAACCCKKKK!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If Halloween 1978 is the only continuity, and all the other films are to be ignored, then what would be his motivation to kill Laurie Strode after 40 years then? Unless his brain is stuck in a time loop and he's fixated on finishing what he started in 1978. Why even come home in 1978 after killing Judith Meyers his sister in 1963? Nothing about this reboot is making any sense. Serial killers follow certain paterns. This movie makes no sense and I haven't even seen it yet. The hype surrounding this movie is off the charts crazy. I want to see it, but at the same time I have my doubts about how it is going to play out."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only good reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG QUEEN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks bad ass can‚Äôt wait to watch it Jamie Lee Curtis looks amazing glad she is in it she was always the best I wish Jamie aka Danielle Harris was in this movie that would of been awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm Confused In Halloween H20 Didn't She Cut His Head Off At The End ??, Or Was That A Fraud ? I'm Lost üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot wait to see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!! I CANT WAIT üòçMICHAEL I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!! IM YOUR #1 FAN LOL I'VE SEEN ALL
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I haven't seen any of the Halloween movies before, which ones should I watch before this one?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"can someone be nice enough to explain the story of previous movies and how it links to this? :)))
I just recently watched Halloween II (2009) Director's Cut but I still cant understand sht ;-;"
ek1ePFp-nBI,EPIC
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my. I've patiently waited on this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will it be rated R
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee curtis is back !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micachal meryers
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:26 the best part lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers is a government experiment, to depopulate the planet. Every time he is killed, the government reclones his dna. That's the part that they will never show you, cause that's they mysterious element of Myers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Looks So Good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i like that moment at :50 - i can name that tune in one note!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hopefully, Laurie kills Michael once and for all in this one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it looks like they are going to play around with the idea that Michael is a figment of her imagination. Or at least that's the vibe I'm getting. Any theories?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They should pull a grind house if this film is ignoring every sequel. Halloween 1978, 40 minute break, Halloween 2018"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Movie release 3 days before my
 B-dayüëè"
ek1ePFp-nBI,CADE OS BR ???
ek1ePFp-nBI,It look like a Leather face rival..but I don't know
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessss can't wait to see this. The trailer gave me chills....
ek1ePFp-nBI,I push the fuck outta that liked button
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Meyers & Blumhouse productions ! ! !  LITTY #Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I used to always see Michael Myers behind trees when I was riding my bike as a kid etc
The fact she took aim and shot at that window = ultra realism ha"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"if the movie make that Halloween 2018 is the 40 years later of Halloween 1978 it will be like this
there is some stupid things that if that night he was shot and captured for 40 years so the name ""Michael Myers"" was not the name that strikes fear to other psycho guys around there and Laurie will not familar with his return and in 1978 she did not know his name is and she will not prepare for this halloween night like this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why the fuck would anyone be shitting in that nasty ass toilet on the side of the road
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait for this movie I'm excited bringing back of my childhood üòèüëÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt fucking wait woo my favorite boogeyman
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's good to see an old friend again his been gone for to long
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie can not get here fast enough
ek1ePFp-nBI,The MM mask! They're FINALLY getting it right!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i want it so badly...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really think they will kill each other to conclude the story. They're both way too old to do another one lol. 
I'm excited af!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:03 that momment you reach Evil Within 3..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""It was the boogeyman!"" - Laurie Strode"
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 plot twist. He still in the closet to this day.. üåà
ek1ePFp-nBI,Terminator 2 vibes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait to see this but it is not going to be nearly as good as the first one. The original Halloween is in a class by itself. Nothing has ever come close to it and nothing ever will. The movie had everything that makes a perfect horror movie. The acting, directing and camera work was brilliant. This movie is still one of if not the best horror movies of all time. Simply genius."
ek1ePFp-nBI,...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After a dreadful Halloween Eve, Laurie Stode suffers from PTSD. Dr. Loomis and others think relaxation and recreation is key. Reconnection with nature might just help Laurie. She is sent to a camp by the name of Crystal Lake. Mikey soon finds out and heads on over only to meet his one true match."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"First Friday then elm street, then chucks, now Halloween? The trios just keep coming"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The best killer üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 is she Miranda Sings :D

ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve watched this trailer at least a dozen times
ek1ePFp-nBI,Garbage
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have faith in this film and I just know it will satisfy me
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Huh so there's something that I've always wondered. We already know that Michael can't die, but can he still age like a normal person? Or is he immune to that as well?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many different versions of this movie can there be? Give it up already. Hollywood has lost all their original ideas because they've been made over a thousand times. Fuck Hollywood
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really good hopefully shit aint cheesy
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 do i hear: NOOT NOOT?ü§£
ek1ePFp-nBI,Scary!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this takes place in the original movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Pray to god it‚Äôs actually good, not like what Hollywood movies have become today"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OMG, I CANT WAIT!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis 59 Years Old but still a bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone who thinks this is gonna be good is fucking retarded
ek1ePFp-nBI,That music ! I missed it !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,a  new movie coming?
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES !!!! Ben Traimer is still alive .üòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So is this like a reboot, a follow up to part 5 where he doesn‚Äôt break out of jail or what?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait to see this, I grew up watching the original I hope they don't foul this one up."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers is The Shape, but he has a couple distant cousin's that are killer's too. A matter of fact, Michael Myers comes from a long line of Shapes. 

His first cousin kills people but he disguises himself so that he looks just like their twin  doppelganger of the person he is trying to kill. His name is Ed and he is nicknamed, ""The Shape Of You"" 

Michael's other killer cousin is named Fish and he is an excellent swimmer who likes to seduce and  kill women in and around bodies of water. He carries the nickname, ""The Shape Of Water""

üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking awesome I love the Shapeüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow Cool Trailer‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah, Nick Castle is pretty old right now. I'm glad he's still active like this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have very high hopes cuz Blumhouse are involved and they‚Äôre known for making good movies with low budgets
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahh when is the last time I've hunted me cheap dreams hmm I really don't remember (I'd kill leatherface instead)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks fucking great, imo"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So who wants to go with meü§îüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm gonna high when I see this üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I understand how people say "" You can't f*ck with the original""  but I feel like Rob Zombie's version was just as if not better than the original and you have to really ask yourself. If this movie came after the original first 2 films done by John Carpenter where do the other films fall into place....perhaps I'm overthinking it but there is so many questions left unanswered. For example if H20 and Resurrection ""NEVER HAPPENED"" then why is Jamie lee Curtis in those as his sister in those 2 movies. It really gets your brain pumping and juices flowing. I feel this well still be a great film however I don't feel it will make sense being as though she played in both H20 and resurrection ""AS HIS SISTER""."
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:22 Lenin is in the movie ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now THIS is a Michael Myers movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,From this trailer I already know that the guy that shows Michael his mask died lol it‚Äôs his head being slammed into the bathroom stall an probably his teeth that Michael sprinkles like pixie dust üòÇ but this movie looks great
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So... Halloween 2,4,5,6, H20, resurrection... they didn't exist?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear if turns out like jeepers creepers 3 did I'mma be pissed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait üòçüòçüòçüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don‚Äôt get why he never just comes for her gotta kill 50 people in the meantime lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,Id like to see Christopher Nolan direct a horror movie üçø
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good trailer but Halloween is sooooo rinsed. After Jason X üôä it‚Äôll never be the same
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't he kill her in Halloween: Resurrection!?  Stabbed her in the back then dropped her off from the hospital roof!?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie was killed in resurrection? Unless this movie completely disregards every Halloween movie made? Or did she just not die?
ek1ePFp-nBI,dis shit bout to be dope
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don`t suck like IT. PLEASEEEE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Many horror creatures/killers, so many good ones, every so often one out of the many creatures/people are chosen to see what they‚Äôve got up their sleeve this time,this time Micheal has been chosen, and he‚Äôs here to take back HalloweenüíÄüéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This makes no sense because Michael killed Laurie Strode by stabbing her after they both went over the edge of the roof of the sanitarium and she fell to her death in Halloween: Resurrection. And after 40 years of Michael being Laurie's brother throughout the entire storyline,  NOW that's not true ?!? It was ""made up""?!?  Hollywood will do anything to rehash an old story and tell it differently....even bring people back from the dead and change identities of people after 40 years."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"THIS looks like a ""we've learned from our mistakes movie"". Calling it now 2nd to the original!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie is scary af üò®üò±

ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope it's as good as the trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now all we need is a Freddy or Jason Voorhees movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINISH HIIIM!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks sooooo bad ass. I love the shot of Michael flipping the knife. I see Judy Greer is still continuing her quest to be in every movie/tv show ever made.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Frickin camping killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still waiting for a new Friday the 13th film
ek1ePFp-nBI,Would they really not execute him after killing all those people just because he‚Äôs crazy? I understand not wanting to execute a mentally ill person but there must be a line
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is a fucking BEAST
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anyone know if John Carpenter is directing the new movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let's not forget, BEN TRAMOR IS STILL ALIVE IN THIS UNIVERSE"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm hoping Laurie gets revenge and kills Michael this time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks so good it would suck if it flopped
ek1ePFp-nBI,One word... EXCITED!!! üòÜüíØ‚úåÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Those two amateurs have no idea who or what they're dealing with. Why would you show him his mask? All you did was make him angry. Idiots. You should've left him alone. Now he's back and now he must be killed. We've all waited for you Michael and now it's time to finish you once and for all.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can someone answer this?:

Is the woman in the beginning with the headset the same woman in the bathroom stall?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,she back 0:02
ek1ePFp-nBI,I so have to see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,the hand was showing the lady who was trying to close the closet door
ek1ePFp-nBI,Go follow Jason Blum on Twitter :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,espero no hagan otra pelicula de mierda.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The fans still want a Michael vs. Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally! A reboot that doesn't actually look trash and actually enjoyable unlike rob zombies ones where it's LITTERALLY A MOVIE TO FALL ASLEEP TO
ek1ePFp-nBI,When a trailer gives you goosebumps you know the movie will be good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,No thanks
ek1ePFp-nBI,October 19 here I come
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait for this!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look out. There's bullsh*t about. Mehehehahaha. üëªüòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm glad to see John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle back."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael has become a legend. Far better than Freddy and Jason and better than any other ones out there. What makes Michael so scary is that he's tough and intelligent at the same time and he never says a word. He keeps coming after you no matter how long it takes. Michael is the original Terminator. It's very difficult to stop him and he has never died. I think he will in this one. 40 years of these movies is long enough. It's time Michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay. Here's how it goes. Michael Orby Myers was born on October 9, 1957 in Haddonfield, Illinois. When he was 6 on Halloween night in 1963, Wynn whispered in his ear to kill his family. He knew that the curse of thorn was already on him because he put it on him when he was born along with the mark. It went into effect that night when he whispered in his ear outside and it also made him mute. He killed his older sister Judith that night and was sent to Smith's Grove mental institution where he stayed for 15 years. Loomis was his psychiatrist and he tried to warn everyone about Michael but they already knew because they were all in on it. Michael knew that when he was 21 he would be tried as an adult and that he would have the strength to escape. He did so on October 30, 1978 and the next night went on his first killing spree in Haddonfield. He knew that Laurie was his little sister because she had come to visit him once. He failed to kill her because Loomis stepped in and saved her life. He was stabbed 3 times, shot 13 times and set on fire in an explosion before he fell and was stopped. If they would have let him burn he would have died right then and there. That's how you kill him. But they let him live and he spent 10 years in a coma at Ridgemont Sanitarium. Then they moved him out on October 30, 1988 and he escaped again. Meanwhile, Laurie had 3 children and moved to California with her son and one of her daughters. She left Jamie behind to carry on the family name in Haddonfield. Michael went after Jamie, failed to kill her and got filled full of holes. He spent another year in a coma, woke up and went after her again. He was captured but when set him free. They kidnapped Jamie and Michael raped her and get her pregnant. She and the baby escaped, Michael found her and killed her. Went after the baby and failed to kill him but killed Loomis, Wynn and everyone at Smith's Grove because he learned about what they had done to him. He knew Laurie was still alive and spent 4 years looking for her and going after her to end up stabbing her at her own mental institution where she was for killing an innocent man. He thought he killed her but she survived. He battled her in California and then again in Haddonfield then he went home and killed most of his Intruders. He was eletrecuted and burned in his garage but not enough to kill him. He laid there on the table, opened his eyes and groaned and now he has spent the last 15 years in a mental institution and Laurie has spent the last 15 years preparing to face him once again. She has her daughter and granddaughter left. Michael will be 61 when he escapes again and it's time to finish him once and for all. Disregard the Rob Zombie movies. Michael, your time has come and your reign of terror is over."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Going to be amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Used to think that he was actually the boogyman. Scared me shitless that movie. ~Credit to my mother making me watch horrors at the age of 5 üôåüíÄüò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last scene was 2 much 4 me ;-; but i live micheal...butvhe scared the sh*$^ out of me xD
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie strode keeps coming back from the dead! That's crazy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks pretty dope, but that part at the end looked so stupid."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtf this is not the storyline. She killed him in Halloween H2O and she had a son not a daughter.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay. Here's how it goes. Michael Orby Myers was born on October 9, 1957. When he was 6 on Halloween night in 1963, Wynn whispered in his ear outside to kill his family knowing that the curse of thorn was already on him because when he was born Wynn put it on him along with the mark. It went into effect that night when he whispered in his ear. He killed his older sister that night and went to Smith's Grove for 15 years. He knew when he was 21 that he would be tried as an adult and that he would have the strength to escape. He did so on October 30, 1978 and the next night went on his first killing spree. He knew Laurie was his little sister because she came to visit him once. Both of their parents were dead at this point. He failed to kill her. Loomis saved her life. Stay tuned. More to come."
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck yeah lets do this leroy sanchez
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How to make this sh**
1. Make it Halloween 
2. Make kids go trick r treating
3. Everything else in the trailer was a lie and bullsh**
Congrats you made a crappy movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie: Do you belive in the boogey man?
Me: Yea I played the game"
ek1ePFp-nBI,dis the shitt yall
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have been a really big Halloween fan my concern is that this movie won't make sense on why he stalked Lori from the first movie and how he got shot 6 times and got up and walked away just so they can say oh by the way we caught him when they were never around at the end of the 1st movie. They should of done just remake the first to set up this 1 to make sense.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Zapowiada siƒô spoko
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm still watching this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wonder if Michael myers is Mike myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dr. Loomis R.I.P.  We all miss you.
ek1ePFp-nBI,ha the starting when they all start to laugh when the mask comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow Michel Myers broke someone teath
ek1ePFp-nBI,"With Jamie Lee Curtis it will give you that intense seat grabbing feeling like the first original Michael Myers. I know that whoever is playing this Michael Myers will be awesome because Jamie Lee Curtis is back in the movie, and she want dare stand for a fake non scary Michael. I just hope that the teenage girls and small kids make it more appealing like that first original Halloween. This is John's last and final so I can tell he's putting a lot into this to give it his last bang of scare. As you can see as well this Michael Myers is not as tall as the new Michael Myers that came out on DVD instead of the movies which I didn't care for. This Michael is the same size and height as well as the child like mind phases, as the original first Michael which is awesome and what fans miss. I know this one will be really good!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I drunk or does the mask keep changing up in this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I been waiting for ever hope they got midnite showings in my areaüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People are really going to be shocked about Michael and Laurie not being connected. It's one of those twists that have become so well known that people tend to forget that it was never mentioned in the first movie.
I'm glad that this one scrapted it again, since I always thought it as a scarier idea that Michael just went after some random girls he saw on the street."
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs waited for this night he‚Äôs waited for me
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt waittttt team myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,That music üòò
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 2 was a shit movie .. But i have lot of expectation in this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Litterally can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'M CUMMIIIING
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone who's interested, stay tuned and I'll explain how all of them go together. Not right now. I'm going to bed but I will explain later."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Movie looks sick, let's hope they are able to explain and keep the audience attention"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This will be the most epic battle ever
Laurie strode vs Micheal myers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is the name of the actor that plays the reporter
ek1ePFp-nBI,I actually like h4 5 and 6. They were creepy and dark. H20 was good but Michael didn‚Äôt have the creepy and strong look as he did back then. Even the mask and customs. Almost cheap looking and the actor who played him didn‚Äôt have a good posture or wrong build. I don‚Äôt know it felt totally like it wasn‚Äôt Michael but some other man pulling pranks on Laurie and her son. Or an old Michael who‚Äôs grown weaker. Look up the comparisons in photos if you need to. H resurrection which sucked had Michael looking a bit more scary. The ONLY thing that was good of resurrection was the beginning and how it explained how he survived H20. But I hated Laurie dying.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love the stinger
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween costumes
http://www.myfancycostumes.com/news/Halloween-Onesie.html"
ek1ePFp-nBI,im a kid but i dont care if  i see this movie cause i love horror movies ive seen the new it movie and i cant wait for it chapter 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie is back!! Pls bring back the old horror.. I like the fact that she's fighting back and not running away..
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this movie....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"DONT MAKE HIM TALK 

*COUGH COUGH*
2007"
ek1ePFp-nBI,October 19th is my bday
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that his sister he wants at the end?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Chills every time Laurie and Micheal see each other through the window and Micheal with the head tilt.  Nick Castle (the original shape) played that part specifically in this movie.  Idc if they aren't siblings in this movie.  Laurie and Micheal have a history regardless of what the movie timeline is trying to tell me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this new reboot  is making Myers human now!  Rob Zombie did that how did that work out?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lame- zero references to Halloween 2- lame
ek1ePFp-nBI,October 19th it's Liit!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jame Lee Curtis died in the last one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well since it‚Äôs ignoring the other movies ...he kinda only killed about 3 people right ..which is kinda taking his ‚Äúbadassness‚Äù away ...if that makes sense
ek1ePFp-nBI,Checkerboard floor= Freemason signature
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,yeah but does busta rhymes electrocute Michael in the nuts with his sweet kung fu?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The new haloween theme is probably my favorite
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait are just gonna forget about Halloween 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,If michael and laurie arent brother and sister then why is michael targeting her?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks awesome. But I would love to see Blumehouse make a Friday the 13th movie. With masterpieces such as Paranormal Activity and Get Out, I would love to see their take on the F13 series."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks So GOOD!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie Vs Michael 
Who's gonna survive ?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOPEFULLY MICHAEL DOESNT KILL LAURIE THIS TIME .üòî SHE'S THE QUEEN !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait to see this movie and with Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) its gonna be better. This time I hope she can kill him for good üòä
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM LOVING this new stopping and starting during scenes of ‚ÄúLaurie‚Äôs Theme‚Äù. I LOVE IT! I love it‚Äôs the same original Sheriff Brackett! :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,What happend to him being big!?!?!? He was better big
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt victor Crowley already kill Jamie lee Curtis? Hatchet vs Halloween vs Friday the 13th vs nightmare on elm street?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To All who have all the Halloween Collection, minus the first,  BURN THEM!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,She will suck! Miss Hollywood loves to suck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they use the original theme in this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,A great way to forget the other movies is to find a creative way to play them off as dreams. Everyone has weird and crazy dreams.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When Michael Myers was 6 years old he stabbed his sister to death. For years he was locked up in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, but he escaped, and sudenly, Halloween üéÉ became another word for mayhem... One by one he killed his entire family until his 9-year-old niece, Jamie Lloyd, was the only one left alive. 29 years ago Halloween night, Michael & Jamie vanished and her body soon discovered as well as her new born child left in a station bathroom. Michael is still missing. Many people believe him to be dead, but I think someone hid him away after the noise. Someone who keeps Michael, protects him, tries to control him and if there's one thing I know you can't control evil. You can lock it up, you can burn it, bury it and pray that it dies, but it never will, it just rests a while. You can lock your doors and say your prayers at night but the evils out there, waiting. And maybe, just maybe, it's closer than you think....."
ek1ePFp-nBI,At 2:07 you can spot kids running in the Halloween 3 (silver shamrock) masks
ek1ePFp-nBI,theres something awfuly wrong with this picture he killed more like 300 people and his niece Jamie Lloyd and even Jamie lee Curtis died on an episode with busta Rhymes in 2002 she fell like 100 feet to her death wow fishy movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Click my face bubble and it'll take u to my rapping website
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really what to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I believe this will be the second best Halloween film to the original of course, but I‚Äôm kinda worried since Blumhouse is producing this and they have been in talks to unite every film they made or produced into a shared universe of sorts which raises questions such as will they connect this Halloween and the original to other films such as The Purge, Insidious, Sinister, Happy Death Day, Truth or Dare, The Green Inferno, etc. which makes me concerned due to the fact if they do connect this into their shared universe then they might put all of their other films‚Äô stuff into this, but either way I‚Äôm still very excited for this film and will love it no matter what (except if they put the Cult of Thorne stuff into it again and giving Michael Myers motives for coming after Laurie and her friends in a very absurd and disrespectful manner)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I only know so much of Michael Myers and I really wanna understand this movie so can someone help a brother out and let me know which movies (in order, but I remember watching Halloween 2) to watch so I can understand the background of Michael?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is there any real Micheal myers fans out there who loves him the way a do he ain't gonna die trust me Laurie wil die ma dad is 72 n trust he is fit as fuck 60 is a number n for Michael that's the last thing on his mind any real fan will know that cheers its a number especially nowadays
ek1ePFp-nBI,ew
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I prefer Michael and Laurie being siblings, it makes more sense that way. Why is Michael still coming after her now?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's go Michael my favorite serial killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awsome I really want see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't care if him died like 18 times I was a kid when the movie first came out Jaime Lee Curtis didn't look like my grandma she was actually hot...you can call it what you wanted they ran out ideas so why not copy out gen of scarey movie....at least Jigsaw was a good movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't care if him died like 18 times I was a kid when the movie first came out Jaime Lee Curtis didn't look like my grandma she was actually hot...you can call it what you wanted they ran out ideas so why not copy out gen of scarey movie....at least Jigsaw was a good movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,if the name of the movie was going to be babysitter killer. Michael Myers will not be a thing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thats like the 8th time it's been remade he doesnt scared me
ek1ePFp-nBI,love how you can‚Äôt see his eyes this time and it‚Äôs just true black... real Halloween time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait until it comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael  thanks
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait to see this!!!¬† Michael Myers rules!!¬† The music is classic, I need that ring tone on my phone"
ek1ePFp-nBI,lol He Kills Teens But Not Tweens. üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't finish generators thanks to this guy ffs
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 Scene where he is bashing he's head against the toilet door is actually the British guy and at 2:06 there are two kids with the Silver Shamrock witch and skull mask from Halloween III season of the witch nice reference
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When he killed people as a kid it gave me the creeps, when he killed them as a grown up I thought it was cool"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If the doctor is in this can't he just make him disappear? I mean come on he's bloody doctor Monty after all a god of his own world?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Your Saying October 19 let's wait year later wait the movie is out... Oh
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hated it when Michael took off his mask in the original Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is the best
ek1ePFp-nBI,i cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What the shit is this? It looks so generic in a bad way. Rob Zombie did an amazing job at a reboot, just let it die. However. It IS refreshing to see a good old fashioned Slasher film back in theaters."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny mcbride is directing this movie he said he's going to make Michael more human like so it will seem more scarier to the audience that's weird because Michael Myers isn't human! John Carpenter is the creator of Michael Myers and he said Michael is not supposed to die
ek1ePFp-nBI,Waiting for trailer #2
ek1ePFp-nBI,Very hyped for this.  Kinda hope they come out with they come out with a better Freddy movie too!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let it go
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by mayers))
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie‚Äôs versions are better in my opinion this doesn‚Äôt look scary like his. Plus Zombie‚Äôs gave Michael an actual backstory creating a uniqueness and not just some crazed serial killer like we seen multiple times
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Movie looks awesome! By the way who's with me .That when this movie does great, which I know it will. Hollywood is going to get on the bandwagon to do parodies of this kinda movie, like a old school creepy slasher film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh man, i can't wait"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why does the hose in the background at 1:41 move?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It looks like the mask from the original Halloween, this should be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pleassss noooo Halloween micheol mayers
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't get why she's trying to kill him if she knows he can't die
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it just me or do I always say scary movies arient scary but end up shitting my pants in the end üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg it looks great!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot wait for this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see the kills
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't waitüòçüò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this movie stays with the same base but changes little thing to keep it from being the same movie it was 25 years agi
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pleaaasee don't suck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,They killed and ruined it. This movie is trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is so friken scary but it looks so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she died in halloween 2002?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,That damn song sends chills down my spine
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 sounds like pingu
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watch when Halloween does amazing. Then that means Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street production are going to have to step their game up!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone remember when Jamie Lee Curtis thought that her other film H2O would be the end of it since she killed her brother? but after she finished the film she later found out that there was a contract that she wasn‚Äôt aware  of and that nobody brought to her attention stating that Michael Myers will never die, so she only agreed to come back for the other movie Resurrection for a small appearance so that her character can be killed. 
But anyway I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs coming back for the new film but since there is this contract stating that Michael will never die, I think Laurie will either be killed in the movie or escape death with her family.. either way Michael will always be alive since they already talked about making another movie after this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for this movie to come out
ek1ePFp-nBI,just drop the fucking pallet Dwight god dammit
ek1ePFp-nBI,We've seen all of this before.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like a parody.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait so he is chained to dogs or to an anvil
ek1ePFp-nBI,My friend's nephew is the one who screamed 'Dad look out!' At 1:23. So honored ‚ô°
ek1ePFp-nBI,Theme song is lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Tell This Movie Is Gonna Be Great
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie still looks just like she did in 1978
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of greatest soundtracks!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe Micheal just needs some activia.
Constipation makes everybody grumpy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,o my gosh I CAN NOT WAIT WHEN Michael myers back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My only problem with them retconning all the other films, is that at this point, Michael killed ""only"" 4 people in his whole serial killer career. So all the other inmates and the dog going crazy when they see the mask feels like a bit of an overkill. Without the events of the other films, he shouldn't be that big of a ""legend"" among the other nutjobs. Looks sick though!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this does look like a good movie, but i hoping is that Jason Voorhees will return one day"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,bitch I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve watched this trailer! I really want to see this movie right now‚Äô
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I mean, the trailer looks good but that doesn't mean much."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should have picked it up after Resurrection.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can‚Äôt wait for this. It‚Äôll be cool to see where they go with this


But Laurie and Michael will always be siblings to me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's like H20 all over again. I would have been so much more into this if they had brought Danielle Harris back. I'd rather them have acted like 6,7,8 never happened and let Jamie and Laurie have the much needed mother/daughter reunion they should have gotten instead of constantly giving her a new kid every movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait! Jamie Lee Curtis is back! :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fun Fact:¬†In the¬†original 1978 movie it was never provided that they were siblings and was only surmised by fans - Watch the original¬†film; It never comes up.¬†Laurie being Michael's sister¬†was only introduced as a plot point in the 2nd film. THIS film is a direct sequel to the original timeline of the 1978 movie and does not take Halloween 2 or any of the¬†other sequels into account. So the comment about them not being siblings is actually a nod to the original timeline. Well done.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do You Believe In The Boogeyman?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't supposed Laurie's been killed in Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,BADASS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok  üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"At least they match ""almost the same mask shape and look"", but without Donald Pleasence as dr Loomis...hm, well, who knows?...As we can see they copy few scenes from first and second part and even the sound fx are identical, so, I'll give it a chance...maybe!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait...Halloween 2 he was burned to death inside the hospital. Does this just completely disregard that part of the story?
ek1ePFp-nBI,LEGENDARYYYY
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hype 10000000000000000
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why the actual hell would you give him the damn mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yep... For now
ek1ePFp-nBI,so she's John wick..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit is this real please don‚Äôt be a joke tell me this shi for real tough
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so fucking hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,The 1978 classic is always the standard but this looks solid

ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant Wait!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The thing its a remake of john carpenter and the timeline is the second movie of halloween. I was hoping for the the series could continue on the halloween the last one but sadly its a remake for the second one and the same person that first made the whole series so yeah should i really watch this movie or should I act like a freaking idiot and act like the series continued
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I can not wait üôä
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched this trailer when I was waiting for the First Purge to start in the theater. I've never watched any of the previous movies. Will I have to watch them to understand this? It looks really interesting
ek1ePFp-nBI,He was shot multiple times and put him back in hostpital. People ask if he is imortal dahh shows it right there.
ek1ePFp-nBI,After that god awful Purge movie I‚Äôm a little worried...
ek1ePFp-nBI,not what i expected.this looks legit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"40 years for a sequel?????
I will love it when they come up with a Halloween movie that explains why he keeps chasing Lori Strode? why he can‚Äôt die? Why end the new movie with a fire when we have seen so many burning Michaels and the cra cra still keeps coming back? Why?

At least the black couple didn‚Äôt get killed first hahahahaha üëç"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Me voy a cagar el d√≠a que la vea.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so dame Hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It would be cool when they make a special night when the played first the original one than this.

ek1ePFp-nBI,EVERY HALLOWEEN I GRABE A REAL KIFE AND PRANK MU BROTHER WITH A MICHEAL MAYERS SUIT. AND I PUT FAKE BODYS ALL AROUND MY HOUSE
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Jamie Lee is the new Loomis. It's gonna suck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want a scene in this film where Laurie sets off a bunch of traps and Michael actually runs away from her. She becomes the hunter and Michael the prey for one scene.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's already been redone amazingly by Rob Zombie, these fools are just trying to make a quick buck of course it's going to suck, can't stand the way the movie business nowadays all about money no pride just shoot and edit it and get it to theatres"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"There is exactly one frame at 1:49 of Michael's face, and he looks just as he did during the climax of the original. That's the kind of attention to detail I like to see."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I want this to be good. The trailer is way too good, just hope the movie doesn't get overhyped. But that music still has that same awesome feel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't understand the premise of the movie.. Why is he still alive and what's the Plot ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG I love it this
ek1ePFp-nBI,„Éû„Ç§„Ç≥„ÉºÔºÅÔºÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Decisive Strike .
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween comes 12 days early this year.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please don‚Äôt have a female leading role, please follow the roots of the original story, please don‚Äôt be cringy, please BE GOOD! PLEASE"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I realized this movie is coming out on his birthday.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That little knife twirl. He must be thinking ""back in the game, baby."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Most anticipated film for the rest of this year
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's not a Halloween movie unless you see Laurie kicking ass like the queen she is!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks horrible.Same old shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this remake or the next ep?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bought instruction from Avasva and I build it very very cheap.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg how old is MM now?50
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cant wait for this moviee.
But, is this movie a sequel from original halloween movie? I only watched the rob zombie's halloween 1 and 2 and i love the halloween 1"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That asylum scene looks the dogs b*llocks.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im even playing him in dead by daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,It was 9:00 PM when I started watching it now it's 2:04
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finnally üôå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love you, Michael Myers......"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she die ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,it looks pretty good just hoping it won't disappoint anyone
ek1ePFp-nBI,GOD DAMN I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
ek1ePFp-nBI,The theme song always gives me chills... I LOVE IT X3
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm pretty skeptical that Michael is NOT her brother. I‚Äôm pretty sure that they are siblings. Laurie knows they are. And all the older people know they are. But I feel like Laurie‚Äôs granddaughter was always told it wasn‚Äôt her grandmas brother. I mean I‚Äôm sure she heard the story when she was younger so it would make sense for them to hide it from a young child that they had such an evil person in the family. Because it was revealed they were siblings in part 2. But in this timeline part 2 never happened. But even then them being siblings would have to be a constant because it was something even before the first movie, whether it was said or not. My real question is why would they ask if Laurie‚Äôs brother was Michael Myers if supposedly part 2 happened. Where did that kid get that idea from? I really feel like they‚Äôre doing to her what they did to Laurie. Hide Michael from her. Hide the fact that he‚Äôs family."
ek1ePFp-nBI,We will make Michael myers great again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait I,love Halloween üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Myers will have Evil Within 3 for the whole movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really just hope Michael wins. I don‚Äôt know why, but it is just really satisfying when the killer wins. Besides I feel like Michael should win. It‚Äôd be strange to see him die."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This one look lame asfü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why tf when he was in the closet did the cover her head like that not gonna help
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:12 ‚ÄúTitus!‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is my favorite horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, I thought no good horror movies would come out this year, slender man looks terrible, hopefully this will be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I‚Äôve been waiting!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope that it is good and that it sticks to its original roots I mean if this is really what they‚Äôre going to consider the second part from the first movie back in 1979
ek1ePFp-nBI,When u can't even beat an old man? This sounds interesting....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael you're back this is sick
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Universewindowtint.com
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I feel this is going to be similar to H20, if you get what I mean."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I honestly rolled my eyes at the idea of making another Halloween.  After seeing interviews with Green and McBride they seem very dedicated to making this the best they can and have totally changed my opinion of this new addition.  I can actually say I am excited to see what direction they take this film in.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for it Michael Myers has always been my second favorite horror movie killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Soon as he throws that mask On and the MUSIC DROPS THE TRAILER GETS FIREEEEEEEE üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They should have let this franchise die already.  We had a classic original and some great sequels including part 3 even though it did not have Myers.  Then all of a sudden they pulled that crap with H20 telling us fans to ignore all the other sequels which was insulting to us and to everyone in those films and frankly H20 was trying to copy the film  Scream so it was the first film to not even feel like a Halloween film plus it was just a horrible movie.  Then Rob Zombie did yet another reboot!!

Now they want to do a THIRD reboot and tell us YET again to ignore everything and all of the events from all the other films all of the originals and the two other reboots I mean wtf!!!  This is silly too this means Myers only killed 3 people which means he is not a big deal at all especially after 40 years so he would be nothing to nobody!  Killing 3 people is nothing these days and especially when it happened 40 years ago! My goodness it is so sad how a once great franchise has turned into such a bad insulting joke"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this isn't coming out on Halloween,how disappointing!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'M SOOOO READY BRO PLS DON'T SUCK OR I'LL BE SO PISSED  OFF
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes Michael is back yayayaya!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant  wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie lee Curtis,,aka Laura will end Michael,,, 2018,, forever,,,, yessss,, we are waiting,,,, come on Jamie bring it On,,"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I def want to see this but I know it won‚Äôt be as bloody as rob zombies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm sorry. But dude is like 80 yrs old. Just wait till he runs out of insulin
ek1ePFp-nBI,"how many times has this been rebooted? Still, I'd be interested in seeing it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Y'all must have forgotten that Laurie died in Halloween Resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,~I‚Äôve been waiting this for a longgg time~
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,16 million of views for a trailer of horror movie! Only Halloween!  Classic! Looking forward!
ek1ePFp-nBI,16 milh√µes de views pra um trailer de filme de terror. S√≥ sendo Halloween mesmo! Cl√°ssico! Looking forward !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,You don't know what death is.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am SOO excited!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wished they had a bigger Micheal myers like rob zombies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like it so far what about you
ek1ePFp-nBI,who else hopes Michael survives
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think this is my 100th time watching this trailer...oh what the hell let's make it 101.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god why doesn‚Äôt this look like shit? Please god no i want to sleep!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Tbh, the whole sibling narrative never really made much sense when you stop to think about it. Because wouldn't Dr. Loomis know Michael had another sister during the first movie? He was his doctor for 15 years. Wouldn't he just go find Laurie & get her into protective custody from Michael or something instead of roaming the streets of Haddonfield looking for him all day & night? But supposedly he only finds out about Laurie when Marion tells him in Halloween ll. You can tell it was sloppy storytelling. If you're keeping with the spirit of the original, then it makes a lot more sense that Michael Myers, who's been locked in an insane asylum staring a a wall for 15 years, sees this pretty girl on his front door step, becomes fixated on her & begins stalking her & her friends. Michael's actions was never meant to be fully understood or rationalized which is why the original Halloween purposely doesn't explore any motive for his killing & instead portrays him as this abstract evil. That being said, I am excited for this movie & look forward to seeing what kind of backstory the new filmmakers come up with to fill the 40 year gap in time."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My closet is so tiny my 10 year old little brother can‚Äôt even fit inside. But if someone shows up at my bedroom at night, you know we‚Äôre gonna have some fun üòâ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,FortNite!!! Tommy Gun & Gas Grenadesüî•üî• BustedBong Live Now!! Twitch.tv/BustedBong
ek1ePFp-nBI,So boring! Same old story!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music is scarier than the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG HE IS BACK FOR REVENGE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I feel like Laurie is the real hunter here,dayum Michael stay in prison or she'll get your head"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt she cut his head off in H20 üôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,HE'S. STILL. ALIVE.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 shit I'm screwed
ek1ePFp-nBI,i really hope Laurie doesnt die (again) due to JLC wrapping up her scenes so quickly into production
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:51 

i smell memes"
ek1ePFp-nBI,You would think a serial killer after being in prison for so long would big af. They made him look small in this one. I'm shocked.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so trite.  The Lori Strode  story is played out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This should do really well
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeaa
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Something about this one that it gives off that i think the newest Friday the 13th remake did well was it gives the killer a more real movement feel to it. He doesn't seem so static anymore, he feels faster or more fluid just in the way he turns or walk i nteh few scene, like the knife flipping. Also the mask looks wicked."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally back to the original rob zombies was trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol i killed michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Succc
ek1ePFp-nBI,tuck what grain photographer trading tree funny result assure intervention nonetheless.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HALLOWEEN MF
ek1ePFp-nBI,But why do they go crazy when they pull out the mask? IS CAPTAIN CURT BACK FROM THE DEAD?!?!?!?! LOL?!?!?!?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last scene was good. Great build-up. And the asylum scene with the mask is gonna be iconic for sure
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone who has seen Danny Mcbride talk about this movie knows that its gonna be awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Been a long time I been waiting for this one and my fam too
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she die in one of them
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jaimie Lee Curtis still fucking hot after all those years
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Poor Laurie.....Scared another one away!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Member? You member berries.
ek1ePFp-nBI,„É≠„Éº„É™„Éº„Å£„Å¶Áîü„Åç„Å¶„Åü„ÅÆÔºüÔºüÔºüÔºüÔºüÔºü
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,So hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,I only hope to God they don‚Äôt kill her off again. The first few mins of Resurrection pissed me off
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I know that blonde babysitter dies, but tell me the little boy gets away! Black lives matter!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,who else had dumb moment and questioned when thid was coming out for a secüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,*OMG*
ek1ePFp-nBI,hell yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't Laurie Strode died in Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie better be good because I want  a sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks like a very thought out script i like how they left original last scene halloween movie open for a sequel like this john carpenter work is just brilliant and how smart
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael uses male reporter's head to bash in the bathroom stall, then magically the male reporter's body completely disappears from the bathroom when MM reaches under the bathroom stall to grab the female reporter?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I Love Jamie In This Movie! She Is 1 Bad Smoking Gun Shooting Woman! Happy Halloween, JLC!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love this version of Michael and like in older Halloweens. I hate when they make Jason and Michael like 8 foot tall something about them being the size of a normal person but the strength of a super strong person.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Halloween!
ek1ePFp-nBI,MIKE IS THE GOAT OF HORROR MOVIES! üôåüèΩ
ek1ePFp-nBI,ummmmmmmmmm WHY IN THE FRESH HELL WOULD YOU GIVE MICHEAL FUCKING MEYERS HIS MASK BACK basically tell him 'Here go out and kill again'
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sick in a good way
ek1ePFp-nBI,That lady is  sicl
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nbs in my opinion hes the best killer ever.
ek1ePFp-nBI,when are they gonna *release the 2nd trailer* !?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yawn. Michael is so boring
ek1ePFp-nBI,"same woman ,this is gold"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I literally watched the entire movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this finna be good for halloween i watching this
ek1ePFp-nBI,So yet again we are told to forget the sequels. Well hell then that means he only killed 3 people which means Myers is not a big deal so why would anyone make a fuss about him ever let alone especially after 40 years!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dont know if carpenter can pull it off again. So many have tried and so many have failed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow!  This actually doesn't look horrible like the last two Rob Zombie made!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maybe my favorite trailer of all time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,at 2:05 you can see kids wearing the Silver Shamrock masks from Halloween III.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The king of slashers has returned
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandma gonna carry the game
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought his head got chopped off.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Come on, really? This movie will be stupid. With today's technology of monitoring and real time alerts, who would be running, screaming and stumbling from a 61 year old killer without a smart phone on hand? This kind of movie stalker horror and ignorant sense of fear does not work anymore in a technological society."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:52-2:02 is where it sold me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit hell yess!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Of course Blumhouse made it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think they should have gotten a bigger guy to play Michael Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael just camed  1:30
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm screaming!hail Michael myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Plsssss be good plsssd
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she died in another Halloween movie ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So fired up about this. Especially having Carpenter back who also does the unprecedented score. That made the 1978 Classic. The test screening reviews from th original were poor. There was no score for the movie. And carpenter went to work and the rest is history. 

So many parts of just the trailer paying homage to the original truly, I believe, with Curtis, Castle (the original shape though it‚Äôs actually a stunt actor who learned how to kill from a real life hit man who plays MNin most of the scenes),and the aforementioned could make this a genuine classic. 
The scene of Michael bumping into the boys. = Tommy running into him around the schoolyard 1978
The girl trapped in what looks like an outdoor laundry room - Annie 1978
Of course Michael dressed as a what looks like an attempt to appear as a prop ghost - Linda thinking it‚Äôs Bob 
The realistic sketches of Loomis - Donald Pleasance chilling and epic performance(s) in the original are timeless. 

Pumped up!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween H20 is a classic too.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie has officially lost her marbles. When will you learn, Michael? When will you learn thAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael myers,Jason voorheese and Freddy krueger...




LEGENDS WILL NEVER DIE"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michal is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What I wanna know is why doesn't Mikey Myers just get put down? I mean, he's past the point of no return in becoming a productive member in society. 

Just have a firing squad surround him in that court and unload 7 Assault Rifle-15's in his aaa."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait üéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"**Sees Jamie Lee Curtis...*

*""AUGHghghgh SHIT!!! Dis iz juss sum FEMINIST BULLSHIT!!!!! >:((((""*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This nigga goofy but I hope this movie don't suck like the rob zombie ones
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dont worry i will kill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, Universal bought their Halloween franchise back."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I actually had a very bad nightmare ...

ek1ePFp-nBI,YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN THE BOOGEYMAN!
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE SHAPE IS BACK!
ek1ePFp-nBI,WILL HE FINALLY WIN??? WELL SEE OCTOBER!!! LOOK FORWARD TOO MICHAEL ENDING THINGS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They should have just made this an anthology series after the first one. 
It would have made this movie more impactful, instead it's just ""Oh, look,  another Michael Myers movie..."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Bow down to the king,the greatest killer alive."
ek1ePFp-nBI,ITS COMING HOME
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No matter how fast you run, Michael Meyers always walks faster"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again? Maybe she can finally kill him with a brutal Activia fart.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great
ek1ePFp-nBI,When is this Coming to cinemas ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love this guy, can‚Äôt wait , its been too long! 40 yrs, c‚Äômom Michael! I‚Äôm waiting üëÄ"

ek1ePFp-nBI,How the hell is he alive ? He had is head taken clean off  he's not ducking worzel gummidge
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think it looks awesome. I mean just the return of Jamie Lee is so EPIC.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Laurie turns full hunting mode for Micheal
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should release in theaters the Producers cut version of part 6 and then do the sequel that was planned for that film which sounded so good and stop with this silly crap like h20 and robs films and now this!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do I have the feeling I just saw 90% of the movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,look at the left window 2:09 theres a 2nd stalker wtf üíÄüòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm trying to figure out why you'd fire a revolver at a window. I guess it harks back to Dr. Loomis, and the breaking glass at the showdown in the first film.
Hopefully with John Carpenter at the helm it will gel with true horror fans and make Michael Myers a force to be considered again."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome can't wait till the movie comes out on halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,they even cut out part 2 ?!    I figured they would at least have included that since it took place the exact same night.  Now they want to completely switch the story up.  Lol ok
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,Here comes Michael myers

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I saw this story on John Carpenter on CBS Sunday Morning last October. Good story. 

CBS Sunday Morning
Published on Oct 29, 2017
The filmmaker who is king of things that go bump in the night is a musical master of horror as well. Lee Cowan talks with director-composer John Carpenter, whose next film is a ""real"" sequel to his classic 1978 horror film ""Halloween,"" with returning star Jamie Lee Curtis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TY3-Ca1E-M"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I knew about this October... but I will post this now. Most Halloween diehards know about this already... but this is for all of you casual fans. For those who know this already, no need to reply. 

 If he spent 40 years in captivity since Halloween 1, that means every sequel since then are no longer canon. 

Halloween 3 had nothing to do with Michael Myers. It was a separate story.
Halloween 4, 5 and 1995's Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers were all connected with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) playing the lead role. These three films focused on the Jamie Lloyd character.

Halloween H20 in 1998 and Halloween: Resurrection in 2002 were connected with Jamie Lee Curtis reprising her role as Laurie Strode. Laurie Strode actually DIED in Halloween: Resurrection. Michael Myers killed her.

Rob Zombie's two films in 2007 and 2009 were reboots."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Girl in the bathroom stall is hot.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome I hope they explain a few things like how she survived the attack in 2002 (if that‚Äôs what happened) I like to think of this as a continuation we‚Äôll see
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dope trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"lol only the first 2 movies were good, the rest sucked"
ek1ePFp-nBI,_Oh no._
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:06 for some reason that scene is just like Predator
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Kinda already sucks having a ""badass old Laurie"" (no thanks, I want classic scared teens and nice archetypal killer Myers is) and, well, white families adopting black kids (oy vey)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why wait for Michael Myers every year when you could put him in a crate and send him to the bottom of the ocean
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""can you close the closet door"" *keeps trying to close it* *doesnt close* *opens door* *myers is right there with a knife* me:*jumps up* holy **** that scared me *heart is still racing five minutes later*üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,is it myers or vorhees that never dies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I WANT TO SEE THIS SO BAD!!! Reeeeeeeeeeeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope they FINALLY kill him off this time. Halloween 1978 is an absolute classic as well as one of my favorite horror films but I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fucking sick of the shitty sequels and remakes. Just let this franchise die with some fucking dignity PLEASE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I kinda think of the kings dead video in the beginning

ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck off hollywoo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I WANT SEE HALLOWEEN SOOOOO BAD
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like some great movies should be left alone
ek1ePFp-nBI,She cut his head off last time ....how?
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg seriously!!!!! aint no way this is going to top Rob Zombies remake of it from 2007
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't believe they are going to have Nick Castle play Michael. Yes yes I know he worked on the original but we need someone a little taller. We didn't need a skyscraper like Tyler Mane but Castle at 5'10 is just a little too short. Just my opinion.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man if Michael Myers is so evil in the new Halloween movie why doesn‚Äôt he kill the kids too in the trailer I swear movies need to start going all in I‚Äôm tired of this pussy shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know who everyone is dressing up as for HALLOWEEN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell Yeah Michael Myers is Back üòÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Has anyone realises that when Lori shot the window that Michael was standing at broke, then Michael‚Äôs head (where Lori shot around at) made it look like there is nothing inside Michael, all he looks like at that moment is a Shape, the vesicle of Evil, and I think the director of the film took the name of one of Michael‚Äôs names ‚Äúthe shape‚Äù so creepy, but its a nice touch"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo fuck why is this trailer everywhere
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So glad they're going back to the original series even if they are forgetting the sequels. The Rob Zombie remakes were absolutely dreadful! I like Rob, and I'm excited for the House of 1000 Corpses/Devil's Rejects sequel, but he fucked with Halloween too much."
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait! i hope they give him his own game he deserved one b4 jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish they had included the brother and sister thing 'cause it explained why he was so obsessed with Laurie. Also it would make more sense that they captured him after the second movie where it looked like he burned to death instead of the first one where he just disappeared. But I'm still so excited!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,When are they gonna show his faceeeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be the only trailer /  commercial I will see ......... That way I don't spoiler myself because movie marketing sucks now a days......

ek1ePFp-nBI,I personally don't want Michael to die. Don't really know why...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nearly 9,000 people who disliked obviously dont like horror films."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm not opposed to the sibling aspect being taken away as that storyline is definitely tired at this point. But I‚Äôm curious as to what they‚Äôre gonna replace it with. People saying cause ‚Äúlaurie‚Äôs the one that escaped‚Äù as a motive for Michael. but why would Laurie think that he‚Äôs specifically after him? Long story short, please don‚Äôt fuck this up danny McBride"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*god damnit Laurie*
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is literally the only reason why I want my summer break to end already

ek1ePFp-nBI,–ñ–¥—É
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think Laurie will die üò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They will probably kill that grandmother in the movie and let michael escape just in order to make like thousands more sequels and to turn the franchise into something like the alien, terminator  or friday the 13th into basically movies that have been milked to death by bad directors"
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck u mike
ek1ePFp-nBI,i already know this movie is bouta be a fucking banger ! i‚Äôve waited 16 years for another halloween movie to come out. god is good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like CryptTV thanks for making this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,yesss my favorite horror movie series
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He's been tryna kill his sister since the 70's, relentless as fuck"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks amazing. Hope its good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I think they are related. However as you can see Laurie didn‚Äôt tell her family everything until the last minute when she was informed that he had escaped, especially not her granddaughter, may I add who would be terrified if Laurie were to tell her something like that as a little girl let alone a pre-teen
 And whether and/or whether not Carpenter was intoxicated or not while writing this script it was well written. However I do like Zombies‚Äô version as well a lot. It gives you more of a organic side about Michael and how it all came about. I understood through the eyes of that Devil sorta for once what made the darkness in him shape and mold into a ruthless killer. I‚Äôm hoping that this will be well written."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is like 7ft tall
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another pos remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone realize that Michael is 61 now
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For all the people going on about Michael being old, I'll remind you that Michael is chronologically 61. Ted White, the man that played Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th IV, was approximately 58 years old during the time of filming. Jackie Chan is 64. If real life men can be doing crazy stunts and running around all over the place in their late 50s/early 60s, I think Michael can _walk_ in his early 60s, especially when there is something supernatural about the guy.

Edit: Just look at the original movie though. Michael did nothing for 15 years except sit around staring at things. Then one night he springs to action, smashing car windows, breaking wooden doors, strangling and lifting a grown man and then pinning him to a wall with a butcher knife, strong enough to carry a tombstone and prop it up in a bedroom, etc, etc. If I spent 15 years sitting on my ass doing the bare minimum of physical activity, I'd be weak as hell. There's _something_ about the guy that's supernatural, just not to the degree that he's crushing skulls and surviving 5000 bullets.

ek1ePFp-nBI,In every Halloween he just be bumping into kids while they trick or treating and it's as if he just like carry on kiddies lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When he is standing in the window and Laurie sees him it‚Äôs a reference to Halloween h20 because she always saw him in windows and mirrors and he wasn‚Äôt really there in h20, I predict he‚Äôs not really in that window when Laurie shoots at him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What the heck..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is it these days with movie trailers showing you pretty much every good scene of the movie? They spoil the element of suspense.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait until October 19th
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael's sister always got him out of the light by pretending to kill him off, EVERY TIME. :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Instructor custom seat gyepl sweet recognize oh

ek1ePFp-nBI,"*""You don't believe in the boogeyman?""*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol saw and jason can kiss mike's ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Idk I don‚Äôt really care for how they made his mask look old..it‚Äôs creepier to think of him as an entity of evil
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,This comes out on my birthday üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have always loved the theme music to Halloween xD
ek1ePFp-nBI,The legend has returned.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else is peeing their pants while hiding in the comments
ek1ePFp-nBI,It gets me every time he puts on the mask and then the music starts üò´
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse making Halloween and Five Nights at Freddy's. Coincidence?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait didn't Loren die
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this real
ek1ePFp-nBI,The blackest Eyes.......the devil‚Äôs eyes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it a remake or is it a sequel I'm just trying to figure it out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers deserves this folks. Let's give Halloween a box office smasher. The og John Carpenter is back to restore the franchise. Can't wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The iconic mask is backkkkk
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This nigga is what? 60 plus years old, Nigga just run away, kick him in the knee mother fuckers way to old to stop you."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Same actors love it but come on how did Michael survive 9 gun shots in last movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,It releases on my birthday yay
ek1ePFp-nBI,IDC what anyone says nothing compares to Rob Zombies versions.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,So how are they gonna address Loomis in this one besides Michael‚Äôs case files. They make him more important in the later sequels but he was still hellbent in stopping The Shape in the first film so them kinda ignoring him would be disservice.  Maybe Laurie remembers some things Loomis would teach her or tell her about Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally they made another Halloween movie my favorite person in the trailer is michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another hype up movie marketing off a classic name with the original characters then everybody goes see it and it SUCKSSSSSS not falling for it again lol ... yea I will
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal should eventually kill Laurie but a think she will give a good fight fair enuff but its Micheal myers ur fightn age dnt  matter to Micheal myers he's the boss the shape
ek1ePFp-nBI,More unnecessary cash-grab remakes...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Boogeyman <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this real?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""I waited for him"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seriously, how many times are they going to rewrite this storyline? Laurie dies and Michael stalks her daughter. Laurie lives and Michael stalks her son. Laurie decapitates Michael with an axe. Michael kills Laurie while she‚Äôs in an institution.
Laurie never dies and Michael‚Äôs in an institution.
Busta Rhymes does flying spin kicks! What‚Äôs next? Michael gets bitten by a radioactive spider, joins the resistance to bring down Skynet, and comes out as transgender? Now that I‚Äôd pay to see!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OK MICHAEL YOU GET A MOVIE I JUST DIED AND THEY GAVE UP ON ME
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween another 20 years later
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fam, that mask is spot on to part 2 1981"
ek1ePFp-nBI,how in the fuck is laurie still alive????
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If u pause it at 2:18, I‚Äôm pretty sure the person who says he doesn‚Äôt believe in the boogeyman is the kid from John Wick who said the same thing in that movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn I can‚Äôt wait for this to come out. Ive been waiting for 20 years since H20 for a real sequels to come out Resurrection wasn‚Äôt good at all
ek1ePFp-nBI,Going to see this opening night
ek1ePFp-nBI,"for fuck-sake, stop destroying this masterpiece already
The movie isn't even out-yet
And they still managed to show they had *NO UNDERSTANDING WHATSOEVER* of what made of Halloween one of the most celebrated horror-movie of all times
And no, putting ""Produced by John Carpenter"" and ""With Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode"" isn't enough to fool me

In this trailer, Michael just look like another retarded-slasher like Jason Voorhees
And don't get me wrong, i like Jason as much as the girl-next-door, but he's the exact opposite of Michael


What makes of Michael Myers one of the most Iconic horror-character ever
Is his cold, calculating, patient, creepy, and determined demeanor
He's a unstopable killing-machine, and you never know what goes into his head

He's scary not only because he dosn't show any form of emotions, reactions, or even hesitations in what he does
But because he's a methodic and smart killer
He go through great-lenght to find the best occasion to kill someone, and then does it without any form of hesitation and/or remorses
He'll spy on his victims without ever being seen, and then he'll get them as soon as they're isolated



He would never do something as stupid as killing someone in plain day while showing his murder-intents

The michael who try to scare a teenage-girl by banging on the toilet-door, and then throwing somes teeths at her
The michael who stab a dude in the back while looking straight at some girl in her car letting her plenty of time to press the honk 3 billions times to alert the whole fucking neighborhood
Isn't the Michael Myser who patiently waited for a girl to go to her car, slowly strangle her to death, and then move her body away because she pressed the klaxon

The mychael who goes around in the evening while wearing HIS FUCKING *MASK* EVEN THO' LAURIE FUCKING *KNOWS* HE'S OUT FOR HER
Isn't the same Michael who stayed in hidding, waiting for Halloween to come to use the occasion as a way to hide his identity with his terrifying mask


For fuck-sake, if you're gonna make another-remake/sequel again
At least try to understand the movie you're supposed to be working on...

If you're gonna go for the ""retarded killing-machine"" at least make a remake of Friday the 13th
Halloween suffered enough"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal Myers is the junk
ek1ePFp-nBI,I LOVE Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wasnt there a bathroom scene from the old movie similar to the one we see in the trailer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm so confused....  They should have continued from h20 so it can be a classic trilogy!  
Lol make have a old wicked man sew his head back together? Or his crazy self should have picked it up and put it on himself.  

Please don't suck.  I'll see 10/19/18"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is no longer a horror movie after I've watched Ochido...
ek1ePFp-nBI,The old women looks bad ass

ek1ePFp-nBI,She's back! He's back! H40

ek1ePFp-nBI,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQ4B0UI_8qm1dpnzvkS-Kg
ek1ePFp-nBI,There you go. The whole movie in just a trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Could 1:56 be the new theme song
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:12 - 1:18 - 0:48 - 1:25 - 1:55 - 2:22 - 1:51 - 2:18
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I. WATCH. THIS. TRAILER. EVERY. DAY. 

One of the best trailers ever made."
ek1ePFp-nBI,WET
ek1ePFp-nBI,Then you realize he is 60 and will probably collapse half way up a flight of stairs
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I still hate the fact that all the events happened on Halloween II and H:20 were deleted, now there's supposed that this movie is a direct sequel from Halloween: The Night He Came Home (1978), whatever, hope at least this will be a good one!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúCan you close the closet door‚Äù nah it‚Äôs your turn bitch.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Duck her shes a libtard
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Soooo when will we finally get a movie with all the infamous killers together? Shit id pay good money to see Michael, Freddy, Jason, Leatherface, Ghostface, and whoever else all in one movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"WHY, WHY did there have to be another timeline"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This and Creed 2 films to watch
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awsome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Jamie you still sexy as hell even though you like 104 years old now Boo ... I love you
ek1ePFp-nBI,im the return of halloween reboot 3 of 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:44 this is what the dentist looks like to me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael escaped... again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can‚Äôt they just release all the old decent horrors at the cinema, don‚Äôt see the point in all of these revisits/rereleases."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like how they are handling Laurie, two cold blooded forces converging on each other. Who will triumph?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really want this to tie end to the original Halloween screw the other movies if not I'm done
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like they were going for a reboot, threw in some H2 shots... took notice of how effective H1 was.... Threw out the shit sequels.... and possibly made a good movie this time around and John finally decided to have some actual input.
Going by Jason Blumhouse's statement long before this trailer came out he originally wrote this was a reboot with JLC and made it sound like this was simply a new movie... sort of like hey... H1 wasn't even going to be connected and that's why alot of the scenes look straight out of H1... like the gas station scene. They take parts of H1 and kick it up a huge notch.... maybe simply because... why not?   But it certainly is heavy on retro/reboot than a fresh out of the box sequel from H1. At times it almost mimics a H1 reshoot.... as well. Except... JLC is old as is The Shape. He escapes the asylum.... again.... ok... makes his way back but She's actually waiting for him... that's a hell of a wait. :D  Still .... looking forward to it.... just hoping it doesn't suck. If it can hang with even Halloween 2 I'd be happy enough. Now where o where is Ben Tramer in all of this?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,For the people wondering.. should I watch all the Halloween movies so I can catch up on whats happened. Just watch the first one from 1978.. this movie has nothing to do with the rest of them.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope it's good. Blum is always good to us üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes it's coming out on my birthday üéÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now that's exciting
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes give him back his mask that‚Äôll help....that‚Äôs like giving Jason his machete back ,dumbass"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now this trailer looks actually good than ‚ÄúThe Predator‚Äù üòó
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal ain't got time fo yo dookie games.
ek1ePFp-nBI,john carpenter and jamie lee curtis needed money....only reason this exists.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just a Handful of teeth ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,If y'all didn't know this is gonna be john carpenter's last one!!.. and if u all didn't know he didn't want to do another one he left it go but he is back for one more let's hope this is a success.and this is kinda gonna be a remake of the 1st on ever it's gonna be based on the first one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Soooooo.....how did Laurie and Michael escape the entity's world?
ek1ePFp-nBI,#justicefortramer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pause at 2:09 look at the left window I think that‚Äôs Michael and the right is a mirror so she shoots the mirror.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's back.. üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,The grey hair is from Jamie trying to kill Micheal
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Too bad Donald Pleasence is dead. 

Dr. Loomis in this pic would have been awesome! Of course, he would have been 99 years old if he was still living. So, he probably would not have moved around too much. LOL!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am the only one who hopes they don't go on the predictable path and actually let Michael win? I think he should finish the job he set out to do.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cooool
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm going see that Halloween best scary movie every
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween mask give away guys from us over at CSR! https://vy.tc/fWpNh16
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good. Glad they‚Äôre bringing Michael back as the shape like in the original. The original was so good because there was no rhyme or reason to Michael‚Äôs killing. There was just the right mystique around him and no cliches. Also glad they are not having him related to Laurie. That idea was dumb because it gave him some motivation for killing which took away some of the mystique. Love the original soundtrack back too. Can‚Äôt wait to see his one. Hope it‚Äôs good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason U have been replaced
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I will always love ""Halloween"" movies. You can bring Michael back any type of way and I will STILL watch it lml Cheers to keeping Jamie Lee Curtis involved!!! WOO!!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie go be sooooo good.

ek1ePFp-nBI,It clearly shows Jamie dies from killing herself in Halloween Resurrection...Now she is back???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im a huge michael myers fan but Rob Zombie shitted on all the Halloweens! Rob Zombie gives you reality of Michael Myersüòéüòéüòé This new Halloween coming out will be on Netflix within a week  after its release
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Felt like Taissa Farmiga would have been a good pick to play some role but I also think that it would have been better to have Michael sporting a ball and gag or a Yoda mask so what do I know. (Sigh) A boy can dream
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait to see this.¬† Who plays Michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm confused Laurie died at the hospital when they was both hanging off the building ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è someone help me understand
ek1ePFp-nBI,Weird halloween around june? Legit!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I did kinda like the brother sister vibe of the older movies but this still looks incredible
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope the skull trooper comes back this Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The 1st one was a classic in its time. It wasn‚Äôt really done before and opened the door to a genre. 

I think this will feel like (although it‚Äôs a sequel) a remake of the original but brought forward to appeal to 2018 audiences. 

It will never have the impact of the original because that can‚Äôt be replicated, but my god I think it will go toe to toe in every other department. And it has the added element of nostalgia. You can‚Äôt ask for any more than that. I just watched a trailer for Halloween H20 and although I enjoyed it at the time it looks like a made for TV movie by today‚Äôs standards. This trailer looks like it‚Äôs going back to some of the elements that made the original so compelling. Seeing Michael from afar like the scene at the window instead of in your face right away, leaving your imagination to scare you before slowly being relieved really has me excited for this movie.

 With original cast members and the best music I‚Äôve ever heard in a horror film, this has the makings of an absolute classic. 

And if you didn‚Äôt shit yourself when he appeared in the wardrobe you‚Äôre a liar."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell  yah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg fan orgasm üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,When does it hit theaters??? I wanna see it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they do another  Friday the 13th
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CAN'T WAIT HOPE THIS GOOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLLYWOOD IS FRESH OUT OF IDEAS!! Another unnecessary reboot to cash in on people‚Äôs nostalgia üôÑ. Rob Zombie‚Äôs version were enough.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahhhhhh.  Im sooo ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh crap 0:41
ek1ePFp-nBI,üò±üò±üëèüèΩüëèüèΩI‚Äôve been waiting for this Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt suck

ek1ePFp-nBI,holy FUCK
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks good, but I'm personally a little concerned about Michael and Laurie no longer being siblings. Despite the other problems with the Rob Zombie remakes, I enjoyed the sibling part, because it made sense that Michael had a reason for targeting her, and there was a deep emotional connection there. Why, if Michael isn't related to her, is Laurie so determined to and focused on finding him and killing him now, after 40 years?? I hope the movie explains a reason."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The thing about closing doors is that if it doesn't work on the first try you usually check to see what the problem is before attempting to close it again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I missed these movies. The Most of them aren't strange dir meine but I Love Halloween before Rob Zombie tried to make a remake. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer looks really great. But BlumHouse being involved has me worried. Everything i seen from them  was complete garbage except maybe Get Out. They make  horror films for teens. I hope they turn Halloween into a PG 13 rated slaher for kids . Just look at Truth or Dare lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant kill micheal myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now I'm afraid to go in my closet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks fantastic imo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Backk !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,"First we have to ignore parts 3,4,5,6, in H20, then after she ""kills"" Myers and ends the series we learn he's still alive and kills her in part 8, now we have to ignore ALL the sequels and watch this garbage?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That damn mask!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where is JIMMY? Jimmy
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUDGE YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The question is, is Laurie's husband Ben Tramer?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This Gonne be Amazing 

Halloween !!!üòÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhh yeaaaa Mike Is back hahahahaaa
ek1ePFp-nBI,Show responsible laboratory invest normally veteran literature link campaign emerge human classroom sign.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who's hyped for this? A shame about Halloween 2 being retconned, though."
ek1ePFp-nBI,damn bro Michael must be so fucking old.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That can happen sometimes yes but not always, there are songs, movies, books etc I loved as a kid that I have went back to and thought what the he'll was I thinking? I dunno how many times I've seen Halloween 3 and its really never been a favorite film of mine but I do enjoy it. I think that film gave me more nightmares than any other Halloween film did because Michael is a hard motherfucker to kill but we as kids put masks on for trick or treating. We all loved it and what is scarier than masks that kill ? Another film that I really love that gets overlooked  is 1988s remote control. Its also shot a bit like a 1950s film mixed in with a 1980s. If you've seen it you will know what I mean. I dunno how old you are but check it out it may even be on you tube"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Personally i think this is going to be one of the most intense and Suspenseful Movie in The Halloween franchise I'm hoping this Goes beyond The Original (like those better then the original films)
ek1ePFp-nBI,finally a halloween movie released in October
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know michaels dentist office has some serious lawsuits.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Only if your a true Halloween fan you would know that at 0:34 that‚Äôs a bell that plays throughout the very first Halloween movie from 1978 and only that one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope they feature the original theme song in the new movie.  The subsequent Halloween movies had variations of the theme song, and while they are similar to the original, they don't measure up.  The original is the best!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like this trailer gets better and better each time I watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee is back baby!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*Sigh* If only Randy from Scream were alive, he'd have loved to have seen this... ;-)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If there's one place I don't want to die in it's in a bathroom stall tryin to do my business.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how Michael's middle name is Audrey.  So bizarre and out of place it fits with his otherwordly aura.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This one shud be called Halloween resurrection cuz Jamie came back from the dead üòÇüòÇ must run in the fam #GangGang
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man the horror genre is always a fucking let down... You get a decent horror once every 20 years or something...
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is no match for me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should they make a michael v jason movie if so my oponion michael wins!!hands down
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet he still not finna die ... indestructible ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the Michael Myers theme song.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I was drinking a Coke then the closet part in the trailer made soda overflow my lip making it spill on my shirt




Plz No normie comments..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Little Mikey Myers that lived across the street.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok I feel stupid and srry for ur loss of brain cells but who is Jamie lee Curtis? Was she the og escapist from the first movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Paramount own the rights of FT13th up part 8.. they sold it to  New Line parts 9 and on....paramount always hated and was embarrassed ny FTa13th movies now paramount wants ownership back since they are making money
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How is he still killing people?!? He should be old as fuck where any normal healthy abled bodied 20-something should be able to fuck his old ass up! His super human reflexes should be gone by now, not to mention his body should be with some serious problems or impediments due to all of the damage and trauma it sustained over the years. Plus he looks short as fuck and skinny which supports him being old and supports him likely being able to get fucked up by an abled bodied athlete. This shit is not gonna suck but it will be lackluster/just ok if not disappointing because it‚Äôs tamed by today‚Äôs standards."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original virginal good girl next door scream queen.....wow...a horror movie that got 15 million views as of 6/2018???... This movie will be a huge hit and hopefully will be the last
ek1ePFp-nBI,Tbh I wasn‚Äôt born when the old movies came out but my dad showed them to me cuz he grew up knowing the Halloween movies and I‚Äôve seen em all now and I‚Äôm so glad there‚Äôs another one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this is something I would go to the movies to see







I would go to korea
I'm a korea boo"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wish it was Carpenter directing it. It's already looking like it doesn't have that 70's and 80's slasher feel. And all those fucking thuds, there's a good reason the original Halloween had no jumpscare noises. It didn't need them."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombies version was the best.  Michael was gigantic made him look terrifying
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINNALY thank god. I have been waiting this for years and some many youtubers keep clickbaitimg but I knew this is the right one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this can somehow match the original's tone and atmosphere... man we could be in for something special.  Unlike the exaggerated remakes and sequels, which were like a slap in the face to the legacy of John Carpenter's masterpiece.  I can't wait to review it, hopefully I won't be disappointed.  If it's anything like Rob Zombie's version it will just feel like a goddamn parody at this point."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Somebody please leak it already
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the best trailers ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,"my only complaint is that they could've called it something else instead of just 'Halloween', just to make it stand out from the original. Like Halloween Reborn, or Halloween Vengeance."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was looking forward to it...But it's a drag because imo this new mask totally sucks....And the whole Jamie Lee Curtis vigilante thing is completely cheesy........Hope it will at least be good for a Halloween sequel though......
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tapKFTg86Lg
ek1ePFp-nBI,I HOPE THIS GOOD AS IT SEEMS.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hate horror movies like Freddy and Jason. But Michael had great dark eyes of pain. I usually just watch true horror shows like Exorcism, Texas chainsaw and the haunting, etc. Those poor people. I know they were scared."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is back not that rob zombie shit finally an John Carpenter an the original Michael Myers are returning cannot wait an its 9 days after my bday will be seeing this more then once
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now i dont feel sorry no more for Michael. He had hate in his heart. I grew up feeling pain for him. I never wanted Michael to die. But now Michael has to finally die, Jamie. Enough is enough. He wont stop."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG BEST HORROR MOVIE IS BACK!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm hyped for this movie but just imagine Halloween 10 years from now... Halloween 5 50 years later. Michael is back for revenge üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a horror movie or an action horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOL Michael is played by some small weak ass guy who is like 5ft tall which everyone would beat up. Real Michael was 210cm tall and huge. This is gonna be bad
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cannnnt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Rob zombie did an excellent job on H1, but H2 sucked.  Especially when he killed off JLC character.  Hopefully this one is good.  Love this horror franchise."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 hiya Vicky aren't ya gonna say hello ?

ek1ePFp-nBI,omg I'm late...I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wanna see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael will never die lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic. Even if it ends up being nothing special, I‚Äôll take just fun and nostalgic. They know how to make a hell of a trailer. Even if his mask looks exactly like it did in Zombie‚Äôs."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please be good : c
ek1ePFp-nBI,what..is this is in a alternate world? i dont understand
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Freddy is fun to me, Jason is soft.. I will throw a bowl of water in his face and he will turn into a girl, but Micheal..smh.. this guy bothers me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why would they show him the mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It takes place after the original, maybe the second one if you listen."
ek1ePFp-nBI,PLEASE!!! DONT KILL JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN THIS MOVIE
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this a sequel to the first film that ignores all the other sequels. This means the sequel to Halloween is Halloween. This also means this is the 3rd Halloween 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Candy üç¨
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the reason why i put clear curtons on my shower lol

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, fine I'll go. But this better not suck."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael back at it again with a bigger knife
ek1ePFp-nBI,"MAN!! Every time i here the theme at 1:56 it gets me hyped af for this movie halloween has always been my favorite horror franchise, im hella juiced that  John carpenter hopped back on for this one"

ek1ePFp-nBI,2066 Anyone?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks boring
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael wont stop trying to kill his little sister. I though he died in H2O. Well maybe Jamie will stop him for good this time. You can see great pain in Michael's eyes. Jake Gyllenhaal told Jamie Lee Curtis, his God mother to make this film. üé• I ‚ù§ Jake."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus üíò loves u. He is your Lord and Savior. Follow him.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shouldn't Michael be like 60+ if Laura's a grandmother?

ek1ePFp-nBI,0:37 Old IDUBBBZ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ofn
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS. IS. AWESOME.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really don't care who they get to play Michael Myers I doesn't matter
Halloween H2O basically very similar type store in line and she actually had said and they had actually said this is the definitive last one you kill him it's over
Clearly because of course they want to make money on it that's not what happened and she was supposed to have been killed in the sequel to that movie so there's no consistency in the sequels to any of these for any things that it's just let's just make a horror film because we can type something
Especially when she was on NCIS that she said didn't want to do another Halloween film she just was kind of that's over  with I'm doing other stuff now and I think she must be desperate for cash
The TV series she was on it was supposed to be I really don't know how to describe that
Was not very good it was not on the air that long and that was the last gig that she had so for her to come back and try and Rehab something that's 30 plus years old it's got to be cuz she needs income"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this is a good movie me and my grandpa watched all of them when I was little now that he‚Äôs passed away any Halloween movie that comes out I hope is good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Killer üò®üò®
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm praying this movie is great....damn Jamie don't give a shit if she's typed cast as Laurie till the day she dies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks decent and Halloween is one of my movies of all times but I hope this is the last Halloween movie we see. Getting tired of Hollywood going back and picking apart these franchises.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey, as long as Michael Bay and all his talentless cronies (Nightmare remake, Friday the 13th remake) aren't doing, and ruining, this Franchise....I'm a happy 'Halloween' fan :-D

Man...thank GOD that they're not making this...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did the old bitch knew Michael was bulletproof?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gay
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you pay attention you can see he is pounding the face of the male doctor off of the bathroom stall door. Also, during the trailer when Jamie Lee Curtis shoots up into the window t Michael, there is another figure on the opposite side of the house in left window on the second floor."

ek1ePFp-nBI,The best horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis tryna get a victory royale with no scope bruh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nope Jesus really will, trusting in people is not good but trusting in the True King who will reign later is the one I trust. Trusting the one who created us all and died for us all is the one I would trust. John did not create you Jesus Christ did. Also he will off the real devil that is being promoted out there. Amen"
ek1ePFp-nBI,When is this getting released.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Last time I remember she was Josh Hartnett mum and it was 2001 I believe...

Shit he‚Äôs been shot & shot & still he escapes and gets shot some more but he‚Äôs in perfect health after all these years. Fuck just stick a knife in this storyline and let it be in peace"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this a reboot a sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can't wait for Michael Myers. He waits for you.
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/i-Q2LtZ8D0o official movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,At least it's not a remake/reboot. Hope it does well.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The last shot of Michael is weird.
The actress of Vicky (blond girl) is 1,73m, James Jude Courtney who plays Myers is 1,90m.
But he looks like 1,78m (like Castle in the original).
Did they add a lower floor for J.J. Courtney for this scene?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Actually looks good as shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 classic and can't wait to see this.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's just not scary anymore. In the late 70s and early 80s, perhaps the Halloween movies were far more intense & creepy but in 2018, we've seen so many great slashers & horror over the years. I'd like to see a sequel to The Strangers or Suicide Circle instead."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did he not get his head chopped off in H20???
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie Lee was so young & nubile in the original Halloween, but she looks mega old ancient in this one. It just ain't the same no more."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im only 13 but my parents let me watch 15's with them so really hoping this is rated a 15. Fingers crossed
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is my fav scary movies. I was micheal myers like 4 years ina row for halloween üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,This nigga Michael never diesüòÇüò≠ fuck!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please Lord.. Don't suck. Every remake of classical movies are sucky *BESIDES INCREDIBlE  2*
ek1ePFp-nBI,On the fence with this one. Plus I'm not sure exactly where on the Halloween timeline this film fits in.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg i hav to watch on a big screen its 1 of my fave boogeyman wen i was a litel kid back in 90's! Now hes mother only can kill him!
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is going to be slayed by Jesus Christ. Amen
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how there's a trailer for the trailer at the beginning
ek1ePFp-nBI,"John Carpenter is a legend. The world wasn't ready for Halloween in 1978, it freaked people out , and made Black Christmas and Psycho look like Sunday school picnics. And all that with virtually no gore, sex or extreme bad language. Truly a mastermind. Rob Zombie had to use all of the above , and in the end it was just another slasher movie. To this day I know people who can't even listen to the music."

ek1ePFp-nBI,I have watched this on a loop since it was released sitting here drinking coffee from my Michael Myers coffee mug in my Smith's Grove sanatarium t-shirt I cry every time I watch this trailer. Love how they pay homage to all the past movies . Halloween isn't a movie to me and my daughter it's a religion üòÅ beyond excited to to see this on October 19th Michael Audrey Myers birthday. üòçüòçüòç

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I bet Michael at 2:36 was like, ""I can't wait to kill this person.. They hurt my foot."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,it seems like this treats the sequals as both canon and non canon
ek1ePFp-nBI,In my opinion this new Halloween movie will be great.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh, and of course I will miss Nick Castle if this will his last role as Michael Myers. But I am glad that our real Michael Myers is back for one last time.üò¢üò¢. Nick is already 70 and I don't think he is going to act as Michael Myers anymore. This could probably be his last role as Michael Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only sad news is that this could probably be the last Halloween movie of Jamie Lee Curtis to star as Laurie. Oh I would really miss her if  this turns out to be true.üò≠üò≠üò¢
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus Universal. Your (actual) trailer starts out quiet, so why do you put a loud ass bumper right before it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers, my all-time frenemy is backkkkkkkk!! ^^ 
Go, get him, Laurie!!!! :)"

ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!!!!!!!!!  lol I was in high school when the first one came out. I am glad Jamie Lee Curtis is in it. I beg of you that made /or are making this film.....DO NOT SCREW UP A GOOD THING lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really a 70 year old woman against Michael Myers.   Wow great idea.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've never watched a horror trailer so much..but this one..I want to see and will be opening night.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Has anyone stopped to consider that in this film Michael Myers should be 61 years old?
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many michel myers there are
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Classics, cant beat them!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,ÈÖ∑
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:31 I hope that little boy gets away. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Michael has never killed a kid tho? It's been a while since I've seen any of the movies, but I don't think he has. Either cause they're not worth his time or they're fast little buggers. Then again, I don't think the series has put any kids near him when he had a chance to kill them."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"halloween 3 was a crapfest,should of made halloween a trilogy and be done with it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,How is Jamie Lee In this movie when Michael killed her in Halloween Resolution ü§îü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes please
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welcome back Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope it not like the last one, it was garbage"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"October is gonna be LIT AF 
With RDR2 and this oh hell yeah."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like how people have no hope in this movie by praying on there knees to hold it's not being hot garbage. More than half of the comments are people hoping it's not a bad movie. Clearly they think sequel equals evil.(bad) The trailer is really good, so you should expect it to be the Halloween 2 movie we didn't get."
ek1ePFp-nBI,If she‚Äôs not his sister then why the hell would he fixate on her??? They better have a great explanation for that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I kinda like that Laurie and Michael aren‚Äôt siblings in this version. If they WERE siblings, I think he would‚Äôve been focused on her alone in the first movie. And I think their sibling relationship would‚Äôve been revealed as the twist ending for the first movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,"they fucked up jeepers creepers 3.
this better be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The shape is back!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yea he's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"these evil movies are worthless and not worth watching. there is no boogie man that cant be killed.
if you want to think of something that is far far more terrifying than some actor wearing a mask and stalking people.
think of what the bible calls the lake of fire!!! where the wicked who die without Jesus go...forever!! to die forever and never come out ever!!!
repent and turn to The Lord Jesus right now!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank God Rob zombie isn't gonna direct and ruin this one!  His versions were trash! Return of the badass!
ek1ePFp-nBI,White people am I right. Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like they are foregoing all the Halloween disasters that came after the original and are making a true sequel to the original classic.
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAS JAMIE LEE CURTIS!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Stop. Remaking. This. Series. Please.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, I have many questions, but the two I will ask here are as follows: 

Is this a continuation of the Rob Zombie continuity? 

If it is a continuation of Rob Zombie's universe, did they ever establish why Michael is an ageless, invincible monster in the vein of Jason Voorhees?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Your right on why that movie wasn't a hit but ya gotta admit how nice it would have been had he not been in parts 4-8 I may have liked h20 but it is nowhere near as good as the 1st one. 4 to 6 and 8 range from mediocre to fucking awful.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequel or remake?
ek1ePFp-nBI,PLEASE let her kill him this time. It's overdue.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael is now over 60..., hope he doesn't need help stabbing people..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,I think I listened this before...
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks stupid....rob zombies version was the best one...and didnt jamie lee already cut michaels head off in h20...this remake was unnecessary.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequel to the 2007 halloween or is this a different one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if William Shatner still gets royalties from the face mask ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,what is the age limit for watching the movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was waiting for this! Finally! ‚ô°

ek1ePFp-nBI,The women's retarded by dillibratly letting the thing out. She already knows it can't be killed by any kind of normal weapon. How many times has it been stabbed shot and run over? Why keep it at a mental hostpital when it would realistically be kept at some underground government research lab. This hole story would make more sence if the thing was actually some sort of escaped goverment experimental super soldier instead of evil.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Having Michael locked up negates the point of the ending of the first film where Michael goes missing.  Also, having Laurie be ""ready"" for Michael makes this sequel not scary at all.  If they wanted to recapture the feeling of the original, no one should be expecting him to be coming.  The storyline for this film already sounds like dogshit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting for a next Halloween movie YEESSS!!!!!üòÅüòÅüòÅ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Destiny I agree they BETTA NOT LET MY BOI DOWN!üòéüòéüòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I kinda like that Michael and Laurie aren't brother and sister anymore. Because that didn't happen until the sequel, so without Halloween 2, which I still like, Michael started stalking Laurie because she dropped the key at his house. So he stalked her for no good reason. And I find that truly scary that he tried to kill her for no reason, and no reason is just scary. And now after 40 years, he's coming back for her, and again, for no reason. Like the line in Scream, it's a lot scarier when there's no reason."
ek1ePFp-nBI,how can a sequel and the original movie have the same title?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This man dropped a handful of teeth. That is the most fucked up thing I‚Äôve ever seem in a trailer. I cant wait to see thisüòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:21 why does Michael resemble a ghost?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can live with them ignoring that one cause that film is so shitty it's for me painful to watch
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:07 ... is that a set of trick or treaters wearing the ‚ÄúHalloween III‚Äù masks?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael, you've been scaring the shit out of me for the past 20 years...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,That soundtrack sounds awesome

ek1ePFp-nBI,Sorry but this series just isn't the same without Donald Pleasence.(R.I.P)
ek1ePFp-nBI,R.I.P Donald Pleasance. He was a great actor.üòû

ek1ePFp-nBI,He been trying to kill his sister for decades
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer gave me chills just hearing the original score. I am psyched to see this new direction they are going with. John Carpenter on board as executive producer gives me hope.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michel returns
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh i thought he killed her ass then dropped her off the building lol wtf

am i the only one who heard a ""noot noot""?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,:( Even though they got the original actors in the first ever Halloween to play Michael and Jamie lee Curtis back to play in this one I can't help but be sad Donald pleasence isn't alive to be in this he was a great actor and really helped make this movie what it was
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey, it actually looks good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,15 million views and I'm reasonably sure 14 million of them are from me. I cannot wait for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Home sweet home Michael.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Rob Zombie made the best remakes ,they should had let him make the new one too"

ek1ePFp-nBI,She died though in h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,It was Vince Vaughn this whole time what!!!!üò≥
ek1ePFp-nBI,This ignores all of the sequels made in the past
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the Halloween theme music as much The Exorcist one.. üòçüòçüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie Strode died n Halloween resurrection after Michael stabbed her n the back on the roof of that mental institution????
ek1ePFp-nBI,With Avasva plans doing something like that was easy.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is grandma finna one pump someone?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Some questions I can't wait to have answered:
-Obviously how Michael gets taken into custody after the events of the 1978 original.

-How the documentary crew gets Michael's mask?

-Why are all those Mental Patients (along with Michael) on a bus? Are they all getting transferred?

- I'm interested to see how/if they explain Dr. Loomis' last years?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny McBride said he wanted to do  2 Halloween movies. but didn't want to get ahead of himself. he wants to see how this one goes if it makes enough money in theaters they will make another one hopefully.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Everyone go see this so they will make another one

ek1ePFp-nBI,About time they made another movie of Michael Myers with Jamie Lee Curtis
ek1ePFp-nBI,Btw she actually wanted to do this and kinda was one of the ones who had the idea of doing it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I heard papa smurf is doing a cameo...
ek1ePFp-nBI,The 78 remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,So which movie exactly in the series does this continue from? Cuz Lori died in Halloween resurrection

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone tell me when this is coming out in cinema plz‚úåüèæ‚úåüèæ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Truth is HALLOWEEN will be 100 times scary than ANNIHILATION because that film was mind fuck as fuck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why bring this back. It's dumb. She's going 2 continue to kill him. Stop taking our tax dollars 4 this shitt.
ek1ePFp-nBI,But how?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now THIS I gotta see ....so question... she's just as immortal as he is. When he stabbed her and dropped her off the building...was that not the end for Lori? Not that I wanted it to be but like what kinda witness protection plan that heffa been living in lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why am I watching this at 2AM?
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks crap!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"A. Shouldn't Michael be like 80 now?  Why is he chained outside to a giant checkerboard when it would make more since to  keep him in an X-Men style prison? Why does Jamie Lee Curtis look like the homeless burrito lady from ""Cobra Kai""?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YESS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jeez, I can't believe I'm gonna say this...I mean, I echo what Carpenter always said: Halloween was special for what it was and it should've been left alone. (Akkad's bank account be damned!). What was a simple yet superb and horrifying film was turned into a tired joke after 4 sequels (so Myers only kills family members according to the constellation because a doctor with Druid fetish enlisted him to do so. Ummm, yeah. Here I was thinking MM was a force of evil psycho out killing randomly which is what made the concept so scary.) The retroactive and stillborn H20/Resurrection was lame, Scream-lite not worthy of the Halloween name. The Zombie films are fine on their own but abominations compared to JC's original. Really the ONLY good sequel was the Myers-less 3,...but...

Damn, does this look good! Granted it's still just Michael hacking up teens but it truly seems to be trying to get back to the spirit and atmosphere of the original (yeah, EVERY sequel's filmmaker said that but this time they appear to have achieved it). Hell, a few scenes in this trailer gave me chills! What the hell? I don't have super high hopes for it but it's the first time since Halloween 4 that I've truly been looking foward to a Halloween sequel! (Never though I'd say that.)

So glad they ditched the ""sister"" angle. Always hated that!

This is the ""true"" Halloween 2 but I frankly hope it's the last too. If this movie turns out to be half as good as it looks in the trailer, let's let the Halloween series close on a high note and not drag out more unwarranted sequels. Ok?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What the fuck happened to that kid at the end???? üòÇüòÇüòÇüò• 2:37
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mi cumplia√±os es el 31 de octubre

ek1ePFp-nBI,Seeing this trailer makes me hard thinking of the night I watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm not excited for the part when he pulls out the mask in the theatre all those fuckers laughing and shit will be loud asf
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks so GOOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can he finally kill her so we can be done with this nonsense?

ek1ePFp-nBI,im in two minds about this since any new movies in long running horror franchises in recent years have been really bad
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait to watch it!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The song at 2:00 was like in the Phoenix Wright game
ek1ePFp-nBI,at least they brought back the original music.  that's a big plus.  In my mind i'm not going to associate this with any other Halloween's so I can judge it just on its on.  Trailer looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 Years later
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is back to snatch her crown as the rightful reigning scream queen.
ek1ePFp-nBI,An old Michael Myers mask? Seriously? The only thing missing is Johnny Cash music.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who is watching this in the toilet?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Call Of Duty Black Ops Zombies music??????
ek1ePFp-nBI,It actually looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween (Rob Zombie) and scream were my First horror movies, I remember scene where Michael killed boy in the forest with log. I could¬¥t sleep for weeks and now as 19 year old I am so hyped for movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, a true sequel to the original... Looking at you Halloween 3. You know what you did..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is gonna be good, can't wait!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoever are those 8.3K dislikers are just douchebags who cant give some credit to old horror movie characters getting their new movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,BRILLIANT ALREADY!
ek1ePFp-nBI,ANOTHER ONE?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Micheal is a 60 old man now??? He is good for his age üòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Fake
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like since they're bringing back jamie Lee Curtis its gunna be good and has a very old school feel but at the same time she's old af now and will be limited to what she can do. I think its stupid how They're basically just rewriting the story and modernizing it though
ek1ePFp-nBI,Surprise score second uyhuu since carbohydrate recognition skill factor drinking largely likely.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay but why didn‚Äôt they bring back Daniel ? She was her daughter in the original ones , why not bring her back to play her daughter in this one! Not even as Jamie but you know it would of made us fans happy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween makes the purge along with other horror films that been comin out lately over the years look like childrens films
ek1ePFp-nBI,*So it begins...*
ek1ePFp-nBI,This wont be as good as Zombies version ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚ÄúI watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room, staring at a wall; not seeing the wall, looking past the wall; looking at this night, inhumanly patient, waiting for some secret, silent alarm to trigger him off. Death has come to your little town, Sheriff. Now, you can either ignore it, or you can help me to stop it.‚Äù"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"REMAKE OF A REMAKE, WTF"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think I just pissed my pants in excitement. And did anyone realize that he was looking in a mirror in the window scene
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE QUEEN IS BACK
ek1ePFp-nBI,meh shit movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh no he's back. Michael Myers is my favorite go to horror movie during Halloween time and when i am in the mood to get scary while watching a horror movie. I will be in the theater ready to watch this movie and get scared at the same time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,how can you not watch it tho?
ek1ePFp-nBI,When he killed the chik in the bathroom an masked up then the music kicks in I got a shame full feeling in my pants....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"hes waited for this night, hes waited for me, ive waited for him,while he was waiting for me as ive waited for him while he was waiting on me waiting on him to wait for me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Completely unnecessary
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she already killed him like 3 times
ek1ePFp-nBI,overly dramatic old lady ruins it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dang this fool ain't dead yet he been alive since I was born in 1979
ek1ePFp-nBI,"why can't they just use the original mask, all these other ones kill the vibe..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So two old fucks are about to duke it out one last time?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Urgh. Teeth scene. Creeps me outttttt
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooooo all the sequels even H2O are being ignored with this film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The '78 Halloween has always been my favorite horror film. I remember catching it on tv when I was nine for the first time right around the part that Laurie goes to investigate what happened to Annie. I was not the same for a few days. At that age, I actually thought that instead of Michael ""coming back to life,"" that there were multiple killers all with the mask on. I am so excited for this film. I really hope it has the same ""aura"" as the original. I guess only true Halloween fanatics know what I'm talking about when I say that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,With Avasva plans doing something like that was easy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This time it‚Äôs personal
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie has the potential to be complete shit or be a good callback to the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Mask is scary enough !

This trailer has only in 1 week and those few other days since it released far more hype, view and likes than all those movies had in this time. Not to mention its Facebook views. 

It had 12.5 million views in 5 days in YT while the trailer for ""The Nun"" only has 9.3 million views in YT on its 5th day and 7.6 million on FB. This is probably is going to be the 2nd most successful R-rated horror movie behind IT (2017)."

ek1ePFp-nBI,wtf
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like a return to form.  Hope that's the case. No more trying to be hip or experimental with these movies.  Just give us that creepy son of a bitch stalking the innocent residents of Haddonfield.

ek1ePFp-nBI,O
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Lori was killed in Halloween Resurrection.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If it's part of blumhouse expect that it will be scary and explosive  as he'll
ek1ePFp-nBI,yo i thought lorie died?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"There's a good chance that Michael is still Laurie's brother. They could be ""ignoring Halloween 2"" because near the end of that movie, the fact that Laurie is Michael's brother is revealed. If you recall, that information was never supposed to be revealed to Dr. Loomis. The new movie can go off the premiss that the lady that was sent for Loomis with the police officer kept her trap shut as ordered (and lets be honest, only a person with a proven track record for keeping their mouth shut and following orders is given that job in the first place). They could then use the big reveal of them being related as a plot point/twist in the new movie but I don't believe that is the case. In the trailer we also see Laurie training and preparing for what she seems to think (or hopes) is an inevitable show down with Michael. If she just happened to be one of the kids living in his old neighborhood the night he returned to commit his murder spree, this type of behavior wouldn't make much sense. Sure, she could be some off the reservation (ah la Tommy Doyle in 6) weirdo who was so traumatized by that night, she became obsessed with Michael and never truly moved on from that night even decades later. She wasn't renting a room near the Myers house collecting every newspaper and online article about Michael she could find. She has children and grandchildren and her own house. In that house is what appears to be some kind of hidden arsenal/panic room hidden under her kitchen island. In my opinion, they are ignoring or claiming to ignore the second movie to avoid the way people initially found out about the relation of Michael and Laurie. Maybe it is something revealed only to Laurie that night or shortly after when she turns 18. Michael could have known that was something she would learn on her 18th birthday and wanted to get to her before then and before her guard was up. Maybe it was something kept between Loomis an Laurie for the same reason it was kept secret in the first place. For the protection of her and eventually her family. Her daughter may have had to deal with some intense bullying or rumors but 40 years later it is believable for the granddaughter to be able to brush aside such a rumor. Especially if she herself didn't believe it to be true. Maybe the big reveal of the relation is made to the daughter and granddaughter after his escape after decades of denial by Laurie herself. I just don't believe all of the obsession and preparation by Laurie makes much sense if she believes she was just a random teenager who happened to be lucky and got away that night. No matter which way it goes im excited to see what this production group has for us and im almost certain we wont be disappointed. Thanks for reading."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"what bullshit excuse are they going to make for him being on a bull, let alone a bull that crashes? Does he need to be transferred for some reason after ""40"" years? I am all for realistic horror, infact I prefer it to the supernatural stuff, but the convenient (or unconvenient) bus crash thing is going to urk me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:06 Jurassic theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CAN'T FUCKIN WAITTTT
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:49 - 0:59 Jurassic Park?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So pumped, but why the fuck is there British people in it? Kind of kills the whole American small town vibe the originals had."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I never really gave horror films a shot. This one might convince me, can someone explain why I might want to ignore my usual aversion to fear and watch this film?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok enough is enough already! Die already Michael GEEZ!!! Next will be ""HALLOWEEN : The Retirement"" (where they're both going after each other in a Nursing Home where both are on the edge of death's door killing off all of the residents in their path as well) and the very last of the whole series will be ""HALLOWEEN: The Resurrection of Michael"" because finally he was killed once and for all in ""The Retirement"" or was he? üòµ Ugggggg!!!!!  Sorry to say but after Dr. Loomis died (the legendary Donald Pleasence) that was the end of the Halloween sequels series for me. Love it all but come on truly enough is enough."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it just me or does he look like the guy from CSI???
ek1ePFp-nBI,I literally watched this twice because this so satisfying the part with all the trick or treaters was my favorite part
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like Rob Zombies remakes. They go more into detail why Michael was so twisted as a kid and the killings were very brutal. This however is where it started and will always be my favorite. When you have something as good as this, there‚Äôs no need for shit special effects. This will scare the shit out of you more then anything today because of how realistic it is. Michael Myers will always be my favorite horror character of all time."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait looks awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i will show it 
now"
ek1ePFp-nBI,this trailer isn‚Äôt very promising and yet i‚Äôm still so excited to hear that familiar soundtrack revamped and evil incarnate return to haddonfield

ek1ePFp-nBI,Incredibles 2 has really ditched old school animation.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I never looked at the first Halloween as a horror, more like a heavy and scray suspense. That always made it good. I hope this is a true sequel like two and 4 was. 4 was the closes to 1&2 oit of tje entire series. Except for the mask."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Time to Watch all he Halloween's again

ek1ePFp-nBI,How tf does this reboot actually look sooo good?
ek1ePFp-nBI,To me the entire concept of Michael Myers is so much scarier when it‚Äôs just him killing no explanation to it I love how they r taking him back to being a force of nature that defies logic or reason is so fckin dope can‚Äôt wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael has been shot multiple times with a shotgun before plummeting into a well.
He's been stabbed, set on fire, blown up and been shot in BOTH eyes."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sooooo many unanswered questions in this series!
What happened to Laurie's son from H2O?
We know what happened to Jamie immediately after giving birth."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've watched this trailer like 100 times this past week, it looks SO DAMN GOOD! Also you got to love how Michael is in the bathroom like ""It's okay, I'm a dentist."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Without a doubt the scariest parts.

ek1ePFp-nBI,The part where he drops the teeth is bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be good cause i remember the first horror movie i ever saw was Halloween cause i got it on a dvd for christmaswhen i was five. This better not disappoint.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So where is the SWAT team? Oh there on a  coffee break? Might want to tell them every one is getting murdered. Just saying....

And now finally there is Halloween, and Halloween

ek1ePFp-nBI,here for it
ek1ePFp-nBI,they‚Äôre going to mess up this movie just like every other iconic movie being made currently
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 3 was the only good sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,it comes out on my birthday i love all the halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hate to be the voice of sharp criticism but being a huge Hllween fan it seems inevitable.
   One mistake up front. If you don't want your movie to be a one weekend B-movie, here today and gone next week you should make sure the dialogue is discernable. A bunch of scenes flash by and I'm lost, I can't understand what the characters are saying. 
   Second I'll say, I understand that they don't want to do the same thing, the same way and just make a repeat of what has been done before. That being said, you also don't want to lose the formula of a winning combination with too much reinvention. You have to stay true to some basic foundational elements and not throw them over like the Bond films have been attempting to do in recent decades.
   Here's the critique: It looks like they're trying to make ""Dirty Harry meets ""Psycho on the loose"" so they can appeal to a savvy new generation. (Now don't get me wrong, I know they've tried hard and it is hard. I'm not trying to kick the production in the teeth). 
   It looks like they've tried to turn Michael Myers into the thinking man's killer. If there was the one successful point about Michael Myers, it was his blissful absence of reason. He acted with purpose of which the audience knew not its origins. That drove his subtle rampage to heights of unimaginable terror. That chemistry should not be lost.
  In retrospect; a strong performance of a thinking man's killer is Richard Burton's performance in ""Hammersmith Is Out"". Although the film overall lacked in other areas.
   I predict I will probably give Halloween a thumbs-up for strong action sequences, with a marginal for various minor flaws. - LOLOL, LOLOL, LOLOL !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My Favorite all time horror Movie.A true Classic Dont Fear The Reaper.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Get ready for Halloween üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,How much you wanna bet that at 2:37 that's not really Michael Myers? Someone pulling a prank?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The fucking teeth
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should have had William Shatner play Michael...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought he died or some sort? seriously i see michael series and everytime i thought he died or butchered horrendously and now hes alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh, ffs...not another one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hop she chops his head with an axe like the in the older movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cya Rob Zombie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many of this bull crap movies can they make. He never dies blah blah blah. Reality is we all going to end up in a hole and no one can change that so yeah keep fantasizing and watch unrealistic crap like this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In case you forgot, Trump is our president man and it is 2018."

ek1ePFp-nBI,The ultimate boogeyman is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OMFGGGG

YEAAAAASASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I NEEDDD THIS IN MY LIFEEEE"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So we're supposed to believe that Michael Myers is a crazed psycho path stalking Laurie Strode for the last 40 yrs till her death. Because????????? The plot made more sense in Halloween II as Laurie was the last remaining sibling of the Myers family which gave purpose to why Michael wanted her dead. Don't forget, John Carpenter co-wrote and co-produced Halloween II so I don't know why Carpenter felt it was good idea to change a key plot point set back in 1981."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope this makes up for the Rob Zombie bs
ek1ePFp-nBI,"God damnit it looks good but I hate the recon on Laurie being his sister, at this point that is integral to the Halloween DNA."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok sooo she didn't cut off he's head??!!!üòí
ek1ePFp-nBI,God this looks like total crap no one remembers Halloween H2O obviously he didn't spend 40 years in prison you got to stop with the Jamie Lee Curtis let Halloween progress on its own for future Generations and I don't mean that Rob Zombie garbage and I was a huge fan of the original I own the movie part 2 was okay but the way this is looking to going to end up with Halloween 3 Season of the Witch hahaha now that was some real crap and let's not forget Halloween four  Halloween 5 Halloween resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,It better be good. We've been waiting for years. Pls don't mess it up
ek1ePFp-nBI,m iso temblar de miedo ese trailer solo el trailer  no quiero saber como seria la pelicula

I‚Äôve been wanting this for years and I can‚Äôt wait to see to get answers üò≠üò≠ (don‚Äôt be mean in the comments)
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:29 wait wait wait Laurie didn‚Äôt have a daughter only a son
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wow that is the best Michael has looked in decades,  cannot wait"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49......It was the body of the dead reporter that Michael used to break open the door.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Shouldn‚Äôt it be Halloween II
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hello old friend Michael :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers looks like Mickey Rourke after he had Surgery ....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck no
ek1ePFp-nBI,Keep in mind Myers he does not kill kids he only kill laird and babysitters
ek1ePFp-nBI,If I'd be awaiting a boogeyman I would at least get myself an automatic rifle
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope we get to see Michael Myers vs Jason Voorhees movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't think it's Michael under the sheet. There's blood under the chair. I think it's a body.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else think that the new mask kinda looks like the original Halloween II mask? I think so!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has to be the most viewed halloween trailer of all time...maybe the movie will become the highest grossing of them all.. .
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's the last man standing Jason and the rest are over i never would've thought so. Keep it coming Mike but man we are desperate for some new characters my goodness !! üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANT WAIT

ek1ePFp-nBI,Killed 3 teenagers....  More kids die every month from school shootings these days. Sad as fuck. üò•
ek1ePFp-nBI,The king of horror is back bitches
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ham-fisted exposition, nonsensical plot details in a movie that seems to have an otherwise serious tone, I can already tell this will be a train wreck"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im down.. cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is coming and boy is he pissed off.  They had to write Laurie Strode being this tough and well trained because she'll need it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this is as good as it looks would be nice of these people would take charge of Freddy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,for anyone confused Lauries grand daughter said Michael isn't Lauries brother because that was not known until halloween 2 which never took place in this reality.So in this movie only Michael knows
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok Michael is gettin a new movie but wut about Jason and Freddy
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've officially watched this more than all of the Infinity War trailers combined.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Respect to Jamie lee because she is older. But she still took the role to make it feel like all the original ones when half of us where kids. Love her !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Michael Myers. Born October 19, 1957. Killed his older sister October 31st, 1963. Killed three high school students, October 31st, 1978.

ek1ePFp-nBI,If you love Halloween add me on snap @dustin_lamb :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the FOURTH time they've titled something in this series Halloween 1.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If she‚Äôs really not his sister then why he‚Äôs trying to kill her so bad ü§≠ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So Laurie Strode is now Sarah Connor? The trailer told me the entire story. Reporters go and bother Micheal with his old mask, Myers escapes and kills them, gets his old mask and goes back to Haddonfileld to kill Strode and other bystanders for whatever reason. She isn't his sister now and there's no curse so who knows why he gives a fuck. At the end they'll leave it so there's a possibility for a sequel. Now you don't have to see it. Fuck them for ignoring part 2."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Badass grandma action in a horror movie....
Well i mean, it's original i'll give them that"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wish they would have gone back to the beginning though, and delved deep into the Michaels mind as a child or even before when his mother was pregnant with him to see what it was like for her when she gave birth? Perhaps she was raised by a crazy man the. Gave birth to Micheal and why did she name him Micheal? What kinds of things did he do as a toddler? Did he kill bugs and animals first? What made him the killer he is you fat! I want to know!!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis hella better than that Rob Zombie bullshit 10 years ago
ek1ePFp-nBI,O shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seriously don't understand why anyone has ever been scared of this dude in any of his movies. It's just a guy in a mask with a knife. It's scream  of the killer put a little more effort into his mask. All I see is them working super hard to try and build lower that will make him seem scary when he's just a glorified disgruntled handyman in a jumpsuit on a murder spree
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kappa 123

ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:22 iz the babysitter's bloody hand. well i guess we know what's gonna happen after the closet scene, guessing why the kids are panicking."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well isnt that just peachy
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is so fuckin gay. Scary movies now ah days are just to predictable. The bus crashes?? HOW WEIRD?. This remake sucks.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't this make Michael like at least 65 years old? What's he gonna do? Kill people with his walker and AARP card?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks decent but we all know this movie is going to be bullshit just like all the other remakes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Since Michael is in his 60s now, I wonder when he'll pop out with a walking cane!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just picture michael behind the door trying to hold in the agony of it hitting his face.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I love micheal myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"look scary but good i am012

ek1ePFp-nBI,@1:28 superb acting
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The real Halloween 3, John carpenter. Zombies version sucked, it concentrated to much on violence and reference to Satanism. No theme music. And don't get me started on zombies version of Halloween 2"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who'da thought that a mask of Captain Kirk aka William Shatner would become a cultural icon for evil :) :)

ek1ePFp-nBI,When guys?
ek1ePFp-nBI,...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this real or fan-made?!
Also I wonder if that is the original mask. Hollywood does keep hold of props so maybe it is."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Micheal
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So glad to see the dark neighbourhood environment with all it's glorified possibilities for a human serial killer. Let's throw away all the garbage in between the original with it's men in trench coats, cult leaders, surreal bullshit plots, Busta Rhymes kicks and all of that crap. Hope this is the true sequel to this convoluted and messed up series. The movie deserves to be put to rest with a decent follow up and finish!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is on a giant chess board.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoaaa I thought the sister was dead on resurrection. She faked her death I guess and came back for revenge to kill micheal
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's devoe!!! Que the flash.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Then 20 years after this they'll make another Halloween that ignores this one and all the others and brings Jamie Lee Curtis back again and they'll call it Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did all the 10s of sequels suddenly not exist anymore?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The person who made this shouldve made jeepers creepers 3
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so fucking hyped for this movie man fuck the incredibles i can wait till this comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great to see Jamie Lee again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks exciting can‚Äôt wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by daylight ? Michael myera
ek1ePFp-nBI,"that 0:00 is straight up ear rape dude, even the hollywood doing it too now *OpenEyeCryingLaughEmoji*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Goosebumps came about !!! üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,They're still making these? Why?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is Meyer her EX? What's their connection? Can someone explain?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope that michael will kill Laurie and won‚Äôt get shot up but 1 billion cops or some shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Mike Myers is gay as shit. How many movies is he gonna be in before we get a proper Elm Street reboot? Some dude walking around in a Shatner mask with some kitchen knife and he can't be killed or some gaylord shit. The hell does this guy do all day, sit around in the mask jerkin off or staring at a wall waiting for his next kill? What a boring waste of a life son. Gettttt the fuck out of here."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will they touch on the fact that he was immortal
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am looking forward to this, but it kind of doesn‚Äôt tally up with the series. Didn‚Äôt she chop his head off? Then he came back and killed her? .. It‚Äôs gone the way of the Highlander franchise."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't know who looks scarier, Michael or Jamie Lee Kurtis. ü§î"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He simply just does not die.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Great idea, go to the psychopath and tease him LOL!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:13 i thought john wick was the boogeyman
ek1ePFp-nBI,How Laurie stroke still alive ??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The hand at 2.22 belongs to the girl at the end that was asked to close the closet door, I can already tell it is going to be a good killing scene."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal's Birthday is on October 19th.. I see what you did there!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"dis bitch thinks she can kill mike, cute"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:41

ek1ePFp-nBI,Plz release in Indian languages !!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please dont kill him.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am coming for you under the shining Moon
ek1ePFp-nBI,No thanks. Played out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,why is that gilf as crazy as the killer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"that one scene is just stupid even in a horrorfilm where one can get away with some pretty stupid stuff, a British filmmaker getting a hold of the original mask a deranged mentally ill patient used while on a murder spree 15 years ago from the police evidence in America, and then getting permission to walk up to said patient and present said mask to him out in an open courtyard like that, in what universe would that happen?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Don‚Äôt let us down with this remake they are usually shitty and if this one is even good compared to the originals then maybe they‚Äôll have a chance at remaking Freddy Krueger, Jason voorhees, chucky and ghostface"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why are they fuckin with Mike you really want them problems.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are they going to ignore everything that happened in the other movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:02 _Evil Within III intensifies_

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it a rob zombie one?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't jamie Lee's character die how is she in this

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait....I thought Jaime Lee Curtis chopped his head off in H20.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stop remaking movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good. Its not a cheap remake.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus Christ Hollywood are you that Fucking LAZY? How many remakes are you going to do? What a bunch of talentless Douchebags!!! 2 THUMBS DOWN

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is freaking awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The GOAT üêê returns to the big screen!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait till this comes outüòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have been a horror fan for so many years that nothing excites me anymore. But I am excited for this. This has my blood pumping. And I think JLC looks fantastic for this part, just like a jaded old codger who lived through hell as a kid and spent her life preparing this day that may never even have come. Awesome"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait to see how they retcon Laurie's death at the beginning of Halloween:Resurrection.

Or is that one on the ""pretend it never existed"" list, too?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This may be a dumb question but does this mean the story continues after Halloween 2 and 45678 were just fan fiction? Love the series and am super pumped for this but confused by the ‚ÄúMichaels been in captivity for 40 years‚Äù part still? Regardless, CANT WAIT."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn she aged horribly, like spoiled milk. White people smh"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He better kill her in the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,i dont beleive in no niggah boogey mans
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope this movie will be in my top 5 list with the conjuring 2, annabelle creation, insidious...  The trailer looks wow! üòÖ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,woah
ek1ePFp-nBI,is this the one that myers dies for real?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"With Halloween 2, Rob Zombie's Halloween 2,  and Halloween (2018), I think that this franchise might hold the record for the most Part 2's in movie history. After this movie comes out  there should be a poll asking which second Halloween movie is the best. Halloween H20 is more like a part 3."
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEASHHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hollywood is dead
ek1ePFp-nBI,I looooove Halloween I binge on these movies around October. His janitor boots gets me every time. üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have no interest in seeing a grandmotherly Jamie lee Curtis wielding a gun
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope this doesn't disappoint. I love this series
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's been 40 years so buzzed when I was a kid I used to walk like that IDK why ??? and can someone tell me why I just got sleep paralysis??? And as soon as I was typing that it just started raining ???? I know michael Myers isn't real and is just a movie but that was like paranormal and now it just stopped raining ??? Really scared I'm just gonna watch some happy videos now :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,why the fuck he just doesnt die....he is some kind immortal ....
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like it when actors are able to do one last Hoo-Rah while they still can. I hope Ms. Curtis knocks this performance right out of the park...and good for her.
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOL IDIOTIC
ek1ePFp-nBI,My life is complete. üíïüíï
ek1ePFp-nBI,glad carpenter got this series back on track this looks really good

ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone has got to make a parody of this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,the babysitter at the end dies because 2:22 you see a yellow sleeve bloody reaching for the stairs
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If I was gay, 2:35 is how I'd like to come out of the closet!  ^_^"
ek1ePFp-nBI,i was becoming interested until i heard *‚Äùyou don‚Äôt believe in the boogeyman?‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Äù* and i had to laugh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cx in the chat boys.
ek1ePFp-nBI,glad that i was born in october
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why am I watching this at 2 am
ek1ePFp-nBI,Won't be the same without Donald Pleasance somehow
ek1ePFp-nBI,Soo I thought she died.  I guess neither ever die ..
ek1ePFp-nBI,About time...should be a great Halloween üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who gets the chills but at the same time loves that michael myers instrumental
ek1ePFp-nBI,"no zombie

all shite"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is tooth fairy, halloween 1, H2O, rob zombie's remake,Charles Bronson' death wish, the fugitive, el chapo Guzman and Annabelle roled into one üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dear Blumhouse,

In 1998, the Halloween franchise was given the perfect conclusion with H20. Then Dimmension fucked it up by making Halloween: Resurrection, an abysmal film.

You guys have the chance to once again, give the franchise a proper finale. Don't screw this up!

With that said..this film looks fantastic. Hopefully this film not only washes out the bad taste Resurrection gave me, but also the Rob Zombie films."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie Strode died in Halloween resurrection when Michael fights Busta Ryhms. Didn't he stab her and she fell and died?
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAEL COME BACK !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssssss.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like they're going back to their roots :) the last two editions left much to be desired ESPECIALLY the last one made in 2009. Don't get me wrong though the 2007 Halloween was pretty good, but not compared with the original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,JAMIE LEE CURTIS ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Did anyone else LOL when he appeared in the closet? I was like there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs in there it‚Äôs too obvious, how many times would he let her close the door on him anyway?? And then there he fucking was CLASSIC üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok so who the f*ck murdered all those other people IN AN IDENTICAL MASK if homeboy was locked up for 40 years ???!!! Anyone...anyone at all??? Or is it simply ""in the script""?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis ?! This shit gon be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good trailer looking forward to the full movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bu hallowenin kacinci serisi?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I can‚Äôt wait for this!! This is the only horror movie that I love but am absolutely terrified of at the same time
ek1ePFp-nBI,I saw Laurie strode die how can she still be alive?I'm confused
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Part 3 is a pretty good film and no he's not in the film but so fucking what, back than they had killed the monster in part 2 than in part 3 they tried something entirely different for which I applaud them for trying, the idea was each film was gonna be a different kind of monster and sadly it failed at the box office. Part 3 is so worth a watch in fact part 3 gave me more nightmares than any of them did, what can scare the fuck out of a kid more than going for candy on Halloween and getting taken over by the mask they wear?  Had that film been a hit there is so much that they have done and some of them prolly wouldn't work but some of them would, so give part 3 a try. Forget that Michael isn't in it. But go in knowing he isn't."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow michael in 1980-2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the music from Michael Myers especially in dead by daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,After this I need to now if there‚Äôs a Friday the 13 squel
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is the point of ignoring the sequels if he is still going after Laurie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really really really hope they don't turn this into an unrecognizable shitshow that focuses mainly on LGBT acceptance and political morality.. please.. not Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YES! Finally the real sequel. Rob Zombies version was total garbage, thank god Carpenter is back. 
Slasher films need to make a comeback!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,in the new one
ek1ePFp-nBI,who plays Micheal Myers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie died ???
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope they dont screw this one, too."
ek1ePFp-nBI,what in the fuck does this nuthuggin cockwaffle wanna kill this year
ek1ePFp-nBI,"And sadly, this is the end of the halloween franchise"
ek1ePFp-nBI,finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how he puts on the mask and you're not able to see his eyes that makes him more scarier
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wasn't he decapitated in the last movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The mask looks good in this, and so cool to have Nick Castle, the same guy playing Michael from the original. That has to do something for Jamie Lee Curtis knowing she‚Äôs up against the same actor from 40 years ago"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you pause at the restroom slamming scene, you can see that it‚Äôs the reporter‚Äôs bloody face getting slammed onto the stall door"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Omg, can't freaking wait."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I grew up with this movie. I fell in love with Jamie Lee Curtis. She, for  me, was and will always be, the perfect woman. Welcome back Jamie Lee. She is still hot!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is the only movies of horror i will only go see at the theaters The Halloween movies, I love the older ones  i even have dreams about michael Myers and it's so scary when i wake up that I'm afraid to go back to sleep this movie is going to be badass cause jamie lee Curtis is in it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So eu do Brasil ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hollywood is so drained of ideas and talent everything is a sequel or remake. FUCKING PATHETIC.
I've already paid for and watched this movie, fucking years ago."
ek1ePFp-nBI,AWESOME!
ek1ePFp-nBI,That honestly kills the whole movie to me if they are no longer related & he is no longer supernatural/immortal or whatever. That story line was so amazing but now you changed it to a basic lifetime original serial killer movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 2 didn‚Äôt happen I guess
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this isnt part of the Rob Zombie poopie movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gave me goosebumps when the music started playing...üòµ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie died in halloween ressurection though....
ek1ePFp-nBI,2007s Rob zombie Halloween All the way!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is going to be good. Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait in the last one she cut his head off! Oh well as long as it's good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Meyers stopped being scary 20 years ago. Watching him mope around got boring fast. I was always a Jason man.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck Yes üñ§
ek1ePFp-nBI,I went in years ago with h20 and was stunned I liked it but the next one was fucking awful
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh god.... plz be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I almost crack my pants because it was so scary!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,At 2:08 don't you guys see the other person in the other window
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yowzer jamie lee curtis has aged really badly
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow q padre y la misma actriz protaginista de los 80's
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:53
ek1ePFp-nBI,When the theme started playing I got literal goosebumps
ek1ePFp-nBI,Chris Motionless..i hope you're ready.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers number 1
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks the Jamie Lee Curtis is going to go full Rambo. Hopefully not ruined be feminists bullshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone pls tell me which movie this one takes after?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie going to be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Man if Eminem showed up, who would Jamie Lee Curtis shoot first?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I never felt scared by an open closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,Y‚Äôall this comes out on my 18th birthday I‚Äôm so fucking excited I can‚Äôt wait omgggg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah!
ek1ePFp-nBI,That shit is gonna be fucking lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it just me or does Michaels mask looks like Gordon Ramsay xD?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal is Gordon Ramsay lets be real here.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:48 when you have to use the bathroom but your little brother has been in there for an hour...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:08 look at the left window, I think Michael lsn't alone."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No matter how fast you run.....
Michael Myers can walk faster."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now this ladies and gentlemen
Is a good horror movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How can u be scared of some dumbass mental guy with a mask, I could kick his ass, hes just got a knife and a mask hes not scary lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dr Myers will see you now
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is a human guided by demons helped by demons
ek1ePFp-nBI,That ending in the trailer about the Closet Door Scared me
ek1ePFp-nBI,I should dress up as Michael on Halloween just joking
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm a huge Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis fan
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how Laurie prepared for michael for 40 years. And how does she keep her sanity is beyond words
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder what teens will be dicks and die.
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,'Blumhouse' is a mark of excellence üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok one gripe How could they had caught him at the end of Part 1 one he escaped and went after her in the hospital? Wouldn't this as a sequel to part 2 make more sense????
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ph√™:))
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Donald Plesence was alive I wonder if he would have been back for this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Here we go again
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm sorry but they should of stop right at H20. I mean he got his head chopped off by Jamie Lee Curtis. That's a great ending of the series but yet they keep on making more ruining the series
ek1ePFp-nBI,SISTAA VS BROTHAA!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is Dopeüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,No one cared who he was until he put on the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks legit scary. Horror movies are never legit scary anymore, they just rely on being gross."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm going to see that movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:09 HOLY SHIT


If that‚Äôs Micheal.... WHO‚ÄôS IN THE OTHER ROOM"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween series is the best! I cannot wait for this movie to come out!
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK Blumhouse. The only reason I‚Äôm going to see this is because...well is Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why the duck does it take them 40 years to make a good sequel...
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should have incorporated Halloween 1 and 2 into this. Honestly when you watch Halloween 1 and 2 together it's like 1 long film. I like Halloween 2. The rest after that sucked even H20. I'm hoping this one is good or we'll have to wait 10 more years to see Haddonfield 50 years later. Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer is absolutely fuc*ing sicccck
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis knows how to kickass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo this better be good other wise I would lose hope on horror movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Take note guys!

This is how you make a badass female character!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maybe they will stitch his head back on again or eat his heart and keep it going forever. Lmmfao
ek1ePFp-nBI,Boy this looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I remember that Michael was taller.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Honestly though, I did love the idea of Laurie and Michael being siblings. It gave the story more depth but this will just prove that Michael was just an insane with darkness in his soul. I can't wait to see this <3"
ek1ePFp-nBI,great now i can't sleep
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just when you thought it should have been done with 8 movies ago, it continues to get worse. So now sis has been in training the whole time he's been in lock down, lol. What a joke! Stupid, stupid, stupid. I use to be a fan but never more. Let me guess, after she kills him, she puts on the mask to continue the legacy. Lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*""do you believe in the Boogeyman?""*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last scene made me jump
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can ,t believe. it he been killing people since 1978"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh my fucking god.
Another one?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My biggest problem with this is that it's just shot like every other horror movie out there...looks like so many other movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I dont like jamie lee curtis or her penis.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only horror flick that had me shook , dide was the real deal"
ek1ePFp-nBI,the 2 investigators die. btw
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They better not mess up this classic,scary movies now are such a disappointment."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween made Jamie Lee Curtis a superstar heroine and I am so looking forward to seeing this in October when it comes to the UK.  John Carpenter made an excellent choice when he chose Jamie as Laurie Strode as she was do bloody good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Hey lets Make The same movie 200 Times"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Giant gremlins meet Nanny mc fee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man I remember that music being the scariest music I had ever heard. Always creeped me out. Halloween movies will never die.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer seems promising..!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope busta rhymes comes at the end to do Kung fu on his ass again lol fucküòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg my favorite movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,So isn't Michael like 71 years old in this film? Waiting for him to just fall and break a hip while trying to stab someone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think at de start he was made fun of because of the mask and then he wanna kill everybody so that means he was a good guy :/
ek1ePFp-nBI,anyone else laugh at the ending of this trailer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,He was my patient for fifteen years. He became an obsession with me until I realised there was neither reason nor conscience or anything about him that was even remotely human. An hour ago I stood up and fired six shots into him and he just got up and walked away. I am talking about the real possibility that he is still out there.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, just saw the whole movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fuck yes!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Game over Rob Zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,He was not shot and taken to custody. He was shot 6 times then fell out the window. When loomis checked he was already gone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Universal: so we. Need good horror movie to halloween Anu idea ? 
Fans: üòèüòè"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really likes disturbing people on the toilet doesn't he?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So now she has a daughter instead of a son?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lame
ek1ePFp-nBI,Freaky Friday
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this is making me have all sorts of feels. I want Michael to die so bad üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Welp, guess who's starting the Halloween series.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"shit,he is back!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not another Halloween movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can you  close the closet door
ek1ePFp-nBI,BETTER NOT  BE FUCKING PG13
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone ask him if he's going to do another Austin Powers movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Which movies should I watch for this one? I kinda dont want to watch all of them
ek1ePFp-nBI,In his mind
ek1ePFp-nBI,Which movies should I watch for this one? I kinda dont want to watch all of them
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times are they going to bring this franchise back? It hasn't exactly got the best track record of critically acclaimed sequels or reboots
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:50 jurassic world theme starts
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Rob Zombie involvement?
ek1ePFp-nBI,a couple of dogs will kill him easily
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 Pingu üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, that theme song is so cool.  Rob Zombie, I love you and you'r movies (Halloween(Part I)  was the most amazing shit ever)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was so excited about this because it was filmed in my city
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Only thing is I feel like it's a mistake to ignore Halloween II because it was the same night as the original and they should keep the brother, sister aspect in as well!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So we are to go into this film forgetting all other halloween films after the original, no problem with that whatsoever"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He will comeüò±üòµüëªüíÄ on Halloween!!!üëªüëªüò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The darkest villain ever is back! I can't believe it! Actually I find american horror movies lame and pathetic, but this one has been a masterpiece that would make Hitchcock shit bricks."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah it already doesn't look to me 
But I will wait when the movie comes out then I will judge"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Excellent always thought Hollywood was out of ideas but cant ruin a classic üî™üéÉ

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Trailer was so good, I needed a cigarette! I walk around on Halloween Night every year dressed as Michael Myers to scare kids and it rarely works. This movie coming out this year, itll be easier for me now! This movie will be worth it!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael the Tooth fairy
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know that the movie is complete garbage when the trailer needs its own trailer in order to impress someone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANT WAIT!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Soo michael started killing at 10, escaped the first time 15 years later and now 40 years later? That makes him what? 65 years old? That is one dangerous old man!üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Never thought I'd see the day someone would remake a Rob Zombie movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57 jurassic park song?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He's waited for me, I've waited for him. Good haiku."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hollywood - ""Guns are bad!  Buuuut, we're gonna use em to make money in this movie""  haha"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow... that is an 7 out of 10 and my scale is very harsh as a 5 is ""Worth buying a movie ticket for"" and sadly this likely lost a point and *should* be an 8 but I am really jaded about A) Sequels B) Horror Sequels and C) This Franchise. Well, I know where I will be on Halloween my theater even lets me drink, see you on November first!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Subscribe to my channel for my birthday or of your dieing to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome I can't wait !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow
Cool bringing back Jamie storyline seems to be good.

Enough to get me back to go see it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why are they calling it Halloween? They will have 3 movies with the same fucking title bit confusing not original but the trailer looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn halloween is back..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm happy he doesn‚Äôt kill children
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is almost too scary please dial it back and i might buy a ticket
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can't kill the Boogeyman!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Make something original you hacks, instead of remaking/rebooting. Take risks..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hmm
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've never seen Halloween. Hopefully this is good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omggg yesss can't wait to go watch this!! Hopefully it's super goodüòàJust showed my mom the trailer too! #HALLOWEEN!!üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why Did They Use The Orginal Halloween As The Movie Title I Understand They Wanted To Be Orginal But It's A Lot Of Cool Names Out It Could Have Been Halloween:Legacy Or Something
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Michael approves
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stupid fucking Hollywood. Change the fucking record. Just keeps remaking bullshit cause your competitors are about to smack you a good one. Fucking scum.
ek1ePFp-nBI,lmao dude aint in a walker yet?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Laurie turns old now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,so is this saying that all the other Halloween movies after the first never happen?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Michael myers killed Jamie lee curits's charter off in the last one.¬† I gotta go poop
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to finally see Michael get his head blown off!
ek1ePFp-nBI,wat im a fredy jason  da columbion wolverines
ek1ePFp-nBI,Distance rumor budget ocean blue compromise relevant culture extend other
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As a Michael Myers main and to everyone else who plays as him on Dead By Daylight, this movie is for us. Happy Hunting."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is a fantastic actress. I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheals coming for anyone who dislikes this video.
ek1ePFp-nBI,A movie that will make me want to marathon scary movies at 12:00 at night alone
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The whole previous Halloween series entries to me feel like they were developing Michael Myers into a sort of slasher anti-hero and learning small titbits about his mysterious character was a cool experience. along with rooting for the underdog who gets back at this crooked society as manifestations of young adults (that shows up with they're acts: materialistic, apathetic)
it seems like filmmakers don't usually want to make an ultra dark anti-hero/slasher movie too scared of backlash? its been done in video games.
for them to take away the whole series even the good/bad bits is an easy thing for directors and writers to do these days. no new interesting ideas they could've done a way more interesting spin off however the creative movie people pay little attention to spin offs instead we get reboots/remakes.
Although i will give this a watch eventually I personally don't like the direction this movie is taking (in this trailer) actually showing where hes from takes a lot of mystery away. plus this story just looks like anti-everything i just mentioned above. looks like it is focusing mainly on Laurie strode battle hardened heroine. not the story i had hoped for as a fan.
lastly i love lots of carpenters work and also Mcbrides a good actor i just wish they would take a different direction with Halloween and expand it not trim/reboot/get rid of like so many other classic franchises (star wars, james bond, spiderman ect the list goes on in film/tv/games)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh darn
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is old but he looks young
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Rip Donald Pleasence. Halloween won't be the same without you.‚ù§ I can't wait to see this in theaters, it's going to be epic!!üéÉüëªüî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Video starts at 1:53
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If they ruin this with a bunch of fake jump scares like new shitty horror movies, I will be furious"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:44 when you take up the bathroom for too long
ek1ePFp-nBI,My first offical horror movie to watch was ju-on the grudge. Now thus will most likely be my second one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guess someone is running low on cash and/or the licence is coming up for renewal...
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòÇüëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,this film looks so retarded
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh, ho, ho, fuck YES!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wth is with all these scary movies coming out?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Make Halloween Great Again!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,@1:56 Important.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes but like isn't he old by now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,His back fuck rob zombie version we got the real version
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is he really beating the toilet door with his head? just as I like it. a michael. brutal and merciless. ;-)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait....üíÄüëÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"alright, enough"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jump Scare Music Out THE ASS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh dam a remake that looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Look, I know everyone is hyped and all but there is a good chance that this will be shit"
ek1ePFp-nBI,so i dont need to watch the movies after the original?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 anyone else got goosebumps when the Halloween theme played? It‚Äôs been so long!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,7.9 dislikes???? There will be 7.9 thousand more dead people.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why did they just ruin that good scene at 2:28 that scene is what I would've loved to see in the movie theater without me knowing prior.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit look good
ek1ePFp-nBI,So why is he after her if hes not related to her and why did he go after her in the first movie. this movie is confusing on its time line and stuff. It's stupid that they made this where there is no reason for him to get out and stalk her again. What was he her ex boy friend who got jealous or is it some guy who says I just want to stalk her for no reason.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not this shit again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mask looks awesome like the original. This looks better than any sequel made after Halloween 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,The tune is simply fantastic.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see Michael face....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"putting on the mask followed by that iconic theme  song,,,,priceless"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully Laurie Strode dies in this movie!  Amazing how she is now so tough acting!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Legendary song start at 1:56 üòÑ welcome back M.Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:11 what a fucking shot
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn Jamie Lee Curtis used to be a fine/9..





Now she a damn 2/Eww"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What a shit fest this will be
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is good and all but shit heridtary is on some other shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dame tu cosita has more views and has better cgi and quality.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so glad she came back and I cannot wait to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks horrifying and I love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhh sh@t!!! That last part!!! Is this the last one lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Miramax still lives?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""I met him 15 years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no, uh, conscience, no understanding and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this 6 year old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. I spent 8 years trying to reach him and than another 7 trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply evil!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I saw H20 when i was 11 in theatres, fell in love with  it. I share a bit of a similar story as Laurie. I know what its like to have a man come after you and you can never escape him..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a horror series with a semi decent plot segment.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many Halloween remakes are there going to be? Give it up
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So so so so....No one is questioning the fact that psychologist/detective bruh is trying to hand Michael the mask he used to murder so many people? Like why would that EVER be beneficial for anyone? That's like if all the avengers just handed Thanos the full infinity gauntlet like here you go, I want you to have this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't Trent Reznor redo the theme? :O
ek1ePFp-nBI,"P-pusheen s-s-sca-red n-now, h-hug m-m-m-me...?"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Been reading rumors that Michael Myers may be killed at the end of the movie without any ""maybe"" plot putting an end to the sequel. Hope this is not happening. And i hope this movie will never stop having sequels.. Surely the best horror movie saga of all time!

Do you agree?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This ain't that scary tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is after the original 1978. Halloween 2,4,5,6,7,8 don't exist anymore. there doing away with all the Halloween's except the original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trust me this will answer all our questions this October..They ignored Halloweens 2 and up nd focused on a new story..Well done..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Face revealed
ek1ePFp-nBI,That grandma seems to be strong and badass woman!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Aww fuck, I ain't getting to sleep tonight lol, the originals used to make me shit my pants as a kid, I was terrified that Michael would come for me... thanks mum for showing me it as a kid XD

ek1ePFp-nBI,dude hell yeth
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm scared to watch this I'm always afaid of Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,I would probably enjoy being in a situation like that and then some
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How can there be drama if she's become a firearms enthusiast and has been training for years? Mike isn't bulletproof, so wtf?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Being that is 2018, I'm surprised Micheal isn't a black guy, who is transgender and identifies as a butterfly, whom clearly hates Trump and stands up for social injustice and the unlimited flood of immigrant children across the border which would be reinforced by Micheal speaking with a Spanish speaking accent and wearing a sombrero, the knife being replaced by a pinata where he would he pound his enemies to death with cheap candy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude im honest excited for this movie it looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why can Michael stay dead ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòí

ek1ePFp-nBI,She cut this man head off and he still livin! üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Im a little confused, if this is 40 years after they arrested him and at the time of his arrest he was 20+ years old when he committed the murders, well, how old does that make him? i cants see a 60-70 year old going around killing people."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:99 when you get out of Insidious.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Me:So who‚Äôs gonna trick or treat. Michael Meyers: me 
Me:(saw a real knife) ahhhhhhhh"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This should be called Geriatric Halloween. How old is Jamie Lee Curtis??? Give me a break! Leave the Halloween movies to Rob Zombie. Can't wait until he make's his third Halloween movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favourite slashers are Michael myers and Jason voorhees so I'm excited for this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It should have been a sequel to halloween resurrection or to rob zombies halloween 2 instead
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I first saw HALLOWEEN in its entirety when I was 9-years-old. My childhood was never the same, and I regret nothing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so freaking terrified of Michael Myers but I'll definitely be seeing this in theatre lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else here the NOOT NOOT at 0:46
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay so everything after the first film never happened? Not even Halloween 2? Wtf I am so confused
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:00 when no one you know at the party
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just a reply to the commitment for Jamie lee Curtis 40 for doing playing the character so is nick castle the original micheal Myers he has reprised it for the this new film
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is want I‚Äôve always wanted: I‚Äôve just wanted to see Laurie Strode kick Michael‚Äôs ass. Also, it feels weird that this means that Micheal did this at 21, and is now going to be 61. Like, where have the years gone for the lad?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel play Dead by daylight.
ek1ePFp-nBI,AE PORRA TO MT ANCIOSO PRA ASSITIR ESSA OBRA PRIMA
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel low key dissatisfied
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else is here only because of Dead By Daylight?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Littttttttt
ek1ePFp-nBI,This horror theme is iconic and the best theme of all the horror soundtrack I heard.
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know how I know this‚Äôll be at least decent? They got a really kick-ass looking mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really hoping JLC gets killed in this movie. I know it's just wishful thinking.
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS SHIT LOOKS FIRE IDC WHAT ANYONE SAY
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee Curtis is agingüò´ that‚Äôs still my bitch tho!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"***SPOILER***



ending twist. loomis and laurie kept a secret. michael is related to laurie. this leaves franchise open for sequels with lauries daughter and grand daughter. 


***SPOILER***"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:35 I remember that I was watching this scene in other halloween movies but I don't know which one (sorry for my bad english :'v)
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 i swear thats the black ops zombies theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie is Michael!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAEL COMES BACK! AFTER OF 40 YEARS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How old is Myers now? Surely he's gotta be pushing 60 or 70.
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the most scary and feared movies and the original didn‚Äôt have one drop of blood in it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"...nahh...the only interesting parts in that trailer were the sound effects and score they ripped from the first one. It'll come out and disappear, like all the other remakes and reboots and all that shite. I really don't need to see an elderly Jamie Lee Curtis act like Sarah Connor. Just no."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I WAS 13 IN 1978 WHEN THE ORIGINAL ""HALLOWEEN"" WAS RELEASED - THIS WILL KICK ASS!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*According to what I saw, this movie will be the sequel to the first movie nothing more, and I say, all the other movies are going to the shit ?*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,yesüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm disappointed in Universal Pictures for not adding subtitle for the deaf and hard of hearing people. Most trailers nowadays are coming out with subtitle and closed captions but Universal Pictures doesn't. Very disappointed. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò†üëé
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie eat your heart out man!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This going to be awesome

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks soooo good!! Can‚Äôt wait for Oct 19th !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Insider info: Don't be shocked how he tracks down his victims, he is using Snapchat snap map."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow! This is how you do a fully fleshed out, strong female lead.We know all about Jamie Lee, her journey, her fears as a young lady, and now her strong determination at this time in her life. Not running anymore Michael.

None of that The Last Jedi, Mary Sue, I'm good at everything because. Laura ""purple hair"" Dern, so strong, so brave, because.

This looks done right, Kudos."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone please tell me please. Is this coming to cinemas? Cuz if it is... BYE (pls answer tho)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Excited for this, Michael better not let me down on this new horror film. Many recent ones are not that great"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another remake? Says something when Hollywood cant make anything original. Maybe they should focus on there craft and less on politics.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did you know..?
ek1ePFp-nBI,this better be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"they said they would include refs to halloween sequels ...you notice that the closing of the bedroom door is a ref to halloween 4  when jamie tried to close hers, the dead guy in garage from halloween 4 , toliet scene from H20.....futhermore ...on first sight ....yet again it looks like a bunch of trendy young actors you can,t give a shit if the live or die...yawn !!!...and yeah they would let the filmmakers bring into the prison the killers mask to show the killer ????....lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have watched the Halloween movies but I really don‚Äôt get then because there are so many different versions of them, can someone explain?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm 11 but I can't wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,i cant wait :)))
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Stilted, unnatural, exposition filled dialogue... hmm..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,He has the coolest theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,That ending is creepy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie seems so badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Reee
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this the sequel to after Halloween 2 or no or is it the sequel to Halloween 1 I‚Äôm also talking about the Halloween movies from 1978
ek1ePFp-nBI,"whatsup with all the horror movies, lets go."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The guy looks like a skinny version of Connor Mcgregor lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôve lost count how many times I‚Äôve watched this trailer haha. I love hearing that first piano key. I almost wanna pinch myself just to make sure I‚Äôm not dreaming and this is actually happening! Sorry guys, I‚Äôm a big fan haha"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is it possible that they could edit this movie and make it where Halloween 2 and Halloween 4 are the sequels that are not ignored but the other ones are, someone might be like have you seen the trailer it talks about Michael being locked up I know I'm thinking Sense there having reshoots they could be doing something like this so if there's a second trailer coming it could say that people thought Michael was captured that night and spent the the last 40 years in captivity, and now I know Allyson said that people made up stuft about Michael and Laurie being brother and sister but what if that was a lie that Laurie told Allyson and Karen so they wouldn't know the truth, ok now Jamie ok so they could add Jaime in the movie for a couple of parts of the movie and maybe John to. Now the part that's really confusing how Michael isn't burned well let's say while the time he had in that mental hospital someone in his family payed for a surgery for him to have like maybe his mother and the final part Michael will still be mortal in this movie.
Now guys none of this is true it's just something I want to be true."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only thing I dislike is that it has ""modern teens"", and other generic flair. Somehow I feel watching them talk about ""hurr uh like hey so uhm i heard uh that like Laurie Strode...like wasn't Michael McMyers or whatever her brother?"" Hopefully that won't be as bad as it seemed in this trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,How is he still alive after getting his head chopped off
ek1ePFp-nBI,At first I thought the Michael in the closet wasn‚Äôt Michael by some prankster but than realised that if it was a prankster than they wouldn‚Äôt have a old deteriorated mask they would just have a normal Michael Myers mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know what‚Äôs funny , this comes out oct 19 .. thats actually Michael Myers birthday.. not sure if universal/Blumhouse. Knows this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really enjoy it. Let's check Avasva plans also
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched Halloween (2007) yesterday and I couldnt go upstairs coz I was so scared Michael would show up
ek1ePFp-nBI,so is this a remake of halloween 2 then?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hahahah film sucks so bad these days , rob zombie already did these universal you idiots"
ek1ePFp-nBI,at 1:55 it gets awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Spoiler alert!* 1:28 (Look at the fridge)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I remember seeing the old Halloween movie as my first horror movie ever, I had no idea such evil shit even existed in movies LOL I had nightmares for days. So hyped for this movie!!!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,An must see an big Halloween series fan seem all the movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope he doesn't die in this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So friggin excited. I had to sleep with the light on for a few weeks after watching the original as a kid üòÇüó°üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm guessing 4.4 Imdb
ek1ePFp-nBI,*SUBSCRIBE* _MUSIC WORLD_ *CHANNEL RIGHT NOW*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait for this I need to make a video on this üòÇüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally. My favorite movie of all time is the original Halloween from 78. It‚Äôs a movie that makes you sit on the edge of your seat, it doesn‚Äôt need the hardcore gore and sex. It keeps your attention without any of that and that‚Äôs what truly makes it a wonderful horror movie. So happy to see John Carpenter back on the film as well. Getting back to the original look and feel of what truly is Halloween!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is a scary movie bc it can happen. All these other ‚Äúhorror movies‚Äù are too SciFi they‚Äôre boring and sometimes funny. Can‚Äôt wait for this one!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,But wasn‚Äôt she killed in Halloween Resurrection? See this is what is wrong with Hollywood. Do something original. Halloween has been rebooted as many times as Spider-Man.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this erases like 20 years worth of pointless sequels lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Love how everyone praises this movie to heavens.
it's 2018 ...today the filmindustry produces only movies so they can squeeze every last penny out of it so I dont expect anything good about this one.
The producers dont put their soul into their passion."
ek1ePFp-nBI,When are they making a remastered version
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:26 Not one movie has done that yet and it's annoying.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Real fans are saying fuck this
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS is the ONLY horror film I can't watch with the lights off...And I'm GOOD 'n grownüéÉüòµ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoever is fucking with this phone number is going to create slot of problems for everyone who thinks they r untouchable.... FAMILY I Got
ek1ePFp-nBI,The hell happened at the mental asylum
ek1ePFp-nBI,im so hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Less is more.  Michael should be like a mythical beast, don't have him pop up in the trailer so many times.
Also, Laurie is now some retarded heroine who is the only one capable of stopping him? This film needs that Loomis -type character."
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF!! Like this shit still aliveüåöüíñ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'd like to see it, but JL Curtis is such a twit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will have to do pretty well to beat the Rob Zombie remakes in my eyes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,the rob zombie remake dragged on. i agree with Rebelle.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm a little confused.. it looks like it continues after the original but in this one he‚Äôs still in hospital, in the original he got away after being shot by Loomis and wasn‚Äôt hospitalised again? üôà"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What if this is secretly connected to the new Freddy movie with the new Jason movie that would be bloody. I would love to see this in it's own cinematic universe like MCU, DCEU, and like the Godzilla VS King Kong that's coming out in 2020 aka MonsterVerse."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow I can't believe we're doing it again.  I actually loved Rob Zombie's 2007 remake, but it got BURIED by critics along with any hopes of future Halloween with it, but this is a whole new film. Old Laurie vs Old Michael! 
FIGHT!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,intense.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I  really hope this is the final and the last Halloween movie and that she will finally kill him at the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween scared the crap out of me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks like pure garbage and the writers/execs should kill themselves.

Poor Jamie. Getting hamfisted into this shitty movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This reminds me a lot if Halloween H20.
ek1ePFp-nBI,i think she will kill the wrong guys in mask in the end and michael still alive
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAEL WTF U COME BACK AGAIN
ek1ePFp-nBI,what time will be full halloween movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Y was there a trailer before the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If it has the original cast, like  Goddess Jamie Lee curtis, then most if not all people who have seen the first movie will go to see it again, even though its all based on the first movie, but with better special effects etc, i think the only movie which really scared the shit out of me, was the scariest movie of all time the Exorcist the original which i went to the theater to see back in the late 1970's ?  Also the worst thing was that the name called out backwards in the movie is my name as well ?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I've watched this trailer about 12 times already and it hasn't even been a week yet...im soooooo fucking hypes for this movie I'm gonna do a Halloween marathon before I see it in theaters. Omg I feel like I'm 10 again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy Sh*t Balls! 
Micheal Is Back Yal!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did jamie Lee Curtis cause the bus crash?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so looking forward to this !!  Even because Micheal Myers is in it !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie will be the Logan of Halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cool now we just need Final Destination 6, and Freddy vs Jason 2"
ek1ePFp-nBI,second reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maybe this very horror movie will be an appropriate enough for the producers of Michael Jacskon's Thriller 3D as a long-awaited 14' minutes cinema support. It's worth considering.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anybody know if it is the same Michael Myers actor from the first Halloween movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,ƒ±lk yorum TURKLER BURDAMI BEN ILK TURKUM SA A+1
ek1ePFp-nBI,Make horror great again and this movie will!
ek1ePFp-nBI,good(‚âß‚àá‚â¶)b
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great! I can't wait for this!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,plz release in Malayalam or Tamil
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seen the original back in 78 as a kid glad it was John carpenter brought it back looks like the only original actor is  Jamie lee Curtis might be using the same one as Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why was he holding the mask to the back of his head, he held it there for so long is he retarded that's not where the eyes are located m8, Myers somehow sensed it though and got really angry knowing somebody was standing behind him holding a mask to the back of his head. Maybe he could hear the mask? ... Anyway, good luck killing everyone Mick ya lunatic"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Words dear child, a thing that moves the mountains to destruction, and yet instills calmness to the ocean. Choose them wisely, for they may be hope or demise of your fellow men"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,It was doe so well
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope that if this latest Halloween movie becomes a success it will mean Scream 5 and 6 or even a new start for Scream will happen:) finger-cross
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This would be awesome if jamie lee was Michael in this movie,like a mind fuck kind of thing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so good!!!!! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüçøüçø
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like they'll finally get Halloween right for the 21st centurie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm joe grizzly bitch!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thanks Universal Pictures, Very Cool!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt Jamie lee crash Michael into the tree ? Why is he back?
ek1ePFp-nBI,who else thought the jurassic park theme song was gonna play at the beginning
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'll wait for this bull shit to come on Lifetime....fukk outta here....
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait until October 19.. This is going to be Epic...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not a good sign when you tell the entire movie - complete with prized surprise moments - in the trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm happy this is coming out, especially with those dumbass ghost movies, it's like the directors were running out of ideas"
ek1ePFp-nBI,can u close the closet door lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,Never ending wars  and same old remakes how low can we go .Hollywood you suck  make lengend of the seeker by Terry  goodkind 11 books  in that series.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally üòÄüëçüëçüëçüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow what a great fucking trailer. Super excited for Jamie Lee Curtis to come back as a (even more) badass Lorie. As soon as the music started playing at 1:57 I got goosebumps.
This looks very promising. Can't wait!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,They couldn't come up with a better idea then the bus crash?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't his mask seem a bit cgi?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doo doo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"and we sure as hell we're getting Nightmare on the elm street and friday the 13th movies, next year....*wink wink"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Freshman tablespoon high exist cause meter.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man. Why can't the come up with new movies. Instead of remaking the same fucking thing over and over and over again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder how this movie fits into the chronological time line.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally a realistic horror movie with a serial killer. Got tired of seeing dolls , demons and little kids in horror movies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg my little cousins in this movie I‚Äôm so excited to see it üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,me from IRAQ . its nice film
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are all the other movies still cannon?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,That granny and triple old g
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He attac
He attac 
But most importantly 
He attac"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie Lee Cutis dies in Halloween Resurrection.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you set the speed to 0.5 and pause the video at the exact moment at 1:49, you can see Michael's face and that it already has blood on it... I presume that the mechanic truly got fucked up by Michael for his entire face to be that bloody haha."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For some reason, this movie remakes dont get old. I believe that it gets better..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This better be good. Scratch that, it WILL be good!! The mask looks AMAZING, they're redoing everything while ignoring the sequels and remakes. The only problem is that when this comes out on blu-ray, you have 3 Halloweens on your shelf. Call it Halloween: The Return or something like that. That's my only problem."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So there you have it . We can stop with the jason comparison. Michael is officially greatest of all time !
ek1ePFp-nBI,That's gonna be a hit
ek1ePFp-nBI,How old is Michael Myers anyway ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As long as they have him walk slow but still catch his prey an no talking cause Mikey don't talk, I think it'll be a decent additional to the real series."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt kill a bad bitch!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Miachel Myers is finally backüò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,A perfect ending to my childhood.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love Halloween but Im not impressed with this trailer. It's something about the original mask that made him so scary but they changed it a bit which I hate....also, I don't like killings that look computerized"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don‚Äôt think they have done this movie right, especially if it‚Äôs with an hour and half, but I‚Äôm gonna watch it anyway."
ek1ePFp-nBI,not scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can wait for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how they're bringing stuff from number one back.  Like the sheet with the eyes or her scar on her arm.

ek1ePFp-nBI,A must watch for me watched all myers movies as a kid.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I think at this point Michael Myers, is past psychiatry. They need to contact ""Umbrella"" and have them deal with him. That guy is not human, he belongs in the movie ""Resident Evil."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,I must see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,All I can say is fuck yeah my childhood horror murderer is coming back if u were born in the mid 80s u know what I mean
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh yes

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I stopped paying attention after 2:03, that knife twirl was satisfying af lmao."

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing. I‚Äôm actually excited as a fan since the original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thank you, a real classic thats been brought back to like one more time and hasn't been remixed by any of this new school stupid shit like they put in everything else üíØüíØüíØ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sooo Halloween 4,5,6 and so on never happened? Didn't Jamie Lee die in part 6, guess there pretending that never happened"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sou,scare"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I swear , the crazy people sound like if they are jacking off to him lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Main complete his sacrifice modern pension volume uncle acceptable mostly.
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE HHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,is it just me or does the new score for this trailer sounds a bit like the jurassic world theme from the trailer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael just gave up at the end of the video... that stab was weak
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:19 Jamie Lee Curtis chasing Michael? I'm down.
ek1ePFp-nBI,micheal myers was always my favorite
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be as fucking awesome as i expect it! Idk how they can top rob zombies story which was PHENOMENAL but we shall see! Og jamie lee Curtis what about og detective??? Hmmm
ek1ePFp-nBI,How can they just ignore Halloween 2.   That was the second best one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn he can‚Äôt even die from old age?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Laurie was dead and now she's back from the dead. She used to have a son (Josh Harnett) and now she has a daughter. What the heck?
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:10 Michael is like ( Whats up mommy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this movie is... wow. So ready for Halloween!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Deleted scenes from the original https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW6_h4qqp6E
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Michael kills Laurie strode. hail thorn!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank God it's not a Rob zombie film
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok the last part tho !!!!! Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good everything after the second movie was shit anyways
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't wait for 'Halloween 2018', where Laurie and Michael are in the same nursing home."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh come on man just kill your sister :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,COMMON REGGIE GIVE US MOTHER 3
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie has become Dr. Loomis. She understands Michael and is now kinda cooky. It will be interesting
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Halloween üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she cut his head off in halloween 2/3?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are they ignoring Halloween 2 as well? Because after Loomis shot him 6 times in the original Michael went on to kill the nurses and doc in the hospital.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So does that mean that Jamie is not cannon
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one? Does Holywood have even one original idea?
ek1ePFp-nBI,On halloween...üò∂
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks like complete shit #facts don‚Äôt @Me either
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Old lady with guns vs Michael Myers

ek1ePFp-nBI,The girl at the end can be seen at 2:15 and 2:23
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM TOTALLY GONNA SEE THIS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maybe she'll decapitate the right guy this time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh so psyched!!!!!!ü§óü§óüëªüëªüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite movie of all time üòÇüòÄüòÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombies remake was the best
ek1ePFp-nBI,This dude more savage than yuntay stereo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was home alone once and all of a sudden the lights went out. So I ran quickly to my parents room with my cell flashlight .... Not because I was scared but to tell them they forgot to pay the electric bill !!! Dammit
ek1ePFp-nBI,My man Michael turning 61 this year
ek1ePFp-nBI,so glad it isn't that jump scare cash grab hollywood shit that they normally release. Rather watch these types of movies than those. ^^^^
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love how he still has the knife twirl   down packed at 2:03.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've watched this trailer like a thousand times and I just cant wait for this movie to come out! Let it be October 19 already!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so happy this movie is coming out I've waited ten long years to see another Michael Myers I'm going to go see the movie October 19th 2018 has been a long time coming  welcome back the legend of Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie versions are way better. Way to go back to crappy Michael Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT IN CINEMA
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is a treasure
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:59 That totally happened to me before when I seen micheal, gladly it was a trick or treater just creeping out people!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am happy that they're trying to build tension instead of relying on jump scares.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally no Rob Zombie bullshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,You cant forget about Halloween II 1981. You can forget about the other sequels accept this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I think we must all go to watch this movie as a big group. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm scared, just wanna make a bunch of new friends :)‚ù§Ô∏è"
ek1ePFp-nBI,II WANT FRIDAY THE 13TH LIKE IF U AGREE
ek1ePFp-nBI,they watched this
ek1ePFp-nBI,and my other sister stop baby sitting after the watched this üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,at 1:40 until 1:52 the mask sacred me
ek1ePFp-nBI,great now my sister sleeps in my room  you no why it doesn't have a closet she's 14
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too bad they got rid of Halloween 2 as a sequel. It was pretty decent. However Thank God those remakes are officially flushed away forever.
ek1ePFp-nBI,BlumHouse sure is getting popular
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:52 this moment is amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombies is best
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'd Be Really Scared If He Were Black. Right .....?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks dope. Date movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,*oh boii*
ek1ePFp-nBI,There is a second person in the window the blue room
ek1ePFp-nBI,There is a second
ek1ePFp-nBI,Tell me why I knew his ass was gonna be in the closet but I still jumped LMAOOOO
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Totally awesome attention to detail: pause the video at 2:22 when Michael looks at the house. If you look at the neck of his mask, you can see the knitting needle stab mark from the original film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,the legend is Back i am so happy for MICHAEL MEYERS :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie chopped his head off in the last one so how can he still be alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,William Shatner‚Äôs face is a horror movie icon.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Always kind of vomitous to see anti second amendments Hollywood and liberal Jamie lee Curtis using guns in there movies. God forbid we protect our selves from our revolving door of justice and unsecured borders ? Buts it ok for liberals to make a buck off of gun violence.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Is So Awesome I cannot wait for this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stop rebooting old movies this had been rebooted like what 5 times do something original for once
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers
Dentist of the year.
     (2018)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My room is dirty af Mikey couldn't get out my closet without tripping
ek1ePFp-nBI,Terror cl√°sico.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I dont get the part with the dog
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, I was extremely dubious about this until I saw the trailer. I am so excited now!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So how badass is Jamie Lee Curtis?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:37 A. she probably escaped
or
B.she died and if B is right then that must've been traumatizing for a child to see."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks better than the New Predator...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The shape remaidLooks awsome,like movies ov old!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Most badass grandma in the history
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this is basically an edgier H20 but it retcons Halloween II and takes out the sibling angle, giving Laurie no real reason to want to kill Michael.
Kinda seems pointless."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is the main reason why I keep my closet door shut before I go to sleep.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How long are they gonna drag this out for?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Spent the last 40 years locked up? Then what about all the other movies that didn't happen too long ago?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"he finds her n then sum!
he is an incest lover that wants her next.
as u wish?
she wanted that micheal didn't she, micheal 
talk"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""you don't believe in the bogey man"". Confirmed Michael Myers is John Wick"
ek1ePFp-nBI,50 ON TRENDING HOLY SHIT!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks like it‚Äôs going to give Michael the treatment he deserves, now we just need to figure out Jason"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just realised 02:11 is Michaels reflection in the mirror.
ek1ePFp-nBI,ahhh one of the best!! I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So what the fuck timeline are we following here?
Because Mikey killed her back in that terrible H20 sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So.. is it a remake or a sequel?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Rob Zombie one was off the chain... this looks real good
ek1ePFp-nBI,This u cringe
ek1ePFp-nBI,"BITCH, WHAT THE FUCK"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just not the same without Donald Pleasence
ek1ePFp-nBI,Quieroooo q salgaaa yaaa ‚ù§üëèüòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks so good cannot wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:56 original song, 1:59 original sound effect and original actors. This is how you do a sequal 40 years later"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"But he has died,  sooooooo many times now!  Lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"On another note out of the series Halloween and Friday the 13th were always my favorites, but it's nice to see they are getting back to basics. Welcome Home Micheal and Jamie Lee Curtis."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is the human thanos
ek1ePFp-nBI,The whole movie in 2 minutes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone needs to make a parody of that closet door scene.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hollween this year then IT 2 sometime in October of 2019. We gonna be haven Mike Myers and Clowns in the streets, hope yall ready for that shit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, thats sick, I wanna play Michael Myers more on DbD"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I remember Michael when I was in that asylum, what a big cry baby. He was scared of the dark, peed in his pants and cried all the time."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The guy playing myers is only 5""10 I prefer Tyler mane who is 6""9."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is it just called halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm intrigued by this new film. The first one was quite scary when I watched it when I was about 15.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 OMFG IS THAT PINGU LOL
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:08 there is 2 people in the windows
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSS I'M SO EXCITED HOLY SHIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait til Halloween returns this october. Question I always ask is why are the children still truck or treating if they know they have a maniac on the loose.ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dam Jamie Lee curtis is old as shit she used to be sexy as hell
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that a liberal with a gun?  Shame on her!
ek1ePFp-nBI,im hyped.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh dang, so awesome!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im never going near closets ever again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So Laurie's not his sister... He was captured and put in a mental hospital, even though he escaped in the original at the end, and then... with a fantastic twist of the imagination, he escapes on a bus. (probably driven by Jason Voorhees) This is great!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I need more, trailer seems trash"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Either tons of new Michael Myers movies, or he *actually* dies in this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can feel the vibe of the first 2 movies! I can't fucking wait.
Also, 13 million views in 6 days for a horror movie trailer is just spectacular. #Halloween2018"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That teeth part is so cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh look, they're going to ruin it again. Hollywood is dead."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow another remake of Halloween (Yaws)
Where's Freddy and Jason?
That's who I wanna see!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just love the music 
Reminds me of the 80s 
My parents,brothers and myself watching on a Sunday night 
Wish I could go back for the day
Looking forward to seeing it xxx
The music lol still scares me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I see he still walks slow
ek1ePFp-nBI,"that looks scary asf, I HAVE TO GO SEE THAT!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's gonna be 61 in october and still crazy as a squirrel in a nut factory :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It seems fitting that Jamie Lee Curtis may finally put Michael too rest, FOR GOOD."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one?? Are you fucking kidding me??
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think Halloween II and H20 were pretty worthy and scary sequels as well.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this-
ek1ePFp-nBI,"A little confused with the continuity. I know this is not part of Rob Zombie‚Äôs reboot series, but is it also ignoring Halloween H20 and Halloween Resurrection, which Jamie Lee Curtis‚Äô character of Laurie was in? Neither of those movies were great (H20 was decent at best), but they at least featured continuation of Laurie‚Äôs story."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks quality its got the old rawness and original tune that goes through me love it looking forward to this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know what's scarier than this movie? .....the IRS. They'll keep you up at night. üò´
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO FREAKING EXCITED BROOOO
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a Halloween fan luv it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know I'm not to thrilled about this movie either like some of you , I won't be spending my money when this film hits the screen but I will be open minded and not think the negative about it . ‚ù§"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit i almost pass out !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I did not have high hopes for this movie but this trailer looks fucking great..I'm shocked
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm here for this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sera que vai ser bom?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""The Nun"" versus ""Halloween"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry if I'm wrong, but I thought she severed his head off in the original"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's really awesome but i'm still confused. How Jamie Lee Curtis Smith still alive on Halloween: Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she chop his head off 20 years ago??
ek1ePFp-nBI,After being decapitated by his sister in Halloween h20...Ladies and gentlemen... he is back again...go Mike!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 did he hit his head on the door
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like shit and looks like the producers squandered yet another opportunity to make a great Halloween sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,6ix9ine and kids
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's going to to be a fantastic film - taking all the best elements from all the Halloween's made before it. .... I suspect it will be the best of the lot.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, we have to wait till October to watch this? üò≠"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh yeah baby I'm ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie Strode kissed Michael then fell to her death in Halloween Resurrection?   I'm glad she's back but ?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,That music make me want to twerk
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just posted a top 20 Michael Myers kills if anyone wants to watchüëªüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Night He Came Back
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back for more killing!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The jumpscare audio from the original at 2:00 and him turning his head was awesome. 

Halloween was my first horror movie I saw as a kid. I'm excited for this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm gonna be so mad if this boi is rated R
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will never be as good as the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,*BITCH IM SHOOK*
ek1ePFp-nBI,OUR BOI IS BACK!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The British guy sounds like Gordon Ramsay
ek1ePFp-nBI,the worlds angriest scientist
ek1ePFp-nBI,Commander stretch soon btbam deliver up which delay therapy wave glad.
ek1ePFp-nBI,hoping to christ this won't suck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No more ideas ?
We need new characters and new tramas"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Written by Danny McBride? I'm not sure what to think of this... even if it is produced by Carpenter.
ek1ePFp-nBI,In case anyone is wondering why She's still alive it's because this is direct sequel to the original Halloween movie completely avoiding all the other sequels as if they never happened
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a horror movie worth watching
ek1ePFp-nBI,"20 % watching this because of the movie, 80 % because of the soundtrack"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Could you imagine if Laurie Strode was Bryan Mills daughter?
 and Michael Myers accidentally killed John Wick's dog during the process???"
ek1ePFp-nBI,People putting down Rob Zombie I think his vision in the first Halloween was awesome And Michael looks like he did in his versions
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let me tell you something. Michael is the type of killer that can kill without doing much work. All he has to do with him tall/silent/evil self is walk out of a dark room, tilt his head and stare. I know I would drop my plate, I would drop my glass of milk and I would drop DEAD. Point, blank, period. Michael is OG!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good! Nothing like a good slasher horror movie! Sick of all these ghost and haunted house horror movies! üíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:59 so was this sound remixed and stolen from dead by daylight lol when the pig sees you >.<
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes this is the day i have been waiting for.I waited ages for it to come out! Im sooo excited guys are you excited?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"With Jamie Lee Curtis, talk about a Freaky Friday"
ek1ePFp-nBI,shouldGreat to see that... I made it too. Plans from woodprix helped me a lot :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Queen is back!!üëëüî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,About time they made this.¬†¬† She needs a RPG to kill this guy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welcome back Jamie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:36 

Watch my bunion!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The movie looks good, mask looks badass. But the only dumb thing is that theyre removing the fact that theyre siblings. Even in halloween part 1 in a deleted scene michael wrote ""sister"" on his door"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks like they give away too much in this trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael was hiding in the closet from Chuck Norris
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I feel like this movie is gonna have the problems that the rest had after 3, where Michael isn't a shadowy figure or ""The Shape"", he's not a force of nature, but just shows up in plain sight like in H20."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is the best and Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic!  Excited for this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,10 movie's in the franchise is enough. This looks crap.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seems legit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Put playback speed to 0.25x and keep pausing and playing at 1:49 until you notice Michael is smashing the male investigator‚Äôs head on the door...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Poor michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Strangest Activia commercial YET
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is perfection
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many Halloween fans died believing Laury was Michaels sister smh... If only they could of waited 40 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,This feels like the T2 of the Halloween series. Like Halloween 1 & 2 were essentially Halloween 1 Part 1 & 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,i wanna see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Feels like the 80s again‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is how sequels are done.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will be brilliant. It's just a shame Donald Pleasence is dead.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The tooths üòÇ(:
ek1ePFp-nBI,but laurie decapitatetd him!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is this set to the Jurassic Park theme???
ek1ePFp-nBI,im shook af
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why are so many people commenting about his fucking age? He's immortal basically, so it's fucking irrelevant..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone explain how Laurie strode is still alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,it's the third Halloween film just named Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope it's last part of Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*#1 on trending goes down to 40*
And has spent the last 40 trends, still on the list...hello Michael"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please stop!!!!!! These remakes horror-ble
ek1ePFp-nBI,I definately want to see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Releasing on my birthday! Perfect!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The bathroom scene. ""I'm Joe Grizzly BITCH!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn why do I have to wait until October smh lolz üò•
ek1ePFp-nBI,The end fucking got me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Um why is this guy still coming back? 45 caliber to the head and he's dead. Hollywood sucks!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Im always getting confused with these characters..i mean jigsaw killer, friday 13 th, Saw and Halloween they all look same.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie take notes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit imma watch it after trick or treating
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought he had his head chopped off by Laurie Strode... Unless it rolled back on.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The return of the evil...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh man it look so fricken awesome!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be the 2009 Friday The 13th style of movie. Tasteless and slight comedic. A big bore. It's not in the original story line... Lori died. Maroon Five's Girls Like You should be the trailer song by the way.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ya valio
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good god are they so inept at films these days we have gone back to this again! How tedious can it get. Regurgitate the vomit take 20! JLC was killed off in one of the films if i rem right too!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Umm she had a son and her very first kid a daughter died ,I mean I guess she could of had another kid a daughter but she was already in 40's when her son was in high school so in this movie it would make her and her daughter a lot older unless they aren't putting any other movies in except the very first one which almost sound like it I have love with more than my heart Michael Myers so I hope they do GOOD with this one but if Jamie is on board it should be okay and my fears are for nothing"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah, didn‚Äôt  Michael Myers die in Halloween H20? Jaime Lee Curtis chopped his head off. This is stupid. Slipping this one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mark fox
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now I know what to do when my closet wouldn't shut
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer looks fire. A little disappointed about them losing the brother sister angle but still excited to see Jamie lee back in the franchise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So its true? Hes finally gonna die?! üòÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Miiiicchaaaaeeellll!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Jamie Lee still got it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like what I'm seeing. Jamie Lee Curtis is awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, if this is a direct sequel to the original, that means it‚Äôs:

1. Halloween
2. Halloween

Aye, that won‚Äôt cause confusion at all."
ek1ePFp-nBI,ahhh right ill bet well written no horror fan can pass up
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well? Now I‚Äôm interested, when I first heard, thought to myself ‚Äúthat‚Äôs going to suck‚Äù but now want to see"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"India I'm ..,is it releases here"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The sound effects are so dope when Michael moves around, I hope that's a thing during all the action scenes in the film. Really ramps up the suspense!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I want that mask, its fire"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks horrible.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Jordan let himself go
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't understand 0:32 from 0:49
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wow, this is the most uninspired thing i've ever seen in my life. even the trailer is devoid of atmosphere and mystique.
by the way: laurie strode is not ellen ripley. she was a compelling character but bringing her back again and again is not going to enrich the series (which needs to die) in any way."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When I see a movie that's produced by Blumhouse Productions, I always know that it's gonna be good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hate that they changed the story. It's like ""Hey, forget every *Halloween* film after 1978 and pretend Loomis did see Michael laying on the ground when he looked back."" I mean, come on! Michael was nowhere to be found! It's like all the movies after the original don't even matter. So no Jamie, no Michael finding Laurie in the hospital in Ressurection and finally killing her. When I first saw the trailer, I was like ""Oh she actually survived! She survived the stab and the fall!!"" but no, it's all changed. So we now have a completely new timeline."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers returns #Hellyeah #Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Another fuckin pointless reboot. American Werewolf in London, It and now Halloween. FFS."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo who hype and scared for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,helll yahhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so confused . Can someone please explain to me about how the other movies don't count or exist
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:28  That's kinda funny lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,That end thO.......üò∞
ek1ePFp-nBI,Vision. üòÇ am I the only one??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee look washed! Should of at least True Lies her hair doo. Sheesh!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm still waiting for a full horror slasher blood brawl
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm gonna love this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait! Oh I love Jamie Lee Curtis!
ek1ePFp-nBI,when does this movie come out?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to illegally download this bitch!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*sigh* you cant just ..... leave him b
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT 0:57 Jurassic park theme song
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back and I would like to see the new movie  üéÉüî™üíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers is a killer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 Noot Noot ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers OP perks jesus!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The moment that the original Halloween theme started playing, I started to smile."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead By Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think he die on this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seriously, fuck decisive strike"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who played the part AGAIN and AGAIN when he puts his mask on!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*_ZAJEBISCIE_* Tylko Przeba Troche Poczekaƒá :/
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yawn........
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last one in the closet was so dumb
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mickael is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm sick of all you people beneath me saying this is gonna be great 
WHAT IF.... it isn't.  ya gonna cry and have a whinge about it on the Internet"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope I'm old enough to watch it. AND I CAN'T WAIT!!!!! right when I saw this I thought it was fanmade or something till I saw it wasn't. ü§óüòÑüòÖ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween THE FORCE AWAKENS.. get me? 

This looks like it will be disappointing as a ''true'' sequel to the original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie is about Michael Myers, isn‚Äôt it ???"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Much respect to Jamie Lee Curtis for aging with dignity and not turning her face into plastic like all of her peers
ek1ePFp-nBI,The PIANO is a CLASSIC!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"(In case yur confued) Before you watch this movie, yur suppose to know that the original is the only movie that counts. They completely disregard all the others as if they didn't even happen üëç."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Torstein from vikings?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie better be as litty as the trailer... I've waited over 7 YEARS for another Myers movie... Don't let me down John Carpenter. (Not Like You'll Read This Comment) Lol. I wanna see a Christine remake now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"at least the trailer looks like a copy pasted pattern of any adrenaline-movie today. plus what would a movie be without a cold, strong female lead. if they had any point remaking the old story besides money, i wanna hear it. expecting lots of dramatic, strong female one-liners and one dimensional swag vomiting characters. win 3 free spins if there's that good black dude saving a woman. besides, rob zombie already remaked the halloween beyond perfection so maybe i just watch them anyways."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I still haven't seen a single uh...classic?...or would it be pop? Anyway I still haven't seen any of the original Halloween movies or any of the other loved slasher. Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, Saw, or even Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I feel so left out when everyone gets hyped for these movies. I love horror but as of late most ""horror movies"" don't seem all that scary compared to playing horror games and I feel like I miss out even more when everyone else enjoys them so much."
ek1ePFp-nBI,To people who don't understand... All you have to imagine is that the original Halloween movie is the only one that ever existed. This movie takes place directly from when the original ended. Michael was captured and locked up again. All the Halloween movies in the franchise don't exist anymore. So this movie is basically the sequel in which the producers/writers believe it should have happened.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This trailer has made me want to get into the Halloween series.
And that is what I shall do"
ek1ePFp-nBI,in danny mcbride we trust ~~
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANT WAIT!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,any dbd players here?
ek1ePFp-nBI,if michael bay did this probably a lot of explosion in this scary movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Same thing happens in every film
ek1ePFp-nBI,The best killer and my favorite ever!! Michael is back!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice again
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie Lee Curtis' character committed suicide in one of the Halloween films?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone from DBD here? Thumbs up
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Crap, I got a chubby..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead Meat take notes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Heck yeah. Jizzme Lee Curtis is back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse stay with the heat.üî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,thanks ggwp
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want Michael vs Jason !
ek1ePFp-nBI,gosh...this will always be one of my faves tho.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought they would never make another one ,so fucking excited"
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck rob zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cant even take a shit in peace, jeez."
ek1ePFp-nBI,My life Just Got True Meaning!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How is Jamie Lee Curtis's character coming back when she died in ""Resurrection"". It's a new timeline that doesn't make sense, I'll watch it anyways, but the whole plot seems shitty already."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I been waiting the 15years
ek1ePFp-nBI,Talk about milking lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This must make the Halloween series the new king of confusing timelines. As I see this, they¬¥ve continued the storyline from the original first 2 movies of the series (with Jamie Lee Curtis in there it can¬¥t be a continuance of the Rob Zombie films), but completely disregarded the following movies in the series (since Laurie/Jamie dies in that series). I get that they¬¥re cutting them out because much fewer people have seen them than the original. I really hope that somewhere in the movie there¬¥s at least some kind of reference to them, but I doubt it. If you add Halloween 3¬¥s storyline, that¬¥s 4 timelines/worlds in one series. Call me old fashioned, but I think that¬¥s at least one too many."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched this clip ‚Äòcause I thought Michael was gonna end up being Mickey Rourke
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cod black ops zombie vibe anyone  after hearing that tune.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy friggin crap
ek1ePFp-nBI,I live in the neighborhood where they shot the first movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope we get some background of Myer's activities in the asylum like Donald Pleasence character Loomis educated the audience with Michael's exploits while in captivity. The blackest eyes he ever seen, the devil's eyes. I never forgot that quote since seeing Halloween at the age of 3.

LOOMIS:  I met him, fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding; even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face and, the blackest eyes‚Ä¶ the devil‚Äôs eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy‚Äôs eyes was purely and simply‚Ä¶ evil.

Also, if he was 6 when he killed, or at least when Loomis met him wouldn't he be 46? I guess they are just going with the baby sitting kills from the 78 original when he was 21. Still, part of what made Micheal so terrifying was the fact he was evil as a child like the Omen. Just a stalking soulless darkness that killed with intrigue"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's this remake trash?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gonna play Scratched Mirror (Spoopy) Myers on Lery's right now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought that Bitch died
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ah'w c'mon. It's old. The original film had all the nuance it ever needed, the perfect and genius blend of 'probable mythos' is why I loved it t begin with; _Is the bogey man real? Is Michael Myers a manifestation of myth? Or does the myth become more real the closer it gets?_ There was never any way to tell, just like we can never know whether Cujo was _just a rabid dog,_ or  the product of a series of fortunate accidents exploited (or perhaps even influenced) by Frank Dodd, a 'creature' cameo from an entirely different universe; just like we cold never _quite_ distinguish intentions between Damien Karras and the Gemini Killer, neither of whom are supposed to be alive. YES I believe in the bogey man (Halloween 1)...because I'm _still_ unsure that he/it exists or not, is just a man or not."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aaaaaa de volta
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH MY GOD YES YES HE'S BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, JLC looks TERRIBLE!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this the 87th remake of this movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,dead by daylight?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie probably gets arrested by the end, goes insane, then becomes the next michael"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAAAAAAAAAS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so impressed with the trailer. This looks amazing!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Im really confused, does this override H20 and ressurection?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"watching the movie because I'm a fan of Michael Myers, but not of Jamie Lee Curtis. Hope Michael ends her on this one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,My reaction - https://youtu.be/kRTMuihYDaA ....PLS WATCH
ek1ePFp-nBI,so this means she didn't die in halloween resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn Jamie lee Curtis‚Äô character is fucking insane, maybe she is too."
ek1ePFp-nBI,BRUHHHHHHHHH. Im ready for this . My favorite scary movie. All they need is another Friday the 13th and ill be so damn happy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Very excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am so ready for this. People just dont know that Michael Myers is part of the BIG 3.  Michael Myers, Jason voorhees, and Freddy Kruger"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Michael had a job he would be a chef.  A scary chef
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee show ur 2 genatalia !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/-ep3ftpabaY
ek1ePFp-nBI,My playing of the iconic theme song: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt9ZSnXnE94
ek1ePFp-nBI,My cousin Michaelüíï
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If Laurie Strode wasn't Michael Meyers sister, then why or what is his motivation for killing this old bitch after 40 years? Wtf? Why change so much history for another cash grab?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, This is gonna be a great movie!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"WHY NOT KEEP H2 IN THE TIMELINE? Who cares if she is Michael's sister also? This one could be a better H20!! Basically, an H40!!! How can you cut H2 out? It wasn't a sequel, it was part two of what happened that Halloween night! Throw away the rest but not THAT one!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer just flashed official trailer ?? üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis character dies in Halloween Resurrection (2002) though....but that‚Äôs none of my business üòÇ I hope they can explain this in the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That's Jamie Lee Curtis???  I've never seen her with long hair.  She's come a long way since ""Freaky Friday!"" :-)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Otha fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got goosebumps at 1:56
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Whilst I do applaud the filmmakers for much of the content in this trailer for the new Halloween movie (The return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, going back to Michael Myers origins and creating a far-superior follow up to the original), I do have some issues with it:

1) Asking your audience to basically forget what happened in Halloween 2-6, H20, Resurrection and the two Rob Zombie remakes is a lot. I do understand that they're essentially trying to wipe the slate clean with the Halloween film franchise, it's pretty difficult as a long-time Halloween fan to simply unlearn and forget about important plot details.

2) Following on from this, the writers are also trying hard to deny any connection or relation between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode being siblings. Again this is also difficult when it's been the case for most of Halloween's history that Michael and Laurie are brother and sister. It also gives Myers a genuine motive for hunting after her 40 years later. Otherwise this plot detail makes no sense whatsoever.

3) Calling this film HALLOWEEN is very confusing as it implies that this is indeed a reboot or remake of the original. They really should have stuck to the original title of HALLOWEEN RETURNS or even HALLOWEEN H40.

Otherwise, I'm really excited about a new Halloween film finally being released. Unlike some of the shoddy sequels before it, it seems like a lot more thought has gotten into the storyline and production. And unlike the dreadful Michael and Laurie confrontation in Halloween: Resurrection, it seems like it will be handled a lot better here. BRING ON OCTOBER!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait Halloween is still going to start as man lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike Myers + Jamie Lee Curtis + John Carpenter = Real Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,That‚Äôs one OP mask 0:36 - 0:49

ek1ePFp-nBI,Where all these fake Halloween fans come from
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy <3333333333
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Love the theme music, it's my ex wife ringtone"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So much respect for Jamie Curtis. Let herself age naturally. None of that cosmetic surgery that leaves you looking like a freak. And still a great actress.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Favorite Sequel of all time, yet still scared af when I watch it and I'm 21üòÇüò≠ I can't fucken wait!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to watch it I have seen all the HALLOWEEN movies and this one is just better
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jaime lee curtis is about time you show up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Myers should've made a cameo in 3 and bumped everyone off for screwing with his label. This is going to be incredible!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm gonna feel like that terrified 7 year old in the movie theatre again.  Yes, seven..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don‚Äôt know why but the woman falling to close the closet made me laugh so hard
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Absolutely love this! Thank God for John Carpenter, lets just hope the actors are as good as they look lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like a good one

ek1ePFp-nBI,yes jamie lee curtis slay my life SKINNY LEGEND!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,When you realize Michael Myers can walk faster than than you can run
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie is responsible for making that piano tune one of the of SCARIEST THEME songs ever... ""Doo...Doo Doo.....doo....Doo Doo"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,Haven't seen one of these classics in a while

ek1ePFp-nBI,I prefer Rob Zombies films
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so fucking excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,why not just kill urself and end it
ek1ePFp-nBI,why is laurie cocking a gun we all know from experience this is not how she is going to kill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this one is better than Halloween 3 The Season of the Witches.  That movie sucked big juicy cock.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:08
ek1ePFp-nBI,another one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'll watch it because I mean, it's a classic. Plus it's John Carpenter so it's gunna be good. But I'll just say that it won't be as good Rob Zombies versions."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still not as scary as when Chuck Norris's fist comes out of his beard and punches you right in the face.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's the only person I know who can have a door slammed in his face multiple times and take it like a champ!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't Jamie Lee not chop his head off with an axe at the end of the last one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ding ding ding ding ding ding 
Ding ding ding ding... the original Halloween theme music."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nothing like beating a dead horse.  Where's Josh Hartnett???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael came out the closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i remember as kid in the early 2000's watching these movies, they were always scary as shit to me the 1970 version on vhs and so forth with the rest i became fond of the actor jamie lee curtis i always wondered if she'd return to acting in this horror series anyway good actor and crazy storyline, cant wait to see what happens next damn!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Please stop ‚úã‚úã‚úã
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for it to come out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg finally my childhood movie is coming back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Listen:
I was in my younger years almost addicted to horror movies, and John Carpenter was one of my favorite directors. Flicks like ""The Fog"", ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"" was (and still is) among the geatest in its genre.
But when I got older, I asked myself ""why the fuck do I watch these kind of movies""? The answere? It was a coping mechanism for dealing with psychological disharmony and the underlying fear of death. It doesn`t make life any better watching people stabbing eachother to death, I promise you. The more junk you feed into your brain, the more you become incapable of thinking clearly about REAL LIFE.
Jamie Lee Curtis is a very good actress with alot of success, but like most actors, she became addicted to attention and fame, and some of them (like Curtis) can`t stand the thought of being totally forgotten. Only desperation and alot of money makes Curtis dive into a shithole like this, and its fucking sad and pathetic.


Ask yourself honestly and with deep curiousity:  Why watch a movie that makes you stupid, when you can read books about real life psychopathic killers and really learn something about the people that inspires moviedirectors to make shit like this. Its fucking primitive!

Wake up! :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really wish this took place after resurrection as a way of undoing Laurie‚Äôs horrible death in resurrection or after the events of Halloween 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,so im guessing this movie is set years later after the first film im still going to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,That chess board nuthouse scene is already my favorite scene of all time.  They could put a movie around that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How is jamie lee still alive when Michael killed her in the beginning of Halloween Resurrection üòµ, or did everyone forget that part??üòÆ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I knew he was in the closet why did that shit still give me a heart attack???? also yas bitch jamie lee curtis!!! that activia bout to pop off
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, the trailer started off interesting but as it progressed I started to lose interest. I'll be willing to give the movie a shot. Not expecting much."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Comes out October 19th? That's Michael's birthday ;)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Big Mike back at it again!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm taking a shit while watching this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,please die Michael please
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:47 When I can't hold my shit any longer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michele didn‚Äôt die in the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"right time to do a movie, but looks as lame as all the others, ill pass"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49
ek1ePFp-nBI,"big strong empowered woman DOES need a gun to protect her, ok."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So are we not gonna talk about Resurrection when Michael stabbed Laurie in the back on the roof? Pretty sure she fell to her death after that. ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,John carpenter  did not write the first Halloween.  He helped out a little  and asked for his name to be on it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,She died in Halloween  after Halloween  h20. This looks shit. Rob zombie we need you
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit just got real with this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 black ops zombies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike in his 80s still killin? Fuck it yolo mike
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtf is it with franchises dismissing sequels bad move when all 7 sequels are already classics this movie is an abomination just like that rob zombie trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY üò¥
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone want a revamp of Freddy vs Jason?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm cumming
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers kind of looks and sounds like like Gordon Ramsay.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Laurie doesn‚Äôt use decisive strike on Michael then what‚Äôs the point? üôÑüôÑüôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't Wait To See This New Halloween Movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why in the fuck of all fucks would that idiot show Michael his happy-time-kill-all-humans mask? That's like taking an alcoholic to a liquor store.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hello and what topic does this relate to gaming?
ek1ePFp-nBI,the 2 things that got hyped in this trailer when Michael put on his mask and his music started playing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie should be the director
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow another shit remake... AGAIN...
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movies gonna be so fuckin lit first of all john carpenter is the executive producer i remeber him from watchin the classic holloween movies wen i was younger im 25 now but loved the series and the goat jamie lee curtis is back in action im telling yall this film is gonna be the best yet
ek1ePFp-nBI,This bout to be weak asf
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie picks up after halloween 2.#confirmed
ek1ePFp-nBI,So that means he‚Äôs like 70 years old and still trying to kill people
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,@2:10 who tf cant tell its a mirror
ek1ePFp-nBI,awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can we reach 5 subscribers? ‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best hero ever !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its beautiful!!üòçüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween was the movie growing up as a kid that gave me nightmares. the Soundtrack in the movie only augmented the experience. the mask was and still is very intimidating. this movie should get plenty of good ratings and hopefully make #1 when it comes out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers the king of slashers is back!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So played..
ek1ePFp-nBI,es la ostia carajos
ek1ePFp-nBI,ok this is the only movie they can make a new one of and every time it will actually be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Rob Zombie movies were trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandma with that pump shotgun that aim tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,–û–ß–ï–ù–¨ –•–û–†–û–®–û–ï –ö–ò–ù–û
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can see his face at  1:49 it look like the guy at 1:42 so maybe michael kill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,"now this is the Michael Myers that I love!!  I did however like the first Rob Zombie
remake, but his second one was horrible.  Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, Jamie Lee Curtis is so awesome!!! Can't hardly wait to watch it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know people are thinking there may be 2 killers but I think the shadow in the window was added for the trailer to throw people off. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they pulled off something similar to the Infinity war trailer where it showed the hulk being on wokanda
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got goosebumps...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know: Slamming a door won't help

*YOU JUST GOT TO PALLETLOOP AND DROP DEM PALLETS ON THIS GUY*

if you know what i mean :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:53
From here to the end is the best part of the trailer"
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Rob Zombie Allowed!
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Micheal walked in my room and he was going to kill me I would offer him some fortnite
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can find perfect idea for that on Avasva Solutions website.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Djs
ek1ePFp-nBI,#41 on trending

Halloween 2 is one of the greatest sequels to not just horror, but to any film in general as it continues the story in a new way that‚Äôs interesting, has a great idea to the plot and although carpenter didn‚Äôt direct this one, I believe rick rosenthal‚Äôs work on Halloween 2 is identical to carpenter‚Äôs.
I‚Äôm just being weary of the upcoming film, you should to. Go in with an open mind, stay calm."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for teddyween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's interesting that they are retconning everything from halloween 2 onward. Now it kind of seems like all those movies were stories told by the parents of Haddonfield, Illinois that only serve to build to the urban legend of Michael Myers. Where as this movie serves to tell us what actually happened after October 31, 1978."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don‚Äôt let this distract you from the fact that Michael is 61 in this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another retcon
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just imagine how Michael felt though when she kept trying to close the doorüòÇüòÇ ‚ÄúJUST OPEN THE DOOR! STOP HITTING ME!‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,You guys i want to tell you something this movie is not same sequel from the other movie this movie is different you can here the radio that michael myers shot by dr loomis and take into custody it means after michael being shot in halloween 1978 then this movie is episode 2

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thumbs down to the movie. After Rob Zombie's  version you can't, CAN NOT ! Have Michael Myers that small!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,No wonder he‚Äôs pissed she hit him in the face with a door!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Did anyone else notice the other person in the window when Laurie shoots what she thinks is Michael?
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:45 is the best part of the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bullshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Without Donald Pleasence playing Dr. Samuel Loomis ,who was as much apart of the franchise as Michael Myers, their should be no more Halloween  (1978) movies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Y MA PP HARD*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jaime Lee Curtis returned for a sequel set 20 years after the first film in Halloween (H20) in 1998, another 20 years and she's back in this year's Reboot/sequel.  This confirms that she is set to return in a Halloween on 2038."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actor looks like Edge

ek1ePFp-nBI,2nd version of purge
ek1ePFp-nBI,A must see!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"John Carpenter? Really?? The same guy who made Silver Shamrock Halloween, H20, and Halloween Resurrection? To be honest Ilost interest in Halloween long ago, but at least Rob Zombie put a different twist on things. Here we go with the same recycled shit again!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Banger already üí•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Spoiler alert....he dies in the end or he doesnt...
ek1ePFp-nBI,How much longer they gonna milk this shit?.. Dam
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie Lee Badass Scream Queen Curtis, back at it again!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Can't Believe Michael Myers Is Back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"and they still ask why ""he killed or shot"" is because of these horror movies...world you can't to see how these affected your mind?!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she cut his head off in the H2O one??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not really hyped by this trailer. We'll see...
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they make a new Halloween movie but not Friday the 13th ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what do you mean ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Honestly about damn time they bring Jamie Lee Curtis back to Halloween!!! But is John carpenter directing? And this Halloween looks like it will be good!! Can't wait for it to come out in movie theaters! Any horror fanatics going to see this??
ek1ePFp-nBI,When Hollywood lacks ideas bring back another sequel or prequel of an already original  popular movie. What are we up to 20 Halloween movies and 30 Friday the 13th. They wonder why illegal streaming is still popular.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It is fitting that Jamie Lee Curtis is in this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm never closing or opening my closet door againüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So finally he surfaces !!!!!!!!!
Yes !!!!!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Plot twist...it was the sister the whole time.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I disliked cuz i shit myself my b guys
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks great. They should have made this after part 2. Would have made more sense. So I guess we just discount all the other sequels and focus on this one. John Carpenter is the best! Can't wait to see it! Oh, and, Happy Halloween......"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Scared the hell outa me. I'm sad for the one whose teeth were taken off by the famous dentist- Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have a feeling this will be decent.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs cool that they‚Äôre forgetting all of the sequels
ek1ePFp-nBI,The acting from everyone except Jodie is not that good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Must see..
ek1ePFp-nBI,So wait...I what about Jamie and her baby? And is the recent 2007/2008 Halloween movie cannon to this one? Gosh I have so many questions.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best granny ever!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"SPOILER ALERT! He ""dies"" again lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,They used the same music from dead by daylight ü§îü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by daylight ? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
ek1ePFp-nBI,does anyone know if this movie doesn't tie in with the movie where lorie dies well seemingly dies? or did she survive his attack.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Apparently laurie is not dead !
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm confused didn't Jamie lee curtis  die in one of the previous films?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh i thought it was a new jurassic park movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see this so bad like if you agree
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its Michael Myers and the music sounds also the same like in DbD
ek1ePFp-nBI,But she cut his head off last movie üòíüôÑ

ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the old school sound effect at 2:00! Michael is ready to kill!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To all of you talking about the mask, it looks as it should, it‚Äôs looks like a heavily aged and rotted Captain Kirk mask. Have you seen the original mask they used in Halloween 1978 in 2018? Doesn‚Äôt look to far off from that one. So to all the complainers that ‚Äúthe mask sucks‚Äù and ‚Äúthe mask looks like shit‚Äù. Well is what it is."

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is why I‚Äôll Learn Kung fu so I can Bruce lee he‚Äôs ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie looking  old
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow this is how bad movies have gotten.  You have to reboot films that were great 40 years ago, get the same actors, tell similar stories.  No more new fresh ideas."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Got to love how 59 year old Jamie Lee Curtis can travel back in time before her character's death in 2002's Halloween: Resurrection, and pretend like she's still in her 30's."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hurry up October 19th !!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is the sequel to the original is that right so all the other films didn't happen or am I wrong

ek1ePFp-nBI,Pathetic.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Does anyone know anything

ek1ePFp-nBI,the embodiment of pure evil is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've always wanted to see a movie about buckethead
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm trying to figure out...so is they saying part 2 didn‚Äôt happen and this is like the sequel to the original ü§îü§® Halloween 2 is actually my favorite out the franchise. I was introduced to Michael from 2 then I saw the rest. I guess 2 never happened ü§® also if Laurie is that old and Michael older then that. It should be an old old man trying to kill Laurie (senior citizen) üë¥ i mean she‚Äôs a senior citizen now but he should be a SUPER senior citizen üòÇüòÜ this doesn‚Äôt make sense...but...imma watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome to see that Unflexal  includes new training instructions to build my body perfectly.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, so judging by the trailer, I can already tell u that this is a ridiculously stupid movie... But that's ok, stupid movies are ok. So now here's what they can work with, either forget about the audience taking this movie seriously and simply make it fun and badass!!! Or... Try and make this movie serious and watch it's rating go down like flies on a nuclear cow pie... Anyways an example of this was IT, fantastic movie, however they knew the monster for the movie was far from scary so they just simply had fun with it and made it enjoyable and I think that's what they needa do with this new Halloween movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This dont scare me,but im sleeping with the light on"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want it on netflix
ek1ePFp-nBI,is this what happens when you run out of movie ideas just keep remaking it over and over? next Halloween Jamie lee is going to be chased by Michael in a wheelchair so the whole town lives up stairs ..NEXT HALLOWEEN 2019 Michael finally meets his match when his family moves into a 2 story house without a wheelchair ramp
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2040 remake can't wait, they will be in wheel chairs."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"From David Gordon Green, the director of Pineapple Express & Undertow, co-written by his buddy, the badass MF Danny McBride...yeah, this one's gonna SLAYYYYYY!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this film acting as a Sequel to the first film and forgetting about the other sequels who were ""Meh"" types of films? Sounds Promising?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another film in this series? It's probably time to lay this franchise to rest. But Myers would just dig it up and kill it all over again anyway.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fun fact: The Michael Myers mask was made from a mold of William Shatner's face.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I LOVE MICHEAL MYERS HE IS BACK

ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm glad I don't have a closet room üëÄü§û
ek1ePFp-nBI,I loveeeeeee Michael Myers üò∞üëØ

ek1ePFp-nBI,A new serial killer to be known
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Definetely stoked for this. Looks dope af, we need a good slasher every once in awhile awhile."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why is it that in every horror or thriller movie trailer, there‚Äôs always someone whispering something as the scenes transition dramatically?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wonder if it‚Äôs the same knife
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really looking forward to this because John Carpenter is involved.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Real Question Is What Happened To Her Son From H20 ? An How Did She End Up Being Alive After She Fell From Dat Nut House Building  ..n How Tf Is He Still Alive I'm Convinced That He Can't Die Like Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:45 . Now we know who the REAL tooth fairy is üò§üòñ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit looks freaky
ek1ePFp-nBI,BOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"so we get a new! halloween, jason and chucky but still not a new nightmare on elm street!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He thought that was the tooth fairy in the bathroom stall, trying to cash out"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üí©
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks hella good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Done decently
ek1ePFp-nBI,"mmm not a Carpenter movie,eh?!
I'll just wait for reviews b4 I think anything...no fan of squeals"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I shit my pants"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't Jamie Lee die in the last movie because she didn't want to do anymore Halloween movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAEL UR BAAACCCCKKKK
ek1ePFp-nBI,00:43 deki haluk bilginer mi ???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bitch why you still trying Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does Michael Myers still drive the Ford LTD station wagon? That's what I want to know!
ek1ePFp-nBI,John carpenter well done üëç on Makeing this movie well trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks terrible.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Horror as shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank you for the video. üíûüíñ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I was wondering when there be another to the series...
miss you Michael.
üî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I guess it isn't cannon anymore that Busta Rhymes killed Michael Myers in the last film before the reboot. Kinda disappointed...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck.....I sat in a cinema and watched Laurie chop his head off with an axe. 
How many more times can they possibly squeeze money out of this?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSS SO EXCITED TO WATCH THIS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Jamie Lee Curtis looks super old in this. A long way from that sexy body in True Lies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I tried to open the closet today and it wouldnt open and I was so scared i just closed the room
ek1ePFp-nBI,LIT!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:17, 0:41, 1:15

- Those gunshot SFX from the original film.
- That 1970s telephoto zoom-in.
- Jamie Lee Curtis long-hair still in tact.

Little details like this and simple nods to the original are why I feel this will live up to expectations."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet those teeth are Michael Myers teeth from all the times that girl slammed the door in his face lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,I ain‚Äôt gone lie this was my first scary movie as a kid and I got that feeling I had in youth watching this trailer today... i might pass on this MF here lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looking forward to this I have high expectations of it. Going by the trailer alone it seems it will wash away the bad taste left by H20 and it's equally redundant follow on.
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh my God 2018 keeps getting better by the minute first games no movies I'm really starting to like this year <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,But if u dont know... im Michael and im coming tonight!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing i can't wait but didn't he already kill laurie strode in halloween resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,didnt she cut his head off ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I SEE BOBA
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 is that pingu?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Correct me if I am wrong, so this new 2018 films ignores everything from H2 to Resurrection and it is meant to be a whole new standalone sequel to the original 1978 Halloween? If it is I can't wait!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess guns do protect people
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else enjoy the entire movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,You guys better not.fuck this up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its 12am and I'm watching this whyy???
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Man, I don't know about you jack-offs, but this trailer had me jacking off so hard just now to it's overly used dope ass theme song that most of it's audience probably won't recognize because they, meaning you, probably aren't old enough to know any better other than to think that it's something new. Not enough clowns for my taste though, so I'll probably be in the dark corners of the streets tonight with that theme song playing quietly behind me as I stand and stare blankly through a distorted clown mask at unsuspecting passersbys."
ek1ePFp-nBI,William Sharner is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Imagine if Micheal was the tooth fairy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hide your kids hide your wife.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lamo
ek1ePFp-nBI,what a minute IS THAT GORDEN RAMSEY BOI WHERE DA LAMB SAUCE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please stop making these. It was one good film 40 years ago, stop milking it. Nobody wants to see a movie about a 60 year old killer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, are they pulling a Texas Chainsaw 3D?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt stop watching this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Isn‚Äôt this Halloween movie supposed to be filmed by Dimension
 studios"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogeyman? Better call John Wick üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks good but I really wish they would include the second movie, it's kind of stupid to only limit his kill count to his sister and the three  innocent teenagers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,And the worse trailer award goes to (drum roll).......
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally some classics coming back we need more
ek1ePFp-nBI,Be super badass and hardcore dedication if the mask is the same EXACT ONE FROM THE VERY FIRST MOVIE FROM THE ORIGINAL SET
ek1ePFp-nBI,Those teeth were obviously his. They got knocked out when the girl tried to close the closet door :P
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myer‚Äôs unmasked

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jWf5ED_NPyI"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fun Fact: The mask is actually a William Shatner mask from the original Star Trek, painted white."
ek1ePFp-nBI,üî™üé∂üé∂The theme song is the baddest theme ever. I get chills when I hear it. Like scary omfg I love this movie.. Michael Myers kicks azz type of chills üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jake Gyllenhaal better not messed this up.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nick Castle as Michael Myers fuck yes! Danny Mcbride you got it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,God I wish scary movie was still a thing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love how the internet trolls were saying ""this movie isn't happening"", or ""they pulled the plug"" and ""here's the source"". They were even putting up links. This was only a couple of months ago too. Great, reliable sources they had. Lmao. Can't wait for this to come out."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie needs to take notes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love HALLOWEEN.. it's also my bday..üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,"im ready for this, ive played plenty of dead by daylight"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music in the trailer makes it 99% better
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't eat Activia before watching this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,ITS BEEEEN LONG ENOUGH IM READY üòçüò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so confused when it comes to these Halloween movies the storyline is all mixed up
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG OMG OMG OMG
ek1ePFp-nBI,üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•bout to be liiitüòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait! I‚Äôm a long time fan. Looking so forward!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cad√™ os brasileiros üòé.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is the most badass trailer ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,"love to see this psycho guy is back!!







and the theme song"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes October19 I'm taking my girlfriend to see this on our anniversary she hates horror movies üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hyped for this movie who else is
ek1ePFp-nBI,Him & his sister Gon be beefing forever lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I fucks with Mike....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YOOOOO AS the biggest Halloween fan out I have to first say #RIPDRLOOMIS 

NOW WHO ELSE HYPED AF FOR THIS SHIT‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit look wack af
ek1ePFp-nBI,Check out near death experiences on YouTube. There are ones of both heaven and hell. They're some of the most powerful testimonies of God. Spread the message by sharing and talking about them. Amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been waiting for this movie for a really long time
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 is epic scary scean
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dam what is this, Halloween 45"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm really curious to hear what happened to Samuel Loomis in this movie since his actor in the original movie has passed away. Did he die during the 39 years that passed or will he still be alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Could you close the closet door
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anyone know what kind of gun she's using at 1:18 ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:10 thats a mirror she shot if you didn't notice
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE HYPE IS REAL!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"There's a new guy playing him in this one? I know for a fact that it's not the same actor who played him in the last halloween they made, he's not even tall and buff, plus what's with the old mask they used in the old films? They should have kept using the same mask like in the last one, hope this doesn't fail.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why was notorious schlock factory Blumhouse given the rights to this classic series?  Blum can fuck off.
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"okay, i feel better now knowing rob zombie isn't directing this gem!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael dont die niether does lorieüôá
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's coming out 5 days before my birthday üéÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank you to everyone involved for showing that they can do it right!  There is only 1 Halloween and it is Halloween (1978) Directed by John Carpenter.  This will be Halloween 2 Forty years later.   That would have been like Having Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh make a sequel to Gone With the Wind in 1979.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too many spoilers alreadyüòî
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im Ready For -Halloween-
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like they kind of went with a pretty rough draft of a script.  I'll wait until they do a reboot of it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks cool but not scary like the old ones
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool comedy
ek1ePFp-nBI,The psych ward people scare me more!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gay
ek1ePFp-nBI,IS THAT IANS MOM
ek1ePFp-nBI,god I don't know if I can wait until October
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:52 You won't see a live oak like that in Illinois. That's a landmark of the city it was filmed in: my hometown Charleston.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Does anyone else not think that the story itself doesn't really make a lot of sense? Danny McBride decides to kill off them being siblings, so now we're stuck with Michael, a lunatic who apparently only killed 3 teens on Halloween night 40 years prior and almost kills Laurie, so she wants nothing more than for him to escape so she can kill him after all that time? I don't know if that's just me, but that sounds super stale. It would make sense if they were siblings in this movie but the fact that the one element that (to me) truly brought the series together is now gone makes the movie seem like a waste of a story.
Idk correct me if I'm wrong."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The theme music @ 1:56 is my jam!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,And he's okay getting the door hitting his face 3 fucking times?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like the mask! Very good! Looking forward to it! October 19th, 2018-Michael Myers!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt he toss Jaime lee Curtis off a roof in H2O? How is she still alive when her character died?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I knew he was coming back I been waiting
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Stupid cock sucking modern movies.
Even his mask looks ridiculous and over done. 80s horror magic will never return like Micheal Myers did in 88!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pause at 1:25 that escapee really looks like Steven ogg lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's give a round of an applause to Ed Gein.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Coma mierda! El final  estuvo bueno xD. üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love that Jamie Lee Curtis always stayed true to her roots.  She never distanced herself from the Halloween franchise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,There‚Äôs already a remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,for now on...if your closet door won't close you get the hell out of the house.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaeeeee! another Halloween movie! Yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,They don't make any sense when Jamie Lee Curtis died in Halloween now she lives weird
ek1ePFp-nBI,O ya!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wait, is that Austin Powers mike myers?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music is wonderful
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do you all think the addition of intense gore in the Halloween franchise is a üëçüèº or a üëéüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve prayed every night they would make another great Halloween movie. Feel free to stop by Mike and fuck my neighbors up.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is way over due!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"who is that old lady? A cop, his friend- who is she plz..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:42 doesn't he looks like mark hamil from that angle
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not by Rob Zombie nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So my favourite H20 is not canon? :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nigga in the back sounds like noot noot.00:46
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie has such rangeüòÜüòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,who else looked to see if it was a teaser
ek1ePFp-nBI,Same as H20 but it's H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love the original HALLOWEEN.  I haven't seen too many of the sequels.  I saw most H20, which was ok. This film might be totally ignoring that film.  This looks like it could be good.  John Carpenter is the executive producer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original shape: Nick Castle
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I can‚Äôt wait üíò
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought she died, WTF?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Foggy fresh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Isn't it cool when you type a comment on a video, then you click on the video weeks/mouths later and see that it has like √≥ver 200 likes on it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie made his Halloween movies So ugh !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 it was at this moment she knew.... she fuc#ed upüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie Strode went full Sarah Connor. This better be good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Scariest moments of the trailer for me were:

1. Mental ward courtyard scene (won't show Michael's face when dude shows him the mask).

2. Closet door scene."
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 *NOOT NOOT*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just came to watch ad. And then another ad.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait its going to be sick
ek1ePFp-nBI,the ending made me jump....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt she die in one? Didnt he die in one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"IF MICHAEL TURNS AROUND AND SAYS:
THAT MASK, IT BELONGS TO ME...

I WALK OUT OF THEATRE..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be one scary Halloween!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,In third grade I saw 3 minutes of the 1978 version. I literally couldn't pee alone for a damn month.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she die in the last one ? Lol or some shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,I actually cant wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,The legend is back üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,who's ready to shit their pants?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohh
ek1ePFp-nBI,How Michael come bak when she chopped off his head in H20? Lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally looks like we might have a good or descent remake,because that Rob Zombie Edit was garbage in my opinion."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking can't wait to watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:53 this is why we dont shit in public restrooms
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cripes, is Hollywood even able to imagine new material anymore?!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another fucking movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well this does not look promising.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This goin be lit way better than the old version. Start of a new era LET'S GO 
#NewEra
#NewFranchise"
ek1ePFp-nBI,MY FAVORITE KILLER!!! <3 <3 <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay...I stopped watching half way through because I don't want any spoilers. Hot damn, this is what I've been waiting for. Halloween with John Carpenter involved. Hopefully it will erase the last 30 years of shit that the Halloween franchise has become! So excited!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot freaking wait !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombies watching this and crying right now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love how Laurie says ""Michael"" @2:20 almost like the predator became prey."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"WTF! I JUMPED AT THAT 1 PART lol and it's just a trailer! 
I'm excited for this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another remake? Jeez.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, about how old is he?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too bad Dr loomis won‚Äôt be in here Rest In Peace
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder how they caught him if in the original after getting shot by loomis he got up and escaped
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not go lie in the middle when he flip his knife was bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,like the old ones are better
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow this looks a completely uninspired, money grab, rehash."
ek1ePFp-nBI,H A L U K   B ƒ∞ L G ƒ∞ N E R
ek1ePFp-nBI,A great trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell yeah seems lit can‚Äôt wait üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,THEY BROKE NEW GROUND! (0_0)'
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Pause here 2:09 and look at the windows were Michael is looking and look at the third window to the left, there‚Äôs someone standing there! What?!?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lets hope it turns out like Cult Of Chucky
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead By Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do a jason vs miachel film
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm the boogeyman man I like Halloween bruh
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't ever get tired of the Halloween Movie'süéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm hype for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks like Laurie ‚Äúresurrected‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks soo good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shatner strikes again!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is why you don‚Äôt make white mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, i won't expect my son to see this one with me. He'll never admit it, but he doesn't like scary movies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,NICK CASTLE RETURNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'd rather watch willow
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't remember Michael getting arrested in Halloween 2  not rob zombie version
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please let the trailer live up to the hype I'm feeling inside, (everyone forgive me when I say this but) My favorite Psychopath, and mass murderer is Indeed Michael Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,end it please. lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I think this is the first slasher movie ever starring a ""grandma""... This is so groundbreaking."
ek1ePFp-nBI,didn't micheal kill laurie strode already?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gotta see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie lee Curtis died in the last one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy shit, finally one worth watching"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,God is good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Heres a tid bit for ya, They used a William Shatner's   Star Trek Halloween kids mask to use for the Michael Meyers mask. They painted over Shatner's eyebrows to make it a little creepy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,His mask looks like it was in the dirt for like 10 years and he found it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok it‚Äôs summer time but this just made me so excited for Fall to get here!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Personally I think Michael Myers was best portrayed by Rob Zombie.  He's the biggest and most brutal in the 2007 and 2009 movies but they both sucked.
ek1ePFp-nBI,oooh i just wanna see this movie already
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,TOTAL CRAP!

ek1ePFp-nBI,The night he came home!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, some of these people are supposed to be dead, right?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie A BADASS‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mask was actually easy to make---took Larry King's skin off painted it white
ek1ePFp-nBI,Once again...the cops suck at their jobs.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He better be 6'4 !!!!!! I don't want no Gary Colemen running around thinking he's invincible, lmao."
ek1ePFp-nBI,how many reboots does Halloween need? F&(Ks sake...... The Rob zombie movies were perfectly fine.....can the 21st century be about original movies for once? rather than MORE GD REBOOTS??
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like all the Halloween movies so this shit better be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,wait whatttt serious it out ma fav movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm dying to see this movie on Friday October 19th 2018

ek1ePFp-nBI,"its been 40 years, Michael would be like 60 now"
ek1ePFp-nBI,SA MILAN TRESKAVICA 0 LAJKOVA!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many batmans do we need? How many marvel movies? Stop living in the past!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The beginning was retarded
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet many of the scenes they are showing us here won't actually be in the movie. They usually do that with trailers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This takes place before he killed her right ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, but if she only met the shape the one night then why is so terrified obsessed with him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im almost sure that British guy is dr.lommis's son.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't  Laurie die in the last movie when she got stabbed and thrown off a roof I mean I'm pumped for the movie but ummm om
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Shape as he should be!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pause @ 2:08 and look at the window on the far left.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jurassic World is a theme park in the Halloween universe and is off limits during the yearly Purge.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The mask is scary af. I love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YEAH!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Crazy!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,There better not be some no generation kids saying I didn't know their was an original movie.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Same actors same music........  Same mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who‚Äôs ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, but I thought Laurie Strode killed herself at the beginning of Halloween Resurrection in 2003? Are we just turning a blind eye to that?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This ain‚Äôt scarier than my friends cooking now that should be the next sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like another shitty American thriller.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ctm wea buena
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bro I‚Äôm hyped asf
ek1ePFp-nBI,ya vi el trailer y me cage
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,How is she in this film if they killed her off?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm looking forward to this but it looks like the same old formula, despite the glimmer of hope given at the first part of this trailer. love those visuals in the court yard."
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,I auditioned for this üñïüèΩhope y‚Äôall don‚Äôt sell a single ticket
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nick Castle is actuing Michael Myers in this remake?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't beat the.old classic horror movies this will be good. horror movies today suck.. Name 1 horror released today that will be remembered as a classic?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 Michael's face...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween Flashbacks
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whaaaaaaaaat?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This shit is stupid af look at the plot making white people look stupid af, she let him escape so she could kill him? Then the bus crashed omg ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è this shit sucks."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought the sis died on the other one?? Lol still seeing this thoüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Enough with this genre of horror films. You have beaten these characters to death and still, they keep coming back. It's becoming redundant. Try to find something new and original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:52
ek1ePFp-nBI,Samhain
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm sooooo, ready for this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"who u wanna be ""reboot jason or new michael myers here"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay that scene with the closet at the end is so cheesy, can they not come up with a creative scare anymore?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pieces of this film look to be redone from other movies to bring the entire franchise together. Car repair shop scene-Halloween 4 bathroom scene -Halloween h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,Teen actors seem blah but the rest of the movie looks like a hit
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:45 NOOT NOOT
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's really gonna try to come back after what Jamie Lee Curtis did to him in the first film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:28 Shut up Carol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Don't get me wrong I really want to watch this movie, but I've read that John Carpenter was not pleased with Rob Zombie's remakes because they ""humanized"" the character, but how is this different? I mean Michael was captured somehow and hospitalized, that means that he's not invincible, that he's human, that he's not that much of a supernatural being/force as we might have thought.
I don't know maybe I'm overreacting a bit too much, and probably will like the movie anyway, but hey I wanted to get this out haha :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn im so glad they made another one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow Michael Myers  looks quite good for an old man
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trick or treat mother fucker! xD Hahaha
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like they spoiled a good scare, with the Shape-in-the-closet thing"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael vs Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,*UN POPULAR OPINION INCOMING* i think rob zombies halloween was good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Isnt he like 70 now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aw hell nah Karen!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she chopped his head off in 1998! H20 ... Yawn ... its like a dodgy spoof for Sponge Bob Fans!! ü§§ü§£üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,That lady is a badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The part when that girl opened the closet door in the end there...
I died laughing when Michael was just standing there, I don't know what about it, but it was hilarious!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought they were married
ek1ePFp-nBI,AWESOME....!!!! GREAT VIDEO!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see my childhood boogieman back again!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so confused on the plot... didnt this happen in h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is awesome but I'm sad Rob Zombie isn't making it üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mr carptner has had enough of everyone slaughtering his film he now comes back to shut them all up this is his masterpiece.... He will deliver.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watch Halloween 4!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shut them all up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hey this actually looks like it could be pretty good....eh....I'll watch it on a plane.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am besides myself
ek1ePFp-nBI,"looking at it,it doesnt make cense,michael was already killed, loomis is dead,some pieces are re-made for this movie nothing really new"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers + Jamie Lee Curtis +John Carpenter= Real Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,F is this sh** I'm out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween Origins <3

ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúFangirl screech‚Äù I‚Äôm sooo excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,blhhhheeeerhhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,PAUSE REAL QUICK AT 1:49
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Thought Jamie Lee Curtis Died In Halloween Resurrection In The Beginning
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok wow dreams come true
ek1ePFp-nBI,This. Is. HALLOWEEN.
ek1ePFp-nBI,THERE IS TOO MANY SEQUELS TOO MANY
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:31 That‚Äôs a wrap for you!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,If she old then why does Michael  not look old
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It is back Michael Myers, like this if you love Jason Voorhes, Michael Myers, Chucky, PinHead, GhostFace,Leatherface."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just one question, Michael would be like 60 now? Don't mess with a ticked off old man!  All kidding aside, should be good. The original was a classic!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aw how I have missed that theme tune. Can't wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,First Halloween came out in 1976 he still not dead.
ek1ePFp-nBI,hope its not shitty like h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,Evil has no age
ek1ePFp-nBI,people thought he was dead now tell them all king is back...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Good for you Michael. Gotta finish that job you started. :-)
Joke aside, i hope this turns out well."
ek1ePFp-nBI,soooo we are going to ignore the fact they already killed jamie lee curtis's character off in the early 2000s? Halloween H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael probably wasn‚Äôt going to fuck her up that bad until she slapped him with the door 9 times
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee curtis a libtard....hope she killed ten seconds in...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes yes yes yes yes. The real originators, and producers. Another great thriller Halloween movie so long waited for. Please bring it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It was all good until 2:36. What the hell is this 1978?
ek1ePFp-nBI,All those years waiting it better be worth it
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the greatest killers EVER in Hollywood is back & for my birthday!!!!! Yayyyy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit looks shitty
ek1ePFp-nBI,those poor losers in the uSA just cant come up with something new.. very very sad
ek1ePFp-nBI,So original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,That makes sense now alternate movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,SHIT GOT REAL WHEN THE DOG STARTED GOING BAT SHIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks amazing! Can‚Äôt wait! It‚Äôs crazy how the first one was filmed back in 1978 and 40 years later and a new one is coming out! üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why can't things like this happen in my town üòî
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm a big fan of Michel Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, just realised Haloween and friday the 13th aint the same thing, Sitting here thinking why the fuck Jason keep getting called Michael"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm ready!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ya know, with all of these cinematic universes coming out, a cool idea would be a slasher universe, with Michael Myers, Jason Voohries, Freddy Krueger, Evil Dead, and even Texas Chainsaw Massacre, all happening in the same universe. This can pave the way for crossovers like Freddy vs Jason, Jason vs Michael, and Jason vs Freddy vs Ash Williams!

Probably not possible, but a man can dream..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell ya Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,SPOOKY. SCARY. WOW.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My door was not closing like that . But I did something amazing you know what I did?...
..................

..............
.................... I fixed it HAhaha you smartass"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just like Michael this movie should be dead!!!! So over this
ek1ePFp-nBI,so exciteeeeeeed
ek1ePFp-nBI,In custody? I thought he was killed like 4 times already?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am so excited what Micheal Myers is going to bring, although the Halloween 2  movie released 2009 was pretty bad considering the beginning of that movies taking place in the hospital was pretty cool until she woke up from the dream, Now Micheal Myers is my favorite killer in horror which I have all his movies except one I can't find, and I am praying this one is good, cause even though Micheal Myers had gotten older, I wonder how pwerful he is."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:42 holy fuck written by danny mcbride?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OK people, I need volunteer to close my closet door."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why oh whyyyyyyyyy? And I'm a huge Halloween fan.
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YAY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have my doubts. Love Halloween 1 and 2, but Hollywood tends to screw things up."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It sounded like the jurassic park theme song until they started the whole song
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thats her son. movie over
ek1ePFp-nBI,#NotMyMichael
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you think about it, this is what would‚Äôve happened if Michael never escaped after the 1981 film and didn‚Äôt manage to kill Laurie in Ressurection"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm never trusting the bathroom stall again never like and comment
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ƒ± think this film like perfect, will we see the new masks ?Because these masks AWESOME"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this following the original timeline Or is it related to the Rob Zombie version of Halloween?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hype
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,how original...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessss finally I can't wait to watch this this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 2 and the first one (the original) are both my favorite movies and can‚Äôt wait to see this one on opening night! Hopefully this new one will be better than the previous remakes.  Carpenters scores are so bad ass and that haunting piano theme is so simplistic yet so chilling. The best score ever in my opinion!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought his sister shot him in the face and then the movie ended?
ek1ePFp-nBI,All time FAVORITE. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS!! I use to watch all his movies every day on replay. I love HALLOWEENüñ§üñ§üëø
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When the movie ""Jaws"" first came out in the 1970s, I went to see it with my girlfriend.  After I saw the movie, I couldn't look at a glass of water or sit in my family's backyard swimming pool for two days without hearing that ""Jaws"" music theme."
ek1ePFp-nBI,But Lori died in Resurrection and didn't she only have a son not a daughter?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don‚Äôt suck
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween move is so scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, I remember when Michael Was Hiding from people in the stall and waiting for them... Now He‚Äôs Going IN the stalls"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michella Myers...
Michella Myers...

MICHELLA Myers.....
Michella MYERS.....
MICHELLA MYERS!!!!!
Hes back now!
The B movie killer is back, now.....
And even better...





FINALLY a GOOD killer comes back like,
Jason Voorhes,
Freddy Kruger,
And.....
Michella Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is the perfect boogy man. A halloween marathon is needed now. That turned inside out mask is great makeup
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The first dozen were good, we don‚Äôt need another"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So Michael is back finally i have benn waiting for this moment
PS I hope they do more Halloween movies in the future"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs a William shatner mask.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Original title: *HALLOWEEN H40 : 40 YEARS LATER*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal: *Ms. STRODE I DONT FEEL SO GOOD*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Michael was immortal? Also they should've casted Mike Meyers
ek1ePFp-nBI,i want to see the full film <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,Already looks better than Halloween II from rob zombie (first one was better)
ek1ePFp-nBI,God bless you to know him in Jesus Christ name he's coming back soon be prepared and repent diligently.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dont look to scary but is ight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one...? Urgh...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait it looks like they finally did it right again
ek1ePFp-nBI,i think they should've let RobZombie make the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael fucking Myers returns! This guy made every 90's kid wet themselves on several occasions! 

Jason X is next.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,No sense. Laurie or lorie strode dies in Halloween resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is the boogie man
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna ruin the classic ones

ek1ePFp-nBI,Good trailer now I don't have to watch the movie!

ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 LOL
ek1ePFp-nBI,This comes out on my birthday
ek1ePFp-nBI,That‚Äôs one bad ass grandma
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry am I missing something.... He says ""he spent the last 40 years in captivity"" .... Then who was this.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Id be willing to bet woman with the guns dies horrificly in true horror movie fashion. Cuz guns never work in horror movies becaus that wouldent be interesting
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It‚Äôs nice that they are scrapping all of that curse bullshit that just made the ‚Äúserial killer‚Äù aspect not as good as it was for the first few movies. I‚Äôm probably gonna regret it, but I‚Äôm fucking hyped for this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I must see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,can they stop remaking classic movies omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers has a nice coat ü§îüëçüèª

ek1ePFp-nBI,This might be a signed that he‚Äôll be in mk11
ek1ePFp-nBI,So are they seriously gonna act like the horrible sequels didn't happen???
ek1ePFp-nBI,This sucks
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this makes sense because lori wasn't definitively shown dead off the roof in Halloween resurrection and they can still continue the series but never expected them to make another one, skies the limit .  Sidenote: I like the rob zombie remakes but prefer the original storyline ."
ek1ePFp-nBI,My heart was in my mouth the whole time. Man! I thought o ly possession movies scared me anymore but this movie is gonna be awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's William Shatner like you've never seen him before.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else thought Paul Bettany was in this trailer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,What happened to her son in boarding school lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wasnt Michael Myers stabbed in eye in first Halloween and shot in the eyes in the second? Dudes completely unstoppable
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok this is crazy, another halloween movie? Are you kidding me? No I'm done with these movies. There just too many."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is just misunderstood.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael must be too old to kill people he's like 57 or 60 by now man wtf
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've done a reaction to this, check it out guys ‚ù§üëç"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit looks scary af
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watching this just cuz it's a classic
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love that music when Michael Myers be chasing them
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was micheal not suppose to be supernatural being? It seems he has been humanized in the newer movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The fact that are bringing back Jamie Lee Curtis and the same actor who played Micheal in the original means this should be a good one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,OoOo Bo2 music
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I trust the majority of the comments below me that this looks great.

I don't want to¬†see any scenes.¬† ¬† Can't stand movie trailers!¬†¬† so I depend on you guys.¬† :]"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What bus driver?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So forgetting every Halloween made after the original, this would be 40 yrs after the original, basically some ones take on a part 2, four decades later??"

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is why I don't like closets at night
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I bet, those teeth Michael dropped on the floor are the teeth of her partner. The guy who showed Michael the mask."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who would win?

Michael Myers or Jason ü§î"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yay this means there should be a Friday 13th or nightmare on Elm street soon
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can anyone tell me if 2:03 is Madelaine Petsch?
ek1ePFp-nBI,They finally made a movie about my Ex üôÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've watched all the Halloween movies since I was 6 years old now I'm 15.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm going to see this!!! I was wondering when another one would come out. Super geeked . This movie better kick a$$
ek1ePFp-nBI,I heard one say noot noot

ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit is becoming like batman.... give a rest OMG!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"MICHEAL MYERS IS FUCKING BACK 

(6/12/18)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,holy sh**
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ballsy move, this movie has A LOT to live up to."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"AHHHHH, STAHP! I COULD'VE DROPPED MY CROISSANT!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should have left the brother sister theme then this would make sense...now its jus a random guy that's been  tryin 2 kill her after 40 years stupid stupid not creepy anyone
ek1ePFp-nBI,Has anyone had the feeling after watching a horror movie the second time you don't get scared so the new Halloween movie is going to be so exci
ek1ePFp-nBI,They had two pitched which would be even more badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is thuis real
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm pretty sure Michael lives at the end just googled the movie and up pops how they were making two movies instead of one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, so this ignores all previous sequels a reboots and just jumps from 1978 to 2018?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"By them saying that he is not her brother, messes with all the movies! except 3 of course. LOL! The whole point of Michael wanting to kill Laurie in the first place was because she was his sister? The same with him trying to kill Laurie's daughter, and sadly seceding, was because the only way Michael could find piece from his demons was if all his family was dead. Even if this is suppose to start after the very first Halloween, everyone knew Michael was her brother in that one as well! So great! now we have 3 different story lines for Halloween! and no I am not counting that piece of shit Rob Zombie version screw up either! It was like H20, it was Like Laurie never had a daughter! She would give up her daughter to keep her safe from her ""BROTHER""  but apparently she could give a tinkers damn if Michael, got a hold of her son? OH! OK! and now she has another daughter but no son?  I mean don't get me wrong, I'm glad they finally got off their asses and time after time they have promised a new Halloween! and I am glad they finally stuck to their word! but come on! Stop screwing with the original story line, You all are making me dizzy!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anybody think they showed to much in the trailer? Questions I was gonna have watching the movie they showed in the trailer. Like how would he escape...answered. How would he get his mask back...answered. Pretty much know how the movies gonna go from it just don‚Äôt know the ending.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought this film was gonna be made by rob zombie. Anyone else?
Also I don‚Äôt know if this is a sequel or a pre-sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"@1:34: Oh, man, I ALWAYS DID HATE public restrooms, now I know WHY!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ Can't wait!üòàüòàüòà  C'mon October!!! üéÉüéÉüéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I fucking love Halloween I LOVE MICHLE MYERS #MICHLEMYERSFANLOVERS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look at 2:08 on left window
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie gonna flop
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks interesting!
ek1ePFp-nBI,You mean to tell me this isn‚Äôt click bait??üò≥
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow! I'm stoked!! They keep rebooting the concept and reincarnating it with different storylines, but I like the fact they keep trying to maintain some continuity with Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode! Granted, some elements of the story should not change. Michael Myers is an unstoppable force, I don't like that he is just a ""common prisoner"" in a jail as the storyline ""tries"" to pick up some semblence of pace from the 1978 original. However, after all these years, I feel this new film will be worth watching just to see where the killings take us now. It's been a long time, Michael. Make it good for all of us!! üòâüëå‚úä"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM SOOOOO WATCHING THIS MOVIE
ek1ePFp-nBI,His new mask is sick its like it fits perfectly on his face its almost like it is his face
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seeing as they are ignoring every sequel after the original Halloween it gives me hope for a sequel to Aliens 1986, they should do the same and ignore Alien 3 and Alien resurrection"
ek1ePFp-nBI,that‚Äôs dope
ek1ePFp-nBI,please help me sub this channel thanks
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAY THE HALLOWEEN REMAKE IT'S GOING 2 BE SCARWY
ek1ePFp-nBI,im never gonna go trick or treating agin
ek1ePFp-nBI,dead by daylight fans cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow i love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,CADE OS *BR*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can you imagine how Michael felt when she kept closing the door on him?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have to see this movie üçøüò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtf? How many times are they gonna do this? Where in the chronology does this take place? Smh.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What about the cult of the thorn
ek1ePFp-nBI,My closet is dirty af how will Michael stay in? And surprise the victim??? Or how will he stand?? So many questions!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was a bit skeptical but after watching the trailer 328 times I think it might be good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,AWWWWWWW YAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!! üòàüëªüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,which one is Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is beutimas
ek1ePFp-nBI,haha it's Dean Munsch
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 That music... Aaaaaah. So awesome! This better be good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Love the first two films then got really weird

Then I loved how they brought it back and showed the story of how it all started and how he was in the mental hospital

It pretty much destroyed what could have been a great storyline to continue

This looks like a remix of some of the older films

Passing stool has been used several times in the franchise

As well as the mental hospital

But I suppose a new generation wouldn't know any of the back stories so it'd be a good one off story"
ek1ePFp-nBI,myers peek-a-boo 699
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Good grief i can't wait for this. Everything since 2 has been mediocre, replacing H2 with this as new line of the story is pretty exciting. Release date uk?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My balls ich  ‚úã
ek1ePFp-nBI,I still screamed even though I knew he was behind that closet door!! üò©üò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,The closet scene is literally my worst nightmare üò•
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish they would hurry up and bang already
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is gonna be the IT of 2018, gonna make a lot of money , happy big mike is back"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anybody care about the tow truck driver?
ek1ePFp-nBI,at 2:08 I remember this from the original movie. LOL and she thinks she just killed M. Myers. HAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can you just make something original and not another moneymaker sequel ???
ek1ePFp-nBI,it sound cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best music ever.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers never dies wtf
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*Dog sees mask starts barking/ inmates freak out

ek1ePFp-nBI,Nothing can fk with the Rob zombie remake's
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE END SCARED ME
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how the mask he is wearing is reminiscent of the original! =)
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am looking forward to seeing the new halloween film and feature sequals.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait I thought michale one thing was not to kill kids
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank Christ John Carpenter did this one and not Rob Zombie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Pause very fast at 1:49.

I think it's the doctor guy that's being killed by michael!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again??
ek1ePFp-nBI,How does he still remenber her from the first one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope they dont make Michael Myers an imposter in this one like they did with Jason in Friday The 13th Part V. I say this because when he attacks the girl in the bathroom stall if you pause around 1:49 you can kind of get a glimpse of the doctors face (The one who held the mask up to Michael Myers on the checker looking floor). If you noticed Michael Myers  (without the mask, has a buzzcut) when you see him banging his head on the bathroom stall door you see a full set of hair, if you pause around 1:49 Just right you can see that the person is the doctor. So I hope its the Real Michael Myers doing the killing and not some imposter. I'm worried about them doing this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Go to 0:06 to skip the stupid teaser for the trailer thing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This mf just won't die, lol.. üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,so hyped can't wait love Halloween franchise
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like disappointment
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers is a cis, white male? This movie is incredibly racist, against LGBTTQQIAAP+ rights and is clearly a ploy to keep women in our society down! Why isn't Michael Myers a black, overweight, lesbian lady??? DISGUSTING!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so hyped!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers has hands down the best theme song any slasher can get 
I also can‚Äôt wait to see this, hopefully it can kickstart a bunch of other slashers to follow in its foot steps"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so glad that this Halloween is being refreshed and has a new look and story I can‚Äôt wait for this and this looks like a reboot/new design of a movie that looks great
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Every night to me its Halloween ü¶á
ek1ePFp-nBI,God I'm old üò™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell Nah.  Why da Fuck y'all let his big goofy ass out the crazy Houseü§∑.  Y'all done Fucked up now ü§¶ü§£
ek1ePFp-nBI,The anticipation üòÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome!!! They have my $$$
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the few movies that have triggered some chills in me :s
ek1ePFp-nBI,M&M = micheal myers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,hahahaha...funny movie....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not another fucking Halloween movie, how many times are they going to remake this shit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn they been trying to kill Michael Myers for how many years now!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,JAMIE LEE CURTIS! <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,If the babysitter bang the closet door on my nose that many times Ill be in deep pain...
ek1ePFp-nBI,The acting in this trailer doesn't look very convincing. Also I don't like the camera work (looks like a television series rather than a horror movie).
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love micheal Myersl
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a classic horror movie thats worth goin to the theatres for fuck the modern day horror movies they cant compete with carpenter
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pretty interesting
ek1ePFp-nBI,The success of this movie will depend largely on whether it gets A PG 13 rating or an R rating Because if they downsize it to PG13 it's not going to be worth watchingBecause all of the terrifying miments will be dumbed down for kids they need to stick with a solid R rating
ek1ePFp-nBI,When is it released?    :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:18 Where be the recoil at.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how the scene with the more crazy people like him standing and going crazy when the mask comes out this movie is going to be interesting!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"First, Rob Zombie should‚Äôve been apart of this Again!!
Second, stop making Halloween movies.... I feel like we‚Äôve been through this millions of times and I absolutely love the Halloween movies but let‚Äôs effin move on...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Idk.. When you start wanting to fight the monster it looses a lot of the horror aspect
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wowwwwww
ek1ePFp-nBI,So what he is like 72+ years old now right??
ek1ePFp-nBI,season of the witch was best

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Didn't Lauri die? Either way, I'm watching it!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to watch this in the movies!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another classic horror movie that‚Äôs going to be ruined... but lets‚Äôs give it a chance!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another Remake = Another Dump. Don't even bother.. Looks ridiculous.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guess who‚Äôs getting no sleep after watching this trailer... me!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Micheal  and Jason I love those  killers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just came to hear the theme song
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so scared. I'm pooing my pants üòÖüòÖüòÖ no i am super excited lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,So we‚Äôre going to forget the fact that he killed his sister already in the prequel?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dunno what's more surprising...

Another Halloween movie or that Laurie Strode can also seemingly come back from the dead...

Must be a family trait."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Go michael myers go :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚Ä¢Horror movie cliches
 - Monster/Bad Guy laughs like demon
 - Old lady that knows everything 
 - Being swept on the floor by the monster
 - The suspense violin
 - Edited in Zoom ins
 - Slowly walking in and seeing a dead body, but stupidly continues to press forward 
 - Monster having psychological issues or giving the characters psychological issues
 - The researcher if the movie is lucky enough to not have the old lady or just does
 - The fucking idiot chick that says ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù while the monster is near
- the whole movie if it has 5 or more of these cliches 
- The fans




Edit: Every time you see these in the trailer take a shot of any alcoholic beverage of your choosing"
ek1ePFp-nBI,i always liked the one with busta rhymes.  if u watched it on dvd u could watch almost the entire movie from each of the characters body cams.  always thought that was really cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,This already looks better then the Rob zombie remake. Thank God. Those were just not good. This looks great! Can't wait to see this one!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is going to be crazy! üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, the trailer appears to pay great homage to the original. The Haddonfield setting looks similar; Michael's style of movement is similar. The scene at the gas station/garage strangely reminds me of Michael‚Äôs escape in H4. Mask looks nice. Good to see Laurie Strode looking her age - kind of haggard as well. The scene at the asylum with the chess flooring does not sit well with me...yet. Nor that he simply was locked up for 40 years. If there's no family relation, it changes the entire dynamic of the series. Also, it opens up another continuity in the series:

H1, 2, 4,5,6
H1,2,7,8
H3
The Remake + sequel
H1 (original), 2 (this one)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait see this. Like everyone said ''Y won't he die''?! He is immortal Like fucking Hidan?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So the sequel to Halloween is called...Halloween?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Iva from battlerite poggers
ek1ePFp-nBI,How even Michael Myers mask got wrinkles - somebody help this man out with a walker!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Huh, this looks better than expected"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I sware I'm not one of the please stop making remake guys, but I feel like there has been a lot of attempts at this and if Rob Zombie couldn't make it than I worry here. It looks...ehhh ok I guess. Love the original music and for some reason I think I saw that Danny McBride is a producer on this for some reason a while back. I'll prolly give it a try. I mean obviously I hope its good let me make that clear. 
I know this is gonna sound fd up and some ppl may take it the wrong way, but only because they are keeping up appearances and feel like they gotta teach me a moral lesson with a comment lol but anyway how cool would it be if America like had a really cool serial killer that looked like Mike..I do t give a shit bout the numbers they rack up but I mean like a scary ass dude like this that was just bat shit crazy and wore a creepy mask. Just to make this politically correct I of course would only want him to kill like rapists and drug dealers and sh*t..well ..aybe not drug dealers cause that could make stuff inconvienant but you know what I mean. So in closing I only want the crazy strong scary mask killer to kill very bad ppl ok..ppl that have it coming. I can't believe it's came to having to write this last part in a comment but you know someone actually many are gonna burn me at the stake for it amyway. I'm just saying I know there are so many ppl that just  watched that trailer and if they read this they will say..ya that would be kinda cool I guess."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I heard Michael is pansexual and identifies as tans black .. I'm just kidding. . I fucking hope I'm just kidding
ek1ePFp-nBI,Time to play dead by daylight while I wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next time you take a shit in public and somebody bangs on your door just keep your mouth shutüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally they get battle each other!! Bro vs Sis..üòÑ

ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope we get to see the actor that played Tommy in halloween 6 as an adult tommy again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:27 sounds like Piper in Fallout 4.
ek1ePFp-nBI,üò±üò±üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS LOOKS LIKE INSIDIOUS ThE LAST KEY
ek1ePFp-nBI,who doesn't want to see this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,When does this movie comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:32 I heard the dog saying :Hello how are you doing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeeeeeeeeeees!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why though?  And Jamie Lee Curtis just signs onto these sequels like ""fugg it.  it's a paycheck."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Retardulous
ek1ePFp-nBI,If it‚Äôs not as fucked up and sadistic as rob zombies then what‚Äôs the point? He set the bar
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel sorry for the tow truck driver he killed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssssssss!! I cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny McBride co wrote this...so I'm down to watch
ek1ePFp-nBI,Leave it to Rob Zombie.

ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years locked up? Wouldn't that make him nearly 70 years old? Just take away his bus pass. Lmao.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56. This movie is definitely gonna rock
ek1ePFp-nBI,... that fucking begining is brilliant idea
ek1ePFp-nBI,So now trailers are gonna start having mini trailers of the trailer at the beginning of the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are they serious? This brother and sister movie is getting way old. Crazy brother with white mask kills people and tries to kill his sister on Halloween and in the end he doesn't . That's the whole movie again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes finally he‚Äôs back!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love this movie :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"-You haven't seen halloween? 
-No. 
-You should."
ek1ePFp-nBI,FinallyüòÜüòÜ i have been waiting for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"God, some body stop this halloween movies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,shrek 5
ek1ePFp-nBI,...If you didn't get goosebumps when the theme music came on at 1:56 then you just don't understand and probably shouldn't bother seeing this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is gonna be great! I can't wait, better be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I literally screamed out
ek1ePFp-nBI,my only issue with this is that they are ignoring halloween 2. i'm sure i will like this new film but halloween 2 will always count for me. i even like 4 and 5.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"awesome 
get 60subscriber within 1hour 100% sure click:#rbtipsandtracks"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seems like they could do better.
ek1ePFp-nBI,80's movies will always live on and remain the best
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see bloopers before the movie even comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie is a frickin beast

ek1ePFp-nBI,WOW did not expect that!! This movie looks like it could be the best horror film of the year!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i'm confused, wasnt there a halloween movie made a few years ago? are they already remaking it or is this a sequel?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks interesting. Not crazy about the new nightmare on elm street. But want a new friday the 13th bad. Never forget how he snapped that guy body in 2 pieces.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If people just ran in horror movies, the killers don‚Äôt know how to run because it wouldn‚Äôt be as scary, I know this is a funny vine and meme already and people don‚Äôt run in horror movies because it would be too easy for the people to get away I just though it was funny"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers for the first time since the first 2 movies is that evil in the shadows, stalking, waiting, emotionless, and not a hulking, growling, angry giant the other movies made him, and now I‚Äôm reading that there‚Äôs another one in the works if this succeeds?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It seems that with the ""just rumours"" line, they're implying that all the movies after the original ""Halloween"" are actually just the urban myths and ghost stories told in the years since -- which naturally (as those things tend to do) got out of control in making the killer invincible and immortal and all that.

It's kind of a clever way to retcon without having to totally disown all the sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another spoiler filled trailer. That last bit in the bedroom = ruined.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"""no one cared who I was until I put on the mask"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like Michael was expecting them to open the closet door to look for something and he thought it would be bad ass to jump them but instead gets hit three times to the face with the door lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,In profile he looks like HORATIO KANE :-D

ek1ePFp-nBI,When he was blocking the closet I fucking laughed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hmmm...so it seems this movie is thrown in a timeline that is original parts 1 and 2, then H2O, then this.
Parts 3-5, and the Rob remakes are not canon as its non-Jamie versions."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CANT WAIT üôÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I personally don't think carpenter can compete with zombie but I'm interested to see how this comes out (yes I'm aware carpenter came up with the franchise I just think rob zombie captures the essence of Michael Myers so much better)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks sick

ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this one. Especially with John Carpenter directing it. Now I know that this will probably be a good Halloween movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks promising

ek1ePFp-nBI,HALLOWEEN is my favorite movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy crap, yes! Halloween is my favourite scary movie and this actually looks like a good remake!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Horror movies aren't so scary anymore.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The most retarded thing about Michael Myers is that he's been shot in both eyes and can see just fine...that is beyond unforgivable.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hell yeah I am excited to see Jamie back in the game for once and for all. 

I hope she survives in the end."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is awesome!!! I cannot wait to go see this movie. This will be the most anticipated movie of the year for me. I have the blue ray collection and am hoping to add this one to have the complete set. Michael Myers is my childhood lol sounds kinda weird but I started watching these movies since I was around 7 or 8 years old. I always binge the series during Halloween season. It's a must for my fam and me!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i expected the skull trooper in this movie I‚Äôm very disappointed
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I feel as though Michael should stay un killable. Or at least a geinus, (like the joker, in a way) and that would be the reason he was .
""un killable"" (yes I feel that description makes no sense.)
I just want him to be the ""boogy man"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Granny Curtis scares me in this one, Micheal is more of a laughing matter because of the teeth."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheals back ! I‚Äôm so hyped !!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is a person and a all most Un-killable monster.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As someone who hasn't followed this story line all that closely, I have two questions: I thought he WAS her brother? And didn't she cut his f-----g head off at the end of H20?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Meh, purge is better."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"sighs, im not watching this garbage"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How in the blue hell did his sister survive last time, Jamie Lee Curtis's character should already be dead"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"friday the 13th, halloween, used to make me so scared when i was young but now it makes me laugh whenever i watch it cuz its so darn stupid. lol. i think jason vs. freddy was better. hope this movie is good. we need more good scary movies for the summer."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween forever!
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter IS The King! Halloween Was And Is The Greatest Horror Movie Of All Time! Period.  I'm Excited About This One. Sorry ROB Zombie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sucks, there prolly gonna fill this movie with cheap jump scares and horrible ill-timed puns. A shame too. The 1st Halloween gave me nightmares as a kid. Horror movies are just all the same now. Trash!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,And why remakes? this doesn't need to exist smh you have good remakes and this won't be one of them
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks good I want to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHY would they reveal Michael being behind that door in the TRAILER? You know how scary it would be if it came out of nowhere with no build up? Like she's just tucking the kid into bed and he's scared of his closet like most kids are and she's just closing it. It would seem like they were just developing the relationships between characters and then BAM
ek1ePFp-nBI,BE CARFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR. üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this is good
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 oh yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoop-de-doo! Another retcon sequel remake to a remake of a remake's remake! Hollywood is so original these days.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks really interesting,it better not have a shit ending lol just saying"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seeing that distorted pumpkin...just brings it all back!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well I shouldn‚Äôt have watched dis before I went to bed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Loved these movies since the beginning!! CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just gonna watch this movie because Dead By Daylight Game......
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Wick is the one you call to kill the Boogeyman. They should have call Mr. Wick

ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween. The night HE came home.
ek1ePFp-nBI,soooo.. what's next? friday the 13th reboot and nightmare on elm street?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"AW MAN, I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE, SHE SHOULD FINALLY FINISH HIM OFF IN THIS ONE. BUT I THINK THE ENDING SCENE IN H20 SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE FINISHER, IT WAS JUST TOO BAD A**!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait to see it!!!! Michael Myers returns!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombies movies are Garbage!!! Why not ask John carpenter üò°üò°üôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Right when this movie starts, I'm gonna leave the cinema with my pants WET"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'll be watching it on my note 9
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When the Music hits . Love it
Just hoping they don‚Äôt make him talk or make those weird ass noises he made when killing someone on rob zombies remake"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I STILL SAY SHE WAS FINE AF IN ""TRUE LIES"" BUT OVERALL CANT WAIT TO SEE THE PREMIERE..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,No one cared who I was until I put on the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why you should never use the gas station restroom!!
Reason #1: Unsanitary environmnet
Reason #2: Always out of tp
Reason #3: 1:32"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie did a much better version of Halloween.. Hands down.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!üíØüëèüëèüëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As a fan from childhood and growing up with the original movies, I can honestly that while I‚Äôm glad Carpenter has returned I wish they‚Äôd just give it a rest for a bit. The Rob Zombie run of films were an embarrassment to the franchise and I feel like they needed more time to forget about those films. Obviously Jamie Lee Curtis isn‚Äôt getting any younger but I just hope this is a solid movie and they let it die for at least 15 years before trying to touch these movies again."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should have name it either Michael or Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Huge fan but I'm not sold on this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,She has a daughter?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be a awesome year
ek1ePFp-nBI,Brosss this movie is gonna be lit!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt he get his head chopped off with an axe in Halloween H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love HALLüéÉWEEN SAGA 1978-2018.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't get why she thinks she can kill him... The doctor shot him 6, times 40 years ago and he lived. What's a shotgun gonns do?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maikol mayiers buajajajajjajaa
ek1ePFp-nBI,meeh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Her Final Confrontation? So Strode didn't die in H20 hmm? What's the new timeline of this and how many sequels is Universal and Blumhouse going to milk?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Spoiler alert, she is going to kill Michael at the end"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,October 19??? Dawm that's a cool min lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey




That's pretty good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,IF YOU DO THE MOVIE JUST MAKE SURE IT FEELS AS REAL AS POSSIBLE WATCHING IT. NOT NO CHEESY COMEDY SCARY MOVIE. Please don‚Äôt mess it up and scare the shit out of EVERYONE
ek1ePFp-nBI,It has a 40% chance of being shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's new weakness - *Doors*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"if you look closely the crime scene pictures of the first knife the note above reads to me ""Laurie Strode Upstairs bedroom"" so that's the knife she stabbed him in the chest with and the second knife is the one he stabbed Bob in the chest with"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"People think this is a sequel to 1981's Halloween II, in fact: THIS IS Halloween II, the first movie happened, the rest doesn't exist, get your facts straight, people."
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE DAMN MUSIC STILL GETS ME.
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOST new sequel with Matthew Fox! https://youtu.be/aKzuzahlFBs

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, a sequel to Halloween that doesn't look like utter dogshit. And thank god they retconned all those godawful sequels with this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm sooo ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking Blumhouse Make the Halloween franchise into an anthology like Carpenter wanted leave Michael be he is sacrosanct it's more creative freedom and will ensure succes

ek1ePFp-nBI,nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,Isn't he dead already
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers has survived fires, gun wounds, even decapitation. Yet amazingly this man manages to stay whole. Really instead of trying to kill this guy they should be cloning him....alright that might not be the best idea."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs 10:53pm 1 like= 1 pray for 10:53pm watchers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should of left it to rob zombie this shot looks like fucking garbage

ek1ePFp-nBI,Gore is never horror
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm extremely excited about this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeeeessssssiiiiiirrrrrrr hopefully this is the movie to end it all tho.
ek1ePFp-nBI,@1:48... it is the detective trying to break down the door... not Michael! I wonder if he tried on the mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Shyt mite b good,  but will it be better than the rob zombie version"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I could imagine when Michael was in the bathroom he was going to be like hey do you have my mask by any chance been looking for it everywhere
ek1ePFp-nBI,So... Which one is this following the reboot or orignal?
ek1ePFp-nBI,aaaahhhhh laurie is back !!

ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter. All hail the king.
ek1ePFp-nBI,yesssss excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will this come in the cinemas? Someone please tell me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal is a weaker version of Jason but he is unstoppable in his own way. Got run over by cars and pistol shot few times still survive.

ek1ePFp-nBI,1 more stupid movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nothing can't beat the original, but I still think that Halloween 2 and 4 were pretty decent."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:10 thanks to my little brother I realized it‚Äôs a mirror not a door.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm never closing my closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,"when the camera shows the scene of him standing in the window of the house, look 2 windows to the left... theres someone with what looks like to be a hood standing there."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"just remembering ""True Lies"".....good f***ing god she was so hot"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm pleased to say, I am Very excited for the release of this Brilliant Film!."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Same ol story
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just hope it‚Äôs not like the previous movies; the victim runs, he only walks and anyway he murders the victim."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That could be good, WE WILL FUCKING SEE WON'T WE"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Funny
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look at those guns being put to good use to protect people
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 great acting..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fuck hes back
ek1ePFp-nBI,For some reason i want him to kill curtis this time. In the most horrible way.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looking forward to this film also why did they let some journalist in asylum especially let journalist show Michael his mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If you listen closely you can hear Elmo at 0:46
ek1ePFp-nBI,My husband is BACK TO KILL ALL YOU  HOES ONCE AGAIN üëåüèΩ
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:08 When I see my crush in public

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers >> Jason Vorhees
ek1ePFp-nBI,My boy Torstein!! You're alive!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm sorry this looks even worse than slender man
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This actually looks like a decent Halloween sequel. This is coming from a true horror loving nut. (Probably understood from the profile pic). At least it‚Äôs ignoring all of the sequels, bringing back Laurie Strode. And we haven‚Äôt had a decent sequel since H20."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I didn't know that grandmoms played fortnite
ek1ePFp-nBI,I definitely gonna see this movie for real no jokes a side  it's gonna be good most definitely thank u
ek1ePFp-nBI,This literally gave me a chub
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nope,nope,nope"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It was confirmed there might be a sequel to this film. Blumhouse said no but mcbride said the future will tell
ek1ePFp-nBI,Me encanta cuando era peque la puta d su hermana no lo llevo a dulce o travesura asi q bien hecho maiki
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck im late to comment here but damn this is gone be EPIC AS HELLLLL !
ek1ePFp-nBI,If that woman wanted to kill him she should have had an full auto m60
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanna see it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dear Hollywood make something original, The Halloween series has been done to death and how many times does a Michael have to die with no explanation  to why he comes back to life plus who cares about grandma Jamie Lee Curis vs Grandpa Michael Myers that's just retarded  and shows Hollywood can easily people with just the name of a popular  movie that came out 40 yrs ago time for something brand new Hollywood"
ek1ePFp-nBI,who else is so pumped even tho they don‚Äôt like Halloween ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween game tho?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sounds cool n all but let‚Äôs be real Michelle old af he gunna get shot n die 5 minutes in
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How about those ""Silver Shamrock"" masks from Halloween 3 : Season of the Witch that those kids are wearing at 2:07 ? üñíüòÄ That's pretty cool."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"6,000 people give this a thumbs down really??  I love it, can't wait!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Who thinks this movie will be good or bad give me a thüëç which is good or give me  üëéwhich is bad.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween || coming out November 1st..
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish John carpenter would bring the thing back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Also new Friday the13th  movie




(coming soon)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So when Mikel was in the closet she was slamming the door in his face?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Y-Y-YESSS!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't think I'll watch it. The original was campy enough that I could laugh.
This looks scaaaaaary!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëåüëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now we‚Äôre waiting for a Friday the 13th movie agree or disagree?
ek1ePFp-nBI,How old would Michael be in this movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,every scary movie now and days are different and not really scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,Um....   not sure what to think of it. I want to see it cuz of that. I hope it‚Äôs good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Russia , pls .
I‚Äôm fan Halloween"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This girl is crazy let's hope that it's a good one mate üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should make a Michael vs Jason movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Son of a fucking bitch!!!!! Leave it alone!!!!! Best horror movie ever made!! Every sequel after that FUCKING SUCKED!!.  I was glad to see that Rob wasn't involved with this. He's always been half ass no matter what he does. But, I was fucking appalled to see John Carpenter's name listed on the trailer. Fuck! Listen, you're poking a corpse with a stick.
Its not going to come back to life!  You're just going to disfigure something that was once beautiful even more! Movie makers capture our hearts and minds with an original, then they completely strip us of those memories by dulling them down with part 2, part 3, and part 4.
STOP!!!!
Here's a good one. Lets ask Steven Spielberg to remake JAWS.
It would turn the entire film industry into fucking chaos.
Let it go. But, it looks like its too late. Carpenter, I have loved your films for 40 years. Please look elsewhere for new ideas."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They used a fortnite bolt action sniper sound effect üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another One
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is a sequel to the original that totally and completely disavows all of the demented ""supernatural"" crap that almost all other sequels have been about.  This takes it back, much like Rob Zombie's remakes did, to what Michael Myers always was: a homicidal psychopath with a fixation on a holiday.  It looks good, and really is what is needed."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not the kids Michael gotdamn not the kids ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,All these amazing trailers BUT WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR 28 MONTHS LATER!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Likethis comment if ur   gonna watch this movie when it releases
ek1ePFp-nBI,Absolutely incredible!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This has a huge plot hole! If you say this takes place after Halloween 1. After Michael was shot and hit the lawn, doc looks out and Michael is GONE!! According to this trailer, he was taken into custody that night. How, where? Need to reshoot some script and have it follow part 2"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be AWESOME
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo I love nightmare before Christmas
ek1ePFp-nBI,I WANNA SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm so freaking excited to see this!! I‚Äôve been waiting for this trailer forever!! All I can say is INCREDIBLE!!! This is going to be the best sequel ever!! Thank you John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Malek Akkad!! It‚Äôs too bad Donald isn‚Äôt still alive. The only one that could have made this more perfect!! Still going to be a thrill ride!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good looking graphics  i hope my GTX 660  can run this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm SSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOO glad this comes out near my birthday *Sarcasm*
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original scream queen. I hope they pay homage to the coat hanger in the eye scene.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Shape is back!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see it. I wish every month was October so every month we'd have a Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How to be prepared if this happens on Halloween

1. get a bag

2. get a gun

3. put the gun in the bag

4. if you see Michael Myers, shoot him

5. please don't really do it lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,that shotgun probably only did 9 damage
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween? Now THERE'S something that hasn't been done before. . .
ek1ePFp-nBI,its time to start shitting bricks again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Be honest that last jumpscare was so predictable, that you somehow got a bit scared, JUST A BIT."
ek1ePFp-nBI,i will be so pissed if this is garbage
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I want to see this movie, but I don't want to be seen in the theater by myself lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandma finna one pump the shit out of Myers headass
ek1ePFp-nBI,YYYYAAAAYYYY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Hello Michael. I have something you might like to see.""

*shows mask 

""The hell would you do that for?"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait to see this one it looks good and better!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,too bad i won't be alive in october to watch this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a Michael Myers fan I hope this  movie is good I been waiting for years for a Halloween movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jaime looks even better
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they don't mess it up with too much special effects and CGI like they did the IT remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He was taken in to custody after the first movie, Really üòÇüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was this a trailer or a plot summary?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I kinda liked the rob zombie remakes. It offered an explanation of why he lost his mind unlike the originals. This one I'm on the fence about. Trailer just doesn't do it. But I know I'm still going to go see itüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dang it reached 10 million views
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years later!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh- my- God- 
I'm crying.
I-M C-R-Y-I-N-G.
I'M SO HAPPY.
That new mask and badass Laurie with a shotgun. Aaah. I want hug them. 
(By the way I have a BIG CRUSH on Mikey, sooo)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,new mask is sick
ek1ePFp-nBI,So happy
ek1ePFp-nBI,The real question? Will Jamie Lee stay regular during her ordeal?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is a Friday the 13th movie coming soon on 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Probably not as scary with him stalking pushing a walker
ek1ePFp-nBI,I HAVE LITERALLY HAVE WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT IM SO EXITED!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Always want to see Michael as a human killer than a resurrecting monster, definitely looking forward to this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a remake it better not be oh wait good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish It would have picked up from Resurrection üòÇ biggest cliffhanger ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,I havent seen a movie that has actually scared me in years. I know it sounds weird but i hope this one gives me a good scare
ek1ePFp-nBI,Horror ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like complete shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shooting him 6 times should be enough!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, another one?! =)  JLC looks so badass in this one!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:09 thought it said ‚Äúsmoke purp‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny McBride looks like he is doing Halloween justice!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be a long 4 months waiting... IM EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not trusting bathrooms with stalls ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,He scared me when he was in the closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,Showing him the mask.  What a GREAT idea.  Nothing could possibly go wrong...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Badass grandma
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAEL!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This nigga was my childhood nightmare now ima be scared.welp I guess I ain‚Äôt going to the bathroom alone anymore.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason would bitch slap Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael looks less buff than he was when rob zombie made the other Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Favorite killer of all time, if you ruin this movie I swear I‚Äôll hunt all the people involved and turn this into a reality."
ek1ePFp-nBI,the bad of the movie is that it will not be gore
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you pause the trailer at 2:18, that shot and the lighting used reminds me exactly of when The Shape was in the hallway behind Jamie Lee Curtis and startles her and the kids in the original movie. Very good attention to detail.

(EDIT: The color of her granddaughter's shirt is another throwback to Jamie Lee Curtis in the original.)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I pray this movie gets at least more than 80% on rotten tomatoes
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,This should be a fantastic Halloween üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bathroom scene plays grabs girl girl looks at him michel says hey its your coysin want to go bowling gta 4 joke
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now kids,this is why you shouldn‚Äôt celebrate Halloween..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandma got the double pump
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Cant believe its been 40 years wow I was 2 years in 78
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""I spent 8 yrs trying to reach him & then another 7 trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boys eyes was purely& simply (inhales).......Evil"".       R.I.P.  DONALD PLEASANCE. AKA Dr. Loomis"
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:48 I hear that violin sound everywhere and it is annoying.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm excited.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm so mad that this is a sequel after 1978 but it should have been a sequel after 1981
It still looks good though can't wait"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ughh the mask is so scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,i can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this fucking guy is the terminator, fucking die already."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween gang üî™üî™üî™üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've never been a fan of the Halloween franchise, and I think the original is overrated, but this actually looks pretty good.   They have a real director and it shows."
ek1ePFp-nBI,meh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yas Queen.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""tHiS bEtTeR bE gOoD""

Stfu and don't watch the movie then if it doesn't meet your fanboy fiction üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:18 when your grandma finds out you haven't so she shoots food at you.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Urgh great JLC goes all Ellen Ripley üôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now the other classics horror characters need a movie too.
I'm talking about ya boi, Jason."
ek1ePFp-nBI,yesyesyesyesyes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude the new design of Michael Myers wow . So creepy .
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Me: tries to close door
Michael: wtf bro"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:56 Jesus Christ, this gave me goosebumps."
ek1ePFp-nBI,watched this trailer bout 3 times hope this lives to the hype its build
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOOKS GOOD!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought Zombie's take on Halloween was fine... for his first one. His first one he tried to stay true to the aesthetic of the original whereas his second movie he made it ""his own"". The latter was an ""interesting"" twist, but be that as it may I don't think this trailer and movie looks to be any better or worse than what Zombie did. I DO love Strode's independent self-reliant kick-butt attitude here too!

Couldn't help, but freeze frame on the open closet. No clothes hangers. ESPECIALLY metal ones."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is such a badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OK..  ...THEY GOT SOME DAM EXPLAINING TO DO BECAUSE HE KILLED HER IN HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION!!!!! WE SAW HIM STAB HER AND SHE SAID"" SHE WOULD SEE HIM IN HELL!!!"" SO THIS BETTER MAKE SENSE!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In the last 12 months 3 of my favourite films will have  potentially amazing sequels. 
Blade Runner 
Predator 
Halloween. 
Blade Runner 2049 delivered so far. I'm confident in Shane Black bringing back the Predator franchise. This Halloween sequel looks amazing. Having Carpenter and Curtis attached to the project seems like a Labour of love."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully that closet scene is just some much needed comic relief and not just poor writing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can't kill Micheal Myers!!!! You've been trying for 40 years!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How‚Äôs my nigga still catching body‚Äôs
ek1ePFp-nBI,And this is the reason why we need guns!! Shit it looks fucking bad ass!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Myers vs Jason? Vote below. #TeamHalloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is going to be so cool

With Michael Myers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*AHHHHH JAMIEEEEEE AHEVEGEVEGVEBSHE RAAAA*

ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is he still at it?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason and micheal Myers crossover is to good to be true
ek1ePFp-nBI,That theme music gives me chillsüò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awsome but am I the only one who thought the mask looked like cgi when he first puts it on??
ek1ePFp-nBI,@ 0:44 is so disturbing i love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,This scared T.F out of me am never watching it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt she die in Halloween resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I could of been in this movie but I missed my call :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,How Many Halloween Movies Can There POSSIBLY Be?!?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so not feeling this from the moment they show Michel the mask.......why show a killer his mask ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope he be in mortal kombat 11 as a dlc
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES! I can't wait... love Halloween. Michael is one crazy S.O.B.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 surprise motherfucker
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Despite the fact that they're ignoring the past sequels and denying that Michael Myers is Laurie Strode's brother, it's something that I simply cannot unlearn. They'll always be related in my mind. Why would Laurie spend 40 years praying that Michael would break out of prison? Why would Michael instantly come after Laurie the moment he does break out of prison? Coincidence? I don't think so!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why did her shotgun do 9 damage?
ek1ePFp-nBI,10m views wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMFG AHHH!! DUDE THIS AMAZING U KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THERE GONNA MAKE OUT OF THESE SO THAT MEAN THIS MOVIE IS GONNA DOPE ASF BOYS!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,How is Jamie Lee curtis' character still alive?  I thought Michael killed her in resurrection.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The ending just catch u off guard
ek1ePFp-nBI,i hope this one is better than the last one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,1üçÖüçÖ%
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASSss!!üò±üíÄüôåüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,micheal bouta get double pumped by grandma
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let's see....In the original Michael makes his first kill as a child of  around 7 (in 1963) which would make him 22 in '78. That would make him 62 in this movie. The argument is that he would now be an old man and not have the strength to achieve what he did before. If he was totally psychotic and driven to keep in shape, he could still be quite formidable. After all, Dr. Lomis said he  was ""pure evil"" .......and ...........evil.....................never .......................dies.

Happy Halloween........................Oh!  High Mike.  See you found my lost butcher knife."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I will watch this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm sorry but that last part in the closet has got to be the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen, it is so anticlimactic it‚Äôs hilarious"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üñ§
ek1ePFp-nBI,Everyone gonna be dressed like this in Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that a blue pump I see?üòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im sorry but this looks like trash.
ek1ePFp-nBI,#halloween24 #halloweeninfinite #dingdingding ding dingding dingding ding dingding
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just a bumptious woman who thinks she can triumph over Michael because of a traumatic experience. Too bad something as simple as a mindset change doesn‚Äôt bestow victory (especially against Michael).

‚ÄúI think I can, I think I can, I think I can.‚Äù
Turns out you still can‚Äôt. Belief doesn‚Äôt revamp your odds of winning. Belief doesn‚Äôt distort reality the way you see fit. If she actually defeats him in some manner, I‚Äôll be disappointed. 

It ruins the whole horror aspect to be frank. I want there to be absolutely no way to physically overcome Michael. There should be nothing but pure dread and acknowledgement of the inevitable when he comes. None of this, ‚ÄúOh he killed my dog so now it‚Äôs on‚Äù garbage. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to beat him, you should just be able to merely survive his presence. 

That‚Äôs the thrill in my opinion! When characters have to use their heads and use every survival instinct in order to not succumb to Michael‚Äôs sadistic behaviors. Characters trying to close their closet door 3 times and then open it only to die is hilariously absurd. C‚Äômon now..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,IT SPOILS THE MOVIE AT THE END OF THE TRAILER!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ugh, honestly it looks like another female ""I'm a badass girl!"" cliche film using a legendary title. Hope I'm wrong, I just want good ole fashion Michael Myers wrecking kids."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'd go see it, but Jamie lee Curtis.... Trump 2020."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck








Yes"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, this actually looks great! Can't wait to see it!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been waiting for this since the last Halloween I'm to hype
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Added to watch later* because i dont want nightmares
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited for this!! üò¨üò¨ My favorite horror franchise. It looks really good. #Halloween2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Creepy hopefully in this Halloween that doesn't happenüò∞üòÇüò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer blew both of zombies hilarious attempt at the franchise. I'm pumped!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Back to scare me as an adult - _-
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't look like Mike Meyers to me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,When i was a kid i always used to think Michael Myers was hiding in my closet.....sleep well kids lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm super excited! Michael was by far my Favorite. Him, and Chucky for sure!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I WOULD DESTROY HIM......
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to watch it so bad just watched jigsaw so ready for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i'm in!  kick some ass, jamie lee!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I miss Donald Pleasence! He was a great actor. Reminded me of my grandad. Was very sad when Donald passed away in 1995. About time Haddonfield looked like Haddonfield again. Never thought I'd seen another good Halloween, but I think it's here...yeh baby woo hoo lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else never get scared from movies anymore they just make me laugh
ek1ePFp-nBI,What age is this any1

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If the others on the roof jumpin around were considered crazy what did the call micheal, he never moved..oh wowza üëåüèæ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes Jamie Lee Curtis is back this looks like it‚Äôs gonna fucking awesome I‚Äôm hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,"HalloweeN and HalloweeN II are two of those scary films that regardless of how many times you've seen them, still scare the living shit out of you!! The music, the ""jump scares"", etc, no matter, these movies have a timeless scare factor,....and let us not forget that creepy, ""fish belly"" white mask, courtesy of Tommy Lee Wallace & Captain Kirk. I can't wait to see this new installment, I really do hope it's good. Just remember he's out there, lurking around, pounding the pavement in those Vietnam jungle boots."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When they in the closet






Oh damn that's scary"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Could have the potential to be one of the best horror movies to come out in years, so excited! The original was the one movie that legitimately terrified meüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Really happy to see a new Halloween movie even though I don't like how they will modernize the Halloween series but whatever hopefully it has a good story.

On a side note they should make a proper third installment to the series to make up for season of the witch to fill in the blank between parts 2 and 4 that would be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis reminds me of the old grandmother in Jeepers Creepers (2001) with the shotgun imao
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait üëªüéÉüòµ
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's going on with all the classic '80s thrillers?First IT now Halloween!I saw IT and I loved it although I've never seen the first version (I was too scared to watch it alone although I'm 38).I hope the new Halloween is good too. And I'm glad that Jamie Lee Curtis didn't mess with her face and she's completely natural.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a 26 year old man who I rarely goes to a cinema. I just watch movies online. I've only went to a cinema once since I was fourteen years old. This movie and the Lego Movie 2 are the only movies enticing me to visit a cinema. I've been anticipating the trailer for months. I wanna see it as soon as it's released without the terrible pirated quality shit that firsts surfaces online üëç Been a fan of the original since I was seven years old!!!! I like the idea of the other sequels being paid tribute but removed from the real events of the story line. I'd much prefer to see Micheal being portrayed in a more human way. The whole supernatural stuff was too wack and got old quick. The trailer looks promising üòÅ Lets hope it's a good one!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wow that line "" It's not her brother that's something they made up""  lmao,  some fans are going woohoo and some are going eh wtf but most are going FUCK YOU!!  
film looks good but have to say."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The HYPE!!!!!! üòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,The mask is of Shatner's face so I wonder if he gets a royalty check from the studio.
ek1ePFp-nBI,best newest movies fil box on tv
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope this does really well then maybe we can get a decent Nightmare on Elmstreet that doesnt suck.  Come on Robert just come back once more.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks fucking terrible,Rob Zombies Halloween‚Äôs are ten times better"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back :D NICE!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hi I‚Äôm just any ordinary guy looking for some subs so I‚Äôf you could spare some time and sub that would be highly appreciated thanks
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cheesy trailer. Looks like I expected, total shite."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:08 Ish or 2:07 there's somebody else in the other window on the left side
ek1ePFp-nBI,love that theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer looks damn good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why tf would they call it Halloween! Just making shit more confusing. Like call it Halloween something not just Halloween. Like Halloween Revival, Halloween Resurgence, anything idek just ANYTHING!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lmaooo at 2:42 I just thought  of the vine of the dude saying ""surprise motherfucker"" and started cracking up"
ek1ePFp-nBI,if you pause right at 1:49 you can see that its not michael hitting down the door.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers I‚Äôm trying to kill that pu-






 ssy (WEEET)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers vs Jason Vorhees that will be a good movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see his freaking face man! And he‚Äôs like a grandpa right now so how tf is he killing all these peopleüòÇüò≥
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder who's going to play Micheal?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait so Laurie isn‚Äôt related to Micheal?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes and Jamie Lee Curtis back again....I've always loved the Halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,My hopes are high
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be good because Jigsaw was a disappointment tbh and I don‚Äôt want this to be the sameüò£
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so scared of Michael Myers üò¶
ek1ePFp-nBI,How is that Jamie Lee looks scarier than Mike Myers!  Noooooooo!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This should be been called *HALLOWEEN: H40*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt he kill his sister in Halloween H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""He's waited for this night. He's waited for me.""




""I've waited for him""

BADASS"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This trailer is oddly underwhelming, seems more like a reboot of Halloween H20 or something. I was expecting more from the trailer, Carpenter producing this movie is cool, but that's  hardly a stamp of quality anymore! They need to reboot the whole thing in my opinion, make Michael Myers young and just set in present day Haddonfield. Just don't mention it to Rob Zombie!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell ya definitely watching this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's just hope this will restart the love for the franchise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"jason scares of water
freedy scares of fire 
leatherface scares of his own face
vampires scares of light and Michel myers have no weaknes"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The 17th Sheep Television - Christianity, Prophecy, End Times and more! http://www.17sheep.tv"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Check out my latest video, it will fuck u up!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So basically this is the 3rd remake of this film
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will be good. Zombie did Halloween a disservice last time. This will be much better since JC is backüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,*_MICHAEL MYERS NEVER HAD THE MAKINGS OF A VARSITY ATHLETE._*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Feminism is cancer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay so now it's Halloween H40? Bc last time they did the same exact thing only it was H20
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shook
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why pay for a movie, when you can just watch the plot through the trailer? Could you have left something to get excited about?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don‚Äôt be filled with sjw
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:27 acting....
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she died in one of them were she was a hospital patient!. I‚Äôm so confused
ek1ePFp-nBI,Check out my trailer on this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse might have two on their hands with this and the Spawn reboot.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hi e
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope if they show his face he has that slight deformity *which why he had that when as a kid he was normal* in his eyes like we saw for those two seconds in the original before loomis shoots him first in the house.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times they going kill this nigga
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again -_-
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason has been spamming the dislike button
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be stupid.... They totally ignored JAMIE and John and the baby!!! Like wtf.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,We've been waiting...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The Halloween theme give me goosebumps lol, after seeing this trailer I am convinced this will be good roll on Oct 19th"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just seeing Jamie Lee Curtis makes this totally wirth it!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i wonder if the reporter has something to do with his escape and he might be the second figure up in the window when Laurie shoots the mirror unless Michael casts a reflection from the room across the house.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is a fool and he is one swiftty ass MF!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, he's a wicked, evil, mass murderer, yet rather then disembowel and decapitate him,they keep him alive on taxpayers dollars where he gets meals and cable TV. Yep. believable."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This.....actually looks pretty solid. Nothing that stands out as obvious/annoying/modern that we've seen a thousand time sin the last so many years. The long extended scene of him in the closet as she opens it in one take is actually pretty good and feels...original that of the series it self somehow.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michel Myers: I don't want friends I want audi sorry bitch I don't say srry
ek1ePFp-nBI,IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music alone is anxiety producing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now imagine if they would just live somewhere else or left their home over Halloween and Michael is like, where the fuck is everyone?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Old women with shotguns is an aesthetic to be explored, ya'll."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks amazing! But scary as fuck, which is really saying something , coming from me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do they keep trying to shoot him when HE'S INVINCIBLE?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael looks a like a goofy everything is trash now a days rappers celebs and movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks clich√©, lacklustre and tired like the franchise"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ooooh I can't wait! Only prob is jlc always looks like she's gonna do something funny or silly
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Good thing she was in a bathroom stall cause if it were me then every time a tooth hit the floor, I would shit myself each time in perfect synchronisation"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally , the long wait has come to an end...i remember i used to search alot about this movie and read many opinions some said its just a rumor for this movie to come out coz the series has ended already...different mouth different openions...and now am watchin a final trailer..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Mikey's back! They better do this one right, so for now lets not ever mention what Rob Zombie did to the films! üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't do another one!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i feel like the plot twist will b the grandmother who went crazy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why ignore Halloween 2 and other films
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dang, this looks amazing! The mask looks perfectly detailed, and the quality is amazing, and I love the main character, and it's not just some kid or teen, finally someone older to fit this story more, this looks amazing, can't wait to see it!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My boyfriend finally backü§™! Been waiting too long for thisüò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm gonna watch this and buy the Halloween skins in fortnite
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Girl: Bruh why ain't this closet closing lmao üòÇ
*opens*
Michael: Yo"
ek1ePFp-nBI,ohohoho after year and years
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn the new John Wick 3 looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes a real scary movie can't wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm here for it
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs crazy that a 70 year old man will be playing Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal can you just fuck off now
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sucks that Halloween II is being ignored. Anyways I'm hyped for this movie. Love the new mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next they should do a sequel with Danielle Harris reprising her role as Jamie Lloyd.  It can ignore her death in Part 6 and all the sequels/remakes since.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm almost as excited for this as I am for Elder Scrolls 6
ek1ePFp-nBI,woohoo not a remake :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they're just going to pretend that all the sequels never happened? üòÑ smh
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéÉüî™

ek1ePFp-nBI,DAMMMMNNNNN this looks so good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The boogeyman lives, the king returns."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks like it lacks all the atmosphere the original had. The only good Halloween are the original and Season of the Witch. The first is the best horror film of all time though.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope is better than Rob Zombie`s Remake`s
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks scary good. It's basically an alternative version of Halloween 2 1981. So basically it's the only other alternative time line that matters. Can't wait.üéÉüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtf? Doesn't that make micheal like 60-70 years old? xD
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCKING DOPE
ek1ePFp-nBI,Coming out Nov 1.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has to be a good one
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this comes to most cinemas and isn‚Äôt one of those films that just gets released on dvd in Tesco extra for ¬£3
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee Curtis hey i name sir name is Curtis too ^^
ek1ePFp-nBI,I mean what did you expect to happen when you held up the mask? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Come on plz 10m views
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter is back!! You already know it's going to be epic..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one ? Seriously? Is this necessary? Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they revitalize this franchise after those pathetic attempts from Rob zombie.. God those were awful!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The physciatric  ward was filmed at my school now I just have to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is only a sequel to the first one?

ek1ePFp-nBI,These are the real horror movies. Not the stupid budget FaceTime horror films.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks poi
ek1ePFp-nBI,"We must Worship the God of Israel, Obeying the Commandments of the Torah (Exodus 20).
We should not look at these types of movies that have a pagan nuance and that is sin before God, according to the Commandments of the Torah.

ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited always loved the series
ek1ePFp-nBI,God Bless everyone Amen an Blessed one everybody Amen
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's a Halloween movie in the style of The Purge. Looks badass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,h.....e'.......s.........b...a...c...k...:)
ek1ePFp-nBI,i loved nr 1 and 2 with jamie and i cant wait too see this wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait a minute, she had a son. What happened to her son? Now is a daughter?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Michael escapes just like Harrison Ford in The Fugitive and Laurie Strode turns the tables on him ah la Nightmare on Elm Street--imaginative.
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years later and Jamie lee Curtis has still got it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let her crap first!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"don't like that they remade and threw in familiar pop ups,and encounters with m.m,people aren't stupid,even if they aren't fans can spot that,you just copied other scenes, from your own stash,why"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jc yous all know this movie going to be crazy sad tho that the original Michael Myers ain‚Äôt in there so sad indeed but we‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs an outstanding movie I kinda dislike the teaser trailer it kinda looked like not so great actor were a bit lame if yous humans know what I mean but I love people that were born to act and pros but yeah let‚Äôs see how this new Michael Myers plays the role I like the killer plus the guts & gore yummy eh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should be a spoiler alert in the tittle
ek1ePFp-nBI,OOoOoOoo my nipples are hard!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original mask is BACK
ek1ePFp-nBI,I shot him 600 times....he's not human....- Dr Loomis
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait I‚Äôm confused how is Jamie lee Curtis still alive In this I‚Äôm the 2002 one she dies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't know about this film, but could someone stop beating that dead horse?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looking forward to this oneüî™üî™ (horror movie buff so I have expectations for this)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn nobody havent killed him yet dead yet. god damn but I wanna this
ek1ePFp-nBI,The night he came homeüéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's the point making an other Halloween movie?  Seen. One see them. All
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do you believe in the boogie man you should

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:35 Got me omfg I jumped up
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Halloween for me this year in staying home
ek1ePFp-nBI,YO ITS JASON
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so incredibly stupid it‚Äôs crazy at this point when it comes to remakes these days I‚Äôm already expecting the worst they should of left this with the rob zombie remake he did a great job and I could of sworn Michael killed his sister in Resurrection üòë
ek1ePFp-nBI,I knew he was in the closet and I still jumped lmfao!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks shit

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this the new ver?
ek1ePFp-nBI,let‚Äôs goooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The first Halloween was incredible. The Rob Zombie remake was also incredible. This movie has a lot to live up to and I really hope it does
Edit: I'm not comparing the original Halloween and the Rob Zombie version. They're both great in their own ways in my opinion. Its fine if you don't agree but I still like the movie. Clearly the original Halloween is better but the RZ one was good too"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*C A N   N O T   W A I T*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been waiting a long time for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Any one know official release date of this film

ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis been watching John Wick Movies!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As usual they show way too much in the trailer.. And this is going to suffer from being in 2018.
It looks decent enough. Just my opinion"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait.... is this going to be rated R? Because i hope so!
ek1ePFp-nBI,why the fuck would you bring the killer his mask and dangle it in front of him whilst the whole lunatic asylum goes berserk?
ek1ePFp-nBI,LAME!
ek1ePFp-nBI,But it said 1978 that was a long time ago he's not real jeez
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the 6 second trailer before the actual trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Note to self :

ek1ePFp-nBI,This creep gave me nightmares as a fricking child. Whenever I'd get lippy to my cousins they'd tell me Michel Myers  upstairs
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike is back after forty years.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"And what I like is how Michael's mask looks exactly the same as the one from the first movie, except aged a bit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssuhhhhü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I seriously cannot wait to watch this, and then review it after, I like Halloween for many years, the movie that is."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You're an ass to STILL be in the same county after all of these year...Like come on, you must be stupid."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh Yeahhhhh!! Can‚Äôt wait!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm fucking hype

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:03 did I see cheryl blossom ?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why does his mask look CGI? 
Better not be like Halloween H20 where you have a CGI mask, and 5 other real masks in different parts of the movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I keep watching this trailer as if something new is gonna show up.... I‚Äôm really excited!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,is Shatner Ok with this?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Originality, Hollywood! Originality! SMH."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait. Love Halloween! Jamie Leigh Curtis, cool. Live the theme music."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"White people are so trashed

See a ghost, demon, a maniac chasing tryna kill them. Run them slip, like why tf are you sliping the place ain't wet. You slip them crying out for help. ""oh no plz don't kill me""


Pathetic."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is Halloween, this is Halloween! 
Falala lala"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't Jamie Lee Curtis character get killed by Michael Myers in the previous Halloween film I'm confused lol üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween should have been left alone after the first film.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dear youtube users:

Roses are red
Violets are blue 



I am going trick'r'treating with you, 60 year old man is butchering humans too"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Meh.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What I don't get is that the mental asylum is a red and white chess board..?
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"All of these ""masters"" of horror are a fucking joke. Literally. They do goofy 80s bullshit. Craven, carpenter, barker, etc. Now we have this atrocity. Grandma and grandpa myers duking it out. I thought this was settled with h20. Cmon hollywood. Do something original, thats also not boring as fuck like it comes at night. No zombies, serial killers, aliens, or insectoids of any kind. Think annihilation but not such a vague ending."
ek1ePFp-nBI,it looks like a good movie I would like to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,i want it to be 3D or Imax
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like this has been so many times. Nothing new.
ek1ePFp-nBI,These new horror films just aren‚Äôt  creepy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"please don't be bad

ek1ePFp-nBI,"The part at 1:25 is sick. If that‚Äôs Michael that the car stops in front of, his motions are already creepy af"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It should be a very good Halloween this year üòÇüëê üëê üëê
ek1ePFp-nBI,First one...good...after that it just got terrible.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It doesn‚Äôt look bad, but it‚Äôs so different from the original. It looks more like a psychological thriller than the original horror movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not another Hollywood remake. Are we on Halloween 7 ? same old story
ek1ePFp-nBI,so stupid it is not the real Michael myers  character
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks good, I didn‚Äôt really care for Rob Zombies reboot but the original movies were awesome"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be the worth of money and gas also im 11 idc if im not allowed i waiting for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So yeah, I need a babysitter Oct 19."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope he doesn't have tombstone and goes for slugging the whole match :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit... which one is the boogeyman?  Jamie Lee Curtis looks baaaaddddd
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I love the Halloween series
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh geez, another horror film that overexplains ""what happened"".  And Laurie Strode as Sarah Conner?  This looks like a disaster."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh fun the thing that gave me nightmares
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks horrible
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:09 there‚Äôs another person at the other window
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit gonna scare the lord outtta me.

ek1ePFp-nBI,bo vaping pen is the pen in the movie.

ek1ePFp-nBI,broooooooüôÄüôÄüôÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,SON!  When that original score hits-brings back such GREAT memories of the 70's-80's horror genre!  Michael Myers was ALWAYS the scariest to me!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Movie better not be shit. Just like with the strangers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks half good half bad, Jamie Lee Curtis after all she's been through no way would she want to free him I don't care how cold her vaginas gotten over the years."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This 
Doesn't 
Look 
So
Good
......"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man I Love Trailers. They never spoil any scenes :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't know what's more ridiculous. that they keep rehashing this shit or that I keep watching it. well, I won't be watching one.

""No. That was not her brother, that was something people made up""

As a fan."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YES!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Looks Like Trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Are you serious? Blumhouse productions?..... this production is one of the worst movie producers ever I just hope they don‚Äôt fuck this movie up but if I‚Äôm being honest, I want this movie to be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"LOL I should do a spoof where they accidentally send him to Mexico, it would be a severe horror, michael and other inmates hiding from the cartels LOL."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hi guys, My GF & I started our own accessories store and we‚Äôre about to open!! We have accessories for men,women, couples, friends, family, phone accessories and so much more. It would mean a lot if you guys checked it out! Www.stoneandgrandeur.com & follow us on Instagram @stoneandgrandeur"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Another one? Jaysus they're  really dragging the shite outta these franchise films. What number are we upto now? Must be 10th one or so? Same old story, same old shite. Mental patient escapes from a nuthouse, puts on mask, grabs a kitchen knife & goes on a killing spree every Halloween. And I don't know why Jamie lee Curtis is getting all tooled up with guns & firing bullets at him? Do they not know by now that guns don't seem to kill him. Or is this Hollyweird doing the bad arse 3rd wave feminist shite that no one cares about? Can they not come up with new ideas & stories for films anymore? And then let me guess, it's left open at the end for another one to be made. This is why I can't stand modern films. Just the same old crap redone over & over again. I haven't even seen it but I know what the storyline is all about. But people still waste money to see the same plot line bullshite."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm Wonder if he kills Laurie strode in this movie ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,I came when all the psycho start losing it in the yard. Just literally jizzed everywhere

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this is basically H20, again which was basically Halloween again .. 

Y'know, I'm finding this whole 'reboot' thing extremely tiring."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So what‚Äôs the right order of the Halloween movies leading up to this one so I can see all them
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey, but didn't jaime lee curtis' character get killed in that Halloween h20, after 20 years, no not the h20, i think its the 1 with busta rymes, she gets killed like 15 minutes into the movie, so how is she still alive now in this movie?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandma with the Blue Pump.
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck u  micheal myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is Halloween üéÉ

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I read about it last year and now it‚Äôs near time to hit the theaters. I‚Äôm sooooo excited!! I love Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween. Let‚Äôs pray she doesn‚Äôt die and there are more sequels. 6 films to the original Halloween have been ignored but like they said in Scream 4, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck with the original!‚Äù"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did John Carpinter eradicated Halloween 2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I I'm going to see this movie so bad
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pfffff you can tell from the trailer that this falls just short of being a shite comedy. No surprise no new material NOTHING..... boring
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG I WAS TALKING TO MY PARENTS ABOUT THE NEW HALLOWEEN AND INWAS JUST LIKE I CANT WAIT AND NOW THE LEGIT UNIVERSAL PICTURES AS A TRAILER IM SEEING THIS THE FIRST DAY IT COMES OUT YAY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah...no thanks, the trailer was a disappointment, hopefully, the movie is good but I get this feeling it won't be..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like imagining he door repeatedly slamming on his face and him struggling not to go ""oof"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think that style is copied from the Joker( Heath Ledger)
ek1ePFp-nBI,If rob zombie aint directing...dont want any part of it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess the mask aged..cuz the bitch has wrinkles too hahahah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can‚Äôt they just let him die, why Are they still milking this cow?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Go Vincent!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve watched this trailer so many times and my only question is why is Judy Greer (actress playing Laurie‚Äôs daughter) wearing a Christmas sweater on Halloween? (2:05 for reference)

ek1ePFp-nBI,So Halloween movies has multiple different stories. Which is a 1st for a horror movie. 1978 Halloween with the H2(1981) and the rest of the halloween movies except H3 which doesnt have michael in it. To Halloween 1978 to this new one 2018 Halloween is a whole different story
ek1ePFp-nBI,So if they are ignoring 2 thru 8.  They arent canon anymore?  What about all those people that paid to see the movies and buy the blurays? They should get refunds by the studio.  They lied to the fans for 40 years? Id sue them. You cant do this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaaay! Another remake!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another trailer that gives away the story and the scares. üòí
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I do like Halloween, but this movie doesn't look very good. I guess I'll watch it though."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Caralho menor
ek1ePFp-nBI,yessssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hollywood couldn't make an Original movie if its life depended on it

ek1ePFp-nBI,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm actually excited to see a movie that ignores other sequels. I want to see Michael be a person rather than some  mysterious un-killable monster.
ek1ePFp-nBI,COMING OCTOBER 2018: The Shape Lives: 40 Years of Halloween - an all new documentary. See the teaser trailer here: https://youtu.be/idhYFJOdiyI

ek1ePFp-nBI,The first Halloween is one of my favorite movies of all time (let‚Äôs forget about the sequels and remakes) so I‚Äôm really excited for this movie. I hope they put the same amount of tension and fear from the first movie and put it in this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael never needed a reason to kill anyone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Should have started from the end of H2 and claim Loomis died in the fire, what's the story line on Dr. Loomis for the new film?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,cool

ek1ePFp-nBI,Purge + Walking dead + Michael Myers = Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love that Jamie Lee Curtis is in it. I hope its going to be good. Is it rated PG or R I hope R?
ek1ePFp-nBI,*üçÖ%* 99%
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thr bathroom stall thing is one thing I fear
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesses
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hasn't this fucking movie been made like 8 times? and everytime they just rewrite the story. The first two were good. Just let things die
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's pretend the Rob Zombie films never happened...
ek1ePFp-nBI,üî™üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so exited to watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back for more this Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm just praying that it will live up to expectations. What I'm more concerned about are the trendy kids who are going to think this is an original flick. Unless they saw the original Halloween movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dbd...

ek1ePFp-nBI,Dr.Loomis son
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ima watch this on haloween night lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did they get a 60 year old to be Michael or is it just some random stuntman I don't care either way I just think it would be a little funny
ek1ePFp-nBI,I saw that house in jumanji 2 at 0:59
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit looks on point!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hold up.... didn't Jamie Lee die in 2002's Halloween: Resurrection? (The actor she portrayed... not actually her ;)

ek1ePFp-nBI,super excited and Jamie Lee Curtis is in it still that's badass!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Omg I can't wait, Jamie Lee Curtis is back, and I'm so happy John Carpenter is involved with it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,From this trailer you can see a lot of different conflicting stories with the original I don‚Äôt think this will be worth watching sorry ! Just another way of Hollywood trying to dig in our pockets on crap !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"One can only hope this will be good, especially if this has John Carpenter's name stamped on it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I legit can't wait for this, I'm so hyped!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How does Jamie Lee Curtis keep surviving?? Like huh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bakeas
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting......
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one that can relate to and root for the masked assailants?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Universal always makes the best horror films
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 I think I'm playing Dead by Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm just hoping the lil kid at the end of the trailer lives
ek1ePFp-nBI,My question is why is he after Laurie strode?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next i want Friday the 13th
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:02 is this Madelaine Petsch?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks so good ! Gna see this in theatres
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn nigga
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love this series; I had a crush on JLC growing up, but I've gotta say there are some things that just need to be left dead. Laurie Strode is a grandma in her fifties which puts Michael at 60 at the youngest. The only thing that frightens me about a senior citizen is when they get behind the wheel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks really good the last 2 pissed me off
ek1ePFp-nBI,please be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone else want to see the second chapter of ‚ÄúIT‚Äù
I do"
ek1ePFp-nBI,William Shatner is Back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i hope this comes out on halloween hahah
ek1ePFp-nBI,An entire series of movies based around the scariest 8 notes in history... LOL
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don‚Äôt let this distract that TayK  got death penalty but not Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH YES BABY!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stalker much?
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT CAN'T WAIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,My mom and dad won‚Äôt let me see this XD but pretty good trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music made it funny
ek1ePFp-nBI,"W8, is this a sequel 2 Resurrection? Or another reboot? Why no better title than just Halloween? This is like the 3rd film in the series w/ that exact same title! Hollywood is so effing confusing... But it does look like a worthy successor 2 Curseüòà"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks good - a slasher that isn't trying to be just a silly slasher film.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was in the middle of having my Halloween movie watching marathon when i happen to find this on YouTube.  I'm a big micheal Myers fan. But some movies should be left alone after awhile
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ay
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:45 is that you pingu damn it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks good ! ..i look forward to it!..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm very confused. How was he in captivity for the last 4o years, if he's been killing people every Halloween. Are the timelines of any of the other Halloween movies relevant? AND how does he keep escaping from these mental institutions? Seems like someone should be fired for negligence or am I over thinking this?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs a modern scary movie 90% chance it will suck
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can you close the closet door?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm a huge Halloween fan and am definitely looking forward to this. I like the idea of ignoring all the sequels, but the problem I have is the 40 year wait. That seems like an awful long time for payback, seeing that Laurie Strode is now 57 and Michael Myers is 61. But I guess if Sean Connery can play a 60 yr old character imprisoned for 30+ years and still be in shape to help fight terrorists (The Rock), LOL, then I guess a slasher can do it too (replace terrorists with babysitters tho lol)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I take it this isnt tieing into where Halloween Resurrection left off?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so glad this movie is wiping the slate clean. The first one is the only one that mattered. The Rob Zombie  reboots were trash. Making him come from a broken home as opposed to him just being evil? Lame.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dr Loomis would be proud
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Time is a cruel fate!üò¢  jamie was so beautiful back in the day, shame to see her age like that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,6.4k Who just peed on their pants...
ek1ePFp-nBI,The dropping of the teeth. Oh shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Trick or Treat*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Josh Hornett played the son in Halloween H20. I wish they had brought him back for this since the brought Jamie Lee Curtis back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks mad
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who is he after in this one ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought this was some dead by daylight trailer but dam its the real thing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:18 Oh my god
ek1ePFp-nBI,hmmm if the old women gonna shoot and kill him than its a fckdup movie!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter baby
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you slow it down by 0.25x speed at 1:50, you will see It's Hall wtf. So, Hall is the killer?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant believe my eyesüòå Finally Michael is back. Cant wait to watch this isw.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh no üò≠üò≠I‚Äôm terrified all ready I have chills down my back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Waiting for the movie and just amazed by the trailerüòò
ek1ePFp-nBI,He was shot six times and survived. Stabbed in the neck with a knitting needle and survived so I think he has to be something a little bit beyond human. I knew they would have to go and fuck it up.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael!! Go get the Kardashians!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like a great version on today‚Äôs Halloween feel perfect üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,S√≥ de ver esse trailer estou apavorada üòÇüòÇüòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,He's baaaaaack!!!!üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have played too much dead by daylight at first i thought i will see generators all over their house lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks fricking awesome #riaslist
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Am I the only one who notices they changed the trailer caption from ""This year"" to ""This Halloween"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers would be 61 now ü§ì
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't care who the hell you are you can't shoot a 4570 that accurately
ek1ePFp-nBI,The cops finna show up on october 20th SMH...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let her finish doing her business in the bathroom Michael üí©
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:14 pretty good shot with a pistol. Very nice center mass
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE ORIGINAL HALLOWEEN CAME OUT IN 1978...THE YEAR I WAS BORN...I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS FILM AS IT PICKS UP WHERE IT ALL LEFT OFF...WELCOME HOME MICHAEL...IVE BEEN EXSPECTING YOU..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe this is gonna be like scream 4 
Everybody thinks that sucks but was great"
ek1ePFp-nBI,i managed to jerk off to this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Coming next chinese new years

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So we‚Äôre just got forget about Halloween h2o, resurrection, and all the ones with Jamie Lloyd?!?!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandpa Michel vs Grandma Jamie Lee Curtis....
ek1ePFp-nBI,IT'S THE HASH SLINGING SLASHERüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:54 did you hear the jurassic park  beginning lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,The way she teases and screams ‚ÄúMichaelllll‚Äù in such a taunting way is so badass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YEAAAH! THIS IS HOW HORROR MOVIES WERE MEANT TO BE MADE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Cena is in this trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck this dumass movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween it is far from Halloween why is this movie trailer number one trending on YouTube
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,one of the best horror movie ever https://youtu.be/qL7U894o9HI
ek1ePFp-nBI,"MICHEAL!!! YOOOOUR BAAACK!!
I WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this leather face? Or is this Michael Myers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,4k?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The poor kids at the end
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:03 EW3 üòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,lame ass movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Almost 10m viewsüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Has anybody noticed the New Halloween Movie is released on Michael Myers' Birthday üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will be the best slasher movie in 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,god i love michael myers but i know this movie is gonna be bullshit just like that rob zombie garbage that came out last
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooo... this is ignoring all of the past sequels and is meant as a continuation of the first film. I get that but I don‚Äôt get why. Haven‚Äôt we already done enough sequels to that original film. Even the idea of ignoring some of the bad sequels has been done already. And Laurie coming back has also been done. Only thing that‚Äôs new here is that now they are also ignoring the first (and only good) sequel. Still don‚Äôt see the point to this film though. I get the feeling that it‚Äôs going to be yet another mediocre sequel and a decent reheating of the original film at best. At worst it‚Äôll be yet another awful sequel to be ignored in the future once they reboot this thing again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHAT THE! A 2018 movie with creepy scares instead of jump scares. What world am i living in.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Meyers i'm tryna kill that puss-y
ek1ePFp-nBI,Takes me back to when I watched the fist one back in 1990.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:07 who is the other guy. In the blue lighting, is it the real Micheal"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Excuse me somebody is in here.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What do you think about NOED?
I AM THE NOED"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love to see Jamie Lee Curtis back....she is awesome....but watching ""Halloween Part 48"" is not something I want to do. Wish her the best at the box office thou."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I‚Äôve seen the film and it‚Äôs shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don‚Äôt let this distract you from Michael walking as fast as the person who‚Äôs running away
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:30 Am I the only one that knew he was going to be standing there?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Strong trailer. Jamie looks pretty damn good in real life for her age, it's a wig you spastics."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love when the trailers have their own trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Same story ...as old many movies...üòï...but I'll go to watch...üòä

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay I'm a huge fan of Halloween but how do we explain the other films like 4, 5, 6, H20 and Resurrection? They tried to bring the curse of the Thorn which took the suspense out of Micheal in my personal opinion. This is getting a bit confusing to understand. Did the other sequels never happen? Did Laurie have nightmares through the other films? I'm starting to lose interest how this is going to playout or if it's going to be a good redemption. It's starting to get a little too confusing."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Never really watch these Michael Myers or Friday the 13th movies but THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only way to truly kill Michael is to let someone other than John Carpenter direct or produce Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow amazing can't wait for this one. Looks fantastic let's hope so. Love this stuff.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"All of these slasher movies coming out, they need to make a Terrordrome Movie soon."
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if they will explain how Micheal Myers was captured.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nick Castle who played Michael in 1977, is playing Michael again¬†in this film.
 I like that¬†the age appropriateness of Laurie and Michael, is¬†being taken into consideration. 
Just in this trailer alone¬†you can see that Mr. Castle, has the movement and stance of the shape down perfect. 
All the other Michael's can not compare!
And a pixie haircut Laurie Strode is thankfully a thing of the past."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who is excited to watch this movie 


But I am so excited"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My opinion as a late 20 something is I am SO HAPPY to see a movie that is not centred around another young actor. It becomes too much of the same same. I like age diversity. Besides I can‚Äôt stand horror movies where the lead is some young thing with his or her chest out as bait. I‚Äôm watching it for horror. This trailer looks like the scare comes from suspense which is my kind of horror movie. Plus I think it‚Äôs iconic to see Jamie Lee Curtis return as Laurie Strode. I literally don‚Äôt care if people disagree with me. I just wanted to put my comment out there with the ones telling Jamie to hang it up. My comment is go get it girl! It‚Äôs nice to see people not being boxed in. We are all going to be older one day. I‚Äôve always been able to relate & like other people via personality not age & that‚Äôs why I am glad to see some mature actors that I adore still getting parts. IMO regardless of my views on age it looks as if Jamie successfully fills the part.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for October!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks awful. I know the explanation is that Michael was apprehended in the original, and this is a sequel that takes place after the original, and completely ignores anything after the original. But these changes seem more pointless than anything.

Laurie strode not being his sister was a dumb decision, now he has almost no reason to go after her besides ""he be fucked up and want to kill people.""

Atleast with her being his sister you could say that he wanted to end his bloodline or some shit which actually gives him a semblance of a reason to actually go after her. A reason that anyway has more depth than ""He's a nut, crazy in the coconut."" and just likes to kill random babies sitters because whatever else he was doing just got boring to him.

And for a movie that is supposed to be a sequel to the original, it honestly looked like a remake of the original.

Now that I know it's a sequel that takes place 40 years after the original, alot of this is starting to make more sense. But that still doesn't explain the unneeded retconning done. 

If they retconned the whole ""Michael is controlled by a cult"" shit then that'd be fine. Or at the very least try to write that plot element better. But don't retcon stuff like the blood relations between him and Laurie that gave him a reason to go after her. That's just so dumb, and unneeded. I'll give this movie a shot but it just doesn't look like it'll be very good. 

It looks like it might actually be worse than the Rob Zombie remakes."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"John McCain ?!
1:14"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Time to switch up reality and create ur own paradox soundcloud.com/paradox2025
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it scary that I was watching both films yesterday ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why the fuck cant they ever recreate the original mask right? The original mask is the only Michael Myers that look right and why isnt Nick Castle doing this role This guy is too tall. Its just another sequel now nothing special about it. If the mask is not same as original and Nick is not the main Micheal , its lost all its specialness"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait for this!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well about damn time a decent horror movie comes out i was starting to lose hope in scary movies relying on jumpscares but not the halloween series these never dissappoint
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nah I liked the older guy, he was much taller and bigger lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back baby
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it‚Äôs a remake of Halloween 2 good it actually looks scary and great
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanna see this..
ek1ePFp-nBI,The optimistic side of me says I should be excited for this movie. But the side of me that has a long history of being disappointed in Halloween sequels says excitement would be unwise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this was supposed to be a direct sequel to the original, since Jamie Lee is in it, then ya think they could have made her look a little younger? Seriously it's laughable"
ek1ePFp-nBI,William Shatner doesn't age well. Lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing hope the movie is good too btw am i the only one who had goosebumps when the music starts at 1:56
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 3

ek1ePFp-nBI,I actually want to see thid
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm excited for this new Halloween film. Awesome to see John Carpenter and Malek Akkad back again, and most of all Jamie Lee Curtis!! I do, however, have a few gripes; I personally thought the brother / sister connection added quite a bit to the storyline, disappointed to see that go. Also (and I know many people will have varied opinions on this) is I preferred Michael's mask when it was a simple white; to me it was much more scary, whereas this mask has more of a ""badass"" image to it. Otherwise I'm hyped about seeing it this October!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh imagine waiting 40 years for a sequel üòØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why they go f-ing wit Mikeyüò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don‚Äôt let this you from the fact that I didn‚Äôt say distract
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They should make a multiplayer game you could play with your friends, kinda like Friday the 13th but better"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks great bring it back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No no no no, okay so Universal Pictures why is it the Halloween movie director Rob Zombie casted doesn't all of a sudden matter? You realized he had legal rights and  intercepted the movie without effecting the previous timelines to the original movies, and was able to finish the final ending. So now new directors are never going to lay a movie to rest? Always sequels always more and more. Why don't you give all that money in production making another movie to charity instead of shitting on art? And respectfully everyone check out House of a Thousand Corpses or Devil's Rejects they are truly great not bias but someone like Rob Zombie is able to expand his creativity should be recognized for his work. Unlike fuck heads in big studios carrying out another horror film just to shit on it.

Yours truly a critic"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this isn‚Äôt a disappointment
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Shame Anthony Bordains girlfriend she was pictured days before cheating on him, then when he confronted her she attacked him on Instagram, hours later he hung himself.....she then deleted the photo and gave a fake speech about her love for him....that sluts name Asia Argento"

ek1ePFp-nBI,at 2:08 there is two Myers in the window top left and right
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween scared me sooo bad when I was little I could barley walk pass the TV when my dad would watch and I hated the music cause it scared my eye balls out my sockets lol but as I got older Michael Myers became my favorite horror movie icon he's way better that Freddy and Jason and the others in my opinion but one thing I hate about this one is they decided to say that Michael isn't related to Laurie cause that's what made the story so cool and scary at the same time that someone sibling (Brother) could kill their relative (sister) also I hope his face isn't shown he also looks a decent size Michael isn't really that big
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter's back. 'Nuff said.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Epic show down is about to be unleashed... ps the last part of the trailer funny as fuck lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please can we get the Halloween 2 theme played in this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh yesssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie franchise has gotten kinda silly i.e. busta rhymes and its time to start fresh similar to what they did with batman begins. And btw i just farted.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What‚Äôs better, Halloween or the Conjuring?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,But John Wick is the Boogeyman
ek1ePFp-nBI,Atheism is correct.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm just here for the music, always gave me chills"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jump scares INTENSIFIES
ek1ePFp-nBI,I personally like that they took some creative liberties.

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:11 Should be the end of the movie right there
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully Michael Myers wins in this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not only is Jaimie back, but so is Nick Castle."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Grandma vs Killer
Who would win?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So you're telling me Michael Myers is not Laury Strodes brother anymore?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this movie is going to ignore the sequels (H2O, Resurrection) that ignored the sequels (Halloween 4, 5 & 6) that ignored the sequel (Halloween 3), and even ignore the original sequel (Halloween 2)?  Which means the ""true"" sequel to Halloween is called Halloween.  For a series that has around fifteen movies at this point, only three are good (1, 2, and 4), and the last good one came out thirty years ago.  I'm gonna give this a big, fat ""whatever."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Everyone lets do a cheers and hope this will justify the frachise. Also, encourage rob zombie to come out with another one. Michael Myers will always triumph everyother villan and he walks."
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSSSSSSSS I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THE HALLOWEEN MOVIES BUT OMG THIS LOOKS SO GOOD

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,A whole new series is gonna be coming!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:08 u know your grandma better than u at fortnight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who all are excited to watch this film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The old female character is smart
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:44 when u broke and its valentine

ek1ePFp-nBI,1:16 when u see your grandma with a rare pump
ek1ePFp-nBI,What I thought Laurie died
ek1ePFp-nBI,the Halloween music is back!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The thing about this that I love, is usually at the end of the trailer they would usually add in a loud noise with a jump scare, but instead of Micheal jumping out of the closet he just stands there which tells me it won‚Äôt be focused on gore it will more focus on tension and suspense which I LOVE."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo this motherfucker has got to be at least in his 50s by now plus his movies did start before both Freddy Krueger 1984 and Jason Voorhees 1981 Halloween came out in 1978.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who is hyped for this to come out
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be Fucking epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how David Gordon Green does something different in every movie.¬† If you watched 3 of his movies in a row you would never know they are made by the same director.
ek1ePFp-nBI,And it‚Äôs really sad that Jamie Lee Curtis has aged that much because I can remember H2O and she was actually still pretty attractive in that movie but now she looks ruff nowa days .
ek1ePFp-nBI,Abbet it‚Äôs not going to be as good as Rob zombie‚Äòs Halloween . I just wish that the original Sam Loomis would‚Äôve still been alive so he could‚Äôve played in Rob zombie movie.  I hate when they screw timelines up on movies because Laurie strode died in the sixth movie .
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,They don't know how to leave well enough alone
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yasss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Really looking forward to this, and we have got pretty bad horror movies over the years. COUGH COUGH truth or dare COUGH COUGH...and maybe we might get worse horror films this year. COUGH the predator COUGH COUGH. But apart from that...this looks amazing"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why were the mental people laughing out of no where?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Subscribe to my channel I‚Äôll sub y‚Äôall back
ek1ePFp-nBI,My hope is raised by the simple fact that it ignores that dreadful resurrection and besides its the only new horror movie that looks any good at all.
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüî•üî•üî•üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,comes out on my birthday fk yeah!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not sure if I wanna see this. They're doing it from a stand point where the other sequels didn't exist. Plus in Halloween H20 Jamie Lee Curtis had a son played Josh Hartnett then died in halloween resurrection. If they're going to do another movie it should be a sequel from the others and not from a stand point like the sequels don't exist.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why did I click this? I deadass hate scary movies üò≠ I hate myself for clicking it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great like if I needed another reason to be scared to use a public restroom
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome!!! Fuck those Rob Zombie movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow! Another Halloween remake
Yes, we‚Äôre getting his origin story again!
Jamie lee Curtis is gonna Laurie strode, but even though she is too old to play Laurie store, but we are seeing Michael Myers, once again"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead By Daylight ruined this for me lmao.
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can't kill Michael Meyers! He's proven to be immortal. That's what we know.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I had to mentally prepare myself before watching this video
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What's more unbelievable, a 60 plus year old man escaping jail and going on a murder spree or a town still exists where children are allowed to walk the street after dark without mommy & daddy holding their hands while they trick or treat :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So... Basically this is Halloween: H20 redone?? Like Halloween: H40? üòÇIdk and idc I will be seeing this movie I'm obsessed with the original Halloween franchise by John Carpenter and I LOVE Jamie Lee Curtis and I kept up with all the story lines since I was a kid but whatever they decide to do I'm here for it as long as Jamie and most of the original creators are a part of it I'm going to see it!!! I love that 40 years later this is still an Iconic movie and October 19th is supposed to be Michael Myer's birthday so this should be really interesting.. Can't wait!!!! 10.19.18 üíØüéÉüî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,At 2:25 wow...I guess Jewish Hollywood felt the original was racist for being all white.Anyone here seeing white people trying to do a remake of Friday?...I swear f****g political correctness.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just more of the same. I'll still see it though.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This oughta be better than the Rob-Zombie bullshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,How tall is Michael Myers in this movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,No honey. This is not my cup of tea. I'm gonna go now. Imma make like a tree and leaf.‚úåüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,didn‚Äôt Jamie Lee‚Äôs character die in Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks amazing, thanks It, horror is back with a force."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope the jump scares are more scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,It doesn‚Äôt look that scary tbh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt waitüòÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally Halloween coming back to its original roots!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"lmao anyone else notice that this movie comes out on Oct 19, 2018 and October 18th is Michael Myers's birthday."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YESSSSSSS BITCH YESSSSSSSüëèüëèüëèüëè WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU MICHAEL ""in my Dr. Loomis voice"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,so fuking excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell ya they finally put a good horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why haven‚Äôt they made a God of War movie yet? The God of War games are basically already a story, so you would just need to adapt it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit if you pause at 2:06 you can see kids wearing the silver shamrock masks from Halloween 3!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know i was going to come here and go WHY?! But.....not I'm actually intrigued even if Curtis is a tool.
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHY ARE THEY ON MY QUAD!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,how many times are these uncreative hollywood losers going to remake a movie? its getting old. come up with something new.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers + October equals the scary month feeling again
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder how long Micheal was waiting in the closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,TRYING 2 COPY ROB ZOMBIE THE CRAWLING TEAR! LMAO!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm not hyped for this, mainly because the movie is ignoring its previous sequels. What I think it will be a good movie is The nun."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It seems like the story is more about the old bitch
ek1ePFp-nBI,"There are references to other parts of the franchise, when he escape with the interns, it's from H1, the bathroom scene it's a reference to H4 and H20, when he puts his mask it's like H5, and the way he moves the knife it's like H20 and HResurrection."
ek1ePFp-nBI,She should've bought herself an AR-15
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit will we finally get another good Halloween film.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes finally üòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Michael is a boogeyman all along??
ek1ePFp-nBI,The 6000+ dislikes must be from people who aren't horror fans. If you have followed this franchise you would be genuinely stoked about this movie. It looks amazing compared to the shit we have received over the last 2 decades.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so excited I can‚Äôt wait to see it when it comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why do they do stuff like this to classic movies,why did they do this they should just leave it alone"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Imagine what micheal had to go through when the sitter tried to keep on closing the door on himüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm just imaging that the door keeps hitting him in the head
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Whelp, time to call John Wick. The guy you hire to kill the fucking boogie man."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 1978 is one of favorite films of all time. This actually looks GREAT. Halloween deserves redemption after a streak of cub lesser films compared to the original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still love the Rob Zombie versions
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 got chills all over my body and a smile from ear to ear!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its hard to get excited over yet another remake of this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29 29
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OMG IM SO EXCITED, HALLOWEEN 2018 IS GOING TO BE AWESOME"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone notice the gunshots when laurie strode is shooting is fornite bolt action sniper sounds lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm glad they went in  this direction  because after the first one they kinda sucked and added too much to the story
ek1ePFp-nBI,is this about michael myers????
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeeeeeesssssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Also Saw Halloween Trailer During The Fear Walking Dead
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the best killers in Dead by Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit it's Michael Myers!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i swear im not watching this. every movie i see people are full sprinting while he's walking with a knife and catches up to them in the next seen. smh.. ill probly watch it though lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, so Danny McBride thought he could come in and all A-list the shit out of the existing series and timeline. I've got news for you, buddy. Kevin Williamson was way more A list than you'll ever be when he scripted H20, which covered all of this already (Jamie Lee returning to the series in her iconic role). Fuck you for your blatant disregard for the work other people put into this series."
ek1ePFp-nBI,You guys know what this calls for right Halloween marathon!! After I find the original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks so good. Can't wait to see original Michael back. üòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Needs next gen JLC T and A.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow. I wonder what happens...sigh.
ek1ePFp-nBI,so first The Purge and then Halloween üòå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They need to stop remaking or adding on to classic horror movies, this is just going to be another cliche ending to what was a great franchise."
ek1ePFp-nBI,All the greatest comedians are making horror movies now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVJzSVp3phc

Jamie Lee Curtis behind the scenes of Halloween more Michael Myers Footage! I didn't know John Carpenter helped write the scrip for this one. So Much to catch up on lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,its june its not even close to halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"hate seeing michael myers get raped movie after movie, thats the real horror.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck, I'm so excited after see Rob Zombie's Halloween, I think thanks to him I'm a Michael Myers fan and his franchise. I'm 22 years old and I can tell you that remakes are sometimes worth it. #HALLOWEEN2018"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Espero que esse filme Seja foda
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait. Go get ‚Äòem Michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet door smacking his face is gonna piss him off!
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is attt
ek1ePFp-nBI,Craziness! Super stoked to see this! YEAHHHHHH! I reacted to this and it'll go up in a day or so!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does the theme song give anyone else goose bumps or is it just me
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie better have a merch store open during January. That shits an untapped market
ek1ePFp-nBI,At the end was funny to me XD
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO EXCITED TO SEE IT üò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,You won't some teeth.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That mask says enough woo! That's is horror at its peak,I'm a fan 4sure!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs go!!! I wanted to be in the movie so Michael could clap my cheeks! I would love to get clapped by Michael. Too bad it won‚Äôt happen :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanna see his face
ek1ePFp-nBI,Imagine watching this Halloween night
ek1ePFp-nBI,2Spooky4Me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh ya
ek1ePFp-nBI,its rated g
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks stupid!
ek1ePFp-nBI,At least it's no longer Rob Zombie directing it & his gay ass bearded homeless characters.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't believe this s**t, this better be the best oneüí™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kill her already
ek1ePFp-nBI,"can‚Äôt believe they called it Halloween again ,"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So for continuity purposes, this is Halloween 2?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is the very first scary movie I ever seen ... The first Halloween that is ... I was very young & it scared the hell out of me . I think the very first one came out in 1978 & if that's the case I was only 5 at the time . I remember being at my uncles house him holding me in his arms me with my hands over my face & peeking through to watch , at the end where his doctor shot him with a stubbed nose 38 at point blank range & Michael falling out of a second floor window to the ground below , then the doctor & Jamie Lee Curtis walking down the steps to the outside of the house where he had fell & he wasn't laying in the front yard just the imprint of where his body landed ... It blew my tiny mind at the time ."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not quite as exciting as Scream 4 from 2011 but this should be a decent sequel to an old horror/slasher franchise
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's been 40 years. Let the series rest in peace. Michael has got to be like 60+ years old, and Jamie Lee Curtis is like 72. SMH."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was kinda a weird kid and when I was 2 I would beg my mom to watch the original Halloween. Idk why but I love horror movies and I fell in love with Halloween especially the theme song. The original is basically my childhood movie üòÇ so this one better not disappoint.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Great. One of my favorite spooky movies is getting a sequel, after 40 years. Just what it needed."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yassssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's awesome however I believe Jamie Lee Curtis died in part 8 the resurrection of Michael Myers. Soooo how is she back??? Even tho I love she is #SCREAM QUEEN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Theirs something I don't get how is he surviving it all he's not anything  paranormal he's like the ghost face but he never dies and why don't they kill him in jail like how can they all be so retardted
ek1ePFp-nBI,In my opinion it should place after Halloween 2 Not 1
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck Yeah I Have Waited over 10 years for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,WhaT ABOUT jASON OR fREDDY CRUGGER ALL THOSE MOVIES GOES TOGETHER
ek1ePFp-nBI,please dont read this thanks
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking love it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope there will be FRIDAY THE 13TH
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Soooooo this cock sucker making a documentary comes into the asylum and taunts Michael and provokes him to escape, So this duchebag is the reason Michael escapes after 40 years. He caused all this shit! What a dick"
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie is insane
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah, but does it have Busta Ryhmes having a showdown with Michael Myers? ‚ÄúTrick or treat......mother fucker!‚Äù."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this movie pg 13 or rated r?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael: *blood is in his hands with teeth*

Jason: Swing first *drives trucks and opens the back with hundreds of body's falling out*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As a kid, Halloween was the only movie I could never grow out of till I was in middle school. After I got over it no horror movie ever phased me and gave me the chills like Halloween did. Ive had a ton of nightmares, when I was younger, and I can still remember that sweet suspense of fear and adrenaline pumping through my veins, arteries coagulating with thrilling suspense and terror. Idc what anyone says, Halloween is phenomenal."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Highkey excited for this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOOKS AMAZING
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is a must see for me üíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,cool. give away the entire fucking movie in the trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I need my Michael myers to be that 7ft behemoth Rob Zombie introduced not some Tom Cruise height havin mf.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Danny McBride?
hmmm"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yea!! The bogey man is back!! ..john wick who?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the first real Halloween movie in 40 years. Most of the shitty cash-grab sequels that followed the first film completely missed the entire point of it and just produced shitty movies to make money and entertain a retarded audience who don't intellectually understand the story Carpenter originally was trying to tell. Can't wait for this. I'm gonna watch the first film right before seeing this in the theater.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HYPE
ek1ePFp-nBI,So hyped that closet scene was perfect üëåüèª
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The original laurie and the original Michael Myers, really glad the original actors came back for the last Halloween."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looking forward to this one.  Always loved the theme music to this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Smh all these comments about this Halloween not being  a part of the rest of the Halloween movies is just dumb to me. How can y‚Äôall say this has nothing to do with H20 or resurrection?? Think about it. If this is a ‚Äúdirect sequel‚Äù why the hell is she trying so hard to kill him? If you just survived from a serial killer, your first thought is not gonna be OH I want to kill him??? No df? This Halloween is after resurrection in my opinion"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thing it's the 10th time I watch this... And I don't know why
ek1ePFp-nBI,I remember Jamie Lee Curtis she played cookie on Ned's declassified!
ek1ePFp-nBI,If you pause at 1:49 you can clearly see that that is not Michael banging on the stall door. It is the British guy who is holding the mask at the start of the film
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing this all started using a really bad Captain Kirk Halloween mask they found...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can October come fast
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank God they‚Äôre making it a sequel after the first one cause I was getting tired of this cult business üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Give it a like!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How about y'all stop making shitty reboots
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay looks actually good üëÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cringeathon.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OMG, this is call horrible movie fantastic. i just scarred in last scene of this trailer..sound effect work very well.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like to think i'm a scaredy cat, like if i'm looking at you and you poke me really fast I will be terrified.
But a horror movie has never scared me ever, not even once.
This looks like a 1/100 movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,JLC looks like she's 80
ek1ePFp-nBI,GRANNY COMING TO GET THAT ASS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuking master piece
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's the mystery that's pulling me in... the fear of the unknown as to why Michael is stalking Laurie still after so many years now that it's all been changed (again)... can't wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I never watch horror movies but I will be screaming my ass off in the movie theatre for this one.  Lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh Ok but i think they should of connected it to the one's rob zombie made to make him even more evil and scary ya know.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Can you close the closet Door?"" 
*Seconds Later.... *JUMPSCARE*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, Mike Myers looks different now! It's ok to call him Mike, I feel like we've known him for.......ever??"
ek1ePFp-nBI,what i'm not understanding is didn't laury strode die in halloween resurrection.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gay
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is a classic.. and my favorite movie as a kid‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§can't wait to watch it..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:51 omg you know what‚Äôs scary about this part




She was being dragged across this dirty ass bathroom"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Michael finally kills the bitch
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks incredible... but it's kind of funny imagining Michael on the other side of the closet being repeatedly squished by the door.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks lame
ek1ePFp-nBI,"IDK if this will top Rob Zombie's version, but this still looks pretty good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm excited that they made one but it's garbage and cheap looking. Rob zombie did a better job
ek1ePFp-nBI,LETS GO I'M EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE IT BEEN 5 OR 6 YEARS ALREADY SINCE A NEW MOVIE OF THESE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I know that this is a movie, but it reinforces my idea of putting RFID chips on criminals."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did Michael actually drop teeth over the stall door?  What???? That‚Äôs so dumb.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many bs times you think shes gonna shoot her gun and no cops will respond to the shootings
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael has come home to reclaim his throne from the retarded movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I still wish they were brother and sister. üòë
ek1ePFp-nBI,How did she survive when she fell off the building?
ek1ePFp-nBI,EVERYBODY THIS MOVIE ISN'T COMING OUT IN JUNE IT'S COMING OUT ON HALLOWEEN!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally Michael came out of the closet !! üòÇü§£ OMG!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, Jamie Lee Curtis looks old!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is the film just called Halloween? No Return of Vengance?
ek1ePFp-nBI,If only avengers called Michael to help vs thanos
ek1ePFp-nBI,They always fucckking sumthin up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great......
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm a fan of the original Halloween film and I hope this movie will do justice to the first film (but it‚Äôs a shame that they don‚Äôt follow the story in Halloween I and II)
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS OMG
ek1ePFp-nBI,Legit counting down the seconds!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I remember seeing the first one as a child and I am so ready to go at it again. Woot
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM READY
ek1ePFp-nBI,I never get tired of michael myers üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,At 2:08 in the upper far left window there is another person stalking there.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesss
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Judging from some of the responses, it seems that most of the casual Halloween audience completely misunderstand the original mythos of the first Halloween and direction Carpenter took it, and why there isn't a brother-sister connection between Michael & Laurie. In the original film there was not one indication that Laurie and Michael were related. He only pursued her and stalked her friends (Annie, Lynda, and Bob) just for the sake of it and because he was the embodiment of evil as explained by Dr. Loomis. Monsters like that have no actual real motive for their actions. The story taking place on Halloween just adds on to the terror since the holiday was already perceived as the ""scariest night of the year"" where crazies come out and do things they wouldn't normally do on other days. Michael is a reflection of all that, and of the urban legend of the mysterious stalker creeping on the babysitter. I'm not sure about anyone else, but the removal of the brother-sister relation makes things more unpredictable in my opinion and why this film will be a huge success."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome. A Halloween movie is nothin without Jamie Lee Curtis
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original was the scariest movie I have ever seen.
ek1ePFp-nBI,twitch.tv/thcesar_420
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bueno. üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"michael myers is the only movie character to have me shook, i remember watching haloween when i was around 13 late at night in my room and wouldnt dare go to the kitchen for a drink incase he was there"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit I'm so scared
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is anyone else thinking of the Baby Driver scenewith the wrong masks?

Bats: ""What is this mask?""
JD: ""Austin Powers.""
Eddie: ""I said Michael Myers!""
JD: ""This IS Mike Myers!
Bats: ""It should be the ""Halloween"" mask!""
JD: ""This is a Halloween mask!""
Bats: ""No, the killer dude from ""Halloween!""
JD: Oh, you mean Jason.
Eddie¬†,¬†Bats: ""NO!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't get people saying this film looks too bright I don't see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,......I thought lorie strode fell to her death???
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this Halloween is going to be litüî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What i don't get is, Michael isn't a mutant like Jason Voorhees, how does he survive things like getting shot and things like that. He has no powers to allow him to survive."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Some stuff should be kept in the past
ek1ePFp-nBI,*horrible celebration begins*
ek1ePFp-nBI,they may actually kill him for good.this time
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Micheal Myers Beat Goes Hard
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm hyped.
ek1ePFp-nBI,But Michael didn‚Äôt get subdued by the police in the first one
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm getting an Aliens vibe to this in that Lori is trying to convince people how dangerous Michael is like Ripley tried to convince people how dangerous the aliens are (and no one believes them and all @$&@ breaks loose). We may FINALLY have a Halloween sequel worthy of the original...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just like paranormal activity
ek1ePFp-nBI,But didn't she didn't she die already I've seen all the Halloween movies and there all like a puzzle
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish they could do this with Star Wars: The Last Jedi!¬† Just wipe it out of existence!
ek1ePFp-nBI,BITCHHHH üò≠my god damn favorite movie üíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Report CocoBrob on Xbox
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is one of the most badass horror villians
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, I'm so excited! This looks bad ass. I'm counting down the days. I hope it's a hit. Specially commercially."
ek1ePFp-nBI,#Slasherverse is coming
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just to clear things up for people. The only movies that will now connect with each other as apart of the main story are Halloween (1978) and Halloween (2018). No Brother-Sister relation.

 Halloween 2 (1981), Halloween 4 (1988) , Halloween 5 (1989) , Halloween 6 (1995) , Halloween: H20 (1998) and Halloween: Resurrection (2002) all belong in their own alternate universe. A timeline of events deleted from the big picture where both Michel and Laurie ARE related. 


and then of course we have Halloween (2007) and Halloween II (2009) which again belongs in its own world separate from the other 2."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let's just say that Myers was 18 at the time of Halloween, he'd be close to 60 years old in this movie.  Hard to imagine a killing machine at 60 years old, especially if he spent the majority of his time in seclusion and not allowed to work out.

He'd be a shell of himself."
ek1ePFp-nBI,After 40 years they still have not demolished or fix Myers house amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've waited for him
*Gunshots*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another fucking one
ek1ePFp-nBI,T
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should we tell them it‚Äôs summer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Actually looked suspenseful.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The movie is going to be released October 19th not in juneüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Alternate ending to the scene at the end


""Can you close the closet door?""

Hits it 3 times.

*opens*

sees guy 

*SLAM* 








and that is where the teeth are from at 1:44"
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks great!
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:43 Haluk Bilginerüòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,My friend craig lemmons plays the Michael's phychiastrist in this. He said they ignore all of the other halloween movies. That this one will be halloween 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What's confusing me is them saying it's going to be the ""sequel"" to the original 1978 Halloween film. They stated, Michael & Laurie will NOT be siblings/brother & sister in this film... which is weird to me. In the original film he killed his older sister (& her boyfriend I believe) & that was it, went into the ""hospital"", came out & immediately started looking for, Laurie trying to kill her. Why? Was she just randomly in the house when his killing was going on? Was she his adopted sister? (therefore proving my point).... it just doesn't make since to me--it doesn't connect üòï. Therefore what was his actual motive in the original leading to this so-called ""sequel""?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great because Michael Myers was kept away from the big screen for too long already
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Been a fan, and scared shitless, since the first one. Cant wait to see this!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Vale se viene lo bueno
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have a feeling that this moving is going to be awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,that chick should be in an old age home. Not chasing around some murderer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie Strode has turned into Sarah Connor ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Most iconic music ever!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What if Michael vs jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Yesssss finally*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Meyer looks sick
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well it looks way better than that shit Zombie made. That was a train wreck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Like the 74452nd movie right??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks weak.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween was the first horror movie that I actually was terrified of walking down the street alone. I really hope this doesn't disappoint

Halloween was the first horror movie that I actually was terrified of walking down the street alone. I really hope this doesn't disappoint"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They should have named the movie ""Michael Myers the second Chapter"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny Mcbrides in this?  Holy shit lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit dude
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm kind of enjoying the parallel between Laurie Strode having almost the same mentality and mannerisms that Dr. Loomis had in the original film. Also rob zombie isn‚Äôt anywhere near this film and that makes me so happy
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASSSSSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hear a lot of people complain about hack directors who rely on jump scares and over-the-top violence and gore. This movie, on the other hand, looks like some folks made a genuine attempt to make something creepy and spooky. I may not see it in a theater, but I'll see it at some point."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hahaa fuckin' hell I can't wait! bloody incredible.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The knife needs to be bigger
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully it‚Äôs not a movie full of unnecessary gore like the two rob zombie movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many cocksucking remakes of this movie are there now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I heard in this one Laurie and Michael is not related at all... but they are obviously going to ignore the other sequels :p

ek1ePFp-nBI,"IF THIS IS A H20 SEQUAL THEN HOW? 
MICHAEL WAS DECAPITATED BY HER WITH AN AXE"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don‚Äôt like this idea, Michael did not get caught after Halloween he went to the hospital and carried on! They‚Äôve also had to clean his name from probably like a hundred kills to just 3"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:18
9 Damage... 9 Damage... 9 Damage"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope that it's good so I guess that the other movies don't count cause this is 40 years after part 1 and in this he got locked up right after Loomis shot him and is that jaime strode Laurie's daughter and what about her son Josh
ek1ePFp-nBI,The same superneonzoondweebies that get excited over this.. also watch the walking dead.. boring lives..

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael we‚Äôre back üéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Spooky
ek1ePFp-nBI,hopefully this will be good if John Carpenter made. What the F*ck is up with these British actors in movies these days with there accents like in Star Wars get them √¥tta her√©üò£

Now I'm just waiting for the Aquaman trailer to be released."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"why stand in the stall if some creep tries to get in there? i would've been crawled under the stalls and ran away even before he dropped the teeth, this is why i can't see horror movies in the theater i just scream at the actors."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why would it have the same name as the original J.L.C. version,wouldn't that confuse things,since it stars the same Laurie Strode?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where's Busta Rhymes?

ek1ePFp-nBI,The face at 1:49. I guess he is michael myers but who is the one behind the mask?

ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope they can have the remake actually good instead of adding a bunch of jumpscares to make the movie seem like its scary!
ek1ePFp-nBI,that Michael Myers mask is terrifying
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laury Myers is bringing the me too movement with her to stop Michael Myers.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:45 - 1:47 
Girl:  trick or treat 
Killer:  I got you"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing! For a split second I thought it was Carol from walking dead
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here's why them ignoring the brother/sister angle seems like a gimmick until the film arrives; In the original film, she knew nothing about him, not even his name, now, 40 years later, she knows his name and states that she waited for him, and that he's coming for her? Michael (In the original film), only stalked people associated with Laurie, so yeah, played for hype that they're not related in any way."
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 I'm finally ready to come out of the closet!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where‚Äôs a pallet when you need it

ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse knocked this franchise out of the park rumor has it that that is a sequel already written dependent out of this does at the box office if the trailer is to represent this movie this movie is going to redefine the whole Halloween franchise love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,number 1 on trend must be good

ek1ePFp-nBI,All that gun training and you swing a knife for him to grab your wrist. Yea ok! Where was your strap! I‚Äôll wait til it come out on Netflix
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully this will be better then the other two remakes cuz those sucked compared to the original ones ... So far it looks decent & if Jamie Lee Curtis is in it gotta be worth watching facts ... guess will have to wait & seeüéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,*HYPE*
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's that stupid fucking shit they do now at the beginning of the trailer that's like a teaser of the tr ailer stop it it's annoying and takes away the suspense
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet that reporter guy is gonna end up being a killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,*after the trailer .. play a round Dead by Daylight!!* :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:08 pause it on the left side of the screen look into that other room with the blue lighting it seems as if their is someone their , seems like it could possibly the same room wer we see some one with a white blanket over their head sitting in a chair, second killer?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck me
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this is legit, then why is Jamie Lee Curtis in this?? She was killed off in Halloween Resurrection So her character shouldn't be in this film... First 2 Halloween films were pretty reasonable, Halloween 3: Seaon of the witch onwards are shit. Let's not forget the 2 terrible rob zombie remakes which absoulty bored the living hell out of me.. Remakes are shit & shouldn't be done. But that's Americans for ya they've actually ran out of ideas for movies which is why they do remakes & follow-ons to movies etc. & do shit english versions of foreign movies which I absolutely hate. Fucking Americans don't know how to make movies.... American films & T.V. series I NEVER watch..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is one of those movies that EVERYONE is going to see. Young and old, all people who loved the original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ahm! This is 2018, shouldn't Michael Myers be female?!!?

This is a joke btw"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So everyone is going to act like Jason should be around 80 something years old, suffering from dementia and in a nursing home...I'm Just saying."
ek1ePFp-nBI,awesome üëçüëçüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,If laury is old than shouldn't michael be way to old to be a threat to anyone? I'm confused by their ages lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ANYONE.. so, who was the little baby in the Myers home the night he killed his sister Judith? The baby in the crib never got mentioned again & that's why it made since itd be Laurie; but now, Laurie ain't his sister, so who was the baby in the crib??"
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIEüî•ü§§
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm going to look at the first Halloween movie right now  üòàüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So let me get this straight: Michael escapes an institution, kills some folks in a gas station, puts on the iconic white mask and blue coveralls, returns to town on Halloween, and stalks babysitters? And what exactly is the part of this plot that is original and groundbreaking?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers and Jason used to keep me up at night
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait is this a reboot?.....or part 2 40 years later after the first?...I'm confused......does that mean all the other ones never happened
ek1ePFp-nBI,W H A T T H E F U C K
ek1ePFp-nBI,it looks good... but im going to need some horror geeks to explain to me about him getting his head cut off the last movie with jamie lee curtis then in this one it appears hes been locked up in another mental institution...smndh..

ek1ePFp-nBI,If I watch this I'm gonna shit myself
ek1ePFp-nBI,At least Blumhouse has it now. It's in good hands. They know and respect horror. Like no other major Hollywood studio. Let's see how it goes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Michael killed his sister? How is she alive playing the same character?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Another one, really...  Shit is getting old already."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's with the drab color? Not to mention the neo70's clothes the kids have on.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Welcome Back Jamie!! "" üéâüéäüëèüéâüéä"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The scariest part of this is when he bumps into the kids and they don‚Äôt even know who he is because he could just be someone being him for Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Welcome Back Jamie!!!"" Congratsüëèüéâüéäüéâüéä"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween part 2 was actually pretty good one of the best sequels out of the franchise's!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooo how old is Michael Myers in this one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Unbelievebble !!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a return of halloween that isn't a disaster made by Rob Zombie.

OMG"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I still wished they had her son come back because H20 was a good sequel. And If they wanted her to have a daughter, they should of bought Jamie her daughter from 4 and 5 back. Would of made more sense then to keep making up children of hers..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!!! Another Halloween Movie!!!!!! I can‚Äôt Wait!!!!! üòä
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yall should subscribe to my channel , Subscribing back to everyone who comments done below !!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What would be nice would be, in my opinion, Michael Myers vs Freddy Krueger - the former knows no fear -  he is actually fear and evil himself - and the latter plays with the fears of others to trap and kill them. And I prefer Michael over Jason by the way.  What makes Michael truly terrifying according to me is that he is able to think, to make up strategies to escape and trap his victims, while Jason just .... well you know ...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It just feels like more action then horror
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks AMAZING!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie is shook.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks Creepy. But not so Creepy that it's impossible to watch.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How did Michael Myers reattached his head after Jamie Lee Curtis chopped it off in the last movie ?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,Think Michael has a tooth fetish
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's coming for millennials
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't like how they're portraying Michael in this film , in the original classic Halloween movie he had some morals , I remember a scene where some kid bumped into him and he didn't kill the kid he let him go , I'm affraid that this movie might turn Michael into a clich√© Terminator/ Jason Vorhees type of
 character who murders everyone ."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Take our money
ek1ePFp-nBI,So what exactly is his deal? Does he only kill his family or like what? I‚Äôve never seen it so can someone explain
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After rewatching the original,  I hope they bring back michaels heavy breathing. That made the movie creepier"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:20

ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm in
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't get this so what happens to Halloween to Halloween resurrection dident happen then please if going to try reboot a movie at lest follow the storie set out already insted of totally changing it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie died in resaurection
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Excuse you Michael, there was somebody in that fucking stall"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks pretty good for a horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,im fucking geeked
ek1ePFp-nBI,Unboxing from NIKE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTlRnKT_zzo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good but it's doesn't this movie make the other Halloweens unimportant? Didn't she die in the previous one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait I bet this movie will be great
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/ySZosDQCDmk
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm scared, but not for the right reasons"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can we make new movies please
ek1ePFp-nBI,is it just me or does the soundtrack at the end sound like something from black ops 3 zombies ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got chills at 1:56 when the theme song came on
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt she kill him in Halloween H20!? If I‚Äôm not mistaken she decapitated himüòÖ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mmm......well i guess then after H20 they glued his head back on and sent him on his way to kill some more. smh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,ohhh yeahhh there will be blood ! ! ! !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Imagine just being in the closet and getting hit by the door many times
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh shit this Halloween there are going to be a lot of people with that mask , let's hope that it doesn't inspired those kids that make school shooting to do more"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer alone scared the shit out of me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,How come the latest holloween films all turn out to be good but they can figure out how to recreate Freddy??? üòíüòíüòí

ek1ePFp-nBI,Why the fuck would he show him the mask in the first place?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You can't just cancel out the other movies as if they never happened. A completely shitty move. Doing this makes Michael seem less scary then he really is. Only killing ""4"" people doesn't make him a serial killer"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see it I love Micheal Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,One & done. Let it go.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ilove this dude yesss

ek1ePFp-nBI,"It looks kinda good i guess
but i just wanna see it for my man's Michael"
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy hell, this looks AMAZING!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,But Lorrie dies in Halloween Resurrection? He stabs her and she falls off a roof. How is she still alive or have they made some weird alternate timeline
ek1ePFp-nBI,The mask looks like shit.  Not watching
ek1ePFp-nBI,I had to wait 1:52 for the song to kick in ..... Worth IT !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,watch movie now https://bit.ly/2Jy94Yv
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please let it be better then rob zombies version please. Cause he butchered halloween. Which is why i stick with the originals.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Shoooook this better be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My only complaint about this: Laurie should DEFINITELY have a bigger gun lol. Like a 12 gauge shotgun, maybe even a 10 gauge shotgun. Other than than that....HELL YEAH!! TOTALLY STOKED FOR THIS!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Her suppressed pistol was too loud
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks fan made
ek1ePFp-nBI,Boring...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Waht thE hlel si tihs, hepolfuly ti deosnt daispopnit"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got shivers down my spinw when the theme song played
ek1ePFp-nBI,I remember watching this in the 80s and 90s
ek1ePFp-nBI,üêê
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can not wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Black cats and broomsticks and goblins and ghosts, 
Covens of witches with all of their hosts, 
You may think they scare me, you're probably right, 
Black cats and goblins on Halloween night...

ek1ePFp-nBI,hey i just posted a new cover and it‚Äôll be awesome if you can check it out!! üíóüíó

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cool, Rob Zombie isn‚Äôt here to ruin this one."

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is your daily reminder that we are under total fascist control!
ek1ePFp-nBI,the bullshit man is here
ek1ePFp-nBI,I won‚Äôt see this movie unless I find out he kills her
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I could not be more excited about this!! Halloween is one of my favorite horror franchises!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks fricking amazing!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why don't they call it H3O so people avoid it and the franchise can die with what little dignity it has left?
ek1ePFp-nBI,*june's started a while ago and now's the time to make a halloween movie?*
ek1ePFp-nBI,My concern is halloween 4 Laurie had a daughter but in halloween resurrection she had a son but she never mentioned about her having a daughter first.
ek1ePFp-nBI,micheal Myers never dies because he is pure evil
ek1ePFp-nBI,Takes off mask* ‚Äúit‚Äôs me baby mike Myers aka Austin powers‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks unbelievably stupid. cant we get some originality back in this bitch?? do we disregard every movie that took place after the original now? and just pretend all the other ones never happened? unbelievable stupid.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing!

ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here we go again. Every time a new Halloween movie attempts to explain a reason why Michael Myers is who he is, or tries to give some humanity to his character it hurts the film entirely. Some things never need explaining, they just are. The simplicity of the original slasher made the film a horror masterpiece. Even the original Halloween II maintained the same feel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg yassss...that lit song though
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie's are better but the best are 1 and 2 the originals

ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks good! Feels like going back to the roots. What Halloween really was. The remake and second movie by Rob Zombie was horrible. Now so glad that they had worked with the Halloween master itself (John Carpenter) together on the new movie. Can‚Äòt wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay but the closer scene was funny. I mean he just stood there while getting a door slammed on his face
ek1ePFp-nBI,i sharted hard bruh
ek1ePFp-nBI,00:57 You know your culture made it in America when a white chick casually drinks boba tea while walking down the street in a horror movie trailer.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"It does look great. But, if they are not related in this continuity, then why would he go after her? I have a hard time believing it would just be because she didn't die in the first one. He should have no emotional connection to her.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I understand the decision to erase previous installments in the franchise excluding the original film, however I don‚Äôt get why they had to also do away with Halloween II (1981). I also don‚Äôt like how in this film it‚Äôs established that Myers was captured that same night he was shot, when in the original film, his body mysteriously disappears, which made for the most quintessential, terrifying ending. I just don‚Äôt understand Hollywood these days."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"""The bus crashed"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis looks so fucking old
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok I‚Äôm really impressed by this Trailer!


Hyped for this movie big Halloween fan here!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,could‚Äôve swore he killed laurie in resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,So dose this take place 40 years after the original Halloween and Halloween 2 or just the 1st one since Michael was set on fire
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The hollywood hypocrisy continues. Big leftist, anti gun liberal actress, Jamie Lee Curtis seen in this movie using a gun, a powerful rifle at that, to defend herself and her family from an indestructible lunatic killer. Does anyone else hate their hypocrisy? if guns are useless against bad guys, and should not be owned by private citizens, why do Hollywood and left wing actors like Curtis, use them in their movies to stop the bad guys and defend themselves?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music in this is very similar to the bo2 zombies menu music
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought it‚Äôs Mickey Rourke
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mann I been waiting on this!! üëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think Michael is real because October Friday the 13th 2017 nothing was working at my school
ek1ePFp-nBI,Put this back on number 1 for trending
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please. No Rob Zombie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael looks so sad in the thumbnail.  :(  I hope he's feeling okay.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why would you bring the mask back to him? You know he is a serial killer and will just kill again. Why you encouraging him? You all know everybody gonna die the moment The other inmates  started freaking out too. They know what‚Äôs up.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If somebody don‚Äôt put a .50 cal in his ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know who Michael is its Michael Rosen dududuuu
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good but hoping they don't fuck it up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that Madelaine Petsch at 2:03 ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Alot of people are fooled.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn cant wait for the new halloween. Lauri coming back. I thought the original Michael Myers  was dead guess I was wrong. Love the first Halloween 1978.
ek1ePFp-nBI,More garbage from Hollyweird
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My teacher's name is Michael Meyer no ""S"" tho"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've waited for him, too."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I haven't watched any of them.
Is it worth watching?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,reminds me of call of duty ghosts :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a a fresh Halloween movie but hopefully the last
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to make a movie about a copy cat Michael Myers serial killer in a way more relistick obsession with the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://m.soundcloud.com/savage_gxds/sxuce
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôll kill Michael Myers myself.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should‚Äôve got released on halloweenüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,*I ain't going to watch this shit*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please release this in India on October 19 too.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57 Sounds like the Jurassic Park theme.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jurrasic world?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Actually looks well. Didn't show much in the trailer hope it stays that way

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have a question. In Halloween Resurrection, Laurie Strode fell and landed on the ground and I thought she died. How did she recover?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!!!! There has been nothing but stupid (non) scary movies over the years!! This is what you call a horror movie!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Spoiler alert






The British guy dies seeing as his corpse was used to break the door to the toilet open"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is random but you know when you make a weird/scary noise and you‚Äôre not sure if you made the noise so you try make it again and if you don‚Äôt make the exact same noise you know there‚Äôs a demon in your house?
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELLOween.‚òï
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've waited for Jamie Lee to return OMG THIS LOOKS AMAZING !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter at least we know it's not going to suck like Rob Zombie's did but there's one question I have Jamie Lee Curtis AKA Laurie strode's got killed and Halloween resurrection by Michael here's the question I have does it take after part 2 when she's in the hospital or they going to make it where she survived that fall and Resurrection that's what I don't understand so this going to be part 3 instead of seasonal which now or they're going to make it like Resurrection never happened that's a question I have but there's also another question I have from 4 from Halloween resurrection never happened so like I said is this the regional part 3 instead of season or which but this is 40 years later now I'm really happy this is coming out but there's a lot of questions I have
ek1ePFp-nBI,*wish the girl in the bathroom would of said im joe grizzly bitch. lmao*
ek1ePFp-nBI,BEST HORRIR FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!! MICHAEL MYERS IS THE MAN!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i heard this the last halloween we gonna have in a long time, but hopefully there's another movie to make it a triliogy"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm concerned because I never heard of the director doing anything good before this. Let's hope it doesn't get butchered. I'd hate to see a horror movie icon get destroyed by some inept director or screenwriter. We've lost too many good ones already. Although Carpenter approved the script, so there is some hope."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt she die?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I dont like horror movies at all but... i fucking want to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't anyone write something new? Lazy tribesman.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm sure there's just a misunderstanding.

ek1ePFp-nBI,This motherfucker is still alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally,Later of rob zombie this needs to be cool"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will Shatner is Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I didn't mind the first, second remake of the original. The one that zombie fella with his classically trained wife. The second remake of the original sequel was awful. So I'm hoping zombo does have his hands in this movie, all that screaming and self pity was irritating. so let's hope the third remake of the first original movie will meet expectations.... again.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Only ONE black person???? What is this, 1939?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did anyone else notice the Jurassic World theme tone at 0:58?
ek1ePFp-nBI,jamie lee curtis....has aged quite a bit...yet Michael Myers is the Picture of Dorian Gray!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why would they show Michael his mask. It just brings him back to when he was killing people... Do they want him to kill other people again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fkin awesome! Legendary Curtis, and Myers together! Music and feel back to normal, that Zombie crap was terrifrugginble!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Nope
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't get it. She is like 56, and in the old movie Micheal was like 12 years older than her.......68, wow he is about 68."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Idk why but at 2:34 it just had me cracking up just thinking of the door just hitting him a bunch of times üòÇüòÇüòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wasn‚Äôt Michael decapitated in H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who els cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Isn't Michael Myers like 83 at this point...?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If he wasn't related to her, why would he go after her?  This plot just kills that mythology.  Was she the babysitter that got away?  LOL  Sounds like the plot for the Terminator."
ek1ePFp-nBI,·Éö(‡≤†Áõä‡≤†·Éö) this is a god damn action movie now god damn it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look like the thinning !!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailers these days are literally the whole movie lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG.  Same actor who played Michael in the 1978 original.  Nick Castle.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hunter rifle does 90 to the head
ek1ePFp-nBI,I will never watch this movie he is my worst nightmare ever since the first oringnal halloween movie hell nahhhhhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween was the first ever scary movie I watched I was 1yrs d ha
ek1ePFp-nBI,The theme song üî•AF
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this presumes that the whole Laurie/Michael Myers thing from Halloween Ressurection didn't happen.  Fair enough, I've tried to repress the memories of that movie as well."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie discredits all the sequels
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers... La Oscuridad!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Next video: ""How to kill Michael Myers"" 
Edit: By NowThis Nerd"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The song reminds me of black ops zombies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so pumped for this. The final Halloween. And it‚Äôs directed by carpenter.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I would just serenade him then stab him directly in the arsehole when his guard is down xxx
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Eh, did we really need this?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow....
ek1ePFp-nBI,I never watched these movies but I will watch this one. think...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Right so I know this is picking up after the 1st one but how does this work with the ending to 1? His body disappears at the end of it and then he goes to the same night in the 2nd one. Is it maybe continuing on from that night opposed to just the first film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,FSK..?
ek1ePFp-nBI,WAIT WAIT ANSWER ASAP IS THAT MICHEAL 0:39
ek1ePFp-nBI,does anyone know the age rating on this? 15 or 18?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks ok. Except for the part where Michael would be like 60 years old after escaping prison.  There aren't too many 60 year olds with good cardio out there;)
ek1ePFp-nBI,William Shatner looks great.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like complete shit, poor editing"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hollywood is so original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want Jamie Lee Curtis to be 99 years old still appearing in this trilogy okay üëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If Michael can get a new movie, how bout hooking my dudes Jason and chucky up? (And ik they made cult of chucky but that one sucked)"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs just keep paying to see the same movie from a different victims point of view... seems legit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm just thinking maybe Michael infected the other prisoners mentality, making them think like Michael."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:31 
I had the same problem, but luckily it was my shoe playing games."
ek1ePFp-nBI,He should be a guest character in Mortal Kombat 11. Dont make any more movies though.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait wtf???????
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:30 the monster is hiding in the closet? REAL ORIGINAL
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for the movie but shouldn't she be scared instead of wanting him to escape? After all that went down in 1978 she wants him to return? Doesn't really make sense to me
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Taken into custody that night"".................WHAT?!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"They should stop with this franchise unless they're gonna do something unique and sensible like a film on what he really is, how he got his powers, etc. Because it's the only thing left. Rob Zombie showed us the younger side of Michael as he became psychotic but clearly he's more than just a tough lunatic. Did he make a pact with the devil? Was he possessed?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can we maybe get a NEW VILLAIN!? Fred Krueger, Chucky, Mike Myers. Leatherface, Jason Vorhees? These cats have been on the screen since the late 70s. Like Metallica, they were once shocking and new, but now have the potency and recognition of dawn dish soap. It's in every home in the world. We see it everyday and have become absolutely desensitized to it. Hollywood needs originals, not imitators.  In the words of Ace Frehley, "" Shock Me""."

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks terrible

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please let this film have a rest..If i wanted to watch the original,I would simply put in a 1978 BETAMAX tape and be happy..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wowüòå
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is gonna just erase the original halloween 2 from ever happening? Always considered halloween 2 as a great sequel and always watched them back to back. That kinda sucks imo.
ek1ePFp-nBI,good one 8-)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey, Universal, put a #9 or a subtitle on the film title. This is a sequel. We already have one too many films simply titled ""Halloween."" Don't muddy the waters further by giving us a third."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"They still don't explain how he's still alive and well after being blown up and COMPLETELY engulfed in flames and doesn't seem to have a mark on him, and his original mask was DEFINITELY destroyed in the explosion and subsequent fire, bringing him back this time will be just as stupid and boring as any of the other myriad times he's been brought back."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn that bathroom scene got me fucked up
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can someone tell me why Michael was laughing in that scene where the guy showed him the mask? That's not Michael Myers like at all. That reminded me of Freddy Kruegar. Michael Myers is pure evil. He does not laugh. He does not smile. All he does is walk, and kill. Walk and kill. 

Why ruin it? Also why even show us his face? They never showed us his face in the original movies besides one shot in the first film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well now I know what to say when I'm using the stall
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was this supposed to be scary?
ek1ePFp-nBI,AWESOME
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel bad for the kid at 2:31 cause he was just tryna watch some Thomas the train man

ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 whose face is that??
ek1ePFp-nBI,I grew up on these movies. This will be more scarier than the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Jamie Lee Curtis isn't in a Halloween movie -- then it's NOT a Halloween movie !! !!  I can't wait for this to come out !!! HUGE FAN since I was 10 ....
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's wrong with Rob Zombie movies ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"From 0:50 to 0:59, am I the only one who thinks the melody sounds like de Jurassic Park theme?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have a theory about the Halloween franchise going forward... With the recent popularity of  shared universes in movie franchises and the anthology format with American Horror story, what if this sequel also acts as a soft reboot to the the original concept behind the start of the Halloween franchise. The REAL Halloween franchise we never got. 

Before this sounds too irrational, Blumhouse is producing this and I wouldn't be suprised if they were currently trying to come up with a countermove to rival the domination that Atomic monster (The James Wan company behind The conjuring shared universe) has over the horror genre as of late. If so, then what better way is there to do that, now that they have the Halloween rights as well as people passionate about the story in control.

So this is where connected franchises tie in, obviously we all know Halloween was meant to be an anthology, but it wouldn't be too hard to wrap that idea with a snug shared universe bow. They're bankable, more entertaining, and The conjuring is proof that it works. So who knows, they're probably planning the anthology shared universe Halloween series with this as a bridge, acting as a secret reboot to start the new series and a sequel that closes the old convoluted story they started but never got to finish so very long ago. It would be an honest, downright quick and easy way to make a huge horror franchise successful. Well, successful AGAIN. Anyway the chances are slim, but if blumhouse knew what they were doing, this would be genius. 

Plus this way we would get so many original, great modern horror movies from not only The conjuring, but Halloween. Michael myers could make cameos or at the very least easter eggs, and they could always bring him back for however many sequels. It could be like how The conjuring series still continues the story of the Warren's in between all of their spinoffs. It's like a hybrid combination of an anthology and shared universe. Once again this is just a dream of mine lol sadly I doubt it'll happen, but I had to share the idea of it. It'd be so perfect, and exactly what we need right now.

Also I forgot to add this in my comment, but the fact that the movie is titled just ""Halloween"" is one of the biggest reasons I think this movie is a soft reboot. It could've been Halloween 2, or Halloween with a subtitle, but they chose Halloween."

ek1ePFp-nBI,HYPED
ek1ePFp-nBI,"for the love of god stop naming it after the original add a subtitle like ""the return"" ""the final hour"" or something I don't care what, just stop confusing the shit outta people."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well that was scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:54 LETS GO!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Michael Mayer doesn‚Äôt die in the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 2 is the best - no Mikey fuckin Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How did you turn president street into Hatfield
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's the scariest 60 year old ever.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nc!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original scream queen is back bitches
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 when that beat drop
ek1ePFp-nBI,Check out my first video on my channel!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I grew up watching these every Halloween and I'm so fucking excited for this one to come out!!! üëèüèΩüòä
ek1ePFp-nBI,NOW TRY NOT TO LAUGH AT THIS https://youtu.be/SO6_HZNVghU I WANTO TRY THE RAINBOW
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this one ignores Halloween 2 completely since the brother connection is gone which was in 2 and clearly at the end of 2 Micheal and Loomis dies. Halloween 2 (1981 version not the Rob Zombie one) was produced by Carpenter and Debra Hill who did the original 1978 film. Kinda funny how it ignores that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was i the only one who thought that was funny and not scary üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is a typical horror movie no offence and the only horror movie i  watched were Friday the 13th with my friends it was jokes and IT 2017 which as a whole was an amazing movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So does this come after Halloween or Halloween 2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks great, but I strongly dislike that they disregarded the other ones, except for retreating and H20. How do you forget that Laurie had a son named John? Or a daughter named Jamie?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice to see John Carpenter and JLC back. I love the first two films. I also like Robs spin on this movie as well...
ek1ePFp-nBI,We found the real Micheal
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 EPIC!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YEAH!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do they ever show his real face
ek1ePFp-nBI,I get the same way when someone pulls something white out of their pants
ek1ePFp-nBI,You guys remember when they use to make good movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh yeah!! Can't wait...That's what we talkin bout...don't get any better than those classics! Oops..I mean don't get any 'badder' Lol!! Muhuuhahaha =)  Gulp =\
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yess.  Thank u god looks like they didnt fuk it upüòÜ

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wot?
Edit: Fuck it i'm in"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes yes yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh u got scared just watching the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,I fell asleep when I pressed play
ek1ePFp-nBI,can‚Äôt wait for the 486th installment next year ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that the Leatherface from Mortal Kombat X ??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, this actually seems like it could be competant"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they finally kill him this time
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/WYMrKv5KbZk this is amazing funny video
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm going to make sure of my closet door after this 2:36
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cropper time
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck ya!!!
Michael is the shit!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hype-oween
ek1ePFp-nBI,my fav killer in Horror movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs wrappsssss üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hmm.. seems like its story will be heavily influenced with feminist politics.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is showing complete disregard for part 2 and up. That's an interesting angle. So this is really part 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,E
ek1ePFp-nBI,Despacito
ek1ePFp-nBI,...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes! I will watch this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don‚Äôt let this be trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many of these need to be made?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"**SPOILER ALERT** on previous Halloween Movies




I thought on Halloween ""H20"" that Jamie Lee Curtis decapitated Michael Myers in the end"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many movies are their now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bro if your not  sexually frustrated after watching this trailer what‚Äôs wrong with you üòê
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Pfft, disliked. He‚Äôs forgetting his hockeymask"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's time to stop!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt Laurie decapitate Michael at the end of Halloween H20? Pretty sure she already killed him. Jamie Lee Curtis‚Äô career hasn‚Äôt been that bad lately surely.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good now dont fuck it up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie is punching at the air mad asf right now
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers is getting way too old for this.  These should have stopped many moons ago.  All the remakes, reboots, there is just too many.  Let the classics stake their claim without always having to rehash them!  These started out when I was a baby, and that was a damn long time ago.  I did like Rob Zombies first interpretation though.  It was really raw and gut wrenching.  ..but yeah, I will see this one too, just like all the others...even though"
ek1ePFp-nBI,we are here to invest tigate
ek1ePFp-nBI,When will Hollywood stop recycling old movies and actually come up with original ideas? Isn't it about time they kill this guy for sure?...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dont let this distract you from the fact that Freddie vs Jason never got a sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got goosebumps when the dog lost it cause of Michael's mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back!? :o
ek1ePFp-nBI,So does this ignore all the other sequels?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting awhile for this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is gay at 2:30 he comes out of the closet.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,i was the 7777777 watcher
ek1ePFp-nBI,It wasn't scary in the 70's either.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It'd be better of it came out on Halloween instead of 1 week earlier. Opinions
ek1ePFp-nBI,can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jeeeeez my mans moving like the tooth fairy 1:45
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie where you at? It ain't HALLOWEEN with out U :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how they ignoring all of the sequels after Halloween 2 (1981) can‚Äôt wait for this!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,They actually brought back jamie lee curtis... holy shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes. Just *YES*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nah brah nah fo real? I'm STOKED
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No offense, but if a crazy murderer was coming after me I'd get my family on a plane out of the country. Maybe I'd stay behind to face him, but get the kids out!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,2 spooky for me
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm sorry I love the  Holloween movies but there is too much remade and destroyed, nothing is going to make it rise u. There is just  to much damage done and can never be fixed"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy Shit!!!! Who's EXCITED!!üôãüôã
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit is creepy as hell
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I dont get it, did not Michael's sister died in halloween resurrection?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üí§
ek1ePFp-nBI,AGAIN?~! Milking the name of this franchise for all its might eh?
ek1ePFp-nBI,hollywood has lost its creativity.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm confused...is this a reboot or a sequel?? ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks fucking stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Shit will be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,N o t    s c a r y
ek1ePFp-nBI,So happy for this!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"when the music started playing i was like ""YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!"""

ek1ePFp-nBI,Whart
ek1ePFp-nBI,Krasssü§êü§ê
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope that Musty Mike kills that kid in the baby sitter scene. It‚Äôs always great when a movie goes there y‚Äôknow?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"üéÉ Awesome trailer. Finally a horror movie I'll go see first day in years.  I knew john carpenter would come back and help produce with writers and director and show the people how's it's really done.  Rob zombie needs to watch take notes and just focus on his music and dig through the ditches. And his 1000 corpse 
And leave carpenters creation alone.!!!! üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cannot fucking WAIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,She needs to call John Wick
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Beast can‚Äôt wait to seee it, anyone is sandiego or Los angels wants to go see it ?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this technically following thecurrent  trend and this is old Man Michael? I wonder if he had a beard underneath too
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else find it strange that this is supposed to be the direct sequel to the first Halloween and it's also called Halloween. Still pumped for this movie tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This shit, should have come out in halloween not in friggin summer!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hello,  911 emergency, there‚Äôs a handsome guy in my house.  Oh, Heh, wait a second, cancel that, it‚Äôs only me. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjyieo-ilopqxKt-aLwhnHw"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This series will never finish like one last ride üòù
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Mm yes let's continue the dark universe, it started out so well!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm happy to see Jamie Lee Curtis is back looks good just like Halloween h20 what is my favourite one
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm glad I have a messy closet. Clutter saves lives üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,He forgot to put the teeth under his pillow
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt waittttttttüòùüò≥.
ek1ePFp-nBI,They're making another one of these things?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else get a Texas Chainsaw vibe from this trailer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis back!! Yeees!! Why did you let him out? To kill him.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,That's what I was looking for
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lorie Strode died in the resurrection one,but maybe she cheated death,but now she's back"
ek1ePFp-nBI,We boutta get litt üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee Curtis should be the one wearing a mask.. Jeesus!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who's is so excited for this!?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dat good ol halloween theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,Time to binge the movies now
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a how to movie? How to kill a murder.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*O O F*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie died in resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/XAKWY5q7WhA
ek1ePFp-nBI,Made by Blum house I know it‚Äôs good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"why is Lauri back on here, I thought she got killed at the beginning of Halloween Resurrection"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 This shit still creeps me out... üòß
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this commes after Halloween resuraction or?
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES. YES. YES. YES.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What can the franchise gain from one more money grabbing shitty product.ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is sooooooo stupid.  After soooo many halloween sequels where does this one take us?!  I think Jaime Lee Curtis just needs more money thats all.  This franchise is played out and tired just like Friday 13th, Nightmare on Elmstreet, etc.  I'm not interested until its on for free on the Roku Channel or something.  I want to see King Kong vs. Godzilla in 2020!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They have the original cast from the first John Carpenter film from 40 years ago

Jamie Lee Curtis is 59 and Nick Castle is 70 going on 71"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What‚Äôs the certificate
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best horror movie growing up.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are you kidding? As if we needed another one of these.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I dont watch this movie because i want to buy the skull trooper,the ghoul trooper, and the ReaperüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt Jamie Lee Curtis got thrown off a building in the last two?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Welcome back brother, its been a long long time. We've all missed you."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought  this gonna be another shitty remake but i'm suprised. This looked refreshing and creative. Only the trailer reveals too much. Cheers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nigga been trying to kill his sister forever just let it go
ek1ePFp-nBI,what the fuck kind of prison is that
ek1ePFp-nBI,I HOPE SHE KICKS HIS ASS AND NOT LET HIM ESCAPE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If Jamie lee is In it than I approve, they need to up gore factor, zombie stepped it up and stuck true to the rules."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Rob zombie ones were best overall    
So I was little disappointed when it did not have him directing I have been a fan since the beginning so seeing Jamie Lee Curtis in the trailer  was kinda cool"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Definitely taking some young chicken head to go see this with me. Scary movies equal cuddles & toppy. üíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,When they are at the asylum and he addresses Michael; the way it's filmed makes it look like he is talking to the dog.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a decent horror movie after years!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit is about to get real ...oohhhh danm yes can‚Äôt wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,b v s : do you bleed ..... you will üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,So...where and how does this one fit into the series timeline? Did everything from Halloween 2 to Halloween Ressurection never happen in this timeline?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This seems worse than the last one, how many times do you want to retell the story"
ek1ePFp-nBI,X
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:01 *Pumpgun* xD
ek1ePFp-nBI,My childhood revived üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:30 üëéüëéüëéüëé
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lauri Strode officially DIED in H2O. Fuck this bullshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,So every movie from Halloween 2 all the way to Ressurection never happened. As a horror fan I'm still going to see this movie. But it just feels lazy to shit on an entire franchise
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fatty magoo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don‚Äôt get how he still alive he is like Jason? Lol I never understood.
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTFüò≤
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween - Geriatric Michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rip
ek1ePFp-nBI,After Rob Zombies work on this film you can‚Äôt really live up the hype even grabbing Jamie Lee.  Look at how stiff Michael looks with that slow arm raise.  Robs Michael would stand there and stare at you while you panicked just to like grab you and chokeslam you onto a stair corner and shit.  I won‚Äôt lie though it looks interesting.  Guess I‚Äôll wait until I see this to compare.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is there a 5 second preview of the preview before the preview? Senseless.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so happy Jamie Lee Curtis is in the new Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How many Halloween 1's do we need?! And, yes, I'll be the first one in line to see it cause it looks amazing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear they only make remakes/sequels of movies these days... but I ain‚Äôt complaining haha
ek1ePFp-nBI,Booooooo Halloween sucks
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gaaaaaaay!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how scary movies from back then come out with a new version of that movie with some one tryna kill that momster or murder to save everyone like chucky
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh no another halloween movie. There are like 20 of these already. They should have stopped before ressurecution
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael < Jason ! Michael win 50% ! Jason Jason Jason üòòüòòüòò !
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome cant wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too early tbh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do they really have to call it Halloween? I'm so sick and tired of Hollywood being so uncreative that two or more movies in a franchise have the SAME EXACT TITLE. Sigh...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok so no ones talking about how the first trailer for Halloween was 2:45 and so was this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have a weird feeling that the lil black kid gon get killed for no reasonüíÄüíÄüíÄ that's some bullshit if it happen
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Michael is ok after the bus crash and gets a claim inüëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,Acting level... 100%
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how he don‚Äôt hurt the kids
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woiii to that old lady still <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,spooky.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm really excited for this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dayummmmmmm
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought he disappeared in the og Halloween after he was shot. I mean was he just around the corner bleeding out then üòÇ? Might still give it a watch tho, cause it looks a thousand times better than anything since atleast H20 and I see a lot of easter eggs and references to the others."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol at the end he got his toe stubbed by the closet door like 5 times in a row.. No wonder hes pissed
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only thing I don't quite understand, is why they let that man stroll into a maximum security mental home for the criminally insane and trigger Michael like that xD but I'm sure it will make sense the story unfolds. Omg I can't wait!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can somebody tell me how many Michael Myers spin-offs are there?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait! This will be a BLAST! A+++++++++++++
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57 totally ripped of the Jurassic Park theme...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"NO! NO! NO! I hate when Hollywood ruins my childhood with these remakes! Leave the classics alone! Stop using the same storylines to make money, BE CREATIVE, isn't that what you guys do???"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait I‚Äôm so excited!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG omg omg! It it actually looks good!! I can't wait to see this! I don't expect it to live up to John Carpenters standard but I'm sure it will be much muc better than those Rob Zombie mistakes lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This stupid. If michael myers was locked all this time, then who was doing all the killing in all the other Halloween movies?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally universal thanks
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one that got scared at the end or....?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh so they're ignoring number 2 now and he's not Lauries brother 
What a load of shite"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If Michael could talk

Girl: *goes to shut closet
Micheal: crap
Girl: *goes to shut closet
Micheal: oof
Girl: *opens closet
Micheal: peek a booüòê"
ek1ePFp-nBI,TRENDING  üî•üî•üî• I hope one day my music videos can reach this many people. It‚Äôs my dreamüí´ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxt8elNjY08
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's with remaking /rebooting movies and naming them the same as the original.its annoying and it shows that corporations are so unoriginal that they can't think of a new title let alone a new concept for a movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,We've been seeing this same shit for last 40 years.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Honestly we all already know how this movie is going to go, Michael goes on an awesome killing spree, with a few jumpscares here and there and some teleporting. He kills everyone except for 1 or 3 then he ""dies"" and then his body magically dissaperes."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, not a fan made trailer"
ek1ePFp-nBI,didnt he kill lory?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how you can't see the eyes of Michael myers inside the mask. That make him less human
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2 things.
1. ""i've been waiting for him to escape.""
""Why?""
""So i could kill him.""
You cannot kill Michael Myers that's like trying to kill Jason Voorhees.
2. i Recall Michael being A lot taller than that lil piss ant that he hands the mask over to."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So if I have this clear Judy Greene plays Laurie's daughter. I wonder if her name is Jamie like Halloween 4.
Also I think this should be a sequel to H20.
I wanted the series like this
Halloween 
Halloween 2
H20
And this.
But that is not what‚Äôs happening. Still looks amazing. This is how you make Halloween Rob Zombie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finna see dis
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah finally something other than paranormal shit. This is the OG of scary movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't he died in previous movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,No fucking Rob Zombie? Finally!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers has always been the scariest of the horror film characters to me. Hairs stand up 100%
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"All of you twat waffles shitting on Rob Zombie's reboots are legit dumber than stumps (or legally blind). The extended back story alone was enough to blow the original away.

That being said, John Carpenter IS a fucking genius, and without him there would have been no Halloween for Zombie to upstage. So, instead of doing a movie that's already been done to death, a fresh idea would have been nice...or he could have always redone THEY LIVE. 

Guess I'll have to hope Rob does it instead. üòâ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want also a  straight sequel to Nightmare on Elm Street that take place after the original and ignore all of the sequels. They should bring back Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund.
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO FUNNY
ek1ePFp-nBI,C me paro xdx
ek1ePFp-nBI,in the end he dies. thats it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell no
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks really good and well done
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have questions already, why are the other patients getting excited on the chessboard? Those dudes don‚Äôt look like they keep current with the news, I‚Äôm just saying ya know!? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Isn‚Äôt Michael a senior citizen now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Miller's se
What i did there"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so good!!! Is that supposed to be Michael Myers?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can this one be the last please??!!?! Kill this character already!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Three teenagers and the guy who's clothes he stole. His body was in the bushes when Loomis found the abandoned truck. He just never saw it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my damn.... Here we go again!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it me or at 0:45 does it sound like pingus noot noot.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't feel so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://earnbig.ca/jjqQ compliting
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssssssssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ENOUGH with the ""mini previews"" before the actual preview!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,In the original film he was shot 6 times and fell off a balcony. Loomis looks off the same balcony & Michael is no longer where he landed. Which means he disappeared & is still alive? Right ? I wonder if they will explain that. Only confusing part. Very excited still.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks crazy good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This go hardü§üüèæ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Girl, it's Michael Myers. The second you see him appear in the closet, start running."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You got to give Jason and Chucky credit, the storylines in those films are pretty consistent, Friday remake not withstanding of course. They were never dogged by this alternate timeline bullshit. This series has become another TCM."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's up with producers remaking everything? It either turns out trash or you guys are literally out of ideas.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yay !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know what my favorite part is, the closet scene.. When she opens the door there is no sudden jolt and big noise - she just opens the door and he is there, old school horror"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm just hoping he doesn‚Äôt kill that dog üê∂ or I‚Äôll go John wick on his ass!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lame.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they changed the story line basically Halloween Resurrection Never Happened and she doesn‚Äôt die
ek1ePFp-nBI,The legend that never dies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You this is gonna be good 
A: Original Director
B: Some of the Original cast."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What the fuck is this bollocks? So Halloween 2 onwards never happened, and they get to retread moments from the franchise?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"most funny video prank
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1kuge5BXWo"
ek1ePFp-nBI,i wate for this movie like 9 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,check this out outhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJd3keMPlsY Pass it on!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow.  An actress with a British accent.  There pulling out all the stops now.  A sure Blockbuster.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow....now THIS is what you call a sequel!!! Not a carbon copy remake!!! Jamie Lee Curtis is back!!! And John Carpenter??? WOW!!! üëèüëèüëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That's why Hollywood is my favorite man.. 

You scared hell out of me 
And that horrifying background music wuuu.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What a shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry guys, I'm from the future and it sucks"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks so awesome I‚Äôve been Michael Myers twice for Halloween I guess this will be my third year
ek1ePFp-nBI,What are they saying at 1:13 - 1:18?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is 61 in 2018...I swear to god if there's a twist that the guy who's investigating him (the blond dude) is actually behind the mask during this movie I'm shooting myself in the foot....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please stop making these fucking movies. Slasher movies died 10 years ago. Nobody wants five thousands iterations of Halloween or nightmare on elm street or that other crap
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael opens hands,teeth fall out.....you don't FUCK with that,you turn and  run, cause that border line superhero strength! ü§î"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Hope we Michael wins this time lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks Good
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie could've been much shorter if the justice system allowed for the death penalty... just saying
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Much respect to the franchise but please stop...
ek1ePFp-nBI,dbd
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can see his face on min. 1:50 if you stop the right moment ....
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Boogeyman? call John Wick then and he'll kill the Boogeyman with a fuckin Pencil
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer basically showed the whole movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many people have said this franchise was all over my instincts telling me they were WRONG!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am shook
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck yes !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My dad's so great. Showed him the trailer since the franchise began in his teens and he's all.
""Um, I don't think she would have been able to close the door anyway. It's not on the hinges."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now that is how a horror movie is done
ek1ePFp-nBI,not really into the whole edgy training grandma plot device but overall this movie looks pretty damn hype.

ek1ePFp-nBI,i‚Äôm confused as to where this takes place among the Halloween series. Are they disregarding the movies after 2? What about H20? can someone explain?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Glad to see Curtis is still acting.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Straight to Netflix.
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohh exciting
ek1ePFp-nBI,"hey Hollywood, when are you going to show you actually have talent and do something original. al your doing is taking good stories and beating them into the ground"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Everyone hating on Rob Zombie‚Äôs remakes are forgetting 1 thing .... H20 now THAT was a disaster
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Best of all, the original actor who portrays Michael, Nick Castle, is back in the mask!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs back...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bout time we get a other slasher film. Getting sick of all this paranormal ghost shit

ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs litt
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve waited for sooooo long

ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by daylight :P
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Has michael myers ever been on a bus that did not crash?
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many Halloween movies are there? How many reboots and remakes? This is stupid af ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Isn't this the exact same plot as Halloween: H20? Being a sequel to only the original movie, skipping all the ones in between, and Jamie Lee Curtis playing a Laurie Strode who is paranoid and haunted by her past, and wants to kill Michael so she can move on? I wonder if we'll get another remake like this in 20 more years with a super old Jamie Lee Curtis and the same plot."
ek1ePFp-nBI,His head was chopped in h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just pallet loop him...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers killed Laurie Strode in Halloween Resurrection. How is she alive and in this movie?? So now I guess she's immortal like her brother. Doesn't make sense.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now this movie I wanna see. When‚Äôs the release date? I‚Äôve watch all the Halloween movies. Is there a way to kill Michael for good?
ek1ePFp-nBI,He should stop buy a Couple Kardashian‚Äôs house first
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hugh jackman's first & last scene as ""WOLVERINE"" https://youtu.be/W2cmYfkI9Ag"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank God no more Rob zombie bullshit üí© FU
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks crap same old Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie Lee Curtis died in Halloween resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,omggg second day of release and its #2 on trends in greece
ek1ePFp-nBI,i would've thought this has been done to death    (no pun intended).
ek1ePFp-nBI,Loved the trailer but first of all in the first one after Loomis shot him and he fell over the balcony he was not captured. He took off. Then when the bus crashed i know that guy and his son died because can yall imagine a bus full of psychos crashing and they were all loose in society like that. Also Michael showed a very sadistic side of him by dropping tgise teeth in that stall. Then when she shot at him threw that window Michael didnt even flinch. Last but not least. Its going to be an epic battle between him and his sister.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am really excited for this movie as i love the halloween franchise but one thing i dont understand how can lorrie strode be back and be a gran when michael killed her in the hospital in the halloween movie after halloween h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahhh worst night mare
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is going to be amazing aka how a reboot should be done
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://www.youtube.com/user/nikkiblackketter
ek1ePFp-nBI,yesssss <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dont know why but the piano music before Halloween theme reminded me of the Jurrasic World theme...cool trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee? I thought she supposed dead?
ek1ePFp-nBI,To kill someone on the toilet tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Do you believe in the Boogieman?""

ek1ePFp-nBI,"omg helppppppp  my heart has stopped 
üë∫"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope gangsta grandma will secure them
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween was one of my favorite scary movies back in the dad but I have some questions. 
1. Are they saying that Michael Myers has been locked up since the 1st one? That means all the sequels never happens? 
2. If Laurie Strode is a grandma, wouldn‚Äôt Michael Myers be like 75-80yrs old??
3. Why do they keep messing with that iconic mask????!!
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm still going to see it, but that mask kinda looked like the one from the Rob Zombie remakes. Triggered!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,But does it compare to baldiüòê
ek1ePFp-nBI,Daddy is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this supposed to be an action movie or a horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I imagined Dashie dancing when the theme played üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good horror movie trailers vs bad ones... 2:10
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't stop watching this
ek1ePFp-nBI,This comes out on my birthday I gotta go see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,The movie is going to be in the cinemas on 19 october... That is Michael Myers' birthday
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooooo the story line with jamie lee curtis being in witness protection as a private school principal didnt happen?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lorry Strode cut Michael's head off in Halloween H20 so how the fuck is he alive?oh that's right it was the butler dressed  as Michael that got his head cut off by Lorry,silly me.i call caca,peepee."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is consistently the only redeemable thing about these later movies. They are lucky she takes the roles.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:38 is that idubbz?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm watching it period.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well would you look at that, its still not scary smh."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Long live Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks mad, hes a real cunt on dead by daylight if you know what I mean"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is what happens when you never nut
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So are they retconning Laurie's death in Halloween: Resurrection? I'm into that idea, I always felt her death was unsatisfactory in that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,forward lots occasional permanent paint pepper country parental cope cheese ever award
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who is this rob zombie ppl are talking about ?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh wow I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie üé•
ek1ePFp-nBI,We need another Freddy movie with Robert Englund returning and it needs to be dark and scary again. Love to have seen Robert in this Halloween movie as a kinda Donald Pleasence character or as a psychiatrist of some sort. Billion times better than Rob Zombies...I can see that...for sure. I do hope it has tension and suspense. Will Patton is in this too. Hope Nick Castle has most of his scenes as Myers and not somebody else. Hope Carpenter does a wonderful score for this. I would have brought Alan Howarth back. Halloween 3 had a very very creepy score to go with the creepy movie. Still like H3. Curse of Michael Myers Producers Cut was quite good too. I have it on Blu ray. Halloween 4...yep great. 5 not good. 7 was okish. Rest I hated. This looks awesome again. Halloween 2 1981 was very good but had a few faults. Halloween 1978 faultless and an eternal classic in the horror genre.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't let the dog die.
ek1ePFp-nBI,We need another Freddy movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Groovy baby yeaah!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,HERE WE GO AGAIN. Poor William Shatner is probably like fucking hell can we stop this already.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait. Love the Halloween saga
ek1ePFp-nBI,This title should be the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This reminds me of Texas Chainsaw, where it takes place after the first but don't count the sequals. But If this after Resurrection, then that Asylum  must have the dumbest staff just for letting Michael ( a man that was shot like 1000 times, caught on fire TWICE, was captured by witches, and got tazed by electric wires in the BALLs)  be out in the open with other imates, handcuffs, and the German Shepherd he'd just eat for a snack."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is my favorite horror franchise 

Why does this need to exist? It's been played out and this new film brings nothing new to the table.  It's just a combination of the other films before it.

Stupid to even make this.  Money, money, money is all it's about and driving old IP into the ground when new IP could be created"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is there a mini trailer before the actual trailer?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Isn't this like the 9th iteration or something?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks lit but gonna wait for it to come on Netflix
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks good can't wait to view it online illegally
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:59 that has got to be the house
ek1ePFp-nBI,They haven't learned to keep Michael's ass off of busses and ambulances. üòÇ. He always escape.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been waiting for this for so longüíÄüíÄüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You wudda thought after the massacre this dude left behind in haddonfield everybody in the town would be familiar with his mask and constant walking around the areas but nope, he's at it again and nobody bats an eyelid"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"they need to switch up the name on some of these remakes... how many ""halloween"" movies are there now?.. it gets hard trying to find the right one on putlocker or something."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, Halloween won't be released on Halloween..?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you pause at 2:09, you could see another person at the left window. It has to jason for sure"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Didn't she chop his head off the last Halloween, how is he still alive"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this is epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks good to me but my only criticism based off this trailer is I'm not buying Laurie being a badass who spent decades waiting for her revenge. I'm afraid that will be the annoying factor. The original Halloween is my favorite horror/thriller of all time. I also like 2 & 3. That's about it for me and the franchise. I feel like this might cut it and be enjoyable. I'm definitely going to see this one in the theatre, a rare occasion for me. Let's try to be positive, if we pick at everything there is little to enjoy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks SO F GREAT!!! reminds me of the originals.  Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,YaY! Just what we needed!! ANOTHER Re-make!!ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I hope is good though. I really do.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait fortnite make new skin about this Halloween character
ek1ePFp-nBI,last scene awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow superb 2018 ........................
ek1ePFp-nBI,By far my fav movie grew up watching them all hope they keep to the origanl story line.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times can you remake a movie before it turns to old pile of shit ? Let the movie be and stop making shitty remakes
ek1ePFp-nBI,You should
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I want see this thriller !!!! 
It is so coolü§§"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got shivers when the theme started playing

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that a Henry Repeater or a Winchester?
ek1ePFp-nBI,What if this is like Godzilla and Jamie lee Curtis dies in the first 30 minutes and it becomes a lame teen slasher
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Will Be The Best Movie Of 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck Yes!!!
I am so tired of the Comic Book Movies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Du du du *du* du du Du du DU du du Du du du *DU* Du...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a remake? Didn't she die in the other movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok..I am a huge Michael Myers fan. Huge. But to completely disregard the movies after the 2nd one is kind of blasphemy. Honestly? They need to do a reboot. Not a Rob Zombie style that is a completely different take on it...but an actual legitimate reboot. Start it over, and plan on sequels too. I notice people abandon movies too soon. Look at the 2008 Friday the 13th. Was it great? No. But it wasn't horrendous like it gets labeled. I just hate it when a new group comes along, makes 1 movie, and then scraps it. Completely amateur hour and pretty reckless by movie making standards. It takes time. You can't just abandon the ship after it gets a little water in the boat. You keep going until you know it is going down."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm SO exited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,its not even close to Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt have a Halloween move without Jamie lee Curtis
ek1ePFp-nBI,She knows Michale won‚Äôt die
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Actually this looks kinda promising 

Edit: It‚Äôs a sequel"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So I am all for a new Halloween movie, but isn‚Äôt the plot a little contradicting bc Jamie Lee‚Äôs character died in the last movie"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow #3 en tendencias in ecuador
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, ... child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes."

ek1ePFp-nBI,everyone gonna dress like this in halloween guarenteed
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ablosute crap! I can understand not claiming Part 3 but parts 2, 4, 5? Screw you! Not watching!  They are rewitting the original, he wasn't caught at the end if the original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope its not like Halloween resurrection üëå

ek1ePFp-nBI,Will it come out in indonesia?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this movie related to the 2000's Halloween or the 1978 one of the 2007 one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,That kid set that woman up at the end. Michael is notorious for not killing small children. He did it on purpose
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/XLdmwn3gxSA
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they don't pallet loop him
ek1ePFp-nBI,As a real Halloween fan I was very disappointed on movies past the 3rd movie which btw I don‚Äôt know why everyone hated when the 3rd movie game out. It was original and fresh where halloween could‚Äôve went in a different direction. With that being said I like the bases of the movie and cannot wait To watch it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this a remake or a sequel??
ek1ePFp-nBI,ENTER John Wick the one sent to kill the fucking boogeyman
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG AWESOMNESSES!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,1 word: YEEEEEESSSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Also, how did Michael Myers end up back in a Psychiatric Hospital again? How was his mask taken away from him, and in the possession of some random person? I thought he was being protected by a cult. Is the a movie I missed that explains all of this, or did I miss something while watch in the Halloween movies?? Other than that........ I'M HYPED ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúThe Shape‚Äù is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Slipknot the movie

ek1ePFp-nBI,oke how micheal is dead i the last movie how is he back

ek1ePFp-nBI,That was her brother nd he's BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait........ I thought his sister died......
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks shite
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Whoa, Jamie Lee Curtis is a baddie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not only did he kill those teenagers he also killed his family by the way
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for the release of this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she died tho... wtf?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 it's the doctor who brought Michael the mask you haft to pause it at the right time. It's the one hitting his face on the stall if you pause it at the right time it's the doctor.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"#3 on trending, from a low budget 1978 film to now‚Äù the greatest horror film‚Äù of all time - JOHN CARPENTER THE GREATEST LETSS GOOOOOO"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else thinks they should also remake The Fog with Carpenter involved. I'm ignoring that 2005 peice of shit and the producers should also.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Turns out mike Meyers is a transgender black woman, currently identifying as a left handed Asian female..... WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That was terrible.

The writing is shit.
The acting is pretty bad.
Just the concept of this movie, and even then all that really matters is execution."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to see Michael Myers vs John Wick personally no idea why just something.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:08 something is standing there in the next window üò∂
ek1ePFp-nBI,The king has returned üòàüî™

ek1ePFp-nBI,music at 00:50 is the jurassic park theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome. Finally a sequel worth waiting for. Ok folks this new movie is a direct sequel to the 1978 film. Why? Because all the other films (why most of them.being great) make no sense. And would confuse the audience. They would have to ignore the last 2 films and make this take place after 8. But Jamie Lee died so that cant happen either. So make it take place after h20. But it's been 20 yrs since that film and it's about keeping the same audience while also getting new fans. This new movie is gonna attract new fans to the franchise .blame rob zombie if you hate this new sequel. And to have carpenter back is amazing. And the ORIGINAL actor who played Myers in 78 is back to play him again. And yes Michael would be about 65 yrs old. Same age as the actor who's playing him. So it's a perfect fit. Danny McBride is a longtime fan of Halloween so he made this film as a FAN. this movie is gonna be AWSOME!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ch ch ch ch, ah ah ah ah. . . Oh wait. . ."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs go
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Good old Hollywood, fucking up classic movies with shit producers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seeing people get murdered is really fun.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Written by Danny McBride?
ek1ePFp-nBI,And the classic music
ek1ePFp-nBI,The worst way to die is definitely when taking a shit.. this is why I don't trust public bathrooms
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!
ek1ePFp-nBI,BAD ASS !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Only problem is, it's called Halloween and it's a direct sequel to the 1978 film Halloween. I sense marketing problems, just like when the 2011 film The Thing came out and it was a prequel to the 1982 film of the exact same name. The problem is a film called Halloween 2 has already been made, and they are SO many sequels to disregard in making this..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is exactly why I never ever use public bathrooms

ek1ePFp-nBI,He wasn't taken into custody after being shot? Are they forgetting Halloween 2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt Michael Meyers get his head cut off by Jamie Lee Curtis in one of the sequels?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait... didn‚Äôt Laurie get killed in Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This actually looks like it could be good.. Guess they got a REAL director this time, and not some egomaniacal self absorbed pop shlock star.."

2¬†Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.

3¬†Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Do you believe in the boogeyman?"" Is this going to be John Wick vs Michael Myers?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want my refund back in 2002 when I saw Halloween resurrection so we're going to pretend like Laurie didn't die? I'm still going to see it because I'm a horror fan the ending of the trailer won me over
ek1ePFp-nBI,*COMING SOON ON HALLOWEEN*
ek1ePFp-nBI,He hates his sister why?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is it trendy to give sequels the same title as the first movie nowadays?

ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That's what i call a trailer for a real horror movie, high hopes for this one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Totally not scared just after watching the trailer, totally not.."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:44 what is that ?? Can someone please tell me, idk.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's official.. We've lost the ability to make good horror movies... If the trailer is this bad, one can only assume the travesty that's going to be the full release"
ek1ePFp-nBI,And now I'm actually hopeful. Looks like it's going to be amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This sure looks stupid

ek1ePFp-nBI,*MY LONGEST YEAH BOI EVER*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm still sad that Friday the 13th won't get a reboot c'mon guys Jason neends some love to :l
ek1ePFp-nBI,Normally im not scared of Halloween ive watched all of then thousands of times but this one gave me the chills
ek1ePFp-nBI,They already made a remade of Halloween in 2009...why make it again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,#freetommyrobinson
ek1ePFp-nBI,The night *he* came home - again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Michael Myers is two stalls down from you what the fuck do you do?
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:09 there‚Äôs a person with a hoodie in the far left window jheez
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie ain't scared anymore
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amaing :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is it like H2O or something
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why can't it come out now
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks AMAZING!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I dont do horror movies but that trailer did things to me. I  need to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guess she couldnt spare a square for michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh i already watch that!! üòÇ that was good though!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This makes no sense she chopped his head off that was the one LL Cool J played in and back in the 80's  he was burned alive wtf Mike Myers ain't Jason Voorhees
ek1ePFp-nBI,why does she still use a lever action gun? I'm sure a semi auto rifle should do the trick
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks bad
ek1ePFp-nBI,you better all bring decisive strike people!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, I know we are supposed to forget about Halloween 3 because that had nothing to do with the original Halloween. But is this supposed to be a direct sequel from the original and all the others don't exist anymore? So Laurie Stroud didn't chop MM head off and doesn't have a son anymore? This looks good either way but I'm a little confused. Lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bout Time
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY! A remake that looks awesome af.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks dope! üò±üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only way to make this movie good, would be to start it with a scene of Michael killing some people with the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 intro playing."

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:07 the little kids mask looks like the skeleton mask from Halloween 3
ek1ePFp-nBI,wait... I thought micheal killed laurie in resurrection... ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so glad Laurie Strode is back.  Hated that they killed her in Resurrection.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween ka naya part aa gaya kya
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter is back.  Nuff said
ek1ePFp-nBI,CAN'T WAIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good. I work with a guy who is basically Michael Myers. He's a hoot.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, are we now disregarding Jamie Lee Curtis' death in Halloween: Resurrection?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is Micheal Myers Canadian?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excite!!! I have been waiting for Halloween to be remade by john carpenter!!!!! I can't wait to see it!!!!! Looks soooo good.   I love the fact that they are starting a different storyline and starting off after part 1 that was a genius idea on their part for forgetting all the bullshit that was done after part 1.  I mean part 2 was good but I still like that they are changing it up.  H1 and H2 were my favorite movies when I was a kid and because of those movies I probably only slept about an hour between the ages of 5 and 11 lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Film theory: If the woman was doing her business before Michael walked in, then why was her trousers done up when she got pulled out.

ek1ePFp-nBI,A slasher horror movie where the victim is hunting the villain? This looks surprisingly well thought out... though I feel like the non-Jamie Lee scenes are going to be underwhelming. Hopefully their interactions will make up for it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just can not stop watching... !!!! üéÉüî™I love Michael in here ... I know there‚Äôs going to be a trilogy... there has to be

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Before you get too excited, kids, just remember that blumhouse also made Truth or Dare"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Glad Jamie Lee Curtis has been willing to keep coming back to the Halloween franchise. Wouldn't have been the same without her.
However, not sure what's the point in advertising a Halloween movie at the beginning of summer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,MIRAMAX OMG

ek1ePFp-nBI,They brought back the og‚Äôs because horror movies were starting to die out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Of course Hollywood is going to give the green light to a classic horror film that would be new to millennials. They will also cash in on die hard Halloween fans like myself. John Carpenter is doing this one so it should be good. I'm in. Slasher movies have to be seen on the big screen.

ek1ePFp-nBI,why is every movie trailer so generic
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:09 pause look at the left window that is blue there is another person
ek1ePFp-nBI,All fans must get all success
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter is back at it again! this time its the true master of horror and not rob zombie's version
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping people from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."

ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so excited for this! üòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So does that mean the last Halloween movie is not canon?

....

Joking aside I am very happy for this. With Chucky, Jason, Pennywise, and Freddy Krueger trying to maintain their credibility since they were first created, its only fitting that Michael Meyers also hangs on tight to his reign 


Just please be better then the ‚Äúlast Halloween movie‚Äù. Hopefully that‚Äôs not asking for much"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not again
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm excited

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hi guys, my new channel, based photography, traveling, wildlife, food, tribs lifestyle, medicine etc, pls suscribe my channel for more, 
https://youtu.be/bC0xWy_8vZ0"
ek1ePFp-nBI,im so confused they said his doctor shot him in the head and after that they took him to an asylum so are they jus gonna forget about the other sequels?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So in this timeline Halloween 2 doesn't exist. So this makes Michael about 58 or 59 yrs old??
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ù§üî•üí™üíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,holy shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Takes place 40 years after the original. This film ignores all the sequels including Halloween 2. John Carpenter said he wanted Michael to be more scary than before and the motivation to off his sister is not scary enough so that's why the lore started with Halloween 2 has been forgotten. Nick Castle the original actor credited as the shape is portraying Michael in this film.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I would like to see another Friday the 13th reboot but the last one got cancelled
ek1ePFp-nBI,hell yeah !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Guys please help a brother out, all I ask is for you to look at just one of my videos"
ek1ePFp-nBI,finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy shit micheal myers is back

In 2018"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks good but h20 and resurrection ignored 4,5,6 and now this one will ignore 2. So since Myers has been locked up for 40 years then technically he isn‚Äôt a serial killer just a dude that killed 3 ppl on one night. And wouldn‚Äôt he be 60 years old now. If a 60 year old guy can hunt me down and kill me then I deserve it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this follows the original Halloween and all the other movies didn‚Äôt exist, I like the sound of that, perhaps someone should suggest that to the Starwars franchise and everything after the first three movies also doesn‚Äôt exist and Luke skywalker wakes up from a very bad dream."
ek1ePFp-nBI,But in Resurrection didn‚Äôt he throw Laurie off the building didn‚Äôt she die or did I miss something but I‚Äôm still excited about it no one scares me more than Michael Myers the music always gets me I hear it and I‚Äôm like oh shit something is about to happen üò¨

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Instead of naming it Halloween again, they should rename it ""The Night He Came Home"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just wish John Carpenter was directing this film - since he is executive producer I'm going to give it a go. From the late 70s to the mid 90s he put out some of the best films. To this day he is my favorite horror director. There's no one like him in all of cinema! I'm looking forward to seeing this in the theater during Halloween!

ek1ePFp-nBI,crap. worse trite crap
ek1ePFp-nBI,Haven't they milked the franchise enough? I also hate the fact that they retcon the entire series. I didn't like the sequels but I do know the building of the fan base was because of those films.

ek1ePFp-nBI,yes our music is halloween listen to music our
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thanksman
ek1ePFp-nBI,No it's june
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait is gonna be so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Look, 

This movie will be great, but I'm not too impressed with the story. When they said Michael was in Asylum for 40 years... They basically cut all of the other movies. Number two - Halloween Resurrection never happened.

See if they would of thought a better story they could of cut Halloween resurrection rather than the whole franchise. Here's why: 

When Halloween H20 came out Michael Sister was more prepared in that movie, and was ready. When she hiding behind the curtens ( sorry for not spelling it right.) she stabbed him over I believe 10 times, and Michael Myers tripped 3 stories down, and got knocked out cold by landing on the table. They should of ended it by the cops arresting Michael, and putting him into the crazy asylum for 20 years. That would make more sense rather than killing off 4 movies even though 3 of them didn't really matter. I just hope there's more into the story because I think they really ruined the franchise by doing this. Regardless of what they do I will still see this movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Didn't she knock his head off in H20 back in '98, with LL Cool J :|"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope the old lady dies in the end and he stays loose
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't let this distract you from the fact that Star-Lord punched Thanos in the face and killed half of the Avengers...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"William Shatner ain't scary, I'll pass on this one again ü§¢"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thankgod rob zombie didnt film this.. the last Halloween movies he made sucked!! Almost every characters line had the word ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù it got so fucking annoying to hear that in every fucking sentence üòÇüôÑüôÑ

ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/_O4ik9zZE88
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks so bad, that it makes the Rob Zombie versions seem like the ""Gone with the Wind"" of horror movies. Just terrible. It's like they made a parody of the first film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So no one is gonna say anything about It saying this Halloween, but at the end it says October 19"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why tf did I think he dropped Skittles into the restroom stall üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like it will be a different kind of Michael Myers movie. Still excited for it though
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait, Jamie Lee looking badass....and hot!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,When its Summer but you can't wait for Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No Donald Pleasance, No John Carpenter, No Danielle Harris = Not my Halloween. I'd rather see Zombie's Halloween 3 than this hot piece of garbage."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The likes and dislikes really shows how i feel about this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,How long has he be waiting and what did he did when he was locked up ü§îü§îü§îü§î

Make sure your feet are tuck  in the blanket.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I'll probably end up watching it LOL. But I really think Rob Zombie's remake was the best so far the first one not the second one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie and Carpenter are involved so I'll watch this. I miss  '70s/80s John Carpenter.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait so all the sequels weren't canon even the one in 1981?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just spoiled a scene. 
If you play the video at its lowest setting... You find that the dude headbutting the bathroom door isn't Michael. It's actually the reporter dude who pulled out his mask. So apparently Michael either bashes her coworkers head against the door after killing him.. Or the dude tries to save her after finding the other dead body and gets slammed into the door.
However, my theory is that the reporter is actually in on it. 
What of he takes over Myers mask and kills everyone and the scene where Myers puts on the mask isn't actually in the movie or is at the end of the movie after they find out who the killer was only to tease the Real Myers coming back."
ek1ePFp-nBI,when will be the release in india

ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else's butthole pucker up when Michael dropped those teeth?
ek1ePFp-nBI,now i wanna play Dead by Deaylight using Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,Worst movie ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god I‚Äôm so fucking horny now
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will they finally answer the question of who taught Michael Myers how drive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait... Meyers was captured? The guy who has died multiple times and come back? Talk about the shittiest movie yet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait I am Michael Myers biggest fan. üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ‚õèÔ∏è‚õèÔ∏è‚õèÔ∏è‚õèÔ∏è‚õèÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yes!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie lee Curtis is so dope, thank you"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OK I hate to be a Debbie downer especially after the shit we got from Rob Zombie but from what I'm seeing I'm in the caution zone not liking what they're doing with the story that the events of Halloween II seem to be ignored and Michael was captured and re imprisoned and also not liking they gave Jamie Lee Curtis a granny look just doesn't feel like it fits her role.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If that baby sitter doesn‚Äôt get out of the way and grabs the kid and runs I will be so mad
ek1ePFp-nBI,Only thing about this is that I hope it has a sub title. It becomes confusing when there's two movies in the franchise with the same name. Please let the movie title be it's own thing and not the same as the one that came before it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie is alive i thought that stab killed her
ek1ePFp-nBI,About time. Cause that Rob Zombie Version was bullcrap..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aw yeah boii
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait dudeeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why won't you just like Micheal stay dead? I though we all agreed that Halloween had a good couple of movies but all good things have to end so please let him rest in peace!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers ruined my halloween spirit when the first movie came out. But then again im here ready to watch this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,John carpenter!!! üôåüôå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That moment when you close your closet door but opens back up... 





Haven't seen any of these films in this franchise but this looks really good!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, this ignores the events of 3-6, H20 and the found footage one? It‚Äôs another timeline. Laurie‚Äôs daughter is shown in the trailer, is that supposed to be the same daughter from 4,5,6, but in the new timeline? A granddaughter is shown as well, is that supposed to be the baby that Paul Rudd found in 6, but in the new timeline? I‚Äôm assuming that their not going to do the Uncle Dad Michael thing again. What I‚Äôm asking is, are they going to have the same names?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can they give my boy Mike a live interest like killers need love to

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks really good actually!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Mike Myers is now an average guy who's a 70 year old actor? WHY? Why is a 70 year old actor playing as Mike Myers? Why? A 70 year old short guy. How's that supposed to be an intimidating powerhouse like Mike Myers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Eh.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I NEED TO TAKE A SHIT. OPEN THE DAMN DOOR. 1:46

ek1ePFp-nBI,"@1:56 MY GOD THAT MUSIC!!! 

I was at Niagara Falls's Haunted house (Clifton Hill to be precise), where this music was on with no lights and creepy noises were coming from the pitch dark narrow hallways. #Roadtrip"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This nigga still escaping from the same hospital? Why he can't die? Just dismember his ass and set it on fire. And, why are they still living in that town, move out Bitch!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anyone else pull the hair off there nuts?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she chopped off his head in h2o ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is basically saying everything after Halloween 2 didn't happen...and honestly I'm kind of okay with that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahhh idk about this but I'll still watch it I like the Rob Zombie version but the Original is the best.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another crappy remake of a classic looks like. Hollywood seems out of original ideas.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is soo beautiful i just wanna cry
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs taking back the old Michael Myer average height dude roots from the original movies over the one from rob zombies bulky and tall Michael

ek1ePFp-nBI,I love it when they bring that  Michael Myers theme song back.The memories are coming back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't believe their doing an AU version of Halloween. Its like #4&5 never happened. But then again H20 was an alternate what could have happened. They can't seem to keep one plot line down. Glad they made another one. So going to watch this.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Stop messing with classics. Just be original God damn it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôve legitimately waited my whole life for this. I‚Äôm so glad they made this one with ‚ÄúLaurie‚Äù still alive instead of how she died in Halloween: Resurrection. This is and will always be my favorite movie franchise, ever since I was 6 years old I was renting every movie (except Halloween 3), on a weekly basis. So stoked üî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I remember there was an abandoned home on the outskirts of Lexington South Carolina that they turned into a haunted house around Halloween. Well while you‚Äôre waiting in line, they have tall big dudes walking around in these coveralls and Michael masks and a fake knife. Me being a kid at the time didn‚Äôt know this, and I remember going to the restrooms which were port o johns near the outskirts of the whole compound (which had lighting, haystacks and generators, etc.) bUt it was within view of the main line. Anyway when I was taking a dump due to being really nervous it got very quiet. The talks from the main line stopped and it was just the hums of the generators. I felt this warmth go over me and I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. When I went to open the door, it didn‚Äôt really open, so I pushed harder. Harder. Finally frustrated and feeing a sense of panic, I just threw all my body weight into the door, and I came busting out. Right when i started looking up, this Big tall figure was standing directly in front of me. It was Michael. It was the first time I ever saw him or what he was. I felt my entire body just give out from under me. I was border lining fainting. I could feel my legs buckle. Luckily he caught me instead of letting me fall since I was probably only 10-11 years old. Everyone thought it was hilarious. Whole line of probably 50+ people just started laughing; My parents too. I‚Äôll never forget that feeling. Everytime I see this dude I can smell that dudes coveralls and I feel a subtle sense of panic lingering. Crazy what something like that can do almost 20 years later."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Scout Taylor-Compton is still my favourite Laurie Strode. The Rob Zombie remakes were amazing.

ek1ePFp-nBI,In not gonna watch this movie. I mean why these MF gotta re hash old shit. We got enough Halloween movies. Try to come up an original concept. Basically these guys at Universal lazy as fuck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here is my ranking of the Halloween movies:
1. Halloween (1978) - Great classic movie
2. Halloween 2 (1981) - Underrated and one of the best horror movie sequels ever
3. Halloween 4 (1988) - Good/decent, liked the opening scene music, went back to the basics
4. Halloween 3 (1982) - Seems to have a new cult following; thought the movie was okay
5. Halloween 5 (1989) - Had a few okay parts, but did not like the direction with the thorn curse
6. Halloween H20 - Did not like the scream 90s horror movie feel
7. Halloween 6 (1996) - Sucked
8. Zombie I - White trash version with a bunch of blood and gore, but not much substance (made Loomis look like a pussy)
9. Zombie II - more of the same crap
10. Halloween Resurrection - Pathetic and not even worth mentioning"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Scary movie that actually looks like a good movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think I shit my pants

ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn I wanted the Blonde girl to survive but guess she‚Äôll die and so does the girl on the bathroom. Damn üòì
ek1ePFp-nBI,This gave me the chills
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The trailer is well-done. I am very excited about this movie. I am a huge Halloween fan and have been since the original. I sure hope this is good. I am not a big fan of having Laurie Strode be this bad ass feminist. Her vulnerability and thinking on the fly is what made the original movie more realistic and suspenseful. Also, I hope this movie has an old-fashioned realistic feel and limits technological tricks and special effects. One reservation I have is not including Halloween 2 (1981). I feel like the first two movies are edged in peoples' minds as being one movie. I understand John Carpenter not liking the sister thing he came up with while drunk. Also, perhaps he did not like a supernatural Myers. However, Myers was shot six times, poked in the eye, stabbed in the stomach, etc... The fact that he got up and walked away makes him supernatural. Also, if he is coming after Laurie Strode again it takes away the randomness element that Carpenter said he liked rather than chasing his sister. Personally, I thought Halloween 2 was enjoyable. In fact, I liked it almost as much as the original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 blondy_47 has lost connection
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeahh
ek1ePFp-nBI,All you people shitting on this fail to realize that with this new John Carpenter movie everything after Halloween 2 is no longer canon. Let John Carpenter bring the franchise back from the dead

ek1ePFp-nBI,Poha meu serial killer preferido est√° de volta üíÄüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,They made a movie about the shape!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've got one question for you...
Do you believe in the boogyman?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"October is my birthday, and this is the perfect gift <3"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I only came here to listen to the theme.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why did they try to make that old hag as if she's a badass? And looking for a Serial Killer that rips people with his bare hands and also took multiple gun shots She really thinks that she has a chance of killing him?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so fuckin hyped üò≠üò≠ MICHAEL IS THE BEST KILLER ALIVE. Literally been dying for another Halloween and we getting it.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers was geht
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn man..... i gotta see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,For all the people who are not up to date. This movie follows the original. So with anything after the first one doesn‚Äôt  exist. Michael and Laurie are not brothers and Michael is mortal. This will be the closest we will get to the original. It‚Äôs a sequel slash ‚Äúpun intended‚Äù reboot that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who would win?
One badass Grandma or One kickass serial Killer?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Micheal's been killing since the 70s and he's still strong and able, I wanna know what's his diet cause when I get old I want to be still pumping like him.



Oh wait, his diet is killing people."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I do believe this trailer is a-ok.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now for, friday the 13th to come out"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That stupid old bitch lady is gunna ruin the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank you for writing out h20 but I still think the 2nd one should have been spared atleast considering how the first one clearly ended with him getting up and leaving after dr loomis unloaded his gun on him.  Why would an invincible person allow themselves to get caught?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder who would win Michael Myers vs Leather face
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad ass Grandma.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah excited hopefully it wont be a let down
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe the other movies did happen, and it's all in Jamie Lee curtis dream?! At the end she wakes up in a mental hospital, and turns and the mask is there?! She realises she's Michael Myers and she's being doing all the killings?! ... üòÄ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks hilarious!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:59 mark: Michael bumps into a kid with a stereo on his shoulder just like in part 2.   I read somewhere that while the other sequels have been retconned, they will still have Easter eggs referencing them for the fans."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im fucking hypeeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah KILL HIS ASS JAMIE LEE FINISH THISSSSS!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,That's still one of the best movie themes ever made.
ek1ePFp-nBI,You already know this movie is ganna be less gory and trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it me or this mask looks even more scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow I wanna watch so creepy though, Jamie lee phenomenal"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hollywood has nothing to give . That‚Äôs why I stick with the old movies . The new releases just crap .
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hate when trailers tell the movie's whole plot.  I hope they left out some hidden goodies.  I can about tell you this is the how the movie will happen. 


So we'll meet Laurie and her family on a nice normal day in the few days leading up to Halloween.  The doctor/documentary dude goes to Laurie's home to ask for an interview.  She denies him or gives him a speach.  the documentary team go to Smith's Grove State Hospital and meets Myers and they get freaked out.  They move the prisoners for some reason and Michael escapes.  The documentary crew ends up at same gas station Myers is hiding. (These two things can be flip flopped.) He gets his uniform, mask, and makes the documentary team temporarily believe in the boogeyman.  First 20 minutes right there. 

Michael shows up on Halloween day, stocks Laurie's granddaughter and her friends.  He kills the one girl in yellow, puts her on a chair with a white blanket. Laurie is somehow informed of this, probably due to the sheriff deputy standing in the room on the far side in blue lighting when she takes a crack shot at the mirror. 

No one else sees him. She gets told she's crazy.  Her daughter and husband takes Laurie and Granddaughter back to Laurie's where Michael follows. He kills Laurie's son in law, they run around the house for a while. Laurie has a 1v1 with Michael, eventually he gets the best of her.  The granddaughter steps in and gets the kill.  Holds mamaw in her arms as she dies. 

Police finally show up.  The ending  is left ambiguous, maybe, for one more sequel if this one is a giant success, which it is looking like it is going to be."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why are most of the modern hero‚Äôs names ‚ÄúMichael‚Äù?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes, you will have my dollars for this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAYY

ek1ePFp-nBI,Just kill him already. You have a chainsaw start cutting and stop using guns.
ek1ePFp-nBI,4.4k dislikes?!? They must be the same kind if people who think Halloween 3 is the best of the series.

ek1ePFp-nBI,best comedy of the year
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I mean, I'll see it...but the creators shouldn't have gone on a spiel for months about how this would replicate the original in tone and feel and bring it back to basics. Maybe the original as an action horror movie with 50x the budget. This screams big budget glossy horror film, not simple, effective scarefest like the original. And what's with the violence? The original was known for its restraint in that regard. Critics back THEN even thought it was tame in '78. Now Michael is pulling out teeth?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,we have the mountain now.....this guy aint that scary.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welcome home my dude welcome back we missed u

ek1ePFp-nBI,"You've fooled them, haven't you Michael? Well, you haven't fooled me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be good...
ek1ePFp-nBI,ü§îü§îü§î looks pretty awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is set after the events Halloween Part2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I get the whole forget everything in between thing. But if he killed them 40 years ago. He's getting executed in Illinois. Not reincarcerated to a psych ward.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank God that Rob Zombie won‚Äôt be in this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this basically takes place 40 years after Halloween 2, which is a smart move to ignore all the other sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,You need John Wick to deal with the fkn Boogie man
ek1ePFp-nBI,Frightening
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hopefully this movie will make me shit myself, Horror movies haven't really been scary lately. Like if you want to shit urself. LOL"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Here comes all the movie experts
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is there even any point in worrying about Laurie Strode, she's already survived an explosion and being thrown off a building, she's basically invincible at this point."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Who remembers playing Micheal Myers on COD. Those were the good days
ek1ePFp-nBI,Haven't had a trailer make me smile n feel gross at the same time in awhile.... Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know who ever's in charge of the security at these mental hospitals he keeps escaping from really should have lost their job after the sixth time or seventh time it happened.
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 on trending... Hell Yeah!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks good but what about that Michael vs Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this film is basically going to wipe out the others besides the original and its sequel... Okay I suppose I can deal with that. Just PLEASE in the name of THORN do not mess this up!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pumpkin has same face that childish gambino makes in the beginning of this is america.
ek1ePFp-nBI,can curtis save it from being the most overrated and basic horror film...sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,"A third movie now called ""Halloween""? Wtf?
It looks cool but its a sequel to Halloween called Halloween...and yet is not the movie Halloween."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I LOVE Michael Myers this will forever be the original scary ass mofo. And so far original.   
Except the dum 1 with busta rhymes."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So we are going by Godzilla reboot logic where it is just a sequel to the original and ignores any other continuation?
(Not upset, this is far better than remaking the movie again)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don‚Äôt fuck this up >_<
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like the Halloween franchise but how many times Michael coming back üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this movie is pretending the other films never happened.... that‚Äôs fine and all but the title of the movie should reflect that. Like let‚Äôs say those films didn‚Äôt happen, the sequel to Halloween is Halloween... just a little pet peeve"

ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to be excited but I'm rolling my eyes at this......
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a return of the classic slasher horror movie!!! Sick of these psychological/possession/ghost movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let me just say this at 2:35 I bet FUCKING MONEY that it‚Äôs not really Micheal but just that blonde girls boyfriend dresses up as the killer, he scares her and then she gets mad and shoves him. They blonde girl tells the little boy that she‚Äôs babysitting goodnight and then her and her douche bag boyfriend go downstairs and make out and then all of a sudden they hear noises, the boyfriend goes to check it out.. and guess who it is? Michael, no surprise there. He kills the boyfriend and then the dumb blonde goes to look for him to only find he‚Äôs dead and then runs into Michael . Runs away but eventually gets caught. Boom!

ek1ePFp-nBI,This one looks good but Rob Zombies remake of part 1 will always be the GOAT
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey Universal!!  You want to build a successful ""monsters cinematic universe""?  Put Micheal Myers in it.  You're welcome!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Guess#1: They think they got him but he is still out there.
Guess#2: He dies but at the cost of someone's sanity that that person wants to inherit is role.
Guess#3: She has been hullucinating him into obsession that she ends up killing a lot of innocent people unknowingly."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Starring Mike Meyers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People who are criticising the disconnection to all of the other instalments (previous sequels, prequels...what have you) need to lighten up. This is exciting. Its like reading one of those kids novels that had alternate pathways and endings. It's like we've reached the end of the line from the original H through to H20 (bar the RZ reboots) but now we're going back and taking a different course, the one we chose not to. This trailer is great and I can not wait to see the movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why?  Just focus on Activia...

ek1ePFp-nBI,Y'all ready??!!! I've been ready ever since Jamie Lee Curtis tweeted last September that they'd be doing it one last time!!! I can't wait!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks pretty good: let's hope it isn't a big fuck up
ek1ePFp-nBI,The old woman reminds me of Brandon Rogers for some reason üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I used to be terrified of this fucker when i was a kid
ek1ePFp-nBI,Waiting for Justin Y. to comment lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,These Michael Meyers movies are getting too old.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can we just take a moment to realize what that poor kid is about to witness 2:30
ek1ePFp-nBI,So we are just supposed to forget he killed before
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 so we gonna ignore the fact that michael was camping in a closet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,wasn't gonna see it until I saw Jamie Lee is in it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just hope that the game dead by daylight will be able to get rights to use the this micheal myers oufit and old laurie strode as a skin, hopefully also I think this will be a 8/10 movie but I could be wrong"

ek1ePFp-nBI,So im guessing she survived her fall off the roof in ressurection or are they not making h20 and that cannon with this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish they didn't erase most of the canon. It makes him look less badass that he only killed a few people now. But this trailer does look good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sometimes my hopes don get let down when some movies I am interested are produced by blumhouse... but people keep in mind they also produced the MASTERPIECE, ‚ÄúWhiplash‚Äù and that‚Äôs top 5 of my favorite movies of all time.... so because of that I often have to give them a chance despite the trash they have regurgitated to the masses at times.... anyways, looks decent."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow so they really going to come out with a new one I hope it‚Äôs good man?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pallet loops incoming.

*sigh* Would your mother be proud of you?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HES DEAD STOP GO BACK TO SLEEP
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be a shitty movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I will NEVER forgive mirimax for Mars Attack!!! That movie made me afraid of aliens for years when I was a kid. I though they would shoot my mom and turn her into a skeleton then come for me open my door and go MEEP MEEP MEEP MEEP! Calling his friends over because they found me and they would shoot me and turn me into a skeleton. My mom kept a tape of the song that killed them at the end in a old radio by my bed so if they showed up I could play it and make they're heads explode. I asked her ""what about you mommy"" she said ""don't worry I have a really loud boom box and this remote, if they show up I'll just turn on the song and they're head will blow up just like in the movie"" my dad kept harassing me later in life saying that he was going to buy a life size alien from the movie and I told him if that ever shows up at our house I will destroy it beyond recognition."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why would she close the closet door with the lights still on ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer turned into a yogurt commercial fast
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait.nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this the one Danny McBride worked on ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks gay
ek1ePFp-nBI,The kills were way more gruesome in the Rob Zombie Halloweens...so stop saying his versions were trash..that shit was lit üëåüòÇ...watch the kills in this movie be simple & quick as fuck üòÇ..u people never Happy
ek1ePFp-nBI,michael meyers? as in Shrek/austin powers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,YYYYYEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,When she tried closing the door at the end i almost lost it
ek1ePFp-nBI,john carpenter on the keys yuppp
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers with that Old Man Strength- pulling teeth and flipping buses with his mind.
ek1ePFp-nBI,michael the real killer man
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason where you at tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,sooo finally michael takes his horror crown back!!! fock them jason and freddy
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs not even being released on Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,These are mostly parts of all the Halloween movies made with different dialog. Don't know if I like it or hate it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like I‚Äôve seen this before...maybe even more than once.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Letsssss Gooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seriously üòê what the fudge cake is going on
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm kinda put off that the family connection was removed but I suppose Carpenter probably felt the concept had been too badly overused in previous films.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*wow Hallowen*
*superb*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will this be a flippy flop?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Literally goosebumps all over
ek1ePFp-nBI,*This gon' be goooooood*
ek1ePFp-nBI,remember when universal horror used to be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,How old is this nigga bro old ass 90 year serial killer and still buff asf how did his bones not go out
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, is this the first time a sequel has had exactly the same name as the original film?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally they went back to the original story line
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I started laughing when she couldn‚Äôt close the door, this will be the comedy of the year"
ek1ePFp-nBI,this will be meme‚Äôd like the it trailer i‚Äôm just wondering which part
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm never closing my closet door again! Thank you!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Regardless of how many reboots or remakes, or how many people are calling this trash already, people who are still fans of Halloween and Jamie Lee Curtis will STILL go see the movie. This movie will still rake in at the theater."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's the point of even watching this? It's obviously gonna suck..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pretty sure Jamie Lee killed the man by chopping his head off in H20!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccc$$$$ that
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessssssss!!!! I only have afew more months to wait! üòÄüòÄüòÉüòÉüòÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To quote a reboot that did it right, ""A true classic never goes out of style"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Never really a horror movie fan but man is the Halloween theme song so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They just won't let this shit die, will they?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That shit look good
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57 what is this Jurassic Park? XD i dont know anything about michael myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nope.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Honestly guys, at least it is a better trailer than The Predator."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will make over $50 million opening weekend
ek1ePFp-nBI,I fucking swear if this movie is pg-13
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/TT1an3PKq7s

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,No one gives a fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,I mean sure i guess?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As a kid, Halloween was the first and only horror movie that really scared me.

They really knew how to hold the audience in suspense back then. Not like the gore-fest bullshit they make today."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a horror fan so I'm most likely going to see this especially since Jamie Lee Curtis is back for nostalgia sake
ek1ePFp-nBI,Happy 40th anniversary Michael !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait to watch this right now
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wonder how they're going to address Michael's childhood home... Is it still standing, abandoned?  Has it been demolished or set on fire since 1978?  Has it become a landmark/museum?  Has the neighborhood been gentrified and Michael attacks whomever lives on the lot now?  These are questions that will surely be answered right before or when the film releases.  Comment below on your thoughts/ideas. #realandtruehalloweenfan"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This honestly looks like a original scary movie, none of this online based movies. This looks to be a OG slasher like how it used to be."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so ready for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yea been waiting on this shit.#1
ek1ePFp-nBI,Number one rule in horror movies: Never. EVER... be a baby sitter.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is in his late 60‚Äôs now
ek1ePFp-nBI,You just need a flashlight and decisive strike to beat him.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok first of all Jamie Lee Curtis died in the last one so explain how she's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hello Michael! :)

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yea!! Almost 6 million views un one day And counting!! Hell yeaüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh chit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Micheal is a beast. My partner is not a fan of horrors. I'm going to tell her we are going to watch something romantic at the cinemas and then, bam this bad boy is going to start up üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So another Halloween movie that will disregard all sequels, it is set after the events of the original. Not the first time they've done that. I don't think I'll bother with this one, it's gotten beyond pointless at this stage, they keep on killing him and he keeps on coming back. I like a good slasher film but this ran out of steam many films ago, and the idea that they're erasing everything after the first film story wise is just ridiculous."
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Rob Zombie in sight but with Jamie Lee Curtis! this could be a good Halloween remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ridiculous.  First off they have ignored all the others.  So I guess those were a waste of time.  They ignored bringing back Danielle Harris as Laurie Strodes daughter as she was introduced in Halloween 4.  In H2O, Danielle Harris character was completely cut out.  Now Laurie has completely different daughter here with a different name.  Hollywood listen, if you‚Äôre running out of ideas, don‚Äôt make stupid movies or movie remakes anymore!!!!!  They all suck!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OooOoOOOoOhhhhh Shiiiiittttttttt! üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait until the new Michael Myers movie to come out

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Feels good to have the franchise back in John  Carpenters hands even though he isn't directing, and to have Jamie Lee curtis reprising her Laurie Strode role."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know what I'm being for Halloween üòè
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice trailer but this better not be a fuckin remake. Rob zombie‚Äôs Halloween will always be the best Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't hear jackshit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/wO56H7dJrdk Check Out our music only üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,These trailers spoilers just get worse and worse with each movie... why can‚Äôt we just have a tease for once? Instead of a cliffnotes of the whole movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,My boiiii is back

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie is just awful, where is Freddy?! I was told this movie was gonna be a sequel to the movie ""Nightmare on Halloween street,"" But instead its just some crappy well made sequel to the Halloween franchise. 0/10 needs more Freddy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The goat
ek1ePFp-nBI,whos that old lady .... is that his sister?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's gonna suck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I sure hope Samuel Jackson is in this movie somewhere.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times can they bring back Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think I‚Äôm more scared of the lady than Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The original 1978 Michael is back!  OMG.  I can‚Äôt believe it!  Thank you, John Carpenter!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think since John Carpenter and the original team is doing this It will be the last one and a positive authoritative back story that was hinted at in Halloween one and two. Closure and results in the real world.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes. I can't wait to see it.

ek1ePFp-nBI,O hell naw
ek1ePFp-nBI,Almost üí© my pants in the last scene. I gave my sister my phone to watch to see if I was being dramatic. I wasn‚Äôt. She was scared too üòÇüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,For all those wondering she did not shoot Michael or a Imposter in the window that was merely Michaels reflection in a mirror.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don‚Äôt understand 

Cops shit Michel like 80 times and there were like 20 cops and that didn‚Äôt kill him

Then their lady thinks she can kill him with a rifle and a pistol"

ek1ePFp-nBI,So glad they brought jamie Lee Curtis back. I am too excited for this. Favorite horror movie franchise of all time besides Scream. üíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm now convinced that's a Mickey Rourke mask. Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is he fucking invincible in this one too?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This doesn't look very good. I hope I'm wrong though
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should've just left it alone after H20.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movies going to bomb .._
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this is really coming out. Jaime Curtis is still doing her thang!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 NOOT NOOT
ek1ePFp-nBI,*The Boogeyman is back...*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope I hope this comes out before the predator
ek1ePFp-nBI,@1:59 Anybody else notice the fat kid messes up his bump? LOL.  I like it though. The trailer gives way too much information for my liking but I like all the things I see. Laurie is basically the new Loomis. They explained away the brother connection. Nice tip of the hat to the eaten dog scene. Good stuff.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the original Michael in the original 1978 mask!  OMG!  I can‚Äôt wait!  The icon that started it all is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers in Mortal Kombat XI
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Every victim to be is shown in this trailer, no need for a movie then."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Uhhh...can anybody explain this timeline?

ek1ePFp-nBI,No thank u
ek1ePFp-nBI,What the fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if this is gunna fall into the Michael vs Freddy in 2020
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombies version will always be better than John carpenters but im still siked cause its halloween and ive been dying to see the remake finally happen so go hopefully they dont screw this up like they did the classics just my opinion guys no offense to everyone else.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do they keep using the same notes? Is it a Halloween Trailer or Jurassic Park/World? 1:07
ek1ePFp-nBI,sooo the old lady is his sister?
ek1ePFp-nBI,please god just let this hold up to the quality of the 2 first movies and I'll be more than happy. it CAN be done. I really belive it can be done.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Pleasedontbebadpleasedontbebadpkeasedontbebad
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like Rob Zombie did better they could have done a sequel to it for instance since Laurie is crazy at the end of new Halloween she could have escaped or something could be the next killer.... idk I guess it might be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,how long can they milk this shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whhhew Finally #1 in trending

ek1ePFp-nBI,Not scared not scared not scared AHHHHH IM SCARED
ek1ePFp-nBI,The night he comes home
ek1ePFp-nBI,The final battle
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so happy they have Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie still. Definitely a MUST SEE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Some people are so negative, don't see it if u don't want, piss off"
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/6VkBNm237UI
ek1ePFp-nBI,i thought he was killed in h20 tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,and another one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yo there really needs to be a good new slasher (instead of ghosts, ect). Nobody is making new ones even tho they are some of the most popular horror movies in the industry. Classics r great but like why keep remaking old ones, just come up w/ new ideas. (Still gonna watch this tho don‚Äôt get me wrong lol)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OHHHHHHH SHITTTTTTT 2O18 WE LIT BITCH. Does anybody else think they just keep remaking the same movies like Every 7 years ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""And has spent the last 40 years in captivity""....except after Laurie died in a car crash and he went after her daughter-wait! No, that never happend. He actually went after Laurie and her SON and then later dropped her off a building to her death-WAIT WAIT WAIT I mean NO she DEFINITELY didn't die two times! Forget all of that! Laurie Strode has ALWAYS BEEN ALIVE and has a daughter DUH!  Phew, don't know why that's so hard to understand, geesh.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times can you remake the same 5 horror movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trick or treat bitch
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Really hope Jamie is Laurie's daughter in this film and the granddaughter is Jamie's daughter who is just staying with Laurie for a little while. I know they are ignoring the films after the first one but they can still say Laurie had a daughter named Jamie, just that everything Jamie went through didn't exist. Jamie and Laurie were my favorite characters in the Halloween films."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fear in a Captain Kirk mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yawn.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am in!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can we just appreciate that the ORIGINAL MICHAEL in the ORIGINAL MASK is BACK with Jamie Lee Curtis.  Holy!  I was not expecting this.  OMG.  Can‚Äôt wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:00 i saw madelaine petsch in the car
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie is back people, and she is going to kick Michael's creepy ass!!üòé"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they can make another horror movie but not a sequel to Fight Club
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael you are my hero
ek1ePFp-nBI,jason next?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so confused I thought she was dead after she got stabbed at the mental hospital and fell from off the roff
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nothing will beat Rob's version of Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASSSSSS IMMA HELLA PUMPED üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,In the last 1 she chopped his head off..  and yet hes alive haha great movie tho i will watch this 1 aswell   halloween is a legend of a movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,All hail Michael Myers. Long live Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don‚Äôt be shit üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,at 1:29 you see the knife raised in the reflection of the pictures
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, looks like Blumhouse is going the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" route with this reboot. Only counting the original. Not even Halloween 2. Are you fucking kidding me...

Edit: Actually, with my initial reaction residing, I guess this is the best way they could have brought back Halloween. They're smart enough to realize they shouldn't just remake the first one(again). Also, if this new movie did count Halloween 2, it be rather hard to explain(realistically) how Michael Myers regained his eyesight by being shot in both his eyesockets. Halloween 4 kinda bypassed that detail."
ek1ePFp-nBI,IT'S FUCKING HAPPENING
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssssssssssssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I would love it if you took a moment to check out my GoFundMe campaign:

ek1ePFp-nBI,So there not acknowledging the others movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh give me a break. Not another Halloween movie. Can't these lazy brain dead twits come up with an original idea?
ek1ePFp-nBI,HA! GaaaaaYyy
ek1ePFp-nBI,i love halloween!!! can't wait for this~
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The person who made this trailer is a GENIUS .Teases us  enough to get us excited, but without giving away too much.This is how a good trailer is done.Bravo .Plus quick fact. I was born in 1978 when the original Halloween came out."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Daddy's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason Voorhees for life Michael Myers sucks
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:35 I can already see a hey vsauce Michael here meme
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looked good up until that last part. That was a little forced and terribly paced, maybe they trimmed it down for the trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love the micheal myers song.. takes me baaaaack
ek1ePFp-nBI,The kid that said ‚ÄúDad look out‚Äù was in the my drama 2 class last semester. He was the best one in the class but hated doing Shakespeare monologues
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Everything wrong with Halloween:

taunting michael with his mask.
Investigating a case 40 years later? For what?
Telling us michael is not her bro.
Basically telling us were all stupid.
Laurie is now rambo.
Michael is now jason.
Laurie. Why a gun when u can swing a sword?
Typical bus crash..and..escape.
The old closet trick.
Anything else??"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where‚Äôs the skull trooper?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait a minute.  Laurie Strode was outright killed in one of the films.  She traps Michael by hanging him over a building.  Tries to hang the guy.  Michael Grabs her, stabs her and then throws her off a 4 story building to her death.  Just watched the rest of the trailer.  Total shit.  And what is up with the old fart mask he's wearing?  John Carpenter is not directing or producing the film.  He didn't write the script.    He's just doing the music.  This film is doomed."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too many liberal freaks in this. I'll pass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Did I just heard the Jurassic Park SoundTrack?*
ek1ePFp-nBI,3 words: NICK. FUCKING. CASTLE. ü§©ü§©ü§©

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait... where‚Äôs the scene with the dead horse üêé?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Old school slasher flims are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than that Bullshit ass supernatural movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damnnnnn this preview had me jumping üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,Been waiting for this üòç hopefully it's not trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im more excited at Jamie Lee Curtis coming back to this
ek1ePFp-nBI,PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF LOOMIS BE GOOD!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Funny how they didn't show a rating

Just a heads up: if it isn't rated R it's gonna be trash"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Y E S
ek1ePFp-nBI,Esto promete cremita de la buena ;)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just tell me which halloween movies this movie just threw out the window so i can know whats going on
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm confused clearly this movie acknowledges Halloween 1 and 2 and skips 4,5,6 and probably 8 but are we pretending like H2O never happened also?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,All we need is a new Friday the 13th now!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:35 Quit hitting me in the face Susan
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis with a gun is going to be the scariest part of this movie. This bat-shit crazy grandmother role she's taken on makes me want to rip my dick off and throw it at my monitor!
ek1ePFp-nBI,la vie de J√©sus
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is Michael immortal or a zombie or something?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Master is back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2T41d6NNoQ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can they just stay dead already
ek1ePFp-nBI,So another remake of a remake...  Hollywood is completely out of original ideas..
ek1ePFp-nBI,So h20 and after that didn't happened??whyy?
ek1ePFp-nBI,You need to make a Michael VS Jason VS Freddy that would be Epic BATTLE !! TRIPLE THREAT MATCHüî•ü§ò
ek1ePFp-nBI,And then we wonder why white boys go shooting up schools when you have movies like this if you are under 25 you can be impressionable by these kind of movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:49 michael is now confirmed bald
ek1ePFp-nBI,So... it's just a guy posing as Myres? Aw...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"SMH, When will these stupid movie series end?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait to watch it, hopefully it's not garbage, though it may never be as good as the original, it better be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie died in Resurrection? This makes no sense
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:25  That was comical how she kept slamming the door in to Michaels face üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seeing this for my birthday October 23 yay
ek1ePFp-nBI,A failing movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,H20 and Halloween 2 never happened?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Evil begets evil...only one thing can stop Michael, and that's Jason!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie will fail
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie is such a queen!  I'm so ready for Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtf when i saw the trailer to this movie about my favorite killer i am so ready to see it again after i watched it in the movie theaters back when i was a little girl
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks like a John Carpenter movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2018 is an amazing year for movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt waitüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just feel confident this about this movie being good. I love Blumhouse productions for the movies ever since ‚ÄúHush‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,"idk about this one, i heard there was gonna be another Halloween in 8th grade with an unconfirmed date, now im about to be a junior hopefully this movie is good, i don't expect it to be perfect, i hope the screen time for Michael is worth watching instead of kills that are anti climatic, i have decently high hopes for this movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe the success of this film will prompt studios to greenlight future Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street or Scream films"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES BITCH
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm praying that this will be even better than this trailer and they‚Äôve not revealed too much. Watched the originals hundreds of times and I have waited years for this. I‚Äôm so excited but I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll be everything I‚Äôve expected and more.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"On another level, I‚Äôm okay with Jamie Lee Curtis being the main protagonist in the Halloween movie because she was always a fighter even in the original one, nowadays everything feels like it‚Äôs being SJW washed but this right here, feels like it‚Äôs hitting home and I love it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,But didn't Jamie Lee's character die??? I'm so confused.
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should make a meme where she just constantly tries to close the door by it repeating

It can also to make uncanon all those tons of uninspired, unneeded and useless cash in cow sequels. Think of what they could do with Robocop or TMNT, at one point, as sort of a legacy sequel, like Rambo etc. It depends, though."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael was always my favorite. The way he would kill you crush you or pin you on the wall and stare tilting his head like he doesn't understand death.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah bitch
ek1ePFp-nBI,MIKE MYERS IS BACK
ek1ePFp-nBI,AAAAHH the teeth thing had me so unsettled Dx
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After ghost busters, terminator Genesis, Starwars 7/8/solo, and Pirates of the Caribbean 5, I've grown tired of getting hyped up for remakes/late sequels that only end up being trash.

At this point I'm just going in with the expectation for this to be very shitty."
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Michael Myers  join the server*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Forget that, im buying my own candy"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not trying to be nasty but i wish they put the mask on Jamie Lee Curtis, man she got ugly real quick."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.-Dr samuel Loomis R.I.P Donald Pleasance"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Welcome back, Mr. Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah!!ü§òüèª
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are they getting the same actors
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The real question is: will we actually get to see his face this time? 

But for reals though, as a fan of the original, I am very excited for this movie! I hope they do it justice and make it good, instead of what that Zombie guy gave us."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is looking rough these days.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many of these movies are just called Halloween? It must get confusing at this point
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:28 me closing the fridge door when a item of food or drink bottle blocks the doorüôÉ

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this Michael Myers going to be very tall like he was in the Rob Zombie Halloween movies?

ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years later. We get this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can someone please explain to me why are they making another Halloween film? Don't get me wrong, I am an ethusiastic fan of slasher goosebumps-on-skin horror films, but does Hollywood need to construct another Halloween movie? Like, c'mon already!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie was being filmed back in like January at my school in South Carolina. The place at 0:27 is on the way to school for me and Haddonfield high was also filmed on my way to school. Some people in my grade were cast as extras, which is pretty cool.

ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks great.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the creative titles
ek1ePFp-nBI,Solution if Michael Myers escapes: Buy everyone in your house a handgun. I saw like 30 places where they could have gunned the bastard down.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this going to be a bad ass mike myers movie or a shitty wanna be mike myers movie? at the moment the trailer looks good.üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks ok-ish
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael shouldn't be in the light so often it makes him less scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How old is Michael Meyer? I know he is technically timeless, but really...¬† Is he 70?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck yes

ek1ePFp-nBI,Just get John wick and you‚Äôll be ok
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just watch Halloween the first one and ignore the sequels 3 to 6 and Ressurection

The True Finales are Halloween 20 Years Later, 2 and THIS"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How is it people in these horror movies, where the villain is mortal, don't just f*** them up? You're telling me, in all those homes, no one has ANY kinda weapons.....or are they all dumb enough to keep dropping them? Here's a tip....if by the end the villain is captured, use everything you have to turn them into pasty bits."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When are they going to stop making these movies, holy fuck."
ek1ePFp-nBI,its like the purge
ek1ePFp-nBI,my baby boo michal myers is back  i have been waiting for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope he kills everyone of those annoying film crew ppl for taunting him with the mask. That bathroom scene was already done in H20 so not original unless it was just to pay tribute
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can‚Äôt wait for the fucking 3rd remake of the movie that had so many sequels to begin with, can you guys just give these movies a rest"

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is stupid you know?because Jamie Lee Curtis in the old Halloween movie she chopped his head off with a fire axe.So you tell me how did he attach his head back together? or how can he still be alive when he got his head chopped off?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, I just farted and this movie looks awesome dude. Still stinks doh."

ek1ePFp-nBI,So exited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Whether this movie turns out to be a disappointment or not, I'm still excited for the return (again) of this horror classic."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"John Carpenter said he started all over for the sake of quality over quantity. He admitted that the numerous sequels got out of hand. He never intended for Michael to become a supernatural demon, but purely evil psychopath killer, who was mysterious. That's what made him terrifying.
Me personally, I'm excited. I hope it'll turn out good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,No thanks
ek1ePFp-nBI,That‚Äôs what they get for showing him that damned mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like it's going back to its roots but adding some thing new to the mix, should make for a interesting Halloween."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This bitch talking about how long she's been waiting to kill Michael.






She don't even know long i've been waiting for a new Halloween."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt fucking wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57 Since when does an all-white neighborhood have boba teas
ek1ePFp-nBI,So chopping his head off with an Axe didn't kill him?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder what Michael looks like without the mask in thus film and if we'll get to see a unmasked scene like at the end of the original one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finnaly!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anyone else think that the closet scene was so PREDICTABLE?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This make no sense Lori died
ek1ePFp-nBI,They haven‚Äôt caught this guy yet?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why does michael look bald in the asylum but when he headbutts the door he has loads of hair??

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This trailer makes no damn sense all. Myers has been locked for the last 40 years since 1978? Total rubbish. So they're just going to disregard all the other Halloween movies that came after that? Again, makes no sense."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lmfao...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still not as scary as a Latina when she‚Äôs mad.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good lord! How many times can they remake this nonsense?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally it's back hope it be better
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Around 0:43 - 0:50 it sounded like someone was agressively jacking off, lol."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whew! I thought Justin Y. was here. So glad he isnt.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm hella hyped for this movie now. Even if it doesn't turn out amazing, I still love it for the sake of nostalgia. When I heard the Halloween Theme start playing I got so excited. All the horror movies I've seen lately are supernatural, which is fine, but it's getting old and repetitive. Gotta bring back some classic slashers to help refresh the horror industry. Hopefully this movie will spark some new and creative ideas down the line."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt stop watching
ek1ePFp-nBI,So are H20 and it‚Äôs sequels no longer canon? I‚Äôm pretty sure he overkilled Laurie aka Jamie lee Curtis in that last one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:05 why is laurie daughter wearing a Christmas sweater?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks really fuckin good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love him!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now I want them to re-make Friday the 13th and A Nightmare On Elmstreet and go off of what happened in the first flims
ek1ePFp-nBI,4 decades since the first movie. I guess her granddaughter must be her son daughter. She did have another grandson from her daughter in one of the Halloween movies. It was the last one the doctor appeared in before the actor died in real life. He would be In his early 20's now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Perfect
ek1ePFp-nBI,No black people?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like this won't be scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If they aren't treating Season of the Witch as canon, then they can go pound sand."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Perfect flick to rub one out to
ek1ePFp-nBI,Instant chills with original music score.  I'm sold.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now *this* looks much better than those sequels/remakes! It's less of a survival thing and more like the movie _Elle_.
ek1ePFp-nBI,She is really taunting this dude michael like she is a beast
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait a minute! She said this time is different bc she is going to kill him? What the hell was she doing in the last several films? Conserving her ammo for that 6 shooter revolver?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis‚Äô character is now like Sarah Connor from Terminator 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:48 When you gotta shit real bad but someone is already in the stall
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just like IT this looks awesome not scary.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers vs Sarah Conner? Hopefully the feminist agenda won't be too obnoxious.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish that old lady was my grandma
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't be the only person who roots for Michael Myers

ek1ePFp-nBI,":42  If the patients are chained up at a single point on the board, then a circle would be the best way to describe their reach and range of movement, because we live in a Euclidean universe.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks exciting :)) jamie lee curtis is that woman always was and always will be

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So apparently from what I was told, this is the sequel ONLY to the original Halloween film. and that the reason it isn‚Äôt following the 2nd film is because H2 made them siblings. 

So now they‚Äôre not related?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg leave Michael Myers alone  they put him in an institution for 40 years now they wanna pick on him and start some shit...

ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been waiting for this trailer since I heard that Halloween movie will be released this halloween. And now I'm waiting for The Nun trailer .
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm just having a hard time giving a shit. What exactly is the point of this movie? It appears to have nothing to add to the franchise. I'll give it a shot I guess, but so far, meh."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If it wasn't for IT, i would be totally against this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I, seriously, flinched when she opened the closet door and Michael was right there..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So the events of Halloween 2 didn't happen either in this one? I'm so confused.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes! Michael is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait to watch.üéÉüëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,I literally got chills. I'm so excited for this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hehehe YOU BETTER RUN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh this is what they were talking about in baby driver
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéÉüî™

ek1ePFp-nBI,Who‚Äôs watching in 2019????
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh good my brothers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cool, another sjw movie where the old ass grandma is a kick ass killer and ready to kill MICHAEL FUCKING MYERS. Fuck off this movie looks fucking retarded"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So what is happening? Michael and Laurie are NOT related now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,How funny would it be if Jim Carey was  playing the crazy brother Michael? üòÇ I mean c'mon now. Just a thought.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back home. 2:10 Family Reunion.
ek1ePFp-nBI,More remakes. Great.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,how did Lori survive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow üëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,The teeth part was awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can Star Wars take note of the powerful female lead actress please and stop insulting the fans!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,oooohh Yes.... Mike gets to put on that William Shatner mask once again..!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,I am the biggest michael myers fan. I hope he is not talking. I can't wait though. Yessssss.......
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hopefully they don't show his eyes behind the mask.  Kills it for me.  Hell of a lot more creepy when they are black, and emotionless."
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"my best movie off all time ,thank you john carpenter for your great talent and also for hearing the Halloween fans for one more scare ,you are the greatest"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Run Michael! she didn't have her Activia this morning
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess getting stabbed and falling 30 feet wasn't enough for her to die.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie did it better
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rated G for General Audiences.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought she died in one of the movie series üòÖüòûüòÑüò≠üòÇ  when he was hanging the she did the worst mistake of trying to take off his mask then BAMMM! girrrrrl you dead with that knife you had in your hand that you could have used on him, better yet call the cops BOOM wait till they get a little close, stab Mikey cause you know know he's gonna escape so you gotta stop the sequel from ever happening right?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to watch how the survivors will pallet loop myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not gonna lie........i am looking forward to this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I knew there was a reason I avoid public restrooms at all costs!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"why am i watching this so late at night...
the last scene freaked me out"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be litüî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I liked the family angle and I even liked the Rob Zombie versions of the movies, no doubt that makes me a terrible fan of the original first movie but oh well."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope to see this trailer on TV towards the fall and October so I can hear the creepy ass music üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow amazing videos!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Have you ever wondered why you force yourself to watch shit like this at 3 am and then wonder why you cant sleep?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus Christ, the audio editing in this is horse shit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is fucking back... *AGAIN. FOR LIKE THE 8'TH TIME*
ek1ePFp-nBI,wait i thought Michael killed Lori years ago am i wrong??

ek1ePFp-nBI,This makes me feel like I'm living in 1978
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love him in Dead by Daylight! :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,This one looks good honestly. Hope it's not like the crappy sequels
ek1ePFp-nBI,He reminds me of my brother in law üòÇü§£ scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,A lot seems to be happening here
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yasssssss Jamie Lee Curtis
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks awful lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,is michael immortal what a bullshit faggetry is this
ek1ePFp-nBI,So hes NOT her brother? Huh?
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's waited for this night...he's waited for me and I've waited for him!...Such spine tingling words....such a iconic horror franchise!:)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sweet
ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny McBride?? 2:40

ek1ePFp-nBI,Shit grandma is a bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kill Michael then kill the cunt on that piano
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back YES got to go see this üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,That‚Äôs not Michaels head slamming into the door in the bathroom it‚Äôs the British reporter guy. I‚Äôm assuming as soon as Michael comes in the bathroom and goes to her cubicle he comes rushing in over seeing the mechanic dead and then Michael kills him and drops his teeth. Hate when trailers try and make it look like some characters play a bigger part but in reality the scenes of him talking to Laurie is  before he goes to the asylum
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôd watch dat
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fan service and no real scares, I think. Interesting moment that they scrapped all the sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watch out for da boogie man bitch
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this is the 3rd movie thats just called ""Halloween""?! 


This shit is confusing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,That bo3 zombies music doe
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks heavy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:49

You can kind of see his face, little blurry and bloody but I guess this is kind of an unmask.


edit: I'm dumb aren't I? That's not michael myers is it?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh my fucking God, they're doing this again yaaaaaayyy and I thought it was over too"
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should‚Äôve made it come out on Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If I was that bitch I'll just move away as far as possible, like Brazil oh France. And not just waking for him to stab me in my ass"
ek1ePFp-nBI,no Rob Zombies were involved in the making of this film
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Halloween Resurrection isn't canon anymore?
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 on trending!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is super progressive Michael Myers is the first major movie killer to come out of the closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can we just have a slasher cinematic universe already? With chucky freddy Jason and myers

ek1ePFp-nBI,Most iconic horror franchise to date....I'm sure this film will be a massive hit within the first week of its release!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I had a walk on part in this film. I walked on in the mask - that's me. If i'd known they were going to center the whole film around me I would have asked for more than $40. I thought I was doing a lot on the day.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just hope to God this starts having r  Rated horror movies again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait

ek1ePFp-nBI,damn
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm ready to watch this movie Halloween was the greatest movie of all time I think this is going to be the best one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hate when they cant come up with a decent sequel subtitle... it's ""HALLOWEEN"", THEN ""HALLOWEEN II"", THEN ""HALLOWEEN"" ? come the fuck on!(since they seemingly RETCONNED everything after part2) 
Halloween. Halloween II.... Maybe HALLOWEEN all caps?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit






Nope no more Halloween"

ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YESSSS!!!1
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times are they gonna drain this story. It's like a remake mixed with an original mixed with a sequel. Confusing

ek1ePFp-nBI,üíÉüòÇüëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sub to my channel plz
ek1ePFp-nBI,It has to be a remake because Jamie lee died in the movie before the one with busta rhymes

ek1ePFp-nBI,.....oh yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Something tells me a 60+ year old Michael Myers is going to be the most depraved version weve ever seen...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whats ironic is that this movie comes out on October 19. Which is not on Halloween.....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh cool another Halloween movie...how...original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,No freaking way....love gotta see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i love the original Halloween. i had high hopes for this, but if i had to judge by this trailer, id say it looks really lame."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is it bad that I‚Äôm way more excited for Halloween than The Walking Dead this year? If you would‚Äôve asked me 16 years ago after Halloween: Resurrection we would see another Halloween film with Jamie Lee Curtis back in her iconic role Laurie Strode back on the screen facing off with Michael Myers, I would‚Äôve thought you were crazy. Thank God they‚Äôre ignoring all the sequels after John Carpenter‚Äôs horror classic. I‚Äôm so ready for this film"
ek1ePFp-nBI,yes kick nuts
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't normally like movies being milked but this one seems pretty good. Just weird that there is actually some badass elder lady in horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,And another one
ek1ePFp-nBI,*OH YEAH* . Michael is back Baby.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:25 - 0:30. So they just gonna ignore all the bad sequals and remakes? lol good move
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be stupid how many time did Michael die in this movies so far
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeaaa.... now my closet will be forever openüëπ

ek1ePFp-nBI,didn't they kill her off a few terrible sequels ago? also why no tit shots?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Y'all mother fucks ran out of ideas lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"THIS is the way to do it, just ignore all the damn crappy sequels and pick the story up right after the original. They've talked about doing this with the Alien franchise too and picking it up after part 2, bringing back Hicks and Newt, but sadly it sounds like it's not going to happen. That said if this is a big success and in light of the fact that there ISN'T going to be a sequel to Covenant, perhaps they'll reconsider. 

RIP Donald Pleasence, I wish he was still around to play Loomis."

For the invisible things of him 
from the creation of the world 
are clearly seen, 


being understood 
by the things that are made, 


even his eternal power 
and Godhead; 


so that they 


are without excuse:


(Romans 1:18-20).


***Having departed from godliness and righteousness, people suppress the truth about God: 

That God is their loving Creator and deserves their worship and praise. 

Sinful people can mentally perceive the revealed truth of God, but they chosen to suppress it. 

They are without excuse.
Gods anger is being revealed 

against sin and the suppression of the truth. 


***(What may be known of God): Not only are divine attributes clearly seen in humanity, but they can be seen in the material universe as well.


***Nature itself speaks eloquently of its Creator. From the intricate design of the human cell to the majestic strength of the Rock Mountains, all God's works testify to his wisdom and power. 


***God's invisible attributes, such as his eternal power and Godhead, meaning his divine nature, can be clearly seen by contemplating his awesome works in all of creation. 


***And then shall that Wicked one/Anti-Christ be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they (received not) the (love of the truth), that they (might be saved). And for this cause (God) (shall send them) (strong delusion), that (they) (should believe a lie): That they all might be damned who (believed not the truth), but had (pleasure) in (unrighteousness). (2 Thessalonians 2:8-12). 


***Giving ungodly/wicked people up to the Anti-Christ is God's wrath on unrighteous people who dwell on this earth, who rather live in Sin and transgress against God's law, then to live Godly lives and serve and worship the Creator, who created them."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn jaime looking like shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just what we needed, another sequel"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lame
ek1ePFp-nBI,the best Halloween theme song and movie of all timesüëåüëåüëåüëåüîõüîù

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be lit been waiting for this forever
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael ! Can‚Äôt wait !
ek1ePFp-nBI,In your face symbolism.......What's up with the red and white masonic checkerboard floor in the asylum? Checkerboard symbolism (black and white) represents duality and change in consciousness which is a type of monarch mind control (MK ultra). The red and white tyle is a symbol of blood sacrifice.  Possible plot point?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So if Michael's been locked up for the past 40 years (since the original Halloween killings of 1978), does this mean all of the Halloween sequels that followed the original never happened?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blum house is so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like the making of a classic
ek1ePFp-nBI,Take all my money!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is he ever gonna die?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they explain how he survived five/six shots to the chest.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just a little confused here. How old is Micheal here? Should he not be retired or something?? Is he still as strong as he was due to being put away for soo long??
ek1ePFp-nBI,If i am correct michael escaped many times in all of the movies except the 3rd please someone correct me on this if this is not true
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nostalgia

ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been waiting for him?‚Äù Sis we‚Äôve been waiting for y‚Äôall.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excited to see this movie since it will have Jamie Lee Curtis in it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Box office bomb
ek1ePFp-nBI,"#UniversalPictures could you consider adding Closed captions for this and other trailers? Going to the movies is hard enough if you are deaf or hard of hearing, but not having captions for the trailer online is pretty annoying as well. I can't enjoy the trailer as much because I do not know what is being said, and with movies like this that is kind of important!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My last name is Myers , I loved the Halloween series so much as a kid I use to tell people at school we were cousins all the time üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back baby!
ek1ePFp-nBI,#stopmakingremademovie

ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's fucking goooooooo!
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/3vGczDVHOO4
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm gonna enjoy this for what it is because I love Halloween, but John carpenter would hate this. They're basically taking his original concept of this eerie, hyper focused killing machine and they're making him into this unnecessarily violent mental patient. Carpenter didn't even want to make the original Halloween 2 because adding to Michael's back story gave him motivation which stripped away the original thing that made him scary and unsettling: that there was no clear reason for his killing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if he‚Äôll actually die this time
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh great another halloween H20 lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,michael vs jason?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yea yeah!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next is Jason üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,My mom with the chancla and my dad with the belt is still scarier than this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope better than Mr. Zombie version
ek1ePFp-nBI,"|  ||
|| |_"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope carpenter doesn‚Äôt screw this up...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This shit looks BORING. Too generic, they should just let this franchise die out already instead of milking it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was I the only one who actually liked rob zombies vision of Halloween.. I thought it was actually terrifying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG CANT WAIT!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it's kind of a remake of H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus Christ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this film scary cuz I‚Äôm not sure is it like Annabelle and those types of horror films or is it like nightmare on elm street we‚Äôre it isn‚Äôt that scary but more of a thriller
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANT  WAIT AND CARPENTER INVOLVED MEANS  TRUE HALOWEEN ..
ek1ePFp-nBI,H20 was a great movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wanna see dat
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dream is to break 100k amazing subscribers goal this year which will be hard :/
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""You should"" is the most predictable line I've ever heard in a trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They ran that Halloween movie franchise in the ground. Let it die & move on already.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Didn‚Äôt he get shot in the head in the last movie? This don‚Äôt make sense , anyone care to explain?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS LIKE THE THIRD MOVIE THEY CALLIN HALLOWEEN JUST CALL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG OMG IM GONNA SHIT MYSELF WHEN I WATCH THIS BUT IT WILL BE WORTH IT THANK YOU
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original music and stinger effects go a long way to making the trailer effective and making it feel like a Halloween movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,why do i laugh at horror movies lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,haHAA scary movie guys 12btw
ek1ePFp-nBI,STOP REMAKING THIS DAMN MOVIE JESUS CHRIST WHAT IS THIS? THE FIFTH TIME ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSS FINALY !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In real life prisoners cant escape that easy from the bus. If they did, there will me an enormous man hunt. Just call the swat team and surround Micheal. I just hate how in every scary movie someone has to do something so dumb lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can we please have Jason vs Michael universal  please!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aye bruh you ain‚Äôt to busy right now since u reading the commment section... so y‚Äôall go fuck wit my YouTube channel I got this new video up and it go hard üòÇ‚ò†Ô∏è oh yea check out my vlogs too ..like and spread the word üòÇüòÇ‚ò†Ô∏è good looks my nigga

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good. Can‚Äôt wait

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks sooooo gooodd
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow I'm impressed, this actually looks good

So... can we get a new Friday the 13th next"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too many reboots
ek1ePFp-nBI,But in the last movie f the series she chopped off his head. Also Jamie looking old (not to be rude) and Jamie's character is supposed to be 12 years younger than Michael . He supposed to be dead and old.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I keep rewatching this üò§üò§
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welp...all of the other movies aren't cannon now.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Millenials will never know
ek1ePFp-nBI,Haluk Bilginer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 i can only think of black ops zombies (the song)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôve been waiting for another Halloween movie, and now it‚Äôs finally happening and I can‚Äôt help but be overly excited. üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombies was pinnacle Halloween. This won't even come close

ek1ePFp-nBI,MY BODY IS READY!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ill probably fall asleep to this one as well, since the original was a slow moving piece of dated crap."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Even tho the original always beats the remake I'm still hyped to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Betcha I can beat him in a fist fight lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis has been terrorizing her brother for decades. Poor Michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,So when the fuck does this take place? Because Laurie Strode is dead....
ek1ePFp-nBI,AHHHHHH YESSS

ek1ePFp-nBI,Why didn‚Äôt they execute him none of this would‚Äôve happened
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers >>>>> Jason Voorhes
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was hoping for a new shrek movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well I just pissed myself üôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,So if they're changing the lore where they're not siblings then can anyone tell me why Michael would still be obsessed with killing her?
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't touch hereditary
ek1ePFp-nBI,Call Jhon wick!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now THIS is what I want to see in a horror movie. The female character is the one who understands the severity of the situation, planned accordingly, and is the one trying to educate some dumb teenage fuckers just how doomed they are."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I Just create my Channel at Brazil...I,m  humbly ask a help to increase my firsts views...if you can help me.. God Bless you"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sign me up
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so ready for this to come
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Honestly this film is gonna make tons of money basically more than a quiet place, I'm not a huge Halloween fan I've only seen the first one but I'm there day one üî™üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I real life need to c this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"STOP WITH THE FUCKIN REMAKES AND CONTINUATION OF CLASSICS!!! MY GOD, HOLLYWOOD WILL NEVER GIVE UP, WILL THEY?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When the piano hits, you know shit gets mad serious"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How come he never ends up in New York where people aren‚Äôt vulnerable or the hood
ek1ePFp-nBI,i thought Jamie lee curtis' character was killed by her brother? and Michael is in prison? how many times will they continue to make this film? i dont know what else to say or think tbh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Subscribe to iuic. Only Esau can up with movies like these Habakkuk 2:4. Type iuic the slave trade
ek1ePFp-nBI,Weak

ek1ePFp-nBI,BITCH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a real original horror.. the king of halloween is back !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That last scene with myers in the closet will not be put in the movie. They just put it in the trailer so when the time comes that you watch the movie, you‚Äôll think you‚Äôll know hes in there when hes really not. Just like in the trailer of ‚Äúget out‚Äù with that skeleton face of an animal was not actually put in the movie. That was just a fun fact for yall :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How is it possible though? Did he get head sewn back on? Please help me out someone.üòÜ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Why rating will this film be?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 using headbutt to open the door. Nice!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got the chills.
ek1ePFp-nBI,There is no more originality in Hollywood.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse what the hell are you doing on this one??
ek1ePFp-nBI,They So make friday the 13th and halloween movie called Jason vs Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So they‚Äôre ignoring all the other sequels except 1 and 2, that‚Äôs a good idea because all the other sequels were good but made no sense"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm far behind. I still need to finish the first movie. :O
*This looks good btw. A colossal brawl between brother and sister.*"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Good old Michael myres
ek1ePFp-nBI,This one is good.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Be honest, when the Halloween music comes on, you bob your head too."
ek1ePFp-nBI,AhhhWoW
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why?
ek1ePFp-nBI,wowwwwww
ek1ePFp-nBI,Universal studios dark universe confirmed
ek1ePFp-nBI,I had the original on VHS recorded from tv when I was a kid. Best horror film ever! Nice to see they are erasing all the shit films that followed after Halloween 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,None of this would have happened if they just killed him
ek1ePFp-nBI,ÔΩâ„ÄÄÔΩìÔΩàÔΩèÔΩî„ÄÄÔΩàÔΩâÔΩç„ÄÄÔΩìÔΩâÔΩò„ÄÄÔΩîÔΩâÔΩçÔΩÖÔΩì
ek1ePFp-nBI,This guy killed 3 stupid teenagers back in the 70s. Let it go already dude.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey, what can I say it looks pretty interesting. Have seen all, and this is pretty outside the box. The only thing is the teenagers. Why???"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I....cant....wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,I mean let‚Äôs all admit it this looks stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is my favorite movie ever! I can‚Äôt wait for this! üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,seems cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes I've been waiting for this for so longggg now the Boogeyman has come back to kill all the babysitters... And Laurie Strode but she's probably gonna kill him... Or not
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell yes i can not wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,WOWOWOWWWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWWOWOWOWOWO. They should make a Jason vs Micheal myers movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes he can be in the new MK game as DLC!
ek1ePFp-nBI,For real.... again? Hmmm i wonder what the storyinez gna be????
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:02 be careful he is in tier 3 guys
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks f**king awesome!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to show him the mask xd
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie finna go so crazy
ek1ePFp-nBI,What the hell did you do that for?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wouldve just start banging the door on that ladt scene
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this another reboot or continuation from the original series? If this is yet another reboot Hollywood needs some new ideas instead of leaching success with the name.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope this doesn‚Äôt flop
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have to See this filmüëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music does it for me eek!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks ok but wouldn‚Äôt Michael be around 70 now? Just doesn‚Äôt seem as scary. Tim Burton should do a Freddy remake. That would be a dream
ek1ePFp-nBI,We need a Freddy vs Jason part 2 cuz no one actually won
ek1ePFp-nBI,William Shatner isn't scary.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is stupid is Michael is a mortal. Jason Vorheese is immortal. Jason came back from the grave in part 6. But Halloween does nothing to make it believable. Then Strodes aint killed him yet. What makes her think she can kill him 40 years later? Just dumb movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,All they need to do is get holy water and splash it on him boom problem solved
ek1ePFp-nBI,so halloween 2 never happened? that sucks because that ones my favourite this looks awesome tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well...now we don't have to see it.
Thanks a lot 'movie trailer'. 
Lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's about damn time they got Michael backüòÅüòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie is going to mark my first time watching a Halloween movie in theaters, since I wasn't old enough to see them, or I wasn't born yet."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Again?
Really?
What happened to creativity and originality? Hollywood use to be great at bringing us entertaining, FRESH & NEW stuff. Look back at all the all time great characters and stories they've brought us.
Now....
Its all about remakes and sequels. Nothing is new anymore. They're just recreating old stories and maybe adding a bit of a twist but everything from TV to Movies is remakes.
Let's do something new."
ek1ePFp-nBI,My childhood is backkkkkkkk
ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogie mans John Wick tho.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many people thought Michael was dead for good?
ek1ePFp-nBI,a queen
ek1ePFp-nBI,Make'em say uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,My life is now whole again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn... this doesn‚Äôt look half bad actually. Had no idea Jamie Lee Curtis was reprising her role. üëåüèªüò¨üòÄ

ek1ePFp-nBI,hes back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Im in my 40s and Michael, Jason, Freddy, and Pin Head are dead to me. Please just make a new monster. You ruin the movies by retelling and changing crap. Not interested. And the Phantom of the Opra had the first white mask in any horror film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by daylight anyone?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Old school horror is always better than stupid new generation jump scare cgi ghost crap
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Old school horror vibes...

This might actually be a horror movie worth watching."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs About To Go Down

This movie wouldn't exist if it weren't for director rivalry... lol to all the dumb fucks that bash Rob's movies...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:49 pause it.

ek1ePFp-nBI,#timephonehack # stopthesacrifice
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis has been calling for the gun disarming of law abiding citizen and yet she uses guns in this movie to defend herself from a killer. Hypocrite. Her character was killed off in Halloween: Resurrection. Should've just left her dead. It's time for something new instead of the same old Michael Myers trying to kill Laurie strode story. Enough of that already.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the definition of a horror movie

Who would win?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES FINALLY SOME GOOD HORROR FUCK DEATH DAY

ek1ePFp-nBI,so basically like the original part 2.. hmm I wish they'd come out wit a good horror movie & stop remaking them
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:45 THE BEST PART
ek1ePFp-nBI,What movie should I watch before I watch this one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, I'm gonna think of this as an alternate timeline where Laurie wasn't related to Michael and the things after the first film didn't happen; however, I feel like it weakens Laurie's motivation to kill Michael. It's not that Laurie wasn't traumatized in the first film but the original timeline Laurie went through hell 1000 times worse if you compare it to this Laurie who only got a few of her friends killed. I don't know, I just feel like the original Laurie deserved to kill Michael and not die the way she did."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please don't be shit, please don't be shit.




Please don't be over hyped shit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Eh it‚Äôs okay

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Tries to close closet, michael so fat it won't close"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit I just remembered that Jamie Lee Curtis was from the very first Halloween movie. I thought this was a continuation of the Rob Zombie movies with a different director
ek1ePFp-nBI,Any DBD fans here
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this bitch must be the last gunslinger alive.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie is prepared. She has Decisive Strike now. Michael will quit

ek1ePFp-nBI,"My name is Dr. William Ferraiolo. I have twenty five years of experience teaching, researching, and publishing articles in academic journals. I have authored a book which contains a collection of meditations in the Stoic tradition that I believe would be an excellent addition to your library (or your own reading material). This collection is unique in that each meditation is presented in the second person, encouraging the reader to examine their struggles and failures in the pursuit of self-improvement and enlightenment. The following is a sample meditation that illustrates this:

‚ÄúEverything that can suffer, does suffer. Everything that can die, will die. You have suffered, you will suffer much more, and a lifetime of your suffering will culminate in your death. When you can muster genuine gratitude for all of that, then you will have made the kind of progress that is not easily reversed. To develop sincere appreciation for this opportunity to be born in a brutal world, not of your making, to struggle and fail time and time again, to feel repeatedly lost, bewildered, frustrated, and hopeless, to swim in this ocean of misery, and, ultimately, to drown in it‚Äîthis is the beginning of wisdom. You must embodyoverwhelming gratitude for the opportunity to fail repeatedly, with no guarantee of eventual success, and to wade cheerfully into a doomed struggle against time and your own limitations. You clamber toward your own death across a landscape of thorns, broken glass, and the corpses of those who have gone before you. Would you have it any other way?‚Äù

ek1ePFp-nBI,Ya no da miedo ese playo cuando estaba carajillo me cagaba pero ya no hijueputa

ek1ePFp-nBI,Paurupuppuppaurupappap
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell Yeah!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry, Micheal looks a little underwhelming. He supposed to be this 6‚Äô5 250lbs beast of a monster who towers over people and bathroom stalls, it looks like he has to stand on his tip toes in order to strike fear in a women that‚Äôs peeing. Rob zombies Michael was a perfect representation of the psychotic killer filled with evil."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What in the timeline just happened?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Technically this means that  Michael Myers would be in his late 60's early 70's. He is not super human. Just a man. Some old weak dude. I could kick his ass. Not scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,So....guns are ok now. ....I see.
ek1ePFp-nBI,For to long we have waited
ek1ePFp-nBI,the night he comes home. #MyersIsBack
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nah. Nope. Hell No. This is old school horror and so I know it's gonna be the shit yourself kinda scary.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, I'm sure it will be good, it brings back Jamie Lee Curtis and the Original actor who played Micheal but the story in part is not so original at least the base plot. Go back and watch Halloween Resurrection 2002 which also starred Jamie Lee Curtis, who was then Married and had children (Teens) Micheal escaping confinement and coming after her....same as this new movie, now in Resurrection Curtis's Character Laurie ends up being killed at the end by Micheal, so I'm sure this movie may change that, so basically we are supposed to forget all of the sequels as if they never happened which tells us this new story so we go from 1978 straight 40 years later, the present. So Micheal must be pretty old by now and should be movie much slower Roght? He may need a walker....just kidding.  We don't factor in the two Rob Zombie remakes because they were just stand alones."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So he‚Äôs 5foot now huh?

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie Lee Curtis, woot!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I see a few comments where some of you guys are genuinely confused about the trailer. What we are looking at is an alternate timeline that stems straight from the 1978 Halloween film. This is the sequel to the original, meaning they are ignoring the other Halloween films, but reference a few moments from the other Halloween movies in the new film (*Michael killing the people in the diner is a reference to Halloween 4: Return of Michael Myers; the dropping teeth over the lady's bathroom stall is a reference to the bathroom scene with the woman and her little girl from Halloween: H20; the little boy bumping into Michael is reference from Halloween 2 (1980), and the patients almost getting run over in the street is a reference to Halloween (1978) when Michael escapes and let's out the other patients as a distraction). They have gone all the way back to the basics with this movie. Also, the reason why they say Michael has been locked up for 40 years is because it's literally been 40 years since the events of the original Halloween film. (1978-2018). 
I'm down for any questions anybody may have about the franchise üòä"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Im in 2015 you might be saying thats imposible...... well it is üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers face reveal
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry guys but John Carpenter had it right the first time. After the first movie, he had said that he realized there was no more story to his idea. So in order to do a sequel and give the idea/movie more story, he had them be brother and sister and gave us the family element. And he was right, it gave his whole idea more STORY. Otherwise, it's just Michael going after random people for no reason. Now look at what he is doing... He's doing a sequel with that SAME IDEA that has no more story. Just Michael going after strangers for no reason. He did the right thing making them brother and sister because it gave this awesome series a REAL on going story. 

Do you really want Halloween to be like Friday the 13th? Where Jason just kills random people for no god damn reason? There is literally NO STORY in those movies. It's LITERALLY the same thing every movie: People show up at camp. Jason kills them. Parts 1-4 painfully did that. Come on. 5-7 did the same thing as well. 8 finally tried to be different by changing location and scenery but it was still the same thing. Part 9 is actually the only one with a real story. As it wasn't just about Jason killing random people at the camp because he feels like it.

Would you guys really be okay with every Halloween movie being like that? Michael appears on Halloween and goes after random people for no reason? Then does the same thing to different people in the next one? Again for no reason? With no real connection from movie to movie. Them being brother and sister gave this series a real exciting story. Not to mention we had Loomis hunting him down in every movie, providing real continuity. And we saw recurring characters who really mattered to the story and Michael's motive. Not just random dumb camp counselors.

Also, this movie is going to be a complete waste. It's pretty clear based on the trailer that this is going to be a remake of the first movie. Just 40 years later and everyone is older. Come on, Michael starts out locked up at Smith's Grove, escapes, and goes back to Haddonfield on Halloween to kill teenagers. Really? Sound familiar? All he is doing is remaking the first movie with the same idea that has no more story to it. Okay, so he took away the family aspect? Why? So instead of Michael escaping to pursue his sister, he's escaping to pursue a stranger? Like why is that going to be any different? Instead of talking about how much Laurie escaped her brother, she'll be talking about how much she escaped a strange serial killer. Big wow. The brother/sister element made all of this a lot better.

And the second anyone ever says the words: ""Those movies never happened."" You're not making things better. You're making things worse. It's the worst thing any writer or creative person can do. Why would you build up this long franchise with such a major history and so many plots/characters advancing and moving forward, to just one day saying, ""Oh yea, by the way, those movies never happened."" Why does anyone think that is a good idea and why is even one person happy about that happening? And just because you get one not so well received movie like Resurrection, that doesn't mean you just give up, start all over and pretend the whole series never happened. LOL. Give me a break.

It's a huge mistake ignoring this entire series that we have spent YEARS and YEARS following. What a bitch slap to our faces. This easily could be a Halloween 9 if they would just acknowledge every damn movie and give a simple explanation as to how Laurie didn't really die in Resurrection. There was no need to approach this movie ignoring the other ones. None at all. And please, that line in the trailer about them being brother and sister being a ""rumor"" Are you fucking serious? That was no rumor. That was the real cannon story people. The only ""rumor"" should have been Thorn controlling Michael. See how simple it would be to tie all the movies together? LINES OF DIALOGUE. John Carpenter did not need to ignore this entire franchise to make this movie. So aggravating. And taking away the family element wasn't necessary either and was a huge mistake.

And um... They're going to be throwing a ""nod"" to the other movies while ignoring them at the same time? Are they fucking serious? Why not ""nod"" to them in a way that confirms they ALL HAPPENED! So they're going to ""nod"" to movies they claim never happened? LOL. So fucking dumb. Wow. This movie can be everything John Carpenter wants it to be, only it acknowledges every movie. Making this a TRUE sequel. I think these people need to learn how to reboot and continue at the same time. And not just rebooting to the point where you're wiping things clean.

Do you have any idea how more excited people would be if this trailer actually took place after all the other movies? By not doing that people's level of excitement has gone way down. But yes, I still see how excited people are and guess what? I'm excited too. But when I first heard Jamie Lee Curtis was coming back I was VERY happy about it until I learned they were ignoring the other movies and my level of excitement went way down.

And sadly guys... The only movie that's going to end up being ignored is this one. Cause we'll just end up getting a Halloween 9 one day anyway. And again, THIS movie now could be Halloween 9 if it simply acknowledged every movie.

For the record, I think this trailer looks awesome and I AM excited to see it and I WILL see it when it comes out. This really does look good. But it is too damn frustrating when I follow a long running series like this just to find out the whole damn thing is being ignored. There is never any need for that. Ever. They cannot ""Days of Future Past"" their way out of this. What's done is done.

P.S.

Rob Zombie is a sick fuck."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,is this another part of the dark universe or whatever crap they called it?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why aren‚Äôt Laurie and Michael siblings
ek1ePFp-nBI,"THEY BETTER NOT FUCK THIS MOVIE UP! HALLOWEEN IS AN ALL-TIME CLASSIC, DAMN IT!!!"

 out"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else kinda laughed when you realised she was just repeatedly hitting Michael in the face with that cupboard doorü§£ü§£ü§£
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks so cheesy
ek1ePFp-nBI,So everything after Halloween (1978) is not canon anymore? And wait Michael isn‚Äôt her brother now? And what about H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rating??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So they retconned EVERY sequel after the original? Wow. I thought Halloween 2 and H20 was solid. Everything else sucked. These 70s, 80s horror reboots/sequels haven't been that good in the new millennium with the exception of the most recent to straight to video Chucky films. However, this trailer looks awesome. Looking forward to it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Best Diss John Carpenter would make on Rob Zombie is if Laurie finds a rob zombie mask and just rip that shit and call it garbage
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now why the hell are there British people in this movie. They are too many in American movies. I swear.
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Rob zombie and his wife in this one??  YES!!!!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt stop watching this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween is like my FAVOURITE Horror movie franchise!!!! Along With Scream. I'm super excited for this and really hope they don't tuck it up like the Rob Zombie version.

Haters Come At Me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs hope they don‚Äôt ruin another classic with a bad sequel or reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maybe the main girl in the first friday the 13th movie had a daughter before she died  and she goes to crystal lake on the anniversary of the murders and her and her boyfriend have to face off against Jason and this would be a sequel to the first movie and ignoring all the other sequels and reboot and Jason lets say already has the Hockey mask since in this version he been there   for 40 years at the lake and lets say this takes place after Friday the 13th part 2 and also the blond girl who survived part 2 would not be in the movie but mentioned
ek1ePFp-nBI,god damn every single scare in this trailer is sooooo lame. this gonna be some epic failure.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope this movie doesn't suck jaime lee curtis's balls
ek1ePFp-nBI,don‚Äôt be mad at me or somethin but who‚Äôs dat old lady is she a new character or an old one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's Going to Be Epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I know this is supposed to be the last Halloween movie, but could you imagine how awesome it would be if they ended up making a cinematic universe for slasher villains? Freddy, Jason, Michael, (maybe even Chucky, pinhead, ghostface, and Leprechaun) all in the same universe... damn I'd pay a lot of money to see that"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I CANT WAIT !!!! JAMIE LEE IS BAD ASS. AS SOON AS I HEARD THEY MAKING THE MOVIE AND HAD JOHN CARPENTER ON BOARD FOR IT, SO WAS I."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks scary don't get me wrong, but it definety doesn't look as scary as the original Halloween, if anything this looks pretty funny!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I kinda squealed with happiness when I saw Jamie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG!!!!! YESS!! ANOTHER HALLOWEEN FOR ME TO WATCH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wwe raw
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""He was no one until he put on the mask"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I'm a little confused does this movie take place right after Halloween one or two given that the rest of the movies have been wiped from the continuity
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY A WORTHY HALLOWEEN MOVIE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoevers idea it was to transport Michael on a bus full of crazys needs to lose a testicle
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween tune gives me chills cos when it played you knew someone was about to get killed my michael. .. can't wait for this gonna be like old Halloween movies again ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I need an explanation..Laurie is alive!!!! But I know her return will be explained in this film....I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this....now as for him being in the closet I jumped and it‚Äôs only the freakin trailer!!! And if u haven‚Äôt watched every single Halloween, then u must do it to know why Laurie‚Äôs appearance is a very big deal."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:28 - image of a knife in a fridge
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween was never that scary to me, it's just mentally ill man, get a gun dammit and for some reason the police always shows up late, there's way more scarier old movies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this supposed to be a remake of Halloween 2 or is this the Halloween 3 we were robbed of years ago?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What about friday the 13th 


We had one but it was canceled"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully we get a 4k reissue of the classic on bluray soon
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cringe.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only good Halloween was the one from 1978, that's it. Everything else sucked."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"But, Jamie Lee died in the one????"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESS FINALLY
ek1ePFp-nBI,The movie that was made a few years after the original that everybody has watched every Halloween for almost 40 years that flows so perfectly with the original that you can watch both in a row and never know that you switched movies isn't canon. No No this cash grab movie made 40 years later by Danny Mcbride is the only real canon. At least until 2028 when H50 says this one never happened
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excited for this movie! The original is my favorite horror movie to date and this looks like it's going to be fantastic!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So Michael is not Laurie's brother this time?  He never was, was he? Judith was the sister he killed. Laurie and her friends just ""caught his attention"" for going up to his house.   Looks pretty good. I just wonder why they call it ""Halloween"" without a number or a subtitle if it is supposed to continue 40 years after the first."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They shouldn‚Äôt have shown the close scene
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Loocks Fuckings Awesome ;) PS Like if you hate Ramosüò°üò°üò°üò°
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why the hell would you give that nigga the mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,OOF
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like shit. It's set maybe 70 years after the original. Which it's like the sequels never happened. So your telling me we have a 70 something year old Michael and Laurie. Makes no sense at all. There is no way Michael was in lockup for 70 years without breaking out multiple times. I know this movie will be shit just like the Rob Zombie pieces of crap.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So wait, didn't Laurie die in Ressurection or is that movie being disregarded?"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow! <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,1978 > 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a remake? A sequel to the originals? A sequel to the Rob Zombie movies? Or a reboot? I am confused since there a bunch of Halloween movies out there. But this trailer looks cool tho.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love the original series, but im sorry this is just stupid, he would be in his 50s how can he still have the strength to do all of this, he was never a superhuman üôÑ sometimes they need to leave classics alone (unless they are reinventing the series)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good I wanna see
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im scared
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so good!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really hope some movie theaters will be showing the original movies leading up to a midnight viewing of the most recent one. If Hollywood is smart, they would do more things like this, why not make money off of movies you've already made to help the new one make even more money?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now we can officially erase the Rob Zombie remakes from existence. lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its back myke myers so good

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hope they've done something really good to pay tribute to the late great Donald Pleasence and his influence on the original. Hearing his words like in H2O or perhaps a relative or  Colleague Loomis passed his work onto obviously knowing Michael would be back one day. 





  After some Bad sequels and awful remakes never thought we'd get such a shake up in the timeline. Excited to see the real Michael back"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really can't wait. Hopefully it's a real horror movie where you get chills. Not like the new ones they calling horror movies. I loved the movie back in the day, but it will not be the same like younger. It's like the new Nightmare on elmstreet. It's not the same like the old one, if you understand me."

Awesome to see John Carpenter and Malek Akkad part of this again, and most of all Jamie Lee Curtis!!! .....but I seriously hope that's just make up, bcuz she looks 90 y.o. in this. She was smoking hot when she was younger, and still good when she she let her hair go gray. But in this trailer I'm not sure who looks more scary, Michael or Jamie. lol j/k. 
*Can't wait to see this!!*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it coming this Halloween if so hell ya I'm going to watch it like if you are to
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssssssssssss!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's with shoving the mask down his throat? It is unnecessary and why would it be allowed?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks interesting but we'll see if it lives up to the first few. The last few throw backs didn't live up to expectations.
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEEEEEEESSSSS

ek1ePFp-nBI,So the previous Halloween movies don't exist?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee looks like Madea ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh man.  The original Halloween is one of my all time favorite films.  Everything about it is perfection.  This seems to be way more in line with Carpenter's overall vision than the Rob Zombie shitpile we got over ten years ago.  I can't wait to see this and review it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Rob Zombie films are a disgrace to this franchise
ek1ePFp-nBI,But his little sister chopped his head off with an axe.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this looks really good but one question. How can it could be a crossover with the other parts of the halloween movies. I mean Halloween 8 was the last movie with Jamie Lee Curtis. As we know she died in that movie. So cancel the part 8. How does Michael survive Halloween H 20 if they eliminate part 8 for this movie?! Hmmm....

Whats this like the 100th movie they made"
ek1ePFp-nBI,ooh i‚Äôm so ready for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I search for this movie in imdb.com and I found that jamie lee does the same character of laura strode but how can be this possible if she dies in halloween resurrection??? I think they should show a different trailer without her if they will show how she survive in halloween resurrection it looks so good this movie but let's see how she comes back from the death perhaps she have his same power come back from the death hahahahaha

ek1ePFp-nBI,Part 1+2 (the same) with H2O....now 2018 makes the most sense. I bet that is how it is going down.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, so this is supposed to take place after Halloween (1978) right? Just making sure it doesn't follow 2,4,5,6 or 2,7,8 story arcs. We'll just forget that Rob Zombies versions ever happened lol"

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36üòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,"There are a couple references to previous films here.
2:07 Two kids are wearing masks that look like silver shamrock masks from Halloween 3
Martin finding a dead mechanic a reference to halloween 4
And Laurie‚Äôs daughter and granddaughter could be a reference to the 4-6 trilogy with Laurie having Jamie which she gives birth to a baby herself. I forgot the baby‚Äôs name."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,this made IT looks like shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'd ask how this is going to disregard canon, but on the upside it's going to ignore the Rob Zombie Halloween movies.... which I think we can all live with that..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY HALLOWEEN 9 after 40 years since the 1978 Halloween they are finally making a new one im pretty sure they also are gonna ignore the events that happened in Halloween 8/resurrection and stick with the Halloween 1 to 7 events.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So are they ignoring Halloween 2 as well??? I thought they were including it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes yes yes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who's get's the feel of movie 'The Strangers'
ek1ePFp-nBI,We've all been waiting üòè
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched all of the hollween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Scott is that u?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks great, but so many questions... like why did that man with the woman and dog give Michael the mask?! Also why does Lorie still think she can kill him as if he hasn‚Äôt been though the same shit and survives each time?!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,True horror. I rewatched x10.

ek1ePFp-nBI,The jumps are at the end nearly gave me a heart attack
ek1ePFp-nBI,02:37 gave me the fucking chills man
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm excited! It's practically H40. Halloween 40 years later. So, they kept the first movie but removed the second and other such sequels. An interesting move. Let's find out what happens. XD"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is a direct sequel to the 1978 film.
ek1ePFp-nBI,They even brought the theme song back!üòÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween ? It‚Äôs June guys , chill out"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Classics have came back to show this generation how horror movies should be!
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:48 Is that the Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didnt he die in Halloween 2 ?  He was burnt with dr san lumus ( sorry if spellt wrong)
ek1ePFp-nBI,And why this hoe lying about her uncle
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS LOOKS SO GOOD YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,That ain‚Äôt no damn Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,"HOLY SHIT I'M EXCITED! I'm glad Laurie is still kicking ass. I hope they have the original soundtrack throughout the whole movie. Makes me want to watch the first one again.

It's one of my greatest dreams to work on a Halloween. :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm hyped!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I luv this and all the halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,not another one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus Christ... Look Mom, Its Halloween (for the umpteenth time) with Aliens (2) storyline.  So does Jamie Lee Curtis say ""Get away from her you bitch!"" as well?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"alfred hitchcock quoted on how to build tension: we see two people sitting and talking, we see a bomb under the table they're sitting next to, but the characters are too busy talking, even though we know the outcome it would still give us an impact.

Halloween took that idea and walked with it.... along with a knife."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope they give Dr Loomis a proper send off in this movie. Even though the actor passed away many years ago, he was the best part of all the sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Communist Hollywood lacks originality and creativity...liberalism truly is a disease
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes so excited for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,New rainbow six game mode
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who wants to spark a blunt with me
ek1ePFp-nBI,The fact that everybody does the trailers the exact same way makes movies look generic. This doesn't do the movie any favors.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wonder why I have a feeling this is going to be poor? Hm! The Shape is, what, 70 years old! Tyler Mane pulled, Myer's off perfectly in my opinion."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too cheese
ek1ePFp-nBI,So where does this sit in the franchise!?
ek1ePFp-nBI,4.5 million views in almost 12 hours... pretty impressive! Cannot wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like a mere excuse to perpetuate the propaganda of a ""strong female character"". 

Yay. 

Cuz that's never been done before. 

If women truly were ""strong and independent"" we wouldn't need a perpetual barrage of propaganda being shoved down our throats. It would be self evident. It seems the people who force this incessant stream of feminist propaganda down our throats...don't even believe it themselves. 

How sad."
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEA!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why won't they give this series a rest! #smh Hollywood has to do better
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok now Iv`e seen the hole fucking movie thanks bye!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who‚Äôs hyped for this?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone down to take me to see it in October üòù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Favorite horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If those jumpscare cues are in the final film, this movie's fucked."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music makes this trailer so much better.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good.  I have been a fan since I was a kid back in the early 80‚Äôs.  The last several they have made have all been a disgrace.  Hopefully this will redeem the series.  I can‚Äôt wait.  And to release it around Halloween is even better!!  And nick castle being the shape is the best move they could have made.  He was the best out of all of them.  Hopefully carpenter does the music because that makes a huge difference.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,I crapped my britches
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aaaaah i remember him is this not the gay guy who likes latex masks ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait - didn‚Äôt he already kill Laurie Strode? Which one was it? He stabbed her in the gut - how is she still alive?! üòë
ek1ePFp-nBI,I will say it definitely looks like the most well-lit Halloween movie ever...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like the bgm.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do they show a short 5 sec clip before trailers now? It ruins the impact of the trailer dang it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,again? smh. But guess what? I'M HERE FOR IT!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good . Holy shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lmfaoo last Scene when the little boy is like can you close the closet and she was trying but Myers was like BITCH PLZ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Rotten Tomatoes is gonna give this a 45%, lol bitch ass credits don't know what a good horror movie is."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad a** grandma lol

ek1ePFp-nBI,Early?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn this actually looks on point!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this movie ‚Äòposed to be the 3rd one from the Rob Zombie remake series? 
Is this movie on canon with Halloween H20 from 1998? Anyone know?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN DIS BITCHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn this looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait üôåüèæ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hi there! Please check out my new YouTube channel Please check out my new YouTube channel,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC487AVZzwbT4bio-zkAaW6gthank you"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie died. Michael killed her in resurrection. So why make another Halloween movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,3k dislikes? Some people are too salty. This trailer looks rad
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer gives me the chills. Waited so long for this movie to finally get in the works and it finally comes out this year.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hate the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For all who do not know, This Halloween takes place 40+ years after *HALLOWEEN* 1978. (The original) only. 

*parts 2,4,5,6,7 is no longer part of the cannon; no continuity. 

This will make a whole 'nother timeline.

*I'm so Excited*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really don't like those first 5 seconds of a dozen small clips mushed together. Why is it even a trend now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wait so is this a sequel to Halloween 1978 and H20?  or just Halloween 1978?
i see it looks to be ignoring parts 2,4,5,6,8 (and part 3 had nothing to do with Michael Myers) 
but in this trailer it says that Lorie is not Michael's sister.. but in H20 Michael is Lorie's sister and Lorie has a son and in this movie they say Lorie is someones grandmother .. which would go along with her having a son.. 

so what is the official cannon ? is it '78, 2, H2O, 2018? 
or is it just '78, 2018? 
or is it '78, H20, 2018?

seriously i really hate it when companies fuck up a time line this bad with movie monsters...
it happens all the time too .. 
NOES did it 
Hellraiser did it
even the old monster movies did it like the Frankenstein and Dracula and Wolfman series ... but that is excusable since back then they didnt have VCRs DVDs or BluRays to rewatch and coherently connect the movies 
even Friday the 13th did it with Mrs. Voorhees's grave putting the wrong year on the tombstone  (it should say 1980 but it says 1979 other than that the Friday the 13th time line is pretty solid Jason has the damage from the previous movies in the right places his change of clothes is explained the only other thing that is messed up is him getting a new hockey mask with the same ax mark ... you'd think when he got a new mask he would either choose a different mask or if he sticks with the hockey mask that it wouldnt have the ax mark in the left side of his head..but as far as the story time line it all is in the right spots...)

anyway .. just trying to figure out where this Halloween movie fits in to the others .. 
i would like to think it goes '78, H2O, 2018 ... 
but if that doesnt fit then someone needs to fix it so that it makes sense in some sort of way .. if it can even be fixed that is .."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAY!!!! I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS!!!! Even the trailer gives me chills....
ek1ePFp-nBI,COME ON 100k Likes PLZZZZüò≠üòç

ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF
ek1ePFp-nBI,All these horror movies are always similar.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let‚Äôs face it, this movie is going to stink. I guarantee all of you. It‚Äôs just another stupid remake to a classic slasher film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol I thought this would be a kid movie but nope you have to scare me to death
ek1ePFp-nBI,But John Wick is the boogeyman! The Baba Yaga

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie is going to be big!! I‚Äôm so excited for this!! They are using the original music and the mask looks like the original just weathered. The whole concept, the story looks incredible. If I could lactate out of excitement, I would!!!  I‚Äôm literally going to cum!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,All they gotta do is attach some bombs to this strong bitch ass Michael and blow that bitch up but no they wanna lock him up üôÑ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Well.. I'm still here waiting for Jason V Micheal. If Jason can kill Freddy.. He can kill anyone. I love how they still give Jason and Michael A kind heart. Not every villain is bad. We for real need a Jason Voorhees Movie Or Series.

They were scared to spend any money on old franchises because they assumed the titles were old and dead. But its Almost like if you make a good film people will enjoy it, FUNNY THAT! HUH?"

ek1ePFp-nBI,So Laurie has been waiting 40 years to kill someone who killed 5 people and terrorized her one night? I get what they're wanting to do by tossing aside the sequels but Michael's kill count now is very low and Laurie's motivation seems too far fetched based on just the first film. I don't understand why this is so appealing to the fans who felt fucked over by Rob's interpretation. You can now count his kills on your hand which would make the likes of Vorhees and Leatherface roll on the ground with laughter.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks like terribly acted, horribly written, stupidly shot and lit money grab that‚Äôs just going to added to the list of failed horror movie franchise reboots.  Honestly, the script is so painfully obvious, it‚Äôs like ‚Äòshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äô was never taught to the screenwriter.  The actors all act like their high and can hardly remember their lines, and the cinematography makes so sense, why is Micheal being filmed in broad daylight?  And why does he throw the teeth?  He‚Äôs not a clever, psychological monster, he‚Äôs just a monster.  The original Halloween was a slasher, and that genre is dead because, one, people got tired of brainless monsters killing helpless teens, and two, because directors tried to make every killer a Chucky or Freddy Kruger who does all these psychological tricks.  This movie looks like a disaster and I‚Äôm just looking forward to all those people going ‚Äòomg this looks great‚Äô to shut up when it gets bombed in the first reviews."

Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a big dream >_<
I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM* I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 31k comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!). 

*FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen.

I was so excited because I LOVED Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. (Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!). 

As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos WHENEVER I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. (SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!) 

So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. TakeTheJurny, because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice. No one has to sub I just wanted everyone to have a chance to see my Youtube before it hits 1million, and that will happen one day :) thanks for reading, and as always I will see you, when I heed the call, to the next Journey, Adios guys! <3 and thanks so much for reading!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,jamie lee curtis the real scream queen!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks cool but when are they gonna stop him like for real for real it‚Äôs annoying how he always escapes
ek1ePFp-nBI,This gave me goosebumps... can‚Äôt wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its only June
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My dream that i get 1000 subs
pls help me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, So this is Halloween H20, but Halloween H40. We are doing the same thing here that they did then: completely ignoring the events of all the previous movies. Okay, fine, but why, OH WHY, would that dipshit go to Mike (and the way he is restrained outside in the sun without cover is inhumane, but - whatever) and poke the hornets nest. This looks like a slightly worse film than H2 (2009). Also, say what you will, but I enjoyed rob zombies take on Halloween. It was the sequel that made no sense."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Me and my brother have been practising the halloween theme on piano the past halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM SO WATCHING THIS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks ridiculous and like something you try to avoid stepping on in your neighbors yard.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm not a big Halloween guy but this is cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why couldn't they think of a title?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait a remake in 2018 that actually looks good? Gotta say I'm excited for a movie for once.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Micheal as a troll. ""Girl you ain't closing this closet!"" 2:24"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This might be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,An actual horror movie that I'm interested in.. yaay.
ek1ePFp-nBI,BLICKY GOT THE STIFFY UHHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,"soooo many callbacks to the original!!
sooo excited!! :D"
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:39 this guy looks like the winner of Britains got talent
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone explain to me how this doesn't come out on Halloween?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Those tubuler bells!
ek1ePFp-nBI,espero que seja o melhor de todos
ek1ePFp-nBI,"we wrote a song, sorry to be a nuisance we would appreciate it if anyone (anyone at all) would listen!!:)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I used to *FEAR* Michael Myers.
I got over it and now this movie has made it come back üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,pause at 1:49
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yay it's made by blumhouse can't wait to get pointless scares come out of nowhere.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ooooo looks thrilling
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks really good. Love Michael's look in the film and the scene with the teeth. I enjoyed Halloween II but I'm glad they're going back to the original mythology. But why's it just called Halloween? Couldn't they be more creative and call it Halloween Returns atleast? Also I love Michael and Laurie's stories in the film. Laurie is T2 Sarah Connor and Michael is Dark Knight Returns Batman.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm Going. üòå
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie is a follow-up four decades after the original film
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant Waitüëèüëèüëèüí™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Michael still got it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers lurking in the background was what scared people. He was almost mystical. I hope they keep the same premise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Qu√© hermosa la pel√≠cula
ek1ePFp-nBI,To be honest the more movies they continue with the classic movies ruins the story.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The closet monster is real!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, this looks WAY better than I expected"
ek1ePFp-nBI,All of the likes in the video will make John Carpenter and Jason Blum happy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looking great!
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57 who‚Äôs that actor I know him from somewhere?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, she's been practicing her headshots."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bathroom stall scene.. nod to the one in Rob Zombie remake?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit. The bathroom scene took me back to my childhood. I was holding my breath with my hand over my mouth for her.  ü§£
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so readyü§§
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm sorry, but he is her brother."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks sick can‚Äôt wait üòè

ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear if this is a cheap moneygrab im gonna slap someone
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just by looking at the trailer I can already tell who is going to die.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why doesn‚Äôt anyone like the rob zombie versions?üò≠ I actually liked both of his movies over the others, please explain"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Won‚Äôt they have cell phones to just call the cops ? Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,if virgina gardner dies i will SUE danny mcbride
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks pretty damn good!

*Any fanatic wants to give me how the continuity goes?* I've only seen the first 2 and the Rob Zombie reboot, haven't seen the others but I know Jamie Lee Curtis is in some but I've heard that some of those got scrapped from the ""canon"". Either way, I'm hyped about this one and will watch it :D"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The TRUE sequel to Halloween: Part 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks sick!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish they let the events in the hospital in Halloween 2 exist as well
ek1ePFp-nBI,"for halloween,  ive decided to make sex illegal"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait to shit my pants
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequel to the first Halloween because it has stuff from the first one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dont kill me for this but didn't Jamie Lee Curtis die on one of these, they not sticking with the timeline? Dont judge me it looks great, i just thought she was dead..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet scene at the end was funny üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have bin waiting for this my whole lifeüôèüèΩ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Everything about this trailer is perfect
ek1ePFp-nBI,by far the actor that plays Michael is spot to the original from way back ..now I wanna see it...and I thought jaime Lee curtis died in resurrection??? but I'm happy she is back !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not bro and sis?? Ruining the lore of halloween

ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny Mc bride direct this ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhhh crap. I am a huge fan of slasher films. And Micheal is my man. Can't wait!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They had the tryouts and what not for the movie in Virginia I believe, thought about it, they needed nerdy teens and what not. But in the end decided against in, too far, wouldn't get paid but a little, yeah would have been fun but just a bit too much struggle."

2.  When u see him for a second and turn away and then turn back he is gone. Then the person runs into Meyers shortly thereafter and he is on the other side of the house, building or street lol. Wtf"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt she have a son in Halloween h20??? Now it‚Äôs a daughter???
ek1ePFp-nBI,I gotta see that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks so good !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does this guy ever die shoot him in the head.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck rob zombie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love it üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got jumpscared from a fucking trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this storyline is going to act like halloween 2,4,5,6 never existed"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How much sluts and sex scenes and dumb skinny brauds and other lame people will be in this movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks... not good
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMGGGGGGG!!!! I cant wait to see it...This is one of my favorite thriller movie since I was a child!!! I love it from the bottom of my heart. Im so happy he is back!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG FINALLY HE RETURNS! LIKE IF YOUR GONNA SEE THIS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie is fine, but the classic of this movie is so much more better than this movie is

This movie is not that scary to me blah because I‚Äôve seen better"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OK, THEY NEED TO KNOCK THIS SHIT OF OF TRYING TO RESURRECT THESE OLD FUCKING MOVIES !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't remember the last time I was this amped for a horror movie. Michael has come home!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What happened to 2 and H20?... Like.... what?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nose ustedes pero por un momento pense que el soundtrack era say amen (saturday nigth) de Panic! At the disco
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Did anyone else get a boner when the teeth dropped to the floor?


EDIT: I still have one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,really?? this is why I hate Hollywood now. Michael killed her at the psych ward....now she has powers like him?? she survived that stabbing & fall?? I am OVER this franchise. y'all have fun.
ek1ePFp-nBI,My friend in Charleston was Ubering and got Jamie Lee Curtis as her rider during the filming. Sooooooo excited for this!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,"if you enjoy a 13 year old screaming in your ear... that's the movie for you... Kids don't like horror movies... they only like screaming and jump scares... (which is..?? fun?? for them) ... it's the same reason why kids like roller coasters...(because of the screaming...) but these things have nothing to do with an actual horror movie...
If you appreciate the acting of jamie lee curtis maybe you can understand what the movie is all about..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,SpOoktacular!!! üéÉ üéÉ üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,micheal myers!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did anyone's else notice when Michael was in the house someone else was there also
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Meyers always walks because  he still has rash for not wearing his tighty whities for years üí¶üåëüòÇ



No wonder whyüòÇüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The team working on this has done a good job. The trailer has me interested and I will definitely be going to the theater to see this. I also like the multiple sequel universe. It opens the doorway for other franchises
ek1ePFp-nBI,Using that blue pumpüòÖ 1:18 loooove thatüî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead By Daylight‚Äôs NO.1 killer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, this actually looks good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holly shit!
ek1ePFp-nBI,TATE
ek1ePFp-nBI,John carpenter's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,This freaking music is scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like Michael is smaller than he should be
ek1ePFp-nBI,This didn't do it for me this trailer didn't grab me to and didn't make me want to go see it in theater. Everyone is so hyped for this and will disappointed at the end of the movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What she do you need to be to watch the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm really digging the prison angle. Smart move, John Carpenter. Makes it less gimmicky and more realistic. Also, Jamie Lee looks totally badass. I predict that the investigative reporter is revealed to be a Michael Myers wannabe and fan. Jamie Lee kills the real Michael Myers halfway through the movie, then the reporter shows up for the second half only to be revealed at the end. It makes sense that they would do that to add a sense of the supernatural."
ek1ePFp-nBI,That old hag is fucking pissing me off
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequal or reboot? I really can't tell
ek1ePFp-nBI,Try it out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm always sleeping with my closet door open
ek1ePFp-nBI,Only fanatic fan feel how happy i am now. Watch all halloween movie and now finally. Some kid that dont watch all the movie dont act like you know this legend.

ek1ePFp-nBI,He walk slow n what special power does he has??? 1 shot to the head will get the job done.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Ehh I'll save my money and just re watch the original masterpiece by John Carpenter. Not seeing the same atmosphere here. Maybe it's not replicable. They already tried reboots by Rob Zombie..this is getting tiresome.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Jeeze fuk yah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oooohhh shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie die in the original movies ? So what was that a bad dream and now she awake?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How is Michael Myers even still alive, let alone in prison (implying someone actually caught him and lived)? You'd think a combination of old age and all the injuries he sustained over the years would cripple him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So I'm guessing this is some sort of sequel? I mean, it takes place 6 years after the first movie...But it seems also like an alternative to what happened, scratching off the original sequels and making this one. It said that he was arrested after Loomis shot him, which doesn't happen. They didn't find a body and it leads into Halloween 2. 

So my best guess is that this is a reboot/sequel hyrbrid, trying to take off the original sequels and have this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's good but in the same time it's like Crap. Blumhouse production what happen to you
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are Jason and Freddy gonna be in this one ....nuff said LAME

ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a big Halloween fan I can't wait to see this!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only western culture holiday not turned into a horror film is Passover. I guess it's because no one would go see it.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuk reboots
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hola
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ahhhhh yes.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait when does this movie take place? I'm a bit confused lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,After 10 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm confused , I thought this was a reboot not a sequel"
ek1ePFp-nBI,DUDE..  JUST FUCKING DUUUUDE

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow I gotta see it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Y do people hype up horror movies anymore they all suck now

ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Michael killed Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie in the previous Halloween movie or did she somehow survive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Baba Yaga!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is it me, or does Michael Myers look genuinely sad or upset, in the thumbnail?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 did i hear pingu? Wtf

ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Leave the guy alone already
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this doesn't end up like that Texas Chainsaw movie in 2013.....Both are already similar af. Both films decide to forget the sequels and just follow up the first film in the franchise decades later.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just Halloween ??? Jeez this is getting confusing ..why name it like the first movie ???? Wasn‚Äôt a re make years ago named the same ?  Like wtf

Maybe she's not the oy one who can't die hahahüòÇüòÇ but I would like a real explanation and why they made this. It's too late for this sequel.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hell yeah!for picking up years later basically erase those other ass attempts at a true sequel,but i liked Rob Zombies origin story of Michael cant wait for this!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lit!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"HE HAD THE DARKEST EYES...THE DEVILS EYES...

U DONT KNOW WHAT DEATH IS.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"so even Halloween 2 is struck from the canon? thats a shame, i thought it fit fine iwth halloween 1 and having the much higher bodycount in a night of total chaos caused by Myers helps go towards what made him some legendarily frightening. Nevertheless i hope this one is decent"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pretty sure Curtis character died.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woooooooooowwww epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love it love it love it can't fucking wait man
ek1ePFp-nBI,who else though of COD zombies when the music came in hahah

Given the many times this movie has gone into hiatus, I've been worried about it's future. Not to mention the amount of changes to the script and staff. That said, this trailer does show a lot of promise, and it looks like we'll be getting the traditional Halloween film back. I'm not one for going to the Cinema, but I might just have to go to see this one. I'd like to give a shout out to Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter for returning to the franchise, and bringing it back to its roots."

Lets just hope in this one he doesn't run and he doesn't look like a hobo. Ps is this a remake to the second remake

ek1ePFp-nBI,"michael meyers always walks because he doesn't want to risk hurting himself by running with a knife. 




*my whole life has been a lie*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love the trailer except the lack of recoil when Laurie is firing the rifle. I've fired a very similar rifle and there is quite a lot. Always bugs me in movies when they don't have it it makes it so obvious that they're using blanks. Other than that.... Awesome can't wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"All of those dislikes are the people who liked Halloween Resurrection. 
(Edit: Let me rephrase myself. The people who like Halloween 2 Rob Zombie edition. The people who don't agree with removing the second movie, and the people who wanted it to be a direct sequel of Resurrection are disliking this video, also I've seen people who have liked resurection, and those people are a bunch of dumbasses.)

Let's not forget COUGH COUGH Halloween 3 people just to put that in there."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a new horror classic im so hyped it looks so nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can already tell this film will have the worst ending where the old woman kills mike and he‚Äôs alive right at the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is the true Son of our Creator Father God. Jesus loves you so much dear ones and have a perfect plan for your life.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie strode is back in the house!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The confinement for 40 years, is complete and ignorant bullshit!!!! Every time he escaped over the years, he killed even more fucking people (Sliced)!!! Obviously I would know this, I saw all the sequels.üßêüßêüßê"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If he kills the kid at the end of the trailer, I‚Äôm going to be pissed. But seriously though, Michael looks like a complete badass this time around and he doesn‚Äôt feel overused or out of character like in previous installments. I think this idea to make this the sequel was perfect and I‚Äôm very excited to watch this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seems very fitting for the #MeToo movement. Crazy bitter as fck old woman seeking devious revenge for something a man did 40 years ago.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lmao they actually made a film after that killer from dead by daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay so he'd be pretty old in this one. I believe he was originally at least 10 years older than Lori.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hey another one of these dumb movies. Wonder what‚Äôs going to happen.
ek1ePFp-nBI,At least its not directed by Rob Zombie this time
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this guy... Is the Boogie man?




John ?Wick"
ek1ePFp-nBI,because the movies of the old ones of fear turn them into police investigations it takes away the effect of terror is the same with gijsaw 8
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dang I ain‚Äôt know that was Jamie lee Curtis üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oof an other remak thats gonna fail
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This number one on trending? Not mad, just surprised."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It is scary

ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:21 - Isn't that the dude who was on ""Who wants to be a millionare?"" xD"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween is the ultimate choose your own story. After the 1st own you can watch part 2, 4, 5, and 6, or just parts 2 and 4, or just part 2, or H2O and Resurrection, or just H2O, and now just this new one.

Part 3 really has no connection to the rest so it doesn't matter to the order, and the Rob Zombie ones shouldn't be watched by ANYONE."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie Strode is Grandma Death....Every living creature on this earth dies alone.

ek1ePFp-nBI,How is this not no.1 on trending
ek1ePFp-nBI,same movies that was michael myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't know what is worse. Michael in the moldy mask or what has happened to Jamie Lee Curtis. So to get this straight. Michael is now 61 and Laurie is pushing 60. So in '78 Michael is 20/21 and Laurie in high school. He then is stabbed in the jugular vein with a sewing needle, poked in the eye with a coat hanger, stabbed with a steak knife, then shot, at point blank range 6 times. I am 51 and feel every bit of it. This is what cinema has become. 2 geriatrics fighting it out on the big screen. They should just swap meds and call it a day!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,New Title: Freddy Gets His American Freedom
ek1ePFp-nBI,What movies are Canon to this one? Is the first two Halloween movies part of this as well h20 and rezerection?

ek1ePFp-nBI,It's like the scream movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shesssss back....awesome..no one else can beat Michael....welcome back...Sister...Jamie Lee the original equalizer...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't Busta Rhymes' character stop him? Didn't Curtis' character die? I still want to see it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The grandma looks badass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why bring him his mask üòÇüòÇüòÇ You got a Death wish?
ek1ePFp-nBI,My brother and sister made me watch the original when I was little around Halloween time. By far the scariest movie I remember watching
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool Mickey Rourke mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I feel like I've basically watched the entire thing through this trailer, but I still can't wait to watch it on release"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What‚Äôre you talking about this is mike Myers.

ek1ePFp-nBI,it will be release on halloween of course.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's funny. At the end you just know he's in the closet but the reveal still catches me off guard.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks very stupid.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice the horror movie characters actually have guns now
ek1ePFp-nBI,That was silly as hell. Screw this movie. Why not just make a sequel (yeah I saw ALL the ripoffs of the other films they stole)?  Easily could have made this a final film... Is this supposed to set up Jamie getting killed and Michael will now stalk THIS new niece in more sequels...? Easily could have been a final chapter for US that starts a new one for the new generation (who NEVER make the horror remakes hits)... He could have been 'captured' after 8 and then been in the asylum for the last 10 years and Laurie survived that fall (cuz we didn't see her die)...but NO.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead By Daylight!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚ÄîThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚ÄîThat whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. ‚ÄîSuch has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount an payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred. to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. ‚ÄîAnd for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

ek1ePFp-nBI,In what world does Jamie Lee Curtis think a 45-70 lever action rifle is a practical gun for home defense? Is this set in California? Because if it isn't she should have an AR15 with a high capacity mag if she's been waiting for Michael's return.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I see many issues with this already. Blumehouse can't escape the clich√©s here. Sadly this really doesn't look like John Carpenter's had a hand in it at all to me. More typical predictable modern horror scenes here. Sad.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can‚Äôt take him seriously with that mask, I could caption that so much."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Underwhelming
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm gonna go to the fan event for this if they do it ! It will be the best night ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes yes yes yes I was waited this all year and last year
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Watched this yesterday wasn't trending. People wished for it. And now it's number 1 xD. Anywho. My thought process is that if you listen closely you hear her say that she's been praying for him to break out so she could kill him. So, maybe all the sequels that are now presumed as a fake movie are actually just dreams of hers since she did say she prayed daily for this to happen. Idk just my assumption about this whole deal. Either way I can not wait for this!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The teeth tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT MICHAELS BACK EVERYBODY RUUUN...TO THE CINEMA.......

ek1ePFp-nBI,Now I‚Äôm excited for Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this movie is 40 years after the first movie and it's ignoring all the sequels after it and the crappy remakes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No matters how fast can you run, Michael Myers can walk faster."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't believe that I actually get to watch a 
Halloween movie at the cinema"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who are listening to these prayers? because they need to be fired
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:56, doesn't that sound awful lot like Jurassic Park?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal Myers is a coming
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yasss
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow! They're really milking this one, of course I'm going to watch it though lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween coming in Halloween can‚Äôt wait ! Why guy visit him in prison and brings him the mask ? That reminds Michael of his past ? Either way gonna be so good !
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many more times are they going to beat this dead horse?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Order you seats now ladies and gentleman, this is gonna be the movie of the century for all the halloween crazies!! Can't wait, looks like it's gonna be awesome!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Niceeeeeeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers... always be the iconic horror character in film history.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So whats like the full story Michel....
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope fredy vs jason reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not just your another ""scary"" movieüòàüòàüòà"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Check out Mike Shinoda¬¥s of Linkin Park new song Ghosts - https://youtu.be/ObDgFUTP0PA
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie, i am French and i fuckng like Michael myers, big fan, back to the 1978 üéÉüî™‚è≥"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watch Liv & Nance
ek1ePFp-nBI,lmfao!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""No. It was not her brother. That's something people made up.""

Damn, taking shots at the Halloween sequels. Rightfully so, they were shit üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs back
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am always the first to see movies so I'm the first this time
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just don‚Äôt see the point in this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can see it already the plot twist will be lori is Michael Myers an she has gone crazy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Danny Mcbride co-wrote the screenplay üòÇ how weird is that, I hope he did a good job"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*N O O T N O O T*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People: It's school day !

YouTube: *it's Halloween !*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,BITCH GOT ATTACKED ON THE TOILET
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG cannot wait loved these films from childhood
ek1ePFp-nBI,my dad has a tattoo of Micheal on his back üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Out of body out of mind experiences..if you are in need of a competent HACKER who can hack into any database, any mobile phone, any social media account, contact me via: Parachutelift(at)gmail(dot)com. Only for serious minded people."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I think it's cool that they erased Halloween 2-35, but I dont think it's cool that it's pretty much the exact same plot as the original. Almost beat by beat it seems. If you were to play the 1st one next to this you'd get almost the exact same movie. Still intrigued though."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Typical ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the entire movie crap‚Äù, if you believe after 10 seconds that you might see the entire movie in the trailer than STOP.  Idiots."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I LOVE MICHAEL HE IS SO FUCKING COOL !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many remakes are they going to do?
ek1ePFp-nBI,SOMEBODY GET BUSTA RYMES
ek1ePFp-nBI,So good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Much better if The Shape Stalks theme is put over this. More thrilling and more chills.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie died in a movie what the hell
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome.  Love the direction they went. Last scene is dope.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm buzzing for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is he still alive ? Why the hell he haven't got the death sentence ? Why the hell they are moving him with a solid chance of him fleeing and killing ? Why is wrong with the authority?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've never seen any of the Halloween movies, but for some reason I hate that Laurie and Michael aren't related. It is nice that they're remaking the timeline though..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:30 ah, I really wish they hadn't shown that jumpscare, because it's actually a good one. Now when that scene comes in the movie, I'll automatically know what to expect (unless they don't use it in the movie, I know not every clip is used)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They even made her voice sound old.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"All the sequels are written off as ""urban legends"" or fictional movies that were based on Laurie's one night of terror (kinda like the ""Stab"" movies in ""Scream 2 & 3"". However, it was the sequels that established Mikey as an unstoppable force of nature hellbent on killing Laurie. So her 40-year paranoia in this one seems unfounded."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have nightmares ever since I first halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad ass!! I'm glad they still used the Halloween  theme song!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My elementray school gym teacher's full name is Micheal Meyers.

That music get's me laughing to LMFAO."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else have an issue with getting pizza rolls cooked right? Some are way to hot others still frozen in the middle
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please. We don't need another shitty movie from this reject. Sorry Michael, Jason took the throne."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't Jamie Lee Curtis get smoked in resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie's gonna Ripley the shit out of Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:50 really stood out for me with Michael Myers putting the mask on. Such a killer moment of the trailer!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Absolutely buzzing for this!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm on vacation in Myrtle Beach and I see this trailer and super hype than I go to the comments and see that someone said this movie was made in SouthCarolina like oh hell naw!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Œ∏Œ¨'ŒΩŒ±Œπ œáŒøŒΩœÑœÅŒÆ ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ±, Œ±ŒªŒªŒ¨ Œ±œÜŒøœÅŒºŒÆ ŒΩŒ± ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œ¥ŒøœçŒºŒµ œÑŒ± œÄŒ±ŒªŒπŒ¨"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just why? The franchise had reboot before. Got ridiculed. That not enough?
ek1ePFp-nBI,*bonus meme*
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will be way better than the rob zombie movie versions and the originals after the 1st 2..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait to see
ek1ePFp-nBI,Originality is dead in Hollywood.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael  scary even tho riddled with arthritis & a weak bladder...psycho-pensioner üòÇüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks actually good tbh. I wanted it to die after seeing the title, but looks pretty good now. The mask makes him look less evil"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The piano parts sound like Jurassic parks theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,So now you can purchase an older looking William Shatner mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"H20-Those other sequels didn't happen
Rob Zombie-Those other sequels didn't happen
Halloween 2018-Those other sequels didn't happen

What an absolute mess. The Halloween timeline is more confusing and ridiculous than the Zelda timeline."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Think Texas chainchaw revenge
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watch it have some shitty cliffhanger ending to set up a sequel cause you know $üí∞üíµüí∏üí≤
ek1ePFp-nBI,SORRY RIP MOSHAFA AKKAD

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes the original one is BACK!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why are they disregarding the original halloween 2? Or at least thays what the trailer gives off. It would just make more sense to include h2 in this story line. Jamie Lee Curtis was in it and to me it wouldn't make sense to not include the storyline of h2 since it literally picked up right after Dr. Loomis shot him.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Scream : mask changed psychopath
ek1ePFp-nBI,i don't want to see this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,RIP MOSTAFA   AKARD
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just want to say thank you !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don‚Äôt get why this trailer is in J U N E, when it‚Äôs actually premiering in October."
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCKING YES MICHAEL THE HUN SKELPER
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:56 instant goose bumps, this music its just like so memorys. Im so ready for this movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm curious how he looks like. ..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I know Buckethead is happy! Me too, Buckethead, me too!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,When will this motherfucker die already? He‚Äôs probably getting too old for this shit anyway. I can‚Äôt wait for Jamie Lee Curtis to end his psycho-ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,... H20 was a continuation from Halloween 2.... Resurrection was the sequel to H20 where she had gone crazy and died falling off the hospital roof....  Now where does this fit in?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not going to be as good as the rob zombie directed movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,this might actually be good. I like the Laura vs Michael. Without that it would just be stupid ppl running from a walking killer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs just the fact that this movie said that Halloween‚Äôs 2-5 never happened.
ek1ePFp-nBI,And it's John Carpentor too. Cannot wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Rob Zombie üò≠üò≠üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'll admit, Zombie's first remake wasn't the greatest, but the 2nd one is a masterpiece. The way he follows the white horse, really illustrates his insanity. And how brutal he was. I really loved Zombie's MM, especially in 2. But this, although I'm hoping it's great and will see it, for one, is very unnecessary. So it better be extra good, or the title remains in RZ's hands, imo."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"some of us oldies have been waiting for this for a long time, i cant wait im so excited to see this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been waiting for this for 2 years already. October please come fast
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hell yeah, my dick got hard watching this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 and Pause!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone notice the very first installment when Michael was chasing after lee Curtis while she was tryna get in the house and he was walk-in very slow across the street from the other house ,I think they added that again in this one. 2:16"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,damnn im so ready for this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMGGGG SOOO EXCITED!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg Yes. I wanna see a The Ward Remake now .n.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally some Johnny depp in my life
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie is so savage
ek1ePFp-nBI,And this is why Christmas is my favorite holiday
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg so fk scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did Halloween 2 existed it took place on the same night
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait!!!üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Everytime they come out with another one, i always think its gling to be the last"
ek1ePFp-nBI,All of the Halloween movies have been hillarious to me since i watched the first one in the 5th or 6th grade.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Iceüíä
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""John Wick"" kills the fucken boogie man."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeah fuck you Rob Zombie. This is true Halloween!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Eh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shits getting real
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hate this movie already

ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm under a thick Comforter in 85 degree weather and I still got the chills when they showed the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,What i never understand is people who are put in prison for years then when released or they escape they instantly go back to doing the same thing that put them there haha i know this is a film it just baffles me how true it is
ek1ePFp-nBI,Annie Oakley-Strode.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Terror radius increased.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Better find bigger guns laurie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dogs RIP no.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, Let's hope Universal actually does justice for once. Unlike what they've done with the Mummy & Woody the Woodpecker."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Smh another dam Halloween movie. Let the man Rest in peace already. It looks boring as shit like the rest
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse? John carpenter? Jamie lee curtis? Halloween is back!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To be honest I haven't seen the first one, but I am pretty excited for this one nontheless."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is so savage
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfmKi1MgrsR9lI7FXeIo5JQ?view_as=subscriber
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like this is more action then horror üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer is supposed to be a little snippet not the whole movie üòí i feel like I just saw the whole thing
ek1ePFp-nBI,so i can ill him?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,some teeth for you *m'lady*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, does anyone else but me believe this movie will do so good it‚Äôll spawn an incredibly long range amount of sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't think Activia is going to help this time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,there are not many horror movies this year
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is Back !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs go
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do almost bad poeple wear musks?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This comes out on my birthday. Lol smh, HALLOWEEN is by far the scariest movie series in my lifetime"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Feels like scary suspenseful movies are starting to make a comeback
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael the Most powerful Archangel huh? Dayum
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee curtis is back this has to be good i can't wait for Halloween I'm so hyped!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When Barry Allen did Flashpoint: Paradox, he went back in time and changed the Halloween Universe, mainly erasing ""Halloween II through Rob Zombie's Halloween II"", on a serious note, I'm so fuckin' happy we finally have a horror/slasher film that will be worth waiting for! Welcome Back, Michael! The O.G. that started all this!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Movie Review in seconds,

ek1ePFp-nBI,Testing
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Love it ‚ô•Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't mean to be a downer at all... it's just that there have been so many watered down incarnations of the Michael Myers Character that it's hard to capture the magic and horror of the first film. It seems way too polished now that it looks like it's just going to be another slightly boring catch-penny attempt to recreate what scared us in 1978. If it were my film (which I know it isn't, but) I would have tried to film it on the same type of equipment that was used in 1978. Also, I would only use the mask briefly, and my Michael Myers Character would be an extremely aged, creepy twisted limbed shape with a bald top of his head and sadistic features. (Kind of like that creature in that short film the smiling man) only with no emotion and where one eye drifts off to the side. I'm sorry... I just don't foresee this one being as revered as the first one. However, it is cool that they are attempting to abolish all other of the Halloween Films and make it so this is the direct sequel to the first."
ek1ePFp-nBI,pfft i could survive this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OHH THE OLD LADY IS FREAKING BADASS!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this leather face?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy freaking balls.. this is gonna be awsome
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Laurie has a total of 3 children. When are we gonna see Michaels son again. It would be awesome if they ended the trilogy with his son becoming Michael Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So it‚Äôs not a remake, but a sequel. Interesting"
ek1ePFp-nBI,#MeToo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Imagine being Arnold in that scene and having to be all like ""damn, Jamie Curtis, you fuckin' fine, all sexy with your tight body and horrific androgynous monster face. I would totally have sex with you, both my character and the real me."" when all he really wants to do is fuck another 16 year old in his dressing room. Like seriously imagine having to be Arnold and not only sit in that chair while Jamie Lee Curtis flaunts her disgusting body in front of you, the favorable lighting barely concealing her stretchmarks and leathery skin, and just sit there, take after take, hour after hour, while she perfected that dance. Not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking visage but her haughty attitude as everyone on set tells her she's STILL GOT IT and DAMN, JAMIE LEE CURTIS LOOKS LIKE *THAT*?? because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of blondes and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your ENTIRE CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Austria. You've never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that's breaking out on her dimpled stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in her ""statuesque (for that is what she calls herself)"" beauty, the beauty she worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months. And then the director calls for another take, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking Arnold. You're not going to lose your future political career over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,who got scared at the end!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait üòä

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love the Halloween franchise and this movie looks dope! My only issue? Is that it's just called ""Halloween"" & it's a sequel to the original. If this one gets a sequel, what'll they call it, Halloween 2? that would be 3 Halloween 2's in the series lifespan lol"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone notice someone else in the house in the top left room? At 2:08 ?

ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúCan you close the closet door?‚Äù üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael disappeared at the end of the original... if they were going to have him apprehended they should have just had them do it after he was burned at the end of 2... and now he's not Laurie Strodes brother anymore?  It looks fantastic, but I don't know how I feel about the direction they went in regards to those points..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is going to be lit as Fuck pun intended. :-)
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't be the only person who thought that was Kimmy Schmidt on the shitter?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers vs Jason mmm
ek1ePFp-nBI,They need to make a slashers cinematic universe. Michael will be the Captain America of the slashers Avengers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What about Busta Rhymes?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back! Don't this guy ever take a day off and just decide to go fishing? Hyped!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That's cute, it's gonna be released on his birthday"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is the actress from the original Halloween??? If so this movie already won me over
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else hyped for this?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fuck people are getting excited for Halloween its not even fucking summer yet
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who‚Äôs watched the original Halloween movies too?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Been hearing about this being a ""sequel"" to the original Halloween, the very first one

What, so they scraped and retconned the entire series just to throw an alternate reality sequel?

Or is this suppose to be the REAL sequel that took 40 years to conjure up?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer for a Halloween movie months before octoberüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Michael harms the Dog I'll hunt him down!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sooooo....were supposed to ignore the half dozen other Halloween ""reboots"" ...and sequels that have come out over the respinning the same story  years?....""h20""...""curse of Micheal Myers""....Rob zombies Halloween....Halloween 2...Halloween resurrection...etc....same movie over and over and over again....just repackaged and rereleased every ten years or so...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,That old lady looks like she‚Äôs ready to do one thing she‚Äôs always been waiting forüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks so original! I love it
 üéÉüî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like cheap crap
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does she kill him I hope she does she been waiting for years
ek1ePFp-nBI,When Michael meyers theme song dropped it took me back in the early 2000's lol I'm hella grown now nd this fool still scares the shit outta me lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/LqBr97LWlsw
ek1ePFp-nBI,N o  w a y
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have been waiting for this for ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is ressurection considered noncanon cause Laurie died in that movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guess his house is gonna be at universal studios horror nightsüò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im in with the shape this movie is providing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does this version of Laurie Strode have a right to be this paranoid of Michael's return if she isn't her brother? Why does she assume he will come back to kill her when he has no relation to her in this timeline?
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh fuck am i hype. But is this a remake of the first. I only seen 2 3 and 4
ek1ePFp-nBI,The first Halloween movie timeline has these Halloween movies in it Halloween 1 and 2 and 4 and 5 and 6 and the second timeline or the h20 timeline has Halloween 1 and 2 and h20 and resurrection and there's the rob zombie timeline of Halloween 1 and 2 and there's the third timeline of Halloween which has Halloween 1 and 2 and Halloween 2018 or Halloween 30 years later or 40 I can't remember which.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm literally crying üò≠ I loved these movies to much
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many movies keep adding up in the list üòçüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Two fun facts about this movie:
1. John Carpenter isn't just producing, he's also composing the music, like he used to do with his past movies.
2. The guy playing Myers is the same guy who played him in the original 1978 film, so both Laurie and Michael are truly back for this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Me mum named me after him üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,This was lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she decapitated him on Halloween H20 ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,144 days until Halloween. üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,The new mask is SICK!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I used to cry when I would hear the Halloween theme song to Michael.... so scary üò¢
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why show him the mask that will just make him remember?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*After all these years... We may finally get a GOOD ENDING where Michael Myers is killed for good the right way!*
*That is always my wish for popular Horror icons/killers. For them to have a defeat worth remembering.*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If you look up all these movies coming out in a couple years and this year it will tell you and give you list of some awesome movies that have yet to be released.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm so happy right now. The real Michael returns one last time, I hope this is done RIGHT ü§ûüèΩ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really?? Again!? Wtf?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus jamie lee got old where has the time gone
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a new generation can be terrified by the shape and not just jump scares

ek1ePFp-nBI,does any1 want to fuck my ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,They're just showing us the best parts of the movie. We all know the actual movie will be 90% talk and 10% action.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, this actually looks amazing.  I actually kind of figured that when I heard the name Danny McBride.  Everything he does is gold."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:30 I guess Michael wasn't ready to admit he's gay.
ek1ePFp-nBI,what a dumb looking movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,this shit looks hella good creepy and scary as fuck go micheal myers lol üòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,–•—É–π–Ω—è –ø–æ–ª–Ω–∞—è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh by the way: three? Well fuck that guy he killed to get the jumpsuit then i guess? You could've watched the original movie before doing a sequel you know?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hoping there are plenty of brutal rape scenes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here we go again, again."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am not a fan of how they placed this in the timeline. If anything it should be taking place after 2 not 1. And I guess we are just suppose to ignore all the sequels that followed including H20 where we are introduced to Laurie's son, and part 8 where laurie is killed off. Gonna be a good movie but as far as continuity and plot it is going to suck"
ek1ePFp-nBI,you shouldn‚Äôt be scared of ghosts u should be scared of people who are living.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus...very impressed. It feels like Haddonfield again too. Yep very very very impressed. Nothing will beat Carpenters original but I'm loving this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Closet scene is üëå

ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus that Winchester rifle has like zero recoil
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that the Activia lady?
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The toilet scene where he throws the teeth gives me chills
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can they please just find a timeline and stick with it...
ek1ePFp-nBI,No one can deny the Halloween music is the best score ever!!! Great job John Carpenter
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn that looks awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*I dunno why, but I have a bad feeling about this movie.*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Produced by John Carpenter and staring the queen herself Jamie Lee Curtis. This looks phenomenal!! Sooo excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Trailer Represents Me This Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looka really bad ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should have used the second also. Makes more sense there's a connection between the two
ek1ePFp-nBI,I made first person fortnite video sub to me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Call me close minded but I have not got a good feeling about this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good but the original is still the best Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit it‚Äôs finally here
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's hit 1k. One of my friends said if I get close to hitting 1000 subscribers with no videos he'll give me 10$. I mean $10 is $10

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes I cant fucking wait a true Halloween fan this what I waited for for so long yessss.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I Think I Just Shit My Pants
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Movie was filmed 30 minutes away from me in Charleston, SC. Its crazy how similar the house is compared to the original. Even 2 of my cousins are playing background extra's in the film since they live near charleston. Lets hope this movie is sick."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good though it's a shame parts 2 and 4 are no longer canon.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Glad that Carpenter is back.
Also God bless that Halloween theme song
1:56   üôåüíØ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like this new Dead by daylight live action film
ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM SO EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YEAH PUSSYLICKERS A NEW FUCKING HALLOWEEN MOVIE!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow I never expected this to be sooo good. Can‚Äôt wait. Brilliant trailer. That opening sequence gave me chills.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Here when its #1 on trending!
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"We haven't seen the true Michael Myers since 1978, this is the movie he came home..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 Why the hell was there a Pingu NOOT NOOT????? XD
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT IM ACTUALLY EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,This isn't going to be scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,"* casually scrolling through youtube *
* sees this * 
OH SHIT"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back. I can¬¥t believe it!!! This movie will be epic!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He‚Äôs been in prison for 40 years... how old is this man he should be in his 60s+, he should be pretty easy to fight...ü§î"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I need someone to please explain this to me. If he was held captive for 40 years after being shot by his therapist how the hell was the other Michael Myers movies made? Oh and wasn't the 2nd Michael Myers the one where she was in the hospital the same night he got burned in the hospital?? They should have started it from there. It would explain why his skin looks so burned and old.
ek1ePFp-nBI,üò±üò®üò±üò®
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool I am forward to seeing this :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks so good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OOHHH *SHIT!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,happy Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to watch this movie so bad right know
ek1ePFp-nBI,Heh heh heeehh!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love how it truly feels like Halloween 2 as it technically is, and Warlock vibes big time out of James Jude who plays Michael I love that"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So he kills the man and the women who came and showed him his mask and was able to get his mask back. Well played Mikey üëåüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why call it just ""Halloween""? So when you say that is what you are watching, nobody is going to know what you are referring to."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great. Can't wait to see it. So does this movie take place after Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"She did kill him so wtf is this shit??
She killed him in Halloween h20 by chopping off his freaking head!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Booooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter!!! need I say more. That theme tho
ek1ePFp-nBI,With it sounding so good a part of me hopes we see even more films made it is this gonna be it now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Your Dead Meat?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't like the fact that they're abandoning them being brother and sister. Just feels like something is missing without that connection. They should of picked up the story after Halloween 2.

But...That trailer was freaking awesome. Can't wait to see it!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,anyone know what he said at 1.13??????
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No Busta Rhymes ? ü§î
Worst Movie ever, 2 of 10 üòÖ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie looks nice and scary. ...John Carpenter had a hand in this I will definitely go to the theater to see this...

ek1ePFp-nBI,I would watch all of his movies BIG FAN
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess people only get mad when the remake is all female üò¨
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot wait for Halloween to arrive!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The terror returns I can't wait for this movie it's looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I know I‚Äôm a get a lot of hate for this, but um.......































































































































































































I‚Äôm gay"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks better than what rob zombie tried to do
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope that this is gonna be good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has the potential to kick start another golden age for slasher movies. It could lead to a revive of Friday the 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street. Chucky has still been going strong and so has hatchet. Texas Chainsaw Massacre had a recent movie. Maybe we'll get another scream movie one day.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mr. Sandman ...... bring me a treat.
ek1ePFp-nBI,teenagers a nutter with a knife..how original
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks...good... WTF??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait so if Halloween 2 never happened does that mean Ben Tramer never died?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm so happy that Laurie and Michael aren‚Äôt siblings now, it always dragged down the series and made him a less scary villain"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well my rival gets a movie and not me 
:("
ek1ePFp-nBI,Check out my mixer.    Diamond_Dusty99
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuckkk, I was gonna go eat icecream and its night, but this made me scared.. i guess no ice cream"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it‚Äôs almost like Friday the 13th
ek1ePFp-nBI,One word... EPIC!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So sad that people look forward to Halloween fuck that make that shit in the summer!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,JUST KILLE THE MF GODDAMN

ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope this movie isn't gonna be shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"THE RETURN OF SLASHERS, WOOHOO!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks good--don't fuck it up to cater to the retarded short attention span having high school audience;)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where is the nun???
ek1ePFp-nBI,I do like the fact that it looms like it's true to the older ones as well as the mask...BUT I'm getting the vibe of it's a movie I've already seen. We'll have to wait and see!
ek1ePFp-nBI,weird but interesting
ek1ePFp-nBI,"'78 Halloween & '81 Halloween 2 were essentially one Movie. Not a bad story line this time Around,But I could Never forget being a Child watching Mike get shot,Camera peering over the banister & BOOM no Micheal ! Timeless"

ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else is gonna wank the whole month of October for the last time in a month in November just me...? Ok...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"maybe she ends up losing it at the end, thinking he could be anywhere. maybe they take her away and he is still around. then maybe sequel"
ek1ePFp-nBI,ME PUSO NERVIOSO
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Carpenter is back on? This should be good. (not saying Rob Zombie‚Äôs were bad, the first one was ok for a bit of an origin story. Then it got REALLY hokey)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHITTTTTT
ek1ePFp-nBI,If only Donald Pleasence were here to see it. I know Jamie Lee Curtis will do a good job coming back as Laurie Storde.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they filmed it in So Pasadena! The original Halloween was filmed there
ek1ePFp-nBI,That ending made me laugh out loud.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:35 When your friend reminds you bout the high five y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt do

ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg this flick looks wild. I really hope it does well. I‚Äôm just a little nervous that they had to reshoot the ending but hopefully it‚Äôs for the better. And also they shouldn‚Äôt just call it Halloween since it IS technically a sequel. Laurie‚Äôs Revenge!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What‚Äôs next ‚ÄúJaws 6‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know this sounds bad but I hope they make more Halloween movies after this one

ek1ePFp-nBI,what i never could understand about the whole Halloween franchise is the fact he is a normal person just a fucking psycho and for some reason he is literally indestructible haha he just can not be killed i don‚Äôt get it! hopefully he will actually die in this film...
ek1ePFp-nBI,what does the cop say at 1:13 i cant understand
ek1ePFp-nBI,Judy Greer is everywhere.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael better level up his bloodweb if he is gonna kill that many people
ek1ePFp-nBI,YOOOOOOOOOO THATS SOME CRAZY SHIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This was a good trailer,  the last reboot was a little messy but this got me hooked  and the theme hits you know bodies are going to start dropping."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Still one of the creepiest soundtracks in cinema, along with the exorcist and the thing. 
So is this a continuation or a reboot? Either way, I'm pretty excited for this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let it go. How many of these can we tolerate
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:35 When you bout to close the door but your friend says the pizza rolls are ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love this movie already but only thing I‚Äôm scared about is if they are gonna kill Michael for good cause u cant kill a legend like Michael Myersü§îüò®
ek1ePFp-nBI,YOOOOO MAN MICHEL LOOKS FRESH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by daylight : Halloween chapter.. Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,killer vs grandma lets gooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,death match   leather face  vs. Michael myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,he shot and killed 3 people ? i thought michael doesn‚Äôt use guns...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fun fact: The guy playing Myers is the same one in 1978 and he directed the classic comedy Dennis the Menace. I feel older poitning this out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is going to be a great movie,‡ºº(‚à© Õ°¬∞‚ï≠Õú ñ‚ïÆÕ° Õ°¬∞)‡ºΩ‚äÉ‚îÅ‚òÜÔæü. * ÔΩ• ÔΩ°Ôæü"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this is a comedy, right?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mom what bus crash?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really hope they don't make Laurie and Michael siblings again in this movie.  I wasn't against the plot twist in Halloween 2 like everyone else, but I admit that it does take away from the mystery.  I just want the reason for why Michael is going after Laurie is because she got away from him.  It's like an obsession that just can't be explained, similar to the reason why he killed his sister can never be explained.

On a side note, I'm upset that they didn't bring back Danielle Harris as Jamie Loyd.  If they can bring back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Stroke (twice), without canon being involved, then why not Danielle as Jaime?  The woman obviously wants to return as the character for a final performance.  Give her a chance at that!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm down to watch this
ek1ePFp-nBI,i cant believe trailer is finally here
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is a reboot then ? Seperate from the rob zombie ones ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This the only reason I want October to *HURRY THE FUCK UP*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is really bringing it for this movie wow.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Se viene lo bueno hauevo tanto tiempo espere este momento
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hate how all the trailers nowadays have a super suspenseful and loud first 5 seconds, shows title, then slowly explains the whole plot. Literally it's every trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder when this comes out...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Never really got into the Halloween series. It was kinda boring
ek1ePFp-nBI,That Rob Zombie crap almost killed this franchise!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus christ this looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,for creating A Movie Like This HOW MUCH WILL I GET
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers has been shot at least a dozen  or so times (twice in the eye sockets), stabbed, electrocuted, set aflame, AND decapited.. dude has crazy HP!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People might think I am crazy, but I already oredered the 2018 mask from Trick or Treat studios, and I am wearing the mask and uniform to the movies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter ?!! This movie is going to be good ! Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,A lever-action rifle and a revolver in 2018?¬† YOU DESERVE TO DIE IN THIS MOVIE¬†JAMIE LEE CURTIS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she died ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,So if Michael got locked up for 40 years so who did all the killings while he was locked up and didn't Laurie get killed?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Esto es una pel√≠cula de terror, no las de ahora que son todas hechas por computadora."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally.. we get another Halloween!.... ... said no one ever

ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm waiting for this one for a long time....
ek1ePFp-nBI,If you're gonna slam that door another time on my face..i'm gonna lose itüòÇ.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How come his mask now looks like Mickey Rourke?

But hey, i will totaly watch it"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome his back
ek1ePFp-nBI,So garbage.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The old lady didn't lose her mind, she shot the bad guy's reflection in the mirror"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pam !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks great but it revealed way too much
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know no one will read his but if you can check out my twitch channel SoloItachi702 I do all different type of gaming & love meeting new people
ek1ePFp-nBI,Eh.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1978 Michael Myers created a Halloween horror to remember for all time. 
1981 His sister was taken to a hospital and ever since then he has been gone, missing. Believed to be dead. BUT NOW HE'S BACK!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Carpenter is back ;)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt even recognize her!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"3.2 million views..ok.. but if you could count replays and rewinds, we're looking at about 20 million in 1 day AT LEAST."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grab a friend or 3 and let's support the fuck out of this movie and get the series back up and running. The studio needs to know we're here.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I miss original Dr Loomis he was such a bad ass may he RIP one of the best actors on the series !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can u just finish the damn story. U are really just making pointless sequels which means that u are, clearly, running out of ideas. Yea, we all love Halloween, but this doesn't make any sense. Whenever Michael die, u just in a next movie *somehow* revive (or put him out of jail), and its getting so obvious and disconnected. U should've finnish the story looong time ago - and stay it that way. This is just becoming more and more cringy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,C‚Äôest tellement g√©niale !!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ooooooooooooooooooooooof
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just realized that at 2:08 he's looking outside through a mirror
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maybe....a scene or two in this trailer looks like it might be a maybe.....but most of the trailer looks like this may be a great ride.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anybody else catch that Danny McBride is one of the writers lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ultimate throwback!!! I dig it!!! Now bring us Jason next!!!haha
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well I know what everyone's gonna be for  Halloween üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ooo im so excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,The end of the trailer scared the shit out of me cuz my phone was so damn close to my face
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Actually kinda impressed, doesn't look like a shitty cash in.

Hope they dwell on the character of Michael, thats the one thing rob zombie got right"
ek1ePFp-nBI,turkleri gorek
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah!
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hmmm another reboot? Fuck man I‚Äôm lost af!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I swear I hate how scared I get when the music comes on, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm 9 again and scared of seeing these movies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why we NEED ar-15
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is going to be one of the best in the series most likely the last Halloween to be ever made so let's hope they took there time with it and made it worth all these years of waiting !
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt freakin wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,another bad horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait.... So this a sequel to the first one? Part 2 was awesome though. It was a nice expansion to the first movie. I thought this was gonna be a ""Part 3"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hollywood needs to let some movies die. This film was already remade more than once. Smh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay
After IT‚Äôs success they are going to milk other B class horror movies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is he like 90 y/o already?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn this shit got 3 million views already ? I can imagine when it releases
ek1ePFp-nBI,The mask looks awesome. I love the Halloween movies and this straight up looks classic
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:28 - 2:37 XD What? Even M. Myers can't meme too once in awhile?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"SO WAIT, if this is a direct sequel to the original halloween, shouldnt it be called halloween 2? Or at the very least not have the exact same title as the movie its a sequel to??"
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://discord.gg/8PjH9G7 join the jeff server
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well here we go again
ek1ePFp-nBI,The end scared me
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanna watch it with my mom but she says she's too scared üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is my birthday. Looks like a perfect gift for me!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1. That old lady is badass.
2. That closet scene at the end was great"
ek1ePFp-nBI,it looks so so good! so freaking excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/EqQuihD0hoI
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait for these dumb kids of our generation to not know who this iconic horror-character is... Pls don't tell me this gets as overhyped as ""IT"" by kids"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I will give y'all 1k a piece or a free iPhone X just watch my video to 1 million views the name is KD Savage III I'm on YouTube
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Does anyone know where I can find a snippet of the sound effect at 1:59? (Myers runs into the two kids and what sounds like hot steam is released.) I know it was used in previous movies and even in DBD when playing as him, I just can't find videos of it let alone an isolated version."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is why we need the second amendment.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so legit just help me get to 1 million views
ek1ePFp-nBI,Haha Dead by Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just in time for Mortal Kombat 11
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He freaking died in ""H2O."" His bust was smashed and his head cut off. His freaking none existing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,so epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Me La Pierdo Por Nada Del Mundo Una De Mis Favoritas Helloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look up KD Savage III and listen to my songs to get paid
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, is this movie a sequel to the original franchise?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michaels home welcome we missed you üòàüòàüòà‚ò†Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just realized, this is going to be the 3rd entry in this series called ""Halloween"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,so is this like a reboot or is it a sequel to the reboot? or the original? I'm confused
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look up KD Savage III and help me get to 1 million views I will pay all y'all
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay that closet door scene was just hilarious
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks creepy!
ek1ePFp-nBI,They seriously couldn‚Äôt come up with a better plot then the cliche bus crashing and the killer escaping? This also looks like it is clinging onto nostalgia too much to sell this movie. Also who the hell wants to see a sequel to a movie that came out years ago. I would have been happier with a reboot. This is just as nostalgia cash grab
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is not something you should watch at night with your closet door open
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahh I can't wait to see this!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie needs to be done with these movies: Keep Her Out. Give her work behind the camera.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Proof a good guy with a gun is useless against a bad guy with a knife.

ek1ePFp-nBI,it has the oldschool feel to it i love it!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought laurie strode died in Halloween resurrection. Must have survived being stabbed in the gut and falling off the top of the mental hospital and in the trees
ek1ePFp-nBI,I must admit that the theme is very catchy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Considering she slams the closet door against the guy a couple of times and then he comes out about to stab her, like damn, I'd be pissed too if someone hit me in the face over and over again"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The part where she couldnt close the closet door üòÇüòÇüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I would prefer if they went with Halloween 3 direction, you know setting stories during Halloween but so far, it looks decent even though its the same story over and over again."

ek1ePFp-nBI,who needs activia when i can mud my panties here.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh yea, this looks so good an about time.. Thank you"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael is what, 46 years old?  Not really that intimidating anymore. Jamie lee Curtis already had a show down with her brother in the last good Halloween movie. 3 teenagers is an insulting low kill count for Michael Myers. Is this film following the first movie or part 2, which was the same night?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,My dad is soooo scared of Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yes

ek1ePFp-nBI,Time to ruin a horror franchise.......again!

ek1ePFp-nBI,oh no :( another classic that will be killed by a terrible reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They should make a cinematic universe for horror/slasher killer movies. Like Jason, Freddy, Micheal, Pinhead, Leatherface, Chucky etc. It would be really interesting."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait can't f'n wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs get itt
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't he already died?!?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,As a kid in the 80‚Äôs I wasn‚Äôt scared of Jason or Freddy but I was terrified of Michael and that mask his demeanor and his movements along with that Legendary music made me a fan of the Halloween trilogy
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be better than IT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dope!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Meyer's if you dont leave this lady alone already.

ek1ePFp-nBI,This honestly looks pretty good. Feels like the original. Not expecting the best thing ever just a good Halloween movie. We shall seeeee.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this just came out at 10:00 am, friday eastern std time."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yo, this bout to be some good ass shit. I cannot wait to see this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:10 Torstejn is that you?! What are you doing fighting Michael White?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok hear me out about the teeth dropped over the bathroom stall scene ... I dont feel like that is a Michael Myers thing to do at all. Maybe a Rob Zombie Michael Myers but not first Halloween Michael Myers. That Michael didn't seek out taunting his victims like that to scare them... he just wanted to kill you... why... no reason. This gives him a personality of taking pleasure in taunting his victims like a sadist. My impression of Halloween was he never felt anything but rather just killed to kill and an evil curiosity like his head tilt in the first film after he kills the boy and leaves him pinned up in the air to a wall by his knife. This changes his ""original"" character completely in my opinion. Thoughts?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Everyone subscribe to me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh buh no freddy Kruger or jason movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Merry Christmas!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't look as good as previous versions
ek1ePFp-nBI,O mai got
ek1ePFp-nBI,Letss goo where all my Halloween fanatics
ek1ePFp-nBI,Friday the 13th is coming next I call it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôve been following this movie all the way since 2010 when a working title was Halloween 3D and Halloween Returns.

To get John Carpenter‚Äôs attention like this, and for him to THOROUGHLY enjoy the script and wanting to come back to Halloween after he swore to never ever do a sequel or anything like that relating to Halloween, I personally think it‚Äôs going to be one hell of a movie.

This won‚Äôt be one of those ‚ÄúThe Purge‚Äù moments or fake horror films. This will be a great homage to what Carpenter started back in ‚Äò78 with Halloween.

(And the reason why I mentioned Carpenter coming onto the project because of the script is because Carpenter has always been picky about scripts and about horror movies in general)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can wait to see this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yea hyped all ready !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Surely  now being old as fuck and with crippling back pain and maybe arthritis he would and should be easy to out run and should be set in a retirement home
ek1ePFp-nBI,watch the old lady is gonna die but prob kill Michael while at it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this doesn't suck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she died
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg yes yes I wanted to watch this movie it's been a long time since the reboot of 2009 but it's finally back I wanna watch it who's excited for Halloween in 2018 and yes Michael Myers is back in glad to see it back in 1978 to the 2018 im happy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she cut his head off with an ax in the last one when he was pinned between the car and a tree.
ek1ePFp-nBI,MY OLDEST DAUGHTER  & I WILL BE AT DA THEATER LOADED WITH SNACKZ & READY#HALLOWEEN 2018 BABYYYYYYYüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Movie + ""I KNOW WHAT THAT IS!!"" = $$$"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love it can't wait to watch it! It doesn't make sense when compared to the old original series bt hey still interesting cuz laurie strode is back and better. Jamie Lee curtis will always be #1 scream queen and bad ass surviver
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is the best of world <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woo Hoooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a rob zombie movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait for a dead meat kill count on this series...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is he going to Hell where he belongs. Who actually died her or the shape.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Film only takes place after the first film.
So the only thing somewhat supernatural about him now is the fact he survived being shot 6 times with a Revolver.
I like this change."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Would have been better in October
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good job of showing too much of the movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one who's hearing Black ops 1 theme üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMFG THIS IS ACUALLY HAPPENING OMFG HOLY SHIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is mike Myers supernatural or is he a normal human being
ek1ePFp-nBI,All I'm saying is THAT DOG BETTER NOT DIE!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So happy John Carpenter is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want to watch this so much. My mom is strict about horror movies so I probably won't see this for a while.
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oof
ek1ePFp-nBI,bro can you even imagine if somebody dropped fresh teeth in front of you while u was taking a Dukey
ek1ePFp-nBI,I only know him because of playing dead by daylight and michael myers is my fcking favorite killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Miguel vs Jason needs to be a thing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else is gonna be at the movies as soon as it comes out? üî•üéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im going to go benj wacth the previous movies now lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe if they had something different (costume, plot or even movie title) i would be more intrigued"
ek1ePFp-nBI,free Tommy Robinson stop pediphilia in British govt
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sigh why we never got  michael vs Jason....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer starts getting reallyx100 good at 1:32
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The Shape returns to Haddonfield once more. It‚Äôs so cool that Nick Castle, the very first Michael Myers is once again reprising his role. He hasn‚Äôt played the character in 40 years. The OG Michael is back guys. I‚Äôm over the moon"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is trash. Its like they took scenes from all of the original sequels and made one movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So it's a sequel to Halloween, and it's called Halloween... :|"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Get him Jaime!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,3 million views already
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so much better than any of the previous ones
ek1ePFp-nBI,it's not gonna be released on halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"looks pretty good, way better than rob zombie's movies. it just better not be danny mcbride underneath the mask though. the whole franchise would be ruined if michael myers take's his mask off, and danny mcbride is there making wise cracks"
ek1ePFp-nBI,aaawww sh*t here we go!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Brasil!!!!444
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Home girl got some real balls, calling out for Micheal and shit....I'll pray for her."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only actually scary killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,JAMIE'S BACK OH MY GOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,What do u guys think this movie should be rated. Rated pg-13 or R. I personally think pg-13. That‚Äôs by I‚Äôm 16 lol when I was like 8 yrs old I watched the original and the rest of the movies. Rob zombie‚Äôs movie was ass though. To gory for me lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's good to give this classic a fresh retelling and squash all the supernatural and terminator-like character b.s. For those who don't like it... Get over it. This was made to erase all the movie can't be killed crap that eventually tired us of horror movie franchises. I've been a fan and got tired myself of it. And for those who can't believe that a 60 year old person can still be as evil as fuck... Remember Las Vegas. He was around that age too.
ek1ePFp-nBI,See THE SHAPE broken and thrown away!  That is until the night HE came home.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoa yeah Halloween 40 yrs later it's already got box office smash written all over it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh I am done. I feel I just saw the movie. üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is this movie not happened after H2 then H1? So we would have a trilogy...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"God Damn you, Michael! (Loomis Voice) I‚Äôm hearing we might be getting a CGI Loomis for the intro to the film. As Loomis and Police apprehend Michael. (Fingers crossed)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Number one on trending baby
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is definitely gonna blow up like IT did last year
ek1ePFp-nBI,They could called it micheal returns
ek1ePFp-nBI,She supposed to be dead.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes! But I still want a Friday the 13th one doe
ek1ePFp-nBI,Happy Halloween!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh god this doesnt look good :((

ek1ePFp-nBI,DADDY MYERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, WHY Halloween 2 is ignored? Why? Jaime Lee Curtis must be desperate to dust off this plot. the whole point of H20 was to finally put it to rest."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks pretty good tho I‚Äôm confused is it a sequel or a different timeline movie is this Halloween 9? Or Halloween reborn?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks like a good remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear to god if this doesn't come out on Halloween I'm going to kill myself
ek1ePFp-nBI,Imagine if somebody just tapped you on the shoulder while watching this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ayeeeeüí¶üí¶ü§§

So: Blum house productions is doing it and I'm so proud!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So if they aren‚Äôt brother and sister anymore what makes him target Laurie specificity like what‚Äôs his deal with her, because I think them being siblings is a good story to tell since he got abused as a child and he just wants rid of his family"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHATS NEXT Beverly Hills Chihuahua vs Halloween look up Jamie Lee Curtis casting role you‚Äôll get a laugh

ek1ePFp-nBI,Spooky stuff dudes -JoeysWorldTour
ek1ePFp-nBI,More of the same tbh
ek1ePFp-nBI,They better not use those exaggerated sound effects for Jump Scares because the old Halloween was very good and it didn't need sound effects to scare us.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs all bow down to grandma badass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only thing I hate about the Halloween movie is the lack of continuity. But I'm fucking excited.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why are they making a reboot of a movie that already has a reboot?
ek1ePFp-nBI,horror movies aren't scary anymore they are fun to watch
ek1ePFp-nBI,Although im not a huge fan of some of the changes they have seemed to make(micheal not being laurie‚Äôs brother etc) i still am looking forward to this movie and have high hopes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I heard Laurie strode seeks the help of busta rhymes in this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I mean,I like it. But I really enjoyed the first Rob Zombie movie. They just fucked it up in the sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So if im not mistaking this is after part 2 1981 film this is gonna be epic cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I mean, bitch all he wanted to do was to take care of ur dumb ass but you just had to go and try to kill him..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Its june though wtf
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You'd think that there would be a ton of local and state police officers out since a mass murderer just went missing, and this town is the first logical place he would go."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So Halloween 2,4,5 never happened if they changed the story of Halloween instead of him getting up after getting shot 6 times and going to the hospital looking for Laurie. That night he got arrested instead, and was in prison for 40 Years and also did Laurie still have Jamie?ü§î"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If he runs at any point in this movie..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck ya
ek1ePFp-nBI,so glad to see John carpenter come back to fix this franchise

ek1ePFp-nBI,I really like that they're retconning _all_ the sequels and taking that contrived brother-sister relationship they pulled out of their arse for _Halloween II_ with it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man I‚Äôm so hyped for this !!!!! October can‚Äôt get here fast enough
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this like an alternate universe where Halloween 2 didn't happen and Michael was caught and sent to a mental asylum and *WASNT* some long haired dump truck?

ek1ePFp-nBI,"a 3rd reboot, fuck man.. originality died with this generation."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else would smoke a blunt with Michael Myers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Meh, not into this type of horror."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this is good :( The original Halloween is my all time favorite movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like it could be decent, just wish they didnt age the mask like its a person (dont get me wrong the mask looks amazing but its kinda dumb when they say remember this? And its a total different mask than when The Shape had it in 1978) and they shouldnt have excluded Halloween 2"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Also Michael's older then Laurie so he should either be dead or a super old man
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awwwww yeeeeeeeeeaaawwwww fuck Blumhouse
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it pretty much skipped all the movies besides the 1st original one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessssss it actually looks good #HALLOWEEN

ek1ePFp-nBI,Its going to be a good Halloween! Love this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,That shit goes crazy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This shit is nostalgic. I remember when I was a kid watching this, I still have his mask till this day. This is gonna be amazing!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is essentially an alternate sequel.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blyat
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im going to watch this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well damn üëçüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,omfg.michael myers back

ek1ePFp-nBI,The blackest eyes....the devils eyes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It takes place 40yrs after the first Halloween movie...everything after the first movie is non canon...just to clear the confusion
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like a good throwback.. thank you writers!! I hope this does well for the sake of Horror and Danny McBride! Can't wait!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh great I can't wait to see how Hollywood ruins this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet bit was something out of a Scary Movie spoof lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks surprisingly good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wait im lost, someone explain i thought her character was killed off?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,For me boogie man is John Wick.
ek1ePFp-nBI,first it was Freddy then Chucky then Jason then Penny and now Da double M
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK yeah!!! Micheal NEVER DIES!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,hell¬†of¬†a¬†week¬†for¬†trailers...now¬†where's¬†aquaman?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'd be pissed too if you kept closing the door on my face
ek1ePFp-nBI,*BIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTCCCCCCCHHHHHHHH*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This trailer alone feels like the 1st movie, the long wide panning shots, the tension building of that knowing the person is going to die but it still scares you anyway."
ek1ePFp-nBI,YOOOO LETS FUCKING GO IVE BEEN WAITING ON THIS FOR SO LONG.. YOO
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*The Climax, Bob Ross comes and paints a Happy Little Tree..*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully this one isn't garbage like the others after part 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1.7k of Gay!!!!! Fuck y'all, Fuck all Y'all, It's Michael."

ek1ePFp-nBI,New cs go knife animation at 2:04
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeah ill stick with heriditary
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's summer why now start talking about Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,So basically in this sequel only the first movie happened? THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR BEN TRAMOR!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Woo hoo. Jamie Lee Curtis is back! Also Nick Castle, the ORIGINAL Michael Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just to make things clear for some of the people that are confused.

Laurie Strode is alive because this takes place after the 1978 movie. It's a direct sequel to the original. None of the other movies matter here. They're making it that Michael was captured that night, 40 years ago, and he's been in prison ever since.

This is going to change some of the mythos of the story. Him being this type of supernatural immortal being is gone, along with him being Laurie's brother."
ek1ePFp-nBI,About FUCKING time!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amen
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm scared hiding under my bed watching thiss
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is such a good movie to watch üòùüòù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't her character die in The beginning of Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Look at all the dislikes on here. Reminds me of what happened when Ghostbusters (2016) came out. Not a good sign, and I think it's because it's confusing the Hell out of some people. The Shape deserves better than this. Dammit, I knew this would happen. Let this series rest, and bring some talent aboard that can set this ship right for once."
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is still kick ass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,"October is the month on which 3 movies are releasing  : Venom , Mowgli And this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hol up. Isn't Michael Myers way older than Laurie? How tf hasn't he aged at all and is still killing even tho he old as shit. He must be immortal or somethin
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now we need a reboot Jason movie and Freddy movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ayyy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here, let‚Äôs give this psycho killer his old mask that he wore when he murdered people!  I bet he‚Äôll be all nostalgic and reminisce over the glory days of back when he was an active killer!!!  this can‚Äôt possibly turn out poorly."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I knew Michael Myers would come sooner or later...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Childhood
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo bitch shut the closet for me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so scared
ek1ePFp-nBI,See what I don't get is if this a direct sequel and Michael was taken into custody after being shot by Loomis how are they gonna explain when he disappered afetr he fell off the balcony? Either way I'm still going to watch this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have been waiting for this my entire life
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hyyyppe
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg I‚Äôm so excited for this üëÄüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm fucking excited!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*OH YEAH*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dude got his head cut off and still gets to come back. lol Pass. You have to be a fuckin imbecile to fall for this repeat. After it bombs, it'll fade like so many other horror stretches."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve never watched any of the Halloween‚Äôs all the way through....I was always too scared smh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"knowing that it was with blumhouse, I'm freaking nervous while watching this trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,*This* is Halloween!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Before 3 million
ek1ePFp-nBI,For ounce I‚Äôm scared of a recent horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this after the original halloween or the reboot ones?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a new movie or a sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I fucking LOVE how they slipped in the line where it was stated that Laurie and Michael being brother and sister was made up. So slick, but effective!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck it, I'll watch just because J L Curtis is in it, and she helped me get regular with Activia."
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY another Halloween movie. Jesus Christ took them long enough.
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH HELL YEAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can anyone say how many fantastic trailers released these week

ek1ePFp-nBI,"So when people watch this movie, which Halloween will people consider cannon in their opinion? This is technically a reboot of the original Halloween II, considering it now ignores H2 onwards."
ek1ePFp-nBI,We're fucked

ek1ePFp-nBI,"After a long time, I'm really hyped for the new horror movie, because 99% of trailers for horrors are teenage shits... I'm  so excited and I hope, it's gonna be good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael is scarier because he's more realistic, unlike Freddy Krueger or other iconic killers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is basically like terminator 2 of the horror genre
ek1ePFp-nBI,The legendary is back! #halloween #MichaelMyers is back prepare this Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,really?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope the bad guy wins in this movie.

ek1ePFp-nBI,yay..he's coming back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Movies like this always manage to come up with suuuuuper creative titles but this one really takes the cake in my opinion
ek1ePFp-nBI,"looks good,but what happened to having Josh Harnit back,for the knife box series,deff make another one,ahh fresh air to see a well done sequel even without seeing it yet"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times will they remake this film???
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanna eat Michael's ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Aren‚Äôt really many remakes/reboots that look good anymore, but dammnnnn does that trailer give me chills"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael never dies he's not human . He's what u call the definition of pure evil. The boogie man is coming back this halloween.

ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times she killed this ninja
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great film.. shame about Spider-Man and gamora :(
ek1ePFp-nBI,I LOVE YOU MICHAEL
ek1ePFp-nBI,All time favorite serial killer #MICHAELMYERS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So..... he‚Äôs coming out of the closet? Damn politics! Stay out of my movies! 
You already ruined Star Wars 
& Predator 2018 now this?!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Una mierda se ve que va ha ser la pelicula pero igual la vere v:
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Danny McBride, dude you‚Äôre my hero!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HE'S BACK !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wanted another Halloween movie.  Hopefully where everything comes to a resolution and Michael Myers dies.  I just feel like they should've picked up after Laurie's death in Resurrection, with Josh Hartnett being her son again, Michelle Williams being his wife, and they have a family that puts an end to Mike once and for all.  Sort of a send off victory for Laurie through her bloodline.  Hell, they probably could've done gotten two movies out of that plot.  I'm sort of disappointed that they decided to go this route though.  But I'm a huge fan of the franchise in general.  Minus the Rob Zombie releases.  Sorry.  I'm not hating, but I just wasn't feeling them.  Myers was made too ""larger than life"" in those movies in my opinion.  But because I'm a fan, I'll be definitely be giving this one a chance."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else hears the black ops zombie theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,mothers day the official trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok so now Michel soon Jason, Freddy, Leatherface, and Ash. Then   I can die happy. All of this is thanks to It 2017 and I am happy bc of it see watch i did there. Let's hope they are all good and terrifying"
ek1ePFp-nBI,the sequel that the original deserved
ek1ePFp-nBI,You waited for him Laurie' so have we.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael can live in my closet any day.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Question is who is going to die ü§îü§îüòä
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Lory is a badass now
ek1ePFp-nBI,GOOSEBUMPS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So the other movies are what non canonical now? Then why did they bring up the babysitter's who got murdered? They are talking about things that they no longer want us to believe happened but they are telling us they happened. You can't just erase the history of Halloween, it's too late for that. This just seems like a bad idea. Zombie's first Halloween film should have been where it ended. That was an awesome remake, his sequel? Not so much."
ek1ePFp-nBI,When the first 7 seconds of the trailer are actually a trailer for the trailer...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this actually looks promising.
ek1ePFp-nBI,when does it come out!!!! Halloween?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm 12 and I don‚Äôt know why everyone is hyped about this movie

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Loving how much of a badass development Laurie has here, she‚Äôs got the reaction I think many of us would have if we went through what she did. This is how you do a new movie, no more running, they‚Äôre both thirsting for each other‚Äôs blood."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny McBride almost blinded Jaimie Lee Curtis in Freaky Friday.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dam she has that Winchester rifle awesome

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 to be continued meme
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not a big fan that they are disregarding all other sequels, some of which even featured Jamie Lee Curtis, I felt like they could have made this and still reference the other sequels with the exception of maybe halloween: resurrection"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hmmmm...I swear I've seen this movie already. =3
ek1ePFp-nBI,another shitty remake

ek1ePFp-nBI,POPCOOOORRRRNNNNNN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is like 60 years old now. That makes Michael Myers 70ish. Michael Myers is a literal old man doing all this shit in this film. Digest that.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I signed up to be an extra in this film, sucks they were filming in South Carolina while I was in school in New York. This looks incredible."

ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM SO READY FOR THIS!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE JAMIE LEE CURTIS BACK IN ACTION.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hasn‚Äôt this been done before...several times?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't get why they aren't related anymore. What is the point of coming back just to kill her? Her family were just real estate agents for Michael's house. They didn't live there. I am assuming she is not the main target in this movie, since they stripped all that away.
Also, why is she still expecting him to come back after 40 years, and hoping that he escapes? I get that her friends died, but the last thing you would want is a serial killer to escape and possibly kill others. 
I was not a big fan of Rob Zombie's versions (though the dream hospital scene was great), so I am sure this will be way better than that. I just don't see the point though. I'm still watching it. LOL"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"One thing that i love about this movie particularly is how the styled the mask, Christopher Nelson and Vincent Van Dyke did amazing on the makeup to trying to make the mask old as possible. It is better than Rob Zombies because this mask actually looks like it is 40 years old."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Best upcoming movie/movie strailer since October 25th 1978
ek1ePFp-nBI,U know it‚Äôs gonna be good becuz Blum house is producing the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Isn‚Äôt the boogeyman John wick?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He killed four people in Halloween not three. He killed the mechanic who's jumpsuit he stole. I'm not at all impressed with this version of ""Halloween."" I think ignoring ""Halloween 2"" was a huge mistake. A geriatric Michael Myers isn't at all scary. ""Halloween"" is my favorite horror film of all time. There is no way this film is going to hold up to the original. It's just going to be another hack job with another open ending. This will not be the last sequel and they'll end up going down the road of ridiculousness again, until ten years from now when they re-imagine another unwatchable sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I guess they could go through the other movies like they were  nightmares she was having. I don't know. To ignore 100 other movies is quite dumb, without some kind of explanation."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Myers my boi
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im pretty sure Halloween is not this month
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is going to be crazy can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,i'm disappointed it's not being realized on october 31st
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see this! One of the creepiest slashers ever.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ah...the famous bathroom stall scene...I'm actually excited to see this movie even though there's been so many because I'm so sick of demon possession horror crap now days..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who is Going to be Michael Myers in this One
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is a reboot or a sequel??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They deleted the comment that I made that got everybody talking? Are you kidding me?!?!?!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs go finally been waiting a long ass time!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im going to be the first one to watch this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else thinks its funny how Michael Myers was just standing there getting hit by a door over and over.
ek1ePFp-nBI,br aqui?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why won't he just die
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt Jamie lee Curtis die in the Halloween series ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks stupid as hell
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bro who wants some free vbucks dm me instagram :narcofunds
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait..........Rob zombie isn't part of this?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:36...okay, that did scare the baa-jeebers out of me....."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I swear they need to do a Hellraiser, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, and a Nightmare on Elm Street crossover."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YES YES YES, YES! YES......Yes?.....Nah.. YES-YES!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,so does this take place after rob zombies' halloween 2? Or is this just going to be a shitty blumehouse remake to take place after the original movies? (The reason I say shitty is because of the teen actors... common...we all know they're gonna be bad..)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just don't see Michael as someone that would drop teeth to ""taunt."" He wasn't a taunter. Just soulless machine, a shape, THE Shape. Hopefully he doesn't call Laurie with a voicechanger saying, ""Hello, Laurie. Do you like Halloween?"" üòë  Then again, he did place the bodies strategically at the end of the first one so maybe I'm wrong."

i get the feeling from watching the trailer thst michael is not fucking around!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love everything but I hate that it‚Äôs just called Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm going to guess that Michael ""dies"" in the end of the movie, but somehow the movie hints that He's still alive."

ek1ePFp-nBI,he's not dangerous

ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be way better than the passed Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shouldn't have watched that right before trying to sleep but looks like a good movie üòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,anyone else notice the part when he¬†bumps into the kid with the radio like he did in part 2.. 1:57¬† the kid is even wearing a cowboy hat just like the young guy in part 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who thinks eventually Laurie will go crazy and become the next Michael Myers? I do!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Make a movie with Michael Myers, Freddy, Leatherface, Jason, throw in the Queen from Alien and the dreadlocked thing from Predator and have then duke it out in battle royal complete with all kinds of weapons n shit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"BEST PART... NO ""ROB ZOMBIE"" IN THE CREDITS!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one?? Wow. I've enjoyed every single one but after 40 yrs or so this mfkr just won't die! Die already Michael!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Does this sequel take in consideration the 8 movies of the original Halloween film series ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know where I will be the day this comes out üòÜüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes, the trailer is finally here, and the Boogeyman is back! Michael Myers is BACK!
...
On a more serious note, I loved the trailer and I'm so exited to see Jamie and Nick reprising their roles as Laurie and Michael in this new installment of the series, makes me wish Donald would also return to reprise his role as Loomis, God the nostalgia is real! 

But, as much as I loved this trailer, it did leave me with a couple of questions regarding the timeline of the films. I'm guessing this film is set in a brand new timeline, separate from ""The Return of Michael Myers (1988)"" and ""H20 (1998)"" timelines, and only following the events of the original ""Halloween (1978)"" and ""Halloween II (1981)."" 

Laurie died pretty early in ""The Return of Michael Myers"" timeline, causing Michael to awaken from his coma in the first place, that and also the fact he learned about Jamie's existence, speaking of Jamie, she also died, at the beginning of ""The Curse of Michael Myers (1995),"" so there's no possible way this film belongs in that timeline if Laurie is still alive and she has a daughter, who's not Jamie. The ""H20"" timeline is also out of the question, since Laurie died at the beginning of ""Resurrection (2002)"" and she had a son, John, who's not a girl. 

Now that I'm analyzing all of this pretty carefully, I'm realizing that it's pretty evident this film is set in a separate timeline from the other two, so I pretty much just stated the obvious... but you know what? I don't care, I love analyzing timelines anyway, this was fun for me. I am kinda disappointed we will never get to expand on the Cult of Thorn and the curse within Michael himself, they were such fascinating concepts in my opinion and it's a shame they were only touched on in one film and teased in the previous one to that one, but that doesn't change the fact that Michael Myers is finally back to Haddonfield for more screams and blood, and we're gonna see Laurie act like a total badass! 

I only ask for one thing in this film: please give us what should've been the conclusion to the original ""Halloween"" franchise in ""Halloween II"" and the ""H20"" timeline, Laurie finally taking down her bloodthirsty, psychotic brother once and for all, avenging all the innocent lives he has taken, including those closest and dearest to Laurie herself, that's a truly satisfying conclusion in my opinion."
ek1ePFp-nBI,ITS TRASH
ek1ePFp-nBI,He'll stop killing once they put that damned piano away.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH JAMIE LEE CURTIS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"then it goes on halloween, perfect.."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Lets gooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuvk this looks soo scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,The escape from a mental institution is getting old. I realize its hard to say what happened to him after the original but come on. For starters laurie who is so determined to kill him would never visit him? Surely she would have been told he was captured and locked up. Ruined Leatherface the same way. It would be refreshing to accept that humans are evil and leave it at that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,man im seeing this right away
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anyone think there could be a connection between the anticipated games after June 14 and this movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Release Halloween movies around Halloween.... Adds to the feel....

ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad ass!! This better bring another Fridaythe13th now !! üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Like if this movie abouta be lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Even throw I kinda knew rob was not going to do another Halloween movie. I‚Äôve been waiting on this for a while now so don‚Äôt disappoint everyone plz.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie should‚Äôve helped them make this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why didnt they just show the ending as well considering they just showed the entire rest of the movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,she is old but still gold i love jamie lee curtis for ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will he come out in Mortal kombat 11?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm ready for this. If it was me I would of added a few from the original movie like Tommy and Lindsey the original sheriff brackett etc but this shit looks damn good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,About dang time Michael came out of that stinkin closet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel bad for the little kids
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought That Bitch Died WTF
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully a sequel that was worth making
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cringe
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:57 The fuck is this, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another aweful remake probably
ek1ePFp-nBI,MY PAPI RETURNS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didmy Laurie die tho in ressurection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,One thing I liked about Michael is how much more of a normal killer he is. No powers like Jason in the later movies or Freddie. He‚Äôs can be killed like anyone else. (Except for the fact he seems to be able to soak up bullets like a sponge in many cases)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a good horror slasher film
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus F. Christ! This trailer is as dumb as a bag of Trump's. This looks awful.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't Laurie Strode like die in Halloween Resurrection already? ;P
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck Halloween its Weenie hut juniors all day!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Welp, this one is too scary for me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,We need JOHN WICK to kill the boogeyman..
ek1ePFp-nBI,I gotta see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't know if we should be stoked this is coming in October or bummed this isn't coming out until October...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This actually looks really good- I do wish it wasn't just called 'Halloween' though. I mean, Its a retcon continuation, just acknowledge that to avoid confusion, sheesh. Halloween:REBIRTH. Or maybe not. One way they could explain the sequels or allude to them is they could be a dream of Lori Strode's. Like she could mention she once had a satisfying dream about decapitating Michael or something."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"McBride and green paid a lot attention to detail. They say they're taking away the supernatural aspect. Going as far as giving him a messed up eye in the poster artwork. Which all sequels seemed to forget about. But explain this, if they're continuing from the first movie, how does a mortal human being lift up another man to the ceiling, with one arm at full extension, which happened in the first movie? Whether you have increased strength due to being psychotic, not even a champion bodybuilder could do that. 

Hopefully McBride and green are lying to us. We know michael as supernatural. He is the boogeyman. Michael must be supernatural. That's what made him scary. Being that force that you couldn't get away from. You can shoot him, stab him, burn him, but he will find you. This is Michael. This is what the embodiment of evil does. Always one step behind you."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jaimie lee is back so you know it‚Äôs gonna be a great movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:49 if you pause at the right moment you can see his whole head
ek1ePFp-nBI,please
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can everyone forgive me? I am never trying to invoke anger. It's just this damn god complex keeps getting in my way! I kid! I love all of you.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I ain't gonna lie this movie look trash smh it seems so different from the others
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well your gonna die might as well finish your shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was it me? Or did I hear shots being fired at rob zombies Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,Add my snap üî•üî•üî• // kciity106  üëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,why would these dumb motherfuckers show him the mask and trigger that shit! well they both deserved to die
ek1ePFp-nBI,My dad show me the post of Halloween on Facebook and he told me he seen the original movie of Halloween and I‚Äôm so excited for the remake of it
ek1ePFp-nBI,YASSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAYAYAYAYAYA
ek1ePFp-nBI,So wait that means michael myers is like 68 years old
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ayeeeee let's go there making a new one
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSS!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Nah, that was just a rumor someone made up.""

Nice bit of retconning on the part of the screenwriters. Glad this is a straightforward sequel to the original rather than having to figure out the canon of the sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So are all the other Halloween movies after the first one (not including the Rob Zombie Remakes) non-canon then?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers vs Leatherface
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can see Jamie Lee Curtis still acting in these Halloween movies even when shes 100 years old üòÜüëë
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where's Jason at????ü§îü§îü§îü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,IMAX?
ek1ePFp-nBI,my wig is flying over Beijing
ek1ePFp-nBI,An actual REAL Halloween trailer! Definitely getting a ticket!
ek1ePFp-nBI,it come out on my birthday wow!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wat dis pls explain im confoozed
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lots of good movies! Coming out! Check out some good gaming videos https://youtu.be/7Mqs6XgJNjY
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hyped hyped hyped !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Something different something new
Amazing , can't wait to watch it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks terrible. Jamie Lee Curtis must be in financial trouble.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hands Down, my all time favorite horror/suspense/thriller series!  I do, however, continue to miss the good Doctor Sam Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist, played by the late Donald Pleasence.  After many years of treatment, Dr Loomis became convinced that when looking into the eyes of his patient, what was looking back was ""Pure Evil!""  When you think upon that, how could it not be anyone's biggest Nightmare?!   Watch out!  ....  HE'S BEHIND YOU!!!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Alright gang! Let's see who's under the mask.*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Carpenter is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't Wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I didn't know a horror movie trailer could actually get me hype for the movie.  I mean this dude escaped and is crazy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should've called it Halloween H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,"MICHAEL IS BACK! this shit got me the chills I‚Äôm definitely seeing this 
1.5k dislikes fuck outta here with that bullshit"
ek1ePFp-nBI,When is this stupid fucking series gunna end holy shit. Horror is already easily the weakest fucking genre of stereotypical shit and people keep eating this garbage up because of stupid misplaced nostalgia.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michel Myers vs Jared from subway, honestly the best cross over"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM READY üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome price of Halloween Horror Nights did not do Candyman haunted house yet and Phantasm and the burning and Ashtabula
ek1ePFp-nBI,Saw the original in the theater when I was a kid. Didn't sleep alone for a full month.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so sick of remix of the same old horror movie characters we need to bring back Candyman Phantasm and the burning and Sleepaway Camp old school 80 movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can never take that music seriouslyüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So another alternate timeline sequel to fix the series after some idiot decided to make a sequel to Halloween H20 which was the perfect ending to the franchise.

I'd say don't screw it up but after this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxwsEqiptwo there is now way it could get worse."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 Goosebumps everywhere. I can't wait!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok so is this a sequel to Halloween 2 or H20? I know for sure they are ignoring Resurrection because Laurie is alive.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahhhhh shyttttt hessss backkkkkk
ek1ePFp-nBI,The best kind of reboots are the ones that undo the terrible sequels
ek1ePFp-nBI,This all of this Halloween is much better than the last couple remix Rob Zombie sucked I'm thinking his classic I hope they don't f*** this s*** up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah! Genius!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For us hardcore fans, we have been following and waiting for this trailer for so long. I‚Äôve lost count on how many times I‚Äôve watched my Halloween collection. It‚Äôs like Halloween is honestly part of my being. I always hoped for at least one last showdown between Laurie and Michael. This movie looks so promising. I honestly can‚Äôt wait."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did she kill another incident person at 2:10?
ek1ePFp-nBI,doesn't look that great
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should‚Äôve just named it ‚ÄúHalloween H40‚Äù as to avoid confusion. It‚Äôs basically what it is anyway.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just watch original same story
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH HELL YEAH... CAN‚ÄôT WAIT FOR THIS
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:27 when you think you're closet is full but it's just Michael Myers in there
ek1ePFp-nBI,Www.spotlesswashing.com
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have waited so many years for this film. Carpenter, Castle, and Curtis are all back - and I couldn't be happier."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"idk, a little skeptical about this one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol looks dumb... they waited to long for this kinda movie... just another desperate attempt to get a quick dollar because of the name and cult like following this movie has... they ruined this movie along time ago...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this another reboot or rob zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,No version can beat Rob Zombie.  He made the best Halloween EVER.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can we get a face reveal at 1 million views please. Michael needs to show his face
ek1ePFp-nBI,nice nice NICE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"DEAR GOD I CAN SEE ""can you close the door"" MEMES BEING MADE AS WE SPEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh please God not another shitty reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they are ignoring all the sequels (not Rob Zombie related)? I thought Laurie already died in the 1st scene of Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I missed that theme song
ek1ePFp-nBI,finely a ad i can enjoy
ek1ePFp-nBI,So what movies are canon to this film
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Here's Johnny"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Favorite movie since I was a little kid. I love Halloween üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This does look promising. That last bit though with the babysitter... that didn't look much like a stab. More like a ""meh *bap to the arm* ""."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Closing a door in front of Michael is *D A N K*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dang there only basing the movie only off of Halloween 1  and 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does the mask give him supernatural powers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thick slices of Velveeta
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn Jamie L. Curtis isn't takin' any of Micheal's shit
She fuckin' ready to kill his ass
But sadly this movie doesn't seem to take after Halloween H20 nor Halloween Resurrection with Mikey Myers getting his ass whooped by a 90's rapper
But hey we can still dream since it's not even in theaters yet"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now I can't sleep. Mission accomplished trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie takes place after which movie? Rob zombies or the one in the 80s or something?
ek1ePFp-nBI,His head was cut off.... Lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can a Halloween expert help me understand the lore here. I thought Michael got his head cut off at one point. Is that in a different timeline? Does this carry on from the Rob Zombie films?
ek1ePFp-nBI,We never saw his true face (except as a child in the orginal and rob zombie films) and i hope we never do. His mask is his face as the character.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh wait? Actually a good reworked film? Is this a dream?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Girl in the stall should have had Decisive Strike. Maybe then she wouldn't have gotten mori'd.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now!! this is what I was expecting on the rob zombie Remake! but Noooooo  was a wast of film  depressing and gory, this looks good!! Looking forward for this üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:46 to 0:49 ""Hodooooor!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ok but why is it just called halloween? its not a reboot.
this is the 3rd halloween movie to just be called halloween"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit I watched this at night thinking I‚Äôm not scared of this anymore but that music ffs omg help me üò´üò≠üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks very, very good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I want a Dick up my butt now
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hmmm, he‚Äôs more than a murderer. He never dies, and never gets sentenced to death, why? Maybe he can‚Äôt die, maybe he‚Äôs something else."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's my favorite movie! incredible !
I Love it !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this takes place after the first one? Why not the second one? That movie was just as good and a solid part 2 to the first one cause at the end of the first one he escapes so you would have to awkwardly alter that ending to have this make sense I mean yeah he burns at the end of the 2nd one but you could say he ""somehow healed from the burn wounds"" and was taken away. I mean I think the only reason they didn't have it take place after the 2nd one is because that was already basically done with Halloween H2O."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is a sequel?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please continue the streak of great horror movies directed by comedic filmmakers. Get Out, A Quiet Place..........Halloween?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just hope they explain how loomis shot him so many times yet when loomis went to look down he was gone...
ek1ePFp-nBI,It sounds like they‚Äôre keeping true to the original instead of the remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,"it better have a sex scene in it, all successful horror movies have to have a sex scene, and not just any regular sex scene, im talking about a woman cowgirl riding a guy hard af with dead bodies on the floor and they're tied up with blood everywhere in an abandoned broken down house and at the end he busts a nut all over the place"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay so this movie takes place after the first movie but the second through sixth movie never happened(plus h20) please correct me if I'm wrong.
ek1ePFp-nBI,William Shatner is scarier
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last closet scene was honestly just hilarious
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Died like 3 times in this Series & Laurie once, how are they both still apart of it?... Should've went a new route."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like garbage
ek1ePFp-nBI,YessssüôåüèΩ
ek1ePFp-nBI,DAMN THAT ENDING THO
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woah wait... this actually looks good?!?! I'll probably be disappointed but I'll give it a shot.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many trailers this week? Too bad my smile ain't in any of them
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Am I the only one who liked Rob Zombie's versions, as well as John Carpenter's? In fact, I saw the Zombie's version before Carpenter's, since I was a little kid when it came out."
ek1ePFp-nBI,holy fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS SO FUCKING AWESOME YEEEEEEEEEES
ek1ePFp-nBI,Check out my vids!
ek1ePFp-nBI,im waiting!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did any of y'all see me in the back??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope Seth Rogan does a good job playing mike Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoever you are... whatever you do... Make sure your laces are tied when you run from this dude.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Michael... Come out and plaayyy!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike Myers... SHREK
ek1ePFp-nBI,For being a comedian Danny McBride and that guy did perfect with this now this is a sequel üíØfinally after all the flops a Halloween worth watching
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dame kids a Halloween movie again

ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm waiting for FoundFlix to explain the whole story and the ending because I‚Äôm to scared to see the movie ü§îüòå
ek1ePFp-nBI,The fact they got the original Laurie Strode from the 1978 version in this movie is crazy...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""It‚Äôs Halloween, everyone‚Äôs entitled to one good scare."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Better than Slender Man movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ed gein
ek1ePFp-nBI,I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!! AAAAAAH! I'M SO EXCITED!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúScary Hours‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this looks fun
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why is this being rebooted....AGAIN???  Come on hollywierd, get some originality....."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"jamie lee curtis: ‚ÄúDo you know that I prayed every night that he would escape?‚Äù 

cop: ‚ÄúWhat the hell did you do that for?‚Äù

jamie lee curtis: ‚ÄúSo I can kill him.‚Äù

jamie lee curtis is savage af"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awww shit here we go again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal still doesn‚Äôt kill kids....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kid: HEY MOM CAN YOU CHECK THE CLOSET   Mom:Sure     Michael:SUPRISE MOTHAFUCKA 2:35
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cried watching this. I‚Äôm so excited.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this isn't R I am out. It reminds me of halloween 4 where he goes to a gas station kills them and gets the cover alls. I really hope their are new ideas if not this is gonna suck and if it isn't R.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Spooky üò±üò±üò±üòÖüòÖ
ek1ePFp-nBI,NO! It looks like fucking garbage! WHY ATE THEY RUINING THIS FRANCHISE EVEN MORE THAN HALLOWEEN 4 DID?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've been waiting
ek1ePFp-nBI,how many remakes have been made?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I watch Halloween 1 & 2 (the old versions) almost every week, can't wait to see this one..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm not sleeping tonight.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Countdown to Halloween. Gonna where my mask and suit to the cinema. Ooooh
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know what I‚Äôm doing on HALLOWEEN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one who here's Jurrasic Park?
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx3Dh6MbHwk&t=189s
ek1ePFp-nBI,This didn‚Äôt need a remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,A must !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting for this trailer ty
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow I like this Movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ahhh after 9 years, we got a new sequel

ek1ePFp-nBI,The OG bogeyman!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Other inmates going crazy at the sight of Michael's mask. Chills.
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE TOOTH FAIRY :D 1:44
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Rob Zombie: ""I remaster Halloween, I did an amazing job with Michael Meyers.""

John Carpenter: ""Hold my beer"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, now that looks and feels like a Carpenter film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*Hey you!*









Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a big dream >_<
I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM* I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 31k comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!). 

*FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen. ""Markiplier's Let's Play Slender The Arrival!"" I was so excited because I LOVED Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. (Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!). 

As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos WHENEVER I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. (SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!) 

So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. TakeTheJurny, because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice. No one has to sub I just wanted everyone to have a chance to see my Youtube before it hits 1million, and that will happen one day :) thanks for reading, and as always I will see you, when I heed the call, to the next Journey, Adios guys! <3 and thanks so much for reading!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So there are now officially 3 alternate  Halloween timelines
ek1ePFp-nBI,gone back to basics wow! great
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know what I love, I love those reboots/remakes/sequels that keep the same name as the original first one. I just love searching online and finding several results that are not what I'm looking for. Ami rite?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like I‚Äôm not sleeping tonight sweeties üôÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I couldn't wait for the trailer. Im super excited when they announced a new movie I was trill. This trailer didn't let me down. Wow I hope it makes good money to show rob zombie how it's done
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Trick or Treat, Mutha' Fukka!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see it!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have to watch this
ek1ePFp-nBI,SAME GUY THAT PLAYED MYERS IN THE 1978 HALLOWEEN!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok...im on board with this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I shouldn‚Äôt watch this trailer at night alone in my house
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cringed üò©lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess there is 1.5k Jason fans
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't think people realize that this story has been reworked again. It's not a sequel to the first Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers > Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,üò®
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like how a trailer for a horror/slasher film can make it to #1 on trending but a PewDiePie video meant for ""9 year olds"" still can't even make it to #40"
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHY
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many Michael Meyer movies that you minds of well turn it into a series.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't say I'm expecting much here, but I'm open for any surprises."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,The new movie :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lebron just got swept by the warriors
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only problem(s) I have with this is how they handled Michael and Laurie. He killed 3 people. 3. And yet he's in maximum security, chained up... They don't even do that in real life to people who have killed like 10+. And Laurie is scared of him because he killed 3 people? I feel like it would make more sense if they made this a sequel to Halloween II, as he kills more people and in my opinion makes him even scarier. The fact that he killed 3 people and is hailed as some legendary murder is just... Dumb. I can't be the only one who feels this way right?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sorry what?. Jamie chopped his head off in Halloween H20. how is he back?? And she has supposedly been waiting all these years
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 on trending?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting took many years!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Weak, meh"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis. Amy Irving. Heather Langdankamp.üíû
ek1ePFp-nBI,If you know the legend why would you be babysitting tonight of all nights -A.D.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought the first half looked pretty bad, but it certainly got better after that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like it's going to be good... I have a feeling that John Carpenter did a good job on this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Note to everyone who doesn't understand what's going on - This film is a DIRECT SEQUEL to the original film. EVERY sequel after the original is being ignored. This is in an alternate timeline so Laurie is NOT Michael's sister. Pass it on.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a new movie of Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another remake? Where's the originality gentlemen?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this ignores the H20/Resurrection timeline, the cult of thorn timeline and also part 2 I want to know how they have him back at the mental hospital if at the end of part 1 he walks away after Loomis shoots him. They should have continued after part 2 like the other timelines."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I SWEAR IF MICHAEL IS FRICKIN ANTHONY HOPKINS IM GONNA JUMP OFF A BRIDGE>
ek1ePFp-nBI,I haven‚Äôt seen a Halloween movie in at least 15 years and watching this trailer feels so Nostalgic.
ek1ePFp-nBI,after 40 years they still cant get rid of micheal :)))
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh my fuck, this is going to be amazing"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""it is time for the true slasher films o return""

read it with mark hamill's voice"
ek1ePFp-nBI,finally a good freaking horror movie...gives me hannibal vibes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh this is going to be a shit movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else thinks Michael or Laurie OR BOTH are going to die in this movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else thinks Michael or Laurie OR BOTH are going to die?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ngl I was anticipating this movie more than avengers infinity wars
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer is already better than the Rob Zombie remake bullshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this a remake or a sequel. Cuz what if I‚Äôm talking to a friend about the original but they think I‚Äôm talking bout this since the title is the same
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think i need grillz like 69 to protect my teeth
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer is pulling Jurassic Park/World piano on us
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,"At first, I was kind of upset that this movie ignores H20 and 2 as I liked both of those movies.  But the reason for doing so is so that they can only add to what makes Michael Myers scarier than Freddy or Jason ever had time to be - how LITTLE we know about him.  The less we know about him, the more terrifying he is.  Michael and Laurie aren't even brother and sister anymore.  And I kind of like that - because their reason for doing so is exactly what I've been saying;  It gave Michael a clear motive and made him less scary.  Without it, he's back to being the unpredictable escaped lunatic from Halloween.

So all you're left with is a normal happy little boy who one Halloween night, picked up a knife, gutted his own sister, and desired only to keep killing.  And that is absolutely terrifying."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know if he kills everyone.

They'll be no need for an asteroid attack....üòê"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I can‚Äôt wait for this üò´ It‚Äôs gonna be so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Me:‚Äùhey,I‚Äôm going to close my closet door
Friend:‚Äùok
Me:*tries to close but doesn‚Äôt close multiple times* 
Me:*opens door*
Me:*sees Michael with a clever*‚Äùumm hey Michael could you do me a favor,I‚Äôm trying to close my closet door,could you like scoot back a tad bit? If so,thanks,you can kill me later.‚Äù"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"if your supporting this movie, feel free to lend your voice and reason vs mine"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In all the Halloween movies, why do they make this guy seem invincible? Also why cant we ever see his face?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if William shatner gets royalties for all these movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:59 that kid must be brave to bump into micheal myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,As long as rob zombie isn't anywhere near this film I'm sure it will be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Helllllll yeaaa!
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://discord.gg/tuK4zJX
ek1ePFp-nBI,Number 1 ay?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Have the right-wingers showed up yet to scream about how the movie is ""SJW propaganda"" because Laurie is now a badass granny?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was fine with my everyday life. Now I'm scared again!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will someone please let this franchise rest please!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched a lot of movies this year but this is the most hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is creepy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Surprised this is on trending above makeup tutorials and jimmy kimmel
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought John Carpenter was directing this now I read it‚Äôs David Green. And if it‚Äôs supposed to be a sequel to the 1st one why are they saying Michael is Laurie‚Äôs brother. Also she should have had a son & a daughter
ek1ePFp-nBI,Spooky.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg hype
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like garbage its not good as the other ones  it‚Äôs TRASH (MY OPINION)
ek1ePFp-nBI,So now they are three movies named Halloween and three Halloween 2 movies...Wow...I'm so confused!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Vi·ªát nam üáªüá≥üáªüá≥
ek1ePFp-nBI,BRING IT!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing! Getting a real nostalgia feeling from this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like the hype from DBD paid off.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck Rob Zombie's trash... This is a real Halloween movie. The first one we have had since Halloween 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Michael dies I‚Äôll cry
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"And I love old horror movies. So it's nothing personal.....

Here's a pitch off the top of my head:

A skeleton that roams the earth searching for water, eating all the turnips it discovers. Bam! Johnny Depp as the skeleton, and Bryan Cranston as the last turnip farmer on the planet. They become friends,  fall in love, and skeleton Depp turns into Julienne Moore. 

The end."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesss üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That closet scene, lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this comment gets to 1k Micheal Myers will be in my closet tonight
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is the week of movie trailers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know what, I think I'll just leave my closet alone from now on."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do you believe in the Boogeyman?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaaas! love Halloween can't wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Put this movie to rest already.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôre throwing all the sequels in the trash....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good shit üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,The guy that directed this directed pineapple express. I wonder will red make an appearance üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,i wont be going out on halloween anymore
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy shit, this may actually be....good?

I'm not getting my hopes up, because I know how silly that is but this trailer makes me think they may do Halloween justice."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let me guess...even this picture, which looks promising, will have the PC bullshit and the little black kid at the end of the trailer will escape after his babysitter buys the farm, and because there just HAS to be a black hero in every movie anymore, he will escape the house and in some way assist Jamie Lee in killing Mikey. Better not turn out that way, dammit. Leave the racial PC garbage to Star Wars...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhhhh shiiiiit
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!! YES!!!!!!! YEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,H3LL YEAH!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Leather face wins flawless victory Fatality
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah. Can't wait! üî™üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is like my 20th time watching this trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve never gotten such a wholesome feeling from a horror movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This could spin off to so many other great movies. Say Michael dies for good in this movie but somehow he has a son that carries on his fathers work and he would be the face of the new Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok no matter how shitty this will probably be, that closet scene was creative and different and I love it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's like a choose your own adventure film. Either follow the rabbit hole using the other films, or watch the new one and follow this story instead. It appeases more people."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope this tries to keep some of the restraint original and doesn't go full boobs, terrible characters and over the too Gore like Rob Zombie did."
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHAT?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,In real life it horrible
ek1ePFp-nBI,AHHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,ugh god I loved it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's a halloween 2 remake üòÄ, hopefully redeems its self from rob zombie shit remake that took 35 days to film"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So LS/JLC didn't die at the end of Halloween Resurection?? #cantwait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ah come on, things like this devalue the original work, please stop! 
Its called culture mining and it needs to stop.
Also why no negative comments ?
I think someones purging the comment section."
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCKING HELL
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I cannot believe it's been 20 years since H20, WOW! This is the last chapter for Halloween, so I hope we go out with a bang."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait I love Halloween movies!!! Shut up and take my money!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM SO HAPPY IT'S RETURNING
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis better not die!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who plays fortnite ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS THE SEQUEL OF THE ORIGINAL!!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Boogy man
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oooh...a badass old lady, that's new"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally looks like the franchise is getting the reboot it deserves.  And I'm happy that this movie doesn't come out until October; I think it's kind of a waste when horror movie are released in January.  Anyway, this one had me at the score.  John Carpenter is all I'm saying."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really captured the classic spooky ness of MM.  kinda wonderful.  Hopefully the rest really delivers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Crazy thing is this has been a movie franchise for like 50 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back boi!!! üî™

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Another one?!?!
Thos was one of my favs growing up but they beat these movies into the groundüòü"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last 40 years he has been in that asylum? So should we ignore all the spinoffs and sequels like Halloween 2000 as if they never happened?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1 no.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:04
Okay, good.

Because I thought this was one of them Unofficial Trailers in disguise."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hollywood in a nutshell...

Originality = 0%"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought laurie died in Halloween Resurrection???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hold up is that his mom?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy shit, Hollywood really has run out of ideas"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so freaken hyped about this. This is gonna be bad ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please tell me a black guy karate kicks Michael at the end and says ‚ÄúTrick or Treat  modafucka.‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,hes back and hes come home to kill
ek1ePFp-nBI,No joke I actual screamed when I first saw the thumb nail of the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well that was completely different from what I was expecting
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got a call to audition since it is here in Houuston being filmed
ek1ePFp-nBI,lol trying to close the closet *2:36*
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM READY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus Christ, another one??? If it‚Äôs not broken, don‚Äôt fucking fix it or give it an extra piece!!!!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm just here to see the people cry about the zombie reboot. Oh and because Michael Myers is the best..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm so excited to see the original boogeyman is back! Just hope they don't make him mortal!! That would take all of the scare out of the him! The boogeyman never dies, he just waits!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt close your doors...*because my toe is in the way*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 45 or Halloween 3 ? Not knocking it looks cool just kinda confused
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS LOOKS AWESOMEE
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is why you shoud check the closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is the old lady the original girl from the first movie?
Edit: Thanks for the answers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is it Halloween yet ! ! !

ek1ePFp-nBI,BADASSüëøüëøüëø
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like it's going to be good. I'm excited to say the least.
ek1ePFp-nBI,another one?  again?  geez
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im sorry but if a man like Michael Myers was imprisoned he would be executed on the spot even if the state doesnt have death penalty. They wouldn't be transferring someone like that on an unguarded school bus... I'd rather have him come back via supernatural means then something as retarded as that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The closet scene alone validated it as better than the Rob Zombie nonsense.  It's like cinematic hindsight cringe with those. That was so simplistic and disappointing. People still cheerleading that shit too lol. Don't realize they got duped.  He has an on the nose, marketable stage name and all his films shit. How can a guy that's truly a fan of horror films completely forego any semblance of suspense in lieu of extra blood and profanity and sexual assault. He traded it for cheap and obvious shock value. If I change my name to Jerry Dracula will someone please give me a budget and licensing to have a go at it? He was the limp bizkit of film making."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It does actually look like its going to be a descent addition, but...only one problem, That is Halloween Resurrection, he killed his sister on the roof top remember?? Soooo, unless she also learned how to trick and fake death, then..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*Micheal banging on bathroom stall*

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait to see ""The Shape"" in action again."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So 60 year old MICHAEL is suppose to be scary and a threat????? lol....no thanks. I will watch ZOMBIES 2007 REMAKE which was AWESOME and actually realistic.
ek1ePFp-nBI,We need John wick for this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH JESUS CRIST NOT ANOTHER ONE!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg omg omg omg I‚Äôm so excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After the awful rob zombie versions, this movie needs to be a masterpiece."
ek1ePFp-nBI,all classic horror fans lets party
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm pretty sure Micheal doesn't have a degree in dentistry...
ek1ePFp-nBI,That theme music  gave me goosebumps
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Dead By Daylight will buff Laurie perks and so do Michael =)) xD . I can't wait to see this <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks trash tbh
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg cant wait :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like the hobo version of Michael Myers

ek1ePFp-nBI,https://youtu.be/FAAspAcJy6o
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well there goes trick or treating.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The genius thing about the closet scare is that, when she opens it the final time, he's so far in the back that it takes just a split second longer than you would expect to see him, and it's while you're having that split nanosecond of confusion/relief that your focus shifts from expecting to see Michael to wondering where he is, which is enough of a subliminal fake-out to make the obvious reveal genuinely startling."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait! :3
ek1ePFp-nBI,i dont understand anything cuz i hvnt seeen any of the movies lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,For the love of GOD stop making these fucking movies!!  Enough is enough!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have never, NEVER been so excited for a movie!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am excited yet disappointed they decided to include some of the same scares we have already had in pervious movies. And completely avoiding Halloween 2 is a mistake, esp since jaime lee was in the 2nd movie. They could have made this work as a true halloween 3"
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 in Trending!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks great wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, John wasn't exactly ""The Boogeyman"". He was the one you sent to kill the fuckin' Boogeyman."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder what Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) did in this timeline after the first one. Was he still trying to get a response from Michael Myers even after he was taken into custody? ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not the best idea to watch this before bed, especially when I hate horror movies, besides the first Halloween"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's good to have you home, Michael & Laurie!!! ;-)"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Well looks like James has to do the kill count now
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay now we're talking. So many duds in horror now were back to basics. Finally!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"1978 in 2018 = one word, YES!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,so now everything after the 1st movie is non canon...will we ever find out what happened to Michael and Jamies baby...lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let‚Äôs go can‚Äôt wait for Halloween üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should've gotten a mask from Silver Shamrock.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just saved me lil money with this trailer!!!!!!!hate trailers just pictured the hole movie in my head!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm to scared to go close my closet door
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes! Jamie Lee Curtis is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh SHIT!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh nononono I‚Äôm not watching this 

I all most shat my pants when I saw the trailer what will happen if I saw the movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeaahhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,I didn‚Äôt know the guy playing Michael was the original from the 1st movie. Awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Remember the bathroom stall in H2O? Only this time he kills someone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,No one cared who I was until I put on the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,Couldn't close the damn door cause of his fat ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,I saw a version of this trailer in a survey before basically the same
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michaels Back, Fuck yeah! Finally, there will be a good horror movie during my generation."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Parents better watch their children this Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why did I hear the Jurassic Park theme in this trailer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Granny ain‚Äôt joking! She ready for his death!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In the past 15 years, out of allll the remakes Hollywood has made, there are literally only 2 that i thought were very good: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 and Rob Zombie's Halloween 2007. Those were great because there was so much time, thought, and effort put into them. And the acting was great, especially in TCM. 
It was all downhill from there."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So looking forward to this hype!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How to spoil a movie.

Show every myers clip"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Produced by weedhead writer directors, this Michael
Is relaxed and real. Follow him as he eats tacos, pays
The light bill and tots yoga.

Blumfeld can't afford a 
Make up artist."

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like an actually good horror movie sequal
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trick or teeth
ek1ePFp-nBI,Got dame sold me already
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this has nothing to do with Rob zombie but back to the original????
ek1ePFp-nBI,If it‚Äôs by Blum House Productions it‚Äôs gonna be great!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who takes a shit with their pants on
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am down. ""I shot him  x amount of times!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,K isnt he like super old now ?üò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,tbh my fave part of these movies was that it was the most hardcore sibling rivalry of all time. I'll be dissappointed if they truly aren't related at all in this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So if he‚Äôs not going after his sister, why did he go after Laurie Strode? The way he stalked her when he got to Haddonfield at school than walking home, this is just stupid if they erase the sibling storyline! And they‚Äôre completely erasing Loomis which is a shame too! Yes I know the actor is dead but I guarantee you he will hardly be mentioned at all in this movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so hard right now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"im so hype, fuckkkkkkk"
ek1ePFp-nBI,this just made my day 10000x times better :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers came back from the dead after 10 years and slashing his way to the big screen. Get ready for a whole lot of nightmares. #halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs boogy time everyone!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Kill it with a bomb or fire or call the armyü§£üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Justin bieber should be in this so we can see him quartered up!
ek1ePFp-nBI,....this looks....DOPE AS HELL! AND ITS A SEQUAL FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE MATERIAL?!! AWESOME!‚Äô
ek1ePFp-nBI,Crazy that Danny McBride co-wrote this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Beautiful checkered flooring in the asylum.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nice,yeahhh,love that mask"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Putting Jamie Lee Curtis in this is *_NOT_* going to make it good
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last scene gave me chills üôåüèΩ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, I'm confused. I thought Laurie died when Michael went to kill her in a mental institute. Unless it was non canon."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Awww, yeeeaah!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He back finally it about time bc all the horror movies are weak and lame but this movie is more better then all the horror movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad time to be named michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great. Yet another reason for me to be scared of closets!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssss my fave horror movie slasher is back!!!! üôèüèæüôåüèæ Its been too long. üò© This looks so good. üòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,No remake of Halloween will ever beat *Rob Zombie's Halloween*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Best case scenario this turns out to be he best follow up to the original film.

Worst case scenario it ends up like Texas Chainsaw 3D where it boasts to being the true direct sequel of the original film and turns out to be shit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yassssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Long haired Jamie lee Curtis? Oh yeah a def. watch.
ek1ePFp-nBI,cant wait to download it on piratebay!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank God none of those people carried guns! Fuck guns. They kill people

ek1ePFp-nBI,Lowkey Michael Probably Gives Great Root Canals For a low Price
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times can they rehash this crap.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer is good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michaels come home.....again, and again ,and again,and again,and again,and again,and again,and again,and again, and FINALLY....... Again!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,its brilliant to make laurie now Hunting Michael.

ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite horror movie comes out a day after my birthday
ek1ePFp-nBI,And they ran out of ideas!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why tf am I laughing at the last scene
ek1ePFp-nBI,So that‚Äôs isn‚Äôt Michael? That‚Äôs the dude that was treating Michael as a child right?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is Jamie lee Curtis really that old ? Or did they make her look older
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, so I‚Äôve never watched Horror movies a lot like this but oddly , this looks so well constructed and scripted that I have to see it!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As I watch the trailer over and over ( iloved it, pretty hyped by the movie that will come out on october) one question remains for me, they said the ending of the original was retconned for this 2018 sequel, I'm wondering what they changed there? Is it after dr.loomis fired 6 shots at micheal after falling from the house that the neighboor took notice thinking that those gunshot sounds were a little too loud and real for a halloween night? That they rushed outside and noticed a man laying on the ground and called the police immediately (maybe calling chief bracket) and went on to the scene and captured micheal?????

Really that's the one thing i wanna know, I hope the movie explained whether it well atleast on a exposition or slight flashback on how they retcon it......pretty excited for october 19!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this guy were real you would see the army shooting him down like no future.
ek1ePFp-nBI,so she cutted her head....and...heres more shit...stupid ass fans....stupid movie industry
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSS JAMIE!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I need this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm dying to watch this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's arthritis probably killing himself.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks wack
ek1ePFp-nBI,Never was invested in Halloween but this looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 probably her boyfriend playing a prank who she bangs later that evening
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is there a reason why my closet won't close.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stoked
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please, please, please be as good as the first one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Them damn closet doors...
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YES! FINALLY!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn
ek1ePFp-nBI,"holy shit, when i try closing my closet door at night and it doesnt close , imma jump ma window"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,If he was in captivity for 40 years how old he he now that he is out ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seems like a bad sign when they feel the need to put a trailer for the trailer at the start of the trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To all of you who are confused, (1) no, this is NOT a remake/reboot. It‚Äôs a direct sequel to the first 1978 film, so it‚Äôs ignoring all the other sequels after it. (2) This means NO Jamie didn‚Äôt die. She died in Halloween: Resurrection, but since all the sequels are being ignored, that didn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs a continuation of the first movie. Which also means Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is not Michael‚Äôs sister in the movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting for a decent sequel for 20 years. Thank God it‚Äôs here!
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH40dgI1kK75mEwzeaQacFQ
ek1ePFp-nBI,After they said Michael was shot I thought they were about to go nuts and say how it was six times.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes he‚Äôs yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Micheal spares those dogs
ek1ePFp-nBI,The one and only Boogeyman has returned !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The original set the horror film blueprint for the next 20 years. Interesting trivia: Carpenter composed the famous halloween theme in a complex  5/4 meter. The reason is, it's not a familiar meter to most ears and it makes people uneasy and on edge."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not better than purge...
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs 5‚Äô10 .... I just wish he was fucking taller üò≠üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is there a teaser trailer right before the trailer? Why is this becoming a thing now??

ek1ePFp-nBI,The Boogeymen NEVER DIES
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For the fans left a little duped, this movie is a retcon, it ignores anything after the first one, a direct sequel. And yes Nick Castle does return as the iconic killer, but not in the way some would hope. Like a number of movies, the actual actor that's wearing the mask and jumpsuit is a stuntman. Nick is just the face of the killer so to speak."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks goood but scary üëª

ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Won‚Äôt lie, the Rob Zombie one was üî•üíØ so idk"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can't vouch for the film as I haven't seen it, but it looks very polished. Either way I'm excited to see Jamie Lee come back like Rambo."
ek1ePFp-nBI,*HOLY SHIT! I PEED MY PANTS*
ek1ePFp-nBI,So glad this didn't come out when I was a kid. That closet scene would have kept me up all night just staring at the closet door.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogiemans back!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Halloween franchise has managed to have a creepy vibe. Looking forward to this one. Plus it‚Äôs directed by Danny McBride and produced by John Carpenter. Sounds like it‚Äôs good hands.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Clay face üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this gave me the chills can‚Äôt wait to c it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if it‚Äôs gonna be like H20 just more serious with the confrontation. Cat and mouse like. With the roles switching between Michael and Laurie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can see it now. All the edgy fucks complaining that the original Halloween was the best & this is lame.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween: H40?

ek1ePFp-nBI,help me get my song to 200k please üôè
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOL at the end Michael getting the door shut on his face like 'wtf woman stop bloody hitting me with the door ffs you're dead'
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh man this looks promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are they ever going to stop making these movies? Like seriously how many movies can you make with the basically same plot?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"THE OLD TIME GREAT IS BACK ..FUCK YEAHH  HOPEFULY  MICHEAL FINALLY KILLS THE SISTER .. thinking out loud ,,, it would be awesome if they both die üî™üî™üî™"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait for this, looks very promising. 
And Curtis makes it an instant plus üòÜ"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombies versions are way better.  And Jaime Lee Curtis is looking haggerd
ek1ePFp-nBI,But Laurie died in Halloween resurrection??? That don't make sense
ek1ePFp-nBI,At first I thought I was listening to some Jurassic world theme..but movie looks promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,so excited for this film! No more Rob Zombie! #MikeyMike
ek1ePFp-nBI,MIKE IS BACK BABY!
ek1ePFp-nBI,ssounds lame but i hope it turns out better then it looks

ek1ePFp-nBI,The closet scene tho üò©üò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dear Mr and Ms Strode. You have been going at this for about 40 years. 
Have you considered therapy?

ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear that no theme song is more blood curdling than this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just so everyone knows, this movie ignores all other movies and spin offs... It takes place 40 years after the very first classic movie/plot.

So glad J.L. Curtis is back! :D"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man Mike Myers sure looks different from his Austin Powers days.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween H40: 40 Years Later
ek1ePFp-nBI,So he's like 60 years old? LOL k Grandpa Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,They ignored all sequels..... Thats brilliant....not!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is my favorite out of all the slashers. This trailer looks good. That last jump scare got me. But in terms of sequels ... they should‚Äôve just rebooted the series and made a good film. I know while I‚Äôm watching this he‚Äôs gonna be doing some physical stuff that he just shouldn‚Äôt be able to being as a 60+ year old man üë¥üèº lol but I like it
ek1ePFp-nBI,i don‚Äôt like being in the dark because i feel like he‚Äôs going to come out of nowhere and kill me .. üò≠üòÇ

ek1ePFp-nBI,üëäüòÖüëçüôàüôâüôä
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer gives me an 80's horror film vibe no stupid jump scares looks really good hope they don't show anymore trailers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,She is getting into a face off with the most dangerous man on the planet and drags out her antique weapons collection. Dumb.
ek1ePFp-nBI,That would be cool if they made Michael vs Jason

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Mehhh a kid with an AK-47 is scarier. Like I'm suppose to be scared of some guy in a mask with a knife. Maybe if he was wearing body armor and had a shotgun I would be shitting bricks like Brendan Fletcher as Bill Williamson in Rampage. 

I wish they did Pinhead in a proper Hellraiser movie. Now that guy freaked me out when I was younger."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they threw out all of the sequel and stuck with the original

ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only thing i dont understand is how is Jaime still alive ? I thought she died in Halloween resurrection.  She got stabbed , kiss Michael's mask and said see u in hell then she fell off the building"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Lit suace
ek1ePFp-nBI,What movie does this one take place after? Is it the 2nd or 3rd Halloween movie? Or what?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is awfully spry for his age. (Suspicion)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Knowing john carpenter, Green and mcbribe had something to do with this film it yells amazing! I'm proud of all the work they do with their films! It shows they can work with anything that comes their way! Blockbuster hit come October"
ek1ePFp-nBI,ive never been so erect
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the Halloween that I wanna see. Awesome trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Didn't laurie strode die in halloween resurrection? how do they explain that away?   if they ignore that movie, then how do they explain the ending to h20? how is michael myers still alive?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Upgrade is my favorite Blumhouse movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love the mask!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If Laurie and Michael aren't siblings anymore, then what the HELL is the motivation for Michael to want her dead in the first place?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will Joe Grizzly make a return?

ek1ePFp-nBI,YaaaaaaAaAaaaaaaaaaaas
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she chopped husband head off
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers Vs Mike Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are we going to forget that his head was chopped off?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are the excluding Rob Zombies versions all together? Because he already escaped the insane asylum.
ek1ePFp-nBI,When I first watched the trailer I thought those teeth were candy corn üò®
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are we forgetting all the Halloween‚Äôs after the first one didn‚Äôt happen. Or busta rhymes didn‚Äôt put a beat down on him?
ek1ePFp-nBI,give it a fucking rest
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,What a great week of trailers! So many movies to watch!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg yessss I‚Äôm crying!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm only like 10 and this looks awesome I‚Äôm into lots of scary stuff
ek1ePFp-nBI,How is Jamie lee still alive????? NEVER MIND SMH
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:40 Is that an old man wearing panties? I wonder how they're going to explain that scene in the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,i believe theres 2 michael miers movies coming out by different producers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,A perfectly aged original style William Shatner mask and the original soundtrack = John Carpenter influence. Damn I can't wait for this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They gave away too much in the trailer.. should‚Äôve simplified it.. we all know the lore, and legend of Michael Myers. 

But! I‚Äôm hyped.. 


The last good Halloween movie was Rob Zombies version; which I feel is a cult classic."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can you close the closet door?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome üëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah, you waited for him 2 movies ago and look how that turned out, now that I mentioned it... How are you still here..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i got erection watching this 
is it normal ??üòì"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"DJ KHALID: ""Another one?"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,The place where their was the checkerboard floor looked like my school
ek1ePFp-nBI,AHHHHHHHHHHH THAT CLOSET SCENE üí•
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why he wanna kill his relatives so bad??
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG IM SO SHOOK
ek1ePFp-nBI,"But when the doctor shot him, he fell out the window and disappeared .. he never incarcerated him.. that part doesn‚Äôt make sense"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Actually looks scary!! Im excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn shes old
ek1ePFp-nBI,hopefully the movie is better than the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ROB ZOMBIE DID IT BETTER, YET MORE GORLY ... BUT BETTER DANG IT"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I already see a few problems with this movie, but I'm willing to give it a chance. Firstly, the director has had no experience with horror in his life, and his last film made only half of its budget back. I can see influences from John Carpenter sprinkled throughout the trailer, but the fact of the matter is that they show too much of Michael too soon. What made him scary was that you could never get a clear look, and there was always a sense of suspense generated by the fact that he was everywhere, almost playing a scary game of peekaboo with his victims. The costume design is on point, I will give the crew that. But I am already very concerned, given that the trailer relies on showing Michael Myers in focus rather than out of focus and relies on cheap gross-out and horror gags (like Michael in the closet). Still hoping, and still going to go and watch it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,i thought Hollywood was against vilolence???
ek1ePFp-nBI,"meh, liked rob zombies version better...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks so stupid, like he would be an old dude by now.  Ridiculous. Why keep continuing the same old movie? The ones who are saying this looks good are probably 10 year olds."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This totally gonna be scary üíØüíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Welp, looks like my ass got plans for Halloween nightüòÇüòÇüòéüíØüíØ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If people are confused about the canons:

Halloween (1978) & Halloween 2 (2018)- Michael and Lorie are NOT established to be brother and sister and Lorie's children Jamie from Halloween 4,5,6 and John from Halloween 7 (Jamie didn't exist in 7) do not exist in this movie canon.  


Halloween 1, Halloween 2 and H20 are canon to each other. - Michael and Lorie ARE established to be long-lost brother and sister. In h20, John is Lorie's only child, Jamie doesn't exist in this canon. 

Halloween 1,2,4,5,6 are canon to each other.- in this canon, Jamie is Lorie's only child and Steven her only grandchild. John doesn''t exist in this canon because Lorie died in a car crash off-screen. 

Hope this helps with any confusion :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,ima be fucken scared now if i see anyone in a micheal myers costume this halloween hell nah . üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome video üíñüíì
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Who else suddenly started giggling in excitement when the originals soundtrack started playing?




... I might have pulled something"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why isn't he wearing the hockey mask, like the old films? Rob Zombie needs to stick to his garbage music career. What a waste of a remake."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one??? Fuck Hollywood Jews are not even trying.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude it‚Äôs so popular they made a holiday after it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now i totally understand about this conversation!

BatS : the f**k is this mask?
J.D :   Austin powers!

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is awesome my grandpas gonna love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks better than a Star Is Born.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This could end up being the best in the series....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does this also go with the original movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I never new this would happen
ek1ePFp-nBI,U had me until the dumb closet scene
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell no
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can‚Äôt really be sure but from this trailer he looks like he‚Äôs an average sized man mate 6‚Äô3, isn‚Äôt the supposed to be a hulk of a man like 6‚Äô8 or something. I don‚Äôt know about the rest of you but to me he doesn‚Äôt really look intimidating unless he is huge it gives you the feeling like you can‚Äôt fight back unless you have a gun."
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòâ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another attempt to ruin the original classic film.....SAD
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm always so hyped for horror movies especially this one but I‚Äôm always the one that squints their eyes on certain scenes ü§ï
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Isn't this franchise kinda redundant by now. scary yes, but redundant."
ek1ePFp-nBI,When's it coming out?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The new scream queen looks awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like more of a comedy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else looked over at their closet door at the end?üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,okay what timeline is this one in cause it looks like its gonna be ignoring the thing that michael and Laurie are brother and sister and does this take place after the original halloween or halloween 2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm so hoping this movie is just as good as the original. Especially since John Carpenter himself is involved. Is there anyone who can tell me where this film sits in the Halloween continuity? I know it's a sequel to the original, but does Halloween 2 no exist anymore? Is this going to be like what they did with Halloween H20? A sequel that negates the others (Halloween 4/5/6)? Anyone have any ideas?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My body is ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,This girl really just slammed the door in ma boi Michael's face.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Cant wait!!  PLUS, I hope this does well so a new FRIDAY film can get a go ahead!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So are we supposed to ignore Rob Zombie's Halloween? Also what about the other sequels I thought Laurie Strode was dead? And so Halloween resurrection is just excluded huh? This trailer looks very interesting can't wait to see it I just was kind of confused at first.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ysy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can not wait for this!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,...*claps* WHEN IS HELLOWEEN ILL TELL YOU SOMETHING ITS FUCKIN SUMMER SO WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A TRAILER FOR A HALLOWEEN MOVIE IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKIN SUMMER

ek1ePFp-nBI,"(Christ Teaches on Repentance):

I tell you, Nay:
but, except ye repent,
ye shall all likewise perish.
(Luke 13:3).

I tell you, Nay:
but, except ye repent,
ye shall all likewise perish.
(Luke 13:5).

***(Unless you repent): Jesus point here is that everyone stands at the edge of death until repentance occurs. The death in view here is spiritual, not physical).
***(The manner in which a person dies is not a measure of righteousness; what is important is not to die outside of God's grace and care. The way to avoid such a fate is to repent, to come to God through the care of the physician Jesus. (John 5:32)<--I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance).
***(Repent/Repentance): The Hebrew word translated repent means, ‚ÄúTurn Back‚Äù or ‚ÄúTurn around‚Äù. The word refers to a reversal or change of direction. The Prophets commonly used this word to call Israelites to a radically conscious rejection of their past Sin. When used as a theological term, repentance implies not only sorrow but a complete turnaround: To change one‚Äôs mind about Sin, receive God‚Äôs provision of Salvation, and return whole heartedly to him).

He spake also this parable;
A certain man had a fig tree 
planted in his vineyard; 
and he came and sought fruit thereon, 
and found none.

***(A fig tree): Often represents God's blessing, or a people who have a special relationship with God. The man in this parable represents God; the fig tree represents Israel).
Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard,

Behold,

these three years I come seeking fruit 
on this fig tree, 
and find none: 
cut it down; 
why does it use up the ground?

And he answering said unto him,

Lord, 
let it alone this year also, 
till I shall dig around it, 
and fertilize it:

And if it bear fruit, 
well:
but if not,

then after that 
thou shalt cut it down.

***(But if not): If the tree, symbolizing Israel, would yield some fruit it could escape judgment; a failure to be fruitful would result in judgment).

(Luke 13:6-9).

***(John 15:5-10)<---(Jesus)<---I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: (continue ye in my love). If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

***(Matthew 3:10<---(Jesus)<---And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

***(Matthew 7:19)<---(Jesus)<---Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

***(Matthew 3:8)<---(Jesus)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

***(Before I really turned to the Lord, I used to have dreams, I was about to swim in Lava like a volcano. But praise the Lord, he did not make me feel it. Thank you Jesus  :)...."

ek1ePFp-nBI,No I don't believe in the boogeyman...be us John Wick is the one you send to kill the fucking boogeyman
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess there might be a twist. Michael isn't alone and someone is helping him.

ek1ePFp-nBI,That pretty fucking cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,*It‚Äôs the grandma from Ratatouille*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I look at the Halloween movies as having an multi verse of three separate storylines of the way things could've happened. But this by far looks like the best storyline.

ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogeyman. Nothing more scary in our psyche while walking into a shadow at night.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HUGE Michael Myers fan! I rewatch all the movies every Halloween....except season of the witch lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so excited! I hope its not a slasher like the Rob Zombie ones tho.
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äô s come back home. It‚Äôs going to be a GOOD ONE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great seeing Jamie Lee Curtis üëç

ek1ePFp-nBI,Ima watch this movie on Halloween night
ek1ePFp-nBI,"She cut off the man's head, I mean what else is there to do?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike is Back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I remember when Jamie Lee Curtis was Uber hot in the 80's aerobics era... One must never forget these things.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is a direct sequel to the original film and ignores all sequels? He‚Äôs not her brother now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm worried because blumhouse is apart of it, and they tend to fuck movies up"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Bruh he killed 4 people not 3
The blonde 
The blondes boyfriend 
The curly haired chick
The mechanic stupid film makers I‚Äôm disappointed as it is an they lay this shit"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1st in trending
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween: H20-18
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis = BAD ASS!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie took this film 2 a whole other level. They should've let Rob Zombie finished making the remaining Holloween  franchises.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should have released this last year in October 13th
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 I screamed when I seen him BRO IDK WHY my family looked at me crazy until I told themüòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,i thought she died in one sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks great, with some tribute scenes to Halloween 1, 2, 4 y 7."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have watched the trailer about 5 times now
ek1ePFp-nBI,basically gave the whole movie away
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal sneaking around and killing bitches like he got Sneak 100 and Melee Weapons 100
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh yec we got some gay obama shit hell no mikey. Obama stop ur shit mr mikey gon bitch ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòãü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,üóøüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can anyone tell me how he's in custody after that night considering his body just disappeared by the end?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hate public restrooms
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again? Sheesh Hollywood you're creatively AND morally bankrupt.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The one thing that Zombie's take on Michael that he ultimately failed at was the mysteriousness and darkly omnipresent feeling that Michael had in the original. He was Michael Myers to Loomis, but to everyone else, he was ""The Shape."" The embodiement of evil. I think this movie will be really good in that respect. Everything else? We'll just have to wait and see."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone please tell me if I have to watch any other movie before this one to fully understand it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 2018 will become an immortal classic.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is gonna be so good. i have been waiting for a good scary movie and this and hereditary look so good. i am so fucking excited.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:02 I honestly thought he was Conor Mcgregor xD
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,I super love Michael Myers for the one simple fact that he never killed anyone under 17. This gave me the opportunity to watch a super scary movie with my kids and them still resting assured that Michael was not under thier bed because they were too young for him to kill.
ek1ePFp-nBI,the only boogeyman is John Wick stfu
ek1ePFp-nBI,The closet scene was gold
ek1ePFp-nBI,Genuinely so fucking excited for this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal giving Jason  a run for his money
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's up to everybody that is checking out this new Halloween Movie Trailer.  The only thing i am confused about is how in the hell they brought Michael Myers back when his sister amputated his head with the axe off the 20 years later Halloween movie. That's got me confused that's all. The Rob Zombie Halloween he did of Michael Myers he was on steroids because he was real big compared to the one off this movie trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Idk why but I low key want a murderer around where I live to get the anxiety and fear of knowing that someone like that is in in my town. Idk I think it‚Äôs just me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes Michael üíóüíóüíóüòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve never been more excited for a horror film in my entire life! At last Michael Myers is back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"WATCH the trailer.  Now, hit repeat, close your eyes and LISTEN to the trailer. You feel it? Those hairs standing up on the back of your neck? That chill that just ran down your spine? That IS Michael Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Scary üòß
ek1ePFp-nBI,The British dude sound like gordan Ramsay
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal vs Jason ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait so now only the first halloween is cannon? Lol what is going on
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm never trusting bathroom stalls again
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YES! FINALLY NIGGA! THIS is THE HALLOWEEN that we all WANTED. And not that GARBAGE ASS ROB ZOMBIE VERSION SHIT NIGGA. :P 

HALLOWEEN is back to its ORIGINAL ROOT. REAL TALK NIGGA"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, such a great atmosphere setting! Cant wait !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF is up with the 5 second teaser of the teaser before all the latest teasers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,here is the music from game Dead by Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like I‚Äôve been waiting FOREVER for this movie!!! It looks so good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 Trending...People are in desperate need of horror.
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg omg this is going to be great!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequel to the original Halloween series?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Proof necromancy is real. They brought Jamie Lee Curtis back from the dead.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Trick or Tre-Nope*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anyone hear Jurassic parks piano song haha
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope that this movie will actually be good. A classic horror movie for the new generation.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween best time of year, and this movie has just made it better"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Idk but 2018 started out okay and going great with avengers and the summer movies and now it‚Äôs gunna end amazing with venom and Halloween ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èüíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"ok, may have to start re-watching horror movies if they're bring this type of standard back..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel so weird cuz yesterday i was talking about Michael Myers and one day later (Today) there is a trailer.Did i predict it and not know or is it just a coincedence ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Only thing that confuses me is that didn't they kill her off in Halloween Resurrection? When she tried to take his mask off and he stabbed her in the back and threw her off that roof? I hope this continues from the sequal or this will make no sense at all.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm glad she isn't dead lol, I mean I know she already died but they doing this film from a different viewpoint which could be interesting. I can't wait"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Closet door had you thinking 'surely not?'
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait üëåüëåüëåüî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie looks promising. I hope it's ""shit-your-pants"" worthy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Y‚Äôall be running out of ideas for new movies üòÇüòÇüòÇ y‚Äôall did jeepers creepers like 4x , This like 67x & Chucky like 900x"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"If we are going by the timeline of the original movie, Michael Myers would be 61 years old. He's a terrifying mall walker now."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaaaaas best movie Jamie my Queen
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fk yeah!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It would not be a Halloween movie without Jamie Lee Curtis üòÄüéÉüëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welp ive seen the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It‚Äôs not the 80‚Äôs anymore.  Can‚Äôt  have a monster run after babysitters, helpless kids and teens.. old..... I loved the originals.. first one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,When he was in the closet that scared the shit out of me-
ek1ePFp-nBI,He wasn't arrested he was lit up in flames in the second movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"a Halloween movie, made by Blumhouse? count me in!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"FUCKIN YESSS, original director original actor... BRING IT"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking finally that they had the trailer come out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pause at 1:49
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mf dropped teeth over the door. I'm done üíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this is like the Halloween version of ""Superman Returns""?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn mike went platinum and the day aint over with lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, Michael Myers that does not look like a fucking midget... or one that has been on a diet."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"so WE GOT A üé• NAMED AFTER A HOLIDAY WHATS NEXT? ""CHRISTMAS?"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've seen Jason and the rest, but Michael is the best!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,why do modern trailers always have a mini trailer at the beginning that ruins the surprise?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Brother and Sister fight for the death....or till one of them breaks a hip
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 Oof
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, my heart is racing and I love it!!! Can‚Äôt wait!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I was worried until I saw Jamie Lee Curtis. I'll miss Donald Pleasence, but this looks good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally! One that doesnt look like crap lol. I'm excited for this one!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Interesting...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait!! Childhood fan of Halloween üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this halloween 2 remake?
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should have brought Rob Zombie back his movies are better.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally. Something to look forward to. üòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so fuckin happy they made a good trailer! I hope it‚Äôs a good movie. Looks much more original and suspenseful like the old movies. Can‚Äôt wait!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stop remaking movies you shitheads
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is such a cutie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hype
ek1ePFp-nBI,Has anyone seen the new Legit Food Review?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nick Castle, who portrayed Michael Myers in the original Halloween, returns to the role for this movie. He was always the best by far...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,A true classic never goes out of style!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Again
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like they showed the whole fucking movie ü§®
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's hope that they don't butcher this movie too... It looks very promising so far.
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF is the point of this? Give me the original Halloween 2 anyday not this arrogant reboot nonsense. Looks SO amateur. Welcome to the modern era- we dont have to create anything NEW just constantly mine past properties and trash them for a new generation zzzzzzzzzzzz
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last part ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Meyers is coming home and IM HERE FOR IT.üíÄüíÄüëèüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruce willis @1:20
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve waited so long
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this supposed direct sequel to ""Halloween"" is called ""Halloween""....fucking idiots..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry I will always prefer the original and this day and age with all the PC/SJW bullshit infecting films I don't have any hope for this to be good no matter how decent the trailer looks. Movies suck now just full of left wing trash. On top of which I am sick of sequels no one asked for remakes, reboots, prequels etc. Hollyweird has run its course."
ek1ePFp-nBI,#TeamMichael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please let this be good..... But what I don't understand is the 40yrs in captivity. What happened to the other films after part 2? Are we just not doing that?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how they have Laurie Strode as like the Dr.loomis in this movie ü§îüò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,Uhhh hell nah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this turns out good , I'll consider it as Halloween 2. At least for me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,he be lookin thicc
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a potentially good Halloween film. It might help me mentally erase the crap Rob Zombie put out before this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am 5 subs away from 150 plz help
ek1ePFp-nBI,CAN'T ‚Ä¢ FUCKING ‚Ä¢ WAIT !!!! üòçüòúüòú
ek1ePFp-nBI,"SKIPS.. Weak as Fuck.. Nothing original hollywood, thats a damn shame.. just remake after remake after box office flop.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love Halloween and Michael Myers and after watching this trailer, I think it‚Äôs best I keep my fond memories and allow the new generation of fans to enjoy this movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you want a real surprise watch Halloween 3 "" season of the witch "" . Whoooooooo"
ek1ePFp-nBI,God damn it! Is this a sequel to Curse of Michael Myers and Halloween Resurrection ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be as good as halloween H2O.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Omg Finally That LGBTQ Pride BS Isn't #1 On Tending Anymore üòíüòí*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Testing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why does the music sound like the Jurassic park theme around 1:00?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hopefully they make references to the other slashers in this film since Freddy, Jason, Leatherface, Chucky, & Pinhead exist in the same universe as Michael"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Meanwhile in America...
ek1ePFp-nBI,the end where Michael was in the closet was funny.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:43 When I first found out about the Tooth Fairy
ek1ePFp-nBI,My body is ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòçüòçüòòüòòüòªüòª‚ù§‚ù§üíôüíôüíìüíìüíïüíïüíñüíñüíóüíóüíòüíòüíùüíùüíûüíûüíüüíü‚úå‚úåüëäüëämichael

ek1ePFp-nBI,Soooo... The question is... Do you keep the door open or try to close it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot wait omggg I am a huge huge Halloween fan. I‚Äôve seen every single one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still waiting for a crossover with Jason and Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am definitely gonna see this movie it just looks so promising and I really hope these types of movies can make a comeback starting with this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,There is only 1 movie that can top this a new Friday the 13 movie

ek1ePFp-nBI,"At about 50 seconds when the calm part started and the piano started playing .. I legit thought it was going to be the Jurassic Park theme. Its ridiculously close for some reason. I asked some friends, and they thought the same. Wtf?"

ek1ePFp-nBI,I am loving that sexy new mask. Really old and dingy looking. I like that shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just when you thought it was safe to go trick or treating again... Michael Myers Returns on Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"didnt even watch the trailer but by the looks of comments sounds like it was good.... That being said i will watch this when it comes out, so that i may face i childhood fear...As a lil girl i always hate when a michael Myers movie was on, because i would watch just a little of it and Boom have nightmares of him chasing me and other for days. now i could watch all the other Freddy, Jason, jeepers creepers. just not this guy. now with that being said i could just watch the old ones to face my fears but i feel really bored watching them and always find my self distracted through the whole movie. Anyway wish me luck guys."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shet
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Michael Myers music is the BEST
ek1ePFp-nBI,Booooooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yes !

ek1ePFp-nBI,"i forget the amount of times i've watched this now, oh please be good, this looks promising but please be good please!."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last scene is why I can‚Äôt fuck with closet doors being half open at night when I‚Äôm trying to sleep üíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANNOT WAIT !! üôèüèΩüò©
ek1ePFp-nBI,UMMM IM SCARED
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Does this take place after the Halloween 2 reboot or the originals? If originals, which one? Please reply."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't he die for good in Halloween H2O? JLC cut off his head with an axe.
ek1ePFp-nBI,the classic's are coming back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait for this Michel coming home to hadenfield Illinois
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This Looks Perrrrfect! We got our original Michael Myers Back, Mr.Castle Himself. I hope they included the Mr.Sandman song in this as well üòÄüòÄ. Bye Bye Mr.Zombie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Give It up already , by now shit Is played out YAWNING"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like Halloween 2 better than Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Here‚Äôs to it not sucking
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wack
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this another Rob Zombie one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope other franchises also ignore all their lame sequels spin offs and reboots too as Star Wars, Transformers, Child's Play, DC Universe, Paranormal Activity, etc etc etc"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks so good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,My boy is back in town üòè
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The court yard scene is so incredible, unsettling and so well done. I had my phone on me at work and as soon as the notification went off to let me know that the youtube trailer was ready this morning,  I pretended that I had diarrhea, so I sat in the staff bathroom for 10min with the lights out and watched this fuckn trailer over and over again. Then I couldn't concentrate on my work as I couldn't get that courtyard scene out of my head. I work at a daycare by the way..I'm not even joking"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus Christ watching the trailer without any sound makes it seem like any old serial killer horror movie XD
ek1ePFp-nBI,They need to make a move with Jason versus Michael Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesss! Michael is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,I came a little
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers may never rich his goal of being the last of his family, I did want to know what happens to the last one remaining. Likely nothing its not a supernatural horror, but I like him more than Freddy and Jason because its not, and what is he after remains that reason why he is in this genre. Plus he is insane."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:13 That classic Halloween theme
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Absolutely despise remakes, but if you're going to do it, do it well hopefully it's good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm back bictch

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm still going to see it, but if I‚Äôm being honest this trailer doesn‚Äôt really impress me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I CANT WAIT ,THANK GOD, A REAL HORROR FILM"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When Mike kills somebody he just doesn't kill them. He punishes them in the process. He'll punch you in the face, stab you in the neck then rip your arm off. And beat you to death with said arm."
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know it‚Äôs gonna be good with John Carpenter as the Executive Producer!
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite character of all time! Michael is back. October cant come any faster!ü§óü§ó
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don‚Äôt think Hollywood can even kill mike. Damn.
ek1ePFp-nBI,When me and my sister show love for each other

ek1ePFp-nBI,If that was real me:Oh HELL NO:MICHEAL:OH HELL YAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing!!! Simply Amazing!!! Super Retro Throwback Approved!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm tired of seeing a trailer before a trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ever since the 80s and 90s ended, there hasn't been a true horror icon anymore"
ek1ePFp-nBI,11:60     https://youtu.be/Exv7iamLU44
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYY
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the most iconic and legendary killers! I cannot wait to watch this! My fav horror movie franchise of all time!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ehhhh... we‚Äôll see. Some parts look corny.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I need to watch thisüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Have mercy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"haha got you

*Read* *more*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well great
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope little kids don't ruin this like they did with IT
ek1ePFp-nBI,I already know this is gonna be great
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope this is good because Michael is my favorite horror character
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let me guess the release date...oh wait that's right
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If somehow ur reading this, I know u don't know me but, if u know u have 3 - 5 free minutes, please go to my new page and give just ONE of my songs a chance. Im not an artist that is capable of mass producing songs so i rely soley on putting time and thought into the music i write but due to this i hesitate putting out my music because their views havent reached my desired goals yet. So please just listen to one song and if u like it leave a comment, let me know where u heard of me, theres more coming soon and even if ur just there to spread hate I can't even stress how much that would mean to me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anybody else jumped at the end ? Lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I initially wondered why the new 'Suspiria' remake wasn't going to be released until early November, rather than some time in October.
Then, I watched this trailer, and it all made sense.
As amazing as 'Suspiria' was and as promising as its remake looks, there's no way in Hell it would have been able to compete in the box office with this in October."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn...I'm feeling this! Can't wait for this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:18 bruh deadass sounds like the bolt action sniper
ek1ePFp-nBI,"One movie better than all the scary movie franchises - check
Scarier than A Quiet Place - Check
Annabelle franchises looks like a kiddie cartoon now..... - *check* ‚úì‚úì‚úì"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt fukn wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OG Myers is back :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just more proof there are no more original ideas in Hollywood. I wonder that movies would come out if there was rule that said you can‚Äôt reboot or have a sequel to anything made before 2018.
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many reboots can one horror movie receive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,ahhhhh I'm soo excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:57-2:08 ayyy they stole that music from COD zombies
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is michaels deal? Is he cursed like Jason? Is he not human anymore like Freddy? Or is he a normal dude with a knack for knives
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait another 133 days... it looks awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I believe the series goes by the first one, the second one, and then the fourth one. Everything else doesn't count (And Season of the witch stands on it's own and it's my favourite)
This one will do nicely to fit in <3"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The bathroom scene isn't Michael. If you pause itjust right at 1:48. you can see the guys face(20's-30's yrs old) which is all bloody and has a full head of hair. Michael is partially bald in the asylum scene. I'm guessing just another escaped loonie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Spectacular üëåüî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,yooooo if finally here Halloween let's gooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Another generic remake, that relies on jump scares. When will they learn..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You don't even release the movie on October 31st? You know, Halloween? What the movie is named after?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Offensive portrayals of mental health: The movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,anything's good with jamie lee curtis.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal is home again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hes way to agressive
ek1ePFp-nBI,She want to kill her own brother i would understand if he was mass murderer insane but that is messed up in all wayü§îü§îü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,00:00-00:50 looks like a much more interesting film. But it is just a trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so there!! I'm wondering though how they'll fit Lauries death in Halloween H20 into story line.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*MY NIGGA IS BACK FROM THE DEAD* üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,The mask is on point!! just like the original!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers... he have return !
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so ready.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Strangers prey at night is better JK
ek1ePFp-nBI,That reaction was so late
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did they just show the entire plot of the movie in 2:44?  Saved me $12.00.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"FUCKING love Halloween, da na na da na na da na da na!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally Mike is back üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who's gonna watch it? üòà‚ùó
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm rooting for Michael Myers... HE'S TOO BAD ASS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1) they chopped off his freaking head! 
2) YES YES OH GOD YES !!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,BRROOO I CANT WAIIIT

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I cant believe im about to say this. This movie, looks fucking amazing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who‚Äôs going trick or treat
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtf is this gay shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is Halloween 2 cannon for this one or just the original?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hooooooly shiiiit yeah

ek1ePFp-nBI,yeeeah maaaan
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so good! They've been putting out some trash scary movies but holy shit this gets me excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So like, they‚Äôre just retconning from when Michael killed Laurie?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy crap!!! Talk about detail!!! Anyone else notice you can see the hole left in the neck of the mask from the knitting needle from the original when Michael turns his head toward the end of the trailer???
ek1ePFp-nBI,This doesn't look scary at all honestly. But its probably cus i dont find serial killer movies scary.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, Jamie is looking OLD!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"it's 2018, why is michael myers still a guy"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last scare is lazy and predictable
ek1ePFp-nBI,Unpopular opinion: I'm more excited for Venom than this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why can‚Äôt we move forward and stop remaking every mildly successful movie of the past 3 decades? Seriously, it‚Äôs like Hollywood is afraid of doing ANYTHING different and ruining every movie I loved as a kid."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought michael's sister died already? Not that I give a Damn just wondering. Like the trailer regardless üëç üëç....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Meh....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Tried wayyy to hard, also see the rehashing or ""call backs"" to the kid running into Michael and the ghost under the sheet. Idk man, idk"
ek1ePFp-nBI,how jaime lees looks so old and michael looks younger.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How the pho is the guy still alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait..didn't Laurie Strode get killed?? And what happened to Michael in the last one, I forgot. (Not rob zombie Halloween BTW)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The OG will be 40 years old in October!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn what a fucking trailer

ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 on trending bitches!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoa okay.  That ending to that trailer.  It made me jump and I never get fooled by those jump scares.  This LOOKS GOOD!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wonder if they will reboot Friday the 13th after this awesome one
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter...Debra Hill...Blumhouse‚û°Halloween...this movie is going to be successful.
ek1ePFp-nBI,And that's why girls use the bathroom in packs
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Laurie has some pallets ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mr. Myers doesn't show any mercy
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm super excited for this movie. The trailer looks awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So 3 movies that are called Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,There is a reason I only poop at home. This trailer just showed why

ek1ePFp-nBI,they couldn't have came up with a more original title
ek1ePFp-nBI,#halloween2018 #cantwait #BOO #michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Usually all blumhouse movies are shit so I have low expectations
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't like the idea of Laurie preparing for Michael. I think Laurie being oblivious to what's coming for her is more suspenseful and scary. But I hope I'm wrong.

High hopes!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dang grandma can use guns
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, but this looks so stupid imo."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this new?!?!?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs baaaaaaaack
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason Voorhees would kill Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do they keep calling sequels the name of the original?
ek1ePFp-nBI,JAMIE LEE CURTIS YESS BITCH
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is funny haha
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As much as i love the Halloween movies it's kind of just the same rinse and repeat of Micheal killing some people, ""dying"",escaping, trying to kill Jamie, killing everyone else."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH MY GOD!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!!! Michael Myers is back! Its a classic People!! Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Omg! A real horror movie in 2018, thought those were extinct..... DILLY DILLY!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt believe he is the voice of Shrek! üòú
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god!!!!!! this actually scared me
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee curtis looks like she wants ALL the smoke with Michael Myers...this looks like a MUST SEE!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,ABOUT FUCKING TIME MAN
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YEEEEEEES!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,No cap tho when I was younger I used to think Michael Myers was real üò≠üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Victim runs, mike walks...still catches victim"
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the things that makes me so excited is that his Mask looks right!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can someone explain this to me..how is she alive in this? Is this a reboot? Are they continuing from the last movie when he was a kid now he's grown up?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't Wait!!! I wish Danielle Harris was her daughter in this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus, how much longer are they gonna beat this dead horse?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why are all the new horror movies about someone else beating the killer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,You know the trailer is going to look dumb when the first five seconds show the whole thing and then the title
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes i have ben waiting years
ek1ePFp-nBI,"God this shit scared the fuck out of me as a kid.
If anyone in my house said ""h20"" I'd shit maself."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this is a success, then that would mean they could remake/reboot Other series like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and other movies and it all could lead to potential crossovers like Freddy vs Jason but better. I am so excited"
ek1ePFp-nBI,When is this coming out?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes. Yes yes yes. This is what we should've been given SO many years ago.
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAS ITS BACK BABY!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this movieüòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,The first gave me nightmares for weeks!!!! I can‚Äôt wait for this!!!üòÜüòÜüòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet a AR 15 would be more effective for home defense than a lever action rifle. Just saying....
ek1ePFp-nBI,The sequel to Halloween is called Halloween?.. It should be called something like Next Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's get to 1 billion views people
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSZ MIKEY!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok please. Just please let this movie go off with a bang, and bring back what we know as HALLOWEEN."
ek1ePFp-nBI,What‚Äôs this movie about
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:16 lol they censored ‚Äúkill‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I always wonder what they think when they release trailers. Like, ""I swear if this isn't perceived well."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well done, well done..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2016 = Harley Quinn/joker 

2017 = it 




2018 = Michael Myers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,i'm wet
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking aweosme I shop in that gas station and how they turned park Circle North Charleston South Carolina Haddonfield Illinois I've always loved the movies and it was filmed in my neighborhood!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh HELL yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,We need mike Myers playing Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES OH MY GOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Um... Micheal Myers isn't supernatural like Freddy or Jason. And if this is a sequel to the original Halloween, that would make Micheal Myers in his goddamn 60s. Kind of hard to be scared of old man with a cane!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit they literally showed the whole movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just love hearing the iconic music overandoverandoverandoverandover
ek1ePFp-nBI,"LAURIE!!! I have followed her since her character was a high school girl, now she is a grandmother. Any HALLOWEEN movie without her or DR.LOOMIS (RIP) in it is not legit!!! I am excited about this movie üòÅüí®üëÅ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The movie seems really cool and the fact that the same guy who played Michael in the original is coming back seems legit but , I think the trailer really lost a bit of my interest in the movie and could've used a bit more suspense and not some foreshadowing  7/10"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,He sees you when your sleeping he knows when your awake
ek1ePFp-nBI,Meh just Hollywood trying to milk more mileage out of an IP. The whole thing was nice and wrapped up after the original Halloween 2 but the studios wanted more money. This is just another money grab done by rewriting the ending of the original two movies much like 4-6 was just a money grab using the halloween name.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really truly hope they keep his physcology. To me that made him so much more than a simple slasher.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They Need To Stop With These Sequals,Enough Is Enough."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I liked Halloween 2 when she's in the hospital
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes I can't wait!! Epic classic!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myersü§Ø

ek1ePFp-nBI,how is laurie alive
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is all great! Now all we need is Busta Rhymes.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween: This time there's a Bad-ass Grandma.

ek1ePFp-nBI,That theme song alone gave me chills .  But damn I was hoping for a true sequel . One that would replace that hott mess aka Halloween: Resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stalker is coming ^^
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:37 LOOK FAKE AF,THEY SHOULD REALLY DELETE DAT SCENE A.S.A.Pü§î"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many first movies are we getting?
ek1ePFp-nBI,thanks for showing the whole movie in the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH HELL YES!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,DAMN RIGHT THIS IS ONE ON TRENDING
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should be jason but lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"looking very VERY forward to it!!  I like the pitch.  Though I do enjoy the older sequels, this being a direct sequel to the original is a fun idea.  No more of that Michael is Laurie ' s brother junk, which I have always felt handicapped the sequels.  And John Carpenter is involved...yay!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I fuckin cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"omg he killed her while she was soiling , savage Michael is back"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seen every single Halloween movie even the crappy remakes but this looks amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This it gonna be the best one yet but October üò£
ek1ePFp-nBI,The best remake to Halloween will always be in my mind the Rob Zombie one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What the hell is this?  Is it a sequel to the first? Is Michael Myers mortal? He's fueled by revenge? Confusing as fuck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit...a REAL sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now see this is a really horror movie. Dont give me that bullshit millennium teen horror crap or that over the top gore horror movie saw sequels. The classics never go outta style.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best Serial Killer ever back in the CITY BOYS finally my boy back üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally after a decade he's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite horror movie is back Friday the 13th

ek1ePFp-nBI,I think I just accidentally shit my pants
ek1ePFp-nBI,Female Bruce Lee
ek1ePFp-nBI,The HYPE TRAIN has officially left the station! I‚Äôve been waiting forever for another great Halloween movie. I know some people probably thought it an odd choice to have Danny McBride and co work on this but I always felt that they would take this serious and show why Myers is the true Horror Icon.
ek1ePFp-nBI,La se√±ora es la polla duraa!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still waiting for Freddy Kreuger üòå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""the bus had an accident.  Michael escaped"".  Well, there's the old convenient horror film explanation.......maniac guy is being transported and.....voila......the transportation vehicle conveniently breaks down (in every single horror movie ever!) allowing the bad guy to escape."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,ive waited on this trailer!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Litttt
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet door thing made me jump. Glad to see my favorite horror movie character is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I kept pausing the video and it looked like at 1:49 when I paused it, it looked like Michael had his escape mask on like from the 2009 movie when Michael escaped In that movie he had his pumpkin escape mask. That‚Äôs what I saw at 1:49 when Michael bashed his face on the stall."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So does this mean that Halloween 2 isn't canon?
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOL I just watched the old version
ek1ePFp-nBI,Won‚Äôt top Rob Zombie‚Äôs.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess it runs in the family that they both die and come back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why? WHY?!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why did it take her that long to look inside the closetüòÇüòÇ. LIKE DAMNNNü§£ü§£
ek1ePFp-nBI,2 words .... he‚Äôs backkkkkkküòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is'nt there already two movies named Halloween and did'nt Jamie already killed Michael BEFORE being killed by him ? I get the whole reboot shit but this is kinda going too far.
You cannot be a fan of Halloween and be okay with that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to go see my nightmare
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoopty doo how many times are they going to try and reboot this piece of shit franchise?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob  zombie Halloween was epic and little myers was really deranged but love the fact that Jamie Lee is in this movie 40 yrs later and if it's as insane as Rob zombies Halloween this Halloween movie will kill all the halloween franchises even Rob zombies .
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Mind listening to my music?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Time to show up at the theater in full Micheal Myers gear
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He is fucking back baby, time for a marathon!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMFG üò≠üò≠üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Michael would be like 60yrs old in this? In the first movie he was Atleast 20 and they say he's been in captivity for 40 years. Not sure an elderly man is scary haha coming from a huge fan of all the Halloween movies. Zzx
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im confused so he has only killed 3 people after the first movie so did the rest after halloween 1 not happen
ek1ePFp-nBI,Number 1 on trending oh yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!!!!!!!!!!! üëçüî•üëå‚ù§üíìüíïüíóüíõüíôüíúüíùüíûüíú‚ù§üëÖüí¶
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm loving this but I still think Rob zombie version, is the best Michael Myers was A beast in that movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Omfg, already a million views... There's something really exciting about this this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I forgot his whole name but I don't know why in my mind I kept saying Mike Epps. Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great trailer! Fingers crossed they didn't put all the best scares in it. Can't wait to see this one!

ek1ePFp-nBI,yes please
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank you for the üòé üìΩ.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck yeah, love the rob zombie ones too"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes Michael is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i enjoy this. it looks good. i think they ran out of ideas for the other story line, which was pretty good. it started getting weird with the thorn stuff. i'm going to speculate that michael is actually killed in this new one ending this story line and then beginning something else, because this IS it for jamie lee curtis. having said that, she could die and go on from this. idk. what is everyone eles's thoughts? i know resurrection sucked and basically gave us nothing. so basically resurrection was it. rob zombies get worse with time in my opinion. i'm just throwing out thoughts now. lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEEESSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM READY
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's the type of person to not show his face in any movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer looks like a bad remake but I‚Äôm still gonna watch it because it because Michael Myers is my spirit horror killer.also why not just move away from haddonfield?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhh man. Looking good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Filmy friday

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This might end up being 2018's highest-grossing horror, like It in 2017!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This does actually look pretty good. I love the original '70's/'80's movies but this definitely does not look like some shitty remake.

ek1ePFp-nBI,he better not fucking die in this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pause at 1:55 and see the boogyman ain't fucking around
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like Freddy Krueger better.

ek1ePFp-nBI,A no mames y yo q queria q el cine retomara a las leyendas como el como jeison como fredy y como esos antiguos hermano  q eran como asesinos deformes
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just realized that the girl at the beginning of the trailer who was conducting the interview with the guy is the girl who is in the bathroom scene later in the trailer.

5. Watch new Halloween with friends"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Esse filme vai t√° irado, quem concorda deixa o like"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!! Michael Myers is back baby!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't freaking wait for the movie i can die happy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great job naming these films guys!
ek1ePFp-nBI,An overrated horror movie tbh
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer is amazing I‚Äôm definitely going to watch this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't need it .... i dont need it ...... I FUCKIN NEED IT
ek1ePFp-nBI,"my gosh i been waiting 7 years for this.....yes! Yes! yes!!!!! Michael is back!!! He waited for her, she waited for him.....and I waited for this damn movie!!!üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good trailer. But I still dont understand why companies put a 5 sec mini trailer before the actual trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Part of this movie was actually filmed down the road from where I live in Charleston, South Carolina. They had a codename for it called 'Uncle Orange'."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YEEEEEEEEEEESS!!! FINALLY! I‚ÄôM READY FOR THIS MOVIE! Also, I think they are still going to keep the ‚Äúthey‚Äòre both siblings‚Äù thing in this so Michael actually might have a motivation for killing Laurie. Also, will we get to see Myers‚Äô face after 40 years? Sure, throughout the multiple sequels we‚Äôve gotten to see Michael‚Äôs face from time to time, but I think it would be nice to have a full scene with Michael without his mask. But if not we can just Google the actor playing Mr. Myers in the film. And I like on how the trailer shows the mask as being a little worn out but not as worn out as the original one from the 1978 movie (if you look it up on Google {original Halloween mask worn out} , it looks like trash)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,k.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm still calling it ""Halloween Returns"" to differentiate it from the og and the 2007 remake."
ek1ePFp-nBI,ooooooooooooonly boring remakes and reworks in cinema nowadays. isnt there anybody who can come up with a awesome new idea? we already have Rob Zombie's Halloween movies (and they are great)...we don't need another version...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, my favourite horror movie! The old theme music gave me the chills. And that old school 70s gunshot lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,how was he locked up for 40 years? after all the sequels that came out
ek1ePFp-nBI,She had such a slow reaction at 2:35 XD

ek1ePFp-nBI,What a week of exciting trailers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Calling it now. The guy that showed mask is related. And tried to help Michael get revenge by freeing. Though Michael will still kill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bathroom scene reminds me of when MM steals someone's car!

ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how they are ignoring the sequels and going from original to this one.  It's like flash point!
ek1ePFp-nBI,There's a whole generation who has no fuckin idea how scary this shit used to be
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers wouldn't last a day on the southside of Chicago
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Michael is human than how does he survive shots
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is the rating
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The great thing is when making this movie they said Halloween‚Äôs 2-6 never happened which I‚Äôm happy about. H20, 2, and 4 I did enjoy tho"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This possibly could be a makeup movie for the Michael Myers Movie from 2017 (or 2018, I forgot)....most people weren't into it, due to the ""*big changes*"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter...I'm in.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Meu Deus ele est√° de volta. N√£o vejo a hora de assistir.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The old lady trying to kill Michel... kills the vibe of this movie trailer.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I live right next to that gas station
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is he so badass ‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,"All you need to do to get away from him is Decisive strike, Sprint-burst and to juke him around pallets that you drop infront of him."

ek1ePFp-nBI,who plays dead by daylight and is more hyped than other people for this movie? I AM :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why didn‚Äôt they just put him to death in the first place?

ek1ePFp-nBI,the 2020s are about the be the new slasher decade
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am screaming! I can't wait! Passing out from excitement
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, the trailer does look good, yes. But... if this is set in the original continuity, wouldn't Michael be pretty old by now?
He's not supernatural like Jason or Freddy. Is he going to hobble after his victims and beat them with his cane? Maybe stare at them until they turn down the music or get off the lawn?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,when the music started I shivered
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this one acts as the only true sequel to the first film? Not even the events of Halloween 2 (the original sequel) took place.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve never been more erect in my life
ek1ePFp-nBI,he's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back but don't be too sure. It could be a bad movie

ek1ePFp-nBI,So 1 and 2 are the only ones that  exist? So from 3  To the rob zombie remixing are a different universe altogether? Why would you destroy so many good movies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks really good, Jamie Lee Curtis is freaking awesome! Im glad they stuck with the original main character, otherwise the movie would be shit. Cant wait for Halloween this year, any costume ideas?"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Thats a low blow towards Rob Zombie with that brother joke I get it John you didn't like his version of your film but it's still a cheap shot
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtf ever.... Hollywood is running out of ideas lol. #greed
ek1ePFp-nBI,*MAKE. SOMETHING. ORIGINAL.*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bro I'm freaking tf out I can't wait I'm a 2001s baby but I'm glad there bringing oldies back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"well, i'm a HUGE Halloween nerd. im glad that this one continues off of the 1st movie timeline. Laurie was never Michaels sister in the first movie. The fact that he continues after her all this time with no real reason is part of what makes him scary. There is not much backround or explanation for his behaviour/intelligence and theres not supposed to be. He represents pure evil, and how somethings have no rhyme or reason and sometimes evil just...is."
ek1ePFp-nBI,it is  after rob zombie movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I woke up from a 3 year coma when i heard a nurse saying that Michael is coming back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This gon be better than the last jedi
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please don‚Äôt fuck this up, and finally no more paranormal type shitty horror movies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm still waiting for the crossover with Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,So hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be good but if not then this will go down in oofstory. (Combination of oof and history.)
ek1ePFp-nBI,??? Why do they have to keep making them just let it go. Not gonna spend my money on that...üëé
ek1ePFp-nBI,I always tought jason was coming back but nvm
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie's version RULED!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love Michael Myers but the reboot was garbage hopefully this one is better
ek1ePFp-nBI,how is he alive? wasnt his head decapitated by his sister?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are u serious it back üò≥

ek1ePFp-nBI,COME THRU JAMIE LEE !!! THE QUEEN HAS RETURNED
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait a sec...ITS A SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL
ek1ePFp-nBI,Movie looks awesome I‚Äôm very excited!!! Only thing is I don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôre not including Halloween 2.  It would make more sense and wouldn‚Äôt change the story of this one at all.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why do she got a gun it's not going to kill him this man been shot, stabbed, burned, ran over, head chopped off all that lol c'mon Jamie you should know that a gun can't kill him. I can't wait to see this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet scene tho....
ek1ePFp-nBI,WISHES DO COME TRUE
ek1ePFp-nBI,Refreshing to see an interesting horror movie resurfacing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The resolve of that dude is unwavering.

Oh, and JLC can still get it!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im such a scardy cat I couldn't even finish the video
ek1ePFp-nBI,whats your favorite movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My mind is telling me no, but my body is saying hell yes!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OOHHHHHH ITS ABOUT TO GET REALLLL
ek1ePFp-nBI,this one looks wayyyyy better than that rob zombie version
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 1 Jamie lee curtis was only 20 and now she is a grandmother omg im so excited to watch this movie after all these years
ek1ePFp-nBI,I more scared of the sharpshooter granny.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes Michael is back and better than ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Last year was Pennywise, This year it's Micheal Myers/"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The franchise is back and there is nothing you can do stop it unless you are a rotten tomatoes
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:19 oh so Fortnights in the horror industry now huh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôll go in with an open mind, but as of right now H4 & H5 are still the best sequels.  The trailer is good.  I just hope that this doesn‚Äôt flop."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I knew Michael was gay
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else loves michael myers ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,ü§§
ek1ePFp-nBI,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH SSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHIIIIIIITTTTTTTT. HE'S BACK
ek1ePFp-nBI,I mean all you gotta do is make a standard pipe bomb (probably 3-5 for that extra overkill) and attach it to a knife set in the kitchen and BOMB!  Micheal is dead.  Pretty simple actually but I guess you would really have a movie then.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Git gud Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,If you've seen 1 you've seen them all.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have EXTREMELY high expectations for this movie. The Halloween series is my favorite horror movies series ever. Everyone has that 1 movie that scares that crap out of them, or at least that 1 horror movie slasher that makes them fear the dark, that scares them SHITLESS. Michael Myers was that slasher. Jamie Lee Curtis said this was going to be the scariest one to date, and I hope she's telling the truth. Those Rob Zombie remakes were absolute SHIT! Nothing better than the originals.

The trailer was meh for me until the music shows up. THAT music. The music that has scared me ever since I first watched Halloween. 1:53. I heard that in some horror movies they put hidden sounds in the soundtrack that are made to freak people out. I 100% believe they put whatever that is in the Halloween music. I panic just hearing it. I love it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:44 Michael, she was tryna take a shit, be polite and wait until shes done"
ek1ePFp-nBI,All movies do now is re-create. Lazy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone else hear the jurassic park theme, or was it just me?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It ain't better than my movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes. Bye rob zombie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This fool will be killing people in a wheelchair 20 years from now.#Can‚ÄôtstopWon‚Äôtstop üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hm
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessssssss!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,damn okay sis
ek1ePFp-nBI,That music is legendary!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"MY FAVORITE SLASHER KILLER RETURNS WITH JAMIE LEE AND JOHN CARPENTER RETURNING! I WILL BE SEEING THIS ON OPENING DAY!!! 

R.I.P Donald Pleasence!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm so confused. Is this supposed to be reboot? It can't be a sequel since Laurie Strode is dead. She was killed in Halloween Resurrection. Don't tell me this movie is going to totally dismiss all the other sequels and do something completely different. Also, let's not forget what Rob Zombie did. I adore Jamie Lee Curtis, so we'll see how this turns out, but in all honesty, it doesn't look that great. She had her showdown with him in H20, and I don't see how this tops that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,NBA Finals live stream on my channel in a hour tune inüòµ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whats next?! Friday the 13th?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait im serious I CANT WAAAIT

ek1ePFp-nBI,this is gonna be 2016 all over again accept there are no clowns everyone is gonna be wearing a michal myers mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,Random black kid..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis needs a job again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So its a remake of a remake of a movie? Im not mad about it but now there's 3 movies with the same title of ""HALLOWEEN"" that revolve around Michael Myers. Couldn't they have at least added 40 years later or something like that to make it a bit more different."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really hope its good the original is a classic
ek1ePFp-nBI,I honestly hope he finally kills her
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUUUUCCCKKKKK YEAAAAHHHHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,That music scared me so bad as a kid. It still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*Of course, the bus crashed! Cuz why wouldn't it?*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:03 THANK YOU
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Meh.The old Halloween movies were AMAZING! This trailer did not empress me.But,the Halloween song is my favorite horror song.Never gets old!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait this actually looks good?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YES!!! Been waiting sooo long for this!!! I just hope he doesnt have stupid grunts or personality like the rob zombie versions. We need that eerie silent killer, with no emotion from the original!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now we just need Friday the 13th!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can wait for this lmao they got kids another reason why too be scare of a closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the first Halloween movie and I can't wait to see this in just a few months!
ek1ePFp-nBI,All aboard the Hype Train!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Free my nigga Mike, he ain‚Äôt do shit!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Eh, once all the mental patients started going nuts at Michael‚Äôs mask it lost me. Really not interested."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:50 - 1:08 why put the jusrasic world theme song???
(Or is my hearing off?)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gay af they shouldve made it about the doctor that treated michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I guess we are just going to ignore Halloween 2002 ever happened...
ek1ePFp-nBI,this look so awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Correct me if im wrong but michael hunts down everyone in laurie bloodline right?
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie has come out like 12 times stop! Rob Zombie was the best!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The hype for this is insane !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This movie looks so awesome! I love the atmospheric and creepy soundtrack lurking in the background. I believe that this movie will be good, suspenseful, and genuinely horrifying. This is going to make an amazing fall horror movie. I predict that this horror movie will be better than the other Halloween sequels-- challenging the 1978 original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oof number 1 on trending
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers vs superman
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg another movie I was screaming I love this. I can tell its going to be awesome

ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait for Halloween!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks shitty, A24 should've gotten the green light for this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,GOOD LAWD that hoe ass trailer took apart of my soul. Scared the shit out uhh nigga.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,ah great the thing that gave me nightmares as a kid is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs the dude that can go away for 15 years without any weight training and come out smashing and lifting shit like some low-key creepy ass Winter Soldier. Hope they address the origins of his freakishly unrealistic strength
ek1ePFp-nBI,It and now this?! I‚Äôm excited for more reboots üî•üíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YEAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,"just get john wick, he's the man you call to kill the boogey man"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Mah girl Jaime Lee ready to throw some hands
ek1ePFp-nBI,They said this was filmed in south carolina
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have little to no faith in this adaptation.  It seems monumentally stupid to tempt Michael with his mask, even if it's Just for a study.""  That'd be like presenting Norman Bates with a woman in a shower and then having the audacity to be surprised when murder happens.

All I'm saying is Jamie Lee Curtis better survive this, or we're going to have problems."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 Quit trying to shut the door on me! It‚Äôs rude!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks phenomenal.  Finally a real horror movie.  I feel like this is going to be to Halloween movies what The Dark Knight was to Batman movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,And it seem scary now
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really enjoyed zombies take on Halloween...1 thing in particular was Michael being a huge, intimidating monster. Idk if I can buy people running from this scrawny little mike."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh hell fuck yeah i been trolling just for this trailer for weeks
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow!! amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok so this does look pretty good, but I think it kind of sucks that they're doing the whole ""Nope, none of the other movies happened AT ALL, just the first one"" thing..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"#1 on trending. Yeah, fucking better be trending."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"God that closet scene is hilarious, to imagine that Michael Myers is just behind the door getting smacked by this girl repeatedly brings a smile to my face"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next time my closet door doesn't close right I'm just going to jump out the window.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really towards the end  michaels sister tries to knife him knowing that she can‚Äôt kill him and he grabs her hand and probably kills her and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the ending. Trailers sure makes me feel it‚Äôs not a good movie. I give it a 3 out of 5. It‚Äôs a horror movie anyways not surprised
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael > Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahhh the prison bus crashed cliche
ek1ePFp-nBI,"HELL YEAH, YALL BETTER NOT RUIN IT"
ek1ePFp-nBI,my heart dropped in the closet scene.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the Halloween series
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:47 i bet he puts on the mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,didnt Michael Myers sister Die?
ek1ePFp-nBI,who was here before trending?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So wait in this movie is it not canon that Michael is Lori sister or are they going to say that they made it up and then they reveal the end that Michael is actually Lori sister even though we already knew that not sister brother
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,IT'S TIME TO STOP! IT'S TIME TO STOP OKAY?! NO MORE!

ek1ePFp-nBI,That restroom scene is one of my biggest fears üò≥
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welp I‚Äôm not gonna sleep tonight and on Halloween and keep a knife under my bed if I hear somebody in the closet
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this movie is successful, and there is every indication that it will be, this will usher in an era of Blumhouse remaking Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, and others, in a way that Platinum Dunes completely failed at. I don't care for remakes or sequels, unless they're done right. This trailer right here makes it look like they nailed it!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god just end this shit already. It's been nonstop trash since 1976
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 on trending!!!! I wish so much success for this movie!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like that they're ignoring all the sequels but COME ON, Michael was captured that night?!?!?
I mean it's obvious he's coming back but wouldn't it be better if he just vanished after that night and since he was shot everyone just assumed he died and the body was never found?
Wouldn't it be better that way?
It would be like everyone moved on except for Lorie and then he comes back just when she's starting to get over it.
I don't know, I just think that having him in custody is not that exciting."

All of what Michael did happened in one night, that's not as scary as Michael going after Jamie for years after Laurie is off somewhere.

ek1ePFp-nBI,gtfo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yawn. Looks like any bland crap slasher movie made post 1980s, even the trailer is weak for a movie this big. It will be better than the Rob Zombie ones, but no one can fail that bad."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Y‚Äôall gotta stop with the Halloween remakes, the original was really fucking good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great universal can ruin another movie franchise
ek1ePFp-nBI,haha justin Y. aint on this video

ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs back and better than ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,What next micheal got a son and the story continues
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1. Why make a sequel after a remake?
2. Why contradict the end of the first film?
3. Why refer to the relationship between Lori and Michael if ignoring all but the first movie seemingly?
4. Why not play up the house a bit more? It seemed like an important thing in the original."
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite horror movie is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,ha....here comes the pain!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Those kids are so screwed
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sensacional!!!
Que trailer foi esse?
Ansiosa pra assistir.Qdo a gente pensa que o cara morreu, ele volta novamente.E a ""Boo"" a personagem de James que eu pensei que tinha morrido na cena do hospital, qdo ele derruba ela l√° de cima,e novamente est√° de volta.Caraca o que ser√° que aconteceu? Chega logo outubro."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yup yup sign me up !! He's really back fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Glad they didn't give much away in the trailer ! Looks great and I really hope the killings are brutal
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I swear to Cinema if at the end of this movie they do not run his ass through a wood chipper, bury him in concrete, or full on T-800 his ass into molten steel. They just wanna die.  the jail/asylum thing simply is not working."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm still confused as to if it's a sequel to the older Halloweens or is this a remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this will be the 14th installment right?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait!!!

Bunch of hacks."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gotta see this üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,#1 ON TRENDING BABY
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks compare to the Rob Zombie to Original one  and now it converge together
ek1ePFp-nBI,That music in the background goosebumps^3
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like every other generic horror movie today. Why bother watching?
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO EXCITED!! COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!üó°üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH YESS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*MICHAEL MYERS  IS COMING*
Beat this 'A QUIET PLACE' , 'TRUTH OR DARE' & all these non classics
But....I‚Äôm pretty sure the original Halloween movie will still be better"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My gooooood
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Look who's back, back again?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,from what ive heard the director and john carpenter are ignoring all halloween sequals and are doing a sequal on halloween 2 which came out in the late 70s so this is technically halloween part 3
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a huge fan of the Halloween series but I'm not sure about this Film . This one obviously follows on from the events of the original Halloween 2 and you obviously have to forget that there were any sequels and forget that Laurie Strode died at the end of one of them.I'll probably have to watch this one at least 2 or 3 times to really get it. It does look good though.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I 100% grantee there gonna be a scene of a dumb person taking the wrong path or instead running to safety they try to hide. It‚Äôs the stupidest shit in movies. But it is also what made them great.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fuck I'm ready this trailer is fire I can tell this movie is going to be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Definitely gonna watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Basically, this is a loose remake of Halloween H20. Next!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome I can‚Äôt wait to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To kill the boogeyman, call john wick"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anti-gun Jamie Lee Curtis seems to rely on one an awful lot in this trailer. Can you say hypocrite? Looks like they completely ignored the sequels which isn‚Äôt a terrible decision. Will probably watch is when it comes to tv.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚ÄôM SO FUCKING EXCITED!! THE BOOGEYMAN IS BACK!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy moly. I actually got goosebumps
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really hope they do what the original did and let the music be the thing the scares the crap out of the audience.

ek1ePFp-nBI,remake of the original? or is this a remake of the remake? #NoOriginalMoviesLeftInHollywood
ek1ePFp-nBI,So who's head did Laurie strode cut of in H20? Or are the scrubbing part 2 and H20. Trailer said Dr shot him that was in part 1
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cool
ek1ePFp-nBI,IMAGINE
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael > Pennywise
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Washed out color pallets, anamorphic lenses with 2.35:1 ratio, too much sharpness, and a trailer that gave away the whole movie. Sounds like 2018. At least it‚Äôs filmed in Pasadena, CA like the original movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"U can't kill the boogeyman..

No shit."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Quite possibly the most generic, cookie-cutter trailer I've ever seen. I have no idea how the actual movie is going to be, but it's obvious to me that no thought was put into this video."
ek1ePFp-nBI,*About Damn Time!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be great!!! And not SUCK!!!  I love Michael Myers he scares me and I love it!!!!üòÅüòÅ‚ù£

ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 Oh come on Michael! I liked Karolina in Runaways!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm scared
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good or bad it still looks better then most of the other Halloween movies and makes all the worst ones non-canon so that‚Äôs nice.

ek1ePFp-nBI,I fell off my chair when I saw this on trending! I‚Äôm so EXCITED!!!

7. Halloween Resurrection 
8. Halloween 3: Season of the Witch

ek1ePFp-nBI,Straight fucking chills when that theme songs hits !
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES PLEASE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"super excited.. I was born in 1983 and I remember watching the original on beta video... Like its meant to be... It's out on my B-Day Oct, 19"
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie would be bullshit like every modern horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yasssssss he's back and he's better !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Waiting
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait for this !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not only do you have Blum producing but you have Danny Mcbride credited as a writer and David Gorden Green director of such films like Pinapple Express, Prince Avalanche, and Joe sitting in the directors chair, this has potential. Let's see where this goes."
ek1ePFp-nBI,There is no way I will be able to see this opening night. The movies going to be PACKED
ek1ePFp-nBI,G.O.A.T
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 NOOT NOOOOOOOT!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike Myers is Dispacito.
ek1ePFp-nBI,YYYYYEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back to stalking babysitters.
ek1ePFp-nBI,didn't her sister chop his head in the last movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh this movie has been done to death already....remember the shitty remakes?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can already tell she is gonna die in this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm torn here.. I'm glad we're getting a new Laurie Strode Halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis, but I'm also kind of upset they completely ignored all the other Halloween sequels to do it.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They stole the music from cod bo2 zombies still looks godd though
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ive been waiying for this movie for 1 or 2 yrs
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone else piss, shit, and get hard at the same time"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It, Jigsaw, Now Halloween!? What a dream come true. ‚ò∫"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So hope for suspense like in the original when the girl was in the laundry room and michael stand outside. Or later in the car...thats what the original is about. But the new one looks good so far...the mask scene wit the other Patients seems weird. Which doctor would allow tose things...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why in the fuck did he have to show him the mask seriously though haha ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!
ek1ePFp-nBI,3 movies of Michael Myers is called Halloween Ima be confused like which halloween the reboot which reboot the bad one but they are both bad
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That closet part looked amazing. Usually stuff like this are shit at reboots. But this looks amazing. She could have kept her hair short, but classic. The reference to Halloween 4 was great."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Mike owns everyone and she loses. Guns don't do anything to him.. so her acting all cocky with that lever action and revolver kind of makes her sound ridiculous. I hope he doesn't get Terminator 1'd at the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,She is old to bad it movies show violence to many copy cats
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH LAURIE STRODE LOOKING GOOD AND THIS TRAILER JUST HELL YEAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When I was a kid I used to love playing this theme song on the piano, it was literally my favorite song to play."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Remember Halloween 3?  that was a funny movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks very interesting! Please be good I love this series, please be goood!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Jamie Lloyd never exist?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse gonna have a good Halloween. They are the king of low budget horror movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Michael would be like 70 - 80 years old by now?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie just doesn't make sense at all. So should we disregard the whole series? Like Laurie is DEAD Michael killed her at the mental hospital? Michel killed a lot of people in all the movies so did everything from the 2 movie just get wiped... I'm sorry I'm not feeling it I love the franchise and the storylines but this is just like the 3rd one just pointless and makes no sense :/
ek1ePFp-nBI,They are doing away with the story of all the other Halloween movies and this will be the sequel to the first one! YES MAKE IT GOOD AGAIN!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"at the end of halloween 1 if u remember, micheal got shot by loomis and he fell off the balcony into the grass. Then when they went to look, he dissapeared and thats the end. Then halloween 2 they go to the hospital where laurie is and micheal tries to kill her there, its here that we find out micheal and laurie are brother and sister. then all the other sequels happen with the rest of his family and it gets so bad. But halloween H20 happens and jamie lee is back, she wants to kill micheal once and for all. She does. In my mind thats the end cuz i pretend ressurection didnt happen.


FASTFORWARD 

So now this new halloween seems to act as if everything after halloween 1 didnt happen and that instead of micheal dissapearing at the end, the cops get him. He escapes, and now laurie strode is back to protect her grand daughter."
ek1ePFp-nBI,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NANANANANA NA NA NANANANANA
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks terrifying.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Digging it but hate how they aren't acknowledging part two. That was still Carpenter/Hill so not sure why it wouldn't be canon.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Isn't Jamie Lee Curtis a liberal anti gun nut?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer alone is gona give me nightmares
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The first Halloween movie to come out in October since Halloween 5 in 1989. About time they released in October again. Never understood that before releasing the later movies in other months besides October. This one comes out on Michael Myers birthday (story wise) October 19, and he will be 61."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"how many fucking times is this going to be remade!? enough already the classic is being butchered with every sequel and remake 
=\"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope this is not another bad reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,This move comes out on my birthday I‚Äôm going
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is the remake a movie in the halloween universe?
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:46 NOOT NOOT!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*#1 on trending!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Some 60 year old man is managing to kill people half of his age. Time to get off the phone and get in shape.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yess, i love Austin Powers...

Wait a minute..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They just keep making Halloween movies. This is like, what, the 11th one? Not one of them has even come close to the first two. Halloween 4 was close, but still not as good as the first two. Rob Zombie's versions sucked. That guy just thinks he is god's gift to horror, yet the people he uses for actors suck. The Halloween franchise was on life support, then it was killed with Halloween Resurrection. Rob Zombie just kept throwing more dirt on the grave with his shitty versions. Now this. I really hope this one doesn't suck, because they have ruined Michael Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will this beat the original probably not. Will it be better than all the other sequels possibly yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't he kill Lori in the last one. This looks good but doesn't really follow up from the last movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"you know, 37 Halloween movies werent enough."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally Hype is real, my mom is scared of him as fck, i just woke her up to tell her he is coming back, now she cant sleep :D"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Idubbbz with the cameo 0:37
ek1ePFp-nBI,Helloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Got the Texas Chainsaw treatment I see. ""Hey, lets make more than 5 sequels and then decades later let's make a direct sequel ignoring everything else and pretend the other 5+ movies never happened!""
Oh well, I've always held Halloween 4-6 as a spin off anyway and now this and Halloween 2 can be a choose your ending type adventure. 
Halloween 7 and 8 don't count. 
Zombie's remake and squeal stand on their own."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Bet at the last scene of this trailer, the person in the closet is just a friend"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:57 what is this, Jurassic park"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol that's the Jurassic Park theme in a minor chord
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is real...  Michael is back !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is not Laurie's brother anymore

ek1ePFp-nBI,From you slutting around
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great and they are doing it right by skipping most of the sequels but they could have maybe tried to include Halloween 2.... I think it's underrated it picks up literally where the last one leaves off and there's the great chase scene in the hospital...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Did you guys know that in the original Halloween film, the Michael Myers mask was a Captain Kirk mask that the props people modified?"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes! Its #1 on trending!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Throwing out closets from home.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*YESSSSSSSS*
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's okay.   Real problem is--the guns.  Wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of anti-2nd people come out to condemned this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why they heck would he let her close that door on him so many times x3. His toes must've hurt after the third one lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF HE SHOULD BE DEAD
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Im am michael myers' sister.""  Anyone remember that god awful movie?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,all time favorite halloween movie!!! Love Jamie Lee!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It seems that a lot of people are really confused and I don‚Äôt know why because it is super simple. The only canon movie to this movie is the first Halloween by John Carpenter. Halloween 2 takes place on the same night but it‚Äôs not canon. This is said in the trailer since it is mentioned that Laurie is not his sister and also that he only killed 3 people and that‚Äôs it. The only thing that is confusing is how he was arrested right after the first movie since he was shot 6 times by Dr. Loomis and then his body disappeared meaning he escaped. Supposedly they are ignoring the continuity that says that he is immortal so him disappearing after being shot that many times makes no sense. Oh and I‚Äôm actually kind of happy that they are ignoring the second movie and Laurie being his sister because that gets rid of the ridiculous coincidence that is their connection. Now it‚Äôs just some random psychotic killer which is actually better for the story because it really makes him the boogeyman.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn this motherfuckah just can't die, can he?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cindy eat shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good probably see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,seems to be a shit ... I'll watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back the king is back October 19th this year 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm still waiting for a modern remake of The Shining.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't Karolina just use her rainbow alien powers to fight him?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is Dead!! - Samuel Loomis
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seen all of the modern films that are the back story for this film and wow this looks close to as good as the first part. Goosebumps all throughout the video
ek1ePFp-nBI,It doesn't seem like its milking it I think this movie is gonna be a classic and when people talk about Mike Myers they're gonna think of this movie first in 40 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,I never thought . . .
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hm.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yes! This looks so good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ANYMORE
ek1ePFp-nBI,so they're going to ignore all the other sequels. so that they can try and sale it to us again with a few minor changes??? don't get me wrong I don't pay for any movie so I won't lose any money I will stream this shit.  im just saying we've seen this all before
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the new trailer y'all this is the new trailer I can't wait to see the new 2018 Michael Myers This is it this is really Michael Myers does no fake trailer this is it I'm so excited yo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm going to watch this so hard...
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks like the original mask from part 1 and 2 but with some old texture add on üëçüëçüôå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"One of the best parts about this film ignoring all the sequels is that it will show that he‚Äôs not some immortal zombie but just an ordinary human being, who felt the need to kill innocent teenagers for some reason that we don‚Äôt know, which makes it even more creepy instead of some monsters because there‚Äôs actually crazy people just like him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hypeeeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay here we go. Les buckle up.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man when those keys kick in at 0.57 my bones gotta chill this movie is gonna be epic

ek1ePFp-nBI,100 BR
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dude, this look good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Jamie Lee curtis was killed in one of the last Halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit why do I have this feeling that she‚Äôs never going to be able to kill him??
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm ready üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,*WOW* dude I have too see it!! I cant wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anotha one
ek1ePFp-nBI,holy fucking shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,So its 2018 was a little kid way back when the first one came out so I gotta ask how old is he now in this trailer 68 80 or a young 50 years old.........
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last scene gave me chills and a hard-on
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween 40 years later
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah he‚Äôs back!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"please, many people grew up on these franchises, and it‚Äôs just a shame to see the milking of them, sure maybe this might be a good movie but by the looks of the trailer it‚Äôs just a mikes sister dies because well she‚Äôs old and it ends up in a big final fight where the kids defeat him but really don‚Äôt because the producers want a part 2/money."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Of course another pointless and mindless reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,Glad to see Jamie Lee Curtis came out of retirement for this final movie and John Carpenter is involved!! Look forward to watching it! Rob Zombie's version was severely lacking!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ima use sprint burst to get away he won‚Äôt catch me
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Looking good keep us updated miss hearing that song
ek1ePFp-nBI,The rob zombie Halloween is the one where the psychiatrist tried to kill Micheal now Jamie Lee Curtis gets to try her hand this time good luck sister let's see if this director is a bit more merciful
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh dear, those modern pale colors and hazy photography again."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should do a crossover...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael best not kill that seven year old black kid!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait !
ek1ePFp-nBI,I actually liked Rob Zombies first Halloween. Very graphic which was good for a Michael Myers movie. His second one he tired to make sucked tho. Rob Zombie wasn‚Äôt that bad guys...
ek1ePFp-nBI,When will people learn?smh
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this a new storyline that pays tribute to the old halloween movies? or is it a reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,As a Fan and professor in halloweenology. I think this will be outstanding . I KNOW IT WILL
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh shit!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OK. Nice. But I didn't expect the new one to be a remake of Halloween IV...
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this goes the way I think it will Carpenter is gonna be spinning like a top in his grave.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just because it‚Äôs John Carpenter makes me want to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,now all we need is a new Friday the 13th and were good lol

ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm ready for fall and all the new horror movies.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"That part with the teeth was awesome, can't wait to see this...Michael Myers is my fav slasher, I'd love to see him fight Jason, that would be epic.

One thing I really don't get though, how in the hell does Laurie think she's gonna suddenly be able to kill him with bullets? After everything she's been through with him, that makes no sense at all."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have one thing to say - clears out through - what ever you do don't watch  Vegan Vagina Juice.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It wasn't her brother it was her cousin...right?

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looksfreaking good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Make a new slasher.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this a sequel to the original Halloween 2 or a sequel to the reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I was hoping for something interesting an original, but it looks generic and bland. I won‚Äôt judge too hard from the trailer though and will still see it in theatres because I love the original movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this does well we may get a full slasher revival! Jason and Freddy get your blades ready! Millenials are just around the corner praying to get killed!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Umm no...just no.   Wasn‚Äôt H2O the last one...is this a GD retcon...fuuuuuuuuuuuuu
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can imagine they start off their own Horror cinematic universe with Myers, Krueger , and Jason lol üî™üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,where the fuck is the pallet
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Jamie Lee is the new Dr. Loomis. Nice.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought he killed Laurie off when she when In the loony bin,  I guess not. OMG ANOTHER ONE."

ek1ePFp-nBI,I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt call it ‚ÄúThe Shape‚Äù now if this one is shitty we‚Äôll be doomed to it coming up first on google searches :‚Äô(
ek1ePFp-nBI,I waited for this movie for years & years staring at a wall waiting for the time Michael Myers came home.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be so epic!  Especially for anyone who is a die hard original Halloween movie fan.  I watch the sequels but the original is my favorite horror film of all time!  You can tell carpenter is producing it!  Thank God!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cannot wait to see that 1 of all my bestest ever films ever he's back I love the tune sik

ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks like its going to be way better than the other halloween movies john carpenter made
ek1ePFp-nBI,"...I met him, 40 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank god they ignored resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like the same cheesy formula used in nearly every horror remake to date.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"so I heard they are doing away with the supernatural components and thus Myers is a human in a mask, not a supernatural Jason like unstoppable killer

BUT then considering how much time has passed, he'd be an old man. Dudes damn spry for his age"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"the girl who tried closing the closet gets killed bc thats her hand we see reaching with blood all over her arm, you can tell bc of the yellow sleeve and its the same room at 2:14 she's probably the ghost in the chair bc on the floor you can see a blood pile right in front of it and im guessing thats the same house we see michaels reflection in bc the left rooms are lit blue and in the middle im pretty sure thats the ghost in the chair"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Now that is how you do Halloween justice. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,love the slow music build up at 0:51 just like in the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will be a make or break
ek1ePFp-nBI,"WHY ISN‚ÄôT THIS TRENDING!!!!!!!!

























It took them 9 hours but finally üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im not gone say i aint gone go see it. But i am very weary about the story. Now micheal escaped an mental institutions when he was a teenager. Now they saying he was put in another institutions an waited 40 years to escape again. Im just not buying that. They should have picked up after Halloween 2 an started the story off like this then maybe it would be more believable that micheal waited 40 years to escape due to injury from being burned and shot in the eyes. Even in the first original the ending showed micheal shot off the balcony an doctor Loomis went to investigate micheal was gone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I know what I‚Äôm doin this Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,So... All The Other Movies Must Of Took Place In Michael's Head But This Looks Fantastic Hoping It Won't Be A Let Down
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So funny story: When I was a kid, I watched Halloween H20,  and I developed a phobia and it's stupid but true. So y'all remember the scene in H20 when the mom and daughter stop at the rest stop to use the bathroom and Michael Myers pops up in there? Yeah, well young me was FREAKED OUT. Ever since then, I can't use public restrooms by myself, I get scared. And then I watch this trailer and guess what?  A FUCKING BATHROOM SCENE FMLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAOFIJWOEIJROWIEJFOW."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this works, I only hope that Freddy and Jason can make a good comeback."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, it actually looks really well done. Glad Michael is back"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I agree sed
ek1ePFp-nBI,nicht noch einer üòë die sind so langweilig
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks SO good. can‚Äôt wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Meu Halloween ta vivo!
ek1ePFp-nBI,the end scence of the closet was soo scary and awesome‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ when she kept trying to close it but it kept opening and u know its michealüò¢üò¢üò¢
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will he finally die???
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I do feel like picking up from the first movie & discarding part 2 kind of takes away from the lore. Also, retconning AGAIN & branching the franchise for the umpteenth time is only going to make it more confusing to everyone who isn't a well-versed Halloween purist. Still, this looks pretty awesome & I'll def be there on opening night:)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let this be the last one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael better kill that bitch üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OMG Jame lee curtis D:
I can't wait for this!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't fucking wait üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,LMAO THAT ENDING THO IM GONNA LOVE THIS MOVIE
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH! üî•üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, looks old school, too bad the trailers always spoil the whole movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't let me down halloween remake. Or I know who to purge  when the next founding father calls me lmao üòÇ jk
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are they bringing back the original actor that played Michael? That would be awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It seems like Laurie's going to be the new Loomis in this movie. Hopefully this turns out as good as I hope it'll be
ek1ePFp-nBI,Those 80s horror vibes. I dig it üëåüèæüëèüèæ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully this is actually good like the first 2
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie was dead??!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Boycott this bullshit
ek1ePFp-nBI,glad to see there isn't a brunch of crybabies on here talking shit on it. also this better not be the last one they can reboot this series a brunch of times as long as the movies good I'll watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why ignore 2 & H20? Those made a great trilogy.....what not a sequel to H20? It's been 20 years.
4, 5 & 6 aren't good, Ressurection doesn't exist to me and the Rob Zombie fims were terrible on so many levels. I'll check it out but I hope it's good enough to ignore continuity with Laurie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one that thinks toilet lady looks like the Miranda sings girl? Soo ready for this!! üíÄüëªüéÉüëçüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jesus  I felt like I was watching a conjuring trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"woah lots if movies are coming, most of them are in Trending"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where's his Hockey mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt not wait!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mask looks dope
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I didn't hate the Rob Zombie films, he really made them his own. This does look way more exciting though"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks good wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie should of directed this Halloween like he did the last one. Shit would of been wicked!
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:44 Haluk Bilginer ‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Showing generation cringe how it‚Äôs done!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michaaeeel!
ek1ePFp-nBI,As long as I don't see Michael getting his ass kicked by Busta Rhymes or any shitty annoying hip hop artist then I am all for this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking bullshit. So Every movie except part one is non-cannon now. Such a dumb decision.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how Laurie isnt running away or is showing a shred of fear.... she's been waiting for him.....the final showdown is going to be epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,OK I‚Äôm still confused are Lorie and Michael still brother sister because that was my favorite part about the franchise I just feel empty on the inside without it end it kind of makes more sense because if Michael was Lorie‚Äôs brother it makes the relationship deeper and it would explain Lorie preparing all these years for her brother to come back rather a random killer
ek1ePFp-nBI,This seems more thriller than horror
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anotha one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"mano, parece que vai ser foda"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm soooo hypeeed I love halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Brings back a lot of memories especially the creepy piano soundtrack is back well i look forward to see the real ending of halloween ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This just feels like Halloween, and not that Rob Zombie crap. I have a feeling this is going to be good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the last time I'm gonna watch Halloween movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is gonna be so fucking good. whoever is handling the next Friday the 13th should take note.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seriously? That looks like total crap...
ek1ePFp-nBI,WOW.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit look good asf
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLYYYY
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love jamie lee Curtis as a bad ass character
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like Daddy's home, bitches."
ek1ePFp-nBI,thank you Danny McBride for writing and putting together this movie! never doubted you for a second
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so glad they are throwing out all the other movies as canon and just going on the first 2 movies. That would give this movie  a much better chance.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What was with the teeth? Michael Myers was not the killer who did cheap body horror ploys...
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh hell yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Interesting, might be the Last Halloween film to be made while John Carpenter is alive at least. Wouldn't surprise me if the studio breaks their promise to Carpenter and continues to cash cow Michael Myers. I wonder if One studio will buy the the rights to the Horror Movie Slashers Leather Face, Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Chucky Pinhead, Candyman GhostFace ect and throw them all together. Its been a horror movie fans dream but all the Rights, TradeMarks and licenses and spread out from various studios."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Um, I liked 2 & H20, made a great trilogy. Why ignore those? 4,5 & 6 pretty much suck. Ressurection doesn't exist to me and the Rob Zombie films were terrible. Don't know how I feel about the ignoring 2 & H20 here. I'll have to see if they do it good enough to ignore those."
ek1ePFp-nBI,is Michael Myers immortal
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just to get this out of the way Michael Myers is outfit is not blue it's black if you don't believe me go back and see the original movie then you can watch Michael Myers in daylight and you can see
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cautiously optimistic
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really good!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,H40: Halloween 40 Years Later!üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,CUNDY isn't needed..They don't need his Input..Looks Awsm
ek1ePFp-nBI,What the hell was he dropping on floor!!??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like Lori is the new Dr. Loomis
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS TRAILER JUS SENT CHILLZ DOWN MY MFN SPINE BRUH THIS MAYBE THE BEST HALLOWEEN MOVIE IN THE SERIES FROM WHAT THE TRAILER IS SHOWING CANT WAIT TO GO SEE THE MOVIE
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason needs to make a comeback.
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NhqUVnsR3Ec
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks fucking awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Shape returns....
ek1ePFp-nBI,FML
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy shit, it actually looks good!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fab one ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think they're gonna ruin it all
ek1ePFp-nBI,20 Years Later...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, the guy at 1:25? Is that meant to be Michael?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Soooo glad they didn't recreate dr loomis bc nobody can pull him off like donald pleasence, r.i.p"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG that was sooo intense I can‚Äôt wait for this!! üòùüòùüòù
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm sooooo seeing this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im digging it
ek1ePFp-nBI,All Laurie has to do is decisive strike Michael and then loop him around the house until he quits because of all the bullshit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES! Another horror movie that isn't relying on jump scares.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg myers returned!!üòÆüòÆ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm fucking scared.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait üòÅüòÅüíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They've done Mike to death. What we need is another Sleep-away Camp or reboot. I just don't know how they could get the impact of that ending right for a reboot. And Yeesh, what a freaky ending. Lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting for a Halloween movie for such a long time ommgggg
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks amazing af
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not sure about this one....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If the movie ignore all the sequels after the first one, does that mean Laurie and Michael are not siblings anymore?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Actually looks like a proper Halloween instead of those remake shite
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like a female Bruce Willis
ek1ePFp-nBI,That's a quite good idea for me to take revenge from all bastard in my Class.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot wait amazing love the old school vibe and man I'm just stoked
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG √çts  COOL
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis still looks great.
ek1ePFp-nBI,As soon as i saw that blumhouse did it i decided im watching this opening night
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did they seriously censor the word kill in a fucking Halloween trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope it's better than the crap Rob zombie made
ek1ePFp-nBI,"John Carpenter *YES* 
BlumHouse... *NO*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish Danielle Harris (Jamie Lloyd) was in this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally !!! The REAL horror is about to begin again. I can't wait to see this ! Let's face it Michael, Jason, Freddy they all put suspense, intensity, and terror in us all. Take a back seat you wanna be's from the past and present, this is going to Rock !!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they are retconing the whole deal about Lorie being Michael's Sister? Instead passing it of as nothing but a rumor? Hmmm... I actually wouldn't mind if they kept that as canon because it atleast gives Michael a twisted motive to Kill her. But i don't know. It's gonna be interesting to see if this movie is any good or not.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stoped watching 40 secs into it don't want to spoil it HELL YA!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES IM FUCKINB WATCHING YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG I'm HYPED! :-D
ek1ePFp-nBI,Better be worth it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought he was decapitated in H2O can someone please explain?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks pretty good. Thank god!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oooooooo we cant wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN THAT MICHAEL LOOKS FUCKING AWESOME, NOT THAT ROB ZOMBIE SHIT"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It actually looks good! Not the over the top violence cgi bullshit horrors recently.
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween: Meh Edition
ek1ePFp-nBI,rob zombie eat your heart out
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK HIM UP LAURI!!!! lol let's go
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pretty awesome that Blumhouse is also a part of this project as well!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When he dropped those teeth into the bathroom stall in front of the girl, that actually made my teeth and bones ache. Yikes !! I have a feeling this is going to be really good and horrifying. Probably the best one since the original. Michael Myers is horrifying and awesome..always has been. And I'm all for Laurie being a badass survivor type woman..Jamie Lee Curtis is awesome and can easily pull that off and make it look awesome. Not many actresses can do that. I'm here for it..well, and Michael Myers. üòÄüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüòÄüñíüñíüñíüñí"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yesss
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how they recreated the school scene where the kid runs into Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg this month is the month of E3 game trailers not movie trailers I can't. I just can't
ek1ePFp-nBI,When does thsi movie come out
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks great. I'm going to go to the movies in order the see this film. Take a shit in the middle of the movies and rub it all over my big cock while I gently rub the tip then when Michael kills someone I'll become aggressive
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael must be approaching 70 years old?
ek1ePFp-nBI,*bƒôdzie sztosiwo* *so dope*
ek1ePFp-nBI,My hopes are definitely up for the movie after seeing this trailer. Take my fucking money!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is purely evil thats why for being his age he is still like how he was in 1978
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm impressed... hopefully we can get a better Halloween sequel than the last two excuses for a movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Capturing the magic of 1978
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OMG!!
I watched the original 1978 when I was 9 yrs old in the backseat of my aunt and uncles car at a drive-in. My two young cousins were on either side of me watching it as well. We spent 90% of the movie under a blanket yelling, ‚ÄúTell us when it‚Äôs over!!!‚Äù üòÇ
Watching this trailer, brought me back to that back seat, 40 years later. I have a great feeling. 
Besides Halloween 2, they finally got a sequel to the original right!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Don't judge a book by its cover, but what happened after Halloween 5? He escaped somehow with an explosion he shows up in Halloween 6 outta nowhere hunting someone"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*He's Back...*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see this . I was worried this would be shit . But wow was I wring by watching this trailer .
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"She cut his fucking HEAD OFF in H20 man, this motherfucker CANNOT DIE!!!...HE CAN NEVER DIE!!!..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After 40 years..., finally.., this is the year that he came back home."
ek1ePFp-nBI,When u finally have the full set omega
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs cool that they debunked him being her brother. That always felt forced.
ek1ePFp-nBI,AYYYYY
ek1ePFp-nBI,So that‚Äôs where the battle bus goes
ek1ePFp-nBI,yes!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie who??
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS EPIC AND IM EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They didn't mention the murdered doctors and nurses from the second one, so the second one isn't cannon, either."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be fuckin awesome! It felt like the original Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Esse sim ser√° um verdadeiro filme de Terror para nova gera√ß√£o!! Quem √© f√£ de toda a saga como eu deve estar literalmente feliz em ver os atores originais de volta. Myers & Laurie Strode esse momento √© nosso!! ‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,That Grandma Finna Kick Some Ass üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks stupid AF. Rob Zombie made great Halloween movies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back baby! Laurie looking badass too hyped!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You can never bring back what the original movie brought,it's not just the movie, but times were different , look at all past horror movies , first/second are good, then greed kicks in and they just go all the way to 9  ,anything past 2 in sequel scenario  is horrendous, but also apply's to non horror sequels also ,godfather comes to mind, so that said this bringing back old classics has never worked  either ,because of what I said earlier, and just like what happen most recently the bomb of jeepers/creepers 3 was horrendous acting on all accounts,horrendous creeper, look like a bad Halloween costume, and was so bad that it ruined the jeepers creepers name for the first 2, so Jamie must be desperate for money ,and goes to show you Hollywood has NO new ideas, all they have is rehashing old classics, and in turn with the newer versions burning the history of the classics, with the new version ,that can never can match up to the original classics, so looks like they could care less about ruining the Halloween classic status, in the hunt of GREED and can't think of anything new, so just rehash is the name of the game ,in 21st century Hollywood  ."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jason Voorhees is coming. 
Michael's worse nightmare. 
The real killer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They just keep bringing Laurie back from the dead lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm definitely tuning the Halloween theme again this Fall.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Michael in charge. There are a lot of work
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else expected Mitchelle Myers and an all female remake?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Probably another shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It actually looks good and not over reliant on jump scares
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So basically the 7 movies that came out after the original are not canon anymore? lol

REBOOT!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hopefully this time, he'll FINALLY be killed. Once and for all. #Halloween #RIPMichaelMyers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seen it a million times already...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I present to you, block ops zombie music over a Halloween trailer!üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Look how excited and aroused Michael Gets after seeing his mask like a serial killer getting turned on after killing people 
he bangs his own head in the Washroom..scary"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Du hurensogn
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:22 heres my ride
ek1ePFp-nBI,That bathroom scene was truly horrifying.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's cool that it's back but seems really boring and somethings missing. That scene where Michael dropped the teeth was so dumb and it's not his style at all. Michael don't carry teeth and that's just dumb to have that scene.
ek1ePFp-nBI,GUYS CHECK OUT MY SOUNDCLOUD!!!! https://soundcloud.com/yassin-elsisy
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS GOING TO REDEFINE THE HORROR GENRE.
ek1ePFp-nBI,i hope is good
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome I so can‚Äôt wait a week before my birthday too so I know what I‚Äôm doing to celebrate
ek1ePFp-nBI,How do I do more than one like ü§îü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is bullshit jamie lee curtis dies in Halloween resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,HYPE
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks pretty stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloweiner
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg its perfect
ek1ePFp-nBI,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm not sure if ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù is the name or when it comes out
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes the classic movies are making a come back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm excited!! My family would always watch the Halloween franchise when I was a kid and got me hooked, cant wait for this!!! üòÜüòÜüòÜ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Definitely a lot better then that abomination of a Predator trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who is the lady that wants to kill Michael?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"he's not real its just a movie, he's not real its just a movie  sees end he's real üò®üò®üò®üò®üò®üòµüòµüòµüòµüò±üò±üò±üò±üò± üèÉüèÉüèÉüèÉüèÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""So I can ill him"" 
???????????????????"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks like a pile of fucking BULLSHIT! This movie will FAIL at the box office. What a goddamn disgrace! And JLC looks like a damn HAG! That fucking panic room is tired too! Fuck blumhouse, fuck michael meyers, and FUCK  THIS FAKE ASS MOVIE!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hardly ever comment on YouTube but this looks absolutely awful. It uses every modern horror trope yet still comes across as bland and ridiculous. #letMichaelrest
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's been awhile since I saw Halloween the original one. Is this the same exact Michael, from the 1978 movie?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yes!!! So excited for this! Cant wait to see it in theaters!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Beast trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,If only Freddy vs Jason vs Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like what RZ‚Äôs Halloween should have been. I‚Äôm glad they returned to the original franchise world.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ignoring the sequels, I see."
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years later
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who's gonna see I hope the mask comes off
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was sceptical but this looks EPIC!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder what happen to Laurie Son
ek1ePFp-nBI,Part 2 is being ignored?  I like part 2.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeeeeesssssss!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What an absolute pile of dog sh!+ garbage
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YEAH! New Halloween to watch this Halloween. YTAAAHBABDSABHDUASD!!!@!!!!@
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:56 is where the goosebumps start

ek1ePFp-nBI,Ooooo Yeeeeeea come on babyüé¨üí™üèΩüé¨üí™üèΩüòàüòàüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOOKS GOOD!!!! woohooo!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've waited a long time for this one, now we finally get what I feel a lot of people have been wanting. A throwback, but more modern. Several head nods to the other sequels they're ignoring too. Can't wait!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im confused i thought in one of the halloweens laurie died so how is she back alive?
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE FINAL SHOWDOWN....
ek1ePFp-nBI,His head was chopped off with a shovel for god sakes he's dead!!!!! Jamie lee Curtis did it herself!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow...this actually looks good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so excited but I‚Äôm having trouble deciding whether or not it‚Äôs going to be good. I‚Äôm sure it will üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,damn this looks creepy...
ek1ePFp-nBI,this will be the greatest horror movie of 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just realized something, Laurie's grand-daughter is the new Laurie, and Laurie is the new Dr.Loomis!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Micheal Myers vs Sharknado....MM Everytime..
Michael Myers ....the most interesting man alive..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many more times do they gotta release the same movie lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Treat or Treat?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween part 1 & 2 from the 70's are classics 

After that they we're either okay or just plain stupid like the curse of Michael Myers was so horrible ..I like the revenge parts 4 & 5 they we're decent ..& Halloween H2O was okay ..& resurrection was sighs"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm not going to lie, I haven't been this stoked for a Horror movie in a long, long time."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs lit! üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish there was a Friday movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"All Laurie had to do was set up some pallets, loop him around  a bit for the teabag, movie over."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mickey has gotta be what 50 or 60 now right
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who's here before a million views??
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks a million times better than that Rob zombie directed crap
ek1ePFp-nBI,WIG EVAPORATED
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait for this to come out, looks amazing."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I dont know guys








I dont think i can wait until October 19"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am glad they are finishing this franchise the right way. I wish they would have incorporated H2 to make a perfect trilogy but I understand why its a direct sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else hella wet right now
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back in action!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What's makes Michael so powerful anyway?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael returns to Haddonfield
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 yrs later......he's still going strong
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought Laurie died in Halloween resurrection is that not canon I'll gladly accept that because that movie sucked
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so ready!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nobody can kill Michael.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer is amazing! Although I know most can agree if they would have left the closet door sequence out it would have been a bad ass surprise at the theater!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, Jamie Lee Curtis is anti gun, but has one in almost every scene.  Go figure..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can this movie be PG-13 or R? I‚Äôm turning 17 in 3 months.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm a fan but how many times do she need to kill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,This one actually looks as good as the original!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the first and last time i will watch this trailer ...... Cant wait to see this in theater's i need all the surprises i can get and not knowing what to expect will make it that much better i just really hope they took there time with this movie and. Not rushed it cause a movie trailer can look great and then the movie be shit!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"U actually like some of the sequels. I like 2,4,5,7. Plus they're not just disregarding the sequels. They straight up changed the way 1 ended.  They said after he was shot by Loomis he was brought in that noght. At the end of the original that's not what happened. It sucks that Loomis won't be here becuz throughout 1 to 6 he was  one of the best parts of the series and now all that stuff he did and the things he went thru is just gone"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So glad they still make movies like this still hoping for a remake or a sequel of

FridayThe13th
Nightmare on Elm Street
Child‚Äôs Play or Chucky
Freddy vs Jason
Hellraiser
Texas Chainsaw Massacre
The Room
Scream
Final Destination
Wrong Turn"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I cannot wait for this. I hope it will revive other slasher films, but make them good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original Michael is back!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,In a way this seems very similar to the first halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm just going to say it now, it looks like it‚Äôs not going to be as good as I wanted it to, granted it may be better than the sequels, it just looks so Hollywood and the acting is going to be shit.... I am a die hard Myers fan, so I‚Äôm going to have a blast seeing him on the big screen, but I feel like it‚Äôs not going to be that great unfortunately."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This isn't a sequel people she was in part 2 ...it take place after two..she..nor Michael wasn't in part 3...
ek1ePFp-nBI,if only donald pleasence was still alive. R.i.p
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow just wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is the tree at 53 seconds supposed to be a nod to zorn? and I really like how they are not showing his face
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like it‚Äôs better that the directors just focused the storyline based on the first movie only. I just feel that all the other plots from every other movie would be too much. I‚Äôm not mad at it though. I‚Äôm so pumped for this. The original is a masterpiece. I definitely want to see this in the theater
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope movie is just as thrilled as trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did Rob Zombie directus film
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry, Rob Zombie. It was a good try though."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"0:57 what is this, Jurassic Park?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome and still one of the best theme songs in any movie ever.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seeing Halloween in 2018 makes me want to see Friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street movies in the future if that's even possible.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not crazy about them changing the ending of the original...Michael disappearing into the night without a trace after he was shot 6 times..was epic and creepy...knowing he was arrested now kinda ruins it ...and love Halloween 2 (81') all together 

BUT this has the classic vibe ...has the classic tune...and the classic mask which looks awesome!... How can you not be pumped after watching this!!! The shape is coming home again!! and october 19th cant come fast enough!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM READY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hate to say it...but Carpenter can hardly pull off anything as ""Snuffy"" as zombies version of h2. By far the most relentlessly and brutal version of any reboot ever!!!
Alas, I do look forward to this effort...after all, he was the original mind behind the one and only movie and character that has had me looking over my shoulder since I was 5...still...Rob Zombie though...holy f*ckola....the most violent Michael ever...and rather gorgeous as well. Definitely my boyfriend/crush as far as unstoppable vengeance and dark blackened force goes...oh how I long to feel the warmth of his embrace!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please live up to the trailer, please live up to the trailer....."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope for a Double-feature at the local cinema!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fucking shit. Fuck yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this movie is good as the first one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"did you guys know that the mike myers mask is acually an old mask for star trek's captain kirk, he's supposed to be dead kirk..like i think it was used on a set for when he was laying there dead, with a bit of makeup added to the mask , and they took it and made it all white and used the same model for this movie series... probably found it laying in a storage box one day, and was like hmmmmm, what can we do with this...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So is this now technically part 3? There was no reference to the other films like H20. The trailer makes it seem like this is the first breakout in 40 years. I'm definitely seeing this regardless, I just want actually continuity with 4, 5, Curse of Michael Myer's, H20 and Resurrection. It just seems like they're skipping over those by the looks of the trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where‚Äôs John wick when u need him
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope they let Michael violently kill people. I don't want just a bunch of jump scare scenes, I want gore!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good.  Make sure to go to a theater where teens aren't going otherwise you won't enjoy it with all the giggling and cackling.  Watch for the guys who pretend not to be scared by talking smack about it while walking out of the theater (But they actually try hard not to show the pee on their jeans).
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks dope!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Mmm... Someone should stop this sequel. I mean... want it or not. Michael is still human. 
He‚Äôs older than Laurie Strode
But he‚Äôs back 40 years later...
I mean how old is he?... 
He was born on October 19th, 1957... 6 years later he kills his sister and her boyfriend for Halloween, 1963. So... that means he will be 61 years old before Halloween, 2018. 
Damn, Mickey‚Äôs getting old for this role. Soon he will need a freaking walking stick. So is Laurie Strode. C‚Äômon make something new like a blood-heir to his evilness or just put him to rest once for all. And why not including Danielle Harris again?.

I think it‚Äôs stupid to ignore what‚Äôs been created. I think they should have brought back Danielle Harris as Jamie after H20 and keep from there."
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YES!
ek1ePFp-nBI,ITS JOHN WICK IN HIDING AFTER WHAT HE DID AT THE HOTEL
ek1ePFp-nBI,"And still no justice for Ben Tramer! 
#justiceforbentramer"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought this was gonna be garbage but after this trailer I‚Äôm gonna cautiously optimistic
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeaaaaaaa üôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèªüôåüèª
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last shot made me jump from my bed..omg #amazing trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Waited 10 years for The Strangers Prey At Night and 11 years for this !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer started off pretty good but then it showed me the movie will be very lame and predictable
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAYYYYYYY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Oh, I love Halloween."" ""Which one? 1978, 2007, or 2018?"" ""No, the holiday."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hmm...
ek1ePFp-nBI,The little boy telling the chick to close the closet door was a prank. It's not Michael. I'm already knowing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,*The king is back...*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good. Wish they kept 2 at least in the chronology though.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Mother Fucking Myers!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs finally time
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok. Question... What happen to her son from H20? And what happen to her daughter from the 3rd (I think) and her grandson? I hope the movie acknowledges it. I'm confused.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:52 No one cared who i was until i put on the mask!
ek1ePFp-nBI,wtf...she chopped his head off with an axe in H20 and he's still alive? i am confused
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who‚Äôs exited for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòÆ
ek1ePFp-nBI,YUH THIS LOOKS SICk
ek1ePFp-nBI,The queen of horror is back. Jamie Lee Curtis üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only thing I don't like about this is the title, and only because it can be confusing. Okay, so it's called ""Halloween."" So it must be a reboot, right? No. It's a sequel to the first movie with the original director. ""But wasn't there like 50 other Halloween sequels before this?"" 

I don't find it that confusing. The trailer sets it up pretty well. I just think it could have done with a different title. Nothing cheesy like ""Resurrection,"" but still."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks great and all but some scenes are just straight reshots from other halloween movies. The bathroom scene for example
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fuck bro!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have a theory on how Michael came back, so we all know he was decapitated in 20 years later right? So I think whenever his physical body dies the demon inside him travels to another carrier who is as sadistic as the first Michael that way there can always be a number of Michaels whenever the current one dies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The fact that they are ignoring the other sequels is annoying but we‚Äôll see
ek1ePFp-nBI,i want to watch it great movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nah, I'm good fam. If it's anything like Rob Zombie's version of the movie it'll be a huge disappointment."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hope its good, Cant wait!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope he doesn‚Äôt die because that‚Äôll prove to my dad that Michael can die and so can be killed by Jason. üôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone call John Wick to kill the boogie man
ek1ePFp-nBI,In real life would they rlly keep people like that alive in captivity wtfffffffffff

ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:29 that actress is a mom in every movie üòÇ, Jurassic World, Ant-Man & now this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let me quest Lori teenage grandson's friends will all be killed by Michael Myers. I hope this film has a big body count you can't in this age of Horror do like the original Halloween film and have him kill less people fans & critics will complain. I also hope this rejuvenates the Slasher Genre I miss the Who Done It? style of slashers from the 70s & 80s that were sometimes bad and good to be brought back for this generation... Happy Death Day was very disappointing for me because it didn't go in that direction which was a shame.
ek1ePFp-nBI,BRAZIL!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*The king has returned*
ek1ePFp-nBI,None of these horror characters ever die I swear ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ Excited for this one though. Glad they got Jamie Lee ü§ôüèª
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Laurie isn't dead

ek1ePFp-nBI,I disliked the video for the shitty lazy title.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey fellow Halloween Movie fans don't take this the wrong way but I don't like this remake as MM is supposed to be mysterious & in this remake he isnt@ all what so ever,that being said they also didn't add a twist to the movie as it seems like it was just put together fast not taking their time to make it a success like the original one was. Why r they showing u what MM looks like without the mask& why are they not making him mysterious? I'm a huge diehard fan of the Halloween Moviesfranchise & I just find this remake disappointing. However, I did like seeing Jamie Lee Curtis& Tony Moran in it that was the only good part about it. I antilize this trailer like 10 times& study everything about it& this was my opinion."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hope they explain, in the movie, how did they catch him and put him in captivity, because on the end of the Halloween part 1 he disappeared after Dr. Loomis shot him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes yes yes yessssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,can anyone recommend some good slasher films from 2010 and on??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Soooo we're going to act like this isn't a less darker version of rob zombies?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god this looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's that Halloween theme song that brings me back to my childhood .... that dam theme song still scares the hell out of me
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Im sorry, I don't like the Halloween theme"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wish I didn't watch this. Trailer cutters have no idea how to keep things in the dark before it comes out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is crazy!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,NOT THE CLOSET DOOR!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To be honest, the first honest to god chills I got down my spine were those three vintage gunshot sounds. Followed up by the sketch of Loomis. And now I have to wait four more months. Gyah!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is BACK!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years ago we got Halloween starting jamie lee curtis. 20 years ago we got H20. starring jamie lee curtis. This halloween. We got H40. starring jamie Lee curtis!. Again...
ek1ePFp-nBI,It honestly looks fucking excellent
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Knife flip at 2:03 is when Michael goes from tier two to tier three,(evil within) Dead by Daylight."
ek1ePFp-nBI,David Gordon Green is a campy tranny.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original is way better. You really need to stop trying to fix things.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In my opinion, it would have been smarter to follow up from Halloween II and then on... Because it doesn't make sense to say Michael was shot and then apprehended when clearly he got away and that was the entire cliff hanger of the original film and one of the best endings in movie history."
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh behave
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,is this only a sequel to the first film and not the second as well?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was there at the drive in for the original in 1978. I will be there for this one..... 40 years later.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dude, Star Trek got weird..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why does this movie exist?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope this movie isn‚Äôt clambered with jump scares, that last scene was enough to make me jump without it lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Omg, I love that sharp sound of the theme song that plays when the children bump into Michael. Just like the original :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Going to be amazing to watch however I feel the trailer gave too much away. I see most of all the people who die and how the scenes play out. üò• I feel the movie is going to lack critics and it looks like it‚Äôs going to be a grand tribute to the 1st Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hope this one is good, so I can forget about those shit ones Rob zombie made"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like Michael needs some Rogaine.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Any rating other than an R rating is not acceptable... please don't be PG13! Wish Donald Pleasance and Mustafa Akkad were a part of this RIP
ek1ePFp-nBI,P

ek1ePFp-nBI,It feels like its the first one i swear to you
ek1ePFp-nBI,From six to fucking midnight.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I get they are ignoring all the sequels, but why is this called Halloween..they are not ignoring the first one..so this should be called something else don't cha think?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,WOW
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I cannot wait !! I‚Äôm getting all of my life and afterlife from this !! One thing is true to what Sidney Prescott said no matter how many sequels are made or remakes to reboots, Don‚Äôt fuck with the original üëèüèºüëèüèº. Jamie lee and nick castle thank you for one last scare."
ek1ePFp-nBI,And wait how is he not her brother here if this is continuing the story of 1? This completely ignores everything from that film minus Michaels being shot too. So wtf is his story then if he's no longer considered mentally ill for killing his entire family. Are we gonna get that backstory here? They have to explain what drove him mad. This isn't a sequel it's a re imagination of everything Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ekime √ßok var üòïüòï
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jason‚Äôs better
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woah! Looks amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sadly this looks very poor and generic to me. I was four years old when Halloween 1978 was released and started my love of Horror movies. When I look at this trailer the atmosphere is so out to place. I mean come on....a S Carolina shoot is a poor go and does nothing for the feel of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis may be in this one but the way she is presenting is questionable and I think the story line is choppy and full of holes that will only disappoint the fans in the end. Blumhouse has yet to impress me with any of their films and this one seems to be no different. Maybe I am the only one as most comments I am reading seem to be happy and that is Okay. I am much older now and maybe expectations run different among younger audiences. I guess this is the Halloween catered to a new generation. I do hope the movie well and I still plan to see it but not expecting much. I will only be out of $20 and 2 hours of my time and if it exceeds my expectations then I will be pleasantly surprised. Hopefully another upcoming director will come forward and do it justice eventually as an old fan like me hopes to see but until then we shall await October. I did see the Rob Zombie ones as pretty good considering they were remakes and went in a slightly different direction.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Old man Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't get this quick trailer before the trailer.  Just play the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,i fuck with this
ek1ePFp-nBI,That bathroom scene made me cringe of fear
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuuuddge!!! üòÆüò®üò∞üëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now I want to see Jamie Lee Curtis in a revenge film called Grandma With a Gun.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm moist.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This takes place 40 years after the first one my small dick is hard
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see it in theaters! #halloween2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,So Halloween 2 didn't happen basically.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Original Halloween is one of my favorite movies and i can't wait to see this Movie in October!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just blow him up with a rocket launcherüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jigsaw then this
Wtf"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hell yes, i'm hyped"
ek1ePFp-nBI,very big fan of michael myers. this does not look very good
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is going to be fucking amazing. People can hate the series all they want but the only two bad movies are the  curse of Michael Meyers and the Resurrection
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm happy that they brought Jamie Lee Curtis here.
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:37 logic that you?

ek1ePFp-nBI,It's huge! The biggest horror slasher movie is coming! Myer's I wait for you ! Now you're here bring back my memories damn!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like it could be a nice sequel.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie lee curtis looks old as fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this just erases the continuity of the other 7. I'm good with that.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bathroom lady relax The shape just wanted his mask! Yes Michael Myers is the shape!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I never noticed this but technically Michael Myers was the very first boogie man. 1978. Then came Jason and Freddy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks great FUCK ROB ZOMBIE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I never understood these movies, Michael is not immoral, he can be killed, so if he goes into the wrong house, he be dead... :/"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That last scene was scary...
I can't sleep now."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Friday the 13th when
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY!!! JAMIE! LEE! CURTIS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so glad they are disregarding all the movies after Halloween II!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Movie looks great but im still pissed they just ignored the eventa of halloween 2. That should of at least been included. But I'm still gonna watch this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm pumped! üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ

ek1ePFp-nBI,Take my money now!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should have stopped after Rob Zombie knocked it out of the park. This looks ridiculous.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He's gonna camp the shit outta everyone in this movie. Better work on them generators Laurie, BIG MIKE!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So I'm guessing H2O and Resurrection never happened?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"https://youtu.be/GfEBP6H_KgM Michael doesn't want to let Laurie go, lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,this is actually looking good
ek1ePFp-nBI,seit wann gibt es einen trailer vor dem trailer?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know the moment you hear that music, someone's going to get it. Still freaky. Hopefully, this one will end the series on a bang."
ek1ePFp-nBI,My heart rate was at 82 at the end of the trailer it went up over 100
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back üî™üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Closet = jump scare !
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have a Michael Myers Just Do it Nike shirt. I'll wear it for this

ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm sorry  but A.everyone trashed Rob Zombie  for his Micheal Myers(Tyler Mane)  but this is Rob zombie inspired (Aged dirty Mask /tall Myers /gritty tone /based in reality /no paranormal powers) it wasn't great but had great ideas    With that being said B .  This  is similar to the Halloween Returns scritp  (Michael breaking out of jail escaping  Death Row)only real fans know what I'm referring too.
C I'm not hating .  I like this trailer alot it' looks awesome I like The movement looks like Myers in the original &Halloween 2 (1981)Regardless I'm gonna love this film but just pointing out some facts ."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is a big fu*k you to R. Zombie. Lmao üñ§üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mega nut
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Meh.. not really feeling it TBH. It just doesn't feel ""there"". I'm not buying Jaime Lee Curtis as a strong protagonist against Myers. The white wash of the original story line feels so wrong and weird."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This makes sense. This isn‚Äôt cheesy. This is finally the Michael we deserve.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gotta love slasher movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is Blumhouse involved in every horror flick now. I swear every time I see a horror trailer it says Blumhouse
Movie looks great, though"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers meets 2018. This is gonna be a shit show
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie lee looks amazing, this movie looks crazy, absolutely excited!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,But why the bich ass music
ek1ePFp-nBI,same old shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seems gritty just like rob zombies, but I guarantee people will say this one is better."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did they also ignore the end of the original Halloween and arrested him ??
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 Surprise MotherF...r lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Let me introduce, myself. IM JOE GRIZZLY BITCH!"""

ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the first Halloween movie that has looked genuinely great from even the announcement
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Notice all of the ""reflections"" and the ""full-length mirror"" scene !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has classic vibes to it looks amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The hype is real!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally üò¨
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm glad we Retconned those fucking awful rob zombie films that and all the other sequels
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love how they did the bathroom scene, almost like the scene in H20, except he actually kills her. Never understood that, I liked H20 but it just wasn't like him to let someone live like he did."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm confused as fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,i have been inspired by dead by daylight now i am so pumped
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really good. From the trailer the tone seems pretty close to the original halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watch them bring back jason aka Friday the 13th üòÅüëçüëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,never close the closet door when the little boy you're babysitting asks you to
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay this looks phenomenal the trailer showed too much tho. Otherwise it's looking good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is this not on trending yet? Lets try to get it to trending.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The ending actually got me, I saw it coming but it still got me. Holy shit am I excited."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OOOHHHH SSSHHHIIIIITTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 Dave Chappell voice: Gotcha Bitch!
ek1ePFp-nBI,JAMIE LEE CURTIS!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm excited about this movie... I always use to tell my friends I was going to be in a Halloween movie as an actor .. One day soon!... I just don't understand why they didn't wait til Halloween to release it..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They are investigating 3 innocent teenagers being killed in 1978, what about the poor innocent dude left naked in the bushes that Michael got his jumpsuit outfit from lolll??????"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES! Yes! Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's Back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Heel yes üòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this looks fucking awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,When Micheal runs into that kid that seems to be a nod to Halloween 2.  The bathroom scene mimics Halloween H20
ek1ePFp-nBI,We don't even need this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully not a disappointment like the 2007 Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn, Jamie Lee Curtis looking for revenge on Michael for all those sequels she got put into."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that Tony Moran at 1:14 ?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet you they advertise the shit out of the tooth stall scene
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The man that made the whole masked killer Genre popular,before it was leather face, and Jason Voorhees, Michael was the first one and he made a impact, my favorite will forever be Halloween 2, even though none of the sequels except the first movie happened"
ek1ePFp-nBI,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I'M SO EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is like 60 years old
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank you thank you THANK YOU!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holly fuck it looks scary as shit. Definitely going to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kinda scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is what people consider ""Scary, Freaky"" now days ? cute."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow. This is one of those films which looks as though it will live up to the hype it's built. As a long time fan I have been wanting to see this franchise put to rest given they took things too far beyond absurd. So, to me having Laurie Strode face down Michael who as it turns out ISN'T her brother is great. I know many a fan are pissed that this ignores everything after part one, however, I fully understand why the decision was made to have it be so. 

The sibling connection along with the whole bloody curse of thorn bit got old fast. And while I did enjoy parts 2, 3, and 4, it all went exponentially downhill after 4. And Rob Zombie's shitty remake and sequel only added salt to the wound. This looks as though they're taking things back to basics as it were with suspense, relying less on gore and shock, and giving it the same vibe as the original. I love the fact that Laurie has known in her heart for years that he'd come back, and she's been ready. 

Plus she has family of her own to protect from him, and that makes it even more interesting. I really hope this is the end of the franchise, and they choose not to milk it any further. I feel giving it a tried and true proper send off is the best decision."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally,"
ek1ePFp-nBI,AHHHHHHHHHHHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,The way mike is moving brings back the feels of the first one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Nem vou assistir a todo o trailer, pois sei que o filme √© bom. Ent√£o, n√£o correrei o risco de ver a caralhada de spoilers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween. The Night Evil Returns
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers....HE'S BAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But im not getting my hopes up but i will say this... i want this to be so scary to where everyone is paranoid all October long, i want Michaels name to bring chills down everyone spine and i want Micheal Myers to be the most fear Slasher once again...

ek1ePFp-nBI,Oooh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes! I've Waited For Another Halloween Movie! I'm Gonna Love This Movie! It Has All The Events That Has Happened In The Previous Movies. And That's Something I Appreciate! *Like If You Saw The Halloween Series And Is Excited For This One.*
ek1ePFp-nBI,SooooooooooO EXCITED!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Make Halloween ""SCARY' again!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,evil never dies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder about something about this movie did they put the Myers house from the original first movie in 1978 on this true Halloween 2 sequel unless the house was torn down after 40 years past.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Beating a dead horse
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""CHILLS""!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mikey is back! üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Only downer about this is its just called Halloween. Now you've got Halloween, Halloween, and Halloween. An original, the remake and a sequel all with the same title. In the same franchise. Lazy effort üëé"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy Fucking Fuck.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I understand if some of the creators were unhappy with the Rob Zombie remake and sequel, but this just seems utterly pointless. How is this any different than what we've already seen in the other 10 Michael Myers movies?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead By Daylight
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis with long hair is scrambling my brain.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"From screenwriter Danny McBride and the Director of ""Your Highness"" and ""The Pineapple Express"" comes the terrifying true sequel to 1978's ""Halloween"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So am I right in thinking this is a clean slate and that he only went on a rampage once in the 70s (the first movie), got caught and has now been incarcerated ever since?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh sweet I love Freddy Krueger
ek1ePFp-nBI,This reminds me of when I saw the original back when I was a kid. It has that same feel to it. It's about time we got a sequel to the original that wasn't trash.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I SCREAMED AT THE CLOSET PART
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know what they say, *Legends. Never. Die*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this another one of those sequels where it's like the tenth sequel but they pretend it's only a sequel to the first one and all the other ones didn't happen? Like how Superman Returns ignores III and IV, or Jurrassic World ignores Lost World and 3?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween>>>>>>Friday The 13th.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally! Trailer is pretty damn good,i can't wait to see the full movie üò±üëøüéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The new Michael has almost the same look as the original Halloween 2 look,except with makings on the mask like the remake look."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"One million views... well, that escalated quickly!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie üçø
ek1ePFp-nBI,I been following up on this for over a year.i am a hardcore Michael Myers fan and this is over due. to all the kids who grew up in the 90‚Äôs watching Michael Myers every Halloween while our parents ate our candy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,yoooooo ma boi mike not playing no games üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thought Micheal killed laurie in another film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank god the Rob Zombie era is over.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I HOPE HE KILLS THAT BITCH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse is gonna fuck this up I just know it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I loved the original, even loved  H2 and H2O, disappointed with Resurrection's early Laurie Strode death scene. Totally hated Rob Zombies remakes, I just wanted Laurie to die. And now I think they may have just made a perfect sequel, even if they have ignored the last original sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit looks dope!!!! Hope its great!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael was taken into captivity again after the original? Well, that completely ruins the fear factor the original ending had, where he could have been anywhere. I bet they're going to gloss over how they caught him, too. This seems like it's gonna just be yet another glossy, modern slasher sequel cash grab (I'll still wait to make a full judgment later, but it seems like that right now)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,People don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs real until they see him for themselves. I can‚Äôt wait for this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude had his head cut off in H20 for fucks sake
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omygahhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!  Just Yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great! But stop with the fucking 6 second trailer before the trailer. I already clicked on this! I don¬¥t need a spoiler with the best shots right before the trailer!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Glad to see you made it back from Valhalla old friend. Nice arm as well. Skol
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I keep forgetting Michael's killing spree in the original was basically 4 people and two dogs. The babysitters, the one boyfriend and the guy in the truck who he stole the jumpsuit from plus the dog Michael ate and the Lindsey's dog who found a ""hot date"". It kinda shows you how far slasher movies have come, and how they have basically made life and death appear trivial. Each one of those lives in the original meant something before Michael took them. In subsequent sequels each character who died meant less and less and less."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I still don't like how he isn't her brother. I get that it retains the purity of the original but it still feels odd after the second movie (and H20). The original can stand alone as its own self contained entity where they aren't siblings, or you can view their relationship as siblings after the second one. But going back again and acting like the second never happened is annoying in a way. (6/8/18)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, we now have three distinct ""Halloween"" canons that all have the same movie included:

Canon 1: Part 1-2 + 3-6
Canon 2: Part 1-2 + H20 + Resurrection
Canon 3: Part 1 + this one

So, if you like the original, but don't like the supernatural Thorn stuff from the sequels, there's another official series for you.
And if you think the ""I am your brother"" revelation is already stupid, you now have yet another series that even disregards part 2.

I wish they would have done this with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"": A closing sequel where ONLY the first movie is acknowledged as canon, where part 2-6 + FvJ never happened and where Freddy was never able to collect souls or where he's not the wisecracking joker, but only slightly sarcastic, but otherwise not much of a talker."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooo who tryna go with me ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they are going to let me know what movies to disregard before this? Im thinking anything but 1 and 2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank god it's not Rob Zombie. I'm a little disappointed they threw away the Thorn time line. But happy Resurrection- Zombie is gone.
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëèüëèüëèüëè looks like it will live up to the hype
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dead by Daylight players,  upvote here üòÜ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This actually looks like it might be good. The involvement of John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis gives me hope that this will be a succes and not yet another pointless/failed ""remake"". Keeping my fingers crossed for this one, I love the original Halloween, and Halloween II."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dread it, Run from it...Halloween still arrives."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aww yea my favorite horror slasher I‚Äôm excited YEA

ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude teach me!

ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait 4 this masterpiece about 2 put the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gave me the same feelings when I used the watched the older movies growing up. I can‚Äôt wait for this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks good, but I don't like that they retconned the end of Halloween."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, so it‚Äôs literally just the same title as the original movie? It looks pretty good I‚Äôll say. Tbh I thought Rob Zombie‚Äôs remake of the original was actually really good too tho. And this looks a bit similar to that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,*aw hell no*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this trailer using the JurassicPark soundrack? Hahaha 0:50
ek1ePFp-nBI,He has returned!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn finally ive been waiting forever for this üëçüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,C‚Äômon. This trailer looks cheesy and terrible. I had such high hopes for blumfeld. Fail.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's been a long long time
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this is amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Evil has come home

ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahhhhhhhhhh! My Baby Is Back!!!!!! üíã I love you Michael!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That bathroom scene was the cherry on top, such a sense of urgency! I'm having high hopes for this one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This doesn't look scary but it does look interesting.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of Michael Myers being locked up in a mental hospital again. It seems quite repetitive. However, the one thing I'm thrilled about the most is the design of the mask. They finally managed to get the first decent looking one since 1981's Halloween II which they seem to be ignoring unfortunately in this film, but despite that as a huge Halloween fan I can't wait for this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im getting reeeeeal tired of the bits of the trailer in the beginning
ek1ePFp-nBI,My god. Words can't describe my joy. I'm gonna shed a tear üò¢. No longer will our cinemas be plagued with crap Halloween films. Plus John Carpenter is BACK baby!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,A these movie trailers are being released!

ek1ePFp-nBI,WHO WILL WIN! CANT WAIT!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow!
ek1ePFp-nBI,the old sound effects
ek1ePFp-nBI,412 people are going to get slashed
ek1ePFp-nBI,"BLUMHOUSE please take out insecure, maybe, iffy scenes out of this movie!! Nothing bland or wasting time please. Even in the beginning. Like when I saw those people coming to meet with Michael Myers. Make some cinematic camera angles and keep the epicness going !!!"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Proceed with caution: there is a theme song that will give you the chills üò¨
ek1ePFp-nBI,It doesn't look as good as I was hoping. Still looks interesting.... I was always gonna watch this movie no matter how it looked.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH! This better be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait this will be the first Halloween movie I‚Äôve seen in theaters because I wasn‚Äôt alive to see the originals but I watched them last year and they were great
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best movie ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIITTTT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessss üòÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope this movie resurrects Michael Myers. Not like ""Halloween: Resurrection"" which was a huge piece of shit. That movie was right next to Halloween 3. The only good thing about ""Resurrection"" was that Michael Myers was in it. Pure dog shit!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Movie gonna flop and,bomb"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh no not another one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wish Donald was in this but he's not RIP
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie will flop

ek1ePFp-nBI,wow dropping the teeth on that girl in the stall was old school creepy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yes!! Need 1 every halloween!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is an Icon living!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh it is on!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's unfortunate that this film ignores halloween 2 (the original) because that film is defiantly worth being seen by newer fans to halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so pumped RN! This looks so good the mask the suit the acting even seems to be good. Now lets just hope its as gory as H6 and this will be a complete success.
ek1ePFp-nBI,No thanks...   did we really need this?  Do we need any of these?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhh my fucking Myers god!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So i'm guessing we will see Michael's face in this movie which is pretty rad, but does anyone by chance think he might actually speak? When i say speak not that lame shit Zombie put out ""DIE!"" but like actually speak? It would be honestly very interesting and perhaps refreshing if they do not plan on making any reboots after this to actually have Dialogue from Michael himself."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh yeah!!! Cannot wait for this! Even if Jamie Lee Curtis does look like Benjamin Franklin.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This will be good! It‚Äôs from Blumhouse Productions, and This cancels every Halloween movie besides 1 and 2 So no more shitty Rob Zombie Movies back to the OG series"

ek1ePFp-nBI,If Michael is human then how did he survive the 6 gunshots from the original ???
ek1ePFp-nBI,So happy Jamie is in this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So were just going to ignore everything from halloween 2 on???
I love Halloween movies minus anything made after H2O but l will.never be able to grasp just forgetting all the in between!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This will be something that Netherrealm Studios and Mortal Kombat will do to promote this movie by adding Michael Myers as a guest character in Mortal Kombat 11
ek1ePFp-nBI,I didn¬¥t feel the exciment that i was expect it to have watching the trailer and like a was saying in the past days i was a bit worried to see a generic trailer and unfortunately the trailer ended up being what i fear ...damn :s sorry Michael you wont have my money.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't get why people are complaining about his movement and age. He's in his 60's and he's fucking walking. People are acting like he's doing gymnastics around town.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait if Michael is arrested then why did he get away?
ek1ePFp-nBI,they need to make a remake of the mask with Jim carry
ek1ePFp-nBI,"oh dear another  reboot, remake, sequel.. yikes i dunno how many there are now because i can't count that high.    I assume this takes place before she died, or she's really a ghost or some supernatural voodoo is going on.   ffs"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks interesting! And I'm surprised to see people in the comments ACTUALLY appreciating the trailer. Apparently it will be the ""proper end"" to the Halloween franchise. I'm excited to see who will win--Laurie or Michael?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks like a compilation of scenes from 2 to H20. Kind of cool. I liked the Zombie Halloween. I'll will most def go see it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"And yet again the mask seems to suck. Jezus, how hard can it be?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Reminds me of a rebooted Halloween H20
ek1ePFp-nBI,What age rating is it?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy Shit, June is a really good month for trailers!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,trash Jammy lee Carter's is like 80 years old bitch if guns didn't work before on him what makes u think the shit is going to work now and didn't she die in like part 8
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,*This makes zero sense in Halloween h20 she decapitated him and in Halloween 2 the reboot he was obliterated with gunshots by the police! You guys love your money don't you?*
ek1ePFp-nBI,All I needed to see was Blumhouse to know this is going to be an enormous piece of shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many kids is Laurie gonna have I mean she abandoned Jamie and she died and has the boy so where did the girl come from ?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woooo let's go !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seems legit
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES! Finally!! Michael has always been my favorite <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This could finally be a worthy sequel, although I did kind of like Halloween 2. My only hope is they don't make it uber gory or give it a mean-spirited goriness like in the Rob Zombie remakes. What I loved about the original is it that it was more about the cinematic scariness of a mythical monster hunting you, not how gross gore is scary in a squeamish way."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol wouldn't Michael Myers be like 66 years old
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maestrogringo i think your on to something. I took quick memo picks of the court yard scene and his face in the bathroom. They differ greatly! The michael in the prison yard looks much older and has short hair. The one in the bathroom looks just like that investigator or (brit) scraggly hair and a thin beared.
ek1ePFp-nBI,when the music came I had an eargasm
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be fun
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one who can hear the Jurassic Park theme?
ek1ePFp-nBI,That was pretty cool !
ek1ePFp-nBI,The previews looks terrifying!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how the writing doesn't throw away past installments or audiences and allows you to place it after Halloween Resurrection or a direct sequel to the first one if you choose too. It is definitely a smart move!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Even though this one is ignoring all the other sequels after the first one, I've noticed several easter eggs in this trailer that pays tribute to several Halloween films in the franchise"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Old one was already just meh
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish it was October 19th!! Let's go!!! Laurie is going to be a badass!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks so good omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ooh
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHITOUT DANIELLE HARRIS  ? WOW THAT SUCKS
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years in the making.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why is it just called Halloween. Why not have a subtitle to it to show that it‚Äôs a sequel, something like Halloween: 40 years later."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Digging the orignal score. Myers is back baby!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is Kimmy Schmidt doing there?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now you know that closet sequence had to be a prank.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It better be appreciated unlike that jackass Rob Zombie's excuse of a film
ek1ePFp-nBI,Goddammit Michael! It's not even f-ing october!
ek1ePFp-nBI,jamie lee omg üíõüò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Y would she close the door without turning off the light? It would have been better if it was off and when she opened the door all u saw was Michael's white mask/face. Hopefully it's good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone betting that Mr sandman song will be in this movie? 
I loved H20 because Jamie Lee played one bad ass near the end.
Now we get more fearless Laurie.
I hope they don't make shitting himself because she's more after him than he is after her.
Other than that Halloween atw"
ek1ePFp-nBI,c r i n g e
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol that last closet scene is priceless!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess he didn't want to come out of the closet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Legend is coming...
ek1ePFp-nBI,üò±üëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,Danny mcbribe is gonna make this franchise amazing again oh yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they said it‚Äôs been 40 years I thought it was gonna be after the second one and the others never happened but I guess it‚Äôs after the first one and the others never happened
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok that closet bit was dumb.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How did the documentary guy get the mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, so did Halloween H20 never happen? I thought he'd gotten out a few times..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie will be awesome !!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY FUCK
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn this is actually GOOOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,"We're among Micheal Myers now, and these are his woods"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can someone explain the timeline of these movies? Does it go Halloween 1,2,3,H20, Resurrection, and now this ?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This WILL be a lot better than the rob zombie versions!! 100%
ek1ePFp-nBI,Any one catch the halloween franchise basically has a multiverse of sorts lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wake up people... if you pay to see this, then all the studios will make is sh*t like this. Vote with your feet."
ek1ePFp-nBI,People keep on saying this is another reboot of Halloween franchise. If it is we will keep on seeing the same thing that doesn‚Äôt goes nowhere. Unfortunately Actually  according to John Carpenter himself this would be the last of all. I like how the producers and director use prospective elements of all Halloween movies including Rob Zombie movie restroom scene &4 part. Typical interesting to see Sarah Conner version  of Laurel Strode plays out. Looks darker than the rest..
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's been a while since a good horror movie came out üëåüèª
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy crap YESSS! I love it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Man i can't wait for this brings back memories
ek1ePFp-nBI,"JESUS, YES"
ek1ePFp-nBI,JASON ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hyped because it's Halloween but it looks like it's going to be shitty sadly
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welp saw the first 5 seconds why the fuck should I watch the rest.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Spoiler alert!!! In the end, John Cena comes to save the day!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why are people saying they are ignoring H2O, no duh they are ignoring all of them except the first one,  One of the reasons why is bc he wanted to make it sort of gory and people back then weren't ready for a film like that"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too bad Michael isn't even the main killer. Laurie's granddaughter is. Oops spoiler alert.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So we're just forgetting the fact that her character died in a previous installment of Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie's first one is better than this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM LIVING FOR THIS
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have been waiting 2 years for this and it is almost here like if your hype for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS AMAZING
ek1ePFp-nBI,Actually looks decent I'm digging the mask but I think rob zombies first film Michael was hard to beat especially the way the hair moved on that mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael myers is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,I saw this movie coming there were Romulus about Halloween 2018 in 2015
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs gonna be stretching bodies and he‚Äôs not playing games my pops gonna prove everybody wrong all that other Halloween movies that was fuck around let me show how I really get down lol but I‚Äôm so excited let‚Äôs go üî™üî™üéÉüéÉ He‚Äôs Back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It looks promising, I'm optimistic.......but cautious."
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéÉüî™ #halloween2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thrills always there but its a bit too much  again laurie strode .... jUST LAUNCH A NUKE ON MICHAEL AND ITS OVER¬ß
ek1ePFp-nBI,The night he came home.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"All time favorite horror film. If this is Michael's farewell, he better go out w/ a violent blood soaked bang!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Shut up and take my money!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, I was sceptical but this looks dope as fuck"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm hyped!!!  Dude the part where he dropped those teeth sold me, that's fucking brutal.  Plus the scene where he pulls the mask out was pretty intense.  I've got high hopes for this movie I think it's gonna be great, not a masterpiece and probably not 3 stars.  But I think it's gonna be good, definitely"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don‚Äôt ruin the movie with a sex  scene to where it starts getting uncomfortable watching it ....
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like it's gonna be close to the original films! Here's hoping
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not directed by Carpenter, though his name appears like five times.  Nor by Jason Blum (Get Out), though his name also appears.  Credit by implication.  Gene Siskel called it ""designer filmmaking."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,ok so are we supposed to forget the previous films?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This gonna suck
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love Jamie Lee. Wish she did more films
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks pretty damn good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now if only they could make another Nightmare on Elm Street without it being total crap.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a trailer and for once I'm really excited for a new Halloween film since the 4th
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs coming home to kill
ek1ePFp-nBI,"the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... Evil.üéÉüî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:45 pingu
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally trailer, it looks really good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I really don't know how to feel about this one. I mean, sure they got rid of Busta Rhymes and LL Cool J... but they got rid of all the other cool stuff that made the series so interesting as a whole. So he was a nutjob that escaped from a mental asylum 40 years ago and now he's escaped again. Doing the exact same thing he did in Part 1. Verbatim. He's going after the same woman. For apparently no good reason."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I would have loved it more if they would connect all the movies together. Then it truly would be the final Halloween. But, I still plan to see it. Give it a shot. I mean it is Michael Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeah but why is this just called Halloween. That just makes it sounds like another remake instead of a sequel
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie can't shoot without flinching lol clearly she had no training in mastering her self defense shooting to prep for myers or just in General target shooting.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Good üòä
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Don't suck, don't suck, don't suck..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie Lee Curtis with a loody gun‚Ä¶.. thats the only things that looks great about this movie. Just wondering what an 80 year old psychopathic serial killer can do. if they actually grasp the creepyness, slaugher and pyschology¬†they did in halloween 2 then we can talk about that directors/producers actually can do horrormovies these days."
ek1ePFp-nBI,When will be released this film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,when will Michael myers the god of blades fight Jason  vorhes the dick of cristal lake in realaty I hate cuky and every one of thim but miky cause he has no soul and it shows by him showing up and fuking off every one who pisses him of aswell as his main objective
ek1ePFp-nBI,The theme is still lit as always. üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,Another Halloween where they ignore all the movies but the first one? Ok. This ain't gonna be better than H20
ek1ePFp-nBI,My mom introduced this Halloween story to me 11 years ago. Ever since its been a thing to watch every Halloween movie every Halloween haha THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE SOO GOOD IN THE MOVIE THEATRE!! Can't wait for her and me to see this masterpiece!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"100% hyped!.. i mean, blumhouse."
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yeah, they would release it when Halloween begins."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ugh I love ittt
ek1ePFp-nBI,Absolutely love this! I understand this is a direct sequel to the first but i still love H2. This movie will complete my trilogy on blu ray
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I been waiting forever for this, this going to be epic."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gosh I have no idea why they overcomplicate these films. Apparently slow tracking shots are the new must!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ya era hora de otra pel√≠cula del gran Asesino Michael Myers.. que emoci√≥n!!üòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Meh, it will turn out to be garbage. The first film is a classic and that atmosphere and era can never be reproduced. A good horror film really doesn‚Äôt need gore to be terrifying."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In H2O she was terrified he was gonna find her and now she's just ""come at me bro!"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Everybody getting overly excited about this, bet they did the same with the previous 2 films and look how they turned out."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That music, OMG üòÆ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is with this trend of calling decades later sequels the same name of the first movie? The Fast and the Furious/Fast and Furious; Final Destination/The Final Destination; The Thing (1982)/The Thing (2014).
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Mike probably gay by now, he been locked 40 years with no pussy think about it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I want the same thing to happen to the Texas chainsaw massacre, a nightmare on elm street, Friday the 13th, Childs Play and more"
ek1ePFp-nBI,GET THIS ON TRENDING
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This one is going to be a good one, thank God they didnt ruin it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm gonna be in the theaters acting a whole pure ass fool jumping in strangers arms.  Mikey still gives me chills and feels.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this better have alot of nude scenes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween: H-4-0
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god can‚Äôt wait till it comes out!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The mask looks more like Halloween 2 than the original. I understand it's aged, but the hair and shape look too similar to the sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched this about 10 times dammit. Just come out already lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like to could be good. I doubt it will be better than the original 2 but as long as its better than any other Halloween movie I'll be happy.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dammit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Liked before watching!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,RIP the rapist Rob Zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like it could be really good and best of all it‚Äôs not a pg13 shit sorry kiddy‚Äôs no fucking superhero here
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLYYY
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY FUCKKKK PLEASE BE GOOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,WTF
ek1ePFp-nBI,This makes up for the rob zombie remakes
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg i'm excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks pretty decent. I was a little skeptical at first, but when he dropped a handful of teeth in the bathroom stall I got chills. I hope there's more scares like the last one in the trailer too. It's been a while since we've had a good slasher movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thank god Jamie is back
We can totally forget Resurrection ever happened
40 years since the original!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES YES YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,SHIIIIIITTTTTTTTTT!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited! This looks awesome!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Awesome. Laurie Strode survives four-story falls & open wound stabs - just like her brother, Micheal."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can all love you wanna be Instagram horror models quit fucking posting this shit please. The trailer barely got released today and I'm fucking sick and tired of it already because of you trendoids
ek1ePFp-nBI,already looks better then Rob zombie's
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Damn good trailer! 
Love the middle finger it gave to all the sequels. (I did like first sequel a lot)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,why is blumhouse making a lot of the horror movies ive seen in 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love how they twisted it into a low-key revenge movie w Laurie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Everything was fine until I saw the blumhouse logo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""I met this 6 year old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face and with the blackest eyes the DEVILS EYES"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck, a modern horror remake that actually looks good?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*Written by:* 3 comedy writers
*Directed by:* the guy who made Pineapple Express"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait üíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,CAN NOT WAIT! Love all the little references to some of the older Halloween‚Äôs and John Carpenter did an amazing job scoring it from the sounds of it in the trailer. This was everything I was hoping for and more!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jurassic Park Music?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Got me excited unlike the Suspiria trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've seen some comments about how the brother / sister connection being tossed doesn't make sense because then Michael wouldn't have an incentive to go back for Laurie.  I think that's not the case at all.  I think Michael is just on the mindset of ""kill,"" and the only reason he happens to run into Laurie again is because SHE is chasing him.  Once she finds him again he might re-target her, but if she didn't chase him down I don't think he would've necessarily gone straight for her.  Remember, the way he was originally crafted by John Carpenter was that he had no sentiment.  He had no true thought processes of his own, unless they were to stalk & kill.  Once he has escaped, he can only do so, no more, no less.  He's an extremely simple being, which arguably makes him scarier, and the story of the original sequels seemed to forget that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:03 That Knife turn is S-I-C-K Can't Wait! I can rewatch this over and over!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Calling it now Jaime Lee Curtis and MM will die together in this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hurry UP October!!! üî™üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I dont get it...Michael killed her in Halloween Resurrection so how is she still alive? And where's her son from H20? Are they just skipping the rest of the Series and picking up after 1978 Halloween when loomis shot him and he fell off the balcony? They mentioned that he's been locked up 40 years which would make him 58 years old
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe I'm bad with faces, but at 1:52 when the girl is screaming she does really looks like Jamie Lee. Are they related?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"At 1:44 I actually went, ""Oh!""
That was cool."
ek1ePFp-nBI,–î–∞–π—Ç–µ –¥–≤–µ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been wait for this look good he‚Äôs wait doesn‚Äôt he have some type of power
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Grandma got a head shot from across the street to a second floor window. Imagine growing with her walking out of the house during a heated argument, get a 100 or more feet away, and you say some shit under your breath,then you're hit in the head with a flip flop and hear your grandmother yelling ""what the fuck did you say?"" From her front porch."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks freaky and scary!!! I‚Äôm gonna see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,THEY BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP NOW
ek1ePFp-nBI,hope it will fantastic
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this movie a reboot?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'll be there opening night. Carpenter said he LIKES this one!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,First disappointment he was gone after getting shot. Second Laurie Strode dies. Third there was no Danielle Harris or Josh Hartnett
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jason and Freddie Kruger, I can take....but Michael Myers scares me"
ek1ePFp-nBI,David Gordon Green is a great director. I believe this is his first horror film. I also noticed Danny McBride is co-writer. A great team known for Eastbound and Down and Vice Principals. Okay I'll check this one out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Makes me laugh that there are now three entries in this storied franchise named simply ""Halloween""."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm in!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well...at least Busta rymes isn't in it
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's great to see one of my two favourite slasher killers back Micheal and Freddy are my two favourites. I my opinion Jason is overrated
ek1ePFp-nBI,"SPOILER ALERT: 












HE DOESN'T DIE!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a real horror movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait I‚Äôm confused so when they were in the asylum which one was Michael?
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG! And I thought I had ridden myself of my irrational fear of my bedroom closet.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow!, expectations are high!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excited! Do you believe in the boogeyman? Haha. Myers is back to take back the title of the greatest horror movie villain of all time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be amazing!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"William Shatner is back to terrorize the citizens of Haddonfield & Jamie Lee Curtis once again, 40 years later, ha. LOL !!!! üòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow! This looks like it will be the sequel the original deserves. Sad it took so long to happen, but better late than never. 

Also, I hear this is a direct sequel to the original and none of the original sequels, including Halloween II, are canon. I hope that's not true because I really liked Halloween II."
ek1ePFp-nBI,NOW A UNIVERSAL PICTURE.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times dose this prick have to die an come bk?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks really terrible
ek1ePFp-nBI,big up da head man-dem  Micky Myers A.K.A the Mickster A.K.A Horror Flick Mick A.K.A Tricky Micky. SAFE  BLAD!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just climaxed, lol!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have a few problems with this movie.. 

If Michael was captured after Loomis shot him, that kills the ending of the original movie. Unless he just gets caught down the street or something, but that would be even worse. 

Michael being 61 years old also bugs me. How can he possibly be Michael Myers at that age? I'm sure it won't harm the movie, but I wish he wasn't a senior citizen. 

Another issue is that the last time Laurie Strode was put back into the spotlight we got H20 which was a bad movie. Its praise is mind-boggling. Hopefully this time she takes a lesser role. I don't mind her being there but I don't want the finale to be the clash of old people. 

All that aside, I ultimately like what I see. A lot. I love Halloween and things just haven't been right for a long time. Maybe this movie will finally bring some credibility back to the name. Either way, it's just really nice to see another Halloween film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg October needs to hurry up
ek1ePFp-nBI,That music ;)... <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,2 spooky 4 m3
ek1ePFp-nBI,pls be good

ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt she die in this series??
ek1ePFp-nBI,HE IS BACK BABY
ek1ePFp-nBI,can someone please explain the timeline(s)?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm hoping all the good parts are not being shown in this trailer. By the looks of it ... this totally ROCKS! I can't wait to see this film. Will AVOID spoilers until I do (try). On a side note, Jamie Lee Curtis is so f*ucking badass! Makes my blood BOIL!  

Gary ""Uncle G"" Brown - American Correspondent for Classic Rock Radio (UK)"

ek1ePFp-nBI,mother wants to kill his son whats better than that
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks like its gonna be fucking amazing, hoping it's gonna do as good as ""IT"" did."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So glad he is back just a shame about Donald Plesence passing would of be amazing for him to be in this if he was still alive. Anyone else agree?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dam this shit looks lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers to me is the scariest horror movie villain of all time! I legit still get scared(as an adult) watching that movie alone!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks so awesome. Gonna be the best horror movie of 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt Lorie Strode die in Halloween Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit better like
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Wasn't it her brother that murdered all of those babysitters?"" Are they serious? Last time I checked Lynda and Bob weren't babysitters..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope this good. Cause I don‚Äôt understand why they bringing her back and she supposedly died in Halloween resurrection. I do like the fact Micheal is much smaller , back to his usual size. That 6‚Äô10 mf was too damn big lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great. üëç.. Love it..  Can't wait ughhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,new friday the 13th now
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they wrote Halloween 2 out of being Canon?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope her granddaughter is lying or mistaken, because I would be disappointed if Laurie and Michael aren't siblings this time around."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.

ek1ePFp-nBI,HERE BEFORE A MILLION VIEWS! üòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Am I the only one confused about where we are in the timeline for this movie. Also what, if anything has been retconned?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just this trailer is better than both Rob Zombie's piece of crap movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I had just commented like 3 hours ago but who here has already watched this trailer over 50 times
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who would win? Jason or Michael Myers?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good.

ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years of waiting. And he finally escaped to get revenge.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit this better be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cuando es el Estreno???

ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm watching this no matter what
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I guess they just dissed Rob Zombie's shitty Halloween movies.
""That wasn't her brother."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone else notice @ 2:06 the skull, witch and pumpkin? #SilverShamrock"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm happy that the creative team decided to pick up after the first movie, and completely forget about those shitty sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I shot him 6 times! Loomis
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:02 Is that Madelaine Petsch
ek1ePFp-nBI,it sucks! I knew it would without Dean Cundey who set the tone for the first two! John Carpenter just went in my sellout box:(
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally they‚Äôre continuing from the real stories and not that nonsense Rob Zombie did!!!! Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I think Rob Zombie has done some good work but I DONT LIKE what he did with the ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äôs‚Äù. And I need to see how the HELL Lorie Strode is alive. Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,I really want this to be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Maybe no one know how to stop him""-Dr. Loomis"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back MF
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm fucking hyped that john Carpenter will be back composing and producing the film
ek1ePFp-nBI,I WANNA WATCH THIS LIT MOVIE ANYONE ELSE????!!?!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wouldn't he be like 60 ?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Only rob zombie can fuck up w good movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aye this shit lowkey look good
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh wow they are ignoring the second movie also.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs been a minute since I‚Äôve seen the films so maybe I‚Äôve forgotten key plot points but are they negating Halloween 2 and all the others
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome!! Only problem is he wasn‚Äôt taken into custody after loomis shot him.. He was gone when they looked. So they better start the film with him being shot and taken into custody down the road somewhere
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers come back
ek1ePFp-nBI,So how does this movie fit in with the other movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"not bad, that music is where its at."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nightmare on Elm Street next
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell fucking yeah!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh, look. Another one.  Yay."

ek1ePFp-nBI,So excited for this!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like a good movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite  part of this trailer is 0:30-0:50 when the dog starts to get worried little by little and the crazy patients start giggling and laughing as the British man grabs the mask and pulls it out and the dog starts barking like crazy this is indeed going to be a great movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeah!üòéüòéüòéüòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,Perfection in every way. Michael come home ü§óü§óü§ó
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this look freakin awesome!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lets fucking gooo

Really missing halloween right nowüéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Jason is my friend I don't need to worry about halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she had a daughter not granddaughter
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am a HUGE fan of most of the Halloween movies and I am super excited to see Michael and Laurie return.  I'm okay with ""alternate timeline"" jazz. I have small concerns, though. I'll be there opening night to watch it regardless, but I want this not only be horrifying but also shot/directed well. I want to have original Halloween feelings."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'll watch.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I thought it would be crap, but it actually looks pretty decent."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I can‚Äôt waitüòç, I am going try and see if my boyfriend will go with me to see it!, if not I am going try and see if my sister will. I wait for a very long time for them to come out with a Halloween movieüéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks great but I still prefer Rob Zombies 1st Halloween Movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"But I gotta know... who's his lawyer? 
Countless murders and yet, no death penalty. 
I need that lawyer on speed dial... for everything."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aaaaaaand I'm fully erect
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell f***ing yes!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus, Jamie Lee turned so old...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok this looks proper..finally.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if Michael Myers will actually run in this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,holly shit imma watch this movie i luv the classics :P
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hate the mask they used for this one it looks so stupid and uglyüíÄ i wished the used the mask they used in the 2007-2009 versionüíØ but Ig Thats not the point I‚Äôm just excited to see him back
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS LOOKS SO GOOD. I knew blumehouse would pull thru.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Waited nearly 10 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what death is.‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Reboot of the reboot
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gonna be a SPOOPY one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome! I‚Äôm in
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does anyone else not like the little mash-up they do at the start of some trailers? It spoils a trailer! Why cant i just see a touch of plot development in a minute and a half instead of it opening with 'oh hey btw is a spooky movie remember'? Idk whatever
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How is this not trending 




Well now it is"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!! He‚Äôs back!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Legit looks horrifying other newer horror movies haven't looked that scary but this one looks really scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG loved it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So again i will say...this trailer has been sitting in vault for TWO MONTHS since Cinemacon and we public had to wait...WHY?! I think it is crappy of Jason Blum/Blumhouse/Universal. Why the pointless wait? So fans can beg like dogs, feeding Blum's ego and after two months he decides that since fans begged and pleaded enough his God complex ego had ben fed, so he decides to through everyone a bone and TWO MONTHS later release it. Pointless, crappy and a dick move. The whole trailer was already described in detail two months ago. What a crock of s**t"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh brother.. This is is going to be a dumpster fire..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its just halloween h2o all over again
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many trailers this summer it's awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeah...nope. Going to watch this with my eyes closed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,CRYING üòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn‚Äôt Jaime Lee Curtis‚Äô character died at the beginning of Halloween: Resurrection?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Highly disappointed
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's one thing to go back to the original series and ignore the remakes that's fine, it's another to ignore all the original sequels, but to ignore all the sequels, and the remakes, AND call it Halloween? When it's a sequel to Halloween? Wtf"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This seems like it is  worth waiting 9 years üòÜüòÜ
ek1ePFp-nBI,That part when he got his mask in front of him the king got back his crown fucking epic
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks cheesy. They really need to stop fucking with the classics.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't like why they took him to custody after being shot by Dr Loomis... He clearly escaped that area that night.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Here before 500 000 üòäüòÜüòÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wait, didn't he kill Lorie by pushing her off the roof when she was in that mental institution? I mean she could've survived but by the way they made it look, it didn't seem like she did but anyway, I'm excited for this. Halloween is my favorite horror movie of all time"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He has been waiting for us.
We've been waiting for him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So this film forgets everything that happened after the original? What a load of crap! This is a slap in the face to the late, great actor Donald Pleasence! I loved him in the Halloween movies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Doesn't look bad, but does look like fan fiction. Won't dethrone Halloween II as the real sequel for me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,If Danny McBride is writing it it will be a masterpiece
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck Rob Zombie...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welcome back Michael fuckin' freakin' Myers!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg yesssss the wait was so long welkome home micheal!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So you mean to tell me he survived   in the 2009 movie, where he was shot multiple times (with hunting rifles) that hit his vital organs... Still looking forward to this though"
ek1ePFp-nBI,eXcuse me MS KAROLINA DEAN AKA VIRGINIA GARDNER IS THAT YOU. I‚Äôm shoom
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Didnt Laurie Strode behead Michael in Halloween H2O? Unless medical science is suddenly able to do full head transplants then this movie is going to require much suspended disbelief, as, i suppose all slasher movies do."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Didn't she die though ? Thought he stabbed her in the back and she fell from that room of that hospital she was in after H20 ? Or did she survive ? or can someone explain where this one will fit in ? I love the originals and am so hyped for this film I am just confused. Any info is appreciated
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,People are saying that this is a continuation of the original in the 70s and that they've completely taken the remake and Halloween 2 - 8 and H20 out of the timeline. Am I correct on that?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The night he came back home, and the moment she was ready for him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,AWWWWWW SHEEEEEET üéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob Zombie already did this version with Carpenter's Blessing. So I'm literally scratching my head over here.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This brings back so many memories and feels
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal Myers is 67
ek1ePFp-nBI,The night he came home... again... again.... again..... again..... again......
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully this movie is great because we can possibly get more friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,#Halloween2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,ding ding dong
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so ready!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet door scene is real life nightmare fuel
ek1ePFp-nBI,So basically H20 but everyone is older
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck. Yes. Looks awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm still waiting for Friday The 13th.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's a universal studio movie so it's legit I thought it would've been a Dumb Rob Zombie movie again..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween is a masterpiece that influenced my boyhood for its story, soundtrack, characters.( i also pay homage with this Shortmovie, here the link for anybody is interested:

https://youtu.be/A4XIL6pnSxU )
 But this trailer shows a perfect mix of old school and new school...and see again Michael vs Laurie is glorious"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why can't it be called Halloween Returns? Calling it Halloween just makes things confusing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i am laughing how they straight up ignoring H20 lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,This... Actually looks fucking awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,THAT NIGGA MIKEY DONT CARE.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally they bring back  the old school mask!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Creepy
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS MOVIE BOUT TO BE HARD ASF
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gunna suck.  Reply in october :)  We'll debate then.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where's Donald pleasence?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I loved it when the kids bumped into him because he paused for a moment and then continued to his next victim. Sooo excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im in but 2018 people bitch and hate like it's a body function so let the bull shit fly!

ek1ePFp-nBI,you don't believe in the boggie man? You should he believes in you.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks even better than I expected! I'm excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Boo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if my theater will allow me wearing my Michael Myers mask. Probably not. üëª üéÉüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,the kids closing the door n bathroom scene is creepy
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is way to small for this role michael myers is suppose to be atleast 2meters tall and weigh like 100kilograms of muscle get someone bigger for the role and maybe the movie will be good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,long live to michael !!! from brazil
ek1ePFp-nBI,About Time......He Is Back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this remake a sequel to the Rob Zombie remake or a whole new remake?...
ek1ePFp-nBI,A forty year grudge?  Damn! people hold on to history.
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,SO EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woah! Michael has good hiding skills 2:37 {sarcasm}
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh great! Of course they made the big evil character a white man!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to be an EPIC movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Evil returns home after 40 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Wasn't he Laurie's brother""
""No, that's just something someone made up""

BURN!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this one is only connected to the original one right ? Or can someone explain pls :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, basically, Halloween 2, 4, 5, 6, H20 and Resurrection never happened and Michael Myers wasn't related to Laurie Strode at all.
So he was shot out the window but survived, and was later caught by police (somehow) and has been in a mental institution for 40 years after the first movie. 
But, I think there's still a chance that (at least) Halloween 2 still happened, with the exception of him getting blown up at the end. 
Honestly, I like this new timeline they're going with."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Time for him to bring back FEAR in movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,The bathroom scene is a remake isn't it?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OH SHEEEEEEET

MIKEY BACK!!!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OH SHEEEEEEET

MIKEY BACK!!!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good lol

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hollywood must be real tired.  You telling me in 40 years MM and the Mentally insane never took a trip on a bus?  This their first time doing so, and he just all of a sudden escape?   Why can' they just let the Classics rest?  Umm how about we do a Headshot first time around Laurie? Boom..end of movie..Let's retire this Socipath once and for all.."

ek1ePFp-nBI,That was disappointing. Old lady with a gun. Erasing him disappearing at the end of the first one screws with the original but they were probably like it's just easier to tell this story if he was caught at the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"He better not fucking die, if the series end. I'm killing myself."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welcome back Michael. üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ooooooooooooo shit I‚Äôm hype
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought that was Jurassic park theme song
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ready for October this looks better than both Rob zombie Halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait for this to be on trending
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks great but it's a little disappointing that Halloween H20 never happened! That was the Halloween of my generation!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So like 75 year old man Michael Meyers eh?
ek1ePFp-nBI,damn that actually looked really good...........
ek1ePFp-nBI,when you realize after 5 sequels that you completely fucked up the storyline so you gotta make a new one and pretend that the previous 5 never happened

ek1ePFp-nBI,so.....we're supposed to forget about the other movies? Laurie Strode was killed in Halloween resurrection.......
ek1ePFp-nBI,My boy Michael Myers is back! I'll be first in line to see this :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The next film will be Mike using a wheel chair, to pursue Jamie on her walker in a rest home. Carpenter will be turning in his grave."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"PLEASE MAKE THIS GOOD!
This is my childhood screaming in joy! <3"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*Been waiting forever on this!* Fans been following developments of a new Halloween movie for years! Back when it had other directors & names like: Halloween 3D, Halloween Returns etc. This trailer looks genuinely creepy! The atmosphere is there, and it seems they brought it back to the basics, which made Michael Myers as scary as he is. *Bravo*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Happily surprised that this looks good. Def will be shelling out to see this in theatres.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Requel. Looks decent all the same.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So from this trailer did none of the events from the other movies happen? Did they erase H20? I hate it when movies do this. Like what‚Äôs the point?
ek1ePFp-nBI,am still confused and for all my horror fans and Michael Meyers fans didn't he kill Jamie lee Curtis in Halloween resurrection¬† but I still love it and it better top rob zombie remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watched this in school
ek1ePFp-nBI,Never closing my closet door no more
ek1ePFp-nBI,Vwvneyneyneykeyoyoyelwylatkwykeuluep26p L858L4ILEUKN WOOOOOOAH THIS LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is confusing, so like this takes place after part 1? So instead of part 2 happening he gets arrested after his Dr shoots him at the end of part 1 and then stays locked up for like 40 years. So in this version he is not immortal and is just a regular nutcase which is kinda cool."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is the only reason I'll go to a movie theater
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let's see, Michael Myers was 6 when he killed his sister Judith in 1963, so that would make him 21 in 1978 when he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and so he's 61 in this 'second' film. Laurie was 17 in 1978 so that makes her 57 in this film. How does she have a teenage granddaughter? Oh why ask why."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should do Freddy vs Michael
ek1ePFp-nBI,Like how it‚Äôs a reboot/sequel/remake of the ORIGINAL Halloween....Crazy. I think I‚Äôll go see it in theater just for the music and nostalgia of it. Was too young in 1978.

ek1ePFp-nBI,My buddy‚Äôs back!

This looks like shit üôÑ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"O my good,HE CAME BACK,i want to see the movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks rlly bad.............................................i hope im wrong
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I find some of the comments to the trailer so utterly frustrating, and so completely lacking in understanding of PTSD.  Laurie Strode, 40 years ago was stalked by an escaped mental patient.  Michael Myers killed 2 of her best friends, Annie and Lynda, along with Lynda's boyfriend Bob, then staged their bodies for Laurie to find, like some kind of haunted house.  He then attacked her and injured her.  She then had to defend the two children in her care, while also trying to defend herself.  After stabbing him with a knitting needle, coat hanger, and his own butcher knife, she finally gets the kids to safety and is only saved herself by Michael's own therapist, who shoots him 6 times, causing him to fall of a second floor balcony, and even then he survives and walks away, and we now know was caught and put back in lock-down, the very type of environment he escaped from once before.  

Laurie Strode lost not only two close friends, but from what we saw in the first film, they were the yin to her yang, they were outgoing and adventurous, while she was shy and apprehensive.  They were the type of friends who push you to do things you otherwise likely wouldn't do on your own.  Laurie through this loss, likely became isolated, and lived many years after the first film in fear.  People have different ways of coping with the fear of PTSD, one of which is to become fixated on the cause, and to take steps to, in the case of PTSD caused by being a victim of some event in the past, go out of their way to prepare to ensure what happened before can't happen again.  Laurie was meek, easily scared, and defenseless in the first film, a person who obsesses on ensuring what happened in the past can't happen again would become exactly what Laurie has become.

Could she have chosen to leave Haddonfield, maybe, we don't know the circumstances of her financial means, and other various things that would have dictated such actions.  Also to consider, her remaining friends and family, most of them anyways, still live in the area.  We don't know what she's been through.  All we know, is that some point, fear turned to anger, and that anger turned to obsession with preparing for what she believed was inevitable.  Regardless of whether she stayed by choice, or more out of obligation, or if maybe she did leave for a time, but chose or was obligated to come back, she chose to face her fears head on, instead of being consumed and paralyzed by them.  She chose to prepare for what she believed would inevitably happen, that he would return.

She chose, whether fortunate or unfortunate for her, wisely."
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINALLY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Welcome back, Mikey. üß°"

ek1ePFp-nBI,There's sooo many Homages to the other Halloween sequels it's freaking amazing!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,People are talking about being mad that Michael isn't Laurie's brother anymore but you guys are just getting that from a little trailer. The movie isn't even out yet we don't know what's gonna happen or be revealed. My theory for them saying that is Laurie wanted to protect her children and grandchildren from living in fear. The fact that in the first movie he killed is older sister and then spent the movie killing people and trying to get to Laurie and kill her would make her children so afraid that he's going to come back and kill their mom and them. Maybe Laurie is just sparing them from a life of contstant fear.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is my worst nightmare...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am i the only one who heard the jurassic park theme for a few seconds
ek1ePFp-nBI,Myers or Jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,yessss!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay that bitch in the bathroom stall cannot act
ek1ePFp-nBI,so nobody is wondering what is going on at 2:21? who's that demon lady?

ek1ePFp-nBI,Funny but this looks ok
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG! Chills and thrills through my body! I'm soooo there!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm guessing the part is prison is played by Nick Castle. I wish they could have at least gotten at actor closer to his size when he younger (5‚Äô11-6 and looked about 175-185) instead of a 6‚Äô3 and 210 lb stuntman to make it seem more real. Ignoring the events of 4-8 can work, but leaving 2 out is bit much unless they can say she dreamed up most of it due the drugs."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Please stop making Halloween movies dumb fucks plus Jamie Lee Curtis is resurrected from the dead lovely. This movie looks fucking dumb.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It actually looks pretty good tbh I‚Äôm ready for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Plot spoiler: Michael Myers goes on a murderous rampage when he discovers that Laurie Strode has been telling everyone that he's not really her brother and that the other movies never happened.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will someone explain to . me what has happened in the first movies. Cuz I havent seen them
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait to see this movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Waited so long for this trailer and it didn‚Äôt fail deliver!! Can‚Äôt wait for the movie, a whole new concept, plot, the idea they aren‚Äôt brother or sister gives it a more sinister edge as to why would he go for her after all these years, or is she hunting him down? Did she cause the bus to crash? Who knows. One thing for sure I‚Äôm looking forward to the movie!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMFG OMFG!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this is sick
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait for this movie to come out
ek1ePFp-nBI,meh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have some issues with the documentary team coming to see him. It seems highly unlikely that any actual sanatorium would allow random people to just visit a serial killer while bringing in a relic from his murderous past. His doctors wouldn't have allowed it, because it would run a huge risk of setting him and other patients off (like it literally does in the movie). So for this to work in the movie they either payed some lower ranking people to get to see him or that entire part of the story is royally screwed up and doesn't make any sense."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,yes bitcH

ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else got chills when they heard that theme?

ek1ePFp-nBI,As long as Rob Zombie doesn't touch this movie its a winner already.

ek1ePFp-nBI,trailer looks good but these remakes of big horror franchises always end up not being very good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Dude they got the vibe right like I feel like I was watching the first one, I have a feeling this is gonna be really good..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That looks like it's gonna suck, the best ones are the Rob Zombie remakes"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Right on-Left off.
ek1ePFp-nBI,made my hair stand!!! pretty dope trailer.. too bad they gave some good parts away.. hate that shit.. spoiler trailer alert!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,yall ready for some generic jumpscares??? yeh boisszz
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:54 my childhood is brought back to life
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm getting a good feeling about this, because it's highlighting Micheal Meyers being a fucking weirdo.

The original Halloween became so famous because of good cinematography that made Micheal out to be a silent, demonic predator. He appeared in places he wasn't supposed to in unexplained ways, watched people silently from far away before vanishing from a jump cut, and the jump scares were carefully crafted through just how creepy it was.

I feel like this film is going for that angle, instead of ""Strong guy in mask stabs teenagers"" from the films that followed."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit the legend is back so excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,HO-LY SHIT! THEY'RE MAKING ANOTHER MOVIE?! AND LAURIE IS ALIVE?! BUT HOW?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That last scene gave me a chill. ‚ÄúCan you close the closet door?‚Äù

Good shit. It captures that old school & new school vibe"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So storyline wise does this come after Halloween 2??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Everyone here should be familiar with the idea of suspension of disbelief.After all, we're all movie freaks..Just go into it knowing that parts 2,4,5,6, H20, & Resurrection NEVER HAPPENED.& you just might enjoy the new one ..But, I love H3, so most people won't listen to my opinion anyway ; )"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg that closet scene! Sheeez!
ek1ePFp-nBI,With no relation to Michael I find it hard to believe after 40 years Laurie and Michael still have a connection... Why would Michael even go for her?? Dislike from me.. and iv been a fan since I was born in 92.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Edan doiii menebar gigi men!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE BEST serial killer is baaaack !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,AMAZING omfg
ek1ePFp-nBI,If the movie is grounded to modern logic; Michael Myers would get fucked up by a military drone no problem.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol random Judy Greer appearance - like in Jurassic World.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome now I‚Äôm hyped for Halloween and Venom!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I prayed that he would burn in hell but in my heart I knew hell would not have him.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait a minute so the other Halloween movie's and remake don't matter Now and didn't he killed Jamie Lee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Chills......the trailer on its own was fucking awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oof
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""This looks great, finally the return!"" Basically the same shit I said every reboot, Nightmare, Friday the 13th, blah blah blah. It's the same regurgitated bullshit that will end on a cliff hanger with shitty acting and piss poor explanation of anything. Don't get your hopes up. Looks awful to me and I was always a huge Halloween fan. I'd say give it a shot, but 95% of the reboots just tend to fall flat as hell."
ek1ePFp-nBI,In My Honest opinion They gave too much of the tension away like the bathroom and closing the closet door parts .

Where's John Wick"

ek1ePFp-nBI,I honestly hope Michael dies this time!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hard pass from me. The writer should be sharing a cell with Harvey Weinstein.  Stop the remakes.   Also, Executive Produced by John Carpenter means he got $50g for them to have that in the trailer etc.  I might watch this online someday. Maybe."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"(spoiler?) Well if you look at 1:49 and pause it at the right frame ( https://imgur.com/a/VEdEgPy ) you can see the guy that's supposedly on Laurie's side or at least listening to her (2:17) hitting his face on the toilet door so maybe he becomes Michael Myers in the movie. Kinda like that Jigsaw vibe where people become him, which is lame."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Today is a good day. Welcome home Michael. 
üòÄüòÄüòÄ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks fantastic!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is going to be amazing. I love the way they're going to be incorporating the original into this one for the new generation. This franchise is transcending time, a direct sequel 40 years later. For the kids in the movie that may be affected, I believe Michael is coming back to murder teenage babysitters - again. Hence the reason there's a kid in the trailer - think Tommy Doyle - the BOOGEYMAN. This will create a new legend in the story for a new generation. The Halloween franchise has always been about the 6 year old boy from Haddonfield, Illinois who on Halloween night back in 1963 murdered his teenage sister in cold blood. He was sent to Smith's Grove - Warren County Sanitarium where he escaped 15 years later and killed 3 teenagers - 1 of which was a babysitter. Another babysitter survived and her name is Laurie Strode. The night HE came home!

I can't wait!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""investigating a patient that kill 3 teenagers on 1978, shot by his own psychiatrist and spend the last 40 years in captivity""

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I said to myself, ""didn't she die in one of the last movies, how is Laurie Strode alive?""

In this continuity, the events after ''Halloween II'' never happened. It is unknown whether this version of Laurie remained in her hometown since the attacks and stayed there for 40 years or if she moved away and is returning to her hometown.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm calling it, folks! MAJOR SPOILER: The guy in the mask is NOT Michael. I believe it's the guy who's investigating him. In the bathroom scene (1:48) you can clearly see his face slamming into the door (thin, scruffy beard, bushy hair), it's NOT Michael's mask. And there's only two feet near the door, so it's not like Michael is shoving the other dude's head into the door or something (unless it's a jump cut, and the Brit comes and goes or dies, or Michael comes to slam his head into the door then grab the girl.) I think the Brit is so fascinated with Michael's story that he's decided to take up the mantle! If the Brit turns out to be the killer, it's a pretty glaring mistake on the part of whoever made this trailer!"

Hope this film, at least, have soul."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so intense! I'm PUMPED.
ek1ePFp-nBI,That mask is on point. Sometimes it looks ghostly which is dope as fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:03 - freakin' badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm sooooooo excited!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant wait!! Huge halloween and michael myers fan!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,that dog scene looks so stanley kubrickish üò± i love it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just like joker
ek1ePFp-nBI,MM is easily the most badass Horror Villain yet all he has is a fucking knife and a mask lmaoo
ek1ePFp-nBI,So... essentially it's a remake of the Halloween II?
ek1ePFp-nBI,As a child out of all the horror films I watched this one always gave me nightmares.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaaaaaassssssssss let's gooooooooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, a reboot that is nostalgically treated with care."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers returns
ek1ePFp-nBI,Great title bad name!! Now there are 3 films by the same title
ek1ePFp-nBI,MY BODY IS MOTHERFUCKING READY!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,the legend has returned
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes!!!!! My boy Michael Myers is back!!!!!!üòÄüëçüëçThis should be sick as fuck. The original film series had a good ending, with Michael killing Laurie. The bad guy actually won, which is crazy to think about. This Halloween film, obviously, discounts the events of the original film series, after the first installment. That's epic. What a way to bring back these amazing characters. I love Jamie Lee Curtis.üòçI own all of the Halloween films, except for Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, because that movie sucks and it was/is an insult to the franchise. Sometimes in life, Laurie wants to kill Michael Myers. Should be epic, y'all.

TERRANCE OUT üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Emmm hello , Michael myers IS Laurie's brother , emm hello"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Officers be on the look out for a geriatric nut job in a mask..... hell be walking even slower than he use to in the 70's....... if that's possible"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Calling it right now the guy doing the doc about Micheal is a Loomis.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Doesn't make sense. He's her brother in the first movie, but not in this? Am I missing something?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So if 40 years past. Does that mean Michael is an old 60-65 year old man? Haha he is going to need to walk even slower.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OK, I just jumped out of my seat at the end, even though I knew exactly what was going to happen. Love It!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't cha just love how epic movie trailers drop around the same time to just completely overwelm you with hype?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why reboot h20  again?
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs lit !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im pretty fucking hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm glad Carpenter came back to produce this one. Fun fact: Carpenter did the ORIGINAL and after that it was different directors. Carpenter even said this is the ACTUAL SEQUEL to HAALLOWEEN 1 everything else is thrown out. This is his true sequel to Halloween 1. So excited to see his work on halloween one more time.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This chick needs a military grade mini gun mounted on her roof for the shit storm that's about to hit not a god damn revolver lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHEN!!??
ek1ePFp-nBI,i just cum...
ek1ePFp-nBI,JASON MYERS MAN!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wooohoooo looks decent Michael is back I‚Äôll be there!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,There better be justice for Ben Tramer üò§
ek1ePFp-nBI,Make Michael Great Again!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Too bad it‚Äôs not a Rob Zombie film but I‚Äôm still excited!
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YEAH!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"We're going to erase all the stuff that was done after the first Halloween so we can redo all the stuff that was done ever since.

And, really, the third movie to be called Halloween? If it's supposed to be a sequel to the original, this is a first. Imagine if the sequel to Star Wars was called Star Wars?!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY F*** YES!
ek1ePFp-nBI,H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéâüéäüéâüëèüëèüëèAnd Rob Zombie has no hand in it so...it should be good. Looking forward to the real things that made Micheal scary. Not a stitched mask or running. Just Micheal stalking in a Halloween mask.  Jaime Lee Curtis looking forward to her. High hopes for this movie. (Not too high. But high)
ek1ePFp-nBI,*The Shape has returned*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Haluk Bilginer'i netlememi≈üler bile yazƒ±k, insan sƒ±fatƒ±nƒ± 2 saniye dahi olsa g√∂sterir fragmanda."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is anybody else bothered by the fact that laurie is overly prepared? I mean Mr Myers definately scared her but if they are erasing all the damage he has done over the years and just sticking to part one then it seems like too much. Ugh
ek1ePFp-nBI,AMAZING! I can't wait!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm very very proud, of my bro Michael. Now where's my new movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thats one scary ass monster. Michael's pretty scary too.
ek1ePFp-nBI,My dads been wanting this movie for 40 years
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers > All other slashers.   Finally something worthy of being called ""Halloween"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,How was he caught may I ask???
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it me. But seeing Michael again just brings beautiful tears to my eyes lmao.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My 9yr old daughter and I watching the trailer... 

Me: That was awesome!! Let's watch it again!! 

Daughter: No dad, I don't like teeth!!

Me: Neither does Michael...

#Halloween2018"
ek1ePFp-nBI,hope this movie brings back the slasher movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excited for This!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, after 40 years, and relentless amounts of mediocre attempts of making Michael Myers a b-horror movie staple. I get what looks like an honest attempt at recreating the cinematic magic that was John Carpenter's Magnum Opus. I suppose, recreating will not do justice here. An attempt at honorably continuing on something that has changed the entire course of cinema. Movies like these are not meant to be approached lightly, but with ambition. David Gordon Green has taken upon him a daunting task, which looks to be a valorous effort. 

It may not be 1978, greatest horror movie of all time, great. But it can be a solid close out to the most iconic Horror movie of all time. A valiant coming home story of a Psycho, and a traumatized aged baby sitter, squaring off for legacy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The scene where a grown ass man is allowed to go into a mental institution and antagonize the patient is a ridiculous scene.
ek1ePFp-nBI,yes.Yes.YEs.YES. Y ES. Y E S!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,How long until this is on trending?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm actually kinda disappointed by this trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit this looks like the best Halloween sequel ever!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so ready
ek1ePFp-nBI,I dont see that its a big deal if she is her brother or not. She waited for him and he waited for her because she was the survivor from the first and she lost loved ones because of him.
ek1ePFp-nBI,üí™üî•üî™üî•üí™
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hope they can keep up with Rob Zombies I thought his makings of Halloween was better than allot of the sequels Made I grew up in the Halloween and Jason, Freddy Krueger erea so I'll have to wait and see"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is fucking interesting I can't believe there's a little reference to the original scenes like him grabbing the kid and peering in the door way.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hold the fuck up, didn't Laurie die in Halloween ressurection?!?!??! So who tf is this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,rob zombies was way better than this bs
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lmao just get John Wick to kill him. It ain't that hard
ek1ePFp-nBI,If you look closely at 1:49 you can see it‚Äôs not michael‚Äôs head hitting the bathroom stall it‚Äôs him smashing someone else‚Äôs head into it that‚Äôs good ol mike for you lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Same old shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The Rob Zombie's Michael was like 6 foot 7 close to 300 lbs, this dude is like 5 foot 10, 170 lbs. I'm not buying the anorexic Michael."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"4 MORE MONTHS TIL HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEEN!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did anyone see some kids warring silver shamrock masks at the part ware Jamie is telling the kids to run?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,There‚Äôs one man you send to kill the boogeyman man. John Wick
ek1ePFp-nBI,So they went to the looney house and baited him with his own mask...WHY IN THE EFFIN WORLDüò°
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael... Michael Myers. (Halloween theme plays) --get chills down the spine! CAN'T WAIT!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Noone wanting an explanation as to how she survived her ""death"".... No? Just me.... Okay ill leave"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stop it !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaaaaaaaas!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its Christmas for Halloween fans! Trailer looks awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This...is... awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its seems like i saw the whole movie in this trailer!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nappy head psycho back in the house !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh damn
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes yes yes yes yes yes and yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,Everyone jumped at the last part but I didn‚Äôt but the trailer was still litty af.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks AMAZING‚ù§‚ò∫
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if Dr. Loomis is brought up in the beginning of the film. I understand he has passed but would be cool to mention him. Can‚Äôt have a Halloween film without him.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg my year just got better
ek1ePFp-nBI,*sigh*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessssss!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok I wish they didn't show that closet door scene, that was legitimately scary.  They should have saved that one for the theater.  Hopefully there's other good scares like that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok I'm fine with no blood relation sure. Adds the original slasher element,but at please don't make him simple mental. Gotta make em a supernatural evil force."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wut
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Holy shit, he's back!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They said it will be better than H20, it doesn't seem so"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thank God, it looks like it's only going off the original 2 and then making the rest not cannon"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Even the Dog is afraid of him LOL
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this apart of the Dark Universe?







J.K. This looks really cool"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I dig it. He was shot and taken in to custody. I'm all in no need to see anymore.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where's John Wick I heard he was hired to kill the ficking boogeyman
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sister V Brother
The Final Showdown!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice dude
ek1ePFp-nBI,fooook that last scene and music üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks a bit too action-packed, not enough horror. Also retconning Halloween 2 is fucking retarded 1:04"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"okay that closet door shit actually got me.
well played

can't wait ;)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maaaannnnn! Really Scary üòì
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh boy another H2O! oh boy another movie that doesn't reference 4,5& 6.  Now we have 3 timelines 4 if you count the Rob Zombie movies. (1,2,4,5 & 6) or (1,2, H2O & Resurrection) or (1,2 & This one) or (ROB ZOMBIE 1st movie Rob Zombie 2nd Movie)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!!!!! Michael is BACK!!! And Halloween Is Gonna Be AWESOME Again!!!!! One of the best Icons in Horror History! Looking foward to this year's Treat!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pause at 1:50

ek1ePFp-nBI,"""The bus crashed....what bus?""..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I love that movie trailers show a mini trailer before the actual trailer starts now. Let's just start showing a mini mini trailer before the mini trailer, this way I can prepare myself for the upcoming mini trailer of the trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sooo.......what about Halloween H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not impressed. It looks like a blander and dumber version of the remake with worse acting.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is where the fun begins
ek1ePFp-nBI,The G.O.A.T üí™üèø‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have been waiting for this a long time! #halloween2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,The teenagers don't believe Michael existed?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn cant wait for this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I read a comment below that I agree with. Hopefully they address it in the movie. If they're only acknowledging the original, and this as a sequel to that, what would Laurie's motivation be to always be on the lookout for him? I mean, after 40 years, you get a bit complacent. They should've at least acknowledged part 2 and H20."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Give me an AR-15 and will see who‚Äôs the boogie man. Honestly movies like these piss me off, you can easily kill a man with a knife. Plus you have a gun and someway he kills you..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"....yeah, I think I'll stick with Halloween 2 as the sequel to the first film. Thanks, though."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"After Halloween resurrection and rob zombie almost killed the franchise, I can confidently say Michael is home."
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should stuck with the original story line.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fucking shit!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's your time to shine Laurie! Finish him!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's finally come home
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now I've about had it. Keeping him locked up is not working. Because this motherfucker is gonna keep magically escaping to come get your ass. Now he should've gotten death penalty for all those murders unless the state doesn't permit it. Even if they don't, Laurie when you catch him or get him unconscious, cut his head off and burn his body. Then spread ashes in multiple spots in the world. And if you cant travel the world, do the U.S. or multiple spots in your state. Girl, he can't come back unless he is summoned or becomes a demon. And if he comes back get a priest to perform an exorcism. Jesus Christ, this ninja been alive for 40 years making you scared, girl if you dont behead him, I swear on my cat children souls, I'm on yo ass myself Fuck! I love this series but I know I'm not the only one who feels like this lmaoüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this the origin story for John Wicks Nickname???
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:50 at least she was in the right place XD
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait to be disappointed by this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Trailer shows to much
ek1ePFp-nBI,Closet scene scared the piss out of me...hope there are many more jump scares!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Maybe I'm nit picking, but without Michael continually returning in the sequels and without Laurie and Michael being siblings, what reason would Laurie have to be obsessively waiting for him for 40 years? I understand why they wanted to throw the sequels out but if nothing else they established that Michael never goes away and won't rest until he gets Laurie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,B A D A S S
ek1ePFp-nBI,251 DISLIKES?!!! Honestly people!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Whoever dislikes this sucks lol , this movie is going to be awesome !!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Don't know how this film will turn out but they made one great adjustment from H20 and the others after it.  U can't see his eyes.  Michael was always creepier when the eye sockets in the mask where basically dark voids.  Well done so far, well done"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is it sad I have watched this trailer over 40 times
ek1ePFp-nBI,JAMIE LEE CURTIS LOOKS LIKE A BADASS IN THIS MOVIE AND JOHN CARPENTER IS A EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. IM SO HYPE.
ek1ePFp-nBI,DAMN Laurie Strode bout to go Sarah Connor on Michael Myer's ass
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally after years waiting...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear if I found out michael Myers was in my house I wouldn‚Äôt ask if somebody was inside I would just run the house like bye have a nice time
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i wanna play duos wit this guy, easy dub"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now let's get the Kane Hodder Jason reboot!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yas and John Carpenter is back and jamieee and nick castle!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeet
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks like the movie picks and chooses various elements of the sequels and repackages them together in a new movie.(isolated gas station-type bathroom scene, Laurie waiting for his return and prepared to fight back, young filmmakers trying to make money off the '78 story, decaying mask, sketches of Loomis, closet scene, walking through town scenes (students and MM), etc. Still can't wait to watch it, but I'm disappointed in that it appears to be a patchwork of what has already been done in the other sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,it should be coming out on Halloween :{
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did they undo everything that happened after the first one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so there
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh boy
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow. This looks good. H20 was the last good Halloween. 
Happy to see that this movie might actually do well."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"David Gordon Green knows how to scare the shit out of us when he wants to. He's why Jamie Lee Curtis said, 'Yeah. What the hell.' Can't wait."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I liked the little nudge of the brother sister relationship michael and laurie had in the other movies. Liked that. Sadly gotta see em not as siblings this time. Still hyped!
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúHey Jerk speed Kills!!‚Äù classic line from the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks so good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes Yes Yes Yes !!!!!!! Awesome trailer #TheBoogeymanreturns
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking YASSSSSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,2nd favor
ek1ePFp-nBI,I had like no anticipation for this. Consider me excited now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's coming
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG fucking amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looking very good, it‚Äôs going to be a long wait until Halloween 2018. No more trailers now..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don‚Äôt know  they made Michael Myers seem a little more mortal like he can die easily or something than his past movies maybe it‚Äôs just me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Look's interesting, almost feels like Michael might be playing the victim in this one being hunted by a deranged senior citizen."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks so good can't wait to go see Halloween now I love all of the Halloween movies
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚ô´ Oh, what can it mean to a Daydream Believer and a Homecoming Queen! ‚ô´

Finally a good sequel to the best horror movie of all times again! :D"
ek1ePFp-nBI,# where is the  new Friday the 13 movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"alright, as long as the writing doesn't get too fucking cheeky this could be excellent."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo that was tight when Michel was in the closet like the boogy man
ek1ePFp-nBI,B E T
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Despite Rob Zombie butchering the franchise with his reboots, I still think Tyler Mane is a good pick to play Michael. He doesn‚Äôt speak so it could really be anyone, but Mane is extremely tall, powerful, and intimidating. He just looks like he could throw you around with ease. Michael is average height in the other films, but having him tower above his victims just adds a layer of fear to the eyes of the audience."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG this looks great!
ek1ePFp-nBI,If only there was dr. Loomis to still be around üòûüò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So the lady in the stall dies as well as the British guy, how else would he get his mask?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait for this !
ek1ePFp-nBI,√ßa promets !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hate the mini-trailer before the trailer trend.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing ‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just hope kids my age will not think this movie is the first one in the series
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh boy a popped a chub to this. I'm actually really excited for this. I don't give a shit about them going off ""the cannon timeline"" as some weirdos say. It's a Halloween movie. The timeline has been fucked already. I just hope it's as good or better than it looks."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my gosh yessss üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When this first came out I bought a grey jumpsuit. Sat in the second row of the LSU theater. In the middle, when all hell was breaking loose, I put on a faceless white mask, stood up, and calmly walked up the aisle to the back.

One of the greatest moments. People recoiling and screaming..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks interesting, but also looks like another version of H2O."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It was Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:58 welcome to Bucketheadland
ek1ePFp-nBI,you got to be kidding me don't ruin the original classic slasher flic
ek1ePFp-nBI,"she wants him so bad that I just pictured her all alone sitting in a kitchen full of balloons, fisting cake into her mouth celebrating his 1st day out of prison welcome back party"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I also can‚Äôt wait for the next Jason a lot of those were good
Some were bad

Cough cough Jason x"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesss it‚Äôs made with Blum house!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh god FUCK YES and guess what bitches JOHN CARPENTER is on board for this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm a real OG , all the killers know me, made a million off of movies and I ain‚Äôt ever speak‚Äù- Michael Myers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When making this film, the directors and cast should all wear W.W.RZ.D.? ‚Äî ‚Äúwhat would rob zombie do?‚Äù And any thoughts, ideas, or decisions should be met with this question. If the answer to any idea is ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, that idea should be instantly dismissed."
ek1ePFp-nBI,yesssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice! üëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,I assume Laurie here is around her 50's? while Micheal is around his 60's? I can't tell tbh. Because they say when you're heavily stressed and depressed your hair turns white or grey. So I can't tell whether she's 40/50/60 here.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Here before 1,000,000 views in my Dr.Evil voice."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hes returned
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait I‚Äôm confused in terms of what this movie will take place in which Halloween universe. Is it Rob zombie or the originals?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its going to be mind-blowing hohohaaaaaaaaaüòüüòüüòüüòü
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks absolutely awful; just pissed all over fans of the franchise and sequels who bought their tickets and paid cash in good faith only to be smacked in the face 20 years after h20 and 37 years after h2 and say, FU*K all the noise.  Just give us more money...  LAME."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Excuse me... What?...
ek1ePFp-nBI,So basically this is h40? I got a meh feeling about this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 Oh come on!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Butchering Rob Zombie's masterpiece already?
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE KILLER HAS COME BACK
ek1ePFp-nBI,"There is nothing now, like the old scary movies from back in the dayüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ hopefully it shows our new generation what we use to fear back when movies were good and truly scary ü§°üë£üéÉüìΩüéûüìπ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,H40 üòèüôÑ lol jk glad Halloween is going back to form and none of that Rob Zombie edgy shit this time üòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanted to Know if this one is reboot or a Sequel?
ek1ePFp-nBI,yasssss bitch!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So basically fuck all the other sequels huh?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"God, another one, please stop."
ek1ePFp-nBI,okay laurie and michael are not siblings anymore but michael is still not 'human'.the scene in the hospital with michael and the guy that has the mask.the reaction from the dog and from the crazy people around michael...the way he hit his head in the toilet's door..he suddenly appears in the closet when obviously he wasn't there before..he's still a supernatural force and not just a crazy guy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhhhh shiiiiiiiit TTT
ek1ePFp-nBI,KILL MICHEAL
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie Lee Curtis. Nick Castle. John Carpenter. Now THIS is the TRUE sequel to the 1978 Halloween!
Looks amazing, can't wait to finally see Michael again! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•"
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"never fails to
Come back does it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When do the tickets go on sale I want 10 please, one for each day of my pending vacation"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've waited since 2016 to see this when they announced it and its finally here
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This the type of scary movies I like, not no paranormal shit"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Absolutely can't wait :P First horror then fun action sci-fi with Star Wars afterwards :P
ek1ePFp-nBI,I might be in the minority but I loved Rob Zombie's michael mask better
ek1ePFp-nBI,YAAAAAAAAASSS I LOVED THESE MOVIES (most of them)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"233 dislikes was hoping this was a Friday the 13th trailer.  
P. S.  I love the Friday the 13th  movies so yea"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the real movie that stoled Halloween years ago
ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogeyman has returned and does not want you‚Äôre candy
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone just kill him already
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks fucking amazing I‚Äôm so hyped I have goosebumps
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Absolutely EPIC!!!!

US true fans can't wait to see this. All of that bullshit that Rob Zombie put out was trash and shameful to this epic and iconic character and franchise."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Legend Is BACK !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,She's drinking BOBA MILK TEA 0:57 lol never thought I'd see that in an American film.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sorry micheal shouldn't lose to a 70 year women.  Kill her micheal
ek1ePFp-nBI,If it‚Äôs pg-13 It‚Äôs gonna suck . Cause I know  directors get greedy and want a wider audience and ruin it for everyone. But we all know they are not gonna do that....right?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched this trailer about like 20 times just fucking excited for this movie the first one is the best but this one is hopefully gonna be better than the all the other movies for sure can't wait Myers back in this bitch üíØüíØüíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE HYPE IS RRRRREEEEEEAAAAAAAALLLLLLL
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why would it not come out on Halloween lol but I'm still seeing this like this shit was legit right here
ek1ePFp-nBI,Very good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This my nigga  can't wait for the new movie 2k18 halloween let's go üí™üí™üëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 scared the hell out of me
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM SO FUCKING READY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Idk what it is about 2:20 but the way Jamie says ""Micheal"" gets me so excited. Like she's ready for him."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good bring on October
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It reminds Me of H4, H6, and H20.  It might be pretty good, but I have other ideas."
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELLYEAH!!! FINALLY !!!MICHAEL MYERS HAS COMEBACK TO TAKE OVER HALLOWEEN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cannot wait üò´
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lit üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,YYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
ek1ePFp-nBI,He has returned
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mask is a William shatner mask from Star Trek Incase you didn‚Äôt know.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I guess you can say that this is the real Halloween 3 that we never got but now we do
ek1ePFp-nBI,"so this is the real original part 2 and everything else was an illusion?

edit: he ghosted at the end of the first one so how did they capture him? michael baying this shit?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks great! I'm excited for it to come out! However, I wish they still followed behind H2 and H2O since it would make a lot of sense. Cos why would Laurie be prepared to fight some 'random guy that tried to kill her one night' after 40 years? They should've just kept them as siblings and included the H2 sequel, cos it would make a lot more sense why Laurie would still be paranoid after what she went through that night in the hospital and finding out the reason he's after her is cos she's his sister. And they should've had John and Molly return. They keep switching things up between Jamie, John now another kid? Screw Resurrection, that one wasn't as good. But I'm glad they finally made another Halloween movie I thought they'd never do it! My favorite killer is backüòâ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn this looks good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why isn‚Äôt this on trending?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope this does well, but does not become all trendy like IT did....I grew up in the 80s, so I've had to see things close to my heart become the newest bandwagon riding trend. Again, I hope its successful, and it does look good..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,":)IM A MONSTER, and EVERYDAY IS HALLOWEEEENNNN-"
ek1ePFp-nBI,We need a game of Myers by himself! Like friday the 13thüòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I SHOT HIM SIX TIMES!!!! SIX TIMES!!! Literally jizzed in my pants watching this trailer!!!! Can't wait till October!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome. Cannot fucking wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,What is she saying at 1:05? Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Eh
ek1ePFp-nBI,The prince of HALLOWEEN is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Chills as soon as that music kicked  in at 1:55
ek1ePFp-nBI,YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'll be watching this!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Miss you Micheal ! long time ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Goosebumps
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeeeeah can't wait to make this new costume and life-sized baby!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,has hollywood just ran out of ideas? *MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL FOR CHRIST SAKES!!!!!!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is my all time favourite film and this looks awesome!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE NIGHT HE CAME HOME üéÉüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesss Michael is back babyüòÉüòÉüòÉüòåü§ìhopefully its not trash
ek1ePFp-nBI,AWESOME!!!!!!!! JOHN CARPENTER CAN NEVER FAIL!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is part financed by Miramax which is Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs company. Interesting.
ek1ePFp-nBI,128k already.  This movie is gonna blow up in theaters
ek1ePFp-nBI,So... H20 never happened (just to confirm)?
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH MICHEAL MYERS BACK BEIN A SAVAGE
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:26 That kid better survive in the movie or I‚Äôm going to feel really bad. üòû Also bro I‚Äôm so HYPED!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So they take the only interesting thing about these movies away, the fact they were siblings. This seem less interesting remake of H20. At least that had a boy he was going after instead of the same old same old females and LL cool J."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I will miss Donald Pleasance... but damn I have wanted another Halloween for so many years now.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who isn't going to Halloween after watching this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank god this is the sequel to the original film and not the shitty rob zombie ones.
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25K2aTTgsOA
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween h20 2.0
ek1ePFp-nBI,showwwwwww!
ek1ePFp-nBI,yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jamie Lee Curtis looks like Madea. Is this ""Boo! A Madea Halloween 3?"" lmfao

I've been waiting for this film. And I hope it doesn't disappoint. But I have a feeling it's going to be mixed reviews and just considered ""okay."" It looks like two movies in one. English folks researching a murder and Madea running amok on Halloween night without the comedy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,rather have a halloween 3 by rob zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck this up, and I‚Äôll be extremely pissed. This looks very promising though.


EDIT: THIS WAS AMAZING!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This might actually be good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't watch this movie trailer seriously after playing Dead By Daylight.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The classic Halloween music
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay How Many Movies Do They Have To Make? I Mean The Dude Has 11 Movies or Something.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this looks... bad.  Rob Zombie did a good job with a gritty take on halloween.  Just do a Halloween / Devils Rejects mashup.  I'd love to see Michael take out that crew.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaassss!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ive never seen someone so chill when a door has been slammed on them several times in a row
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seems like a ""remake"" of H20."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, I don't love that they retconned H20 but this trailer was AMAZING! It really makes me wish it was Fall instead of Summer. : ("
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guessss whoooo‚Äôsss baaaackkkk
ek1ePFp-nBI,_internal screaming_
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dude I‚Äôm crying of nostalgia
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I WAS BORN FOR THIS!!!


BUT I will not die until I see this movieüòú"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was casually playing Dead by daylight with Michael Myers and then 20 minutes after i see this trailer LOL
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween Return
ek1ePFp-nBI,WOHOOO I'M SO EXCITED !! OUT SLASHER FAVS ARE BACK!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I think they screwed the pooch with this one, tbh...It should have started directly after the second film, not the first....That would explain sam loomis' death in the hospital fire, and no need to possibly reintroduce him as a new actor....

Just my $0.02"
ek1ePFp-nBI,where's the blood ? is it PG 13 ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS SHIT IS SO MOTHERFVCKN GOOD
ek1ePFp-nBI,How she got stabbed twice and got thrown of a 3 story building  it's not possible
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg omg üòÆ I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie I love Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YES, THE HYPE IS REAL! GIVE ME THIS! Not that pathetic Predator stupid shit!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"man I can't wait to see this, waited for 9 years."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else noticed the keys used at 0:57 are similar to the Jurassic Park song?
ek1ePFp-nBI,at 1:14 is that Teller? lmao i thought he didnt speak
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now it‚Äôs time for FRIDAY THE 13th
ek1ePFp-nBI,MAKING MICHAEL HUMAN COMPLETELY TAKES AWAY THE *UNSTOPPABLE KILLING MACHINE* ASPECT OF MICHAEL WE LOVE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this movie is going to show on my babe and I anniversary 10/19/16 and we worked on the haunt together and he was Michael Myers üòçüéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I Gave Me Chills Dude I Can't Wait! Hurry UP October!!! üî™üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,My most anticipated movie of the year!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The male cop is playing Michael... Real Michael died in the bus crash.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes they are finally making a Michael Myers movie now all we need is a new Jason Voorhees movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know what annoys me? If it's a sequel, not a reboot, why the fuck is it called just ""Halloween""?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I screamed at the last part!üòÇüòÇüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"more dumb teenagers and adults being killed, i like some of the halloween movies but i hate how theres no diversity with the civilians, they‚Äôre all dumb and are always like ‚Äúmichael myers isnt real lol‚Äù smh so dumb lol still gonna watch it"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sweet!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve been waiting all this time for another Halloween movie #Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Boogie man is back to take his rightful place in the throne as the king of terror.
ek1ePFp-nBI,at 2:36 why is he holding the knife like that lol he should be holding it so the knife is coming out the bottom of his fist
ek1ePFp-nBI,and the school they filmed with the red and white floor is military magnet or charleston ! my school! i feel good about this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If you like horror movies:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25K2aTTgsOA"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yassss queen I have been waiting I wish laure would come pick me up to night so we can go kill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers looks perfect.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am 11 and I have watched all the movies I need to see this one !
ek1ePFp-nBI,"wait, so is this movie saying that all the sequels that came out after the original are irrelevant and didn't happen?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love that Jamie Lee Curtis is allowing herself to age naturally; an exquisitely beautiful woman.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So it‚Äôs a sequel to the first movie, but couldn‚Äôt it also be a sequel to the second movie. Like they took place in the same night, and I guess he doesn‚Äôt have burn scars but they already present him as a force of human nature so.. is this really 2, or is it 3?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hey, I‚Äôm excited"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Why would Laurie be using a 22 rifle to protect against a guy who took 6 shots at point blank range* ??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like crap to me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Here before 100k viewsüíØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,AND THE FACT THAT THEY FILMED THIS IN MY TOWN DOWN THE STREETü§ó I FEEL HONORED
ek1ePFp-nBI,Happy happy Halloween silver shamrock now watch watch the magic pumpkin üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,so i guess they altered the ending to the original to him getting committed instead of disappearing after bein shot out a balcony
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks fucking amazing! We waited 7 years for a new Halloween movie and I‚Äôm ready!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully this starts the comeback of the true slasher series üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yea!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The shape has returned! The mask looks awesome and aged üíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Eh, doesn‚Äôt look too good but also not too bad. I don‚Äôt like that Laurie Strode appears to be something of a fearless action hero. I definitely like the idea that she‚Äôs been preparing for the day that the Boogie Man would Return, but she looks too eager to face off with him rather than reluctant. Regardless, I‚Äôm going to go watch it when it releases. Despite nothing but lackluster sequels, I still consider Halloween to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made and Michael Meyers one of the greatest horror film villains."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now that was a great trailer, but if they‚Äôre ignoring all of the sequels that followed, then how is it discovered that Laurie isn‚Äôt Michael‚Äôs sister. They do make a reference in this trailer to the 1981 sequel Halloween II. When the teens are talking about Michael being Laurie‚Äôs brother was only a rumor that was only revealed in the sequel. Unless the rumor was started after the events of the original Halloween. Either way this looks phenomenal. I still love Halloween II, and Halloween III: Season of the Witch, which to me are still solid sequels."
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Will This Release In India* ? üòå
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just take all the insane people and put them on one bus what could possibly go wrong.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The hype is reaaaaaaaaaaaaal
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is a demon
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMGGGGGGGG YESSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this true?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yep a disaster ,,sequel"" already"
ek1ePFp-nBI,bruh gonna spam space bar on this shit so i can finally hit my decisive strike for once goddammit
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be totally wicked
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm definitely gonna watch it
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am kinda confused with the Halloween timeline so which movie does this take after ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Welp let‚Äôs expect a Halloween Horror Nights Maze this year
ek1ePFp-nBI,I need these new looks in DbD please. <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,207 dislikes is just uncool. Screw all you dislikers. All of you who disliked this video can reply to me.
ek1ePFp-nBI,No Danielle Harris but it might be good. Wish Danielle was in it tho.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg!!! its Torstein from Vikings ffs
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Lol, the shotgun""s recoil is so unrealastic"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I already see a few plot holes if this is supposed to be a sequel to the first Halloween. First how did Michael get healed from those 6 gunshots he just took in the first one, he disappeared and is now in an institute in the trailer? Who captured Michael or how'd he end up in there? How old is Michael by now if this if 40 years from the original( old man now)?  Regardless of what it's labeled as, it looks like another poor excuse to market Michael Myers and Halloween to try one more cash grab. Some people are satisfied with original content and old stories, no need to try a remake, a prequel, or a second, second sequel as this one is. This is not the real sequel to the original Halloween!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now we need a new Jason movie lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Straight to Netflix
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wasn‚Äôt necessarily overly thrilled by the idea of this movie, but cannot lie about the definite thrills while watching the trailer"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG I can't wait!!!!üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:27
Girl Pushing the door
Michael: Ouch
A girl keep pushing the door 
Michael: BeGone Thot"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Since when has Latex mask aged?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they have Mikey killing naked bitches üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüç∫üëªüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,I fucking love Blumhouse. They're remaking classic slasher now is dope af. I hope to see a Freddy or Jason movie by these people!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it‚Äôs Halloween H40? üôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'M SO EXCITED WTF
ek1ePFp-nBI,Seriously? He‚Äôs not her brother? Wtf! This is some bull shit! I‚Äôm still gonna watch though. Just kinda pisses me off
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I don't really like sequels to classic horror movies, they tend to be very repetitive. Just see Saw, Friday the 13th, Nightmare or even Halloween. But this looks pretty good. I'm interested. Also the line ""It's not her brother, that's just something people made up"" made me chuckle"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don‚Äôt tell me he gonna be running again lmao. Last two sucked. Jokes aside this looks fire üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,When i were young i have watch this and i know ending of this movie i should not reveal it but when u want u can watch on youtube lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lol it has been the week of the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, what looks to be a good sequel.  Younger people and millenials I don‚Äôt think will get this movie and should stay away with their dumb comments.  This should be a movie to be appreciated by people about age 40 and OLDER.  This movie was made for us.  Very excited."
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG THIS LOOKS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally !  (the rock voice)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Micheal was like bitch I don't know why you keep trying shut the door on me knowing damn well I'm trying Kill you üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to watch this. My favorite horror franchise + Danny McBride doing the screenplay. Come on
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Make Michel look scary and awesome check
Make Lorie a badass check 
Hype people up check"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is where you tell Rob Zombie, take notes on how its really done."
ek1ePFp-nBI,it seems like theyre trying to make it like the original. i think its gonna be an alright movie. but idk.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is back the real Michael Myers is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really very disappointed with this. Looks inauthentic
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it's a sequel to the original... yet it's titled the exact same... genius
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait to see an elderly woman battle Michael Myers! It's gonna be so LIT!
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween H4O
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the Joker film we deserved
ek1ePFp-nBI,Kind of seems like a cheap story. Doesnt make much sense.
ek1ePFp-nBI,That new Michael Myers mask is freaking scarier than the original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,But why take away his immortality in this? That's the main thing that made him scary knowing that he will never die!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So she decided to do this instead of Freaky Friday 2?? okay...
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Halloween Will Be Epic Just Watching The Trailer Reminds Me Of The Very First One I Can't Wait To See This
ek1ePFp-nBI,Waits so does halloween 2 and the rest of them not exist in this timeline I'm confused.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My one question is, how did they catch him and put him back in prison?¬† Other than that I can't for this, I love the original and this looks like a good follow up to that."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait until October!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,they really mastered the old school vibe mixed with new school this looks amazing and the strode girls are gonna give the fans exactly what we love to see in a final girl. can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finalmente! ‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,Chiils all over
ek1ePFp-nBI,DANNY !!YOU DID IT!!! AWESOME!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Come on October!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yea dey bought the old mask back üí™üèΩüí™üèΩ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks very good. But if you are going to ignore the sequels, especially part 2, why have Laurie Strode at all? If Michael isn‚Äôt related to her, why would she be so obsessed with him 40 years later? Why would the mental hospital allow the British dude to show Michael the mask. ‚ÄúHey, you want to show Michael a mask that could trigger a psychotic reaction? Sure thing!‚Äù. I love part 2 and will always consider it the true sequel. I also like 4 & 5 a lot. It went off the rails after 5 though. I wonder why they never pursued having Jamie become a killer. Would of been interesting to see an unstoppable female killing machine."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love the old school vibe üëåüëçüèΩüéÉüó°
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh just drop it now!!!! No need to promote it just drop it I want to watch it soooooo bad.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Uncle Mickey's back!!! üî™üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,–û—É—É—É –¥–∞–∞–∞–∞!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yet this movie doesn‚Äôt line up with H20 being the most recent in the series where Jamies slices his head off at the end.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Return of a Legend. üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,My body is ready.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""This thing that lived inside of him came from a source too violent, too deadly for you to imagine....it grew inside him contaminating his soul, it was.....PURE EVIL"" -Dr. Loomis"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last shot tho üò± counting the days till release
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm super happy the decided to make it a direct sequel of the original.... like, you have no idea."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought jamie lee curits was done after h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh i cant wait..looks sooo good hope it is..
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CANT WAIT. THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS üî•üî•üò©üò©ü§óü§ó
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Laurie has a daughter? 







But what happened to john(laurie‚Äôs son)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG words can't describe how epic this looks I am beyond pumped.
ek1ePFp-nBI,freaking YES!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why aren‚Äôt more people seeing this trailer ahhhhhhhhh!
ek1ePFp-nBI,HE'LL YEA HALLOWEEN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes omg im soooo excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"At the end of Halloween Michael falls out the window after being shot six times, Laurie and Loomis peer out to see he has got up and is still on the loose, he could have gone anywhere, that's scary right? This film seems to rid of that to have him back in a facility? Okay, I guess."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,thank god blumhouse got the rights from bob zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,Come on where's my beer!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so fucking excited!!!!! & it‚Äôs perfect timing for its release on my birthday weekend‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSS FUCKIN FINALLY!!!!!! üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh BOI
ek1ePFp-nBI,I didn‚Äôt know Michael carries around human teeth wherever he goes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*""The Legend Is BacküéÉ""*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so fucking glad this movie was exactly what I've been waiting for in halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow, this actually looks really good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"makes no sense thought he was dead, this movie is going too bomb"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"People are saying he only killed 3 people, but technically he was already famous remember? Then he escapes and is shot by his own psychiatrist after killing 3 more people?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,S√≥ em ver j√° fico com cora√ß√£o palpitando imagina assistindo nossa n vejo a hora
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look better than rob zombie garbage
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fucking chills... I never thought I'd ever see a new halloween movie trailer!  And when the theme played... OMG!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,ü§Ø
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this actually looks better than a majority of the other Halloween movies LOL.
ek1ePFp-nBI,EITA PORRA!!! AGORA SIM DEU VONTADE DE IR NO CINEMA! ‚ô•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's cool as hell that they are still making movies in this series 40 yrs. after the original. Fans like myself love it. Michael looks great and cast looks good but idk if i care for the ""Home Alone vibe"" with the hidden doors in the floor. Also kind of odd Laurie spent so many years preparing for something that might have never happened. Who's to say Michael returns especially since they removed their whole being related aspect? Still my butt will be in the theaters for this one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait but I swear he escaped at the end of the first movie not arrested
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding; even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face and, the blackest eyes... the *devil's* eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... *evil*."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are those his own teeth!?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is everything I needed, today. October can not come soon enough!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is someone gonna call John Wick at some point during the movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This comes out on my birthday!
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this like a back story like a prelude?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this actually doesn't look bad at all.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Easter egg: the kids running when laurie gets out of the truck r wearing the cosutumes from Halloween 5
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Robie Zombie, please dont come back with another crap."
ek1ePFp-nBI,People with constipation should watch this!!üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,is this the same trailer they showed at cinemacon in april?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Do you believe in the boogeyman? You do now
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dope they brought back Jamie Lee Curtis for this one. Looking forward to it
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So pumped to see this can‚Äôt wait to see this in theaters , I‚Äôve watched all the movies as a kid and now I can finally see Michael Myers on the big screen in one of his best movies yet , this looks sick , the mask , the blood plus the blumhouse effect with how it looks , this is going to be one for the ages ! Long live Halloween!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How the Hell is she alive when she got killed by Michael in Earlier movies lol!?! I can't ignore that or am I slow and it never happened?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really beating this dead horse huh? Fuck it I'm probably still gonna watch it. üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:36 
SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER"
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should just make a Michael Myers multiverse and add the Rob zombie Mikey myers in on this bitch.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HYPE!!!!!!!!!!!!FUCK YES!!!!!!!üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am calling it the British guy is Micheal in disguise, just like Friday 13th part V.  Err probably not."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is deadshot
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rite now I‚Äôm so fucking excited for this movie Jamie lee did üòä the dame thing in this movie !!! Can‚Äôt to go see this movie when it comes out !!üëèüèæüëèüèæüôåüèæüëåüèæüòèü§™‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween just turned into Texas Chainsaw

Texas Chainsaw (2013) is officially the 2nd Movie of the series while Halloween (2018) is officially the 4th Movie of the Series. The right order is 1, 2, , 7, 11"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gonna be bad ass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuckin yassss! I think my wiener just grew 6 inches!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The first one was more scarier 2018 movies suck d!ck
ek1ePFp-nBI,laurie is such a badass in this one holy fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,Always British documentary people lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"to brief anyone that doesn't know, this is a sequel to the FIRST Halloween Film, this film ignores everything that happened in Halloweens 2 through 8, meaning they don't exist in this movies continuity. just clearin' this up."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So we‚Äôre all gonna go with Jamie lee Curtis being the only smart one
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg u can't wait for this!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In my opinion, the film's biggest asset is Jamie Lee and the music. It's biggest apparent weakness is a possible attempt to modernize Halloween, which has already been attempted by Rob Zombie and clearly failed. If the cast's goal is to remain true to the original Halloween film -- which the cast has stated several times --  then cold camera filters reminiscent of ""Saw"" (like the one used in the bathroom scene) and unnecessary gory motifs (dropping teeth paired with cheesy acting) have no place in this film. I am supportive of their attempt to re-ignite this franchise, but there have been over ten terrible Halloween films since the 1978 original. And I am not interested in seeing any more, especially after Rob Zombie's modern adaptations."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers , the all time Great is back! Who else is hyped as hell?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The night he came back home
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by Daylight has prepared me to face the shape.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:52 start from there
ek1ePFp-nBI,I adMyer these movies hahaha... No? Okay.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Doesen't matter how fast you run
Michael Myers walks faster"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,YES YES YES YES YES LORI!!!!  MIIIIICHEAL!!!!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks promising! Excited for this movie!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now all we need is Freddy and Jason back.......
ek1ePFp-nBI,":58-1:00

Thought I heard the Jurassic Park theme. Was expecting dinosaurs. lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, we‚Äôre just going to ignore the fact she died on Halloween Resurrection?...Cool"
ek1ePFp-nBI,y‚Äôall seriously just gonna name this movie ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù again. We fucking got 3 films just named halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awwww mannn it's been too long with a halloween movie now its here
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this is basically the new Halloween 2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't know how I feel about this
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please don't show his face or let him talk!
ek1ePFp-nBI,he was arrested after stabbing teenagers in 1976 and 78 and 81 and 82 and 88 and 89 and 95 and 98 and 2002
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hollywood ki bharti Alag hi
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have a feeling this could be the ""IT"" of 2018. Completely outperforms everyones expectations and dominates the box office. Halloween 2018 could give Michael Myers a much deserved resurgence into present day. Just wait, you'll start to see more and more people dressing up as him. ICONIC."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who think Michael will die in this movie. Either Michael or Laurie
ek1ePFp-nBI,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0h9wiTptj58
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'M SO EXCITED
ek1ePFp-nBI,ARGH! I am SOOO friggin' excited. I can't wait. Looks awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone try to make a timeline of all the haliween movies (Not including the reboot and its sequal)
ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogeyman is coming
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thoughts

beginning of teaser: oh boy, another crappy reboot
end of teaser: WHY CANT I SEE THIS NOW"
ek1ePFp-nBI,And Michael is back one last time
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This makes no sense. How are they going to explain Jamie Lee Curtis getting killed and thrown from the building. Or are they simply just forgetting all that and this is some kind of time paradox!

Death of Jamie Lee Curtis
https://youtu.be/JHs6F6W1Vgk"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, how did he end up getting caught for 40 years if this movie is just continuing after the first one where he got away??

Anyway, this is gonna be üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•!
I can't wait!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Imagine Jami Lee Curtis & Scout Taylor Compton in one Halloween movie tho... would‚Äôve been a great mentor-student moment
ek1ePFp-nBI,can't wait for this!! anyone who dislikes this ain't nothing but trolls.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nice edit
ek1ePFp-nBI,My pants are down. Now what?
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so fucking stupid. For the lack of better terms it's stupid to ignore all of these sequels and make this movie with an entirely new rebooted plot. This movie didn't need to be made.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh
ek1ePFp-nBI,How is lori strode alive when michael killed her in h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That WC scene dude....
Hype too see this goddamn classic again  and see Carpenter work influence this new generation of horror to some folks."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Danielle Harris at least has a cameo üôèüèºüôèüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,So does this mean that there is gonna be a new Friday th 13th as well this year?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't look scary at all but I'm glad they remade it again cause rob single handidly ruined the franchise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why wouldn‚Äôt she turn off the closet light before closing the door? That ruined the whole trailer for me. I want my money back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:16 so I can ill him
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot WAIT MMMMM
ek1ePFp-nBI,What really fuck me up it's they are no longer brothers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,lit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,:)
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSS AWESOMEEE
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuckin crazy idk if ill be watchin this
ek1ePFp-nBI,khtrnak üòµüëª
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG I can't wait to see this movie Michael Myers is back and better than ever before.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"20 years I‚Äôve waited for a decent Halloween film. H20 was good. Since then, nada"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëåüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The best trailer ever to exist in modern times
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes I can‚Äôt wait for it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Excited!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I should not watch this trailer he shows too much...
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH....MY.....GOD!!!!!!! It's gonna KILL üî™üî™üî™üî™ me to wait until October!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Woooooooo Halloween n shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hmmm, on the fence about this. I want to get excited for it but the trailer really didn't shock me or look that terrifying. I'm still going to go see it, I love the Halloween films. Just have to wait and see. More often than not, I am wrong, so I hope that this movie is awesome. :)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear this better be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks great! Everyone be positive because no Halloween movie could be worse then Resurrection.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Interesting...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wish Donald Pleasence was still around to play doctor Loomis him and Michael Myers made Halloween such a great movie imo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have so many mixed feelings...... but I‚Äôm still excited... I also wish they would‚Äôve came up with a different title... you can‚Äôt have a sequel have the same name as the original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's nice to listen to the Halloween music again. Definitely gonna check this one out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michale myers back again!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Omg, it looks Amazing! Ahhh!!! üéÉüî™üéÉüî™üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm not sure I like this. I think they could've at least left Halloween II canon. üòí
ek1ePFp-nBI,are you ready for...  DEBADELA
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The god damn bus or ambulance always crashes freeing Michael Myers üòê
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maximun security prison for kill 3 peoples? I don't know i would like to at least they  keep with his long killcount.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's hope it's good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fantastic!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jump scare slasher movie. Gayyyyyyyy!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"One thing I love about Halloween is we don't get one every year that does get old fast. At least they are spaced out. It does kinda suck they are ignoring the other movies now but they are still giving them a nod: they make that music when he bumps into the kids, he still ""teleports"" still has his creepy walk. I don't buy Laurie being fearless now. I understand that want her to play the role Loomis did as ""shape Hunter"" but I loved how H20 did it, she was jumping at shadows and that was tense. Erasing the brother connection is interesting but changes thier odd relationship to. This does look awsome though. Welcome back Myers and Laurie it's been a looong time"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The sheer silence when the mask is pulled out is soo chilling
ek1ePFp-nBI,One down 3 more
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next time I buy a closet I want a killer with it
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its look interesting
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'll wait for the bootleg
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Kinda split on this, not sure if I like this or not, I just hope they don't mess it up. If anything if it is bad I'll just act like it never happened !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I caught about 3 references to previous Halloween movies not to mention the conversation about him being her brother from Halloween II.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I knew they would ruin halloween, michael and laurie aren't related now? And only the original halloween happened? WTF! They just ruined a classic franchise that surpasses all other slashers with this crap. Extremely disappointed"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why isn't this on trending???
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg..look awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,I WANNA BE LIKE MIKE!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ahhhhhhhhhh sssshhhhhheeeeeeiiiiittttttttt heeeeesssss BACK!
ek1ePFp-nBI,No halloween without michael myers..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Very very excited about this.  With that said.  In my opinion with how this one is starting,  they could have left off after the Halloween 2.  Instead of the first one.  Michael at the end of 2 catches on fire and falls on the street and they could have arrested him there."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Honestly... disappointed
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike and Jay from we watched a movie.wherever you are I know your watching this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"David Gordon Green?
Is it a comedy?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,....i guess :v
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is it a sequel or a reboot?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many good fucking trailer came out this week
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing.  Huge Halloween fan and this looks the best of the lot.  I like how it nods to H20 H4  and H1 plus Rob Zombies remake.  I can't wait for October.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I KNOW WHAT I'M WATCHING THIS HALLOWEEN!!!!! #HALLOWEEN2018!!!!  #MICHAELRETURNS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Would have made sense if the timeline was Halloween 1 and 2, H20, then Halloween 2018....and ignoring the events of resurrection"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Daddy myers is back !
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think i just squirttttt
ek1ePFp-nBI,pretty upset with this trailer for the film. i honestly had extremely high hopes for it but they changed the story line yet again in this one. why can't they stay true to the fucking original? what's so hard about that. anywho it must be because I'm a hardcore fan that I'm this critical.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie get that ass.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"üî•üî•üî•üî•, love it!!! Michael is back!!! This movie is going to be so lit and awesome!! The Night He Came Home! Legendary!Michael Myers is a Legend!! Let's get it Michael Myers!! Hopefully, Michael Myers doesn't die."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Was this a true story?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pretty sure this will end with it all being in Laurie's head or something and she's the real killer...but I'll watch.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuuuuuck I'm cuummming!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lmao I died when she said can we close the door and this man just comes out like what are you doing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Absolutely positively incredible. Blumhouse, along with everyone else involved, has truly recreated perfection. You have made many horror fans happy today :) üî™üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Loved it. It's seems much better than previous squeals.
ek1ePFp-nBI,WOW! Just WOW!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't look as good as the Rob Zombie reboot. COME AT ME!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween H2020
ek1ePFp-nBI,So is this sort of a Halloween 2 remake? Reboot? Rehash?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks really good!
ek1ePFp-nBI,By far one of the best horror movie trailers in 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,Love the rob zombie versions more than the originals.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Got chills when that song came on
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't wait :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just hope that there will not be any SJW crap
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequel to the 2007/2009 Halloween‚Äôs?
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie looks like crap.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dear god that ending was fucking laughable. Should‚Äôve cut it from the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Man, that Chris Pine mask hasn‚Äôt aged a day. Looking forward to this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blume house.............why? Why is this a blume house thing? Why do modern movies look so UNcinematic?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's hope this film will scare the SHIT out of us (truth is it will) and let's us hope that this film is 100 times better than ANNIHILATION.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Keep both eyes open when firing a firearm.
Fcking Hollywood."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The OG scream queen has arrived
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay. Let me start off by saying that I like this trailer and I‚Äôm excited to see it in October, but I have a ton of questions. First off, the guy said that he was in prison for 40 years. But he‚Äôs escaped from Smith‚Äôs Grove almost 3 times already, that was over 25 to 30 years ago. So what happened to the last 6 movies? Did they never exist, or were those ones just an alternate timeline? And second of all, what the fuck are these kids talking about, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not Laurie‚Äôs brother?‚Äù Did the sanitarium still cover that up? Everyone knows that Myers is her older brother so what the fuck is going on here?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween 2018:

THE SAME FUCKING SHIT.

Micheal escapes, Laurie Strode is caught up in it, rinse, repeat.

Lemme tell all yall how its gonna end IF IT ENDS - Micheal Myers will only die once Laurie Strode is dead. If that doesn't happen, there will just be another Halloween movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Takes place in an alternate dimension.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god that last scene is from my nightmares
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who is the old lady that tried to kill him?
ek1ePFp-nBI,damn. high hopes for this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG
ek1ePFp-nBI,Quem gostou d√° um like üò±üëèüèªüëèüèª
ek1ePFp-nBI,HERE IT IS FINALLY!!!!!! WE'VE ALL WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED FOR THIS DAY/TRAILER..... IT'S FINALLY HERE.... CAN'T WAIT!!!! BY FAR MICHAEL MYERS HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE HORROR FIGURE/MOVIES..... THANK GOD THIS WON'T BE A SHITTY REMAKE LIKE THE LAST FEW (NOT COUNTING ROB ZOMBIE VERSION THAT WASN'T BAD)....
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Praise the Lord that the fad of R&B singers, WB Teen Stars and Kevin Williamson dialogues is beyond dead...."
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHY NOT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pure feces
ek1ePFp-nBI,This whole sting before a trailer has got to stop
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks good looks like they caught the feel of the original i can't wait to see it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Activia should do some product placement for this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,BITCH YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO!
ek1ePFp-nBI,poor
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks pretty SHIT

ek1ePFp-nBI,Good to see they are trying to repair the franchise after Rob Zombie pissed all over it. jesus christ.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn this looks epic!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok, it looks promising, but is this like a reboot to a sequel?  I mean, wasn't H20 mostly the same concept?  Sure, it's different cause Laurie has been preparing to kill him instead of being outright frightened this whole time.  I really hope they make it different enough.  I guess you will have two versions of the ""decades later"" concept, in the one where Laurie is very much suffering and frightened daily after the events, or where she as been militantly preparing for revenge.  You can pick the one you like best!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse is the new infinitive horror movie FRANCHISE...PEEP HOW THE MAN & WOMAN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE TRAILER ARE FROM THE CONJURING...WOW
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is just some fucking old bitch by now. Like calm tf down before you pull a back muscle
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so fucking pumped
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like H2O meets RZ Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stupid fucking psychopaths !!!! I WISH YOU ALL DEAD ALREADY !!! üëøüëøüíÄüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome!  I just wish they weren‚Äôt calling it ‚ÄúHalloween‚Äù.  It‚Äôs technically a sequel.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Mike Myers is Micheal Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like this concept of a reboot sequel. It really looks like we may get a return to vibe of the original. Laurie is out for revenge.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 He's Baccccccccccccccccck
ek1ePFp-nBI,did laurie not die in the last halloween movie???
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No thanks. Who did this, Joss Whedon? It looks like a failed pilot for the CW/WB."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I literally got chills when the music started. Let‚Äôs hope the movie is as good as the trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Blumhouse Making Horror Great Again.
ek1ePFp-nBI,If John Carpenter is involved I'm in.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Aww yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else would prefer if Hollywood would quit it with the remakes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes, fucking yes"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"More of the same. slow motion chases while he is walking, a big knife and Jamie Lee Curtis."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeahh can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fucking Michael, he always catch me off guard in Dead By Daylight"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YEAH BABY, YEAH!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"See you again on Halloween, Michael! üéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,the knife twirl is a nice touch!
ek1ePFp-nBI,yass gawd is right
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,Let's hope this movie isn't Doodoo like rob zombie's cheap reboots.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""....purely and simply evil.""

Micheal myers doesn't need reason, or an explanation why he will continue to chase ""the one that got away"" he is just a simply psychotic killer. 

cant wait for the movie! Halloween 2018 FTW."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""But you won't see my face, even in the trailer"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,so fucking hyped
ek1ePFp-nBI,ITS BEEN 40 years THAT LONG TO MAKE ONE MORE AGAIN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael would be 61 years old.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally... a flick I am excited about after the trailer... hope it doesn‚Äôt disappoint...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn..Blumhouse is on fire
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, One Of The Greatest Classics Horror  Movies To Ever Return, Seeing Them When It 1st Comes Out"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"The hype¬†for this film will be¬†the real killer this Halloween not Michael imo. Looks clich√© desperate and nothing we haven't seen 10,000 times but I guess because it's John and Jamie¬†that makes a difference."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks good... surprisingly.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie's gonna be really intense I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,It better be fucking good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween. The sequel to Halloween. This Halloween.
ek1ePFp-nBI,That actor seems so familiar. Wasn't he the guy who betrayed Jon Arryn and get killed at the tournament by the Mountain in season 1 of Game of Thrones? lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is going to go down in history just as the first one did. 40 years from now this movie will be iconic üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I understand the choice to have it a sequel to the first and not have Michael be related BUT I struggle a bit to find Laurie's motivation to be prepared for his return. Really in the first film she barely has interaction with Michael, summed up to be about 30 mins being persued by a man in a Mask only to be shot and disappear. If its been 40 years I don't know how committed she would have been to this cause and be ready for an unknown stranger that attacked her on Halloween Night

At the very least, if they kept the relationship cannon, she'd know that Michael is always thinking of his sister, that there may be a chance he'll come for her, that drove her motivation in H2O always knowing he could be there and always having to look over her shoulder, that gave H2O its charm, the eerie notion that my brother is going to come for me, to remove that and it be just a stranger...hmmm I struggle a bit I have to admit.

Then I thought well if it was a sequel to Halloween 2, atleast Michael's determination would have been there to keep coming for his sister, the only work around to that would be the burning of Michael's body at the end but really they could have retreaded Halloween 4's beginning with him being transported.

I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what they''re going to do with this one, again Laurie's obsession for preparing for Michael at least from the trailer end of it seems a bit of a stretch, the audience knows what the characters have been through in the 7 movies or so BUT this is a woman readying herself not really so that she's never scared and attacked by someone again but specifically for one man that tried to kill her one time when she was a teenager, kinda wish for that reason this was a sequel to H2O and not to just the first film, then we would have established Laurie's drive and what lengths she'll go through"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i just dont understand why they're ignoring Halloween 2, i mean i understand ignoring H20 and Resurrection, but yeah makes no sense. kinda dumb, still looking forward to this one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,U son of a bitch
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm speechless. This series means the world to me. In the words of Ru Paul, Don't fuck it up!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't act as if Halloween 3 didn't happened. I saw it. It cannot be erased.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HYYYYPE
ek1ePFp-nBI,Now we need Jason back too !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The legend. The icon. The Shape.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yep, I'll be in theatres DAY ONE!!! Feels like Michael Myers is back to his good old scary roots: an unknown being with no motivation whatsoever. Maybe this time it's a bit more ""unfinished business"" but it's nice to know it's not ""family matters"" anymore. It was okay, but it took away the essence of Michael: mystery, creepiness, horror and overall scariness.

On another note: the mask looks like it ""aged"" rather than ""decayed"", which is an extra creepy point. I hope they don't explain why (and since Mr. Carpenter is executive producing, I'm pretty sure he made sure the mystery would be intact).

Feeling like October yet?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I prayed for a friday the 13th movie 
Hollywood gave me this...close enough"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hello from Dead by Daylight by the way.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well...that looks alright.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sick
ek1ePFp-nBI,Greatest. Trailer. Ever. And I mean that!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who's closet has a light in it? This is fake news.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael is back, omg finally Michael and Laurie having a true battle, resurrection pissed me off for obvious reasons, cannot wait to see this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So michael Myers isnt Laurie's brother?

Why is Conor McGregor playing samuel loomis?

TF is going on"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg my childhood is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is suppose to carry on after the 2nd film..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Time to call...JOHN WICK
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚ÄúWas that the Boogeyman?‚Äù
‚ÄúAs a matter of fact, it was.‚Äù
#Halloween2018"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Eu amo o Michael Myers mas como o trailer contou praticamente o filme todo n√£o pareceu um filme muito bom.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Don't you hate it when you're trying to take a sh*t and someone gives you extra teeth?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think Michael has killed more people in public restrooms than anyone else in history!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i give this trailer a kitchen knife out of william shatner!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks like a Rob Zombie remake, in other words, it looks terrible. You cannot erase the ending of the 1st film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The first Halloween film to be released in October since Halloween 5 the revenge of Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS GONNA BE LEGENDARY!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CSNT FUCKING WAIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Wasn't it her brother who murdered all those babysitters?""

""No. That was not her brother, that was something people made up""

As a fan. That made me laugh"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I knew that hell would not have him
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh I‚Äôm so hyped that I just a bunch of random chores üòÇ LIKE ITS HAPPENING
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't understand I have read so many comments people knocking this already why is Michael throwing teeth over the bathroom stall door that's not what Michael does he stalks people he mocks them blah blah blah yes it's true but don't read too much into it guys it's Halloween and I think this is going to be the best Halloween since part 1 and 2 if you guys are huge Halloween fans then I guarantee we will all be satisfied don't read too much into it chill the fuck out
ek1ePFp-nBI,They actually got the mask pretty accurate
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSS!
ek1ePFp-nBI,not this shit again let it die
ek1ePFp-nBI,Won't beat the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAEL MYERS IS BACK!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks promising enough
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like theres gonna be a scene where a police/strode shoots a prankster
ek1ePFp-nBI,I waited soo long for this movie. I heard it was release on the Radio while i was driving my car home. Let's just say i ran every red light ;)
ek1ePFp-nBI,My heart is so filled with joy for horror üòÇ the king of horror is back üòàüî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM SO HAPPY üò≠üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just. Awesome!!! üî™ü§òüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,Some things about this seem really stupid. But better than i was expecting (Which still isn't all that much)
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should get Mike Myers to be Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so excited for this. Halloween has always been my favorite horror franchise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:41 WTF was thatüòâü§©
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Badass
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So we now have to ignore halloween 2, H20 and resurrection because they didn't happen. Abit daft."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm hard af right now

ek1ePFp-nBI,That guy holding the Micheal mask is loomises son...I'm calling it..that's why he's so upset and is copycating micheals murders.untill the end the real Micheal will appear and murder that dude
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks better than I could have hoped.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Gotta hate that blatant ""that was just a story they made up"" (AKA ""recent movies aren't Canon, Mr viewer"")"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many references to the franchise!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I had such high hopes for this, and they've just been dashed. Like a broken record, I think I'm going to skip this one. R.I.P. Michael Myers"
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well how about that? HEY DISNEY....THERE IS A SOLUTION TO YOUR  PROBLEM, LOL!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,A living legned back on the big screen
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm just relieved that talentless hack Rob Zombie was kept VERY far away from this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet Halloween horror nights is gonna do a haunted house for the new movie for Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM DIGGING THIS FUCKING TRAILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Teeth moment was kinda cool and creative, but the rest looked like generic slasher from early 00s. Not what I expected("
ek1ePFp-nBI,not the same actor for Michael Meyer ? And not rob zombi..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ok not hating. This looks good, but what‚Äôs the scare factor? Also is he super human/natural or something? Why doesn‚Äôt anyone just shoot him dead?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer looks awesommmeee. Can't wait for the movie. Michael is coming üíÄüíÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow. This looks awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,hope this year goes down as best trailers so many damn trailers this week
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow! The closet scene at the end is the best part!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Not going to lie I was expecting a different tone. Doesn‚Äôt feel like the old school Halloween Films. I‚Äôll give it a try I guess
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is one of the worst examples I've ever seen of a trailer giving away too much.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The end made me cry
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:07 has a reference to Halloween 3 season of the witch. There are two kids that are wearing the witch and skeleton mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh YEAH, i'm there"
ek1ePFp-nBI,omg this looks freaking awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMFG THE AMOUNT Of GOOSEBUMPS I got
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Wasn't it her brother who murdered all those babysitters?""

""No that was a stupid plot point made in the sequel. This is a reboot. Only the first film is canon now.""

""I also heard about this Curse of Thorn involving druids...""

""STFU"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,Alright. I can't help it. I'm looking forward to this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is going to be TOTALLY awesome! I really can't wait to see it, it's going to be the centre of this years Halloween festivities for so many of us üéÉüî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanna embrace everyone here as my kind of people. I love you all. :) can‚Äôt wait for us all to see this
ek1ePFp-nBI,O yeah baby!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This week is full with movie trailers and I might see all of them best week ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,You guys have made me happy. I never thought we would get another shot at seeing a decent Halloween movie again. This trailer has BLOWN my expectations in a very good way. THANK YOU!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last spoiler didn't need to be spoiled. Juss sayin...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If they keep it non-gory like the original,  I might be interested."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should‚Äôve been released in halloween instead of Summer smh
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wow. Props to everyone involved for recognizing they didn't have to set this up as a typical horror movie. I love horror films - don't misunderstand - you just see that whenever doing a sequel or prequel, most creators think they have to make it feel identical to the existing property. This story requires a different vibe, and they allowed for this. Again, kudos."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Paused 1:48 you can see Michael face
ek1ePFp-nBI,I keep watching it but it won't show me more!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG The trailer alone terrified me!!! I can't wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,According to John Carpenter this takes place after 1 and 2 not just after the 1st
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so mad that he and Lori are not brother and sister because then it's like why would he even go after her. Like its just weird
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks amazing, it‚Äôs a whole different concept but it works"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Brandy love is that you?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Soo... Good...
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes fucking yes I've waited years for this movie!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"At the end I was like ""oh shit"" when the closet door opened"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks okay, better than the last ones."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks amazing! I‚Äôm legitimately glad they (seemingly) abandoned all the sequels, and how there‚Äôs no supernatural elements at all. A good, clean, slasher like Halloween was meant to be."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Okay this looks......fucking amazing. I hope we have a classic on our hands here fellas. This Michael mask looks great but the scariest mask still is from halloween 6 .
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks awesome !! So glad laurie is back !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael has finally come home ladies and gentlemen evil is here and it's going to tear shit up I can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,So this takes place after Halloween 1 40 years later?
ek1ePFp-nBI,BEYOND EXCITED!!! I got so many chills watching this. Once the music hit I'm like oh the feels. This is my favorite horror franchise and Michael Myers has always been my favorite slasher villain. One last time we'll see him go toe to toe against Laurie. This is going to be so good and the intensity is going to be on a whole nother level!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Brings Me Back to the GOOD Horror Days
ek1ePFp-nBI,Next big hit movie? ü§Ø
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is matured making i love hollywood flims
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not the biggest Halloween fan, I was intrigued by the prospect of a new film though. I wish it didn't sound the same two writers scripted every modern film, I'm not just talking about Halloween, I mean Hollywood films period. I also hate the fact that everything has to be made absolutely clear, no sense of mystery or wonder thus in turn, suspense.  Why not make an interesting entry which gets under people's skin and treats them as if they have a modicum of intelligence? Be if the creators were to take the series in an intriguing direction."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks like a parody of horror movies and having characters spew exposition in an unnartural dialect is just artificial especially in a marketing sense for your trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm in tears this looks absolutely incredible...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"A Proper acting Myers for a long, long time."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer is sooo good. I‚Äôm mad hyped for this movie. I‚Äôve been dying for another Halloween movie. Michael Myers is the best serial killer in its genre. May Halloween return for one last night of on a holy terror
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope there's a damn good explanation of how he got caught after being shot by Loomis at the end of the first one. Because he did get away after being shot and falling over the balcony.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Let's watch Halloween!""
""Which one?""
""The new one.""
""The remake?""
""The sequel.""
""Halloween 2? Nah, I hated all that hallucinating-his-mother stuff""
""No, the sequel to the original.""
""Oh! The one where you find out he's Laurie's brother?""
""No, the newest sequel!""
""...Resurrection? Christ, that was awful.""
""No! There's a new film that's a sequel to the original film and retcons all the others.""
""Oh, cool. What's it called?""
""Halloween.""
""No, what's the sequel called?""
""HALLOWEEN.""
""The sequel to Halloween is called Halloween?""
""Yes!""
""...""
""..."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite horror series
ek1ePFp-nBI,"YESSSSS, horror, ive found you again. I needed something like this since IT."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally Michael Myers Has Come Back To Halloween....
ek1ePFp-nBI,On man
ek1ePFp-nBI,When will it trend? ü§î
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuckk all how many times are they going to keep retelling the same story. #JakeHUnter88
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck to the yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That‚Äôs all I needed; Jamie and Michael, no stupid backstory. This looks great."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks so creepy!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael's an incel and he's pissed üòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequel to Halloween or a reworked version of H20? Isn‚Äôt the bathroom scene in H20?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This time, it's not a film by Dimension Films, but a film by Universal and Blumhouse. Great companies."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"By far 2018's best trailer! The boogeyman is back, and I'm so hyped!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs scary is he sure he‚Äôs not from dc u-verse
ek1ePFp-nBI,Littttttüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
ek1ePFp-nBI,"A Better Horror Film: Watching the Hollywood douche bag producers who made this first discussing, then finally agreeing, to wipe their collective backsides with memory of such an incredible original film, by 'rebooting' it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The best in the series is 1,2,4,6 for me, I dont mind that this is following on from the first and ignoring the rest just glad the boogeyman is back üî™üî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow. This looks great!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I do have to say David Gordon Green and Danny McBride did justice it looks with this movie. Looks pretty good to me. Danny and David I had a feeling they would pull it off and stay true to the original
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks good as fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy shit put it on 1080p and slow it down to half speed that head that slams into the bathroom stall is actually the British dude getting his head slammed into it by Michael at about @1:49
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh $HIT !!!!!!! :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Within the movie how is Micheal Myers back hes littery like a zombie that cant die
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""HALLOWEEN... THE NIGHT HE CAME HOME"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,How many times can they remake this?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The music is still hype for me
ek1ePFp-nBI,fuck mobies
ek1ePFp-nBI,This feels like an old school Halloween film!
ek1ePFp-nBI,All the Babysitters are sweating now....  Cannot wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*was anyone else hoping for a scene where they capture him in 1978? that would have been cool*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope Halloween II is the only sequel included in this timeline. That movie was too good to just be thrown out.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone know the age rating for the UK?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"–ù–µ—Ö–∏–ª–æ —Ç–∞–∫, —Å –ø–∏–≤–∫–æ–º –ø–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks so good hopefully it makes a shit ton of money so they start making other iconic slasher movies again like Friday the 13th and a nightmare on elm street etc.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have waited years for this, since I was a little kid"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It is possible that part 2 couldve been a dream from shock of the aftermath, and maybe being put under anesthesia after the end of part 1."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think I just shit my pants...
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm confused. I thought Jaime Lee Curtis's character died in a previous Halloween film?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael returns to finish some unfinished business!! üî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,He‚Äôs back! Looks pretty good. Though not a fan of the cinematography. Kinda blah. But I‚Äôm looking forward to it!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I would love to rewatch all Halloween movies before this! Yay!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is the best birthday gift I can't wait for October 19th
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mikey is back and scarier then ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,awesome!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,sigh
ek1ePFp-nBI,it looks just like it happen right after the first 2 it's awesome! !!! the respected everything about the originals! ! can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,that background music still scares the shit out of me
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie is a badass and Michael is a badass I just cant see either of them dying
ek1ePFp-nBI,A musiquinha chega arrepia os pelo do c#
ek1ePFp-nBI,They should call this one Hallloween: H4O - 40 Years Later. Lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers is the essence of Evil born into a human mold who has been sent out to induce pain he dares no regrets and no empathy Michael has something in his mind called: Evil WithinüéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wtff the michael took off all his teeth or something
ek1ePFp-nBI,Needs more Busta Rhymes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh yeah Micheal is back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If this film is great, the slasher genre is coming back!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait is this the third movie just called ""Halloween"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So it's H20 again. With several direct references to the original film. And Michael in plain sight, like, all the time.

Meh."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Death has come to your little town, sheriff."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ok koo so we gone act like she aint die in resurrection...sayless
ek1ePFp-nBI,For a 60 year old man Michael still has it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Good, no Dark Universe"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks fine but wtf? Too soon.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stooked!
ek1ePFp-nBI,yeah!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else think this sounds a bit like the COD Zombies sound track?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm so excited!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I need Jason Blum to continue reviving our horror classics and doing them justice. Give us a direct sequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as well as you can without Marilyn Burns. Give us 5cream starring Hayden Panettiere as Kirby considering she was the only one that survived so she's our new Sydney. Give us a new Chucky film that doesn't go straight to DVD. Give us a new Nightmare On Elm Street and idk maybe make Freddy........female. Casting a male already proved to be a failure because he will automatically be compared to Robert Englund so why not create a new narrative with a classic character. It would be brilliant. Blumhouse is the only studio I would let touch any horror classic in an attempt of a remake, reboot, or new sequel. They should've been the ones to do The Strangers Prey At Night. Give us what we deserve."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Somehow this 2 minute trailer cuts through 40 years of disappointment and has got me thrilled for October. I can't wait to be in that cinema hearing them screams.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks anazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like how Halloween 2 and all the other films including the remakes are being ignored. Because they sucked anyway. I like the idea of a direct sequel.

However what baffles is the original Halloween we are left to assume Michael is somewhere between the ages 18-25 in the original. 40 years later which means Michael would be pushing 50yrs old. What motives does he have to keep killing after being in a psychiatric hospital for 40yrs & he‚Äôs moving like a 20 yr old 

My early prediction is Michael is dead & this killer is a copy cat trying to finish the business Michael never did (Killing Laurie)

However that‚Äôs my opinion, well see how it plays out come October. I am so excited for this movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I remember back when trailers didn't need clips of the trailer to play right before the trailer to get you hyped for the trailer you're literally going to see in three seconds.
ek1ePFp-nBI,this can be absolute crap or absolute perfection... let's hope for perfection
ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogie man has returned
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Do you know that I pray every night that he would escape"".
""What the hell did you do that for??""
""So I could kill him""."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this looks pretty good actually
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks cool I suppose, but didn't he get burned alive? Could someone explain how this story works?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,comeback =)
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm so glad we came back full circle with this movie. Forget Rob Zombie, Forget  Ressurection and forget the Thorn trilogy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,One of the best horror villains ever I can't wait!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna make $600/$700 million
ek1ePFp-nBI,Massa demais
ek1ePFp-nBI,He is back ‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its about fucken time
ek1ePFp-nBI,The original slasher is back baby Micheal fukin myers!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that kid about to die cause we know that babysitter at the end of the trailer definitely died
ek1ePFp-nBI,I've got goosebumps!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis seems scary in this..
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt friggin wait!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The easiest Hollywood role to play, because all you gotta do is walk around with a knife, pretend to kill, not say anything and then get paid."
ek1ePFp-nBI,simply awesome!!!! Wow....Cant wait October 2018
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can‚Äôt wait for this.   The only Halloween I was old enough to see in theaters was resurrection and the two zombies‚Äô.Those were a disappointment. I think this is what Halloween fans have been waiting for!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whoooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The babysitter (Vicky,actress: Virginia Gardner) is dead. You blood on 2:22 min. :^^ (SPOILER)

Edit1: The blood in your arm."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Glad to see they didn‚Äôt let Rob Zombie anywhere NEAR this movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm sorry but the ""michaaaeel"" at 2:18 is so funny"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't love the original Halloween  but this was awesome!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,THANK GOD!!!! IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"at the end before Michael is about to kill Lorie, Busta Rhymes jumps out of no where and say, ""Trick or Treat, muthafucka!"" and then blows Michael's head off with shotgun"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HE'S BAAAACCCKKKKKK
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don‚Äôt understand why he would show him his mask knowing that‚Äôll trigger him all over again. How did he even get the mask in the first place? In the mean time I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie especially since it‚Äôs around the time of my birthday Halloween üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh, this looks so good. A worthy followup"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That walk seems awfully familiar. .....
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:00 nice homage to the originals
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is in the closet Confirmed.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met this 6 year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes; the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply‚Ä¶ evil."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks lame.What a let down. I hope the movie is better than this trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm really excited to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:29 The small reflection on the fridge looks like a knife being raised
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My birthday is on Halloween, and ever since I was a kid this movie has been a part of my life. I turn 42 this year, looking forward to this a nice gift."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Take my money!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Maybe they can create a Horror Cinematic Universe.
ek1ePFp-nBI,GOOOOO Myaers <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,"what i want to know is, what was the original attraction michael had to her, bc in the original the film clearly shows him stalking her? I can be okay with them not being related but what was his orignal attraction to her int he first place?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"H20 was closest we got to real sequel...this looks great....michael is a lurking, stalker type threat, keeps the suspense...see  another take on Jamie Lee calling him out, one of best parts in h20, she stops running from him"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Well, first of all
1. Michael looks badass
2. Creepin' me out
3. F**K YEAH!!!!!! BADASS BAD GUY!!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"classic horror movie song,I love it and I love this movie franchise too"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Also love how they acknowledge that Michael Myers is not Laurie Strode‚Äôs brother here. That‚Äôs quite clever
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bitch this looks amazing I‚Äôm deannsjdixivn
ek1ePFp-nBI,This better be rated R for gore and violence and scary scenes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Crosses fingers‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Please don‚Äôt be shit Please don‚Äôt be shit Please don‚Äôt be shit!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks legit
ek1ePFp-nBI,Lets goooo
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm fucking excited and HYPED. Is anyone else the same way?
ek1ePFp-nBI,1978 to 2018 wow can't wait to see it

ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes i am so excited‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,There‚Äôs some nice photography in the trailer and I‚Äôm very excited and intrigued to see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Wait, so is this taking place after Halloween 1, thus throwing out everything else?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,I bet rob zombie said ‚ÄúTHATS NOT WHAT HAPPENED‚Äù ‚ÄúTHATS NOT MY VISION‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good so far. We get it they aint related dont have to hammer the point
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie is gonna kick ass but ot makes no sense at all at the end of the original michael disspeared so how was he captured and they saying that he and Laurie are no long bro n sis thats bullshit then why would michael even want to kill het his purpose is to whipe out his blood line. We will see how they gonna put there spin on this
ek1ePFp-nBI,looks like I gotta buy my tickets early cause ik its gonna be sold out just like the new it movie was
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Very, very impressed. Clearly a lot of care and attention has gone into this movie - Feels like they want this to be the ultimate companion to the original. Hope this is indeed the final showdown."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Did anyone else notice the hole in Michael's neck where Laurie stabbed him in the original @2:22?
ek1ePFp-nBI,What if M. Night Shamalan directed this? What would be the Twist?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope it‚Äôs rated R
ek1ePFp-nBI,"To all my Indiana horror friends, let's all meet up at the theaters when it comes out in full Michael Myers costumes >:)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm a little annoyed they messed up the whole storyline from the rest of the franchise. Other than that, it looks sweet."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"this looks fucking amazing holy SHIT, my boy michael is back!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,i will make a second account just to like it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Please, just please let this be good. The slasher genre needs a good revival"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome... I'm so existed for this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
üéÉüî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael Myers has always been my fav slasher killer of all time, so happy they are making this. The movies rob zombie did weren‚Äôt that great tbh, this one looks very promising can not wait."
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS LEGIT GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really good
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG
ek1ePFp-nBI,Perfection
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good!! Can't wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this is the last one this will be one hell of a way to close out this saga
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So Blumhouse is working on not only a Halloween movie, but a Five nights at Freddy's movie as well. Hm"
ek1ePFp-nBI,A straight movie follow up to one of the best horrors ever 40 years later im dying can't wait for michael to wear the mask again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is his mask CGI???!?
ek1ePFp-nBI,BLUMHOUSE? LETS GO!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh thank God, I thought Rob Zombie was in it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"As much as I love Halloween, this trend of ignoring (good!) sequels is such tremendous bullshit. This looks like every one of the other Halloween films. Zombies version wasn't perfect but at least fresh air. Absolutely no need for this one"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bad ass laurie strode back better than ever
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn! Now that's how you release a trailer. I have shivers all over me. üò≥üò±
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait to see this movie

ek1ePFp-nBI,What a day to be a horror nerd am i right?
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG .... Amo el tr√°iler <3
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I was skeptical over the last couple of years hearing about this movie. But I must say, the movie looks GOOD! I‚Äôm genuinely excited!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome. It‚Äôd be nice if Friday the 13th was still happening though..
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the Halloween movies but this looks like complete shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i remember that female, true lies , with arnie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let's hope it delivers in October, looks great and cannot wait to watch it in October."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis still looks great for her age. That Activia yogurt really payed off.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"New Halloween movie plot.

Jamie Lee Curtis cures Michael Myers IBS with Activia Yogurt, which turns out, was the cause of his murderous rage to being with.  

Roll Credits."

Just saying

Edit: 2.3k dislikes. Smh"
ek1ePFp-nBI,How I can't wait to watch this on theaters and scream yet again on a dumb character for tripping or being too slow
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The metaphor of Halloween (2018), based on the trailer: reality can create morality so that it has a visual appearance"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Does this dude age? How does he get time to stay swole? Why does he hate the bitch? So many unanswered questions.
ek1ePFp-nBI,How I love the music
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandma with the shotgun LMAO
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks too badass and awesome! Also 1:55 gave me chills!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why couldn't they give it more creative title?
ek1ePFp-nBI,So apparently John wick was sent to kill this guy but didn't succeed? Seems more like it with all those movies he madeüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:35 Surprise Motherfucker!

And now Halloween 
AMAZING!!! 
Now pls let there be an aquaman trailer"
ek1ePFp-nBI,one question..  What about Halloween ressuresion or something that at the beginning Michael killed Laurie with a knife in the back?  How come he was encarcerated for 40 years?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how Michael setting the dog off is a reference to his habit of killing dogs. He even ate one in the original.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:00 Such a classic scene... when Michael bumps into someone
ek1ePFp-nBI,Silver shamrock masks from Halloween III at 2:06
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else noticed the Halloween 3 masks at 2:07?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yus I‚Äôm so fucking excited I love the way they combined the vintage look with rob zombies mask
ek1ePFp-nBI,SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've been waiting 40 years, for this movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,It was stupid changing him to not be her brother
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rob zombie is SHOOK
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT I CAN'T WAIT...IM CALLING IT THE BEST HORROR MOVIE OF THE YEAR
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fucking shit!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I weird if The best dreams I have are when I dream about Michael Myers after me!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Interested...My favorite part was when the interviewer pulls out his mask which is in surprisingly good condition and the whole prison yard goes nuts.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really good. Wow. I'm not even a big fan of the franchise. Looks like the first time producers took it seriously since 1978.
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:37 Michael: Hello kiddies.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why is he not her brother??? good god lets ruin another famous horror icon.......
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stoked!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I so going to see this movie then it comes out it so awesome üòÄüòÅüòÑüëªüëªüëª‚ò†üñíüíñüíñüíñüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,precisava mostrar o filme inteiro mesmo?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is more of a showdown movie than a Michael Myers horror movie typical of film makers in 2018, not a bad trailer but it's probably overcompensating for how bad the acting will actually be lol not interested at all."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sorry John wick but the real boogeyman returns to claim its name.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael always barely seen in small closets yet hes 6‚Äô7 250 lbs
ek1ePFp-nBI,Body count continues...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck me sideways. Chills all over. Can't wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally a trailer for this movie and I‚Äôm so damn excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Haluk Bilginer gururumuzsun, üáπüá∑"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good but very Rob Zombieish
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck yeah
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hope it doesn't fail!
Looks good!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this one isn't as shitty as Rob Zombies remakes.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait! October couldnt come fast enough!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It looks like a well made film, so far, but to be honest I'm not sure how I feel about the movie as a whole. To be honest, I kind of like the whole ""unstoppable killing machine"" Michael, and him and Laurie being siblings. To add to it, I loved the actor that they used for Rob Zombie's remake. Big, scary, intimidating, and fits well into what I would expect¬† Michael Myers would be like in real life. Anyway, we'll just have to wait and see if this will live up to the hype. Good trailer, but very uncertain about the film."
ek1ePFp-nBI,#OldManMyers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Stop putting mini trailers before trailers guys just show the fucking trailer immediately
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who's here before a million üôã. Let's get it boys and girls Michael is back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jesus C h r i s t, a current day horror movie that seems to actually be worth watching? Man I'm so excited, an actual good horror movie has been unheard of for so long and I'm genuinely happy about this."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"With all these series and its original cast returning, i expect a sequel and returning cast for the 1922 nosferatu. I cant wait to see old faces."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Only the music gives me goosebumps.
Looking so forward!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hate how they‚Äôre ignoring Halloween 2 was the best one in my opinion.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Please give us that same feeling that we all felt when I saw the first Halloween movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't usually expect great cinematography from horror films but that shot of the prison outside had me sold. This looks great
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I am gonna miss the fact they they were brother and sister, but this still looks amazing non the less."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hopefully this will reboot the ""killer"" type horror movies...I'm sick of Paranormal Activity and Insidious type movies"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Super awesome üòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH MY GAWD üòç‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This doesn't make sense. When Michael fell out the window after getting shot by Dr. Loomis his body disappeared so how could he possibly be taken into custody? Consistency has become a major problem in Hollywood.

I'm hoping to get those answers in October because I always go into the cinema with an open mind."
ek1ePFp-nBI,YESSSSSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought the trailer was ok nothing amazing and I hope he is still her brother or related somehow cause just going after her cause he can I think is dumb but I hope the movie is good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Plot Twist: Danny McBride is Micheal Myers.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Nobody cared who he was until he put on the mask.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"What is it with Michael Myers and bathroom stalls lol, anyway I‚Äôm excited for the movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm stoked about this. Honestly I'm perfectly cool with everything the first movie being irrelevant cuz honestly everything after first got stupid
ek1ePFp-nBI,Doesn't this take place after Halloween 2?
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope someone shoots a rocket launcher at him in the film and there‚Äôs an explosion but he slowly walks out of it!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:26
Did Michael just find a new babysitter?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,please let him die permanently
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg this looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"IF this is good AND a HIT,   we could be in for another horror wave, dear fans.."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This makes it even more scarier than the original! My gosh! Nothing matters anymore! He's just a very insane mental patient. OMG.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks pretty decent and I love all Michael Myers movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"–≠—Ç–æ , –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ, –∞—Ö—É–µ–Ω–Ω–æ !"
ek1ePFp-nBI,takes place before h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cant fucking wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Take my money
ek1ePFp-nBI,That actually looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Heck, freaking, yes"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Shape is back! Beware....
ek1ePFp-nBI,ONE OF MY BEST HORROR MOVIE TRAILERS EVER! I think this is going to do really good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm super excited... The only thing is that I wish it had a more subtle vibe and showed less blood. Just to keep it in the same spirit as the first one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has been a great week for trailers!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Should i see the original before i watch this one?
ek1ePFp-nBI,When he bangs his head on the bathroom door to try an open it is pretty fucking legit!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,this movie looks amazing!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone notice  ""Smoke Purge"" button at the mental hospital scene in the beginning? Allusion to the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest I'm guessing?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For the record, no matter how many times I've hated on the sequels, I do like them. I don't love them, they're definitely in my top 10 Star Wars movies though. I like the hates memes from them and think they're funny. And I like the trailers more than then movies themselves."
ek1ePFp-nBI,No
ek1ePFp-nBI,Grandpa Michael!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"No thanks, don't wanna see people get horribly murdered.
But Jamie Lee looks awesome in this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Now, I'm like Peter Griffith on ecstasy."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow i got the chills
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks really good I will definitely be seeing this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM NOT CUCKING READY
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I get it, Hollywood. You're awesome.
But JESUS, don't you know it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,So it‚Äôs a direct sequel to the first Halloween movie but this sequel is also called Halloween?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"*HYPE HAS COME TO YOUR LITTLE TOWN, SHERIFF!*
*YOU CAN EITHER IGNORE IT OR ENJOY IT!*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait wasn't he set on fire in the second one? Or is that not canon. Sorry I'm new to this franchise and I've noticed there's so many damn sequels.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally another great Halloween that makes Michael scary again
ek1ePFp-nBI,Bruh 2018 has been having me feel like a kid again. I can‚Äôt fucking wait for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That theme will never get old, absolute masterpiece!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Slipknot you??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Actually looks scary
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks really good
ek1ePFp-nBI,This movie better make me afraid of the closet again..
ek1ePFp-nBI,"OH FUCK!

Will Michael kill a child? 

HOW IS THIS ENDING GONNA PLAY OUT? 

Will we see the kill where he rips those teeth out?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I was all excited to see this trailer, and then I saw the trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Masons sucks !!
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's a trailer.what is the idea behind showing few seconds of the trailer before the trailer itself.? :)
ek1ePFp-nBI,It looks really bad
ek1ePFp-nBI,#Actualfanswhowokeupat7amtowatchthisbefore1millionviewstoshowofinthiscomment
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let's clear this up:  Danny McBride chose not to include the second film because it established Laurie as his sister.  It was only decided to make Laurie his sister after the success of the original movie.  The decision to make her his sister was made because 1.) they didn't want the ""babysitter killer"" story to get old and 2.) Jamie Lee Curtis made her character Laurie so compelling that they needed an excuse to bring her back for the sequel...  

For the 2018 movie, Danny McBride chose to exclude the sibling relationship because he felt it made Michael less terrifying.  If his primary motivation for killing is just to kill his sister, it gives the audience a sense of security, knowing they will be safe as long as they stay away from his relatives.  I was disappointed by this because I love the journey Laurie's character takes in the original franchise, going from a real victim suffering from PTSD to a strong survivor who faced her fears (minus the god awful Halloween Resurrection).  But then after watching the 2018 trailer, I instantly looked over my shoulder in paranoia, so Danny's choice worked...  

Another disappointment of mine is disregarding all of the other films.  Don't get me wrong:  With the exception of Halloween 1, 2, and H20, the rest are pretty shitty (in my opinion).  But I HATE discontinuity.  I'd rather work hard to clean up and wrap up a declining franchise than just ""reboot"" it.  A reboot-sequel (I know this movie is NOT a full reboot) like this usually satisfies dedicated fans, but confuses new viewers who aren't familiar.

My only lasting disappointment is the removal of the supernatural element. And I'm not talking about the dumb backstory that Michael has to kill his family as some sacrifice.  I'm talking about Carpenter's original description of Michael as ""The Shape;"" this raw insatiable shark-like evil that will stop at nothing to kill her.  A darkness that can't be reasoned with.  I don't want him to be invincible, but someone stronger than the strongest man and more animalistic than any animal.  While I only like Halloweens 1, 2, and H20, I do like how the evil essence of Michael is an unkillable energy that can be passed on after his death (like to his niece Jamie in Halloween 4).  Sadly, serial killers are a dime a dozen, so they'll have to work hard to separate Michael Myers from the rest."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:52-1:55OOF
ek1ePFp-nBI,Whether the film will be released in India or not
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hell yeah I can‚Äôt wait I‚Äôm only 17 but I love the Halloween franchise I grew up watching Halloween with my parents and fell in love with the movies I‚Äôm sooo excited
ek1ePFp-nBI,I thought she was killed in Halloween resurrection....
ek1ePFp-nBI,The scene where he dropped the teeth...
ek1ePFp-nBI,WIG OMG TEENAGERS FOUND LIFELESS
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't stop watching this!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è So happy they're ignoring all the crappy ones that came out in between!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks...good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope it will be good (Because it‚Äôs made by Blumhouse)
ek1ePFp-nBI,That mask looks GREAT
ek1ePFp-nBI,John Carpenter has again done his job well
ek1ePFp-nBI,#nostalgia
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope this can keep a bit of the cheesiness the original movies had from 1-5
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why is no one talking about the throwbacks??? Toilet stall from H20, escaped patients from the original, murder of the mechanic from halloween 4 and the ghost bedsheet from the original!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,FINAALLY
ek1ePFp-nBI,PLEASE BE GOOD & NOT RUIN THE ORIGINAL ‚ù§Ô∏è
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was hoping it was taking place after Hallowwen 6... but I it looks kinda good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Great trailer. Can‚Äôt wait to see the new reboot sequel from the last original film and it‚Äôs quite good. Jamie Lee Curtis can handle her bravery like a strong female hero like Ellen Ripley in ‚ÄúAliens,‚Äù Michael Myers‚Äô return his original killings since the first movie, and it looks pretty creepy, haunting, suspense, and chilling. One of my all time favorite horror films has finally started for over 40 years and I‚Äôm glad that Carpenter who will produce and Blumhouse will make their comeback good."
ek1ePFp-nBI,so glad they use the original score for the trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm honestly just hoping this film DOES NOT SUCK. I‚Äôve seen the original a couple of times, and I‚Äôm actually a fan. I hope they make this a serious horror film - cause from what I‚Äôm seeing & sensing I feel like they inserted a comedy feel to it. Anyway, yeah PLEASE BE GOOD"
ek1ePFp-nBI,AAAAH E CARALHO üéâ‚ù§
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I know how to play the ""Halloween Theme"" on on piano, bass, and guitar."

ek1ePFp-nBI,SO.... MUCH.... HYPE!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is going to be amazing, so excited!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm so excited! If this movie is a hit, then they should retry a horror anthology series and finally put Micheal Myers to rest."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh my god looks good. But let‚Äôs be honest here ppl. We all wanted Halloween 9 aka resurrectum 2.0 I mean how sick was ‚ÄúTRICK OR TREAT..... MUTHAFUCKA. This looks good but real fans will want Halloween resurrectum 2.0....






I keed I keed, lol. Just wanted to troll some of you. FUCK HALLOWEEN RESURRECTUM. This looks incredible!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh my god I'm so excited for this!!!!!!! Also bless you Grace with that scare at the end lol

To answer your question Grace I'm excited to see the return of Michael and Jamie going head to head plus Halloween needs fixing after Rob Zombie lol"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It has so many reference to the halloween 4 and 5 scenes :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The movie has so many scenes like refferences or tribute to the others sequels like H20, H4 and also Rob Zombie¬¥s movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my God!!!!!! I can't wait to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The hype is real.

ek1ePFp-nBI,OMFG THIS LOOKS FUCKING AMAZINGGGGG. WELCOME HOME MICHAEL!!!! :D <3333
ek1ePFp-nBI,I feel like this the movie should begin. Michael fell down from the house he disappeared 1978. cops Capture him then we see him in the prison
ek1ePFp-nBI,Patiently waiting for jay and mike from WeWatchedAMovie to react to this shit. GODDAMMIT MICHAEL!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For people who are a tad confused about this film, allow me to break it down for you. This Halloween is the sequel to the original Halloween by John Carpenter, taking place 40 years after the original film in which Michael Myers was apprehended presumably after he ran off after he was shot by Loomis. This film retcons every single sequel following that ending which means Laurie Strode and Michael Myers are no longer siblings. 

Also for those thinking this film will receive sequels, you're dead wrong. Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter are intending this to be the last showdown between Laurie and Michael and finally give a definitive ending to the Halloween franchise, that's the only reason they wanted to make this film. So take it all in because this trailer, this event is a once in a lifetime opportunity to go witness one of horror's greatest icons on the big screen. This looks like it's going to be amazing and as someone who never got to witness Halloween, I'm going to enjoy this immensely. 

The music gave me goosebumps, welcome back Michael, you terrifying bastard."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why Jamie Lee Curtis looks like Bruce Willis with a wig?
ek1ePFp-nBI,already returned hallowen now missing Friday 13 how many years is expected for Friday the 13th: 'v?
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUUUUCK IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,One thing that I can't get over...Michael Myers is in his 60's. How scary and menacing could he really be at this stage in his life?...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"WHO ELSE GOT SCARED LIKE ME? 
im 12 btw"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The homage they are paying is everything! This is just badass! That window scene where he was staring down from the bedroom, EPIC a f!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am so glad this looks so dope!!! FINALLY A SLASHER FILM!!! Let the Boogie man reign!! üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Honestly... the fact that they're calling it just ""Halloween"" kinda pisses me off. It's a sequel. Halloween was back in 1978!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HELL YEAH!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Night He Came Home.
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's back...
ek1ePFp-nBI,So did Danny Mcbride end up directing this??
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Pre-watching the trailer thought: It‚Äôs kinda sad how Hollywood keeps rehashing classics, revising them to make newer ones.... BUT AT THE SAME TIME, as horror fans, these type of films actually excite the hell out of me!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Evil is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my mf god
ek1ePFp-nBI,504 people liked the awful Rob Zombie remake.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"When I first heard that they would be disregarding the second film and the fact that he is Laurie‚Äôs brother, I wasn‚Äôt sure how the film would go or how I‚Äôd feel about it. After watching the trailer I‚Äôm all Down for this new twist and turn of sequence. I like how they brought in the fact that the two of them being siblings is a myth. Which clears a way for a new storyline. Genius move Danny and David.  Now the question is , why? If they aren‚Äôt siblings why did he go after HER? Did he decide to go after her the moment he first saw her when she was dropping off the key to the Meyers house? Or was it something else?! I‚Äôm so excited to see what this new movie has to bring for us! I will be buying my ticket in advance. This is a MUST see"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I watched 20 years later last night because that was the last Halloween made that scares the shit out of me. Just watching this makes me relive the horror I felt for Michael when I was a kid growing up
ek1ePFp-nBI,Would've been better if the light was off in the closet only to reveal Michael's white face just hovering their in the dark.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who else is excited to see this movie üòÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,meh
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is involved? I'm in.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie is gonna kick his ass lmao
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks WAY better than Rob Zombie's Halloween! Carpenter's back and it's gonna be AWESOME!




By the way... that closet scene...
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ ...that's great!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hey guys check out my Michael Myers Song https://youtu.be/qN3z55fG5LU
ek1ePFp-nBI,Playing dead by daylight while waiting for the movieüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I see some of these movies as a chance of letting this generation of kids see what their parents grew up with. Specifically this movie, Halloween was a big part with a lot of people and its time to keep that up. But don't get me wrong, most of these films aren't as great as the original but it's a start."
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:18 that recoil... :P
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hi Guy, You get more movie Hollywood with https://hellomovies.com/"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"cannot wait, going to so good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,If this not her brother why he coming for her?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Honestly where are the pre orders?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚ÄúYou....

LETS GO!!!! This is it the one we‚Äôve been waiting for guys üî™"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Where are all my Michale Myers Fans At !
ek1ePFp-nBI,ahhhhhhhhhh im so fucking excited !!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,What?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michaaaael...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"In October of 1978, I was a junior in high school.  My friends and I went to see the original Halloween movie on its Friday night opening. I will never forget that there were people leaving their seats and heading towards the back of the theater and then standing there to continue watching it.  They were so scared.  Halloween, like JAWS, is a classic scare movie.  What is impressive about the original film is that there is not a single drop of blood shown from Michael‚Äôs killings.  No gore factor like the SAW films.  Just pure scare.  40 years later, I cannot wait to see this follow-up story.  Jamie Lee Curtis looks like she is going to kick some serious ass!  Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode!  Kiss Ass Bitches!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The best killer ever Michael fucking Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank you danny mcbride
ek1ePFp-nBI,I cannot breathe. This is going to be so incredible. I am actually shaking
ek1ePFp-nBI,I AM SHOOK!!!! October can't get here fast enough!
ek1ePFp-nBI,i bet its gonna suck
ek1ePFp-nBI,The 2nd remake. See if this beat out rob zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks promising
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm really excited! This looks promising.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This Movie Looks Wonderful!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,At 2.10 she shoots him in the head. Proud to tell that this scene has been copied from a Marathi movie named Zhapatlela Marathis in D house hit like!!! Anyone? No. Ok i cri.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Halloween: Days of future past
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The OG is BACK, baby! Put ya knifes up in celebration!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait till October
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant belibe they canceled Friday the 13th part 2 for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,The mask is such an important part of the movie's mythos.
ek1ePFp-nBI,LOOKS AMAZING!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Very gritty vibe, but a variance from Rob Zombie's vision. It's great to see Jamie Lee back in action and owning her legendary role in what looks to be a promising return to form for Halloween."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cant wait. Goodbye edges.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This shit looks fucking dope cant wait to see it
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like it‚Äôs going to be the best Halloween movie of all 11 of them!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am Home alone and this trailer SCARED ME
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn Activia made grandma go wild
ek1ePFp-nBI,And Carpenter is directing it so you know it‚Äôs good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"For horror fans this is our Star Wars, the movie event of the year, we've waited for so long and endured that Rob Zombie crap.

Fucking finally the wait is almost over <3"
ek1ePFp-nBI,yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss                                                             yes
ek1ePFp-nBI,"You know how, in 1998, they came out with Jamie Lee Curtis in _Halloween H20: 20 Years Later_ ? Does that then make this _Halloween H40:  40 Years Later_ ? üòÑüíÄüéÉ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I will predict it will be the best horror movie of the year, and hopefully break some records as far as a halloween movie goes.

#Halloween2018

aka Dr. Loomis: ""I prayed that he would burn in hell, but in my heart, I knew hell wouldn't have him"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So, they made a sequel that ignores every other sequels so that they could contunie making sequels. Hm.

That sounds logical!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm waiting on tickets to go up for sale. Afew things confused me about some scenes though like why bring him his signature mask? It's like they're cheering him on or egging him on. 2. why is he out in the wide open surrounded by kids? I remember a similar scene in Halloween 1, but he only ran into one kid and the rest were already gone. Now he's surrounded by kids, lol. Oh well. I'm still exciteddddddd."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks incredible!
ek1ePFp-nBI,About time we get a classic Michael Myers movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I‚Äôm confused. In the bathroom scene, Michael‚Äôs hair looks long."
ek1ePFp-nBI,üòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Can't wait man, loved how they did a continuation after 1978 and ignored the other garbage besides 2, I loved 2 a lot.  The first two Halloween movies were the best and after that, majority of them were either meh or just plain silly."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Joe Grizzly deserves a rematch for when he's not on the toilet taking a shit.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is going to be AWESOME ASF!!! I LOVE Jamie Lee Curtis, Nick Castle and John Carpenter! His movies r always the best also aside from Wes Craven's and Stephen Kings movies as well! They worked so hard on this! I'm so Excited to see this! üòçüòÑüòÜüôåüëèüëèüëè"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone else watch this while eating 3 year old halloween candy they found in their closet while looking for their michael myers mask?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omfg yassssssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,Alright!

ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks proper shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween, Suspiria, Hereditary, A quiet place. This is turning into one of the best years for Horror movies in a long, long time."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Welcome home, Michael and Laurie.

We've missed you."
ek1ePFp-nBI,so the 1981 movie didnt happen????? thats the only time he wouldve ben caught lol.....l also they need to get someone who can actually play micheal like nick castle did ....get it fucking right or hire me and give me thorosine .
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis gone all Sarah Connor. üò≥
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish the movie included Halloween 2 so we could get the whole Michael being related to Laurie strode. Now that Laurie has a daughter and grandchild Michael could of had more family to hunt down and kill. But now that can't happen because they apprehended Michael who had been shot (maybe 6 times) by Loomis. Since they apprehended Michael I'm scared that he might not be the same unstoppable killing force we fell in love throughout the franchise.
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't normally get scared at movies but this really speak to me I noticed there was a man in the background wearing a black mask that scared me this lady in the trailer is my hero #JamieLeeCurtis #HalloweenH2O #H20 #2Thousand117 #2018 Halloween #JamieLeeCurtisIsBay
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,The man has a knife. Get yourself a gun. He shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to kill.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm heartbroken 2-6 don't happen because I think they made Michael Myers more of a scary shape, but I'll totally be in line day one to see this one. I watch all 10 every year. It's my favorite movie series."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I have never been so hyped on a horror movie! I did not even see previous Halloween movies :D
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my fucking gosh!!! He's returned!! Long live the boogeyman!üéÉüéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so realistic
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks lame... I'll still watch though.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes let's get it!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"If they can do Halloween justice like this, then there's no reason they can't do a proper F13 reboot. Just keep it in the family,and have Blumhouse do it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Still walking after ALL THESE YEARS!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is going to flop. And they basically showed the whole movie in the trailer lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,*PLEASE DON'T FLOP*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That's great that they show some homages from previous films, but I hope it becomes its own movie instead of all the fright scenes just being solely homages. I'm sure they did that with the trailer for marketing purposes. Not too impressed with the trailer, but looks better than any halloween movie in well forever."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm gonna see the movie as all new for the first time then after just take it as John‚Äôs 3 and final chapter to his other makings of Halloween because it all seems to complete themselves after this movieüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is the year of horror. A Quiet Place, The Nun, Hereditary and now Halloween. üî•üî•üî•"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I swear if my closet door doesn't close am running
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hi Michael..üôÑüôÑ
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks incredible! The original is my favorite movie. I am freaking out over Jamie Lee and this amazing atmosphere/music! üòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Kind of bad that they retconned Halloween 2, that one was actually decent"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I haven‚Äôt watched any movie jajaj I only know Michael because of Call of Duty Ghosts lol.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i spit on your grave, michael myers would had been a pretty cool title"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:01
Gotta love that middle finger to the bad Halloween sequels, I‚Äôm ready for a good slasher movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only thing this trailer lacks, especially in the bathroom stall scene, is Joe Grizlly"
ek1ePFp-nBI,They might actually pull off a great sequel. I love the idea of throwing the others in the garbage and starting fresh.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hops is ,                      not dead"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!!!! Omfgggggg @1:58 how Michael looks and moves it's like a combo of Nick castle and Dick Warlock
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wished my brother Shaun had lived to see this film. Carpenter and Curtis returns to take a final bow.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks really, really good! I pray that this will be a standalone followup to the original and not the start of a new franchise/cinematic universe. Please just give us a fitting finale to this series and its legendary characters"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I hope they don‚Äôt retcon the fact that Laurie is his sister
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wait. How old is Michael Myers in this movie?
ek1ePFp-nBI,i almost lost my teeths....üò®
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Phenomenal Trailer, can‚Äôt wait for this!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thanks for giving away half the movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Which is this movies first part ?? Anyone know
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""See anything you like"""
ek1ePFp-nBI,I was laughing through the whole video because of my exitement and hype!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm watching this in theaters
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks amazingüòç
ek1ePFp-nBI,"My god, the scene where the closet door won't shut is terrifying!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This has made my year. Watching from Ireland üáÆüá™ fan for over 30 years üéÉüò±üè†
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Of fuck yea I can wait to see halloween 2018 and the real trailer on yea!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,The only reason Carpenter wrote that Laurie and Michael were siblings in Halloween 2 was because of writer's block. He himself has stated that he regretted that decision as it took away from the mystery of Michael Myers. Because what you don't know is always scarier. So that's why this is a direct sequel to the original and also in order for Michael to appear more human and less of a supernatural being that he was in the sequels.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The girl in 2:22 is the same girl at 2:27. Michael defiantly attack's her, but what happens to the little boy is my question?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG!!! Looks insane
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just missing Dr. Loomis everything else is the same and so good, especially J. Lee Curtis üî™üëçüòéüéÉüò±"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg yaaaaaaaas this gave me the chills!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Pause it at 1:49 !!! A bloody Michael Myers üòà
ek1ePFp-nBI,I haven't heard that classic theme in a while! Welcome back Myers!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Evil has returned!!!! üéÉüî™
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh...my...god
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Seems very promising, looks way better than the Rob Zombie Halloween movies, screw those."
ek1ePFp-nBI,üëèüëèüëèüëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck. Yes. Scrap all of those awful sequels and keep this as the one and only proper sequel. THANK YOU.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The last time I checked, Halloween isn't on October the 19th"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The tune's a masterpiece
ek1ePFp-nBI,WELL...I'm there on October 19th. How 'bout You?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"And people say RZ did a bad jobüòí

This is will suck"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes. Yes! YES! TAKE ME MICHAEL MYERS I AWAIT YOUR LOVING EMBRACE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I wish they had Michael creep out of the darkness in the closet scene like the original, awesome trailer"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just hope it's not gonna be another one of those shitty one liner comedies just like every other movie these days
ek1ePFp-nBI,Michael Myers the type of dude to make a sandwich in your house without asking.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, some good fucking horror movie"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm so excited I have been waiting for the trailer to premiere all damn night üëèüèæüëèüèæ
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why would you put your hands up to a knife? Bitch I woulda jumped back so quickly once I was him in the closet.. SMH I hope the dumb blonde gets shanked
ek1ePFp-nBI,Look's awesome!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I always know michael myers will return sense 2009üéÉüéÉüî™üî™üó°
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow! This looks awesome.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awww shit!! My 21st birthdays gonna be a good one! Can‚Äôt wait for the 19th!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wonder if we will see his face again in this one. Mi...Chael... Lol can't wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:59 OMG that  sound effect!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Question though...when the kid asks her to close the closet door why leave the light on? She should have turned the light off first. But then she'd have known Michael was in there...
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so doooooope.
ek1ePFp-nBI,H40
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Hopefully they bring back Friday the 13th this well and nightmare on elm street, imagine Jason mike and Freddy side by side in a horror universe , maybe even chucky, I‚Äôm shaking in my boots"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Will the character Dr. Loomis be in it tho?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"AWESOME Trailer!

WOW, Will Patton is also in This Movie. He is a Great Actor!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I just hope they don't show too much of Michael and have the camera linger on him for ages like some of the later sequels did. What was so perfect and haunting about the original was that you never really saw him until the very climax of the film, until then he was always in the shadows or background getting closer and closer until he struck. That was scary. Just having the camera on him all the time as he goes about his business will kill all of the suspense.

I'll just say that I'm cautiously optimistic and excited but have a few concerns based off this trailer."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Someone explain this to me pls.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Two things I love how they're continuing the original storyline instead of the Rob Zombie version. Also secondly this is one strong ass old man LOL.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg I‚Äôm so happy all the shity ones don‚Äôt exist practically and they have the right music and mask!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg...
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks good. Hope they fix the initial ending with the re-shoots, and the film will probably be damn near perfect"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The only thing that has me worried is all the references to the other movies, i.e. the gas station and bathroom scenes being from part 4 and H20. But yet they are making this one a direct sequel to the original. Seems kind of lazy when you dont need to do all of that for anyone other than fans like myself."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thank you, Blumhouse and Mr. Carpenter to reintroducing a new generation to the slasher genre. No winking nods. No inside jokes. Just sheer terror. Oh, and that score..../winces"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The dog and the inmates can sense Michaels Evil when the mask is unveiled. Goes to show how naive the media are when it comes to Michael Myers. They will wish they never set foot at Smiths Grove Sanitarium. Michel will show them what they came to film though. If I were in that world of Halloween, I would go anywhere near it. Evil on two legs interview? Um ill pass. . Man this looks scary can't wait to see it on October 19th."
ek1ePFp-nBI,40 years this bastards gotta be like 80 or 90 years old who the hell is he killing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"1:13 Can someone confirm if that's Hunt from Halloween 2? It looks like him, but I'm not 100% positive..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is simply.... amazing.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Back in the original Halloween 2, that was when it was told that Michael was Laurie's brother, but in the original movie that was never said to be. The reason why they are redoing all the sequels including the first 2nd one is that they were all boring and had lots of mistakes, unless if you thought they were not boring. That's why they made a modern Halloween part 2 sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,need jason
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Unrelated 

This is a clear sequel, and it is simply titled ""Halloween"". 
So why the hell did they decide to name the last Superman movie ""man of steel""?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,The mask reminds me of the rob zombie mask but still the trailer looks awesome can't wait to see michael do some more killing
ek1ePFp-nBI,"First off, I‚Äôm as excited for this film as anyone else! Second, has anyone else noticed that Blumhouse seems to be the film company producing the most horror flicks these days?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:57 Jurassic Park ? OMG MYERS IS THE INDORAPTOR ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is that the Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross version of the song?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Just. Fucking. Stop.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dean Munsch could take on both Michael and Laurie at the same time.  #ScreamQueens
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This trailer give me chills, i'm waiting for this movie with good expectations."
ek1ePFp-nBI,00:57 Welcome to Jurassic Park
ek1ePFp-nBI,LMFAO
ek1ePFp-nBI,So those sequels we've been watching was all a big lie??
ek1ePFp-nBI,My most anticipated film of the year!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally a new good horror movie , I‚Äôve been dreaming of a new Halloween by John Carpenter and question how can Michael not be her brother that‚Äôs a fact I thought ?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yooooooo my spooky ass is crying I‚Äôm so excited for this üò≠üò≠üò≠
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is such a badass \m/
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many new trailers giving me new reasons to live
ek1ePFp-nBI,Speechless.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yo! That last scene, of this trailer, still got to me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,O my god its jamie i love u
ek1ePFp-nBI,I can't be the only one tired of Laurie Strode/Jamie Lee Curtis?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yea that's a great idea journalists! Show the giant 7 foot, psychopath something you know will excite him!
What could go wrong?? üòé"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üéÉüî™

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael's back! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Freddy Krueger, Michael Myres,  Leatherface, Jason Vrohees. These are iconic horror villains of all time. This reminds me of my school days and childhood. Our age as awesome! Sleepless Nights are back!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wanted another from Rob Zombie
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Awesome trailer! A little early to say this but this could very be the best Halloween sequel of all time! If this film gains great success, hopefully killers like Jason or Freddy might get another shot at rebooting their films but it seems less likely for them to return but who knows, just peer speculation."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The closet scene is amazing cause the boogeyman comes from the closets and Michael Myers is known as the boogeyman.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks a thousand times better than the Rob Zombie remake.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Don't call it Halloween if it's a SEQUEL...other than that, looks pretty decent."

ek1ePFp-nBI,well it has some of the scenes from the cinema con trailer but it does look really good and my god its really good
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks amazing! Just, please keep the teen drama to a minimum, Laurie Strode 4 life and stuff!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yessss!!! I was hoping they were gonna rid themselves of that brother sister bullshit that made Michael Myers way less scary. I'm hyped!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Amazing trailer, really seems to capture the spirit and essence of what made the original film so special.  Looking forward to seeing this film!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Retcon nightmare on elk street
ek1ePFp-nBI,Well this looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,Im so ready for this!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Strong empowered women fights demons.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This mask and this music it causes goose bumps...!!
I can not wait"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Omg ! This ain't shit but a remake of all the other Halloween movies put in one 
And Drop the tough girl hero shit already 
SMFH..."
ek1ePFp-nBI,wtf TOO MUCH LIGHT
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow looks really good
ek1ePFp-nBI,Before 100k views AND trending
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I know getting excited over a trailer almost always ends in disappointment, but that was FU#KIN AWESOME! Can't wait!! üéÉüó°Ô∏èüíÄ"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So is Laurie not his sister in this film? Or was her granddaughter just covering the truth up?
????"
ek1ePFp-nBI,My heart is racing I am so excited i‚Äôm gonna combust
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm excited, Halloween is going back to it's roots, while also making all those crappy sequels non canon, hooray (sorry to anyone who liked the sequels)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,So many trailers this week
ek1ePFp-nBI,Speechless... Love this trailer!! Thank God for John Carpenter
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The Shape is back, baby!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,That's my nigga
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"#timesup Michael, Laurie is about to kick your ass."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Really really!!! Hope this comes to HHN 2018!!!‚ò∫üëçüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,My favorite boogeyman!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This was scary.... Excited for the movie
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG SO EXCITED LIKE IF YOU AGREE
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i was sceptical but this could be really good.  i love especially scene in rest stop with those teeths, really creepy"
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHERE ARE MY KILLERFICKS FELLAS?????
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The king of slashers is back and looks better than ever! This has so much nostalgia towards the original it‚Äôs unreal, definitely the justice that the original film deserves after the train wrecks!
*cough rob zombie cough*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"They just HAD to throw the token black kid in there,  it is 2018 and you can't even show a tv commercial without at least one black. Diversity is just so wonderful."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks fantastic!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awwww Fuck
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael come get me this Halloween üéÉ 
I‚Äôm waiting for you!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I don't think I've ever been more excited for a movie!! Michael is the baddest there is!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,LETS GO
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:41 kinda like the sence from H4
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks like it'll do justice to the franchise. I get the old school Halloween feel from this trailer. Hopefully it lives up to it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIT!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil. This is the only thing you need to know about Michael Myers."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yo this is that sauce. Michael is back.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait üôè
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why come back now, Michael? You‚Äôve waited 40 years. If you want another victim, take me. But leave those people in Haddonfield alone."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"let‚Äôs be hopeful , the reason I‚Äôm quite optimistic is that Jamie Leee Curtis is like a professional at how this movie should go as she was in the very first original film and properly offered a lot of input , should be good"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This is the best movie horrror saga, this Iconic, this is epic.
I'm also ready for this"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hopefully this turns out GREAT and it's not some cheap jump scare fest.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This week should be celebrated as ""movie trailers week""........"
ek1ePFp-nBI,HALLOWEEN: FORTY YEARS LATER
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuckin Jesus baby!!!!!!!!!!! This looks awesome!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow this does look really good!!! I haven't been this excited for a movie in a long time!!! üòÄ
ek1ePFp-nBI,IS THAT YOU MAD MAX? YOU MAKE ME SCREAM LIKE A LITTLE GIRL OMG!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"2:28 close door it pops open
Michael: giggles softly
She tries again, door pops open.
Michael: dying trying not to laugh
She tries door one more time and slowly opens it
Michael: TRICK OR TREAT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeassssssssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Why are they ignoring 2? That was the only good sequel (excluding 3) and now it didn't happen?
But even putting that aside this trailer doesn't really impress me."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"When i first heard about this movie i was spitting on it hard, but after watching the trailer it looks very good, i hated every Halloween movie after the third one which was special, all the rest was money grabbing shit, worst Halloween 8 in the cybercam house...... this one looks very promising good that Rob Zombie stayed away from this one."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I'm unimpressed, based upon the trailer it looks like it'll be a retread of the original Halloween with Myers stalking the Halloween night with maybe some new ideas with the mental institution but over-all just an excuse to see Laurie again."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Movies would be received a lot better if their trailers didn‚Äôt reveal so damn much
ek1ePFp-nBI,This trailer looks amazing! I‚Äôm looking forward to this! And I love the little homages to the sequels added in the trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg i cant wait
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, I've been waiting all my life for this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
ek1ePFp-nBI,That closet part ahhhhhhhh lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,I LOL-ed at this more than I did The Mummy (2017)!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay, I'm *in.*"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôve never been so excited for anything in my life! But we have another timeline in this series to confuse everyone but the hype is real!
ek1ePFp-nBI,#BenTramerLives
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The beginning of the trailer I thought this was fake.....Halloween Official Trailer? Looks a bit amateurish. Story looks good and creepy. As far as the ‚Äúlook‚Äù of the movie, the lghting is nowhere near spooky and almost looks B-level. Michael in a brightly lit closet? Hopefully they fix a lot of this in post production."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Severing the brother/sister story is as bad as Darth Vader not being Luke's Father. The only thing that's wrong with this, and it's a BIG wrong."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy f### ive been waiting for a Halloween sequel done RIGHT this already looks like it will exceed expectations... October cant come soon enough
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS SHIT IS ABOUT TO BE FUCKING AWESOME!
ek1ePFp-nBI,how many times can I watch this in a row??
ek1ePFp-nBI,Dead by daylight killer lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I might be wrong here, but wasn‚Äôt the original idea for Halloween II, take place several years after the events of the first one. Take place in an apartment complex, and be somewhat based on a final showdown? Sounds like they got an amazing formula for this movie, it‚Äôs going to be fun!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAAAAAEEELLL
ek1ePFp-nBI,DAMN DUDE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love it it looks fantastic
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The last part of the trailer with the girl opening the closet door, should have been the iconic seen where he sticks the knife in the stomach and lifts her up, that would have been perfect bc him raising his knife is kinda ehh."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The kills in this movie are gonna be so intense I can‚Äôt wait!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Oh, Yes!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,THE STREETS. ARE NOT. READY!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am freaking excited... At long last a Halloween movie hopefully this will open doors for others classic horror franchises to get an appropriate sequel or remake
ek1ePFp-nBI,Boogeyman!! Boogeyman!! Who will be closing their closet door tonight?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like they did it RIGHT this time...We will see Oct. 19th then. The true¬†sequel? Time will tell.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The level of hype is unfuckingreal.
ek1ePFp-nBI,So happy that Halloween is back in 2018 ! Just praying October will come quickly so i can see this on the big screen ! Like I‚Äôm a Halloween Obsessed fan btwüòç watched the movies when I was at least 3 or 4 years old and it became my favourite movies of all time !
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yesssss the legend returnsüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
ek1ePFp-nBI,Big love from Russia)
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ohhhh that song!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Laurie Strode is just the best thing about this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"so a 60 year old man returns to kill the one that got away scary..this is gonna suck I'm out ..I know McBride has horror experience..I've seen eastbound and down,smh..but I'm sure carpenter executive producer this like Stan Lee executive produced infinity war..this is gonna blow"
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks perfect üëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So is this Halloween continuing from the second original movie(1981), where instead of that ending, they found michael‚Äôs body after the hospital explosion, and it turns out he is alive, and they bring him back to the asylum, and this movie continues from there, or does it continue the original first film(1978) where its not revealed that Michael is Laurie‚Äôs brother and disregards H4-resurrection? I grew up with Halloween, so I‚Äôve waited for this movie for a long time. Can‚Äôt wait for this!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I just peed a little
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love this franchise but this looks like a direct to video fan filmüòû. Hope im wrongüòØ
ek1ePFp-nBI,*THE DEVILS EYES*
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think they finally did Michael and this franchise Justice.  This looks amazing
ek1ePFp-nBI,The boogeyman is Back !!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:06 Silver Shamrock masks everyone!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Amazing üòé
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I've never really been the biggest fan of the Halloween series, but I'm so hyped about this movie! I'm gonna have to watch the first one tonight. üéÉüìº"
ek1ePFp-nBI,CANT WAIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:25 Michael Myers
ek1ePFp-nBI,‚ÄúHe‚Äôs waited for me. I‚Äôve waited for him.‚Äù We‚Äôve waited for this! ‚ô•Ô∏è üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,The Halloween sequel we've all been waiting for delivers the perfect trailer. TAKE. MY. MONEY.
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH HELLL YESSSS I GOT CHILLS!!))))
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I haven‚Äôt seen something so chilling since the first two films. Now this one being the direct sequel to the first, something J.C. approves and believes in..BRUH üò±So reminiscent to the first film. Watched this trailer 8 times and the chills are real. Gonna be a great movie, can‚Äôt wait to see it."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The trailer just came out and people already hating it üòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,oh  damn  i  was  waiting  for  this  movie  trailer  looks  great
ek1ePFp-nBI,OH ITS LIT
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE FUCKING AWSOME!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can‚Äôt wait to see this!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Got a bit emotional during this. Didn't expect that lol
ek1ePFp-nBI,Headbutting the bathroom stall door was fucking metal! \m/
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks great but a bit of a slap in the face to Halloween II, that sequel was at least half decent and still had Jamie Lee Curtis as OG Laurie Strode. It doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense that, if they are ignoring all the sequels, there would be such a legend built around this murderer who only killed 3 people 40 years ago. And it feels weird that now Laurie has been made into this super paranoid survivalist who planned for her random attacker from 40 years ago to come back? I dunno"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks amazing!  I wonder if anyone else caught this....in the scene at Smiths Grove, Michael is clearly bald (maybe Tony Moran will play him unmasked at one point in the movie?).  In the ""H20"" bathroom scene Michael clearly has hair.  If you pause the video you can tell he's unmasked and is bleeding on his forehead.  Also, he looks just like the British documentary film maker.  Check it out!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Are there going to call it the exact same title with original?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie ready this time
ek1ePFp-nBI,ﬂ∑
ek1ePFp-nBI,stop putting the mini teaser before the real one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,1:55 damnnn he look creepy
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks pretty awful
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Good to hear that good ol' Halloween Theme Music. And yes, Jamie Lee Curtis back as Laurie Strode."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This new Halloween movie going to be real bloody
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yo! I am so fucking pumped now!!! My childhood slasher hero is fucking back!!! Michael Myers baby! A little back story with me, when I was just six years old back like in 2005 or early 2006 I believe. The very first Halloween movie from 1978 came on TV one night. I watched it, and when I watched it I fell in love with the Micheal Myers  character and the whole horror slasher killer movies ever since! Micheal Myers is the reason why I also love Jason from Friday The 13th which makes them both my true slasher hero's! LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thank you god for not having Rob Zombie produce/direct this one, this looks like its going to be great"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ena GA da daily oru trailer release panrenga
ek1ePFp-nBI,IM SO HYPED FOR THIS KSJSBAINAKAN
ek1ePFp-nBI,Am I the only one who wanted to see him turn around and take the mask at the beginning?
ek1ePFp-nBI,The part looks like in a Scp containment breach
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:07 Halloween III masks! üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,*can anyone else see the little throwbacks to the other Halloween movies in this trailer?? the gas station! the toilet cubicle*
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Finally, a GOOD horror movie. Enough with the jump-scare boring shit!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Got my popcorn with me...
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last shot is fuuuuucked uuuup.  Awesome excited chills for this trailer and super pumped for this movie.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sequel To The Original Halloween Films, Sign Me Up Already."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks amazing!
ek1ePFp-nBI,WHO ELSE HAS BROKEN THE REPLAY BUTTON?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Watching this 49 minutes after release awesome
ek1ePFp-nBI,One Of The Most Iconic Sequels In History
ek1ePFp-nBI,Omg omg omg it took 40 years to get this right thank you John carpenter rest in peace Debra hill cause this trailer ROCKS....and thank u Jamie lee Curtis I feel the force very strongly about this one rob zombie look learn listen to the masters of this film ...thank u  thank u thank u just by this trailer alone it feels like 1978 again I'm an original 78 and 81 Halloween fan 1 and 2 are the classics now this one 456 stand on there own the rest has all been garbage...you hear me rob zombie your Halloween movies suck .. Thank u John carpenter r.i.p Debra hill and Jamie lee Curtis for this great finale and new classic it's going to become after I'm gone thank u thank u thank u ....A true original Halloween fan ...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Finally!!! A sequel in the franchise we deserve!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Ehh, it looks okay. Judging by the trailer dosent even compare to Rob Zombie's FIRST Film though. Still going to see it and hope for the best"
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG!!! He's back!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is allyson (Lauries granddaughter) wearing the same shirt as laurie from the first one at 02:08
ek1ePFp-nBI,FUCK YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,"The reasons he's after her is because she's the one that got away, he has unfinished business and he's mad that she's the one that got him locked up"
ek1ePFp-nBI,All the Halloween movies played on Halloween except this one
ek1ePFp-nBI,hell yeah!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Jamie Lee Curtis is SO BADASS
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Is this reboot for closure or a reboot that'll lead to more movies??? Either way im pumped, looks awesome!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,show üëèüëèüëè
ek1ePFp-nBI,Here early.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Beyond excited for a Halloween film that creates real tension isn't a B film. The original Halloween (and Halloween II) provides A level tension and deserves to be played every Halloween. This one has a chance!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"It's a shame we'll never see DGG's version of Suspiria, but this definitely makes up for it!!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Cult of Michael looks good
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks promising! I‚Äôm stoked to see the sequel to the original!
ek1ePFp-nBI,This actually looks good. Can't wait.
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck all the Zombie shittery, THIS loks like the real deal. Or at least something close to it, without disregarding the cult factor of the original. Bring it on!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm cumming!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,–ºŒ±‚àÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,not bad!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Just wait. This will be #1 on trending in an hour. Just wait

*Edit:* It took 10 hours instead, but I told you all it would be #1 trending."
ek1ePFp-nBI,The hype is fucking REAL!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Anyone else notice the blatant masonic occult symbolism @ 0:48. Masonic checkerfloor AND Michael Myers is standing on a yellow Square.  Yup, Michael still down with the Devil."
ek1ePFp-nBI,That piano had me thinking of Jurassic Park.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow üò±üò± it was superb üò±üëåüëå
ek1ePFp-nBI,You can‚Äôt kill him. He‚Äôs something else. Something not human.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The iconic theme of his just give the chills.
ek1ePFp-nBI,*Can't wait for the Bluray! I want a feature length documantary and atleast 2 audio commantaries!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:58 that music sounded like jurassic world
ek1ePFp-nBI,HES BACK
ek1ePFp-nBI,Damn. I hope this one is not shit like Jeepers Creepers 3 or something. Atleast I feel some kind of budget in this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is history in the making. Who knows if we will ever get another Halloween Trailer. I can't even take it in..
ek1ePFp-nBI,evil returns for blood on halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,Sequel to Halloween called.. Halloween
ek1ePFp-nBI,0:43 Gururumuz!! Adam king!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Is this a sequel?
ek1ePFp-nBI,HYPE
ek1ePFp-nBI,HOLY SHIT AMAZING !!!!!!!! YESSSSS
ek1ePFp-nBI,That looks incredible now can us unlucky English have the Halloween blu ray boxset plz!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG!!! Yasssss
ek1ePFp-nBI,good now all we need is a good Jason or Freddy reboot/sequel/remake/whatever the fuck it is and we'll be good
ek1ePFp-nBI,I DEMAND A RED BAND TRAILER
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wooow
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Weird theory, but I think that Strode is the actual killer this time... And it's all a hallucination/misdirection. 

IDK why, but that's the vibe I got."
ek1ePFp-nBI,2:36 probably a Prank and not the real Michael. Called it.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeeees Jamie Lee Curtis fuck him uuuup
ek1ePFp-nBI,"FUCK YES!!!!! I can't wait to capture the audience reactions for this!! I've been a fan since 1996 when I first saw it before H20 came. My older sister sat me down and said ""Ima show you something that will make you love horror movies"" Remind you I was only 6 years old. lmfao"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Gaaayyyeeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,Looks like they really ‚ÄúScrewed the pooch with this one‚Äù in my white guy voice
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I like it. Just please don't sequelbate it Universal. That's how we got Ressurection and look how that turned out. Unless your prepping a cinematic universe with  Freddy, Jason and so on, let Michael die and bring a proper closure to the franchise."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like it cuz the piano notes in the beginning remind me of jurassic park
ek1ePFp-nBI,His mask looks like a clown mask ü§£ü§£ü§£
ek1ePFp-nBI,The last scene when she tried to close the closet had me shook üéÉ
ek1ePFp-nBI,*BRING ON OCTOBER!!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,Anyone hoping if they make a sequel it‚Äôll be a remake of Halloween 3 I really wanna see John Carpenter‚Äôs original anthology idea brought to its full potential
ek1ePFp-nBI,Its heeerrreee and ive waited for months for this
ek1ePFp-nBI,I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Taking away Halloween 2 is the dumbest idea.. Halloween followed by Halloween 2 is a perfect duo for watching on Halloween night after handing out candy. This will never be as good. And michaels body count is really low to be worried about him for 40years after only one night. Why‚Äôs Michael going back for Laurie is she has no relation to her. Dumb
ek1ePFp-nBI,"""Miiiichaaaaeeel..."""
ek1ePFp-nBI,NOPE!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hoping for a Ronnie cameo
ek1ePFp-nBI,Best. Friday. Ever. The Scream Queen lives!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,When that theme kicked in...
ek1ePFp-nBI,That last scene gave me goosebumps. Like if u felt the same
ek1ePFp-nBI,"That knife twirl @2:04 tho, Michael Myers can only be played by Nick Castle"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Should have been called ""Halloween 2,"" ""Halloween"" implies it's a remake. Now we have three ""Halloween"" movies called ""Halloween"" (1978), (2007), (2018)."
ek1ePFp-nBI,Wow!!!!!! I have chills! üéÉüß°üß°üß°üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
ek1ePFp-nBI,WAAU CARPENTER RULES  BACK TO OLD SKUL  FUCK YEAH
ek1ePFp-nBI,Ben Tramer‚Äôs death will be avenged
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's baaaaack!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Oh my god! Im so excited right now
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This makes, what, five retcons this series has undergone now?"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Respect to the original man but those fucking teeth and the way the shot him putting his mask back on after all those years in chains god fucking goosebumps let alone the way they shot him in the recreational yard with the other patients and those savage German shepherd this movie is gonna be fucking nuts and I cannot wait any longer MY BIRTHDAY MONTH CAN YOU COME ANY FASTER BRING IT OUT ON ACTUAL HALLOWEEN üéÉ MY BIRTHDAY THAT WOULD BE MINT üî• this movie is gonna be brutal AF
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks stupid.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Can't wait YES
ek1ePFp-nBI,"How would you guys rank the franchise?
For me...
> 1 > 2 = 4 > 3 > 6 (producers cut) > 5 = h20 >> 6 (theatrical) > 2007 = 2009 >>> Resurrection"
ek1ePFp-nBI,*YES!*
ek1ePFp-nBI,The blackest eyes...
ek1ePFp-nBI,Rest in piece Donald pleasance. Thank god they aren't disrespecting his role like zombie did. I'm so glad john carpenter is back for this one.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Guess who‚Äôs back...back again...Laurie‚Äôs back...tell a friend
ek1ePFp-nBI,Holy fucking shit
ek1ePFp-nBI,"i believe in Boogeyman
(Baba yaga)"
ek1ePFp-nBI,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,THIS IS AMAZING IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR A SEQUEL AHHHHHH
ek1ePFp-nBI,"well, look who's back from the dead......"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who wants it to be rated R ?
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why not just get someone like Martyn ford to play the actor who‚Äôs 6‚Äô8 he much better and a complete bodybuilding tank.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is just as bad if not worse as The Predator trailer.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Who loved the team songüòç?
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Halloween
Halloween 2
Halloween"
ek1ePFp-nBI,VIVAAAAAAAAA A MINHA FRANQUIA T√Å VIVAAA

ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks great, only thing that looks better is Michael‚Äôs mask"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"FINALMENTEEEEEEEEEE, MICHAEL E LAURIE EU VENERO VOC√äS"
ek1ePFp-nBI,üôÇüôÉ let's go!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm Michael Myers, I kill careers and cut the lights off the shit is frightening‚Äù"
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck. Yes.  It just FEELS like Halloween.  Nick Castle returning as The Shape,  John Carpenter doing the score (and executive producing), and kids trick-or- treating.  This is going to be SO GOOD."
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Fuck yeah, I can't wait until October 19th"
ek1ePFp-nBI,They said he only murdered 3 people? What about everyone in the hospital on the SAME NIGHT?!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"By the end of the day, this will be trending.

Edited: Call it!"

_You should"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Such a lack of respect for us fans.
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks LIT and Spooky
ek1ePFp-nBI,What a wonderful day!! 1. Its Friday. 2. Waking up with wood. 3. Seeing this!!! Today was a good day!

ek1ePFp-nBI,130 days ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
ek1ePFp-nBI,Why do I hear the theme to Jurassic Park?  Haha.  0:50
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yeee
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael ain‚Äôt the only one that‚Äôs been waiting, IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR YEARS!!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,Thank god John carpenter is back
ek1ePFp-nBI,"So that's the official title? Just Halloween? If it's a sequel then why not just call it like ""Halloween Returns"" or something"
ek1ePFp-nBI,It's awsome to hear that soundtrack again
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks badass!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I think that is BS. There is no reason why we the public didn't get this 2 months ago. No explanation as for the pointless 2 month wait. Classless Blumhouse/Universal.
ek1ePFp-nBI,It‚Äôs probably just Busta Rhymes under that mask playing a prank on usüòÇüòÇüòÇ
ek1ePFp-nBI,I'm glad to hear that huge Halloween fans actor Danny McBride & Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green get to write the film. Now this will be a true continuation to the 1978 film. üé•üòä
ek1ePFp-nBI,I like how they implemented the brother and sister but was a rumor so yeah they ain‚Äôt siblings and he wants to get revenge on her because he got locked!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Mike Myers was my favorite in Wayne's World and Cat in the Hat. I can't wait for his new movie!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hope the studio takes the same care and quality as with this film that looks very good with the fnaf movie coming soon
ek1ePFp-nBI,This is gonna be sick!!!  can't wait to piss and shit myself simultaneously in the movie theater seats!
ek1ePFp-nBI,Yes yes yes yes yes !!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"This looks to be awesome. The mask is right, the feel is right, the characters are right.....time to rock."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks so good!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,RIP Dr loomis!! ‚Äú you don‚Äôt know what death is‚Äù
ek1ePFp-nBI,Hate to say it but it looks stupid. Not as stupid as the others but stupid. I have a feeling I'll just have to do my own editing with the first 2 movies and that's where it ends. Like the original STAR WARS trilogy is all that matters.
ek1ePFp-nBI,The toilet scene is exactly like the one from h20
ek1ePFp-nBI,He's home!!!!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I was a bit concerned about this at first but after this trailer, I find that it does look and feel like a ‚ÄòHalloween‚Äô movie."
ek1ePFp-nBI,I love the franchise well the whole Halloween series but why the hell are you going to ruin the story / background of a classic like this. Will still see the movie because I have always been a huge Halloween fan plus it must be good for a John Carpenter to have helped reboot a classic.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Fuck. Yes!
ek1ePFp-nBI,I wish the trailer started off with the begging of the theme it would have given me chills
ek1ePFp-nBI,MICHAEL FUCKING MYERS !!!!!!

ek1ePFp-nBI,I‚Äôm not terribly impressed yet; feel like I‚Äôve seen all of this before.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Honestly they better not pull an h20/Resurrection by killing off Michael and then bringing him back in another sequel with some story on how he faked his death.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Laurie has gone full on Linda Hamilton which is awesome. though some of it looks like a rehash of the original with elements from other halloween sequels but ive met jamie lee curtis in 1998 flew to chicago just to meet her as an 18th birthday present from my parents and love her character so much! so most def will i go and see this.
ek1ePFp-nBI,Since this is trailer released 2 MONTHS AGO at Cinemacon...WHY did we have to wait 2 pointless months to see it? Real classy Blumhouse/Universal!
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Not excited about ignoring the sequels , but its Michael Myers on the big screen again.Just in the trailer you can see a nod to Halloween 4 when hes in the car shop and Halloween H2O with the lady in the bathroom, except this time Michael doesnt just want her car keys it looks like..."

ek1ePFp-nBI,Awesome trailer
ek1ePFp-nBI,I truly hope slasher movies make a mainstream comeback after this gets released and storms the box office. The audience in the theatre is gonna go off when the soundtrack begins and intro credits roll.
ek1ePFp-nBI,wow
ek1ePFp-nBI,"I did not like this trailer, i fucking LOVED it!"
ek1ePFp-nBI,I am literally shaking. Carpenter's '78 movie is my favourite film of all time and these guys look like they have completely respected that original. So happy.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Michael (aka the shape) is genuinely creepy , At first I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of them ignoring h2 but Then I realized they already did a direct sequel to the first 2 movies H20 now it makes a bit more sense to just make a continuation of the first film ."

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Thank goodness they got rid of most of the stuff that came after the first one. The whole story of her being his sister and then the cult, it just got ridiculous. This looks like a proper sequel."
ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks INCREDIBLE! Leave it to Blumhouse to bring it back to its core. They get it. This is everything fans deserved. It captures everything the original two had in terms of style and tone. I'm so excited for this.

Laurie Strode is alive because this takes place after the 1978 movie. It's a direct sequel to the original. None of the other movies matter here. They're making it that Michael was captured that night, 40 years ago, and he's been in prison ever since.

This is going to change some of the mythos of the story. Him being this type of supernatural immortal being is gone, along with him being Laurie's brother."

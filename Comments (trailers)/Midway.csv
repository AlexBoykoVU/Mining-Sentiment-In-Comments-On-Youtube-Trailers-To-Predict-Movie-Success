l9laReRAYFk,Gosh damnit.
l9laReRAYFk,Please no social justice revisionism or innuendo.
l9laReRAYFk,Please stop hating !!!!! The cgi isn't bad. This is the best cgi to make it look realistic. And by the way this movie is lit🔥🔥
l9laReRAYFk,"sorry, but you F*cked it up.  everyone, just watch restored film documentaries instead."
l9laReRAYFk,They better have Midway from sabaton playing
l9laReRAYFk,"MY Gosh, the trailer looks like a video game, or worse, a cartoon interspersed with staged acting with real actors.  It looks terrible."
l9laReRAYFk,CG CG CG CG CG
l9laReRAYFk,Add about 7k Japanese posters and we hit negative. We didn’t pick a fight with u folks. U did and we fought.
l9laReRAYFk,"hey Folks,just it seems like Pearl Harbour film? Holy cow ..Don't you think it's worth seeing it?"
l9laReRAYFk,It looks like Hürkuş movie
l9laReRAYFk,"Soldier:  What kind of music I must hear to win ? 
Sabaton:  Yes"
l9laReRAYFk,"The battle that saw Japan lose 4 carriers: Hiryu, Soryu, Kaga and Akagi."
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like america is trying to justify Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Totally Shit..
l9laReRAYFk,ED SKREIN LUKE EVANS NICK JONAS DARREN CRISS MANDY MOORE WOODY HARRELSON  AARON ECKHART LUKE KLEINTANK KEEAN JOHNSON DENNIS QUAID & PATRICK WILSON
l9laReRAYFk,Theo Lynnea reason I would watch it would be for woody Harrelson
l9laReRAYFk,Why we have to keep dredging up the past so that we stay angry at what has happened in the past rather than moving on and changing the future. two👎👎 thumbs down to your stupid remake movie it's a damn shame it happened but it did and it's done..... you just can't think of anything else to make...💥
l9laReRAYFk,I imaging this will be uncomfortable for Japanese viewers... though based on the trailer the Japanese are likely just a nebulous bogeyman.
l9laReRAYFk,Anyone else thinks this movie looks cringy? Complete respect the battle and history but this movie just makes me cringe
l9laReRAYFk,the new world of warships trailer looks great
l9laReRAYFk,CGI looks terrible.
l9laReRAYFk,"This is huge,straight from the gates of lions"
l9laReRAYFk,2:06 thats not how planes work
l9laReRAYFk,It's probably cheaper to pop by the local market and buy some Cheez Whiz there.
l9laReRAYFk,A few men? 🤔
l9laReRAYFk,Love it
l9laReRAYFk,"Just watched it like 5 munites ago, it's a nice movie and the trailer is just a little fraction of the movie."
l9laReRAYFk,"sigh, the movie has not opened yet but it gets 30% on Rotten Tomatoes........................."
l9laReRAYFk,I'm gonna watch this tomorrow.
l9laReRAYFk,It's very nice movie.. I❤️it..
l9laReRAYFk,We did all that for California? I bet Japan wouldn't even take that shit hole for free now.
l9laReRAYFk,Animal cookies again?
l9laReRAYFk,I can’t believe this is being released theatrically.  I thought for sure it was straight to video.
l9laReRAYFk,"CGI carrier, CGI plane, CGI flightdeck (no smoke from the aircraft exhaust, no buffeting from the props, the crew is walking casually on the deck amid planes with spinning propellers.  Looks like a cheap made for TV movie. Heck Battlestar Galactica's flightdeck was more realistic than this"
l9laReRAYFk,"This movie will hopefully be historically accurate and also a big entertaining Hollywood movie like Michael bays Pearl harbor, I'm going to see this very soon"
l9laReRAYFk,2:06 - Hehe
l9laReRAYFk,Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor or Roland Emmerich's Midway?
l9laReRAYFk,This is a Battlefield campaign trailer lol
l9laReRAYFk,"YOU BETTER MAKE THIS MOVIE RIGHT!!!... NO MORE CGI B.S. AND CUTE BOYS WITH TIGHT ASSES PORTRAYING COMMANDERS AND BEING BAD BOYS FLYING BETWEEN THE EYE OF A NEEDLE STAR WARS CRAP!!!!... I'M SO HAD IT WITH THAT NONSENSE!!!!  
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE SPENCER TRACY'S, JOHN BENDIX'S, BRIAN DONLEAVY'S, LEE MARVIN'S, ROBERT MITCHUM'S, WHERE ARE THEY??
REAL ACTORS!! 
LET ME REMIND TO ALL YOU MOVIE MAKERS THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO KNOW WW2 HISTORY!!!.. AND KNOW IT WELL!!
DON'T GLORIFY THE ACTORS PLEASE!!!
HONOR THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE AND THE GREATEST GENERATION!!!"
l9laReRAYFk,Cool can't wait to play this game on my xbox one.  Love the throw back to first gen graphics.
l9laReRAYFk,Another instants where White America tries to make you think that they were the only one's to fight in WWII. 💩
l9laReRAYFk,"And now this stupid chinese goverment invading the whole south china sea and build military bases,  hope they learn from this movie.. No one would win,  peace is the only key. ."
l9laReRAYFk,"Lisää skeidaa,miten mahtavat ja voittamattomat jenkit on...."
l9laReRAYFk,"Give me the old 1976 Midway film ANY DAY and any OLD war film. I detest these new war films that rely heavily on computer graphics. I loved looking at the old ones that actually had the aircraft that were real, they used actual footage. Told the story exactly how it was, not like these modern day crap ones where there's a soppy love story or over dramatised. Pearl harbour was just like that, not much action but that stupid love triangle. 

But then again, people who either don't know the importance of this battle or are ignorant to it need the story told to them and in ways they'll understand."
l9laReRAYFk,Why does it look so sci fi? Feels like watching a terminator trailer
l9laReRAYFk,"This is the history of america philippines and japan where japan mocks like american to go to the open city, manila and they planned it to destroy the pearl harbor japan make america to surrender, america surrender the philippines 
But gen douglas macarthur once said to the filipinos
""I shall return"""
l9laReRAYFk,"I'm really surprised they made this movie. Kids today don't give two craps about what the greatest generation in America did. I bet if you asked half of them what what Midway, they probably say its some subway sandwhich."
l9laReRAYFk,"World of Warships ""B"" team made a movie?"
l9laReRAYFk,"Seeing Darren Criss's name up there, it's like I'm seeing my baby all grown up."
l9laReRAYFk,"Why are planes so low, like, all of these planes would be shot down in an instant if it got too close with AA. I'm not saying I'm an expert, but these planes should have stayed high up even when they're trying to bomb (well except if those were torpedoes). Welp, f*ck realism and let's just get on to the story anyway."
l9laReRAYFk,Why are they so many white people in this movie ????
l9laReRAYFk,"Breathtaking trailer 🤩, is it coming out on PC as well or is it PS4 exclusive ?"
l9laReRAYFk,Lions gate is a tool of the military industrial complex. Why are US taxpayers paying for this movie to be made? Military propaganda is disgusting.
l9laReRAYFk,"I just saw this today November 6, 2019 at first showing day Wednesday 11am in Cinema and it's a perfect movie! One of the best war movie!
Thank you America for the Freedom you gave the world by ending World War ll !
Thank you for producing this film!
See you in 2022 for the Battle in Philippine Sea!
🤜🤛🙏💓"
l9laReRAYFk,"I saw the movie last night. It was intense and eventful. Though i'm not a fan of ""battle movies"" I love this film."
l9laReRAYFk,Banzai
l9laReRAYFk,Iam exited from the movie😀
l9laReRAYFk,My battlefield graphics are better than this. RTX2070ti.
l9laReRAYFk,Similar types of movie name anybody
l9laReRAYFk,Communications of panicked pilots
l9laReRAYFk,Where was Optimus Prime?
l9laReRAYFk,This looks like mainstream Hollywood garbage
l9laReRAYFk,"I take it this is the Marvel comic book version of the naval war in the Pacific.  Correct?  


It looks even sillier than that turkey 'Pearl Harbor"" they came out with a few years back."
l9laReRAYFk,its a video game? Looks like it.
l9laReRAYFk,I’ll be turning 14
l9laReRAYFk,"The best part about this movie is that I love this movie and it comes out on my Birthday my birthday is November 8th,2019"
l9laReRAYFk,The TOP GUN MAVERICK trailer is better than this entire movie.
l9laReRAYFk,"The dialogue in this trailer makes me think it might not be such a good film.  Seems it may use the standard Hollywood formula and not a focus on the history. ""A bridge too far"", now there is a great movie."
l9laReRAYFk,Looks a little cheesy and to much cgi. I just watched Danger close movie about the Australians fighting  in Long tan in the Vietnam war its superb..
l9laReRAYFk,Too much CG. not a Movie. like a some kind of pc games. old midway is BEST!  .... from seoul
l9laReRAYFk,I don't really like the tone of this. So Hollywood and fake. Lacks any atmosphere.
l9laReRAYFk,"Always open to new history films but Hollywood do love to ramp it up. I just hope there is no love stories, no over the top heroism, no one man running through all the hails of bullets and surviving malarky. CGI has gone to pot these days everything looks OTT and too fake. Who even directed it anyways..."
l9laReRAYFk,"✔️ Lame-ass bass drop. 
✔️ American wanking
✔️ Glorifying war
✔️ Unnecessary pop star actor
✔️ 1-sided view of the battle
✔️ bomb-drop shot from Pearl Harbour


Yup, Hollywood shitfest. Congrats, execs."
l9laReRAYFk,The CGI is so bad
l9laReRAYFk,"Women cry to Titanic
Men cry to Terminator 2
Army cry to this (Midway)"
l9laReRAYFk,"As the events in Naval History during WWII tells us - Battle of Midway (1942) was the turning point in War in the Pacific. US Navy had won a decisive Victory despite being hopelessly outnumbered by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Jap Imperial Fleet compromised of a sizeable enemy Task Force - 4 Aircraft Carriers battleships Cruisers destroyers n submarines. Those Carriers had attacked Pearl Harbour on Dec 7th 1941. US Navy Task Force comprised of only 3 Aircraft Carriers Cruisers and destroyers.

After Peral Harbour n Coral Sea it was Midway. It was USS YORKTOWN ENTERPRISE & HORNET  V/s AKAGI KAGA SORYU & HIRYU. The Trailer seems exciting n the movie is War & Action Drama based on true War Story. Lookin forward for its release. Respects from myself n Indian Navy to the Mighty US Navy."
l9laReRAYFk,Making f*cking disaster porn out of real-life events... I hope Lionsgate loses a fortune on this.
l9laReRAYFk,"War thunder full trailer 2019, 1080p"
l9laReRAYFk,Wow look at all that CGI nothing getting blown around all over the screen. Looks so fake I almost laughed.
l9laReRAYFk,Dropped as soon as I saw Indepedence Day. Fuck this shit
l9laReRAYFk,"アメリカは、日本人には勝てても、中国人には勝てないぞ
2050年には、ロサンゼルスとサンフランシスコは、中国の領土だろうね
アメリカの時代は終わったんだよ"
l9laReRAYFk,someone must die from G-force shock
l9laReRAYFk,🇺🇸🍁🇺🇸WE WON🇺🇸🔥🇺🇸
l9laReRAYFk,"This..... this CGI, oh boy............. I dont know about this one.    :|"
l9laReRAYFk,is dis The midway that they said the philipines help to bring peace?
l9laReRAYFk,"Looks like the Transformers does WWII. An utter Michael bay-esque shitfest of CGI, explosions and of course a love interest thrown in because what war movie doesn't need that, right? This is what I expect from Hollywood anyway. Far and few between are movies like Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Tora Tora Tora. As someone mentioned in the comments what else should we expect from someone who directed Independence Day and Day After Tomorrow. Emmerich should be ashamed."
l9laReRAYFk,This movie looks mainly animated but still want to see it
l9laReRAYFk,"OK I FUCKING GET I NEED TO SEE THIS, CAN YOU *PLEASE* FUCK OFF!"
l9laReRAYFk,Came here after playing and watching Azur Lane
l9laReRAYFk,I'm ten right now but when I'm older I'll join the *Air* *Force*
l9laReRAYFk,Gilaaaqq
l9laReRAYFk,"I got to ask: Who is the boy band fan faggot who keeps putting a One Direction faggot into War movies?

I'll pirate it, thanks for the free movie Lionsgate!"
l9laReRAYFk,The new Battlefield V war in the pacific trailer
l9laReRAYFk,god dammit.....when do the hollywood will give us an a movie where both side tell their story
l9laReRAYFk,تمام
l9laReRAYFk,The might of IJN & the bravery of the Americans..Salute! Because the success of Midway we got our independence..tq America. History to remember.
l9laReRAYFk,"I wonder if we asked the great men who fought at Midway and all the WWII battlefields, what they would think of the US today with cultural incoherence, social decay, misandry, and anti-white “diversity”? Would they have sacrificed knowing now what this disappearing nation has become?"
l9laReRAYFk,You Will never faced anything
l9laReRAYFk,On 1:34 my heart was like aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh. Darren criss hahahaha
l9laReRAYFk,I just saw this movie in an advanced screening and it is one of the most incredible war I have ever seen. I was so very impressed how they cast actors that actually look liked the people they are acting like in the movie. This movie does not dishonor either side who fought in this battle and that was a very nice surprise. I am unable to find words strong enough to say how this movie honor those who fought and died for us. Go See what happened in this battle that changed everything.
l9laReRAYFk,"The lack of good CGI amazes me sometimes! The explosions in Pearl Harbor looked better than these ones do (not much better, but better, and that was 18 years ago)!"
l9laReRAYFk,You save the philippines thanks USA  😇😇😇😇😇
l9laReRAYFk,"If it doesn’t have or mention General Clarence Tinker, this movie will be crap just like Pearl Harbor."
l9laReRAYFk,I mean im just gonna be honest... it looks like CGI garbage.
l9laReRAYFk,The vets are spinning in their graves like the kamikazes that killed them seeing this piece of cgi dogshit
l9laReRAYFk,Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn!
l9laReRAYFk,"The CGI animation is horrible but... It's a war movie based in truly events, fuck i will go to see"
l9laReRAYFk,Spoiler Alert!
l9laReRAYFk,"YES FINALLY AN UP TO DATE MIDWAY MOVIE, I FUCKING LOVE NAVAL WARFARE AND I FINALLY GET MIDWAY, THIS IS A GREAT YEAR, TIME FOR THE GRAY GHOST TO SINK THE 1st CARRIER DIVISION!!!"
l9laReRAYFk,"Far from shore, a Pacific war Bombs are falling from the skies It's a bomb-run day, it's the naval way A blood-red sun is on the rise"
l9laReRAYFk,"Why are we making these kind of patriotic hero movies ?  Anyway, it’s basically another show reel for the special fx Depts. 
😴"
l9laReRAYFk,"Am I the only one that thinks this is pure propaganda and sponsored by the USA government to support the idea they were the ""hero""?
I'm from the Philippines and our company just recently went to their historical military base in the Corregidor island. It only took them around 2 years to establish a very strategic and well-put defenses on the island which means they long gone prepared for this war.
The Japanese weren't after us but only for their American enemies. The Japanese won the first war. There are only few American soldiers captured compared to the Filipinos who just happened to be living near that doomed island. The infamous Bataan Death march followed which took several thousand lives of my country men.
All this happened after the American colonized our country. To this day, I am still in awe at their extreme lack of understanding of the situation, thinking we should be thankful to them while in fact, they were the one who brought chaos to our country. They are still trying to imprint to everyone's head that they are the hero who saves everyone from the enemies."
l9laReRAYFk,"Wow the new BF5 Pacific expansion looks pretty good... (ugh this is what makes me appreciate movies like Dunkirk who did a real effort of realistic airplane scenes with almost no CGI, and no douchebag pilots yelling every second)"
l9laReRAYFk,"When are they going to make a movie about how America brings ""democracy"" to other countries?😂 And how it saves oil fields from terrorists🙃"
l9laReRAYFk,"The Japanese had no plans of invading the US mainland,  even if they had won at midway. Ridiculous."
l9laReRAYFk,"Well I hope the final version has better effects beauase Tora, Tora, Tora looks better from 1970."
l9laReRAYFk,*FAR FROM SHORE A PACIFIC WAR BOMBS ARE DROPPING FROM THE SKYS*
l9laReRAYFk,It's the Medal of Honor: Rising Sun hd remake for PS4
l9laReRAYFk,Pearl Harbor (movie) was good and all but this is good
l9laReRAYFk,at 2:05 did he just cut off the fuel mixture and set it to full rich again instead of using the throttle to do that?
l9laReRAYFk,CGI is like battlefield
l9laReRAYFk,OMG I have to see this!!
l9laReRAYFk,"Thanks lionsgate!
Great movie, can't wait to see what you make next."
l9laReRAYFk,Thank you white guys and that one explicitly stated minority but still looks white.
l9laReRAYFk,That moment when pearl harbors CGI looks much realistic than this piece of shit.
l9laReRAYFk,Woody Harrelson
l9laReRAYFk,Soundtrack to this should be battlefield 1943
l9laReRAYFk,They should mention this is a fiction not real history 😁
l9laReRAYFk,Yeah-another1 american propaganda movie...
l9laReRAYFk,"You can board the Midway Carrier in Downtown San Diego Waterfront...Get there early ,it will be loaded with people"
l9laReRAYFk,"Looked amazing however, 1 Question, I saw Japanese regular Bombers in the clip. WTF?"
l9laReRAYFk,Pearl Harbor Chapter 2?
l9laReRAYFk,Send them over the waves
l9laReRAYFk,Pumped for this
l9laReRAYFk,Sorry for copying eragon movie highlights thank you
l9laReRAYFk,"Japan : **Attacks Midway**
U.S. : * Im About To End This Man Whole -Career- Carrier *"
l9laReRAYFk,What's up with all these stupid ass boring actors??
l9laReRAYFk,No one gonna talk about 2:10 dauntless cant do that
l9laReRAYFk,hoooooooraaaaah can't wait for this
l9laReRAYFk,"What history doesn’t say, will be part of this film.  But I don’t think it will cover how an abandoned mini sub was found two weeks prior to Pearl Harbor; ‘Hilo News’ erased from history."
l9laReRAYFk,This looks like a good movie I wonder what will be like in 3-D
l9laReRAYFk,I do believe in Peace from within
l9laReRAYFk,"Roland Emmerich is a great director (the guy that directed Independence Day),  the actors he chose are all well known. Especially choosing Harrelson as Nimitz and Evans as Mcclusky, smart move. The only thing that worries me is the historical accuracy Roland is going to put in Midway. Since Pearl Harbor (2001), Hollywood and the historical content is similar with mixing water with oil. I hope that Roland and  other great historical shows kill off this trend for good. I honestly don't give two sh!ts whether the CGI is at its best or  what it was 5 years ago. GCI alone is fucking expensive, and I would appreciate a well written, S tier story   for Midway. Lets be honest, It would be pretty shitty for Hollywood to turn one of the greatest naval battles in history into a dumpster fire just for a few blokes complaining about DUH GAPHICS! PEACE
disclaimer (don't take this seriously, this comment is mostly based on my biased opinions. enjoy the show lads)"
l9laReRAYFk,Azure lane pvp lol
l9laReRAYFk,"The CGI looks awful it looks straight out of a world of warships short



Hell I think world of warships have better Effects than this"
l9laReRAYFk,Gonna be kick ass film 🇺🇸
l9laReRAYFk,You know a movie is going to be good when they pull a fucking red tails maneuver in the  trailer.
l9laReRAYFk,Bullshit looking like hacksaw ridge with planes
l9laReRAYFk,"the diving of the dauntless in the end resume perfectly the movie.... fake, stupid, irrealistic!"
l9laReRAYFk,Too bad they are only going to use  RC planes instead of real ones
l9laReRAYFk,"Arg. I have loved a number of WW2 movies, but honestly. What's up with all the CGI? Also, if you're going to use a Star Wars-like trailer can you please learn something about CGI like their franchise did?"
l9laReRAYFk,This CGI hurts my eyes so bad
l9laReRAYFk,It still sad to think that there are many Filipinos murdered and died because of this war 😞 yet we Filipinos doesn't show any hatred eventually most of us carried love and cherish them. 😔
l9laReRAYFk,Trump supporters are scary
l9laReRAYFk,"Look all this morrons saying CGI is ugly......in 2019, you will never have final shots in trailers (unless the final trailer maybe but not sure)."
l9laReRAYFk,These men were some of the greatest heroes in American history. Who knows what all of our lives would look like today had the Japanese succeeded in gaining that major foothold in the Pacific. This was the battle that put the Japanese on the defensive for the rest of the war.
l9laReRAYFk,La is burning looks like they lost and isn't it beautiful. Fucker's nuked innocent women and kids for a some 42 people who knew the consequence of war
l9laReRAYFk,"""If we lose, the Japanese will own the West Coast."" Uh... no.   The Japanese had zero plans to invade the U.S."
l9laReRAYFk,"Too much cgi, fuck"
l9laReRAYFk,Hmmm.. now where have a seen this before? A movie where two fly boys have to fight unbeatable odds to save the world of America. One pilot is the cocky experienced fighter with a beautiful wife who begs of him to take a younger and less skilled nervous boy under his wing to protect him. Then there's a love triangle where the lovely wife becomes fund of the younger fly boy but yet the experienced cocky pilot saves the younger pilot from certain death and leads his men to victory. Oh brave America you've done it again! *Yawn*
l9laReRAYFk,"Meh, can't be that bad.

""From the director of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow.""

DONE!"
l9laReRAYFk,"To be sensitive to the Japanese, I hear they are replacing all of the Imperial forces with Ewoks. They fly the Japanese Zeroes and everything. :)"
l9laReRAYFk,Is this movie for kids or not???
l9laReRAYFk,I came from ads ph and us are fight on Japanese
l9laReRAYFk,"Japan looked for decisive victory, they received one. haha"
l9laReRAYFk,😂😂😂
l9laReRAYFk,0:14-0:17 Looks like it's from a computer game ...?
l9laReRAYFk,The sbd wasent supposed to dive until pulling off super close to the Japanese aircraft carrier not realistic
l9laReRAYFk,"Untold true events
Yeah, I’m sure this isn’t something you haven’t made up
Sure this whole movie isn’t to spread a narrative"
l9laReRAYFk,Biggest intelligence failure in -American- history
l9laReRAYFk,Untold story my ass there's already a movie about midway probably 400x more realistic and so many historians have told it so shut up
l9laReRAYFk,Spoilers! 5 carries will sink!
l9laReRAYFk,Ive never seen ed skrein with hair but it looks nice tho
l9laReRAYFk,"This isn't an historical movie, this is a rape that destroy the memory of the real battle of midway"
l9laReRAYFk,Fuck off with the propaganda 🖕🏿
l9laReRAYFk,"At this point, this is nothing more than new age propaganda. This genre of movies/shows needs to end. This is something that can be learned about and doesn't need to be relived, recounted, or re-enacted anymore than it already has. All Hollywood is doing is yet ANOTHER reboot. 
""Oh man, we've run out of ideas for good movies Rick, how can we make something that people will want to watch, I don't really want to do another movie like this."" 
""Listen *burp* here Morty, you little piece of shit. People want this garbage, it makes them feel right. They think that if they can demon-*buuuuuuuuuuurp* demonize a whole culture who's grandparents were doing what they thought was right, they'll feel better about themselves. But here, here's *burp*, here's the kicker Morty!!! They're all fucking wrong, every last one of them. They're all a bunch of animals feeding into the nonsensical idea that the writers of history are always right! So shut up, edit the clips of the cotton field and lets make some mother fucking money!""
""Uhh, Rick, this is a World War II movie?""
""Shit, really? Oh well, fuck it, make the movie anyway."""
l9laReRAYFk,I was hoping that Emmerich would find another angle of making films. It seems that I was wrong. Hard to see that there would be another film of this battle ever again. What a waste. I might go to see this (if it makes to theaters in Finland which I doubt) but it is going to feel wrong to spend my money on this.
l9laReRAYFk,"日本人も全員見よう!
おもしろそう！"
l9laReRAYFk,"Oh great! Another corny-ass, unrealistic Hollywood film that overdramatizes literally everything and makes servicemen look like a bunch of cartoon characters with a totally forced, overdone plot of some kid ""trying to prove himself"" with a romantic substory. I bet all the veterans who fought at Midway and are no longer with us are rolling in their graves."
l9laReRAYFk,This movie is weird because there is no nazi 😡
l9laReRAYFk,I personally love the CGI but some of the scenes were really off that it almost looks cartoony
l9laReRAYFk,I like to see Titanic 3
l9laReRAYFk,We're going to throw a punch so they know what it feels like to get hit!!! God I miss the Good ol Days! Proud Son of an Island Hopper WWII...Miss you Pop!
l9laReRAYFk,Make it rain
l9laReRAYFk,Didn’t they have an episode about this in supernatural?
l9laReRAYFk,"Yankee shouldn’t get full of yourself even if lucky shot, It was just lucky."
l9laReRAYFk,"Not a Stargate movie...  Oh. Oh..ooooh

Sound track : the Middle ft: Swift"
l9laReRAYFk,THIS battle changed the  WORLD
l9laReRAYFk,Back when we were the good guys.
l9laReRAYFk,"Oh their gonna butcher it. 
The Admiral Fletcher is gonna be in a homosexual love triangle with Nimitz and Spruance. 
The Japanese will be heroes fighting to save themselves from the A-bomb. 
A whole squadron of pilots will be African Americans, despite the fact the Navy’s first Black fighter pilot enlisted in 1946 (he was a real hero, and killed in action in 1950 in Korea). 
The codebreaker’s wife will the one who actually cracks the Japanese code.
“Experience the Battle of Midway as it really happened” in some liberal Hollywood director’s fantasy."
l9laReRAYFk,"Now: is battle of midway
Up next : battle of philippine sea 

The battle changes everything"
l9laReRAYFk,"Oh man, you guys suck. You could have done real craft and real stunts, but it's just another Red Tails, Green Screen piece of garbage. You're gonna make an SBD skip its wing off the water?? REALLY?!? That stupid tail-stall shot where the plane has zero inertia and barely misses some enemy plane? Yeah, get that crap out of here; there are so many things wrong with just that one scene it's not even worth laying out. I'll pay to see something with effort put in, something where you blow up remote controlled planes and boats, but I absolutely refuse to watch this horseshit packed with absurd stunts and improbably-close-calls."
l9laReRAYFk,"This movie lacked the ability to use the real macoys that they overly used green screens and CGI.
Add that to the cast of, well lets say WRONG ACTORS for the parts they play.

And being supplied with the knowledge over the years by the movie industry on how they create these things,  for me, it just ruins the movies now.
 Even the trailer was ridiculous to watch."
l9laReRAYFk,Cool game............   Oh wait!
l9laReRAYFk,*You've got a hole in your right wing!*
l9laReRAYFk,What is this World of Warships X Battlefield collaboration CG?
l9laReRAYFk,There is already a Midway movie and it is pretty damn good
l9laReRAYFk,Pretty surprising it's not directed by Micheal Bay.
l9laReRAYFk,"Welp, we already see the main character with a women so we know where this is going and I am pretty statistically the flak should have hit 3 or 4 SBD Dauntless Bombers. The fight scene looks like footage from World of Warships trailers"
l9laReRAYFk,People really don't understand how significant this battle really was!
l9laReRAYFk,"Pearl harbor....
 all I'm gonna say..."
l9laReRAYFk,"Enfim,um bom filme para se ver em 2019..."
l9laReRAYFk,"Scrolled though the comments. 99% of all comments arr hate, and now i will say that im pretty excidet for this movie. And btw the sceene when he jumps on a sbd divebomber and shoots a bomber down, it did happen."
l9laReRAYFk,WE'LL MEET AT MIDWAY
l9laReRAYFk,"Not as good as World of Warships who did the video for Sabatons ""Bismarck"". You would believe the Bismarck is real in that video. After all, they have all the models done in 3D ready format. Quite why the production company didn't use the WOWS models and expertise is beyond me."
l9laReRAYFk,Wow the cgi.... it’s so shit.
l9laReRAYFk,We already got this movie in 1976 the story has been told nobody can replace Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda
l9laReRAYFk,Exchange ratio
l9laReRAYFk,Remember that these movies are made to make $$$$$$$$$$$ not to memorialize the participants.
l9laReRAYFk,This looks like trash but I'll still go see it. I'll let y'all know afterwards.
l9laReRAYFk,Time to watch Montemayor’s analysis instead. That just looks awful.
l9laReRAYFk,YOU’VE GOT A HOLE IN YOUR RIGHT WING
l9laReRAYFk,"No matter how good the CGI is, this movie will not top the original 1976 ""Midway"". It had quality acting and real war footage. CGI not required. I will not be seeing this 2019 crap."
l9laReRAYFk,this look pretty amazing actualy!
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like a video game.
l9laReRAYFk,I cannot wait for this to come out on dvd.
l9laReRAYFk,Well the level of courage is also proportional to the level alcohol is tolerated during operations.
l9laReRAYFk,"So fucking cheesy and melodramatic it hurts, it's like a caricature or parody."

l9laReRAYFk,My Dad's War.....1944..........Hope its not another Pearl Harbor.........Movie..........sitting through 3 hours of Love Story ......
l9laReRAYFk,BANZAI!!!
l9laReRAYFk,This movie looks spectacular.
l9laReRAYFk,Please don't fuck this up.
l9laReRAYFk,No love stories in it ...please !  no love stories in it … at least ...not too much … please ! Oh ...no Ben Affleck ...fiou...
l9laReRAYFk,More foreigners playing American hero’s. Sad
l9laReRAYFk,I miss japan.. 😭
l9laReRAYFk,"I feel tempted to see it, but I know Hollywood will change the story for dramatic affect. It is sad too because the guys that fought this battle deserve that it be told as it really happened."
l9laReRAYFk,Should I see this movie. I like the fact it’s about ww2 but on the other hand I have a bad felling this is going to be a bad movie
l9laReRAYFk,CGI. Yuck. One clip shows Japanese medium bombers attacking US carrier. I've read many books on Midway and cannot recall that occurring. Given the current leftwing politics in Hollywood I think I will give this a miss.
l9laReRAYFk,Not liking it for the simple fact of how unrealistic the dive bombing was at the end of the trailer 😂
l9laReRAYFk,The sequence of events depicted in this movie proves once again that it wasn't over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor.
l9laReRAYFk,Obsolete
l9laReRAYFk,Ships cruising 1000 fts from each other. Now that's realism :D
l9laReRAYFk,Holyshit does this look good

Fuck you nick jonas"
l9laReRAYFk,2:20 OWARI DA..!!
l9laReRAYFk,They made movies only on wars they won
l9laReRAYFk,This Movie is Sponsored by The World Of Warship Wargaming
l9laReRAYFk,"Greatest intelligence failure as if the govt didnt know about the kamikazees approaching... 

Yummmm, a nice hot plate of propaganda"
l9laReRAYFk,"Starring, athe poor man's Matt McConaughey."
l9laReRAYFk,Oh ffs here come the Americans in a battle they actually won during ww2! 😴😴😴😴😴😴
l9laReRAYFk,"0:06 what??? 


you haven't play world of warships yet???


why the hell not??!"
l9laReRAYFk,"A good movie would kinda of be, what if? Say Japan wins midway and goes on to the west coast of America. Capture Pearl harbor instead of slapping the giant and running away. Could be pretty cool. Who drew up their plan? America? Ok Tojo, here is a ton of money, bomb pearl harbor we will let you do it to get our boys angry and in to the war. Pearl harbor would have been a huge staging area for them and would have been really hard for America to take back with them bombing our shipyards and airfields on the west coast. The Pacific fleet would also not have been rebuilt. They could have put subs all around our coast lines to try and pick off ships. Another way they could have won would have been don't touch America! When Germany was 19 miles from Moscow and all the factories moved near Siberia, Japan could have used their air power to bomb them. I still think the world would be the same today, war seems like a game. We conquered Mexico city a few hundred years ago and just walked away. Conquered Germany and Japan and just walked away. Really sad for all the men that died in those wars. Why do I think it's a game? I think in WW I . well I can't even remember who was on who's side. Every war people switch sides. We saved China and Russia and the minute WW II was over they became our enemies and Japan and Germany became our allies. I really lost track of it all starting from WW I. I do know after WW I there was a huge arms race building battleships between America, Japan and England. Nobody had any clue who was going to be on who's side. Wonder if they draw straws. We were gearing up to fight Japan or England."
l9laReRAYFk,I bet this movie will do good in the Chinese market. Big think 🤔
l9laReRAYFk,Looks bad......... Smells bad
l9laReRAYFk,*BEN AFFLECKS PEARL HARBOR WAS BETTER*
l9laReRAYFk,*Pearl harbor was BETTER*
l9laReRAYFk,I can't wait for the untold true story movie for the USS LIBERTY...
l9laReRAYFk,the cgi really doesnt look that bad to me
l9laReRAYFk,"Scene at 1:45 actually happened, look up “Uss enterprise attacked by g3m Nell”"
l9laReRAYFk,I did a high school history paper on battle of midway back in high school and will go see this because I'm into WW2 and airplanes
l9laReRAYFk,Pearl Harbor the greatest intel failure. Fast forward sixty years to 9/11. Failures or suppression of the information? Not saying anything one way or another but stranger things have happened.
l9laReRAYFk,The biggest load of shit I ever watched..an insult to all the PBY crews who saved many many lives..another low budget load of shit..in ww2 catalinas had guns in both blisters..and observers constantly looking out for downed airmen..and during this film not one scene showed any attempt by the Catalina crew to look out for downed airmen..just sat talking shit..the producers of this film should be ashamed of themselves..please don’t buy this dvd and fill their pockets..shamefull bastards..
l9laReRAYFk,Hope that isn't the music in the movie
l9laReRAYFk,Better be in 4DX!!!
l9laReRAYFk,"Now we just need the Japanese to make a pearl harbor movie themselves, Showing the soldiers side of everything. In War, Not everyone wants to be there, Or do the crimes against humanity that they are told to do. And japan, Dont forget to put Hiroshima in there ;)"
l9laReRAYFk,"No Hollywood movie can get it exactly right or sometimes not even close.. This movie is a reminder of lives lost and maimed in body and spirit. You pray that we never do it over again. Thank you to all soldiers and Rest In Peace to my Great Uncle killed in Italy August 31, 1944 at the age of 20"
l9laReRAYFk,Where the black males at that help win this battle?
l9laReRAYFk,"I do hope it's not like the dreadful Pearl Harbour film. I liked Dunkirk although it lacked the big budget feel. This one has all the special effects, CGI - let's hope it is a serious good film with realism"
l9laReRAYFk,"I get many of the same vibes that many war movie fans seem to have but I have to plea to people that they should still buy tickets and see it. First and foremost because they frankly don't make many war movies anymore period, and secondly because if ticket sales for a more pop culture version of the battle can't bring in tickets then fewer studios will even think about producing more serious or dramatized ones. Go see this and just enjoy seeing some CG sinkings and dramatic music playing while that famous radio sync comes through 'Scratch one flattop!""."
l9laReRAYFk,"What, let's do this!"
l9laReRAYFk,"Given the state of Hollywood today, I wouldn't put it past them to somehow gender-swap somebody key to the battle. Maybe they could swap out Chester Nimitz into a girl, or maybe Waldron, McClusky, Jimmy Thatch or Butch O-Hare into a girl. Don't put anything past these people."
l9laReRAYFk,"I can only wonder, with considerable dread, how Roland E is going to mess this subject matter up. The Battle of Midway is one of the greatest navel battles of all time with plenty of drama all on its own--it doesn't need anything more. I see from the trailer that a fair amount of time is dedicated to the Doolittle Raid using B-25s. Umm, doesn't really have much to do with the Battle of Midway other than spurring the Japanese navy to committing to the battle. Really, I'm having Michael Bay/Pearl Harbor flashbacks."
l9laReRAYFk,"There is zero engagement because every shot is fabricated with SyFy Channel CG. Watch the 1976 version that uses real footage, real planes and ships, and physical models."
l9laReRAYFk,I’m from the Philippines and my teacher teach these True Events of Leyte gulf and Pearl Harbor. And this is the most Greatest Naval Battle in history.
l9laReRAYFk,Golf of tonkin before the golf of tonkin..You think they mentioned how the USA knew the Japanese were going to bomb pearl harbor but let it happen anyway.  P.s. Your welcome for the land LAX air port is on. It was owned by the Sasamoto family but stolen after the war..all the documents are declassified now look it up!!!.🇺🇸🇯🇵🇺🇸 r.i.p fred yuzo Sasamoto. California born and raised.💪👑
l9laReRAYFk,Had anyone watched Tora Tora Tora?
l9laReRAYFk,"another extremely stupid cartoon for exceptional morans ,,,,"
l9laReRAYFk,"That looks like a great video game. Can’t watch a CGI movie, I’m sorry."
l9laReRAYFk,"From this trailer it seems like this movie is trying to cover a lot ground.  Makes wonder how lone it is.  An hour and a half, two hours, two and half?"
l9laReRAYFk,Might as well stop with the “please don’t fuck this up” comments.  Hollywood hasn’t been able to portray warriors in a historically accurate fashion for the last 12 years or so.  The only warrior liberal Hollywood knows is the SJW.
l9laReRAYFk,Lots of whiny bitches up in the comment section 😂
l9laReRAYFk,1:13...inspector Kido?
l9laReRAYFk,Rubbish.
l9laReRAYFk,looks like a good movie but the cgi looks like garbage
l9laReRAYFk,"Some say us intelligence assumed  a pearl harbour attack but didnt prevent it, so the us has no option but enter the war if the attack happend .. which we all know now did indeed happen."
l9laReRAYFk,Looks ridiculous
l9laReRAYFk,Excelente filme baseado em fatos reais...Estou louco pra assistir..
l9laReRAYFk,a very interesting movie
l9laReRAYFk,"Oh dear... this looks like shit... *Roland Emmerich is the director*


FUCK. 


Shit movie confirmed. Prepare for cringe-history 101, gents!"
l9laReRAYFk,The first midway movie in literal years and we get *_from the director of Independence day_*
l9laReRAYFk,"99% of comments are omg i hate hollywood is Real story oh wait i need to shit some proofs So people gonna belive me oh and why do even films exist? Do some of you See how many war movies are in this World or you gonna cry and die becose this is hollywood?
 BUT THIS NOT REAL STORY  FUCKER! Every historical film heve fake story becose we cant See how it regały was. Oh you still heve some bulshit to tell? Well ok lets See."
l9laReRAYFk,These movies should be monuments. Not action thrillers. Shame.
l9laReRAYFk,Interesting are they gona mention Hiroshima?
l9laReRAYFk,just too much
l9laReRAYFk,Hope better than pearl harbor and balanced like Tora Tora Tora....
l9laReRAYFk,Microsoft flight simulator has better graphics than this.
l9laReRAYFk,"Looks amazing!  Haven't been to the movies in a long time, may have to go see this."
l9laReRAYFk,"I want to see this,just hope it isn’t anything like Pearl Harbor the movie."
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like the entire film was shot in front of a green screen. No thank you.
l9laReRAYFk,i swear if this is another fucking pearl harbour
l9laReRAYFk,Did Michael Bay approve these Special Effects?
l9laReRAYFk,The  Destiny of America is to Level up through beaten the minions
l9laReRAYFk,"Looks great, EXCEPT the CGI looks like CGI. So fake, doesn't look real at all.  Because of the fakeness, I won't be seeing it."
l9laReRAYFk,wow the CGI looks terrible
l9laReRAYFk,"""based on real events"" because it is more fiction than fact. The graphics are just stupid."
l9laReRAYFk,"This movie looks like shit.
1917 on the other hand looks fucking amazing."
l9laReRAYFk,I think I'm going to puke.
l9laReRAYFk,"1:39 Enterprise deck number is 6, not 9,  9 is CV-9 Essex"
l9laReRAYFk,"Looking forward to this one. Might even see it in a theater, instead of waiting for a rental."
l9laReRAYFk,Someone has done some thorough research about Midway. I see a LCDR  Bill Brockman as one of the characters. He was the skipper of the biggest american sub in WW2 the Nautilus (SS-168).On her first war patrol she attacked a japanese aircraft carrier. A destroyer sent to  eliminate her failed  and led airmen right to the japanese fleet. This has NEVER been revealed in ANY movie before!
l9laReRAYFk,My husband and I are students of Midway and have the utmost respect for it's importance in the final outcome of WWII.  Looking at the trailers does sadden us as the special effects of the battles are without realism.  It's like a video game...glossed over.  I'm afraid we're going to be awful disappointed.
l9laReRAYFk,"Is this about Midway battle only,or is it me because it seems to cover the whole war from Harbor to Doolittle to Midway.
Anyone i terested in this movie would know the facts,"
l9laReRAYFk,加賀も見つかったし、観たい様な観たくない様な複雑な気持ち。
l9laReRAYFk,No more Pearl Harbor style love story......
l9laReRAYFk,Awful
l9laReRAYFk,If I see Ben afleck with a fake southern accent I’m going to stab someone in the throat🤪
l9laReRAYFk,"This film was never taken seriously from the beginning.  it's a shame considering the Americans that gave theirs lives for our democracy against Nationalist right-wingers.  


The choice of director proves the non serious of this film.  Really? the director from Independence Day? Not even a American."
l9laReRAYFk,"For some reason , this gives me a war thunder feels"
l9laReRAYFk,What a load of propaganda tosh..
l9laReRAYFk,"For the people who is complaining about the cgi, the cgi really dosen't matter all it matters is about the veteran who fought for america and for the sake of democracy, the movie is just telling people how people from midway defeating the japanese from an large invasion over midway of yamamoto's plan. The cgi dosen't really matter all it matter is that the veteran that will be watching this movie will realizing how they freed people from slavery and from the form of dictatorship"
l9laReRAYFk,"Ah, a perfect squeal to Pearl Harbor 2001..."
l9laReRAYFk,Hollymollyhomeless camp! Batman. They should have made the whole movie cgi 3D animation. Crash bam boom rattatata.!
l9laReRAYFk,0:44🤔🤔🤔🤔
l9laReRAYFk,Looks almost as bad as Red Tails. Moviemakers dependent upon computers to create images. What else can they do?
l9laReRAYFk,i will see this alot of decent actors
l9laReRAYFk,"It’s probably gonna be a highly exaggerated, highly romanticized, highly Hollywood-ized version of what happened, but it has Woody Harrelson, so therefore I’m watching it.

Although, yeah, as a massive history buff, I can tell you right now that Dauntless dive bombers could not pull zero g maneuvers live that."
l9laReRAYFk,Why does this look like Batman Forever acting + Pearl Harbor the love story + DC universe CGI?
l9laReRAYFk,"1:15 - 1:22
Dutch Harbor:  Seriously?!"
l9laReRAYFk,>When your shitty american education implies this battle mattered so much that it was literally the thing that determined the war when in reality the United States was shitting out LITERALLY 90 ships per like 1 japanese ship. The Japanese military high commands long term plan was from the get go to try to fight it out in a mostly defensive conflict for WHEN we got back on our feet (not if) and just bleed America enough we'd just sue for peace but in reality the Japanese lost the war the second they declared war due to our sheer economic might.
l9laReRAYFk,Damn straight I give this a thumbs up! 👍🙌
l9laReRAYFk,Cheesy
l9laReRAYFk,"Did they just play a video of Medal of Honor: Rising Sun on a 2003 Xbox? Poor, poor CGI."
l9laReRAYFk,Old soldiers never die.

l9laReRAYFk,"Enterprise

l9laReRAYFk,I watched the fighintg scene.... Just 20 times
l9laReRAYFk,한국에서 상영까지는 아니어도 볼 수있다면 좋겠다
l9laReRAYFk,"Midway was an incredible movie,Whatever you do don't expect this one to be anywhere near as good.Its literally going to be 1/2 cartoon."
l9laReRAYFk,Looking forward to this as I noticed on Facebook the RV PETREL research ship funded by the late Paul Allen is currently at midway island & they released some sonar pictures of a Japanese carrier sunk during the battle as well as some other ships so hopefully Hollywood does this right.
l9laReRAYFk,This definitely will not be as good as the Original movie.
l9laReRAYFk,Unfortunately we will not get a Japanese perspective in this film
l9laReRAYFk,My grandpa was Midway ship. He saw some combat but he mostly cooked for the crew members. I took a tour on the Midway with him a couple years ago and he actually showed me the kitchen he cooked in. There’s a manikin in that same kitchen now.
l9laReRAYFk,So much hate in the comment section. People these days really do love to complain the smallest things. What a shit society.
l9laReRAYFk,still no Japaness view...so pity
l9laReRAYFk,really went to town on the cgi overkill
l9laReRAYFk,Just saw the premier last night. Did not disappoint.
l9laReRAYFk,Hollywood...you disgust me. WTF.
l9laReRAYFk,These movies would pique my interest if I knew the actors actually loved their country. But they probably don't.. and would rather promote commie values instead.
l9laReRAYFk,"No!  They screwed up Pearl Harbor, not this too.  Just watch the original.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CGbpbclYyQ"
l9laReRAYFk,"The CGI is laughably bad. It's so, so terrible."
l9laReRAYFk,How can the effects possibly be so bad in a movie in 2019?
l9laReRAYFk,"If there isn't a Josh Hartnett parachute sex scene, I'm walking out."
l9laReRAYFk,As soon as I saw the Dauntless scrape a wing on the water I thought to myself...this is the same Hollywood BS they tried to hand us in Pearl Harbor...airplanes flying through buildings....now through ship superstructures....I'm out.
l9laReRAYFk,I can tell this movie is bad from the start. Probably just some junk like Pearl Harbour
l9laReRAYFk,"I try the stall tactic on War Thunder, it doesn’t work...."
l9laReRAYFk,Those sushi suckin bastards had it comin......
l9laReRAYFk,"なにこれ面白そう
日本軍が民間人を攻撃してる表現があるけど
普通にアメリカの方が民間人殺してるからな"
l9laReRAYFk,That looks like some juicy propaganda
l9laReRAYFk,Awesome! I wanna watch this in the theatre
l9laReRAYFk,Quando uscirà nelle sale cinematografiche Italiane ? ! ?
l9laReRAYFk,"Hope: apparently they seem to extract scenes from battle 360
Worry: feels hollywood"
l9laReRAYFk,İts just Murican propaganda...
l9laReRAYFk,Looks awesome
l9laReRAYFk,"The Biggest mistake for japan


-Philippines"
l9laReRAYFk,"The CGI does not impress, but the bad CGI of Nick Cage's ""Men of Courage: USS INDIANAPOLIS"" cannot be outdone in the naval filmography. Or underdone?"
l9laReRAYFk,"I thought this was something some high school students slapped together with game graphics and some footage from - gag - Pearl Harbour movie - but I'm starting to realise this is really a trailer?  Oh lord .  .this looks like a huge disappointment. 

How is it possible in today's world, movies such as Dunkirk, Band of Brothers, Letters from Iwo Jima are made and then this.
As someone has stated ""From the producers of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow"" - oh lord.
I would rather watch a well done documentary on the big screen instead."
l9laReRAYFk,"When the American fleet was tattered, the submariners went to work."
l9laReRAYFk,Urrrgh...another war movie? It oughta be in BnW than colour.
l9laReRAYFk,"Well this will be complete trash as far as what really went down but fuck it. Nick Jonas, Woody and booms...Gnarly"
l9laReRAYFk,AF ແປວາ່  Midway
l9laReRAYFk,"There are scenes in this trailer that seem like Hollywood sensationalism, however, some of the scenes really did happen.  Examples:

- The scene where Bruno Guido (Nick Jonas) is in the airplane on the deck shooting at a Japanese bomber, then the bomber slices the tail of the plane off as it is shot down.  That really happened, that is NOT Hollywood!!  After that attack Bruno was immediately called up to the bridge by Admiral Halsey and promoted from Aviation Machinists Mate 3rd class to 1st class.  Unfortunately, later in the battle Guido's plane was shot down.  The pilot and Bruno were picked up by a Japanese destroyer, interrogated and then, with gun shells tied to their feet, thrown over board.
- A whole squadron of Dauntless dive bombers attacking one Japanese carrier, true again.  When the dive bombers finally discovered the Japanese fleet and dove to attack the pilots were so excited they all pretty much went for the same ship.  Some realized this and broke off to attack a different ship.  Also, bombers and torpedo planes do have guns that face forward for the pilot to use, they're just not the best dog fighters.  But they do have the ability to dog fight if necessary.

I will say that the ships protecting the carriers, both US and Japanese, are way too close to the carriers.  The ships did form defensive rings around the carriers but they were spread out far more then what we are seeing in the trailer/movie.  As for those who are saying the explosions look fake, may I ask what your (real world) references are to compare them too?  I have never seen a real 500 lb. armor piercing bomb explode on a ship.  The days of dive bombers and torpedo planes have long passed any of us seeing what kind of an explosion they make.  I'm sure there are a few who have commented who have seen how an air dropped bomb explodes but I'm willing to wager not as many as there are making the comments.  I am looking forward to the movie and hope to be entertained, I also hope that they do keep the Hollywood ""seasoning"" (as one commenter put it) to a minimum."
l9laReRAYFk,pearl harbor again ? expect an attack on american soil like 9 11 or bigger this time . m guess ? seatte
l9laReRAYFk,This looks as shit as the Pearl Harbor movie.
l9laReRAYFk,I only have to look at the cast to see it's going to be rubbish.
l9laReRAYFk,10/10 Shoulda let em have the west coast.
l9laReRAYFk,"Made by a bunch of people who have zero basic aircraft knowledge. Red tails all over again.

Dunkirk treated the aircraft with actual respect and care to how they should actually maneuver."
l9laReRAYFk,I don't want see my IJN waifus sunk
l9laReRAYFk,"The air crews should include gays, lesbians and trans-sexuals. And admiral Yamamoto should be a girl."
l9laReRAYFk,"It is great to see Hollywood making historical movies, but the over use of CGI animation makes the battle scenes look like a Star Wars battle.  The movie Midway in the 1970’s used real aircraft and reel combat footage and was well done.  I hope the makers of this movie keep the combat scenes accurate and historic rather than fantasy."
l9laReRAYFk,"If you want to see a better movie watch get the 1976 movie Midway with a long list of famous actors like Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchem and Charlton Heston....  They use film footage of the fighting not CGI."
l9laReRAYFk,When's the 16-bit version coming out?
l9laReRAYFk,"Ok, I know how this movie ends."
l9laReRAYFk,really only one ethnicity!!  pu
l9laReRAYFk,Why do Hollywood WWII films ALWAYS get dive-bombing completely wrong?
l9laReRAYFk,If I want to see that much CGI I'll play a computer game.
l9laReRAYFk,Watch the history channel instead of dog fights over this
l9laReRAYFk,"The problem is that a movie like this needs a director like Spielberg or Cameron, not Roland Emmerich."
l9laReRAYFk,Damn you bitch americans you lost the war Japanese military power destroyed you and the occupied Americans used nuclear weapons for long live Japanese empire
l9laReRAYFk,If Sabaton's song midway isn't in this movie I'm gonna be disappointed
l9laReRAYFk,"At around 1:38 to 1:50 nick Jonas plays Bruno Gaido he was on deck and ran to the back of the plane and shot the plane down.. the plane nearly misses crashing into the uss enterprise saving her from a nasty suicide hit and cartwheeled across the flight deck while clipping the back end of the plane where Bruno gaido was. Admiral bull Halsey promoted him to aviation machine gun 1st class.. sadly he was captured and tied with weights and tossed overboard into the sea. 

I watched battle 360 and alot of military shit so I know lol."

l9laReRAYFk,"Please, oh please lets hope this movie does not dumb down the subject by jamming the story through the usual Hollywood crap prism.  The true story - one which eclipses anything imaginable by the most creative screenwriter- has been written.  Intrepidity, check.  Heroics beyond measure, check.  Audacity in the face of overwhelming odds, check.  Great movies such as Star Wars take their cues from events such as the battle of Midway.  This movie wrote itself in the blood of the original cast.  Phony, annoying romantic interludes and other superfluous distractions will be a disservice to a story that needs absolutely no enhancement.  Lets hope they get this one right..."

l9laReRAYFk,looks like a generic historical action movie with bad CGI and possibly even a worse dialogue.
l9laReRAYFk,"""Midway"" was produced by a Chinese film company.  We've even outsourced our history to China.  After Spielberg's masterpiece, ""Saving Private Ryan,"" all other war movies are lame, by comparison."

l9laReRAYFk,WTF WITH CGI THESE DAYS ................................................
l9laReRAYFk,"Nice submission for ""throw as much war-movie cliches as you possibly can in a trailer""... Jesus Christ this is horrible..."
l9laReRAYFk,"I think this is a reboot of Pearl Harbour 2001 movie based on real historical events, follows American boyhood friends Rafe 
McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) as they enter 
World War II as pilots. .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGYcxjywx0o&app=desktop"
l9laReRAYFk,I swear if they overseason this with ‘Hollywood’....

l9laReRAYFk,"I hope this will be a 3 hour movie




ps. I'm from Philippines Leyte"
l9laReRAYFk,Looks cgi’ed to death like red tails. What a waste of a promising movie
l9laReRAYFk,I thought Ed Sheeran Is a leading Man. Lmaof😃
l9laReRAYFk,the Editing is like a game
l9laReRAYFk,In this movie why japanese looks so weak
l9laReRAYFk,"""Director of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow"" That should tell you everything you need to know."
l9laReRAYFk,"CGI..... should be realistic..... well, even for 70% of it.  CGI is boring. Good luck for this movie."
l9laReRAYFk,Dive bomber pulls out at deck level yet pulls away safely. That cgi stuff is almost always terrible in accuracy.
l9laReRAYFk,Glad I'm not the only one who found the CGI to be corny. The guy at the end pulling out? No that would not happen. Just no.
l9laReRAYFk,Just imagine if we hadn’t won and Seattle down to San Francisco was destroyed and taken by Japan
l9laReRAYFk,I imagine this will be told totally from the American perspective?
l9laReRAYFk,Now if want the real movie get the 1976 Henry Fonda classic with same name.
l9laReRAYFk,"I saw the first couple of minutes of Pearl Harbor I knew I was in trouble when it showed the Japanese planes flying around the decommissioned frigates in West Loch at Pearl. Then the bomb that blew up the Arizona was bouncing around when in reality it was a 2000lb 15 inch battleship projectile I knew I was in trouble. 
 Other WW2 movies that were pretty good. In no particular order. 
 1. Sailor of the King
 2. The Enemy Below
 3. 12 O'clock High
 3. The Gallant Hours
  plus all of the( ""Duke's ) movies. 
 And if anyone is so inclined and wants to,  heaven forbid, read try Walter Lords ""Day of Infamy"" ."
l9laReRAYFk,"This can never happen again, umm 😐. The Philippines was also a major intel failure 😬."
l9laReRAYFk,nice movie....
l9laReRAYFk,blatant fucking propaganda
l9laReRAYFk,"For the love of everything holy, I hope they don't make this into another ""Pearl Harbor"" or ""Red Tails.""  Just tell the story as it happened, the good, the bad, and the ugly."
l9laReRAYFk,"im gonna be honest here...
but y is the movie looks like WWII In the Philippines??



sorry for bad grammar :p"
l9laReRAYFk,Watch the 1976 movie first. Better yet read the book by Gordon Prang.
l9laReRAYFk,Don’t make it corny and NO LGBTQ in this either keep it raw
l9laReRAYFk,First Trump now this? The USA is officially a farce now.
l9laReRAYFk,"I agree, please don’t muck up this truly great battle against tyranny and evil. A lot of brave men died during this battle. Hopefully, they will be honored justly!"
l9laReRAYFk,This is one of those examples where people complain about to much cg in movies. Looks pretty fucking average
l9laReRAYFk,"Those interested in reading a Japanese pilot's account of the Battle of Midway should read 'The Miraculous Torpedo Squadron' by Juzo Mori on Amazon Kindle. Only recently translated into English, Mori's autobiography gives a vivid account of life in pre-war Japan, training to become a pilot, flying in China, training for and carrying out the attack on Pearl Harbor, his role in the attacks on Wake, Midway and Guadalcanal, and more. A must read for students of the Pacific war."
l9laReRAYFk,That CG looks like garbage. Even worse because the action it's trying to depict has the stupid dial turned up to 11. For example ships don't bunch up at sea - there is no reason to and it would be horrifically dangerous when they're all performing sudden turns and other combat manoeuvres. Compare to actual historical footage of Midway and it's an embarrassment.
l9laReRAYFk,"It's astonishing how science fiction/fantasy is little more than a reinterpretation of our own story and technology.

Truth, indeed, is stranger than fiction."
l9laReRAYFk,fuck all this it didnt happen like that cgi bullshit
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like a CGI shit fest.
l9laReRAYFk,Michael Bay's Pearl Harbour set the benchmark for this sort of film. The attack on Pearl Harbour sequence was superb and visceral. The excessive (and obvious) CGI in this trailer takes away any impact this film is trying to have.
l9laReRAYFk,It seems no aviation movie will top Dunkirk
l9laReRAYFk,1% movie 99%CGI. Trash.
l9laReRAYFk,"Is the carrier named the ""Midway""?"
l9laReRAYFk,This looks terrible. Pearl Harbour (2001) looks more  realistic.
l9laReRAYFk,"Not enough black, Trans, lesbian, bi, orherkin  in that movie"
l9laReRAYFk,Give me that AM65 zero
l9laReRAYFk,*YOU GOT A HOLE IN YOUR RIGHT WING*
l9laReRAYFk,CGI plus no Charlton Heston!👎
l9laReRAYFk,This movie is too white
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like they have OVERLOADED it with CGI fakery. At least TRY to make it look real! They show all dive bombers diving together in one tight little group? And they don't release their bomb until just a few feet above target? And they are only flying at about 32mph?
l9laReRAYFk,"looks like zero attacked civilian street in Pearl Harbor.


Japanese zeros DiDN'T attack or bomb civilians  !
Strict order was given.


Midway（1976） was fair,  but this ...


2nd Pearl Harbor（2001）?"
l9laReRAYFk,Dumb question does anybody wonder what would the world be like today if there was no World War I or World War II or Wars in general
l9laReRAYFk,"The infernos on the Japanese carriers were so horrible that their heat triggered machine guns to fire automatically. The bombs' shockwaves ripped sailors apart as if they were rag dolls. Entire damage control parties perished, roasted alive behind bulkheads they couldn't open to save the engine rooms. Colonel Henderson was strafed to death after he bailed out of his Marine F2A Buffalo fighter. Many of Yorktown's pilots insisted they nailed Kaga instead of Soryu. You can't beat books and logs for realism. Let's just see how closely this latest movie bares the gory horror that was Midway."
l9laReRAYFk,Pearl Harbor Americas worst intelligence failure in America theybsaid that will never happen again  hmm then the same intel comes out weeks before the dredded 9/11 day hmmm smfh now you cant board a plane with a bottle of water hmm little to late huh smh
l9laReRAYFk,Even the trailer has a factual inaccuracy....There were no twin engine Japanese aircraft involved at Midway...or Pearl Harbor...or the Doolittle Raid.  What has Hollywodd done with all of the real military historians and advisors?
l9laReRAYFk,washington is wrong
l9laReRAYFk,look like a cheap remake of the 1976 movie which was pretty good
l9laReRAYFk,Cuando sale en cines??
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like Pearl Harbor 2.0 so that sucks
l9laReRAYFk,When will this come out on DVD cannot Sgt at the movies want to see this.
l9laReRAYFk,I wish every Film company own the Title of War of the Worlds it doesn't really matter too Paramount they are not even here too Make a New sequel Movie War of the Worlds i wish the 2005 Tripods are back
l9laReRAYFk,The cgi looks horrific
l9laReRAYFk,PG13 hahahahahahahahahahaha
l9laReRAYFk,"Yo, Hollywood, THIS is from the guys who lost...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBBHfRCgHAU
... you could learn from this. 
Or try ""Flags of our Fathers""  or ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" as the vibe you're looking for.


The preview has that overhyped over-contrived feeling to it."
l9laReRAYFk,I've been watching a man in the high castle I know that the Japanese won.
l9laReRAYFk,"Well, I'll just wait for it to come out on DVD.  I just can't handle the viewers shoving vast amounts of popcorn in their fat mouths and chomping loudly. It upsets that balance of the screaming and machine gun kills."
l9laReRAYFk,The CG ruined the movie
l9laReRAYFk,Starting at 1:00 the music starts sounding just like the music from the Batman vs Superman trailer https://youtu.be/fis-9Zqu2Ro
l9laReRAYFk,This really relates to war thunder
l9laReRAYFk,Japan was coward for this. Just pure evil work
l9laReRAYFk,My grandfather was the last casualty to die  as a result of the kamikaze attack on the USS Lexington. My father  was only 6 months old at the time.  My grandfather never even got to lay eyes on his son. 😭
l9laReRAYFk,Looks even more retarded than pearl harbor with ben aflack
l9laReRAYFk,"I saw the 1976 Midway in the theater and I still love it. The star-studded cast was incredible. It was back when men were actual men. Most of the actors today seem totally unable to be convincing in WWII movies. It seems like the further we get from WWII, the less they are able to make decent WWII movies
The trailer looks like the typical Pearl Harbor/RedTails overly done CGI bullshit. A Dauntless dive bomber hanging in a stall would be dead meat.
The actual battle of Midway was an incredible event filled with real stories of real people in real situations that could fill a hundred great movies! I only hope this movie is better than this trailer."
l9laReRAYFk,"This looks terrible. I already see so many issues. Ooof, yeah I'll be seeing 1917 over this."
l9laReRAYFk,This could be a great movie. As long as it doesnt have a fricking love triangle in it!
l9laReRAYFk,Giant piece of cinematic shiiiiiIIIIIIIIITT
l9laReRAYFk,Did the B25 bombers  were able to start and land on landing carrier?
l9laReRAYFk,"What a sad excuse for a CGI. we are already in 2019, CGI should be realistic at this point. I hope this is not the final edit, this is the greatest naval battle in history just next to leyte gulf."
l9laReRAYFk,I see no KAMEKAZE here :/
l9laReRAYFk,This is just ambushed japan navy in midway .is not interesting anymore when enemy plan got broken and act like being losing the war in movie.
l9laReRAYFk,This is gonna be totally biased I know it
l9laReRAYFk,The CGI looks like it has cheesy video game graphics purposely intended to look like a fake overly exaggerated Sci-Fi. I like the old Hollywood Pacific battle films better that flew real stunt planes that glistened across real sunlight and through real shadows with real explosions and smoke.
l9laReRAYFk,"Why do they need to remake a classic......does hollyweird not have any original thoughts anymore? I mean, really now, CGI? To me, using CGI to remake a classic is like colorizing an old photograph. The 1976 version was overly embellished, somewhat believable, but was nevertheless enjoyable. I'm sure the 2019 version will be way over the top in special effects. Big deal. What is really a shame is that the trailer speaks of the courage of a few men....a FEW?!! So sad."
l9laReRAYFk,"Pilots from those times had titanium balls

l9laReRAYFk,"Teacher: we are going to midway for a field trip
Girls: but there’s no data or WiFi 
Boys:"
l9laReRAYFk,"Oh, great.  Just what we needed, another shitty WWII movie.  Why do these directors think that turning a historical event into a live action cartoon will do justice to what actually happened?"
l9laReRAYFk,Also this reminds me of the same plot about the same thing as Poral habor
l9laReRAYFk,Another World of Warships trailer?
l9laReRAYFk,"Computer graphics lack photo realism. ""Titanic"" from '97 had more convincing graphics."
l9laReRAYFk,Somehow this trailer looks like a elaborate War Thunder movie.
l9laReRAYFk,"""AF"""
l9laReRAYFk,Can y’all just shut up and watch the movie without complaining. Like god damn its a movie not a history book from 9th grade.
l9laReRAYFk,The midway battle did not deserve to be treated this way. Pure trash!!!
l9laReRAYFk,"WTF, why is Mandy Moore in this film?  What the hell will she be doing?  Nagging him to not fight for his country and to pay more attention to her?  I can tell already this is going to be badly done."
l9laReRAYFk,Please don't tell me there are all-wise female admirals telling those silly men how to fight a war.  I've had enough SJW crap lately.
l9laReRAYFk,Its like warthunder .
l9laReRAYFk,this one or 1917?
l9laReRAYFk,Whoaaa this is a great movie!
l9laReRAYFk,"I hate when i see people comment ""where are the women"" or like ""why isn't my race incuded"" I'm sorry but in the 1940s there was segregation. It's supposed to represent the 40s, not the 2010s where everyone must be included."
l9laReRAYFk,"i hope this isn't the final cgi renditions.

Its borderline cartoony."
l9laReRAYFk,Intelligence was not a failure it was ignored
l9laReRAYFk,cgi gone wild
l9laReRAYFk,The first naval battle in history were ships didn't get with inside of each other.
l9laReRAYFk,My grandpa fought in Coral Sea and Midway and wound up spending the rest of the war in the Indian Ocean. You got an able flying cross for his efforts in Midway and Coral Sea I wonder if he is going to be mentioned by name in this movie. He did fly a dauntless.
l9laReRAYFk,"Midway: *exists*
Japan and America: guess we’ll meet each other _midway_ there... 🤪"
l9laReRAYFk,This is what we are learning on the philippines
l9laReRAYFk,"So far so good, doesn't look like any SJW crap infested films Hollywood is churning out nowadays. I could be wrong considering it's only a 2 minute clip. If this is the case, I expect VOX to do an article of female pilots underrepresentation due to the male patriarchy."
l9laReRAYFk,"Hollywood mostly doesn't know how to make a compelling war film, this is quite a disrespectful attempt."
l9laReRAYFk,"I'd rather be strapped into a chair and forced to watch ""2012"" over and over again than see this monstrosity. I loved the original. I'll not see it destroyed by the guy who thought ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was riveting speculative fiction."
l9laReRAYFk,Real planes used= 0
l9laReRAYFk,"From the trailer alone, this movie is already historically inaccurate. Where are the Japanese planes transforming into robots?"
l9laReRAYFk,http://www.autohoax.com

l9laReRAYFk,"I love my ears, they like to hear only what they like, so the entire trailer i hear only this:

l9laReRAYFk,They had a chance to do it justice but it looks like another pearl harbor cringe.  They dare-not try to appeal to the historic realistic audience but instead will try for the bigger crowd at any cost and all for the bucks.

l9laReRAYFk,CGI fest no one asked the navy for a boat or two? Lol
l9laReRAYFk,"Was hoping this movie would take queues from chernobyl, saw the *From the director of Independence day*"
l9laReRAYFk,pearl harbor was also a huge Japanese failure. they didn't destroy the repair facilities and they didn't destroy the Enterprise. all but two American aircraft that fought at pearl were from the Enterprise. but the Japanese did not sink her. if they had and Enterprise had not.fought at midway.... that is why midway is sometimes refered to as the revenge of the E. the same carriers and pilots who shot down everything launched by enterprise at pearl were destroyed at midway
l9laReRAYFk,With all these war movies coming out Midway. The one about the Briits World War one movie 1917. I wonder if were being ramped up again for real war?🤔
l9laReRAYFk,Bad cgi
l9laReRAYFk,"Joe Blake and Robert Childan were naval officers huh? Well, this is certainly an interesting alternate reality."
l9laReRAYFk,"Say all you want about it but I'm sticking with the 1976 version, both Japanese and American sides shown, tactics, historical figures ( Rotchford, McCluskey, Yamamoto, Nimtiz) and the aircraft are used correctly."
l9laReRAYFk,"Hollywood should’ve got Christopher Nolan to direct this. This already looks pretty awful and generic! Terrible CGI, and I really hope they at least got the planes right..."
l9laReRAYFk,I swear if we get a fucking useless side love story....
l9laReRAYFk,"Just got late to the cinema and catch this trailer, i asked if we were in 2001"
l9laReRAYFk,"Its crazy, how would those dive bombers even take off with such a heavy pair of balls on board; i guess that's why diving was their specialty"
l9laReRAYFk,"Think i will watch the original movie about the battle, rather than this Pearl Harbour 2.0"
l9laReRAYFk,"This looks terribly one-sided. At least Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor bothered to portray the Japanese pilots as more than faceless, digital enemies. I enjoyed ID4, The Day After Tomorrow and 2012, but Emmerich is clearly the wrong director for this. It's a shame someone like Ridley Scott wasn't given the reigns of this FiLM."
l9laReRAYFk,too much cg... looks like new worldofwarships trailer
l9laReRAYFk,"The 1976 Movie 'Midway' was pretty good.
Don't know if this can be as good.
Also 1970 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'  movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor is well done and factual.
Hope they don't screw this new movie up.
Young people today have no clue about or history. 
Hopefully they will see it.
'Hacksaw Ridge' was a Great Movie but unfortunately sales were very low."

l9laReRAYFk,Zero's flying like tie fighters? Historically not accurate. More respect for the veterans!!
l9laReRAYFk,"That's by far some of the worst looking special effects and CGI I've seen in a modern big budget movie.  What the Hell happened to Roland Emmerich?  Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 all had amazing special effects.  Here it looks like every battle scene has poorly lit actors on a greenscreen.  Hell, to compare it to something similar, the movie Pearl Harbor from 2001 looked WAY more real than this, and that's 18 years ago!"
l9laReRAYFk,This looks pretty bad and knowing who directed it makes it that much worse.
l9laReRAYFk,"I will go watch this, but I have a gut feeling this movie will not be as good as the original with Charleton Heston and Henry Fonda (among many other A-list stars of the day).  This one is going to rely heavily on CGI whereas the original used actual footage where possible."
l9laReRAYFk,is this movie gonna be available in indonesia?
l9laReRAYFk,"...a handful of planes?...

Uhrm...you had the entire complement of Midway marine strike aircraft, multiple squadrons of 4 and 2 engine heavy bombers from Midway and Hawaii...plus three full USN fleet carriers worth of aircraft.

The Kido Butai was under continuous air attack for hours. The success of the handful of planes that made the decisive attack could be traced to the efforts of all the previous attacks degrading the air CAP over the enemy carriers.

In addition, there WERE NO PLANES ON THE ENEMY CARRIERS DECK. The IJN did NOT warm up strike aircraft on the deck like USN carriers. They were warmed up in the HANGER...which is why the bomb hits were so devastating.

It really is sad to see Hollywood continuing to use the discredited for over 50 years stories of how this battle unfolded."

Its the actors(which were great on those films and series the soldiers on WW2 always seem to look and ""feel"" different to those now),costumes, the acting, the locations. Here on the other hand🤔 idk the cgi(is this a war thunder trailer?) could use a lot improvement, the pilots look like shiit on their heavily edited planes and i hope they dont give us that pearl harbor treatment again(thanks a lot Bay🖕) all in all i will still give a chance but they old version still stands as better. 

P.S also for WW2 film lovers watch Stalingrad(truly a great film from the old times)"

Japan had destroyed the American battleships at pearl harbour and destroyed HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales on the same day, then conquered the whole of south east Asia defeating the Americans in the Philippines and the British at Singapore and now was threatening Australia. The UK were too committed fighting Nazi Germany in Africa and the Mediterranean to send enough help, the Russians were losing to major German Offensives on the Eastern front literally everything hinged on the Americans winning this battle to stop the relentless Japanese advance. The film “DUNKIRK” used a real Supermarine spitfire and the sense of realism was iconic. Surely on a Hollywood budget a Kate or a Devastator Torpedo bomber, a Val or a Dauntless dive bomber or a Zero or a Wildcat fighter can be built and flown using original paint schemes? CGI doesn’t cut it for such a pivotal battle in world history. If the US would’ve lost the Japanese would have invaded midway then Hawaii then from there it could threaten California. It seems CGI has won out again I pray this isn’t the case"

They are just going to milk the crappy movie and pocket the expected 100 million bucks

l9laReRAYFk,"What alot of people don't grasp is that that generation went in head first into the most terrifyingly destructive form of warfare this world has ever created and seen but they prevented what would have been a VERY DARK age in our history but they paid in blood to stop it.. To many do understand the absolute magnitude of these events. As a millenial, its our job to understand this."
l9laReRAYFk,"Too much CG, plz learn something from Christopher Nolan."
l9laReRAYFk,"Pearl Harbour happened in 1941, the Midway campaigns started just after. By 1941 US had a total of 25k going to a total of 300k being produced by the end of the war whilst Japan had a total of 15k by 1941 going to a total of 76k by the war end. 
Trailer @1:45 American Soldier 'This isn't a fair fight'."
l9laReRAYFk,I work at Pearl Harbor’s shipyard and it blows my mind where I stood was bombed and full of bodies
l9laReRAYFk,something's already tell me that the original midway movie (1970's ? ) is much better that this mega noisy hollywood shit
l9laReRAYFk,You put a wingtip in the water you're toast.

l9laReRAYFk,Maybe Japanese hates this movie
l9laReRAYFk,Is this a movie or video game? Insane amount of CGI....
l9laReRAYFk,"Hey, i saw a Bjorn!"
l9laReRAYFk,"As a historian, I'm extremely put off by this trailer.
There's a Youtuber who made a video about midway from the Japanese perspective. It's far better than any documentary I've seen about Midway thus far.
If the director(s) & writers would have done any research, the trailer would be leagues better. The movie could potentially rival legends like Tora Tora Tora, Waterloo, Zulu & A Bridge too Far.
A link to the video I mentioned : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd8_vO5zrjo"

l9laReRAYFk,"*face palm*  Wow.  Such incredible inaccuracies! Ok, maybe it will be rather entertaining, but as far as the real thing.... nothing close. Ugh.  I realize that they want to put out a roaring action film, but c'mon. Jap planes did NOT fly among the ships at Pearl.  And what Dauntless could ever outclimb a zero?! 
  Clearly, those who have studied the battle in the Pacific will have to remove their brains prior to the film starting.  Wow.  smh…."

l9laReRAYFk,"from the director of Independance Day and The Day After Tomorrow. 


Well this movie is fucked."
l9laReRAYFk,"Looking fine awaiting this movie with much expectation nevertheless too much CG making the movie appears to be a video game. They should have built the real aircraft carriers and Hellcats, nothing beats the REAL ONES, 1/1 full scale lol."
l9laReRAYFk,"It's fortunate that the Pacific Fleet didn't have advance warning because if the battleships had sortied, they couldn't have been re-floated and repaired. They would still be at the bottom of the Pacific."
l9laReRAYFk,I can tell this is going to suck .
l9laReRAYFk,"Please for the love of God, get rid of any Japanese aircraft that were never there. Get rid of the Bettie bombers form any of the trailers and maybe form the movie, although I know that the movie was already been edited and shipped, the Bettie bombers are land based aircraft."
l9laReRAYFk,one small point. how the hades does an o2 mask seal on pilot with a mustache?
l9laReRAYFk,American propaganda
l9laReRAYFk,"If the movie is 90+ minutes worth of the bullsqueeze in this trailer, no thanks. Why the F can't Hollywood make a semi-realistic WWII movie involving air combat? Pearl Harbor was bad, but this looks truly awful."
l9laReRAYFk,1:39 hull number painted in 1942?
l9laReRAYFk,Is going to be a shiiiiiiiii
l9laReRAYFk,"Looks like another ridiculous remake of a great film with superior actors. Reality is dramatic enough. Why they need to go over the top with exaggerated cgi more suitable for a video game is beyond me. Guess that’s all millennials know about history, is what gamers put in “Call of Duty”. Looks like another “Pearl Harbor” esque joke."
l9laReRAYFk,"Ironic that they mention Pearl Harbor is the greatest intelligence failure in American history and it was also the greatest failure in terms of historical accuracy on film. Yes I am talking about the Micheal Bay CGI mess fest. This looks like more of that and that isn't a compliment. I love WWII period films. But Tora Tora Tora is a far better film than Pearl Harbor ever was. You know what made Tora Tora Tora, or A Bridge Too Far or hell even Gettysburg; so damned good? The use of practical effects and attention to authenticity. The B-17 that lands on one wheel in Tora Tora Tora? That was real, flown by a real pilot. The Zero that crashes into a hangar? That was real too, they launched the Zero down a chute packed with explosives. The P-40 that veers wildly and explodes on the runway after being strafed by zeroes? That was real too. It was controlled electrically.

You know the line in the trailer about ""We believe the target is Midway"" and we then hear ""Washington disagrees."" This I find hard to believe.

Do you know where the Office of Naval Intelligence was in 1943? That's right...Washington DC. 

The Americans had been decoding Japanese communications since 1942. This was made evident at midway. 

""Since early 1942, the US had been decoding messages stating that there would soon be an operation at objective ""AF"". It was initially not known where ""AF"" was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse of telling the base at Midway (by secure undersea cable) to broadcast an uncoded radio message stating that Midway's water purification system had broken down.[54] Within 24 hours, the code breakers picked up a Japanese message that ""AF was short on water"".[55] No Japanese radio operators who intercepted the message seemed concerned that the Americans were broadcasting uncoded that a major naval installation close to the Japanese threat ring was having a water shortage, which could have tipped off Japanese intelligence officers that it was a deliberate attempt at deception.""

While I don't have any records I find it hard to believe that the Commander in Chief would not be kept abreast of the situation of by his advisors and staff. Especially after the mistakes that were made at Pearl."
l9laReRAYFk,Aw man. can't wait.
l9laReRAYFk,Only H'wierd could fubar WWII.
l9laReRAYFk,Disgusting CGI
l9laReRAYFk,"Sigh seems nothing has been learned since the dumpster fire that is the 1976 original ""Midway"". This remake looks to be an even worse movie...."
l9laReRAYFk,This movie could have been EPIC...But it looks like a Cartoon
l9laReRAYFk,Is a movie portraying heroic white men still allowed in Leftist Hollywood?
l9laReRAYFk,History Channel did it better when they used to do history.
l9laReRAYFk,"Nah,boring sh*t...
Make a movie about the real german heroes of ww2."
l9laReRAYFk,Terrible. Looks like a video game...
l9laReRAYFk,Why?
l9laReRAYFk,💩
l9laReRAYFk,To much Hollywood wait till 10 dollar Wal-Mart ben
l9laReRAYFk,"Way over-done and bad CGI, typical scripted lines, Transformers Level ""Added"" overdone action... sorry, pure modern hollywood crap. Give me reality, grit, good acting and a great story."
l9laReRAYFk,Garbage. I’ll take the original with the one and only Charlton Heston.
l9laReRAYFk,"For you youngins here, there's already a Midway film.  It's from 1976 and lacks the garbage cgi and distracting garbage love story."
l9laReRAYFk,Ill go back to the 50s version over this CGI nightmare. The acting also looks like ass. Probably because they tried saving so much money that absolutely nothing real went into it and they all had to act in front of a green screen.
l9laReRAYFk,"The CGI alone discredits the ""REAL STORY"". Bring on the Soap Opera that goes down like saccarhine....and let's blame America in the first place for fighting back.....

Hey, let's remind the the viewing public that one political party was NOT IN FAVOR of putting all people of Japanese descent in concentration camps for the duration of the war.  I mean if we must make a political statement, to tell the truth......."

l9laReRAYFk,"Ça a l'air totalement surréaliste. Est-ce que les réalisateurs du film se sont sentis obligés d'en faire des caisse ou quoi ?
L'histoire de base n'est-elle pas assez spectaculaire pour qu'il faille rajouter des tonnes d'effets spéciaux grotesques ?
Arrf j'aurais tellement aimé un vrai bon film sur la bataille de Midway, à voir la bande annonce je sais d'avance que ce ne sera pas le cas ici.
Nostalgique de Tora Tora Tora, ça c'était du cinéma !"
l9laReRAYFk,At least Pearl Harbor used practical effects and was shot on film. This is godawful CGI shot on digital video. Looks fucking shit.
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like a fun video game.
l9laReRAYFk,"Its not mentioned ,but is this an  X-Box exclusive ? Hopefully it'll be on PS4 , just got one ."
l9laReRAYFk,"is this wht a low budget film ? clean cgi there 🤦🏼‍♂️
bettr watch pearl harbour"
l9laReRAYFk,This shit is gonna blow. Watch the original Midway movie. Just like the Pearl Harbor movie against Tora Tora Tora!
l9laReRAYFk,"This must be a exciting film,
Based on pure tactic, Japanese side was out of luck! She lossed four carriers in a one day sea battle based on some unlucky events. I still admired their splits (certainly without any moral justification). But just compared from soldier to soldier's duty and hornor.
Before watching this film, there is no harm to watch Japanese's version of middle way from a Japanese film ""Isoroku"" shoot in 2012."
l9laReRAYFk,"I think war movies have become quite shitty in the past years... so unrealistic and even worse, they are more about the action than the horrors of war. Therefore they are using WAY to much CGI insteat of models and everything just looks fake or like a Battlefield game..."
l9laReRAYFk,Mmmmmm....hope to God this isn't another Pearl Harbor....please!
l9laReRAYFk,꼭! 봐야할 영화네요
l9laReRAYFk,Ha...looks bloody awful!
l9laReRAYFk,"I will watch this movie. Thanks to the battle of midway, south korea was able to stand on our own way from fxxx Japanese. Thanks."
l9laReRAYFk,I  am indian..  I never knew about midway.. So the Japanese and american.. Battle!!!  Huh im. On americans side.. I hate the Japanese anyways
l9laReRAYFk,"This movie is about ""The battle of Philippine Sea"" in history,I'd rather want to see Lionsgate make a movie on  ""The battle of Leyte Gulf"" the biggest sea battle in history..or ""The Death March"" where thousands of Filipino and American soldiers where marched to death by the Japanese Empire..Location: Philippines"

l9laReRAYFk,"USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA lol. America, Fuck ya!!"
l9laReRAYFk,Film is about midway but most of this trailer seems to encompass pearl harbour and Doolittle’s raid.
l9laReRAYFk,"Personally I don't mind if the CGI in Roland Emmerich's Midway Movie are not the greatest, just as long as the story is told well, true and in a way that honors our veterans. Historical films of this magnitude are so rare in today's Hollywood that I'm praying that it is one of the highest grossing films of 2019 so that studios in the future will grant bigger budgets and production values on par with the Marvel movies so we can see more movies about the real ""superheroes"" of history."
l9laReRAYFk,2:25 of this were real life and he came off a dive of a few thousand feet with even with the dive breaks this maneuver of cruising by and touching the water would tear his wing right off
l9laReRAYFk,CGI looks horrible 😐👎🏻
l9laReRAYFk,"So much potential, ruined by Hollywood CGI."
l9laReRAYFk,really fake looking CGI
l9laReRAYFk,The greatest victory in U.S. military history to date.
l9laReRAYFk,Can anyone confirm for me that the scene in the trailer where a sailor is jumping onto a fighter plane and proceed to shoot at a bomber crashing toward the deck of a carrier (assuming the carrier is the Enterprise) and the bomber end up cutting the fighter in half. If that in honor of Bruno Gaido? If so that would be pretty cool. Though I didn't think that event happened during Midway.
l9laReRAYFk,"Looks to represent the very worst in a holliday blockbuster. Plus horrible cgi, but that is because i have seen movies like Tora Tora Tora, A bridge too far & Dunkirk..."
l9laReRAYFk,"In my opinion, the Wake Island Saga deserves a movie, especially in honor of the pilots and Marines who resisted from December 8, 1941 to December 22, 1941. All the valiant Marine pilots did with only four F4F- 3 Wildcat (eight lost on the ground in the first Japanese attack) deserves a movie !!"
l9laReRAYFk,give it to me now pls
l9laReRAYFk,"Problem is the effects look bad, they director probably doesn’t no a thing about the history of the battle, and last they don’t have the military song Midway March by John Williams."
l9laReRAYFk,"WE'LL MEET AT MIDWAY! 
TO WIN THE FIGHT, TACTICS ARE CRUCIAL! 
NAVAL WAAR!"
l9laReRAYFk,"When they start a trailer with words like ""based on true events"", you know the movie will be piece of crap"

l9laReRAYFk,Is this a Chinawood (Hollywood) movie  ?!
l9laReRAYFk,"I'll give this movie some leeway as long as they get the core events of midway right, especially since all scenes with Enterprise are rmid-WW2 retrofit Enty."
l9laReRAYFk,There's just not enough CGI in this film...👎
l9laReRAYFk,I wonder if there will be any Hawaiians in this movie that takes place in Hawaii.
l9laReRAYFk,Battle of Coral Sea was another big battle before Midway
l9laReRAYFk,the 1943 the arcade game brought me here
l9laReRAYFk,Cgi fake as fuck. Looks terrible
l9laReRAYFk,"Pearl Harbour was not the biggest fail of the American history. It was the cheapest way decided by an clear but 
evil spirit to get in the Great War! Shame on America, shame for their dirty history of the indian genocide, Golf war's, Vietnam war, Korean war, arabic spring, Isis, syrian civil war ... With other words, shame for all that war's wich caused bye America and this are the most! America's politics are evil and satanic child raper und human flesh eaters! Shame on you America that you sold your soul for rubbish"
l9laReRAYFk,"From a battle that has been studied and well documented, you would think that Emmerich would get it right. Many scenes in the trailer were wrong. Photographic evidence is in archives and all over the internet. It doesn't take more than five minutes to see which formation the planes were in on an aircraft carrier, what type of ordnance the planes actually carried and how a torpedo plane lined up it's target."
l9laReRAYFk,CGI burning my eyes
l9laReRAYFk,Finally..return to Toxic Masculinity 💪🏽... which built civilization
l9laReRAYFk,"Why am I thinking this is going to be a major letdown compared to the original Midway?  Probably about like Pearl Harbor compared to Toro, Toro, Toro. Looks like lots of CGI involved. :("
l9laReRAYFk,"Can't wait to watch this 😍 
From Vietnam"
l9laReRAYFk,Графонисто !
l9laReRAYFk,"Was the CGI for this movie done by a 12 year old? Seriously, just go spit in a veterans face instead, that would be less disrespectful."
l9laReRAYFk,"I'll watch it for the entertainment value, not the ""based on the real events"" value lol Man, the cast alone is to die for"
l9laReRAYFk,"Methinks ""Enterprise"" would have been a better title."
l9laReRAYFk,"This looks horrible...

I'll stick with the 1970s film instead."
l9laReRAYFk,"Please don't let this be another ""America won the war"" idealist film like a Pearl Harbour was, pushing the stereotype that they won everything. I understand if it is a little jingoistic as it is an American won battle and they fought well but don't let it be over the top.

Please don't let this say only a few american planes fought at midway against thousands of japanese when the lack of Japanese air power was the main reason 
they lost at Midway.

Please don't let this push the American Underdog cliche when the United States Navy was generally much more powerful and large than Japan."
l9laReRAYFk,it looks like a living action video game
l9laReRAYFk,Niech Amerykanie zrobiom film o dewizionie 303
l9laReRAYFk,People can talk all the smack they want about the movie Pearl Harbor from 2001 but at least it looked realistic unlike this shit
l9laReRAYFk,"No Ben Affleck, good start.."
l9laReRAYFk,"Why do they make it seen they were beating up the Japanese soo easily. It took many squadrons on end to get the job done, with the Japanese mostly evading torpedoes easily."
l9laReRAYFk,I'll wait and watch this at home. Doesn't look too bad.
l9laReRAYFk,This looks like complete dog shit.  I feel bad for 3 of the actors as they have been in great movies in the past. Especially Dale Dye as he doubles as an advisor to military movies and shows.. I bet they didn't take his advice very seriously.. I doubt this movie can change my current opinion of it looking like complete CGI hot shitty garbage.
l9laReRAYFk,I got a god awful feeling this is just going to be some cgi laden POS.
l9laReRAYFk,What ever happen to practical effects? It made tora tora tora timeless to this day besides its amazing writing.
l9laReRAYFk,"This trailer is really bad phasing with cliche music.  Worse, the cinematography is making the VFX looks very fake and ugly.."

l9laReRAYFk,"Фашисты играют на чувствах патриотов, которые любят свой народ и свою родную землю, их отцы и деды укладывали свои жизни во имя буржуазного капитала.

Да и сейчас продаёт. Я к тому, ребята, что война ужасна, и никакие картинки в замедленной съемке, никакие памятники, монументы  не восполнят ветеранам ни здоровья, ни горести утраты друга, ни жизни; война ужасна с человеческой точки зрения, но её мотивы вовсе бесчеловечны. Ищите мотивы во всем, друзья. П.С.  И я не хочу сказать, что фильмы и памятники об ужасных временах не надо делать. Наоборот! О них нужно помнить, но как о поистине ужасных временах для всего человечества, кроме тех, кто занимается сбытом оружия, боеприпасов и топлива. Мирного неба над головой вам."
l9laReRAYFk,can someone tell a sandreck to the movie?
l9laReRAYFk,it is about time they make a movie about the battle of midway

this trailer, it is as if some guy watched a 30 minute History channel 
special on Midway and, without consulting any other sources, immediately
 made a movie.  Bomb's on TBD's, effective japanese AA in 1942, G3M's attacking and crashing into a US carrier? All in shitty CGI!  WTF?!  What a way to 'honor' those who participated..."
l9laReRAYFk,"1:40

Please tell me I'm not the only one recognising this from Battle 360?"
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like fiction to me. “America’s worst Intelligence failures”. What bunch of crock. They allowed those fuckers to sail in just so they can test their stupid A-bomb killing innocent civilians and allowing our people to get killed. The deep state is the cancer and we need a scalpel.

It’s likely based on the story of a few American pilots were tasked with finding the main Japanese task force. They couldn’t spot the Japanese task force but they suspected that it moved northward. The pilots’ planes were very low on fuel, but they flew north to look for the Japanese task force anyway, and they were right, there’s the Japanese fleet.

l9laReRAYFk,"*100 Million dollar budget movie.*

What is this? An early 2000’s movie CGI? Why does it look so damn bad? My god I know Sharknado was made intentionally BAD that’s what made it funny and made them lots of money...But this is supposed to be a “historical” movie, smh...

If THIS is the best Hollywood can do now and make more horrendous movie reboots that literally NOBODY asked for...then maybe their just as good as fucked."
l9laReRAYFk,IJN Yamato make a cameo? Oooooff
l9laReRAYFk,Please be historically accurate! Respect to the brave men who were there! 🇺🇸
l9laReRAYFk,Please be culturally accurate. My grandfather was 17 in the U.S Navy 🇺🇸
l9laReRAYFk,"""When the news first came that Japan had attacked us, my first feeling was of relief that a crisis had come in a way which would unite all our people. This continued to be my dominant feeling in spite of the news of catastrophe which quickly developed."" - Henry Stimson, Secretary of War"
l9laReRAYFk,"I can forgive the goofy CGI dogfights if they get the history right. Anybody out there wants to know the whole story, read Battle of Midway by Craig Symonds and Shattered Sword by Tully and Parshall. Then you can nitpick the history."
l9laReRAYFk,Ok I’m hooked. Now let’s hope they don’t use the TBD Devastator model and call it an A6M Zero...
l9laReRAYFk,"It will be interesting to see how Hollywierd warps history in this movie. I wonder how they’re going to make America look bad and the Japanese look good. I don’t know, but they’ll manage. I’ll bet you.
Knowing what Hollywierd always does, I won’t go to see it anyway."
l9laReRAYFk,where's the poc muslim trangendered female pilot I heard that saved all these white men?
l9laReRAYFk,"Just, please...for the love of reality, no fake love triangles or other stupid contrived Hollywood nonsense. This is literally one of the greatest naval battles in all of history, and the real story has more than enough drama and intrigue to suffice. Make Rochefort the legend he deserves to be, fighting against his own intellectually inferior rear echelon ""superiors"" to deliver one of the great military intelligence successes ever, and afterward getting sent to command a drydock because he pissed off too many powerful people. Get Waldron and the balls-of-steel, virtually suicidal unsupported attack of Torpedo 8 right. Maybe throw in some of Jimmy Thach rocking the new Wildcat tactic he himself devised and using it for the first time in battle against the vaunted Zeros when his nation needed it the most. And please, PLEASE do justice to McCluskey, Best, and that legendary Dauntless dive attack that in under five minutes changed the face of the entire Pacific war. Those men are gone now, but their actions far outlive them, their story doesn't need any unnecessary Hollywood seasoning added."
l9laReRAYFk,Sorry I just can’t take this movie seriously with Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz
l9laReRAYFk,The events are true but maybe in terms of action scenes (Dogfight scenes and the bombers) had a twist with Hollywood thrill vibe. But im guessing some fight scenes are actually true but unbelievable to accept. Not making them historically accurate but Japan attacking the US army is solid enough.
l9laReRAYFk,CGI non realistic bullshit
l9laReRAYFk,I hope the script pays some attention to the torpedo bombers and their aerial “Charge of the Light Brigade.” Though I realize it’s impossible to fit all the heroics of Midway into 2-3 hours.
l9laReRAYFk,bruh... they was just walking like nothing just happen in 2:20
l9laReRAYFk,Best tralier 🎶 Oscar
l9laReRAYFk,One thing the true facts are very important and this looks like a masterpiece it's self with very great praise acting
l9laReRAYFk,It seems that only Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood are able to make good WWII films in this day and age...
l9laReRAYFk,Why every movie should be like a Bay's film?
l9laReRAYFk,"""The Japanese will own the west coast""

This is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard their was literally no way for Japan to win the pacific war it as a forgone conclusion from the moment it started at most a decisive victory at midway makes the war a bit longer nothing else...."
l9laReRAYFk,"3 in 1, Pearl harbour, Doolittle, and Midway.......A bit OTT.
Still got to make some money somehow."
l9laReRAYFk,Ha
l9laReRAYFk,1:48 I thought the fate of the world changed after 2 freedoms- I mean Fat Man and Little Boy were dropped in 1945...
l9laReRAYFk,"Wonder if a certain song about this battle will be in it
🤔"
l9laReRAYFk,wow
l9laReRAYFk,I swear if this is like the Pearl Harbor movie I’m fucking ending it all
l9laReRAYFk,Why no one mentions about Japanese sacrifice
l9laReRAYFk,"Why cant they make a good ww2 movie any more, this looks so unrealistic, did you guys see the lac of face expression on the fight scenes , like the red tails  i rather see the old one, thank you Hollywood"
l9laReRAYFk,Battlefield 1943 remake looks fin awesome
l9laReRAYFk,wow
l9laReRAYFk,"Worst moment is at 1:31 mark during VT-6's torpedo attack.  The Japanese ships are WAY TOO close to each other.
The next is that the Japanese never had the shipping assets available to invade Hawaii let alone the West Coast which makes Ed Skrien's dialogue (starting at 1:13) about the Japanese owning the West Coast as garbage. A carrier raid may have been possible later in the summer or early fall of 1942."
l9laReRAYFk,Hey cool!  Wings of Fury remastered and full working on Intel HD Graphics
l9laReRAYFk,Are there any shots without CGI? And the Japanese had no plans to invade America. Propaganda crap movie
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like the life action trailer of ''War Thunder'' xD
l9laReRAYFk,"Cringe at the over the top music, which takes away any tension at all. 

I know that it's some sort of aerial manoeuvre, but the plane stalling and free falling backwards in a dogfight, just looks so unrealistic(I know it's CG but that's not the point I'm making). It's just put there for the ""money shot"", trying make people ""oooo"" and ""wow"", when it's just cheesy and laughable."
l9laReRAYFk,I heard they were going to make a movie called the USS LIBERTY.... Might be good?
l9laReRAYFk,"Another Roland Emmerich flick with a third-tier rooster of actors, outsourced CGI effects and paper-thin plot? Sign me in!"
l9laReRAYFk,Another stupid war movie. We don't need this negativity in our lives.
l9laReRAYFk,This movie has all the subtlety of a dump truck
l9laReRAYFk,"The world underappreciates how allies freed many nations from the Axis (Jap and Germany). These kind of movies should keep coming up. I am soooo gonna watch this movie. Besides, Patrick Wilson is in this movie! Must watch."
l9laReRAYFk,*Washington is wrong*
l9laReRAYFk,"2:24 is so bad, unrealistic and unnecessary, i am no military expert but i am pretty sure dive bomber don't dive that low to release the bomb so they actually miss quite a lot of the times...except that, seems like some pretty exciting large scale pacific warfare...people are complaining about the CGI, it could be better for sure, but at least i am not seeing missile destroyers exploding in pearl harbor or B25 taking off from aircraft carriers with steam catapult. and lets not compare with dunkirk, the only thing that movie ever needed is CGI"
l9laReRAYFk,Must watch movie in 2019!
l9laReRAYFk,Really awesome trailer
l9laReRAYFk,Мне понравился!
l9laReRAYFk,"Pearly Harbor, Doolittle raid as well as the midway campaign in one 2hr movie? Either this is going to be a 6hr movie or it's going to be pure overview action oriented with little detail and a lot of BS romance. Why does the tail gunner look like he is in a gravity vacuum?"
l9laReRAYFk,Not one black person in the movie?. Ayt im out
l9laReRAYFk,Make a movie about Hollywood 442nd Regimental Combat Team.
l9laReRAYFk,Doesnt look great to me...but you have to thank anybody making a film OTHER THAN another fucking comic book movie.
l9laReRAYFk,Battlefield 5s Pacific theater looks pretty lit
l9laReRAYFk,This is such bullshit...
l9laReRAYFk,"1942 japan launch the battle of midway with admiral nagumo which he was on the carrier akagi which is an amagi class battlecruiser which was converted to a carrier after the washington naval treaty along with kaga a tosa class dreadnaught now a carrier, nagumo and yamaguchi which yamaguchi was in the hiryu carrier a step sister ship to the soryu participated how ever there was supposed to be 2 more carrier, you see japan had 7 carrier in midway instead of 9(except the ryujo a medium carrier of the 5th division kido butai) the 2 carrier were in the same division of the 6th fleet division these carrier would become legendary and the backbone of japanese navy these were the shokaku and zuikaku, both participated in battle of coral sea 1942 with admiral takeo supporting the port morseby invasion with the shoho.

Meanwhile america saw this and the australian too which both sent ships to intervene the task force was task force 17 with uss lexington and uss yorktown against the japanese MO division fleet with shokaku and zuikaku however i will not discuss more about this battle as its too long and is derailing my midway knowledge however this battle couldve turn the tide if takeo wasnt a passive man and went full on aggressive and if they manage to torpedo yorktown 3 time it couldve grounded her from midway and made the 2 shokaku carrier able to participate midway as planned.

Anyways 1942 japan had sent one of the most powerful and only multi task carrier division which is the kido butai this consisted of 10 carrier, 1st carrier division akagi kaga, 2nd carrier division hiryu soryu, 3rd carrier division zuiho hosho, 4th carrier division taiyo ryujo and finally the 6th carrier division zuikaku and shokaku.

As japan prepared they had around 7 carrier ready for midway akagi, kaga, soryu, hiryu, zuiho, hosho and taiyo.  4 fleet carrier was sent in the main fleet, 1 light carrier sent in the reinforcement division and 2 escort sent in the transport division there plan was to take midway and lure the american carrier little did they know this plan was about to bite them back as american code breaker found out about this plan thinking it was alaska but admiral chester nimitz knew japan wouldnt be sending a fleet in alaska but more in midway so task force 17 and 16 was sent which was yorktown enterprise and hornet now what many people dont know is that akagi and kaga had the best torpedo squadron in the navy. Soryu and hiryu had the best dive bomber squadron in the navy and shokaku and zuikaku had the best fighter squadron in the navy however they wil lose because of the lack of intel and plane up in the sky.

Japan sent d3y2 val, b5n kate and a6m3 zero to silent midway now nagumo thought it would take 1 wave to finish of midway meanwhile he had his offebsivr carrier squadron in the hanger for the offense but a japanese officer alerted him that they needed a 2nd wave, he didnt knew the american were here so he decided to refit his kate with 500kg bomb to silent midway all 90 will need a refit meanwhile america was sending b26 to bomb them which was ineffective because hitting a moving carrier in long range is harder then you think.

Nagumo launched scout plane like the pete to get intel which was launched by cruisers unlike american where the americans launched scout planes by there carrier and there cruiser the japanese kept there carrier plane in hangar for an attack, this is where a problem comes up many historian believes if he had doubled the scout planes he wouldve had the intel come faster but he didnt as he thought there would be no american carrier yet however his officer came to him and told him that an enemie carrier has been spotted, he was suprised and told the crew to rearmed the kate with torpedo luckily there was only 26 kate with 500kg bomb but the attack of american devestator was about to begin with japan 58 zero on the skys holding off the devestator the japanese french 25mm guns burst in air as this was the battle that made the 25mm gun useful but only because it was facing an outdated torpedo plane.

After the onslaught of devestator being slaughtered japanese wondered where was the dive bomber and if you did not know carrier cannot launch off planes when being attacked as the wind will prevent them from flying toward the sky which is the reason why japan barely had zero refueling and the only carrier with no planes was the hiryu as yamaguchi sent his out for the american carrier, little did they know the american dive bomber was lost and needed to be refueled but they kept pushing and soon they found  the japanese flattop with plane on deck and these dauntless had 1k kg bomb that was AP (armor peircing) as they dive to the kaga akagi then soryu, flaming those ships up but the hiryu escaped without a scratch and she had her deck empty and her strike has found yorktown to avenge her sister her plane sunk the yorktown but the enterprise had a dive bomber heading toward hiryu and blasting her forward deck.

Photo of hiryu crippled was taken by the hosho pilot then they scuttle hiryu.
Ships like mikuma a mogami class heavy cruiser did not survive while mogami was badly damage she survived and haruna too after being targeted many time, asashio made it which she was a asashio class destroyer. 

Little did america knew that in 1942 japan was about to endangered the american carrier leaving enterprise only after the shokaku zuikaku junyo and zuiho was about to meet them in battle of santa cruz a month after the battle of the solomon island with saratoga sinking ryujo.

Anyways that is all i got to show and yes there will be spelling mistake and errors so be aware."

l9laReRAYFk,one of my favorite false flag ops.
l9laReRAYFk,Roland. This battle is one that I have studied time and time again. DO NOT LET ME DOWN AS MICHAEL BAY DID WITH PEARL HARBOR.
l9laReRAYFk,I don't really like war movies because they're too realistic but this one looks epic I just might get into it.
l9laReRAYFk,pearl harbour part 2
l9laReRAYFk,Wow
l9laReRAYFk,Wait Nick Jonas plays Bruno Gaido?
l9laReRAYFk,https://www.ebay.com/itm/143382091617
l9laReRAYFk,"Looks like Pearl Harbor mashed up with gameplay footage from World of Warships. Pearl Harbor, which is 18 years old, has better CGI."
l9laReRAYFk,"Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t middway one of the biggest aerial battles ever so this is a tad dramatised
edit:just looked it up the americans were technically outnumbered in the air but by about 10 planes."
l9laReRAYFk,"for some reason this reminds me to Battle 360, the one with CV-6 Enterprise, and i love it!"
l9laReRAYFk,Is this Pearl Harbour (Remastered )?☝

l9laReRAYFk,Thanks for showing the ending of the movie. 👏🍿🎞
l9laReRAYFk,"Sadly, yesterday one of the last 4 remaining survivors of the USS Arizona and attack on Pearl Harbor passed away...   and now there are 3 left..    Schools need to get back to teach history lest we repeat those mistakes of the past and the hard hard lessons we hoped we had learned from them...  If they don't, the future of this planet will again see a war even more deadly and most likely, a very real threat to human survival."
l9laReRAYFk,There are so many wrong things idk where to start with...
l9laReRAYFk,What's there to even watch or care about in this movie? Midway was such a 1 sided battle its basically gonna be 90 minutes of just watching the US Navy utterly annihilate the Japanese fleet.
l9laReRAYFk,im surprised tom cruise is not in this...
l9laReRAYFk,I er... no. Just no. This is complete garbage in the making with all the usual bells and whistles without a single shred of weight fullness that the actual events had. When this comes out its just going to be another soulless action movie that’s way too self aware to be remotely good.
l9laReRAYFk,America always trying to hide the shame of loosing perl harbor war. This film is evidence for that 😂😂😂😂
l9laReRAYFk,"Roland Emmerich, this is my favorite subject in history. Don't let me down."
l9laReRAYFk,Remember when they used to use actual footage when filming dogfights?
l9laReRAYFk,Roland Emmerich totally deserves to MUST WIN that Oscar award for Best Director!!

l9laReRAYFk,Pearl harbor(2001) again.
l9laReRAYFk,"the effects are so bad, it looks like a AAA game not a movie... :/"
l9laReRAYFk,My granduncle was zero pilot
l9laReRAYFk,"I don't know. I want to see this, but I'm getting way too many _Pearl Harbor_ vibes. Needs much more grit, realism and less ""Hollywood"" if you know what I mean. Like Band of Brothers, Letters from Iwo Jima, The Pacific, Dunkirk, Flags of Our Fathers, Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan or Fury."
l9laReRAYFk,It's a phony!!!
l9laReRAYFk,"Is it just me, or does 18years old Pearl Harbour, from Michael Bay, look so much better and realistic? :D"
l9laReRAYFk,World of Warships videoteam make more better CGI in Saint-Petersburg xD
l9laReRAYFk,imo the CGI Team of WoWS can do better visuals.
l9laReRAYFk,I thought I just watched the movie from a BAD CGI video game...hahahaha
l9laReRAYFk,Looks too cartoony.
l9laReRAYFk,Nothing in this movie looks like real events.
l9laReRAYFk,This looks cheap AF
l9laReRAYFk,"This look incredibly realistic. Just like... the Hobbit... This is how you honour you veterans? With a 'shoot-them-up' playstation game looking movie? Back to BoB/The Pacific/Tora etc.... Even frickin Top Gun 2, which never emphasize realism and never try to be the real thing, look a thousand times more credible."
l9laReRAYFk,Everything in this trailer looks like a videogame. Typical Roland Emmerich CGI-wankfest. Gonna be a turd
l9laReRAYFk,Wow Nick
l9laReRAYFk,Why does the CGI look so bad?
l9laReRAYFk,"I liked this better when it was called ""Pearl Harbor"". Ok, that's a lie, didn't like that one either. But at least it had better effects - even though it's already 18 years old."
l9laReRAYFk,the movie looks so ugly ...
l9laReRAYFk,I see expenses were spared for the CGI budget in this film.
l9laReRAYFk,"CGI is a little fake looking but, a period piece is always good to get as long as they get all the history correct."
l9laReRAYFk,Effects still look awful. Like high-quality CGI renders used for video games.
l9laReRAYFk,They have a BRIT playing an American pilot.  I guess there weren't any other Americans available.
l9laReRAYFk,WWII
l9laReRAYFk,This is what Pearl Harbor was supposed to be.
l9laReRAYFk,"2:20
OWARI DA!"
l9laReRAYFk,This already looks like it's gonna end up on a corridor crew's bad cg effects video
l9laReRAYFk,"Green screen , color grading and dodgy CGI. The hattrick!"
l9laReRAYFk,Please release this movie in Hindi language ... please.... please
l9laReRAYFk,I wonder how Japan feels about this...
l9laReRAYFk,This looks like a straight up video game.
l9laReRAYFk,Why does the colour grading look like badly colorized black and white photos?
l9laReRAYFk,Looks like a World of Warships fanmade movie.... CGI sucks af!!!
l9laReRAYFk,Hell yeah! Spartans!! PREPARE FOR GLORY!
l9laReRAYFk,Nice the movie

l9laReRAYFk,NICK JONAS
l9laReRAYFk,"Geezus, what do you people want? There are no more existing TBD Devastators flying anymore, about 2 Japanese Zeros in the US, and maybe half a dozen SBD Dauntless dive bombers.  All probably valued at $1-2 million each.  Did you not expect to see CGI used heavily in this movie?  And the story of Lt. Richard Best's heroics is authentic, unlike the stupid love stories thrown into movies like the original Midway and Pearl Harbor.  Would you rather go back to the stock footage of the original Midway movie that showed Charlton Heston crashing a jet onto the carrier flight deck??? LOL"
l9laReRAYFk,Fuck yeah🇺🇸
l9laReRAYFk,better watch: tora! tora! tora!
l9laReRAYFk,Nope
l9laReRAYFk,gonna be hard to top the 1976 version....
l9laReRAYFk,"how the hell do the effects of pearl harbor, a nearing 20 year old movie look better than this?"
l9laReRAYFk,Loved it. Opening on Veteran's Day is also a nice touch.
l9laReRAYFk,Pearl Harbor 2019
l9laReRAYFk,Pearl Harbor 2: Pearl Harder
l9laReRAYFk,"Love that that they made a movie about the one of the most pivotal battles in history, but if the trailer is any indication, the CG work is terrible and comically obvious...in this day and age that's just pathetic."
l9laReRAYFk,"A hit and miss director, but this could be a fantastic night at the movies. Going to give it a shot."

l9laReRAYFk,😍great❤👍👍👍👍
l9laReRAYFk,CGI is awful. Pearl Harbor was far better
l9laReRAYFk,"The original Midway was one of the things that lead me to serve in the United States Navy.   I wanted to follow in the steps of my father and the Greatest Generation.   This movie, appears to be a true well done tribute to that generation from what I can see in the trailer. Attention to detail was something I noticed right away..  We are losing that generation of heroes fast and this will probably be the last tribute to them ever made before they are all gone.   I don't watch movies in movie theaters because they are a rip off in cost and because I don't like not being able to defend myself.  But for this, last tribute I may very well go see this movie in theater because it is that big to all that served."
l9laReRAYFk,rope a dope
l9laReRAYFk,Cool cut jammers.... Kinda lovely
l9laReRAYFk,Banzai!
l9laReRAYFk,CGI looks really bad.

l9laReRAYFk,"You know education system has gone to shit when the trailer needs to emphasize this being based on real events, lul."
l9laReRAYFk,Oh gawd... I'd rather watch Midway (1976) or Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970)
l9laReRAYFk,"I'm getting a strong ""Michael Bay/Pearl Harbor"" vibe from this. As in: 'Not Good'."
l9laReRAYFk,PEARL HARBOR 2: MIDWAY. This looks like straight garbage.
l9laReRAYFk,"The CGI looks terrible. Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor still looks better than this. I really hope they can get this to look better on opening day. It doesn't help that it looks like a video game, when video games these days have more realistic graphics than this."
l9laReRAYFk,Looks so good!!!
l9laReRAYFk,"Yet again with boring, generic action trailer music.  Put Sabaton in the trailer already!"

l9laReRAYFk,What are you wanting for. Release yourself. People will watch you with family. It's awesome movie.
l9laReRAYFk,Just made for Americans I guess...
l9laReRAYFk,"But it did happen on 9/11.
The CIA had Intel that something big was coming but President Clinton forbade by executive order the sharing of data with the FBI.
From article by nbcnews:

Ashcroft instead broadly criticized inaction in the final months of the Clinton administration, saying a review of proposals to disrupt al-Qaida by the National Security Council in March 2000 went unheeded, perhaps because Clinton officials did not have the stomach for “the outcry and criticism which follows such tough tactics.”
“These are the same aggressive, often-criticized law enforcement tactics we have unleashed for 31 months to stop another al-Qaida attack ."

The casting is questionable. The actors are all great in their own right but some of them don't make sense as these characters. It looks like they're going to have Florence Pugh play Amy throughout the entire film but that doesn't really work for the character. She's the youngest at 12 when first introduced. Her relationship with Laurie is supposed to begin as a one sided crush on her part, with him not really noticing her at all until they run into each other in Europe and she's a grown woman. Timoth√©e Chalamet as Laurie doesn't really work either, at least not post time skip. He has a baby face, looks like he's 16 (which will work great for his role as the 15 year old Paul Atreides in Dune!). I also don't think Louis Garrel is old enough, or looks old enough, to play Friedrich Bhaer.

AST2-4db4ic,"The earth is in danger of ceasing its natural carbon recycling process thanks to just a handful of greedy humans. Are you enraged about this? Contact your local representatives and tell them to...

- Boycott food companies that accept and produce products from factory-style farms and agriculture (which is largely responsible for the clear cutting of the amazon forests and a huge percentage of greenhouse gas emissions.) 
- deny products into you community that employ slave labour, illegal logging, and environmental degradation of land and water to produce their products.
- Ban not only single use plastic bags. BAN single use plastic PACKAGING of products. Or tax them (the companies, not the people)
- stop accepting donations and lobbying for fossil fuel companies.  That's not democracy if you just keep ass kissing to billionaire company interests.
- subsidize local business and sustainable agriculture
- subsidize green energy production like Solar, wind and geothermal energy.
- promote healthier life styles. Ban car advertising in cities and promote public transit.
- put pressure on federal budgets to take away from military and nvest in green energy. (OR, if your country is too proud/dependent of its military, promote a reforestation/agriculture program within the military.)
- make investments into fossil fuel companies illegal and charge companies a fine for their continued ties with major oil and fossil fuel companies.
- promote reforestation programs.
- fine mines for every acre of forest and waterway they degrade through wreckless unsustainable strip-mining methods.
- fine fisheries that abandon their fishing nets in the ocean.

Join the movement, fight the symptom of climate pollution. 71% of the world's green house gas emissions comes from just 100 companies. We keep trying to reduce our carbon footprint individually, which is good and all, but the real problem comes from corporate interests. Remove that power from them, and real change will happen.

Yet in the comments below, you see people gushing on about Jo/Laurie like they don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it.

Seriously, though, you wouldn‚Äôt find it nice if your best friend, whom you have no feelings for, proposed to you, and after saying ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he still tries to convince you, even though nothing _can_ convince you because you simply don‚Äôt have feelings for him.

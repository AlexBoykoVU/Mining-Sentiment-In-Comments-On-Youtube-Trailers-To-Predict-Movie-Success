ySy8mcceTno,"This is a pretty decent movie nothing mind blowing like a quiet place, or hereditary, but the movie is pretty good enjoyable to watch the movie is your typical mythological film like Candyman or Bloody Mary type story. Slender Man is a little different at least when you want to summon him you don't say his name. For something that was created on the internet I thought they did a good job of coming up with a story, I do wish that they gave Slender Man more of an origin on where he came from and stuff but the mystery of him is pretty cool, you don't see that into many horror films. The only thing about this movie is it was not scary it was a popcorn flick, but I do like those movies as well. I thought the story, acting, directing and special effects were good. The only thing I have to complain about is that they introduce this one character that is sort of the love interest to the lead actress and she tells him not to watch the movie and they hint that he does but then they don't go anywhere with it. but all in all, it's a good movie the climax is pretty good though.

pros:
the character development was pretty good
slender man looked fucking awesome
it was pretty spooky
i had fun staring at the menu screen for 20 minutes waiting for my 7 year old brother to leave my room
that one girl was thick
the animation wasn't too bad
it had a bit of kinky porn in it
the previews were entertaining


cons:
pretty poor acting
most of the scenes were kinda boring
half of the scenes in the trailer weren't in the movie
it would've been nice to see some boobs in the make out scene
i had a seizure during a couple of the scenes
and the girl with the black hair had a uni-brow


overall i give it an 11/10
thank you so much for making this movie Nintendo","['opinion', 'slender', 'man', 'pro', 'character', 'development', 'pretty', 'good', 'slender', 'man', 'look', 'fucking', 'awesome', 'pretty', 'spooky', 'fun', 'stare', 'menu', 'screen', '20', 'minute', 'wait', '7', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'leave', 'room', 'girl', 'thick', 'animation', 'bad', 'bit', 'kinky', 'porn', 'preview', 'entertaining', 'con', 'pretty', 'poor', 'act', 'scene', 'kinda', 'bore', 'half', 'scene', 'trailer', 'movie', 'nice', 'boob', 'scene', 'seizure', 'couple', 'scene', 'girl', 'black', 'hair', 'uni', 'brow', 'overall', '11/10', 'thank', 'movie', 'nintendo']"

ySy8mcceTno,"I say this with absolutely no hyperbole or exaggeration: ”Slender Man” should have been made around the time of the characters popularity and not in the year 2018 where it’s purpose for Sony is just to administer another blatantly obvious cash-grab off of a household name in the horror genre. It’s mundane and uninspired in its atmosphere and setting in every aspect of the word, the acting isn’t remotely close to being good, it almost takes no SHAME in borrowing horror tropes from other movies and if anything, the film goes against some of the very aspects needed to actually make a horror film HORRIFYING. It is not scary and it’s ridiculously boring as hell. 


For like the first 20 minutes of the film, it drones on you for a little bit but it could’ve be done exponentially worse. It’s not god-awful but it’s just bad. The moment we pass the 30 minute mark though, everything just sinks completely downhill. The vast majority of characters involved are copy and paste cutouts of generic character stereotypes that are further exacerbated by bad acting. The creepy imagery is a nice stretch since it’s generally disturbing but not many of those moments are present to keep the film interesting. Most of the scenes are either so lacking in its ability to try or generally didn’t play out that to me, every single “scare” scene presented immediately started to look and feel the same. I’ve tried my hardest to find any speck of enjoyment out of this movie but apart from some creepy imagery and a few jumpscares (because of course there is), nothing REALLY stood out to me, even more so with the film having generally ridiculous moments plastered throughout its runtime.



There’s no real characters, no real character development, no real threat presented, no real atmosphere embodied here and apart from the creepy imagery it displays, this is YET ANOTHER movie you’ve already seen countless times already. 



The entire film is just a dull chore to watch.

In other words, majority of what's in this trailer ISN'T EVEN IN THE MOVIE. I bet what happened was the filmmakers wanted an R rating but Sony made them cut it down to a PG-13.

I really hope they release an unrated cut on blu-ray or something but I'd like to see what this movie could've been before Sony chickened out and became too afraid of scaring the children in their HORROR FILM.","['thing', 'trailer', 'actual', 'movie', 'girl', 'write', 'wall', 'start', '1:09', 'guy', 'fall', 'roof', '1:27', 'girl', 'stab', 'eye', '1:33', 'girl', 'walk', 'wood', 'start', '2:30', 'word', 'majority', 'trailer', ""isn't"", 'movie', 'bet', 'happen', 'filmmaker', 'want', 'r', 'rating', 'sony', 'cut', 'pg-13', 'god', 'fucking', 'dammit', 'sony', 'ruin', 'slenderman', 'hope', 'release', 'unrated', 'cut', 'blu', 'ray', 'like', 'movie', 'sony', 'chickene', 'afraid', 'scare', 'child', 'horror', 'film']"

ySy8mcceTno,"At first, when I saw this trailer, I was hesitant. ""Scary unrelated imagery is scary cliché"" and whatnot. The goal and story of this movie wasn't too clear, either. It seemed like a generic horror movie rather than a story about the Slenderman. And that upset me a little. I also grew to know the Slenderman creature from Marble Hornets, and how it affects people. (Yes, I know he's actually called The Operator in that series, but I didn't want to confuse everyone.) From this trailer, I went ""Slenderman doesn't make people kill themselves."" ""Slenderman doesn't normally choose random victims"" ""Slenderman usually playa with his victims more."" Now, watching the second trailer, I feel like I can piece some of this together, even setting aside what I know from good ol' Troy Wagner. The Slenderman inthis film didn't seem to choose his victims at random, which is good. Fir whatever reason, I feel like that first girl was a bigger part of the story. Also, no. Slenderman doesn't make people just kill themselves. Which is why I One: think they were close to the missing girl, which is proved in the second trailer, and Two: I think they did it willingly. To get away from the Slender Sickness (which we'll get too). I think it drove them insane and they couldn't handle it anymore.
Putting aside how Marble Hornets as a whole series operares, I feel like this movie could be really really good. They have their own way with dealing with stuff, like the slender sickness or whatnot. 

Also, another theory. That girl that we see in the hospital or whatever, screaming? She's already seen the Slenderman, and is going a little bit crazy. Of course, the doctors don't know that and they're just trying to calm her down. What if they effectively get her out of the sickness, almost like Tim's pills (for Marble Hornets fans)? She then either gets a new identity or just moves on, until most of the events in this film take place. She sees the Slenderman online, and then all of a sudden, she remembers. She tries to summon him, but it remembers her. And now it's pissed and wants her. It wants the one that got away. 
That would explain the whole ""Slenderman doesn't take random people"", and then of course her friends get involved and in turn bring it upon them.

I just might shell out the money to go see it on cheap night in the theatre, but only because I think that's the only way I might find any enjoyment in it.

I heard of this a while back, but thought nothing of it. today around 1 in the morning the memory hit me and I find this. I have mixed feelings, one being quite surprised. 2018 and Slenderman gets recognized once more, becoming a movie. Why now is my question. Now looking into this the creator of the Slenderman and some of it's mythos will be in it. I had no idea he was an actor as well. I was shocked. Now looking at the trailer I wonder, how will they portray the Slenderman. Will there be the Proxies? It looks interesting. Me being kinda shocked about it is because of all the crazy results coming from the Slenderman stories, mainly the stabbing. Not to mention that a film coming to media from a creepypasta. That's a sight to see. I have my doubts, but it also intrigues me so I'll just have to wait and see.

a meme is a form of comedy, slender man was not meant to be a meme. next time for all of you saying he's a meme, he's not.
also i don't like this kind of approach for a slender man movie, they should have gone for something like this.
a couple of college or high school students hear about a legend called ""the slender man"" so they go out in the woods to look for it. over the course of the movie it explains some history of the slender man and what happens to people who confront him. thru out the movie you get to see how each one of the student's gets kidnapped by the slender man.
they should have gone with a documentary approach. not this type of approach.

Slender Man is scary because of what you don't see.
He's a subtle background character that kills you unnoticed, like a stalking assassin.
You only catch glimpses of him because he disappears right when you see him, and only see him when you die.
The only good way to direct a slender man movie, is to make it a suspenseful horror (much like a mix between it follows, babadok, halloween, and psycho.)
Basically, take the ""monster follows slowly in the background"" from It follows, the erie, never see, but inescabable monster from babadok, and the pyschological thriller from psycho, and put in a dash of murder from halloween.","['probably', 'suck', 'slender', 'man', 'scary', 'subtle', 'background', 'character', 'kill', 'unnoticed', 'like', 'stalk', 'assassin', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'disappear', 'right', 'die', 'good', 'way', 'direct', 'slend', 'man', 'movie', 'suspenseful', 'horror', 'like', 'mix', 'follow', 'babadok', 'halloween', 'psycho', 'basically', 'monster', 'follow', 'slowly', 'background', 'follow', 'erie', 'inescabable', 'monster', 'babadok', 'pyschological', 'thriller', 'psycho', 'dash', 'murder', 'halloween']"

ySy8mcceTno,"I see a lot of people saying game-to-movie adaptions need to stop and Sony should stop making movies, but I honestly feel like this is a movie adaptation of a game that could really work. Why exactly do I think this? Well think about it, the Slenderman games' gameplay, story, atmosphere, and genre are much different than games like Halo, Ratchet and Clank, or World of Warcraft (all game-to-movie adaptions that many fans and nearly all people unfamiliar with the games find bad, horrible, or just ok). We'll assume that this movie will be based upon the original game, Slender: The Eight Pages. Slender is a horror game where your goal is to collect eight pages before the monster known as Slenderman catches you and does whatever he does to you after he gets you. Other games like Halo (shooter) and WoW (MMO) are more complex and sometimes have written and detailed stories. You can't just spend tons of money on making a 1.5-2 hour long movie where all the people are doing the entire time is shooting enemies until they reach the boss, and then continue shooting even more. You have to give it some sort of story or plot that can be turned into a movie, which doesn't always work out with some games. The difference is Slender has simple gameplay, and not much of a ""story"" exactly. You can turn the game's mechanics and features into something with a more established story, possibly changing small things along the way. It's possibly a bit of a jump, but it's like the Lorax in my opinion. The book only features the events of the boy talking to the Onceler and him telling the story of the Lorax, it's as simple as that. Yet the movie incorporated new events, characters, and details (primarily at the beginning and end of the movie) to further build the story, and it turned out excellent in my opinion. Under no circumstances am I saying Slender Man is going to be a good movie, but I am saying if Sony executes things properly, such as getting a team of writers experienced in the horror genre, it could turn out to be a good (and maybe even great) movie.","['lot', 'people', 'game', 'movie', 'adaption', 'need', 'stop', 'sony', 'stop', 'movie', 'honestly', 'feel', 'like', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'game', 'work', 'exactly', 'think', 'think', 'slenderman', 'games', 'gameplay', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'genre', 'different', 'game', 'like', 'halo', 'ratchet', 'clank', 'world', 'warcraft', 'game', 'movie', 'adaption', 'fan', 'nearly', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'game', 'find', 'bad', 'horrible', 'ok', 'assume', 'movie', 'base', 'original', 'game', 'slender', 'pages', 'slender', 'horror', 'game', 'goal', 'collect', 'page', 'monster', 'know', 'slenderman', 'catch', 'game', 'like', 'halo', 'shooter', 'wow', 'mmo', 'complex', 'write', 'detailed', 'story', 'spend', 'ton', 'money', '1.5', '2', 'hour', 'long', 'movie', 'people', 'entire', 'time', 'shoot', 'enemy', 'reach', 'boss', 'continue', 'shoot', 'sort', 'story', 'plot', 'turn', 'movie', 'work', 'game', 'difference', 'slender', 'simple', 'gameplay', 'story', 'exactly', 'turn', 'game', 'mechanic', 'feature', 'established', 'story', 'possibly', 'change', 'small', 'thing', 'way', 'possibly', 'bit', 'jump', 'like', 'lorax', 'opinion', 'book', 'feature', 'event', 'boy', 'talk', 'onceler', 'tell', 'story', 'lorax', 'simple', 'movie', 'incorporate', 'new', 'event', 'character', 'detail', 'primarily', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'build', 'story', 'turn', 'excellent', 'opinion', 'circumstance', 'slender', 'man', 'good', 'movie', 'sony', 'execute', 'thing', 'properly', 'team', 'writer', 'experience', 'horror', 'genre', 'turn', 'good', 'maybe', 'great', 'movie']"

First, slenderman is depicted as silent, he mysteriously causes children to disappear, not kill themselves.   I can't believe I'm saying this considering how much I hate this format, but the film would work better as a found footage type of affair, where the monster isn't shown off until a decent point in the story.  The point that made slender seem scary was that it was hard to know if it could be real or not, this misses the mark by making him almost like any other horror character.  The character didn't seem well designed either, I know CGI could do wonders with characters but Slender, to my knowledge, hasn't been depicted as using his hands to grab victims, he uses tentacles that come from his back.

First, there was very little dialogue in the trailer. That is off-putting to more than just Horror genre lovers. We need more than a few, very unsuccessful attempts at scaring us just from the trailer alone. This makes it seem as if the movie is going to literally only be the kids screaming, breathing, and running, with nary a gasp from the audience, unfortunately just like most other modern horror flicks out there.

Second, Slenderman was obviously just a tall, slim person in an outfit, with perhaps a tiny bit of CGI. With today's technology and modern techies, you would think the creators of this movie would try to go out and find a team that can make Slenderman... I don't know... A bit more *slender*? Take out the guy in the suit, go full CGI, and perhaps add a couple of tendrils to his back in a part of the movie, just like in the Slenderman games, so that Sony would have something to show in the trailer that would peak interest in most people. You'd have more nostalgic gamers, and even people besides Horror genre fans, rushing to buy tickets; not only to the first showing, but for many more after. Entire theaters could have been sold out if the creators had done a bit more research.

Third and last, most likely 95% if not 100% of the insects and other scenes of things that make us squirm in this trailer, will not actually be in the movie itself. It is only meant to make you feel more uneasy while watching the trailer - to, ironically, make you want to see more... Even the creepy-crawly parts. I don't know about you, but I want to see clips from the actual movie. They don't have to be the best of the best, such as the jumpscares, because then there would be no movie, but when I watch a trailer of a movie that peaks my interest at just the title alone... I hate being disappointed before I even watch the first 30 seconds.

All in all, I unfortunately don't think I'll be over-the-brim full of excitement when the film comes out; I believe I will be one of the people who will buy a ticket in advance, only so that I will have something to do that day. Needless to say, as both a horror film fanatic and a gamer by religion, I don't think this is the movie for me. However, I cannot say no to ""Slendy"". ;-)

I also didn't see any symbols either, even at 0:42 in the room with the drawings, no symbols or original references.

Geez, slender man was the icon of horror once, the unknown, but he's lost all effect, because we know everything about him.
If it were up to me, I'd base the film on the story of an English teacher, who begins to have show some weird symptoms, he is teaching on a day like any other, but he ends up writing ""It's coming for me"" as a example sentence, when he realises what he's done, he leaves the classroom early, and does some research, find out about a few mental patient who did the exact same thing. He arranges a meeting between him and them, under the watchful, eyes of a psychologist, the patients get freaked out when they see the protagonist. They tell him about the tall man and a few cryptic phrases. The teacher goes home, and does some research on the tall man, learns about its history, and it begins to haunt him in his sleep, and he becomes obsessed, he can't stop buying books from ancient times, the works on der Ritter, and the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.
Eventually he sees it. And the protagonist's daughter goes missing. 

His wife blames it on him, since he's been acting strangely. In his madness, the man murders his wife, and eventually gets thrown into a ward.

And which would you rather see: A horror movie about memes, a horror movie about Bendy and the Ink Machine (not ripping the game(I love it to bits)), or a Creepypasta.

I'd much rather see a horror movie about a Creepypasta. Creepypastas has a scary element to them. Especially Slender (refer back to the tragic stabbing.) I think this movie will provide a good amount of jumpscarea, as that is what the Slender games (Slender, Slender: The Eight Pages, Slender: The Nine Pages, Slender: Haunt, Slender: The Arrival, ect.) intend for there to be. People have actually done rituals like this (which thankfully did not succeed,) but it gave them a good scare. Which is what Creepypastas were made to do.

He rose again the 3rd day, and assured us of our redemption! Hallelujah!

Death can't hold Him down, and He won't let death hold us down either if you repent and turn to Him today. 

He will help you. He is not expecting you to clean yourself. He will do it. You just need to come to Him. He will take care of the rest. He will forgive you, wash you, and make you new, friends. 
He personally did it for me! Thank You, Jesus!

He will also deliver you from the oncoming judgement approaching this earth. He made a Way for us to escape, which is Himself on the cross for us. 

So if you don't know Jesus, please make Him Lord of your life today. You will be saved! No fancy prayer needed, just a speak from the heart.

I feel it'll just be like the 1st slender movie which had .5% of slender in it. Right now, it doesn't look good and I'm gonna start binging marble hornets who made the best Slenderman video/movie so far.

Rather than your stereotypical jump scare crap, I'd prefer something like that early part with just the low whistle and soft music, where you can tell something's off and you're growing more and more uneasy even as you question whether there's really even any reason to feel scared, and then, without any warning, it's already over.  No jump, no explosion and flood of sensory stimulus, just suddenly he's there and you know it's too late, then he's gone and you're either missing or dead or turning on your friends to kill them.

2. Okay, you get brownie points for not featuring any established symbolism in the trailer (namely the Operator symbol). How about we try to keep it out of the actual film?

3. Yay, it's not found footage! At least it won't be a BLATANT ripoff of Marble Hornets. And hopefully it will be more respectful of established lore than Always Watching.

4. Thank god that the trailer doesn't give us any more story than we would already be able to guess simply based off the premise of Slender Man slendering. Or whatever it is that he does. 

5. Yay, the most direct threat to the characters is themselves, and Slender Man isn't just used as a placeholder for a much more generic monster role. 

6. If none of these characters cough or have seizures in the first act, I will be disappointed.

ySy8mcceTno,"let's just hope that it lives up to the games. Unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen. Just looking at the trailer it's obvious that they didn't take much inspiration from the source material, I may be wrong but what I'm getting from the trailer is that slender man assumed to be the hallucinations of a mental patient. If they just go with a similar story to the game ""Slender the Arrival"" they'd get a more familiar story. Maybe if they went with one or two people finding themselves lost  in a certain area of forest that they were tramping in or researching because of people going missing or folklore of supernatural sightings. They can't find their way out and are forced to camp for the night. In the night the unusual becomes usual and they are forced to protect themselves. They discover some clues as to what the creature is and begin to refer to refer to it as the Slender Man. I'm going to leave the rest open to ideas.

ySy8mcceTno,"When I was in the 6TH GRADE, what made Slenderman scary was how it wasn’t extreme and in your face. It was paranoia. It was looking out the car window late at night on your way home and thinking if you looked close enough you would see him there. It was quiet. It was walking into a dimly lit large public bathroom and thinking he was in one of the stalls. It was something being there in the corner of your eye alone in your house at 12am. It was the fear of BEING afraid because the more aware of him you are and the more he was in your head, the more likely he would get you. I was terrified, and even though I was little it was pretty ridiculous even then to be so irrationally scared of a creature you read about on the internet. 1:41 was the only part in this trailer that almost caught that, but you could get the same thing in a game you play on the computer.

ySy8mcceTno,"A few things I wanted to point out

>""can you see him"" is the catch of the movie, multiple cuts of Staring at the forest, which is what makes him so freaky, he's hard to spot, but he's always there. One of the best things about marble hornets was searching for him in the background of dialogue scenes. When hornets started doing tighter more action paced baloney, that's when it wasn't scary. 

>He's out there watching, and he only gets closer every time you look away so you shouldn't be looking in the first place, BUT HES THERE HOW CAN YOU NOT LOOK

>the scariest thing about him is the feeds on your obsession of having to know. Humans are the most afraid when they think they are in the dark, unknown YOU HAVE TO LOOK

I think that a movie about slender man can have great potential as a horror film, but I feel like this is a step in the wrong direction.

Slenderman, virus, [surgical] cutting. I never felt that thise went together like this. I mean a plot similar to Slender: the arrival would work very well.

However, I'm a kind of stubborn 14 year old kid. What do I know? Maybe I don't feel good about this because the movie doesn't follow my idea of slender.

ySy8mcceTno,"I know this comment won’t change anything in the movie but this is just me wanting to critique the trailer.

Just watched the trailer and thought it looked ok, not great. I believe that is they just made Slender Man silent instead of making him growl it would make the scenes where it stalks/hunts someone a lot creepier. Also, if they showed less of him in scenes, but still showing him it would make him a lot more terrifying. For example, if he was stalking someone they could show some of his shadow on the ground or in the mist making him more ominous. They did okay with that in one of the final scenes of the trailer where the women is hiding behind a tree, but I believe that if they possibly made him a little more transparent it would be creepier.","['know', 'comment', 'change', 'movie', 'want', 'critique', 'trailer', 'watch', 'trailer', 'think', 'look', 'ok', 'great', 'believe', 'slender', 'man', 'silent', 'instead', 'growl', 'scene', 'stalk', 'hunt', 'lot', 'creepier', 'scene', 'lot', 'terrifying', 'example', 'stalk', 'shadow', 'ground', 'mist', 'ominous', 'okay', 'final', 'scene', 'trailer', 'woman', 'hide', 'tree', 'believe', 'possibly', 'little', 'transparent', 'creepy']"

He then gives the daughter some kind of bizzare sounding warning about the Slenderman but it scares the daughter and the father comes out and tells the man off
Next scene is at night at dinner. The Mom is dead from a car accident. The daughter is sad and she says something that initiated a fight between her and her dad. She goes to her room. She's crying looks at the picture of Mom on the windowsill and feels a bit better, but from the corner of her eye she spots a strange tall figure standing outside in the distance by the treeline outside the house. It shifts behind a tree and she runs downstairs to her dad and they go out to look for the man and find nothing. Next scene is the daughter at lunch school eating alone.

ySy8mcceTno,"Ok if I were to make a slender man movie I wouldn’t let all the victims to just kill themselves. I would make it almost like they kill people, not because their crazy, but because they want to save either themselves or their loved ones and the protagonist is one of those victims. He/she is trying to please slender to keep him at bay until he/she figures a way to kill it, banish, please it to make it break the bond and move on or escape it entirely. Some victims would be tormented in nightmares and would be sick and puke; maybe go crazy. This would lead them to stuff like anti-biotics to kill themselves to conceal the creature. Because if people just kill themselves, it’s a bit lazy. I want slender man to be smart, slow and patient. I even want him to be unpredictable not like every other ghost which is obvious and leads to a jumpscare. I want it to be like a spider due to its tentacles. The woods are it’s web and once you touch it it’s attached to you until you get it off. I was inspired by an app to make the mouth open, like the mouth of the zoom on the flash. The ending will be a battle that’s fast yet slow focusing on the protagonist and the bonded family in pairs on each section of the house making traps yet noises to make it seem their still in the house and lure the creature. Then one group encounters the creature which will be unknown as the cuts from group to group looking at the darkness. Building tension to who’s going. Once they know where the monster is (the monster WONT teleport in my version) they find the exit to the house getting in the car to escape while the creature thinks their hiding in the house suffering all the traps to realise their gone leading the creature to use its long legs to run and chase the tracks the family can’t outrun it that’s how it catches up so they shoot it to slow it down.

Also that they give some bits of iconic information about how he existed. (Hopefully referencing the web series Marble Hornets) 











Regardless of how sort of vague this trailer was from the start, I feel like this could potentially be one of the greatest horror films that Sony made yet!

I’ll reserve my judgement for when (or, rather, if) I see the movie, but expectations are pretty low. I don’t think we’re getting another It Follows or Get Out-level horror film.

As for whether or not it’s morally acceptable to release a movie like this after the stabbing incident, I’m quite mixed. For one, I don’t think an entire brand or character should be tainted because of a messed-up incident happening out of its control, but at the same time it’s poor timing to release a trailer like this after the recent sentencing of one of the girls involved, and the father of the victim has the right to be offended by something like this.

If it's real, I just hope you know how to stick to reality without making a film of bad special effects, bad plot, and completely fantasizing, a film of poor quality go.
I say it because the trailer half convinced me, but that's why nobody dares to make this film, it takes a very good director and budget, it will be quite complicated to take ""Slender Man"" to the big screen, because it is something ""absurd"", for example, recently ""League of Justice"" has come out and obviously bringing a lot of aliens, gods, superhumans, etc., is not an easy task, however, although it was not the best movie in history, it was not Not bad for as there were expectations from many critics.
I hope this does not leave much to be desired.

Si es real, solo espero que sepan como apegarlo a la realidad sin hacer una película de malos efectos especiales, mala trama, y completamente fantasiosa, una película de mala calidad vaya.
Lo digo porque el tráiler me medio convenció, pero por eso nadie se atreve a hacer esta pelicula, se necesita un muy buen director y presupuesto, sera bastante complicado llevar a ""Slender Man"" a la pantalla grande, pues es algo ""absurdo"", por ejemplo, recientemente ha salido ""League of Justice"" y obviamente llevar un montón de alienigenas, dioses, superhumanos, etc, no es una tarea nada facil, sin embargo, pese a que no haya sido la mejor película de la historia, no estuvo nada mal para como había expectativas de parte de muchos criticos.

ySy8mcceTno,This movies probably gonna be really bad. Im going to be honest I want this movie to be really good cause Slenderman is like my favourite Creepypasta but movies that are on video games usually don't do good. I really do want this movie to do amazing and I hope this movie will break the cycle of bad video game movies. I mean this movie might be able to break the cycle of really bad video game movies because Slenderman as a character and in video games doesn't really have much source material so the job of respecting source material should be easy if you get the basics of Slenderman right. I feel like the source material part and respecting it might be the easy part of making this movie even though thats a part where alot's of writers fail at when it comes to video game movies but Slenderman is pretty basic so this something the writers of this movie shouldn't fail at. I feel like if your going to make a video game movie you should respect the source material but also don't rely on it too much and get a little creative yourself and Slenderman is the perfect character for that. But my main concern isn't just source material but how will this do as a movie like will it be scary? will it be good? will it be a movie that isn't only made for video game fans of the franchise? Or will this movie just be a gigantic insult to everybody including fans of the series and people who just like movies in general? Will this movie prove that video game movies can be good? Will this movie be smart? Or boring? Or will this movie be alot better than everybody expects to be?,"['movie', 'probably', 'bad', 'honest', 'want', 'movie', 'good', 'cause', 'slenderman', 'like', 'favourite', 'creepypasta', 'movie', 'video', 'game', 'usually', 'good', 'want', 'movie', 'amazing', 'hope', 'movie', 'break', 'cycle', 'bad', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'mean', 'movie', 'able', 'break', 'cycle', 'bad', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'slenderman', 'character', 'video', 'game', 'source', 'material', 'job', 'respect', 'source', 'material', 'easy', 'basic', 'slenderman', 'right', 'feel', 'like', 'source', 'material', 'respect', 'easy', 'movie', 's', 'alot', 'writer', 'fail', 'come', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'slenderman', 'pretty', 'basic', 'writer', 'movie', 'fail', 'feel', 'like', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'respect', 'source', 'material', 'rely', 'little', 'creative', 'slenderman', 'perfect', 'character', 'main', 'concern', 'source', 'material', 'movie', 'like', 'scary', 'good', 'movie', 'video', 'game', 'fan', 'franchise', 'movie', 'gigantic', 'insult', 'everybody', 'include', 'fan', 'series', 'people', 'like', 'movie', 'general', 'movie', 'prove', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'smart', 'boring', 'movie', 'alot', 'everybody', 'expect']"

ySy8mcceTno,"Replay the video and read the following to the music:

One day, a girl by 16 named Emily hits the road to her home from school. Unplanned additional courses being the reason, she leaves at 7 p.m, 2 hours later than usual. Since she lives in a town only about 3 miles from the city centre, she walks to the public  bus stop. As usual, she takes the 10-minute-walk road that goes through the ******* Forest to the bus stop. The weather is gloomy, and no one else walks on the road. A little frightened, she picks up the pace so as to shorten the time she walks in the forest, in which she feels a spooky sense that she has never ever felt. En route to the bus stop, she hears a whistle from far away. Surprised on one hand, she thinks on her own how come can she hear a whistle from that far - doesn't even want to think of its source - frightened on the other hand, she feels the heat in her body, and the sweat droplets gliding from her hair bulbs down her forehead. Suddenly, she starts to run as if the satan himself were chasing her. To top it off, she hears loud growls. They sound as if the roots of trees are being removed. Fortunately, now the bus stop is in her sight. She arrives, and so does the bus. She sits a seat, and reconsiders what she just experienced back there. She still shakes with fear. On arriving her stop, she gets off the bus and heads her home. She knocks the door, only to find out that there is nobody home. In the depths of despair, she walks into the home, opening its door with keys. Just when she needs her loved ones with her, she is left alone. Then her fear comes true: she hears rattles up on the second floor. Wishing it all to be a dream, she enters the bathroom, and washes her sweaty face. As she becomes aware of an ordinary shadow behind her, she looks at the mirror with hesitation. He is there. She sees the reflection of Him. A grinning black face with large eyes dark as a starless night which tell much more than what words can say. To His waist lies His hair even darker than His eyes. An hour later, the poor young girl's parents come home. When her dad wants to take a bath, he sees blood enough to take a blood bath instead. He gives way at the knees screaming. Down from the ceiling is Emily's head hung. He - not knowing what to do - seraches for her dead body. But it was nowhere to be found. At that particular moment, he hears his wife's poignant scream. Desperate as if lost in an endless maze, he awaits his death, as terror caresses his soul gently as if nothing bad is going to happen. From that night onwards, the population of the town has decreased, either because of Him, or because of people's desire to not die. Just to make things worse, He cannot be traced, nor can He be seen by people other than His victims. The whole town is left to its destiny, maybe the whole country, or maybe even the whole world. Who knows?

Hell, the horror genre itself is just a copy and paste of the same scenarios over and over again; and I can't believe people are gullible to watch/pay for this cinematic trash. But over all, the most abhorrent notion is that Sony is making this film with barely any thought or effort of the original source material- this is probably a more lazy cash grab than the Emoji Movie and Ghostbusters(2016) combined. At this point the people behind this project are just throwing darts at a cork board filled with 'trendy' internet things that people like that are basically fad now.

ySy8mcceTno,"The movie looks good and I know it will be entertaining, but I do not think it was the right time to get it out. Personally they had to do it in 2012 or 2013 since in those years slenderman gained a huge popularity and was and still is the most famous of the creepypastas. Now to release it 6 years after it became famous not only with its creepypasta, but also by its games (slenderman 8 pages, slender arrival, etc) was not a good one since as now in horror movies the great majority also lost their thanks, although movies like the witch of blair, the witch, anabelle 2, the spell 2 and it 2017 did well, even so many horror movies are bad as the new movie chucky and among others. Maybe they should have done it like they did it, that is, take out the movie of the character in his year that was very famous, in the case of it was in 1990 and from there they released the film and then in 2017 it came back with a remake, if They would have done so the Slenderman movie would have been amazing and scary and more if they had done a remake for 2018 or 2019 and people would be even happier with their return to the big screen.
Remember that it is my opinion and I do not say that I do not want to see the film clearly that I'm not excited to see it, what I'm saying is that I would have liked it while Slenderman was still famous.

PD: SONY DO NOT CAGUES LIKE EMOJIN !!!!!!!

ySy8mcceTno,When the meme god to far,"['meme', 'god', 'far']"
ySy8mcceTno,"TLDR at bottom:

For those of you asking, 'What does this have to do with Slenderman?' It's a valid question, but one with equally valid answers. For starters, Slenderman never had a 'story' when it was created--it was just the result of a photoshop contest on the forums of Something Awful. Stories and video games came later, and it was all open for interpretation, because there was no set canon about it. This movie has probably taken advantage of the open-for-interpretation opportunity as well--after all, this movie seems to be based on the creature, not the games. That being said, if they have their own original storyline, it IS (however loosely) outlined in this trailer, and it may be vague for a reason. It could be hinting at the style of movie, or maybe they just don't want to make the mistake of giving away the whole plot in the trailer, like we've seen other studios do. Another possible answer to the question is: They followed the mythos. Yes, despite how outdated Slenderman is to mainstream media, it does have it's own (continuing, might I add) mythos, and a large one at that. Within the mythos, Slenderman was always portrayed as a Lovecraftian sort of horror, and, in fact, is frequently described as 'being in your head', like the trailer says.
Slenderman has had a bad history with movies (we don't talk about Always Watching), but as a fan of the history and mythos, this movie actually doesn't look half bad. In fact, I almost feel confident enough to say I have high hopes.

TLDR: As somebody who knows the mythos, this looks like a good movie, and I think people are just hating on it because they see it as an outdated meme (which is valid tbh).","['tldr', 'ask', 'slenderman', 'valid', 'question', 'equally', 'valid', 'answer', 'starter', 'slenderman', 'story', 'create', '--', 'result', 'photoshop', 'contest', 'forum', 'awful', 'story', 'video', 'game', 'come', 'later', 'open', 'interpretation', 'set', 'canon', 'movie', 'probably', 'advantage', 'open', 'interpretation', 'opportunity', '--', 'movie', 'base', 'creature', 'game', 'original', 'storyline', 'loosely', 'outline', 'trailer', 'vague', 'reason', 'hint', 'style', 'movie', 'maybe', 'want', 'mistake', 'away', 'plot', 'trailer', 'like', 'studio', 'possible', 'answer', 'question', 'follow', 'mythos', 'yes', 'despite', 'outdated', 'slenderman', 'mainstream', 'medium', 'continue', 'add', 'mythos', 'large', 'mythos', 'slenderman', 'portray', 'lovecraftian', 'sort', 'horror', 'fact', 'frequently', 'describe', 'head', 'like', 'trailer', 'slenderman', 'bad', 'history', 'movie', 'talk', 'watch', 'fan', 'history', 'mythos', 'movie', 'actually', 'look', 'half', 'bad', 'fact', 'feel', 'confident', 'high', 'hope', 'tldr', 'somebody', 'know', 'mythos', 'look', 'like', 'good', 'movie', 'think', 'people', 'hate', 'outdated', 'meme', 'valid', 'tbh']"

¿Tan siquiera leyeron su creepypasta? Porque la verdad no veo a ningun adolescente a punto de suicidarse o una terrible catástrofe provocada por un científico loco y mucho menos una personificación clara, de hecho este Slenderman me recuerda a los ""huecos "" de ""El hogar de Miss Peregrine para niños peculiares"" ahora que fueron representados en su película.

Like maybe someone finds a bunch of tapes in the forest that reveal footage of many, many people who have been reported missing over the years. You could have even implemented the pages. Maybe he is somehow connected to the pages and if you burn them all then he goes away for a lonh time. THAT would be a compelling plot! Find and burn all of the pages before the slenderman makes you his next victim, AND you aren't allowed to look at him which would drive the audiences imaginations wild because the scariest things are the things you can't see!

Encima porque no tiene nada que ver con slenderman de seguro solo vieron que era algo famoso, un par de imágenes y listo sin pensarlo mucho ya esta la nueva película de slenderman que de slenderman solo es tiene el nombre y el bosque 

Esto tiene pinta de mierda de película.

Pero si hay una mínima posibilidad de que salga bien, me comeré mis palabras y admitire mi error pero yo pienso que sera una basura porque 

En que momento en la historia de slenderman tienes que escribir ""HIM"" en un espejo.

SLENDERMAN HABLANDO TAMBIÉN DEL JUEGO NO SOLO DE LA CREEPYPASTA ES DE RECOLECTAR NOTAS EN UN BOSQUE, RAPTA PERSONAS EN SU MAYORÍA NIÑOS, ARRUINA APARATOS ELECTRÓNICOS AL ACERCARSE PERO NO POSEE CUERPOS NO INVOCA GUSANOS 

O NO SE SI ESTARÉ YO DESINFORMADO PERO LA PELICULA HUELE A MALA DESDE YA

Y hablando mas del juego y como pudieron haber hecho la película, tan simple era que poner a 5 chavales que van a investigar porque hay muchas desapariciones en un bosque, se escucha y se ve a slenderman de fondo, al rato desaparece uno, los demás van encontrando notas de personas que trataron de escapar de slenderman y después ya al final de la película son los demás chavales huyendo de él, tropezando etc y SLENDERMAN con sus tentáculos los rapta a todos o uno se salva, y ya tienes tu película de 1:00:00 y fiel al juego",

The tapes display the date of the recording, the persons name, and the time of their disappearance after the interview.

As more and more people tell her about the slender man phenomenon, she begins to notice...things. Her mentality is slowly, subtly uprooted. But she continues.

She discovers the nature of this phenomenon,  coming face to unface with it, and after following enough clues, arrives at a near lethal conclusion. But she survives.

Pan out, she is the one being interviewed by a new investigator. She has been telling this new investigator, telling you, what led to her incarceration at the mental facility she is now housed in.

As she finishes The interview, including a plea to take her story seriously, the familiar text that is included in every other interview is displayed. The date of the recording, the name of the former investigator, and the time of her disappearance.

I remember how paranoid I was to walk in the woods, especially alone, and how me and my friends used to watch Marble Hornets and EverymanHybrid thinking it was all real. That's how you know an interent urban legend or creepypasta works is if it convinces its reader that it's real, than it does a good job. I haven't seen something like that make that much of an impact since the Blair Witch Project.But like the BWP, when everyone got to know that it was all fake, it kind of lost its magic, so to speak. It doesn't help that this icon, like many other Creepypasta's, has been RAPED by the fan girl community that it feels like Creepypasta/Internet Urban Legends are just a dead genre. (Although to be interestingly, the scariest and most horrible incident involving the Slenderman and its myth was a real life incident involving his psychotic fan girls).

I'm a huge fan of Marble Hornets (the OP's of Slenderman), and it seems like the creators of this movie paid attention to what made the content so scary. They are going less with spooky, bad makeup and CGI SCARY TALL MAN GUY THAT WILL CHASE YOU and going with the more laid back, unknown kinda concept where you don't see him a lot in the main points of the movie (which is super important to the Slenderverse). I tend to like these styles better because it makes your imagination try to fill in the blanks which in all makes things more creepy and dark. I'm excited by this!

Slender Man wasn't a slasher killer like Jeff the Killer, that's what made him scary. It's subtley shown the mental torture he puts his victims through, and I hope that's explored more in the movie.

Leaning more on the bad from what this trailer did. It just seems like a surreal film more than anything, but a surreal film with an outline of a story. Surrealism only works well if it's vague only to explain something at the end, but a lot of people know what Slender Man does already. I like the idea and all, but not only is this a little late, but the trailer just doesn't get me all that excited. Now changing up the Slender Man thing in the movie could work well, but also fall apart. The only way I see this as effective or worthwhile is through change, but that change could also potentially make it worse. Then there's the characters, are they going to be hollow and pathetic bait for Slender Man, or are we actually going to be able to invest into their characters? Hollow shells, I can respect if it's going in a surreal direction. In some ways I could say the same about well developed characters, but that would take a lot of creativity to work well in a surreal film.

You should feel Slender Man's presence as if he's looming over every shot, but aside from the end of the trailer, there isn't much of that. And 3, from the brief glimpse that we saw of Slender Man, it's nice that they kept the suit, but his face is all black and burned looking, rather than the haunting white that made him stand out from over monsters.

ySy8mcceTno,"This all seems... a bit silly, to be honest.

I mean, your usual teen characters, various scenes of body horror, gore, loud screamings and something that sounds like the Slenderman... roaring? Come on, this character desserves way better than all this generic horror movie clichés. 

All the scare associated to the Slenderman (and to the games where he appeared) is about the unknown. You don't know what this creature is. You don't know what it can do. You don't know how to escape it, destroy it, or even if you can do either of that. Heck, you're not even sure what it does to its victims (even if Marblehornets has invented some answers about that). In a way, the Slenderman is almost Lovecraftian.

From my point of view, that's what should be at the core of a movie. An uncatchable, mysterious being come from nowhere, plunging a small town in paranoia only by the rumour of its appearances. A silent, unstoppable hunter that would tirelessly go after the protagonists, forcing them to use all their wits and resist the growing hold of madness and terror to escape it. Just a shadow, briefly seen in the mist of a foggy forest.


Now, I'm not saying the movie will be bad. Being attached to the original creepypasta, I actually hope this adaptation will do justice to it. But this trailer really leaves me with the feeling they got it all wrong. To do a good Slenderman movie, you don't need that much. You don't need insects coming out of the mouth of a girl. You don't need teenagers committing suicid in spectacular and gory way. You don't need a series of loud jumpscares.
You just need a progressive descent into terror, using a dark forest, a dying flashlight, and a note saying ""DON'T LOOK BEHIND YOU"".","['...', 'bit', 'silly', 'honest', 'mean', 'usual', 'teen', 'character', 'scene', 'body', 'horror', 'gore', 'loud', 'screaming', 'sound', 'like', 'slenderman', '...', 'roaring', 'come', 'character', 'desserve', 'way', 'better', 'generic', 'horror', 'movie', 'clichés', 'scare', 'associate', 'slenderman', 'game', 'appear', 'unknown', 'know', 'creature', 'know', 'know', 'escape', 'destroy', 'heck', 'sure', 'victim', 'marblehornets', 'invent', 'answer', 'way', 'slenderman', 'lovecraftian', 'point', 'view', 'core', 'movie', 'uncatchable', 'mysterious', 'come', 'plunge', 'small', 'town', 'paranoia', 'rumour', 'appearance', 'silent', 'unstoppable', 'hunter', 'tirelessly', 'protagonist', 'force', 'use', 'wit', 'resist', 'grow', 'hold', 'madness', 'terror', 'escape', 'shadow', 'briefly', 'mist', 'foggy', 'forest', 'movie', 'bad', 'attach', 'original', 'creepypasta', 'actually', 'hope', 'adaptation', 'justice', 'trailer', 'leave', 'feeling', 'wrong', 'good', 'slenderman', 'movie', 'need', 'need', 'insect', 'come', 'mouth', 'girl', 'need', 'teenager', 'commit', 'suicid', 'spectacular', 'gory', 'way', 'need', 'series', 'loud', 'jumpscare', 'need', 'progressive', 'descent', 'terror', 'use', 'dark', 'forest', 'die', 'flashlight', 'note', ""don't"", 'look']"

me hubiera gustado que hubiera salio por 2013 o 2014
cuando los crepypasta estaban en su mejor epoca(2011 AL 2014) ya que actualmente ya no son NADA 

bueno slenderman tiene varias crepypasta sobre su origen creado por fanaticos

pero creo que hay 3 o 2 que son mas conocidos por los fan de los crepypasta, creo que era uno de un demonio y la otra de un experimento fallido de un chico(84-B), no me acuerdo la otra.

SOLO ESPERO QUE LA ESENCIA DEL PERSONAJE DEL CREPYPASTA Y UNA PARTE DEL VIDEOJUEGO ESTE AHO

eso si tengo miedo que la pelicula se pase una película llena de gore sin una historia
EN ESPECIALMENTE, si la pelicula se va a basa en el caso de las niñas en la vida real,en las que arruinaron a los crepypasta y le dieron mala vista a esa historias, ya la pelicula va ser un fracaso SI O SI.

pero tengo esperanza que sea buena y que el cine traiga mas crepypasta (los verdaderos y no las versiones de los niños ratas -_- ) por que slender no es el único CREPYPASTA QUE ESTA AHI",

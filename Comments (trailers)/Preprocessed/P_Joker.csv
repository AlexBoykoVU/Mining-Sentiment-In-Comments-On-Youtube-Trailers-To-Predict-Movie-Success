Fighting to make sure, this will never happen again to him? No. I am very interested to talk to god about this, when I am gone. I think sin is not, what we think it is.

BUT, seeing this story of a man snapping, going fully mad, just because the world is mad and the only sane answer is being insane - this will be brilliant and I know I will watch it over and over again. Because this is what every one of us wants to do at certain points in life - just break from the stupid social conventions and let everyfuckingone feel our lunatic pain.

-_DJEzZk2pc,As a die hard batman fan i am going to skip this movie its nothing like the original joker. The gotham tv show thoroughly botched the batman storyline but that can be chalked to the multiverse scapegoat that dc is known for. This on the other hand is nothing more than trying to reinvent an already perfect character. Joker is an unknown person and all that is ever really known is that he had a pregnant wife he had no job and he was desperate for money when he got dressed as red hood and later turned into joker by accident. He wasn't a clown before hand and this makeup which looks nothing like joker is just a piggyback design cause it chapter 2 is coming out so thwy just trying to push the scary clown image. Joker is by all accounts perfect as a character as a villain and has the best origin one could ask for for a villain. I will not waste any time watching this in theaters or on home video. People need to leave well enough alone before it ends up being another fiasco like the MCU let happen by letting Disney get their hands on it. There should be people well versed in the comics that they make movie adaptations of especially long standing famous characters. It is a big fuck you to the fans when we have to listen to people spout off nonsense they think is canon because they saw it in a movie. So lets put it out the infinity war is way off base spiderman far from home is bull**** mysterio has always been a spiderman villain never an ally. There was no guardians of the galaxy during the infinity war. Hela is loki's daughter and loki is thor's brother. So if you want the infity gauntlet story read thanos quest 1&2 to see how he got the stones its a better story and then read infinity gauntlet to see how it should've went. As far as joker read the killing joke to learn what has been revealed about joker and his past.

August 11th, 2019 (Acts 7:6-7, H.R. 1242)
God is coming for His Kingdom and may he have mercy on the unknowing but deceived ones. They are making noise and it will only get worse. Prepare, find peace in your hearts and act when needed, till then, remain at peace.

We are all Israel. (God‚Äôs people) The only truth that matters is in God, the Commandments, and the Laws in which he told us to live by. Do not be concerned of worldly things. God told us these things. It is a simple truth. The worldly truths may only spread fear, and God does not want us to fear worldly things, it is like a virus for those being told these worldly truths that don‚Äôt believe in God. We are the ‚ÄúAgent Smith‚Äôs‚Äù of this world. They are then consumed by maybe fear, or ignorance and steered away even further from the real truth that isn‚Äôt worldly by introducing them to this hell of truths in this world. It may only damn their souls. God hurts in these moments. Love and peace to you all. Remember, the only truth that should matter is in God. Spread Love, not hell. Their downfall will come. They are only making noise but it will only get worse. Prepare. God bless you all and remain at peace. Do not be an asset in dividing humanity. They are making America the world‚Äôs enemy. Look into ‚ÄúThe Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion‚Äù, all the truth is in it, all their intentions. Seek the knowledge then turn away from feeding them your energy once you have the truth that you need. This is the foolish work of Knight Templars > Freemasons > Zionists.

If you try watching it by keeping in mind the Heath Ledger's version or the one in the DC Comics, then you will miss out the nuances of this gem.This whole teaser trailer gives the vibe of the movie Taxi Driver. The small congested apartment, the narrow hallways and the environment around him.Thorough out this teaser trailer, you could see that Arthur laughs to get through his circumstances. He is using laughter as a coping mechanism. The scene where he is in the almost empty train and laughing lifelessly, appears to be a continuation of some misfortune and it seems as if he is trying to get through it by just laughing. Also, the most powerful moment for me in the whole trailer, is the scene where he forces himself to smile even though his eyes are brimming with tears. That scene is so plapable, one could feel his sadness when that single tear drop falls from his right eye. It just breaks my heart everytime I watch this trailer.And who could miss the song that has been so aptly used in this trailer. The one used here is by Nat King Cole (originally sung by Jimmy Durante and written by Charlie Chaplin) perfectly captures the above emotion. If you could read the lyrics, you could see how poignant it is. It gives a life to this trailer and makes one see how Arthur is trying to embody this in his life across all the misfortunes that are happening to him.You could also see how the people around him treat him. When he is smiling and holding the placard in front of some shop and simply doing his job, it is the children who assault him. The Children!!! And in the train, you could see that it is the people in the suit who mistreat him for no apparent reason. One can see that it is the filth (people) around him, who destroy him completely.All in all I can say that it is a heart breaking trailer, which shows us that there are people around us who go through a lot and how the acts of cruelty done intentionally or unintentionally could derail them completely.And remember ‚ÄúAll it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive","['trailer', 'sure', 'watch', 'fresh', 'set', 'eye', 'try', 'watch', 'mind', 'heath', 'ledger', 'version', 'dc', 'comics', 'miss', 'nuance', 'gem', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'vibe', 'movie', 'taxi', 'driver', 'small', 'congested', 'apartment', 'narrow', 'hallway', 'environment', 'thorough', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'arthur', 'laugh', 'circumstance', 'use', 'laughter', 'cope', 'mechanism', 'scene', 'train', 'laugh', 'lifelessly', 'appear', 'continuation', 'misfortune', 'try', 'laugh', 'powerful', 'moment', 'trailer', 'scene', 'force', 'smile', 'eye', 'brim', 'tear', 'scene', 'plapable', 'feel', 'sadness', 'single', 'tear', 'drop', 'fall', 'right', 'eye', 'break', 'heart', 'everytime', 'watch', 'trailer', 'miss', 'song', 'aptly', 'use', 'trailer', 'use', 'nat', 'king', 'cole', 'originally', 'sing', 'jimmy', 'durante', 'write', 'charlie', 'chaplin', 'perfectly', 'capture', 'emotion', 'read', 'lyric', 'poignant', 'life', 'trailer', 'arthur', 'try', 'embody', 'life', 'misfortune', 'happen', 'people', 'treat', 'smile', 'hold', 'placard', 'shop', 'simply', 'job', 'child', 'assault', 'children', 'train', 'people', 'suit', 'mistreat', 'apparent', 'reason', 'filth', 'people', 'destroy', 'completely', 'heart', 'break', 'trailer', 'people', 'lot', 'act', 'cruelty', 'intentionally', 'unintentionally', 'derail', 'completely', 'remember', 'bad', 'day', 'reduce', 'sane', 'man', 'alive']"

No need for a motivation that makes us feel sympathetic towards him, no need for a reasonable explanation about why he became that.

I know this may sound surprising these days, given that most recent villains are sympathetic (Killmonger and Thanos, to name two) and flat, unsympathetic villains have been a failure (Steppenwolf, Ares, Doomsday), but sometimes they work!

Withdrawal from society, from empathy and the recognition of intrinsic human value... and acceptance of cold, sadistic animosity as the only practical defense mechanism.

It's all a joke.
I'm speaking of existence.
Life is death. 
Conciousness is the definition of insanity.
We're all insane in our own little way.
As a society? Just watch the news, stop and observe the world around you in a perspective outside of your comfort zone. If you have the mental capacity to do so of course.
Put yourself in the shoes and look though the eyes of those who you look down upon and judge. Realize the fact that the one you judge could pull out a gun and pop you in the head with lead without warning. Even put poison in your drink while youre not lookin. Or, just even someone's who's heart isn't as corrupted by ignorance or as selfish as yours, who actually cares for others, truly selfless...
Magnify your perspective, open your mind, and you'll see that normality is actually insanity with a rhythm that switches and is interrupted through constant chaos. 
Life, what we call existence is true anarchy. Laughter is the anarchy of the mind, that's why it makes us and our life around us, just feel better.""

Neither was necessarily wrong, just different perspectives on what they perceived to be the problem of society to be and how correct it.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Repent! The kingdom of heaven is at hand! In the beginning the LORD God, our heavenly Father, breathed into us life and blessed us with His laws, that we may be His precious and holy people! But we have disobeyed the LORD and brought sin into the world! Because we have sinned, mankind has been cursed with death! Our holy Father hates sin and He will punish all who have sinned against Him! Since the beginning we have been rebellious to the LORD and followed our own evil lusts. Humanity became more and more evil, refusing to obey the LORD and walk in His righteousness! All of humanity have sinned against Him and deserve to die! No one is good or righteous! No one can justify themselves! Every person on earth deserved to die and to suffer eternal damnation! 

But the LORD God had mercy on us all! Though we are sinners and stubborn at heart, the our heavenly Father provided forgiveness and salvation! God loved us so much that He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins! Jesus Christ was the only man without sin; for this reason He was worthy to take away our sins with His own blood! The Lord Jesus Christ suffered shame, was beaten, spat upon, brutally tortured, bleeding all over, and died on the cross! But He was resurrected three days later! He is alive right now, and God has given Him power and dominion over all things! Jesus Christ gave up His own life to save us from the wrath of God, and the blood He shed for us cleanses away all sin from us! Because of Him we can be forgiven of our sinful ways and be reconciled back to God! Jesus Christ holds the gift of eternal life, and He shall grant it to all who believe in Him and repent of their sins! 

Repent, believe and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and bare good fruit of the Holy Spirit! Repent of fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, transgenderism, masturbation, pornography, murder, wrath, strife, stealing, drunkenness, lying, witchcraft, yoga, sorcery, drug abuse, sedition, extortion, envy, arrogance, heresies, revellings, revilings, weed smoking, cussing, lasciviousness, hatred, emulations, variance, and unbelief! God revealed His mercy to us through His only Son, and we can break free from these abominations through the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ! 

But those who reject the mercy of God and remain in their sins shall be denied everlasting life! The sinner shall die in his sins and be thrown into hell! They shall weep bitterly and gnash with their teeth in unbearable pain! The Lord Jesus Christ will pull them out of hell to face His judgement, and he shall be condemned! The sinner shall be cast into the lake of fire and suffer the second death! 

Only those who are born again can escape eternal damnation! Those who have believed in Jesus Christ, repented of their sins and have been baptized in His name shall be saved! On the day of judgement Jesus Christ will grant them eternal life in the kingdom of God, and there they shall rest in eternal paradise! But you must be born again to receive this gift! No religion will save you! Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, any religion will lead you to hellfire! Only the true word of God can save you from condemnation, and the second death! Jesus Christ is the only way to be saved; repent, believe and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and be saved! Jesus Christ is returning soon to judge this evil world and only those who are born again and endure to the end shall be saved!","['repent', 'kingdom', 'heaven', 'hand', 'beginning', 'lord', 'god', 'heavenly', 'father', 'breathe', 'life', 'bless', 'law', 'precious', 'holy', 'people', 'disobey', 'lord', 'bring', 'sin', 'world', 'sin', 'mankind', 'curse', 'death', 'holy', 'father', 'hate', 'sin', 'punish', 'sin', 'beginning', 'rebellious', 'lord', 'follow', 'evil', 'lust', 'humanity', 'evil', 'refuse', 'obey', 'lord', 'walk', 'righteousness', 'humanity', 'sin', 'deserve', 'die', 'good', 'righteous', 'justify', 'person', 'earth', 'deserve', 'die', 'suffer', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'lord', 'god', 'mercy', 'sinner', 'stubborn', 'heart', 'heavenly', 'father', 'provide', 'forgiveness', 'salvation', 'god', 'love', 'send', 'begotten', 'son', 'jesus', 'christ', 'die', 'sin', 'jesus', 'christ', 'man', 'sin', 'reason', 'worthy', 'away', 'sin', 'blood', 'lord', 'jesus', 'christ', 'suffer', 'shame', 'beat', 'spat', 'brutally', 'torture', 'bleed', 'die', 'cross', 'resurrect', 'day', 'later', 'alive', 'right', 'god', 'power', 'dominion', 'thing', 'jesus', 'christ', 'life', 'save', 'wrath', 'god', 'blood', 'shed', 'cleanse', 'away', 'sin', 'forgive', 'sinful', 'way', 'reconcile', 'god', 'jesus', 'christ', 'hold', 'gift', 'eternal', 'life', 'shall', 'grant', 'believe', 'repent', 'sin', 'repent', 'believe', 'baptize', 'jesus', 'christ', 'remission', 'sin', 'bare', 'good', 'fruit', 'holy', 'spirit', 'repent', 'fornication', 'idolatry', 'adultery', 'homosexuality', 'transgenderism', 'masturbation', 'pornography', 'murder', 'wrath', 'strife', 'steal', 'drunkenness', 'lying', 'witchcraft', 'yoga', 'sorcery', 'drug', 'abuse', 'sedition', 'extortion', 'envy', 'arrogance', 'heresy', 'revelling', 'reviling', 'weed', 'smoking', 'cuss', 'lasciviousness', 'hatred', 'emulation', 'variance', 'unbelief', 'god', 'reveal', 'mercy', 'son', 'break', 'free', 'abomination', 'blood', 'spirit', 'jesus', 'christ', 'reject', 'mercy', 'god', 'remain', 'sin', 'shall', 'deny', 'everlasting', 'life', 'sinner', 'shall', 'die', 'sin', 'throw', 'hell', 'shall', 'weep', 'bitterly', 'gnash', 'tooth', 'unbearable', 'pain', 'lord', 'jesus', 'christ', 'pull', 'hell', 'face', 'judgement', 'shall', 'condemn', 'sinner', 'shall', 'cast', 'lake', 'fire', 'suffer', 'second', 'death', 'bear', 'escape', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'believe', 'jesus', 'christ', 'repent', 'sin', 'baptize', 'shall', 'save', 'day', 'judgement', 'jesus', 'christ', 'grant', 'eternal', 'life', 'kingdom', 'god', 'shall', 'rest', 'eternal', 'paradise', 'bear', 'receive', 'gift', 'religion', 'save', 'catholicism', 'islam', 'hinduism', 'buddhism', 'religion', 'lead', 'hellfire', 'true', 'word', 'god', 'save', 'condemnation', 'second', 'death', 'jesus', 'christ', 'way', 'save', 'repent', 'believe', 'baptize', 'jesus', 'christ', 'save', 'jesus', 'christ', 'return', 'soon', 'judge', 'evil', 'world', 'bear', 'endure', 'end', 'shall', 'save']"

It was actually the dad that mainly supported him. Further ruined when they make out he beat up a hardened black gang with guns - he would be dead in a second even if he did manage to beat them. She said shit about the NRA getting back at them - no, you wouldn‚Äôt even get to say that, you‚Äôd just be my bitch‚Äôs breakkie that she‚Äôd gobble up in a heartbeat üíó (I love when my bitch does that) also the NRA r more interested in making us politics more flawed by the minute than helping some idiot Germanic woman (see she isn‚Äôt white as the paint colour is different and she ain‚Äôt cuacasion as she ain‚Äôt Russian - now that Putin is in charge of the caucasus - she‚Äôs a descendant of those from German tribes)

For purist like me: why does he have a name? The Joker has been around for 90 years and we never learned his name. This is about as exciting as finding out how Han Solo got his name. I know some will point at the Killing Joke and some other ""origins"" (all of which are terrible and ruin the character). Sorry, but Alan Moore is Alan Moore. His work is amazing, but it's always non-canon because...Alan Moore. The man earned the right to take on these ideas, not these vampires that are still trying to squeeze blood out of the corpse of Heath Ledge over a decade later.


Why is Bruce Wayne a kid? The Joker is almost always roughly the same age as Batman, not what appears to be 30 years his senior. This tends to be the case because Batman created the Joker, except now he didn't? And apparently when The Batman arrives 15 years later the Joker will be an old man? What? Did ANYONE consider that their best villian will be in his 60s when doing battle with Batman now?


Why is Joker created by society? Every Batman fan alive knows that without Batman, the Joker doesn't exist. He exist because Batman exists. This was done masterfully in The Dark Knight Returns when after Batman retired the Joker didn't say a word for decades and then, while watching the news and seeing Batman has returned, a big smirk cracks across his face. But sure, society created The Joker...mind blown.

Tho I will say that the OG comics going back to the 30's never gave him a true back story. So it's tough and debatable. I like the chemical idea more than the whole society thing.

Seriously - if you're going to choose a prestigious and accomplished actor who has a reputation for being FUCKING INSANE, you could not do much better than Joaquin Phoenix.  Does anyone else remember that he applied such a tremendous degree of commitment and reality to the film ""I'm Still Here"", which was a slightly overbaked (in the stoner sense) post-modern comment on the corrosive effect of media and pop culture, that people were legitimately concerned about his mental health and well-being.  I think that speaks volumes, to a degree.

I really can't think of many actors who would be better than Phoenix - he's definitely the best choice of anyone who is 40 or older.  Looking at younger actors, the only one who TRULY pops out as being able to do that role is Adam Driver - he's the kind of guy who could really rip his teeth into a role like that.

1. The Joker has had many origin stories told, a large number by the character himself.
2. The Killing Joke was NOT the first one, is NOT a comic book, IS a one off graphic novel, and originally NOT intended to be cannon. Most DC fans can't ignore it's suspicious release year of 1988 being do close to the release of Batman, starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker with a very similar origin. 
3. The Joker's first origin story came in 1951 in Batman Vol. 1. 11 years after his debut in Batman #1, published in 1940. (He was the man behind the Red Hood).
4. What makes Joker so iconic is his insane unrelatable personality. He's the villain we don't quite understand, and can't really sympathize with. We also don't know where the fuck he came from (he already existed under the Red Hood). The character himself can't even get his own origin story straight.

Basically, this might be a good movie, but you twits saying it's more like the comics than any other joker are full of shit. This Joker, judging from the trailer, is the least like the comics....

In my opinion, this is not theatrical cinematography to enjoy with your girlfriend. This might be only my opinion, but I look at Jared Leto's 'Joker' in the 'Suicide Squad' movie and I see something more interesting - his portrayal reminded me of a joker that has already made it to the top of the criminal underworld and that's why he had a wardrobe that look bright and expensive and enticing. He wore it, not because he wanted to show off, but simply because money was overflowing from his restructuring of the criminal world. It's a shame that all the scenes Jared Leto was proud of making were cut from the film because it would've subtracted the attention of the audience away from the main characters and Will Smith. Jared Leto's joker had elements of the 'Italian Mafia Enforcer' type style and 'the Yakuza loose-canon Captain' style. You can see that comparison from the 2 or 3 scenes of the joker that were still left in the movie. I just wish youtube didn't immediately attack Jared Leto for something we hadn't seen on screen. It was all cut. Anyway, my point is, I rather see flashy stuff that you cannot see in real life rather than Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of a single white male alone with responsibility on his shoulders and zero support, which is everywhere in real life. There is no movie needed to see it.

It was an interesting take and I don't have anything against, but it was following the trend most movies do when they try to ground the costumes of superheros and villains in a more ""realistic"" way.  Of course, ""realistic"" usually just means darker, drabber and less ostentatious.  Here, once he's all dressed up, he just *stands out* against the backdrop of everything else, and seems completely alien to the environment in a really unnerving way.  Solid, bright colors, clean lines.  When I first saw that old test video they released I thought it looked awful and silly, but now I think it's amazing.

In the trailer, you see multiple people wearing clown masks in the riot & the subway scene! This implies that the JOKER will
create chaotic events that unknowingly ""inspire"" people in GOTHAM & a future person with similar mental issues/experiences that will take up the JOKER mantle. ESPECIALLY IF IN THE FUTURE A BATMAN FIGURE ARISE! Almost symbolically challenging someone to step up &
be the JOKER. 


Its similar to the GOTHAM tv show, where when the Jerome becomes the Joker, he inspires crazies even after his incarnation/death. 
I feel that even though this is a stand alone film, it will give us some sort of idea that any DCEU Joker we see involved with, for example, The Justice League, it will be implied that the JOKER they face will have been inspired by Joaquin's joker.

I LOVE the fact The Joker interacts with a little Bruce Wayne forcing him to ‚Äúsmile‚Äù and ‚Äúput on a happy face‚Äù,  just like what happened to the Joker when his Mother told him too. And he grew up to become psychologically and sociologically disturbed & challenged by everything around him. Just like Bruce Wayne will. 
This movie showcases the parallel nature of both The Joker and Bruce Wayne/Batman who are seen destined to become poor psychologically disturbed souls. Bruce already being affected by his interaction with The Joker. 
I love the fact that this film is a psychological character study of The Joker and how this also going to affect Bruce Wayne eventually becoming The Batman.

So I think that he is definitely looking down from the heavens and smiling down at Joaquin Phoenix with pride in his eyes. For the simple reason that from the trailer alone, it is clear to see that Joaquin's dedication to the Joker is second to Heath only.

I can‚Äôt help but think that people who like this have never actually bought a Batman comic.","['clearly', 'self', 'indulgent', 'attempt', 'high', 'concept', 'remotely', 'faithful', 'source', 'material', 'turn', 'beloved', 'icon', 'narcissistic', 'director', 'attempt', 'gain', 'attention', 'brave', 'interpretation', 'comic', 'movie', 'understand', 'comic_strip', 'left', 'think', 'comic', 'character', 'actually', 'resemble', 'comic', 'version', 'look', 'utterly', 'awful', 'help', 'think', 'people', 'like', 'actually', 'buy', 'batman', 'comic']"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Another alternative reality origin story.  Wished they stuck a bit to the original story which is gritty and sad in itself.... but they did include his attempt to be a stand-up, so that's a plus.  Dressing him up as a clown as part of odd jobs is where it veers off the comics.  But if the basic premise is that a man is driven mad by society, desperation, the death of his wife and a fateful encounter with you-know-who...then I'm totally interested.","['alternative', 'reality', 'origin', 'story', 'wish', 'stick', 'bit', 'original', 'story', 'gritty', 'sad', '....', 'include', 'attempt', 'stand', 'plus', 'dress', 'clown', 'odd', 'job', 'veer', 'comic_strip', 'basic', 'premise', 'man', 'drive', 'mad', 'society', 'desperation', 'death', 'wife', 'fateful', 'encounter', 'know', '...', 'totally', 'interested']"

- Unstable man wants revenge on woman.
- Man fakes death and gives her an inheritance.
- The inheritance is conditioned on her being declared mentally stable.
- Man turns invisible and uses his power to make her think she's insane.
- Everyone believes she's crazy because she's an idiot that doesn't carry around a spray paint can to use on the guy when she suspects he's there.
- Invisible man makes a mistake and gives himself away or she finally gets clever and proves he's real.
- Now everyone's on the run from an invisible man, something that's really not that much of a threat in today's world once you know he's real (again, spray paint cans or just a flour bag should do the trick).
- I'm gonna go out on a limb and declare that the good guys win. Bonus points if there's a stinger that suggests the invisible guy is still around after everyone thought he died.

An abusive boyfriend dies and leaves the girlfriend relieved. However, he comes back and is invisible. She tries to tell everyone and people start thinking she‚Äôs going insane. She then finds out his secret, kills him for good, and gets her revenge. There you go. Don‚Äôt need to watch the movie now. Also the acting. I hated 1:26. That seems like the acting skills a high school freshman has when they didn‚Äôt do their homework. And then there‚Äôs 1:23. This is practically all Blumhouse movies in a nutshell. The actors being unnecessarily creepy when nothing scary is going on. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre implying that what they‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt creepy. Which at first IS creepy. But the more they imply that they‚Äôre not being creepy leads you to believe that what they‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt creepy. Also, this just seems like another ‚Äúall men bad‚Äù kind of story. You can tell because it went from ‚Äúwacky doctor turns invisible‚Äù to ‚Äúabusive boyfriend dies and then haunts his girlfriend‚Äù. All I‚Äôm saying is that I don‚Äôt think this movie is going to be good. Like all other Blumhouse movies before it, it‚Äôs trying too hard to be scary. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm especially worried about what they‚Äôre going to do with FNaF and Fantasy Island.","['sorry', 'movie', 'look', 'bad', 'hear', 'want', 'like', 'movie', 'feel', 'like', 'remake', 'original', 'original', 'doctor', 'find', 'potion', 'turn', 'invisible', 'cool', 'wacky', 'far', 'cry', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'start', 'horror', 'cliche', 'revive', 'turn', 'invisible', 'like', 'plot', 'dumbass', 'horror', 'text', 'message', 'story', 'trailer', 'need', 'practically', 'watch', 'movie', '‚Äô', 'plot', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'die', 'leave', 'girlfriend', 'relieve', 'come', 'invisible', 'try', 'tell', 'people', 'start', 'think', '‚Äô', 'insane', 'find', 'secret', 'kill', 'good', 'revenge', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'acting', 'hate', '1:26', 'like', 'acting', 'skill', 'high', 'school', 'freshman', 'homework', '‚Äô', '1:23', 'practically', 'blumhouse', 'movie', 'nutshell', 'actor', 'unnecessarily', 'creepy', 'scary', '‚Äô', 'like', 'imply', 'creepy', 'creepy', 'imply', 'creepy', 'lead', 'believe', 'creepy', 'like', 'man', 'bad', 'kind', 'story', 'tell', 'wacky', 'doctor', 'turn', 'invisible', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'die', 'haunt', 'girlfriend', 'think', 'movie', 'good', 'like', 'blumhouse', 'movie', '‚Äô', 'try', 'hard', 'scary', '‚Äô', 'especially', 'worried', 'fnaf', 'fantasy', 'island']"

This movie looks like it will truly honor their heritage, and not rely on American celebrities giving stupid fake accents or no accents at all, and pathetic pop songs that really have no place in the world their going for. 
I have faith in Lee Unkrich, and it's really not fair to say this film is a blatant rip off when it could be improving on the ideas ""Book of Life"" had. At least see the movie first before critisizing. This could be like how ""Inside Out"" was ""Herman's Head"" and ""Osmosis Jones"" done right.

There has been a history of pixar movies and other movies being undoubtedly similar (ants vs a bugs life anyone) In fact, a pixar film called ""Newts"" was cancelled and im pretty sure it had something to do with the fact it was so similar to Rio. I dont personally believe this has ever pixar's fault, and lets face it, of any similar movies pixar's has always been on top. You could see other companies take on the film, like it, see pixars and forget the other one even existed bc their movies are true art at their finest (lets not bring up cars 2). People claim that pixar copies other movies because they come out after the other movie. However, pixar spends an unimaginable amount of time on their films. It might take them months and months to create one scene and then redo it because they thought of something better. If you are a pixar theorist like me, you also know they think things through. Like its crazy the way pixar works if the pixar theory by jon negroni is true. Easter eggs are well arranged as is how the story contributes to the pixar timeline. Now, i liked the book of life, dont get me wrong. Maybe we should enjoy having two wonderful films, even if theyre similar.

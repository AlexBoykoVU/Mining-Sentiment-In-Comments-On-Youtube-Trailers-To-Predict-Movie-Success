He also executive produced the following 7 H'ween¬†sequels, after which his son Malek took over (he'd¬†already been invoved in H7 and H8), and continued¬†work with the franchise, incl. the one above. 

And the relatively unknown 13-year-old¬†Adam Hollander (I've found no relation to Tom...), who debuted onscreen in 'Halloween' (1978) as ""Keith"", was killed by a car while driving his bike, few weeks¬†shy of¬†his 20th b-day in¬†1984.

The 30-year-old genious who brought his original 1978 script to Akkad Sr. was the same guy who co-produced it, as well as the above 2018¬†movie version,¬†directed the original, as well as composed, played¬†and recorded its soundtrack,¬†incl.¬†one of the most¬†recognized, beloved and scary¬†horror movie¬†themes (https://youtu.be/lNMIlubmwOQ) ever,¬†Mr. John Carpenter, is now 70, and tours with his movie music around the globe, and has become a rock star of sorts...I'm really looking forward to this movie, although I'm almost as old as Michael Myers... 

""Loomis:¬†I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil."" 

Also: ""Was it the Boogey Man?"" [Laurie in the end] ""Yes."" [Loomis] 

Due to its shoestring budget (~$300,000*), the prop department had to use the cheapest $2 mask that they could find in the costume store: a Star Trek (1966) William Shatner mask. They later spray-painted the face white, teased out the hair, and reshaped the eye holes. Shatner admitted that for years he had no idea his likeness was used for this film. It was only during an interview that someone mentioned his mask was being used. He has since stated that he is honored by this gesture. 

*) The movie made some $70 mill. wordwide, 40 years ago. A Marvel movie today costs ~$150-200 (!)¬†mill, and rakes it in the first weekend. 'Halloween' (2018) cost ~10 mill. bucks, which is the equivalent of Tom Cruise's shoe budget in any given movie, just to make him 6-8 cm (2-3 inches) taller, just like Sly Stallone and Arnold Shwarzenegger...

How can you avoid this and not develop Michael Myers character? I like the idea that he has lost his prime. Only has sight in one eye. They live and escape from new York both have endings that can delvop Michael Myers intelligently. He can be molded by prison system or escape from new york. Why wouldn't he be waterboarded? Also he can have satire like they live.  People stalking him on social media would be satirical. So in 1978 stalking is hiding behind doors. Now it has taken a digital dimension that is not of his time. But then it's about Jamie Lee Curtis too. She has made a remake and brought her maturity to it. But now we see facing death and vengeance as honest parts of her character. In a way John carpenter's comic book elements of Michael Myers ended up with Rob zombie slapstick horror.

She will most likely ruin Halloween, she will play another bitch who thinks that her mother is insane.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"it fucking irritates me the sequels are being ignored but anyway this does look good.  Considering it's a sequel to the original their attention to detail looks great with the dodgy eye and the hole in the mask.  But it may appear that way on the surface as when you dig deeper into this trailer Michael seems too exposed and not like in the original when he was there and not there, also in this trailer he kind of bumps into the kids but in the original he grabs the little kid and also in the original Michael escapes on his own when he is ready not by luck that's implied in this trailer.  They want to bring back the shape.  Good.  But please remember that Michael is the shape because of the fact he is so inhuman but we know he is human,  He doesn't speak, he is inhumanly patient, has insane strength for a normal size guy, can literally disappear in front of your eyes, eats dogs for nourishment and can take getting stabbed in the neck, eye and gut and get shot 6 times and not only does it not kill him but barely even slows him down.  

This is why he is the shape not just that he kills randomly, as lets face it that's something pretty much every serial killer has in their locker.  I hope they remembered this.  And for me Michael wanting to kill his bloodline was terrifying and unique.  Most family members of serial killers if not all are immune from their actions.  But in Michael Myers case they are the main target.  If you think Michael would not come after you cos you don't have Myers blood you are wrong.  In every Halloween film he stalks and kills randomer's before he goes after Laurie or Jamie.  (my particular favourite is H2 after leaving the elrods he notices and then stalks and kills alice) Carpenter wrote this and in the same film made them siblings.  So you see making them siblings actually made him scarier.  Haddonfield represents every town perfectly so regardless if he sees you then you have had it bloodline or not.  (young 17 females in particular lol)  Michael Myers has always been the shape until Zombie showed up.","['fuck', 'irritate', 'sequel', 'ignore', 'look', 'good', 'consider', 'sequel', 'original', 'attention', 'detail', 'look', 'great', 'dodgy', 'eye', 'hole', 'mask', 'appear', 'way', 'surface', 'dig', 'deeper', 'trailer', 'michael', 'expose', 'like', 'original', 'trailer', 'kind', 'bump', 'kid', 'original', 'grab', 'little', 'kid', 'original', 'michael', 'escape', 'ready', 'luck', 'imply', 'trailer', 'want', 'bring', 'shape', 'good', 'remember', 'michael', 'shape', 'fact', 'inhuman', 'know', 'human', 'speak', 'inhumanly', 'patient', 'insane', 'strength', 'normal', 'size', 'guy', 'literally', 'disappear', 'eye', 'eat', 'dog', 'nourishment', 'stab', 'neck', 'eye', 'gut', 'shoot', '6', 'time', 'kill', 'barely', 'slow', 'shape', 'kill', 'randomly', 'let', 'face', 'pretty', 'serial', 'killer', 'locker', 'hope', 'remember', 'michael', 'want', 'kill', 'bloodline', 'terrifying', 'unique', 'family', 'member', 'serial', 'killer', 'immune', 'action', 'michael', 'myers', 'case', 'main', 'target', 'think', 'michael', 'come', 'cos', 'myers', 'blood', 'wrong', 'halloween', 'film', 'stalk', 'kill', 'randomer', 'laurie', 'jamie', 'particular', 'favourite', 'h2', 'leave', 'elrod', 'notice', 'stalk', 'kill', 'alice', 'carpenter', 'write', 'film', 'sibling', 'sibling', 'actually', 'scary', 'haddonfield', 'represent', 'town', 'perfectly', 'regardless', 'bloodline', 'young', '17', 'female', 'particular', 'lol', 'michael', 'myers', 'shape', 'zombie']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"*JUST FOR FUN: I think then entire Halloween franchise would have ended with a beautiful bang if only Halloween Ressurection was better. Should have gone like this: Laurie ( a.ka. Kerry Tate ) kills the wrong guy in H20, so she is institutionalized. The real Michael finds her but she escapes. The murders of the hospital guards are aired on the news and Laurie is blamed because she has escaped. Meanwhile...her son John ( from H20 ) heard of this and is worried. He has heard bits and pieces of his mother being the sister of a crazed murderer, but he does not pry. He wants to forget it all and has tried to distance himself. But he has more to worry about because he has been tracked down...not by his knife wielding uncle, but by a young man who claims to be his nephew,and the son of Laurie's first child, Jamie Lloyd ( remember in Halloween 6, Jamie has a child before she is killed by Michael ). The young man explains to John that he was raised by his adopted parents ( Lindsey Wallace and Tommy Doyle. Tommy, whom Laurie babysat in the first Halloween film, is reintroduced as an adult in Halloween 6 ). The young man explains to John that his adoptive parents rescued him when he was an infant, as he was left in a train station bathroom by his mother , Jamie, who was trying to protect him from his murderous great uncle. His birth mother , Jamie, was killed by his great uncle , Michael Myers. The young man explains that he found out Jamie was his mother due to asking his parents. It was determined,somewhere in the time frame of part six, before he was adopted, that he was the son of Jamie Lloyd. The young man also learns that his adoptive father, Tommy,  had a small run in with Michael as a child in 1978 (Michael stalked his babysitter, Laurie Strode a.ka. Kerry Tate). John is in disbelief, but the young man has documented proof of this. Right when John is ready to deny all of this, as he wants no ties to a family haunted by grisly murders, his own mother Laurie ( Kerry ) finds him. She is dirty and shaken up from being on the run. John then questions his mother, informing her that the young man with him is her grandson, the child of her daughter Jamie; a daughter that she never talked about. John asks his mother why she kept his sister a secret.¬†Laurie explains that she gave up her daughter Jamie for adoption and faked her death because she was afraid Michael would come after her again. when this was done, she cut off all ties and was not aware that she had a grandson, or that her daughter was dead. The young man tells John and Laurie that he has always felt he had family elsewhere, and that he also felt like his life was always in danger, which drove him to track them down. Now that the family reunion has occurred, it is brought back to focus that Michael is still after Laurie, and so is the law. So Laurie, her son John, and her grandson (son of Jamie) all band together to end this family curse once and for all.

What you have to realize is that anyone can rip guts out of people, and in some movies in a clich√© overdramatize manner ..that makes them memorable..  like in Feddy with the whole ceiling kill. BUT Halloween was successful and became a cult film (with educational value) because it didn‚Äôt rely on a strange origin story or gore and kills. He is just a man and there are very few kills in the original. It is more about Michael‚Äôs voyeuristic qualities, his simplicity only using a mask and a basic kitchen knife, he doesn‚Äôt rely on long scary chases, there are no big boobed gals he goes after, and he‚Äôs not killing because he‚Äôs angry at someone (real targeting); he is a single minded animal (as stated in one of the films) so his kills are not grand, but effective and raw. Michael is a someone that can happen anywhere, at anytime, to anyone. The existence of Michael makes you look over your shoulder, to make you feel that someone/anyone is watching you, thinking about you, and you can‚Äôt tell. To remind you that there are in our reality human beings ‚Äòserial killers‚Äô with such a similar minds- Like most of them Michael just chose ‚Äúsomeone who was there‚Äù & we really don‚Äôt know why.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Okay. Here's how it goes. Michael Orby Myers was born on October 9, 1957 in Haddonfield, Illinois. When he was 6 on Halloween night in 1963, Wynn whispered in his ear to kill his family. He knew that the curse of thorn was already on him because he put it on him when he was born along with the mark. It went into effect that night when he whispered in his ear outside and it also made him mute. He killed his older sister Judith that night and was sent to Smith's Grove mental institution where he stayed for 15 years. Loomis was his psychiatrist and he tried to warn everyone about Michael but they already knew because they were all in on it. Michael knew that when he was 21 he would be tried as an adult and that he would have the strength to escape. He did so on October 30, 1978 and the next night went on his first killing spree in Haddonfield. He knew that Laurie was his little sister because she had come to visit him once. He failed to kill her because Loomis stepped in and saved her life. He was stabbed 3 times, shot 13 times and set on fire in an explosion before he fell and was stopped. If they would have let him burn he would have died right then and there. That's how you kill him. But they let him live and he spent 10 years in a coma at Ridgemont Sanitarium. Then they moved him out on October 30, 1988 and he escaped again. Meanwhile, Laurie had 3 children and moved to California with her son and one of her daughters. She left Jamie behind to carry on the family name in Haddonfield. Michael went after Jamie, failed to kill her and got filled full of holes. He spent another year in a coma, woke up and went after her again. He was captured but when set him free. They kidnapped Jamie and Michael raped her and get her pregnant. She and the baby escaped, Michael found her and killed her. Went after the baby and failed to kill him but killed Loomis, Wynn and everyone at Smith's Grove because he learned about what they had done to him. He knew Laurie was still alive and spent 4 years looking for her and going after her to end up stabbing her at her own mental institution where she was for killing an innocent man. He thought he killed her but she survived. He battled her in California and then again in Haddonfield then he went home and killed most of his Intruders. He was eletrecuted and burned in his garage but not enough to kill him. He laid there on the table, opened his eyes and groaned and now he has spent the last 15 years in a mental institution and Laurie has spent the last 15 years preparing to face him once again. She has her daughter and granddaughter left. Michael will be 61 when he escapes again and it's time to finish him once and for all. Disregard the Rob Zombie movies.

He was his doctor for 15 years. Wouldn't he just go find Laurie & get her into protective custody from Michael or something instead of roaming the streets of Haddonfield looking for him all day & night? But supposedly he only finds out about Laurie when Marion tells him in Halloween ll. You can tell it was sloppy storytelling. If you're keeping with the spirit of the original, then it makes a lot more sense that Michael Myers, who's been locked in an insane asylum staring a a wall for 15 years, sees this pretty girl on his front door step, becomes fixated on her & begins stalking her & her friends. Michael's actions was never meant to be fully understood or rationalized which is why the original Halloween purposely doesn't explore any motive for his killing & instead portrays him as this abstract evil.

Ted White, the man that played Jason Voorhees in Friday the 13th IV, was approximately 58 years old during the time of filming. Jackie Chan is 64. If real life men can be doing crazy stunts and running around all over the place in their late 50s/early 60s, I think Michael can _walk_ in his early 60s, especially when there is something supernatural about the guy.

Edit: Just look at the original movie though. Michael did nothing for 15 years except sit around staring at things. Then one night he springs to action, smashing car windows, breaking wooden doors, strangling and lifting a grown man and then pinning him to a wall with a butcher knife, strong enough to carry a tombstone and prop it up in a bedroom, etc, etc. If I spent 15 years sitting on my ass doing the bare minimum of physical activity, I'd be weak as hell. There's _something_ about the guy that's supernatural, just not to the degree that he's crushing skulls and surviving 5000 bullets.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"for fuck-sake, stop destroying this masterpiece already
The movie isn't even out-yet
And they still managed to show they had *NO UNDERSTANDING WHATSOEVER* of what made of Halloween one of the most celebrated horror-movie of all times
And no, putting ""Produced by John Carpenter"" and ""With Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode"" isn't enough to fool me

In this trailer, Michael just look like another retarded-slasher like Jason Voorhees
And don't get me wrong, i like Jason as much as the girl-next-door, but he's the exact opposite of Michael


What makes of Michael Myers one of the most Iconic horror-character ever
Is his cold, calculating, patient, creepy, and determined demeanor
He's a unstopable killing-machine, and you never know what goes into his head

He's scary not only because he dosn't show any form of emotions, reactions, or even hesitations in what he does
But because he's a methodic and smart killer
He go through great-lenght to find the best occasion to kill someone, and then does it without any form of hesitation and/or remorses
He'll spy on his victims without ever being seen, and then he'll get them as soon as they're isolated



He would never do something as stupid as killing someone in plain day while showing his murder-intents

The michael who try to scare a teenage-girl by banging on the toilet-door, and then throwing somes teeths at her
The michael who stab a dude in the back while looking straight at some girl in her car letting her plenty of time to press the honk 3 billions times to alert the whole fucking neighborhood
Isn't the Michael Myser who patiently waited for a girl to go to her car, slowly strangle her to death, and then move her body away because she pressed the klaxon

The mychael who goes around in the evening while wearing HIS FUCKING *MASK* EVEN THO' LAURIE FUCKING *KNOWS* HE'S OUT FOR HER
Isn't the same Michael who stayed in hidding, waiting for Halloween to come to use the occasion as a way to hide his identity with his terrifying mask


For fuck-sake, if you're gonna make another-remake/sequel again
At least try to understand the movie you're supposed to be working on...

If you're gonna go for the ""retarded killing-machine"" at least make a remake of Friday the 13th

It will never have the impact of the original because that can‚Äôt be replicated, but my god I think it will go toe to toe in every other department. And it has the added element of nostalgia. You can‚Äôt ask for any more than that. I just watched a trailer for Halloween H20 and although I enjoyed it at the time it looks like a made for TV movie by today‚Äôs standards. This trailer looks like it‚Äôs going back to some of the elements that made the original so compelling. Seeing Michael from afar like the scene at the window instead of in your face right away, leaving your imagination to scare you before slowly being relieved really has me excited for this movie.

 With original cast members and the best music I‚Äôve ever heard in a horror film, this has the makings of an absolute classic.

ek1ePFp-nBI,OMG YESS,
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Jeez, I can't believe I'm gonna say this...I mean, I echo what Carpenter always said: Halloween was special for what it was and it should've been left alone. (Akkad's bank account be damned!). What was a simple yet superb and horrifying film was turned into a tired joke after 4 sequels (so Myers only kills family members according to the constellation because a doctor with Druid fetish enlisted him to do so. Ummm, yeah. Here I was thinking MM was a force of evil psycho out killing randomly which is what made the concept so scary.) The retroactive and stillborn H20/Resurrection was lame, Scream-lite not worthy of the Halloween name. The Zombie films are fine on their own but abominations compared to JC's original. Really the ONLY good sequel was the Myers-less 3,...but...

Damn, does this look good! Granted it's still just Michael hacking up teens but it truly seems to be trying to get back to the spirit and atmosphere of the original (yeah, EVERY sequel's filmmaker said that but this time they appear to have achieved it). Hell, a few scenes in this trailer gave me chills! What the hell? I don't have super high hopes for it but it's the first time since Halloween 4 that I've truly been looking foward to a Halloween sequel! (Never though I'd say that.)

So glad they ditched the ""sister"" angle. Always hated that!

ek1ePFp-nBI,"There's a good chance that Michael is still Laurie's brother. They could be ""ignoring Halloween 2"" because near the end of that movie, the fact that Laurie is Michael's brother is revealed. If you recall, that information was never supposed to be revealed to Dr. Loomis. The new movie can go off the premiss that the lady that was sent for Loomis with the police officer kept her trap shut as ordered (and lets be honest, only a person with a proven track record for keeping their mouth shut and following orders is given that job in the first place). They could then use the big reveal of them being related as a plot point/twist in the new movie but I don't believe that is the case. In the trailer we also see Laurie training and preparing for what she seems to think (or hopes) is an inevitable show down with Michael. If she just happened to be one of the kids living in his old neighborhood the night he returned to commit his murder spree, this type of behavior wouldn't make much sense. Sure, she could be some off the reservation (ah la Tommy Doyle in 6) weirdo who was so traumatized by that night, she became obsessed with Michael and never truly moved on from that night even decades later. She wasn't renting a room near the Myers house collecting every newspaper and online article about Michael she could find. She has children and grandchildren and her own house. In that house is what appears to be some kind of hidden arsenal/panic room hidden under her kitchen island. In my opinion, they are ignoring or claiming to ignore the second movie to avoid the way people initially found out about the relation of Michael and Laurie. Maybe it is something revealed only to Laurie that night or shortly after when she turns 18. Michael could have known that was something she would learn on her 18th birthday and wanted to get to her before then and before her guard was up. Maybe it was something kept between Loomis an Laurie for the same reason it was kept secret in the first place. For the protection of her and eventually her family. Her daughter may have had to deal with some intense bullying or rumors but 40 years later it is believable for the granddaughter to be able to brush aside such a rumor. Especially if she herself didn't believe it to be true. Maybe the big reveal of the relation is made to the daughter and granddaughter after his escape after decades of denial by Laurie herself. I just don't believe all of the obsession and preparation by Laurie makes much sense if she believes she was just a random teenager who happened to be lucky and got away that night. No matter which way it goes im excited to see what this production group has for us and im almost certain we wont be disappointed.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I hate to be the voice of sharp criticism but being a huge Hllween fan it seems inevitable.
   One mistake up front. If you don't want your movie to be a one weekend B-movie, here today and gone next week you should make sure the dialogue is discernable. A bunch of scenes flash by and I'm lost, I can't understand what the characters are saying. 
   Second I'll say, I understand that they don't want to do the same thing, the same way and just make a repeat of what has been done before. That being said, you also don't want to lose the formula of a winning combination with too much reinvention. You have to stay true to some basic foundational elements and not throw them over like the Bond films have been attempting to do in recent decades.
   Here's the critique: It looks like they're trying to make ""Dirty Harry meets ""Psycho on the loose"" so they can appeal to a savvy new generation. (Now don't get me wrong, I know they've tried hard and it is hard. I'm not trying to kick the production in the teeth). 
   It looks like they've tried to turn Michael Myers into the thinking man's killer. If there was the one successful point about Michael Myers, it was his blissful absence of reason. He acted with purpose of which the audience knew not its origins. That drove his subtle rampage to heights of unimaginable terror. That chemistry should not be lost.
  In retrospect; a strong performance of a thinking man's killer is Richard Burton's performance in ""Hammersmith Is Out"". Although the film overall lacked in other areas.
   I predict I will probably give Halloween a thumbs-up for strong action sequences, with a marginal for various minor flaws. - LOLOL, LOLOL, LOLOL !","['hate', 'voice', 'sharp', 'criticism', 'huge', 'hllween', 'fan', 'inevitable', 'mistake', 'want', 'movie', 'weekend', 'b', 'movie', 'today', 'week', 'sure', 'dialogue', 'discernable', 'bunch', 'scene', 'flash', 'lose', 'understand', 'character', 'second', 'understand', 'want', 'thing', 'way', 'repeat', 'want', 'lose', 'formula', 'win', 'combination', 'reinvention', 'stay', 'true', 'basic', 'foundational', 'element', 'throw', 'like', 'bond', 'film', 'attempt', 'recent', 'decade', 'critique', 'look', 'like', 'try', 'dirty', 'harry', 'meet', 'psycho', 'loose', 'appeal', 'savvy', 'new', 'generation', 'wrong', 'know', 'try', 'hard', 'hard', 'try', 'kick', 'production', 'tooth', 'look', 'like', 'try', 'turn', 'michael', 'myers', 'thinking', 'man', 'killer', 'successful', 'point', 'michael', 'myers', 'blissful', 'absence', 'reason', 'act', 'purpose', 'audience', 'know', 'origin', 'drive', 'subtle', 'rampage', 'height', 'unimaginable', 'terror', 'chemistry', 'lose', 'retrospect', 'strong', 'performance', 'thinking', 'man', 'killer', 'richard', 'burton', 'performance', 'hammersmith', 'film', 'overall', 'lack', 'area', 'predict', 'probably', 'halloween', 'thumb', 'strong', 'action', 'sequence', 'marginal', 'minor', 'flaw', 'lolol', 'lolol', 'lolol']"

it seems like filmmakers don't usually want to make an ultra dark anti-hero/slasher movie too scared of backlash? its been done in video games.
for them to take away the whole series even the good/bad bits is an easy thing for directors and writers to do these days. no new interesting ideas they could've done a way more interesting spin off however the creative movie people pay little attention to spin offs instead we get reboots/remakes.
Although i will give this a watch eventually I personally don't like the direction this movie is taking (in this trailer) actually showing where hes from takes a lot of mystery away. plus this story just looks like anti-everything i just mentioned above. looks like it is focusing mainly on Laurie strode battle hardened heroine. not the story i had hoped for as a fan.

I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized what was living behind that boy‚Äôs eyes was purely and simply‚Ä¶ evil.

Also, if he was 6 when he killed, or at least when Loomis met him wouldn't he be 46? I guess they are just going with the baby sitting kills from the 78 original when he was 21.

ek1ePFp-nBI,Otha fuck,
ek1ePFp-nBI,I got goosebumps at 1:56,
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Whilst I do applaud the filmmakers for much of the content in this trailer for the new Halloween movie (The return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, going back to Michael Myers origins and creating a far-superior follow up to the original), I do have some issues with it:

1) Asking your audience to basically forget what happened in Halloween 2-6, H20, Resurrection and the two Rob Zombie remakes is a lot. I do understand that they're essentially trying to wipe the slate clean with the Halloween film franchise, it's pretty difficult as a long-time Halloween fan to simply unlearn and forget about important plot details.

2) Following on from this, the writers are also trying hard to deny any connection or relation between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode being siblings. Again this is also difficult when it's been the case for most of Halloween's history that Michael and Laurie are brother and sister. It also gives Myers a genuine motive for hunting after her 40 years later. Otherwise this plot detail makes no sense whatsoever.

3) Calling this film HALLOWEEN is very confusing as it implies that this is indeed a reboot or remake of the original. They really should have stuck to the original title of HALLOWEEN RETURNS or even HALLOWEEN H40.

Otherwise, I'm really excited about a new Halloween film finally being released. Unlike some of the shoddy sequels before it, it seems like a lot more thought has gotten into the storyline and production. And unlike the dreadful Michael and Laurie confrontation in Halloween: Resurrection, it seems like it will be handled a lot better here.

I was in my younger years almost addicted to horror movies, and John Carpenter was one of my favorite directors. Flicks like ""The Fog"", ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"" was (and still is) among the geatest in its genre.
But when I got older, I asked myself ""why the fuck do I watch these kind of movies""? The answere? It was a coping mechanism for dealing with psychological disharmony and the underlying fear of death. It doesn`t make life any better watching people stabbing eachother to death, I promise you. The more junk you feed into your brain, the more you become incapable of thinking clearly about REAL LIFE.
Jamie Lee Curtis is a very good actress with alot of success, but like most actors, she became addicted to attention and fame, and some of them (like Curtis) can`t stand the thought of being totally forgotten. Only desperation and alot of money makes Curtis dive into a shithole like this, and its fucking sad and pathetic.


Ask yourself honestly and with deep curiousity:  Why watch a movie that makes you stupid, when you can read books about real life psychopathic killers and really learn something about the people that inspires moviedirectors to make shit like this. Its fucking primitive!

 - Monster/Bad Guy laughs like demon
 - Old lady that knows everything 
 - Being swept on the floor by the monster
 - The suspense violin
 - Edited in Zoom ins
 - Slowly walking in and seeing a dead body, but stupidly continues to press forward 
 - Monster having psychological issues or giving the characters psychological issues
 - The researcher if the movie is lucky enough to not have the old lady or just does
 - The fucking idiot chick that says ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù while the monster is near
- the whole movie if it has 5 or more of these cliches 
- The fans

The scene at the asylum with the chess flooring does not sit well with me...yet. Nor that he simply was locked up for 40 years. If there's no family relation, it changes the entire dynamic of the series. Also, it opens up another continuity in the series:

ek1ePFp-nBI,My opinion as a late 20 something is I am SO HAPPY to see a movie that is not centred around another young actor. It becomes too much of the same same. I like age diversity. Besides I can‚Äôt stand horror movies where the lead is some young thing with his or her chest out as bait. I‚Äôm watching it for horror. This trailer looks like the scare comes from suspense which is my kind of horror movie. Plus I think it‚Äôs iconic to see Jamie Lee Curtis return as Laurie Strode. I literally don‚Äôt care if people disagree with me. I just wanted to put my comment out there with the ones telling Jamie to hang it up. My comment is go get it girl! It‚Äôs nice to see people not being boxed in. We are all going to be older one day. I‚Äôve always been able to relate & like other people via personality not age & that‚Äôs why I am glad to see some mature actors that I adore still getting parts.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Looks awful. I know the explanation is that Michael was apprehended in the original, and this is a sequel that takes place after the original, and completely ignores anything after the original. But these changes seem more pointless than anything.

Laurie strode not being his sister was a dumb decision, now he has almost no reason to go after her besides ""he be fucked up and want to kill people.""

Atleast with her being his sister you could say that he wanted to end his bloodline or some shit which actually gives him a semblance of a reason to actually go after her. A reason that anyway has more depth than ""He's a nut, crazy in the coconut."" and just likes to kill random babies sitters because whatever else he was doing just got boring to him.

And for a movie that is supposed to be a sequel to the original, it honestly looked like a remake of the original.

Now that I know it's a sequel that takes place 40 years after the original, alot of this is starting to make more sense. But that still doesn't explain the unneeded retconning done. 

If they retconned the whole ""Michael is controlled by a cult"" shit then that'd be fine. Or at the very least try to write that plot element better. But don't retcon stuff like the blood relations between him and Laurie that gave him a reason to go after her. That's just so dumb, and unneeded. I'll give this movie a shot but it just doesn't look like it'll be very good.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Judging from some of the responses, it seems that most of the casual Halloween audience completely misunderstand the original mythos of the first Halloween and direction Carpenter took it, and why there isn't a brother-sister connection between Michael & Laurie. In the original film there was not one indication that Laurie and Michael were related. He only pursued her and stalked her friends (Annie, Lynda, and Bob) just for the sake of it and because he was the embodiment of evil as explained by Dr. Loomis. Monsters like that have no actual real motive for their actions. The story taking place on Halloween just adds on to the terror since the holiday was already perceived as the ""scariest night of the year"" where crazies come out and do things they wouldn't normally do on other days. Michael is a reflection of all that, and of the urban legend of the mysterious stalker creeping on the babysitter. I'm not sure about anyone else, but the removal of the brother-sister relation makes things more unpredictable in my opinion and why this film will be a huge success.","['judge', 'response', 'casual', 'halloween', 'audience', 'completely', 'misunderstand', 'original', 'mythos', 'halloween', 'direction', 'carpenter', 'brother', 'sister', 'connection', 'michael', 'laurie', 'original', 'film', 'indication', 'laurie', 'michael', 'relate', 'pursue', 'stalk', 'friend', 'annie', 'lynda', 'bob', 'sake', 'embodiment', 'evil', 'explain', 'dr.', 'loomis', 'monster', 'like', 'actual', 'real', 'motive', 'action', 'story', 'place', 'halloween', 'add', 'terror', 'holiday', 'perceive', 'scary', 'night', 'year', 'crazy', 'come', 'thing', 'normally', 'day', 'michael', 'reflection', 'urban', 'legend', 'mysterious', 'stalker', 'creep', 'babysitter', 'sure', 'removal', 'brother', 'sister', 'relation', 'thing', 'unpredictable', 'opinion', 'film', 'huge', 'success']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I have a theory about the Halloween franchise going forward... With the recent popularity of  shared universes in movie franchises and the anthology format with American Horror story, what if this sequel also acts as a soft reboot to the the original concept behind the start of the Halloween franchise. The REAL Halloween franchise we never got. 

Before this sounds too irrational, Blumhouse is producing this and I wouldn't be suprised if they were currently trying to come up with a countermove to rival the domination that Atomic monster (The James Wan company behind The conjuring shared universe) has over the horror genre as of late. If so, then what better way is there to do that, now that they have the Halloween rights as well as people passionate about the story in control.

So this is where connected franchises tie in, obviously we all know Halloween was meant to be an anthology, but it wouldn't be too hard to wrap that idea with a snug shared universe bow. They're bankable, more entertaining, and The conjuring is proof that it works. So who knows, they're probably planning the anthology shared universe Halloween series with this as a bridge, acting as a secret reboot to start the new series and a sequel that closes the old convoluted story they started but never got to finish so very long ago. It would be an honest, downright quick and easy way to make a huge horror franchise successful. Well, successful AGAIN. Anyway the chances are slim, but if blumhouse knew what they were doing, this would be genius. 

Plus this way we would get so many original, great modern horror movies from not only The conjuring, but Halloween. Michael myers could make cameos or at the very least easter eggs, and they could always bring him back for however many sequels. It could be like how The conjuring series still continues the story of the Warren's in between all of their spinoffs. It's like a hybrid combination of an anthology and shared universe. Once again this is just a dream of mine lol sadly I doubt it'll happen, but I had to share the idea of it. It'd be so perfect, and exactly what we need right now.

Also I forgot to add this in my comment, but the fact that the movie is titled just ""Halloween"" is one of the biggest reasons I think this movie is a soft reboot. It could've been Halloween 2, or Halloween with a subtitle, but they chose Halloween.","['theory', 'halloween', 'franchise', 'forward', '...', 'recent', 'popularity', 'share', 'universe', 'movie', 'franchise', 'anthology', 'format', 'american', 'horror', 'story', 'sequel', 'act', 'soft', 'reboot', 'original', 'concept', 'start', 'halloween', 'franchise', 'real', 'halloween', 'franchise', 'sound', 'irrational', 'blumhouse', 'produce', 'suprise', 'currently', 'try', 'come', 'countermove', 'rival', 'domination', 'atomic', 'monster', 'james', 'wan', 'company', 'conjuring', 'share', 'universe', 'horror', 'genre', 'late', 'way', 'halloween', 'right', 'people', 'passionate', 'story', 'control', 'connect', 'franchise', 'tie', 'obviously', 'know', 'halloween', 'mean', 'anthology', 'hard', 'wrap', 'idea', 'snug', 'share', 'universe', 'bow', 'bankable', 'entertaining', 'conjuring', 'proof', 'work', 'know', 'probably', 'plan', 'anthology', 'share', 'universe', 'halloween', 'series', 'bridge', 'act', 'secret', 'reboot', 'start', 'new', 'series', 'sequel', 'close', 'old', 'convoluted', 'story', 'start', 'finish', 'long', 'ago', 'honest', 'downright', 'quick', 'easy', 'way', 'huge', 'horror', 'franchise', 'successful', 'successful', 'chance', 'slim', 'blumhouse', 'know', 'genius', 'plus', 'way', 'original', 'great', 'modern', 'horror', 'movie', 'conjuring', 'halloween', 'michael', 'myer', 'cameo', 'easter', 'egg', 'bring', 'sequel', 'like', 'conjure', 'series', 'continue', 'story', 'warren', 'spinoff', 'like', 'hybrid', 'combination', 'anthology', 'share', 'universe', 'dream', 'lol', 'sadly', 'doubt', 'happen', 'share', 'idea', 'perfect', 'exactly', 'need', 'right', 'forgot', 'add', 'comment', 'fact', 'movie', 'title', 'halloween', 'big', 'reason', 'think', 'movie', 'soft', 'reboot', 'halloween', '2', 'halloween', 'subtitle', 'choose', 'halloween']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,This looks awesome. Finally a sequel worth waiting for. Ok folks this new movie is a direct sequel to the 1978 film. Why? Because all the other films (why most of them.being great) make no sense. And would confuse the audience. They would have to ignore the last 2 films and make this take place after 8. But Jamie Lee died so that cant happen either. So make it take place after h20. But it's been 20 yrs since that film and it's about keeping the same audience while also getting new fans. This new movie is gonna attract new fans to the franchise .blame rob zombie if you hate this new sequel. And to have carpenter back is amazing. And the ORIGINAL actor who played Myers in 78 is back to play him again. And yes Michael would be about 65 yrs old. Same age as the actor who's playing him. So it's a perfect fit. Danny McBride is a longtime fan of Halloween so he made this film as a FAN. this movie is gonna be AWSOME!!!!!,"['look', 'awesome', 'finally', 'sequel', 'worth', 'wait', 'ok', 'folk', 'new', 'movie', 'direct', 'sequel', '1978', 'film', 'film', 'them.bee', 'great', 'sense', 'confuse', 'audience', 'ignore', '2', 'film', 'place', '8', 'jamie', 'lee', 'die', 'happen', 'place', 'h20', '20', 'yrs', 'film', 'audience', 'new', 'fan', 'new', 'movie', 'attract', 'new', 'fan', 'franchise', '.blame', 'rob', 'zombie', 'hate', 'new', 'sequel', 'carpenter', 'amazing', 'original', 'actor', 'play', 'myers', '78', 'play', 'yes', 'michael', '65', 'yrs', 'old', 'age', 'actor', 'play', 'perfect', 'fit', 'danny', 'mcbride', 'longtime', 'fan', 'halloween', 'film', 'fan', 'movie', 'awsome']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping people from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous.

This movie will be great, but I'm not too impressed with the story. When they said Michael was in Asylum for 40 years... They basically cut all of the other movies. Number two - Halloween Resurrection never happened.

See if they would of thought a better story they could of cut Halloween resurrection rather than the whole franchise. Here's why: 

When Halloween H20 came out Michael Sister was more prepared in that movie, and was ready. When she hiding behind the curtens ( sorry for not spelling it right.) she stabbed him over I believe 10 times, and Michael Myers tripped 3 stories down, and got knocked out cold by landing on the table. They should of ended it by the cops arresting Michael, and putting him into the crazy asylum for 20 years. That would make more sense rather than killing off 4 movies even though 3 of them didn't really matter. I just hope there's more into the story because I think they really ruined the franchise by doing this.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I remember there was an abandoned home on the outskirts of Lexington South Carolina that they turned into a haunted house around Halloween. Well while you‚Äôre waiting in line, they have tall big dudes walking around in these coveralls and Michael masks and a fake knife. Me being a kid at the time didn‚Äôt know this, and I remember going to the restrooms which were port o johns near the outskirts of the whole compound (which had lighting, haystacks and generators, etc.) bUt it was within view of the main line. Anyway when I was taking a dump due to being really nervous it got very quiet. The talks from the main line stopped and it was just the hums of the generators. I felt this warmth go over me and I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. When I went to open the door, it didn‚Äôt really open, so I pushed harder. Harder. Finally frustrated and feeing a sense of panic, I just threw all my body weight into the door, and I came busting out. Right when i started looking up, this Big tall figure was standing directly in front of me. It was Michael. It was the first time I ever saw him or what he was. I felt my entire body just give out from under me. I was border lining fainting. I could feel my legs buckle. Luckily he caught me instead of letting me fall since I was probably only 10-11 years old. Everyone thought it was hilarious. Whole line of probably 50+ people just started laughing; My parents too. I‚Äôll never forget that feeling. Everytime I see this dude I can smell that dudes coveralls and I feel a subtle sense of panic lingering.

Also, I hope this movie has an old-fashioned realistic feel and limits technological tricks and special effects. One reservation I have is not including Halloween 2 (1981). I feel like the first two movies are edged in peoples' minds as being one movie. I understand John Carpenter not liking the sister thing he came up with while drunk. Also, perhaps he did not like a supernatural Myers. However, Myers was shot six times, poked in the eye, stabbed in the stomach, etc... The fact that he got up and walked away makes him supernatural. Also, if he is coming after Laurie Strode again it takes away the randomness element that Carpenter said he liked rather than chasing his sister. Personally, I thought Halloween 2 was enjoyable.

So we'll meet Laurie and her family on a nice normal day in the few days leading up to Halloween.  The doctor/documentary dude goes to Laurie's home to ask for an interview.  She denies him or gives him a speach.  the documentary team go to Smith's Grove State Hospital and meets Myers and they get freaked out.  They move the prisoners for some reason and Michael escapes.  The documentary crew ends up at same gas station Myers is hiding. (These two things can be flip flopped.) He gets his uniform, mask, and makes the documentary team temporarily believe in the boogeyman.  First 20 minutes right there. 

Michael shows up on Halloween day, stocks Laurie's granddaughter and her friends.  He kills the one girl in yellow, puts her on a chair with a white blanket. Laurie is somehow informed of this, probably due to the sheriff deputy standing in the room on the far side in blue lighting when she takes a crack shot at the mirror. 

No one else sees him. She gets told she's crazy.  Her daughter and husband takes Laurie and Granddaughter back to Laurie's where Michael follows. He kills Laurie's son in law, they run around the house for a while. Laurie has a 1v1 with Michael, eventually he gets the best of her.  The granddaughter steps in and gets the kill.  Holds mamaw in her arms as she dies. 

Police finally show up.  The ending  is left ambiguous, maybe, for one more sequel if this one is a giant success, which it is looking like it is going to be.","['hate', 'trailer', 'tell', 'movie', 'plot', 'hope', 'leave', 'hide', 'goody', 'tell', 'movie', 'happen', 'meet', 'laurie', 'family', 'nice', 'normal', 'day', 'day', 'lead', 'halloween', 'doctor', 'documentary', 'dude', 'laurie', 'home', 'ask', 'interview', 'deny', 'speach', 'documentary', 'team', 'smith', 'grove', 'state', 'hospital', 'meet', 'myers', 'freak', 'prisoner', 'reason', 'michael', 'escape', 'documentary', 'crew', 'end', 'gas', 'station', 'myers', 'hide', 'thing', 'flip', 'flop', 'uniform', 'mask', 'documentary', 'team', 'temporarily', 'believe', 'boogeyman', '20', 'minute', 'right', 'michael', 'halloween', 'day', 'stock', 'laurie', 'granddaughter', 'friend', 'kill', 'girl', 'yellow', 'chair', 'white', 'blanket', 'laurie', 'informed', 'probably', 'sheriff', 'deputy', 'stand', 'room', 'far', 'blue', 'lighting', 'crack', 'shot', 'mirror', 'tell', 'crazy', 'daughter', 'husband', 'laurie', 'granddaughter', 'laurie', 'michael', 'follow', 'kill', 'laurie', 'son', 'law', 'run', 'house', 'laurie', '1v1', 'michael', 'eventually', 'good', 'granddaughter', 'step', 'kill', 'holds', 'mamaw', 'arm', 'die', 'police', 'finally', 'ending', 'leave', 'ambiguous', 'maybe', 'sequel', 'giant', 'success', 'look', 'like']"

For the wrath of God 
is revealed from heaven 


against all ungodliness 
and unrighteousness of men, 


who hold the truth in unrighteousness;


Because that which may be known of God 
is manifest in them; 


for God hath shewed it unto them.


For the invisible things of him 
from the creation of the world 
are clearly seen, 


being understood 
by the things that are made, 


even his eternal power 
and Godhead; 


so that they 


are without excuse:


(Romans 1:18-20).


***Having departed from godliness and righteousness, people suppress the truth about God: 

That God is their loving Creator and deserves their worship and praise. 

Sinful people can mentally perceive the revealed truth of God, but they chosen to suppress it. 

They are without excuse.
Gods anger is being revealed 

against sin and the suppression of the truth. 


***(What may be known of God): Not only are divine attributes clearly seen in humanity, but they can be seen in the material universe as well.


***Nature itself speaks eloquently of its Creator. From the intricate design of the human cell to the majestic strength of the Rock Mountains, all God's works testify to his wisdom and power. 


***God's invisible attributes, such as his eternal power and Godhead, meaning his divine nature, can be clearly seen by contemplating his awesome works in all of creation. 


***And then shall that Wicked one/Anti-Christ be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they (received not) the (love of the truth), that they (might be saved). And for this cause (God) (shall send them) (strong delusion), that (they) (should believe a lie): That they all might be damned who (believed not the truth), but had (pleasure) in (unrighteousness). (2 Thessalonians 2:8-12).

ek1ePFp-nBI,"My name is Dr. William Ferraiolo. I have twenty five years of experience teaching, researching, and publishing articles in academic journals. I have authored a book which contains a collection of meditations in the Stoic tradition that I believe would be an excellent addition to your library (or your own reading material). This collection is unique in that each meditation is presented in the second person, encouraging the reader to examine their struggles and failures in the pursuit of self-improvement and enlightenment. The following is a sample meditation that illustrates this:

‚ÄúEverything that can suffer, does suffer. Everything that can die, will die. You have suffered, you will suffer much more, and a lifetime of your suffering will culminate in your death. When you can muster genuine gratitude for all of that, then you will have made the kind of progress that is not easily reversed. To develop sincere appreciation for this opportunity to be born in a brutal world, not of your making, to struggle and fail time and time again, to feel repeatedly lost, bewildered, frustrated, and hopeless, to swim in this ocean of misery, and, ultimately, to drown in it‚Äîthis is the beginning of wisdom. You must embodyoverwhelming gratitude for the opportunity to fail repeatedly, with no guarantee of eventual success, and to wade cheerfully into a doomed struggle against time and your own limitations.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I see a few comments where some of you guys are genuinely confused about the trailer. What we are looking at is an alternate timeline that stems straight from the 1978 Halloween film. This is the sequel to the original, meaning they are ignoring the other Halloween films, but reference a few moments from the other Halloween movies in the new film (*Michael killing the people in the diner is a reference to Halloween 4: Return of Michael Myers; the dropping teeth over the lady's bathroom stall is a reference to the bathroom scene with the woman and her little girl from Halloween: H20; the little boy bumping into Michael is reference from Halloween 2 (1980), and the patients almost getting run over in the street is a reference to Halloween (1978) when Michael escapes and let's out the other patients as a distraction).

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Sorry guys but John Carpenter had it right the first time. After the first movie, he had said that he realized there was no more story to his idea. So in order to do a sequel and give the idea/movie more story, he had them be brother and sister and gave us the family element. And he was right, it gave his whole idea more STORY. Otherwise, it's just Michael going after random people for no reason. Now look at what he is doing... He's doing a sequel with that SAME IDEA that has no more story. Just Michael going after strangers for no reason. He did the right thing making them brother and sister because it gave this awesome series a REAL on going story. 

Do you really want Halloween to be like Friday the 13th? Where Jason just kills random people for no god damn reason? There is literally NO STORY in those movies. It's LITERALLY the same thing every movie: People show up at camp. Jason kills them. Parts 1-4 painfully did that. Come on. 5-7 did the same thing as well. 8 finally tried to be different by changing location and scenery but it was still the same thing. Part 9 is actually the only one with a real story. As it wasn't just about Jason killing random people at the camp because he feels like it.

Would you guys really be okay with every Halloween movie being like that? Michael appears on Halloween and goes after random people for no reason? Then does the same thing to different people in the next one? Again for no reason? With no real connection from movie to movie. Them being brother and sister gave this series a real exciting story. Not to mention we had Loomis hunting him down in every movie, providing real continuity. And we saw recurring characters who really mattered to the story and Michael's motive. Not just random dumb camp counselors.

Also, this movie is going to be a complete waste. It's pretty clear based on the trailer that this is going to be a remake of the first movie. Just 40 years later and everyone is older. Come on, Michael starts out locked up at Smith's Grove, escapes, and goes back to Haddonfield on Halloween to kill teenagers. Really? Sound familiar? All he is doing is remaking the first movie with the same idea that has no more story to it. Okay, so he took away the family aspect? Why? So instead of Michael escaping to pursue his sister, he's escaping to pursue a stranger? Like why is that going to be any different? Instead of talking about how much Laurie escaped her brother, she'll be talking about how much she escaped a strange serial killer. Big wow. The brother/sister element made all of this a lot better.

And the second anyone ever says the words: ""Those movies never happened."" You're not making things better. You're making things worse. It's the worst thing any writer or creative person can do. Why would you build up this long franchise with such a major history and so many plots/characters advancing and moving forward, to just one day saying, ""Oh yea, by the way, those movies never happened."" Why does anyone think that is a good idea and why is even one person happy about that happening? And just because you get one not so well received movie like Resurrection, that doesn't mean you just give up, start all over and pretend the whole series never happened. LOL. Give me a break.

It's a huge mistake ignoring this entire series that we have spent YEARS and YEARS following. What a bitch slap to our faces. This easily could be a Halloween 9 if they would just acknowledge every damn movie and give a simple explanation as to how Laurie didn't really die in Resurrection. There was no need to approach this movie ignoring the other ones. None at all. And please, that line in the trailer about them being brother and sister being a ""rumor"" Are you fucking serious? That was no rumor. That was the real cannon story people. The only ""rumor"" should have been Thorn controlling Michael. See how simple it would be to tie all the movies together? LINES OF DIALOGUE. John Carpenter did not need to ignore this entire franchise to make this movie. So aggravating. And taking away the family element wasn't necessary either and was a huge mistake.

And um... They're going to be throwing a ""nod"" to the other movies while ignoring them at the same time? Are they fucking serious? Why not ""nod"" to them in a way that confirms they ALL HAPPENED! So they're going to ""nod"" to movies they claim never happened? LOL. So fucking dumb. Wow. This movie can be everything John Carpenter wants it to be, only it acknowledges every movie. Making this a TRUE sequel. I think these people need to learn how to reboot and continue at the same time. And not just rebooting to the point where you're wiping things clean.

Do you have any idea how more excited people would be if this trailer actually took place after all the other movies? By not doing that people's level of excitement has gone way down. But yes, I still see how excited people are and guess what? I'm excited too. But when I first heard Jamie Lee Curtis was coming back I was VERY happy about it until I learned they were ignoring the other movies and my level of excitement went way down.

And sadly guys... The only movie that's going to end up being ignored is this one. Cause we'll just end up getting a Halloween 9 one day anyway. And again, THIS movie now could be Halloween 9 if it simply acknowledged every movie.

For the record, I think this trailer looks awesome and I AM excited to see it and I WILL see it when it comes out. This really does look good. But it is too damn frustrating when I follow a long running series like this just to find out the whole damn thing is being ignored. There is never any need for that. Ever. They cannot ""Days of Future Past"" their way out of this. What's done is done.

i see it looks to be ignoring parts 2,4,5,6,8 (and part 3 had nothing to do with Michael Myers) 
but in this trailer it says that Lorie is not Michael's sister.. but in H20 Michael is Lorie's sister and Lorie has a son and in this movie they say Lorie is someones grandmother .. which would go along with her having a son.. 

so what is the official cannon ? is it '78, 2, H2O, 2018? 
or is it just '78, 2018? 
or is it '78, H20, 2018?

seriously i really hate it when companies fuck up a time line this bad with movie monsters...
it happens all the time too .. 
NOES did it 
Hellraiser did it
even the old monster movies did it like the Frankenstein and Dracula and Wolfman series ... but that is excusable since back then they didnt have VCRs DVDs or BluRays to rewatch and coherently connect the movies 
even Friday the 13th did it with Mrs. Voorhees's grave putting the wrong year on the tombstone  (it should say 1980 but it says 1979 other than that the Friday the 13th time line is pretty solid Jason has the damage from the previous movies in the right places his change of clothes is explained the only other thing that is messed up is him getting a new hockey mask with the same ax mark ... you'd think when he got a new mask he would either choose a different mask or if he sticks with the hockey mask that it wouldnt have the ax mark in the left side of his head..but as far as the story time line it all is in the right spots...)

Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a big dream >_<
I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM* I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 31k comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!). 

*FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen. ""Markiplier's Let's Play Slender The Arrival!"" I was so excited because I LOVED Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. (Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!). 

As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos WHENEVER I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. (SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!) 

So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. TakeTheJurny, because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice. No one has to sub I just wanted everyone to have a chance to see my Youtube before it hits 1million, and that will happen one day :) thanks for reading, and as always I will see you, when I heed the call, to the next Journey, Adios guys! <3 and thanks so much for reading!","['hey', 'hi', 'takethejurny', 'fellow', 'small', 'youtuber', 'big', 'dream', 'explain', 'mean', 'time', 'read', 'comment', 'know', 'probably', 'ready', 'different', 'video', 'maybe', 'look', 'phone', 'mean', 'lot', 'society', 'time', 'precious', 'thank', 'reading', 'attention', 'm', 'mhm', 'work', 'hard', 'youtube', 'fear', 'new', 'rule', 'regulation', 'terrible', 'adpocalypse', 'hard', 'surpass', 'classic', 'viral', 'video', 'decide', 'comment', 'viral', 'video', 'yes', 'advertising', 'hear', 'right', '31k', 'comment', 'video', 'single', 'person', 'comment', 'video', 'comment', 'look', 'channel', 'subscribe', 'literally', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'mean', 'think', 'second', 'work', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'ask', 'subscribe', 'want', 'people', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'work', 'sub', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'try', 'find', 'fast', 'easy', 'way', 'chance', 'work', 'enjoy', 'chance', 'grow', 'youtuber', 'let', 'rephrase', 'dream', 'truly', 'understand', 'goal', '...', '(also', 'thank', 'read', 'flashback', 'narration', 'scene', 'little', 'kid', 'rough', 'childhood', 'father', 'hurt', 'mom', '13', 'crappy', 'year', 'crazy', 'right', 'finally', 'shake', 'mom', 'leave', 'love', 'dad', 'stay', 'totally', 'suck', 'constantly', 'hurt', 'want', 'detailed', 'kid', 'reading--', 'anyways', 'plus', 'outcasted', 'classmate', 'school', 'pretty', 'stuck', 'watch', 'netflix', 'eat', 'fun', 'time', 'hard', 'bright', 'thing', 'lose', 'hope', 'sink', 'deep', 'sort', 'young', 'depression', 'find', '..', 'watch', 'youtube', 'time', 'think', 'kind', 'bore', 'tbh', 'cry', 'day', 'look', 'enjoyment', 'screen', 'markiplier', 'let', 'play', 'slender', 'arrival', 'excited', 'love', 'slenderman', 'mind', 'click', 'know', 'happen', '...', 'happen', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'hey', 'thumb', 'read', 'know', 'lot', 'sorry', 'watch', 'markiplier', 'listen', 'positive', 'glow', 'bright', 'booming', 'smile', 'squeal', 'different', 'thing', 'game', 'notice', 'start', 'change', 'stop', 'cry', 'smile', 'focused', 'laugh', 'video', 'watch', 'video', 'sad', 'unhappy', 'video', 'fail', 'lift', 'cleanse', 'darkness', 'wander', 'dark', 'corner', 'bravely', 'wander', 'like', 'family', 'want', 'share', 'feeling', 'happiness', 'feeling', 'peace', 'chaos', 'want', 'like', 'happy', 'positive', 'sort', 'universal', 'truth', 'peace', 'wonderful', 'family', 'want', 'want', 'smile', 'laugh', 'bad', 'day', 'family', 'sorry', ""i'll"", 'hurry', 'dang', 'read', 'wow', 'dream', 'markiplier', 'light', 'person', 'darkness', 'want', 'laugh', 'bring', 'youtube', 'takethejurny', 'life', 'journey', 'want', 'spam', 'choice', 'sub', 'want', 'chance', 'youtube', 'hit', '1million', 'happen', 'day', ':)', 'thank', 'reading', 'heed', 'journey', 'adios', 'guy', '<3', 'thank', 'read']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"In Congress, July 4, 1776
The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚ÄîThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚ÄîThat whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. ‚ÄîSuch has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount an payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred. to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. ‚ÄîAnd for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

This won‚Äôt be one of those ‚ÄúThe Purge‚Äù moments or fake horror films. This will be a great homage to what Carpenter started back in ‚Äò78 with Halloween.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"Yes, the trailer is finally here, and the Boogeyman is back! Michael Myers is BACK!
...
On a more serious note, I loved the trailer and I'm so exited to see Jamie and Nick reprising their roles as Laurie and Michael in this new installment of the series, makes me wish Donald would also return to reprise his role as Loomis, God the nostalgia is real! 

But, as much as I loved this trailer, it did leave me with a couple of questions regarding the timeline of the films. I'm guessing this film is set in a brand new timeline, separate from ""The Return of Michael Myers (1988)"" and ""H20 (1998)"" timelines, and only following the events of the original ""Halloween (1978)"" and ""Halloween II (1981)."" 

Laurie died pretty early in ""The Return of Michael Myers"" timeline, causing Michael to awaken from his coma in the first place, that and also the fact he learned about Jamie's existence, speaking of Jamie, she also died, at the beginning of ""The Curse of Michael Myers (1995),"" so there's no possible way this film belongs in that timeline if Laurie is still alive and she has a daughter, who's not Jamie. The ""H20"" timeline is also out of the question, since Laurie died at the beginning of ""Resurrection (2002)"" and she had a son, John, who's not a girl. 

Now that I'm analyzing all of this pretty carefully, I'm realizing that it's pretty evident this film is set in a separate timeline from the other two, so I pretty much just stated the obvious... but you know what? I don't care, I love analyzing timelines anyway, this was fun for me. I am kinda disappointed we will never get to expand on the Cult of Thorn and the curse within Michael himself, they were such fascinating concepts in my opinion and it's a shame they were only touched on in one film and teased in the previous one to that one, but that doesn't change the fact that Michael Myers is finally back to Haddonfield for more screams and blood, and we're gonna see Laurie act like a total badass! 

I only ask for one thing in this film: please give us what should've been the conclusion to the original ""Halloween"" franchise in ""Halloween II"" and the ""H20"" timeline, Laurie finally taking down her bloodthirsty, psychotic brother once and for all, avenging all the innocent lives he has taken, including those closest and dearest to Laurie herself, that's a truly satisfying conclusion in my opinion.","['yes', 'trailer', 'finally', 'boogeyman', 'michael', 'myers', '...', 'note', 'love', 'trailer', 'exited', 'jamie', 'nick', 'reprise', 'role', 'laurie', 'michael', 'new', 'installment', 'series', 'wish', 'donald', 'return', 'reprise', 'role', 'loomis', 'god', 'nostalgia', 'real', 'love', 'trailer', 'leave', 'couple', 'question', 'regard', 'timeline', 'film', 'guess', 'film', 'set', 'brand', 'new', 'timeline', 'separate', 'return', 'michael', 'myers', '1988', 'h20', '1998', 'timeline', 'follow', 'event', 'original', 'halloween', '1978', 'halloween', 'ii', '1981', 'laurie', 'die', 'pretty', 'early', 'return', 'michael', 'myers', 'timeline', 'cause', 'michael', 'awaken', 'coma', 'place', 'fact', 'learn', 'jamie', 'existence', 'speak', 'jamie', 'die', 'beginning', 'curse', 'michael', 'myers', '1995', 'possible', 'way', 'film', 'belong', 'timeline', 'laurie', 'alive', 'daughter', 'jamie', 'h20', 'timeline', 'question', 'laurie', 'die', 'beginning', 'resurrection', '2002', 'son', 'john', 'girl', 'analyze', 'pretty', 'carefully', 'realize', 'pretty', 'evident', 'film', 'set', 'separate', 'timeline', 'pretty', 'state', 'obvious', '...', 'know', 'care', 'love', 'analyze', 'timeline', 'fun', 'kinda', 'disappointed', 'expand', 'cult', 'thorn', 'curse', 'michael', 'fascinating', 'concept', 'opinion', 'shame', 'touch', 'film', 'tease', 'previous', 'change', 'fact', 'michael', 'myers', 'finally', 'haddonfield', 'scream', 'blood', 'laurie', 'act', 'like', 'total', 'badass', 'ask', 'thing', 'film', 'conclusion', 'original', 'halloween', 'franchise', 'halloween', 'ii', 'h20', 'timeline', 'laurie', 'finally', 'bloodthirsty', 'psychotic', 'brother', 'avenge', 'innocent', 'life', 'include', 'close', 'dear', 'laurie', 'truly', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'opinion']"

Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a big dream >_<
I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM* I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 31k comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!). 

*FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen. ""Markiplier's Let's Play Slender The Arrival!"" I was so excited because I LOVED Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. (Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!). 

As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos WHENEVER I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. (SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!) 

So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. TakeTheJurny, because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice. No one has to sub I just wanted everyone to have a chance to see my Youtube before it hits 1million, and that will happen one day :) thanks for reading, and as always I will see you, when I heed the call, to the next Journey, Adios guys! <3 and thanks so much for reading!","['hey', 'hi', 'takethejurny', 'fellow', 'small', 'youtuber', 'big', 'dream', 'explain', 'mean', 'time', 'read', 'comment', 'know', 'probably', 'ready', 'different', 'video', 'maybe', 'look', 'phone', 'mean', 'lot', 'society', 'time', 'precious', 'thank', 'reading', 'attention', 'm', 'mhm', 'work', 'hard', 'youtube', 'fear', 'new', 'rule', 'regulation', 'terrible', 'adpocalypse', 'hard', 'surpass', 'classic', 'viral', 'video', 'decide', 'comment', 'viral', 'video', 'yes', 'advertising', 'hear', 'right', '31k', 'comment', 'video', 'single', 'person', 'comment', 'video', 'comment', 'look', 'channel', 'subscribe', 'literally', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'mean', 'think', 'second', 'work', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'ask', 'subscribe', 'want', 'people', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'work', 'sub', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'try', 'find', 'fast', 'easy', 'way', 'chance', 'work', 'enjoy', 'chance', 'grow', 'youtuber', 'let', 'rephrase', 'dream', 'truly', 'understand', 'goal', '...', '(also', 'thank', 'read', 'flashback', 'narration', 'scene', 'little', 'kid', 'rough', 'childhood', 'father', 'hurt', 'mom', '13', 'crappy', 'year', 'crazy', 'right', 'finally', 'shake', 'mom', 'leave', 'love', 'dad', 'stay', 'totally', 'suck', 'constantly', 'hurt', 'want', 'detailed', 'kid', 'reading--', 'anyways', 'plus', 'outcasted', 'classmate', 'school', 'pretty', 'stuck', 'watch', 'netflix', 'eat', 'fun', 'time', 'hard', 'bright', 'thing', 'lose', 'hope', 'sink', 'deep', 'sort', 'young', 'depression', 'find', '..', 'watch', 'youtube', 'time', 'think', 'kind', 'bore', 'tbh', 'cry', 'day', 'look', 'enjoyment', 'screen', 'markiplier', 'let', 'play', 'slender', 'arrival', 'excited', 'love', 'slenderman', 'mind', 'click', 'know', 'happen', '...', 'happen', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'hey', 'thumb', 'read', 'know', 'lot', 'sorry', 'watch', 'markiplier', 'listen', 'positive', 'glow', 'bright', 'booming', 'smile', 'squeal', 'different', 'thing', 'game', 'notice', 'start', 'change', 'stop', 'cry', 'smile', 'focused', 'laugh', 'video', 'watch', 'video', 'sad', 'unhappy', 'video', 'fail', 'lift', 'cleanse', 'darkness', 'wander', 'dark', 'corner', 'bravely', 'wander', 'like', 'family', 'want', 'share', 'feeling', 'happiness', 'feeling', 'peace', 'chaos', 'want', 'like', 'happy', 'positive', 'sort', 'universal', 'truth', 'peace', 'wonderful', 'family', 'want', 'want', 'smile', 'laugh', 'bad', 'day', 'family', 'sorry', ""i'll"", 'hurry', 'dang', 'read', 'wow', 'dream', 'markiplier', 'light', 'person', 'darkness', 'want', 'laugh', 'bring', 'youtube', 'takethejurny', 'life', 'journey', 'want', 'spam', 'choice', 'sub', 'want', 'chance', 'youtube', 'hit', '1million', 'happen', 'day', ':)', 'thank', 'reading', 'heed', 'journey', 'adios', 'guy', '<3', 'thank', 'read']"

But the reason for doing so is so that they can only add to what makes Michael Myers scarier than Freddy or Jason ever had time to be - how LITTLE we know about him.  The less we know about him, the more terrifying he is.  Michael and Laurie aren't even brother and sister anymore.  And I kind of like that - because their reason for doing so is exactly what I've been saying;  It gave Michael a clear motive and made him less scary.  Without it, he's back to being the unpredictable escaped lunatic from Halloween.

So all you're left with is a normal happy little boy who one Halloween night, picked up a knife, gutted his own sister, and desired only to keep killing.

What made him scary was that you could never get a clear look, and there was always a sense of suspense generated by the fact that he was everywhere, almost playing a scary game of peekaboo with his victims. The costume design is on point, I will give the crew that. But I am already very concerned, given that the trailer relies on showing Michael Myers in focus rather than out of focus and relies on cheap gross-out and horror gags (like Michael in the closet).

I tell you, Nay:
but, except ye repent,
ye shall all likewise perish.
(Luke 13:3).

I tell you, Nay:
but, except ye repent,
ye shall all likewise perish.
(Luke 13:5).

***(Unless you repent): Jesus point here is that everyone stands at the edge of death until repentance occurs. The death in view here is spiritual, not physical).
***(The manner in which a person dies is not a measure of righteousness; what is important is not to die outside of God's grace and care. The way to avoid such a fate is to repent, to come to God through the care of the physician Jesus. (John 5:32)<--I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance).
***(Repent/Repentance): The Hebrew word translated repent means, ‚ÄúTurn Back‚Äù or ‚ÄúTurn around‚Äù. The word refers to a reversal or change of direction. The Prophets commonly used this word to call Israelites to a radically conscious rejection of their past Sin. When used as a theological term, repentance implies not only sorrow but a complete turnaround: To change one‚Äôs mind about Sin, receive God‚Äôs provision of Salvation, and return whole heartedly to him).

He spake also this parable;
A certain man had a fig tree 
planted in his vineyard; 
and he came and sought fruit thereon, 
and found none.

***(A fig tree): Often represents God's blessing, or a people who have a special relationship with God. The man in this parable represents God; the fig tree represents Israel).
Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard,

Behold,

these three years I come seeking fruit 
on this fig tree, 
and find none: 
cut it down; 
why does it use up the ground?

And he answering said unto him,

Lord, 
let it alone this year also, 
till I shall dig around it, 
and fertilize it:

And if it bear fruit, 
well:
but if not,

then after that 
thou shalt cut it down.

***(But if not): If the tree, symbolizing Israel, would yield some fruit it could escape judgment; a failure to be fruitful would result in judgment).

(Luke 13:6-9).

***(John 15:5-10)<---(Jesus)<---I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: (continue ye in my love). If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

***(Matthew 3:10<---(Jesus)<---And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

***(Matthew 7:19)<---(Jesus)<---Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

***(Matthew 3:8)<---(Jesus)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

ek1ePFp-nBI,It seems that a lot of people are really confused and I don‚Äôt know why because it is super simple. The only canon movie to this movie is the first Halloween by John Carpenter. Halloween 2 takes place on the same night but it‚Äôs not canon. This is said in the trailer since it is mentioned that Laurie is not his sister and also that he only killed 3 people and that‚Äôs it. The only thing that is confusing is how he was arrested right after the first movie since he was shot 6 times by Dr. Loomis and then his body disappeared meaning he escaped. Supposedly they are ignoring the continuity that says that he is immortal so him disappearing after being shot that many times makes no sense. Oh and I‚Äôm actually kind of happy that they are ignoring the second movie and Laurie being his sister because that gets rid of the ridiculous coincidence that is their connection. Now it‚Äôs just some random psychotic killer which is actually better for the story because it really makes him the boogeyman.,"['lot', 'people', 'confused', 'know', 'super', 'simple', 'canon', 'movie', 'movie', 'halloween', 'john', 'carpenter', 'halloween', '2', 'place', 'night', '‚Äô', 'canon', 'trailer', 'mention', 'laurie', 'sister', 'kill', '3', 'people', '‚Äô', 'thing', 'confusing', 'arrest', 'right', 'movie', 'shoot', '6', 'time', 'dr.', 'loomis', 'body', 'disappear', 'mean', 'escape', 'supposedly', 'ignore', 'continuity', 'immortal', 'disappear', 'shoot', 'time', 'sense', 'oh', 'actually', 'kind', 'happy', 'ignore', 'second', 'movie', 'laurie', 'sister', 'rid', 'ridiculous', 'coincidence', 'connection', '‚Äô', 'random', 'psychotic', 'killer', 'actually', 'story', 'boogeyman']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,Sadly this looks very poor and generic to me. I was four years old when Halloween 1978 was released and started my love of Horror movies. When I look at this trailer the atmosphere is so out to place. I mean come on....a S Carolina shoot is a poor go and does nothing for the feel of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis may be in this one but the way she is presenting is questionable and I think the story line is choppy and full of holes that will only disappoint the fans in the end. Blumhouse has yet to impress me with any of their films and this one seems to be no different. Maybe I am the only one as most comments I am reading seem to be happy and that is Okay. I am much older now and maybe expectations run different among younger audiences. I guess this is the Halloween catered to a new generation. I do hope the movie well and I still plan to see it but not expecting much. I will only be out of $20 and 2 hours of my time and if it exceeds my expectations then I will be pleasantly surprised. Hopefully another upcoming director will come forward and do it justice eventually as an old fan like me hopes to see but until then we shall await October.

So, to me having Laurie Strode face down Michael who as it turns out ISN'T her brother is great. I know many a fan are pissed that this ignores everything after part one, however, I fully understand why the decision was made to have it be so. 

The sibling connection along with the whole bloody curse of thorn bit got old fast. And while I did enjoy parts 2, 3, and 4, it all went exponentially downhill after 4. And Rob Zombie's shitty remake and sequel only added salt to the wound. This looks as though they're taking things back to basics as it were with suspense, relying less on gore and shock, and giving it the same vibe as the original. I love the fact that Laurie has known in her heart for years that he'd come back, and she's been ready. 

Plus she has family of her own to protect from him, and that makes it even more interesting. I really hope this is the end of the franchise, and they choose not to milk it any further.

I think that's not the case at all.  I think Michael is just on the mindset of ""kill,"" and the only reason he happens to run into Laurie again is because SHE is chasing him.  Once she finds him again he might re-target her, but if she didn't chase him down I don't think he would've necessarily gone straight for her.  Remember, the way he was originally crafted by John Carpenter was that he had no sentiment.  He had no true thought processes of his own, unless they were to stalk & kill.  Once he has escaped, he can only do so, no more, no less.  He's an extremely simple being, which arguably makes him scarier, and the story of the original sequels seemed to forget that.","['comment', 'brother', 'sister', 'connection', 'toss', 'sense', 'michael', 'incentive', 'laurie', 'think', 'case', 'think', 'michael', 'mindset', 'kill', 'reason', 'happen', 'run', 'laurie', 'chase', 'find', 'target', 'chase', 'think', 'necessarily', 'straight', 'remember', 'way', 'originally', 'craft', 'john', 'carpenter', 'sentiment', 'true', 'thought', 'process', 'stalk', 'kill', 'escape', 'extremely', 'simple', 'arguably', 'scary', 'story', 'original', 'sequel', 'forget']"

If Michael was captured after Loomis shot him, that kills the ending of the original movie. Unless he just gets caught down the street or something, but that would be even worse. 

Michael being 61 years old also bugs me. How can he possibly be Michael Myers at that age? I'm sure it won't harm the movie, but I wish he wasn't a senior citizen. 

Another issue is that the last time Laurie Strode was put back into the spotlight we got H20 which was a bad movie. Its praise is mind-boggling. Hopefully this time she takes a lesser role. I don't mind her being there but I don't want the finale to be the clash of old people.

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I find some of the comments to the trailer so utterly frustrating, and so completely lacking in understanding of PTSD.  Laurie Strode, 40 years ago was stalked by an escaped mental patient.  Michael Myers killed 2 of her best friends, Annie and Lynda, along with Lynda's boyfriend Bob, then staged their bodies for Laurie to find, like some kind of haunted house.  He then attacked her and injured her.  She then had to defend the two children in her care, while also trying to defend herself.  After stabbing him with a knitting needle, coat hanger, and his own butcher knife, she finally gets the kids to safety and is only saved herself by Michael's own therapist, who shoots him 6 times, causing him to fall of a second floor balcony, and even then he survives and walks away, and we now know was caught and put back in lock-down, the very type of environment he escaped from once before.  

Laurie Strode lost not only two close friends, but from what we saw in the first film, they were the yin to her yang, they were outgoing and adventurous, while she was shy and apprehensive.  They were the type of friends who push you to do things you otherwise likely wouldn't do on your own.  Laurie through this loss, likely became isolated, and lived many years after the first film in fear.  People have different ways of coping with the fear of PTSD, one of which is to become fixated on the cause, and to take steps to, in the case of PTSD caused by being a victim of some event in the past, go out of their way to prepare to ensure what happened before can't happen again.  Laurie was meek, easily scared, and defenseless in the first film, a person who obsesses on ensuring what happened in the past can't happen again would become exactly what Laurie has become.

Could she have chosen to leave Haddonfield, maybe, we don't know the circumstances of her financial means, and other various things that would have dictated such actions.  Also to consider, her remaining friends and family, most of them anyways, still live in the area.  We don't know what she's been through.  All we know, is that some point, fear turned to anger, and that anger turned to obsession with preparing for what she believed was inevitable.  Regardless of whether she stayed by choice, or more out of obligation, or if maybe she did leave for a time, but chose or was obligated to come back, she chose to face her fears head on, instead of being consumed and paralyzed by them.  She chose to prepare for what she believed would inevitably happen, that he would return.

She chose, whether fortunate or unfortunate for her, wisely.","['find', 'comment', 'trailer', 'utterly', 'frustrating', 'completely', 'lack', 'understanding', 'ptsd', 'laurie', 'strode', '40', 'year', 'ago', 'stalk', 'escape', 'mental', 'patient', 'michael', 'myers', 'kill', '2', 'good', 'friend', 'annie', 'lynda', 'lynda', 'boyfriend', 'bob', 'stage', 'body', 'laurie', 'find', 'like', 'kind', 'haunted', 'house', 'attack', 'injure', 'defend', 'child', 'care', 'try', 'defend', 'stab', 'knit', 'needle', 'coat', 'hanger', 'butcher', 'knife', 'finally', 'kid', 'safety', 'save', 'michael', 'therapist', 'shoot', '6', 'time', 'cause', 'fall', 'second', 'floor', 'balcony', 'survive', 'walk', 'away', 'know', 'catch', 'lock', 'type', 'environment', 'escape', 'laurie', 'strode', 'lose', 'close', 'friend', 'film', 'yin', 'yang', 'outgoing', 'adventurous', 'shy', 'apprehensive', 'type', 'friend', 'push', 'thing', 'likely', 'laurie', 'loss', 'likely', 'isolated', 'live', 'year', 'film', 'fear', 'people', 'different', 'way', 'cope', 'fear', 'ptsd', 'fixate', 'cause', 'step', 'case', 'ptsd', 'cause', 'victim', 'event', 'past', 'way', 'prepare', 'ensure', 'happen', 'happen', 'laurie', 'meek', 'easily', 'scared', 'defenseless', 'film', 'person', 'obsess', 'ensure', 'happen', 'past', 'happen', 'exactly', 'laurie', 'choose', 'leave', 'haddonfield', 'maybe', 'know', 'circumstance', 'financial', 'mean', 'thing', 'dictate', 'action', 'consider', 'remain', 'friend', 'family', 'anyways', 'live', 'area', 'know', 'know', 'point', 'fear', 'turn', 'anger', 'anger', 'turn', 'obsession', 'prepare', 'believe', 'inevitable', 'regardless', 'stay', 'choice', 'obligation', 'maybe', 'leave', 'time', 'choose', 'obligate', 'come', 'choose', 'face', 'fear', 'head', 'instead', 'consume', 'paralyze', 'choose', 'prepare', 'believe', 'inevitably', 'happen', 'return', 'choose', 'fortunate', 'unfortunate', 'wisely']"

So for this to work in the movie they either payed some lower ranking people to get to see him or that entire part of the story is royally screwed up and doesn't make any sense.","['issue', 'documentary', 'team', 'come', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'actual', 'sanatorium', 'allow', 'random', 'people', 'visit', 'serial', 'killer', 'bring', 'relic', 'murderous', 'past', 'doctor', 'allow', 'run', 'huge', 'risk', 'set', 'patient', 'like', 'literally', 'movie', 'work', 'movie', 'pay', 'lower', 'rank', 'people', 'entire', 'story', 'royally', 'screw', 'sense']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,"I understand the choice to have it a sequel to the first and not have Michael be related BUT I struggle a bit to find Laurie's motivation to be prepared for his return. Really in the first film she barely has interaction with Michael, summed up to be about 30 mins being persued by a man in a Mask only to be shot and disappear. If its been 40 years I don't know how committed she would have been to this cause and be ready for an unknown stranger that attacked her on Halloween Night

At the very least, if they kept the relationship cannon, she'd know that Michael is always thinking of his sister, that there may be a chance he'll come for her, that drove her motivation in H2O always knowing he could be there and always having to look over her shoulder, that gave H2O its charm, the eerie notion that my brother is going to come for me, to remove that and it be just a stranger...hmmm I struggle a bit I have to admit.

Then I thought well if it was a sequel to Halloween 2, atleast Michael's determination would have been there to keep coming for his sister, the only work around to that would be the burning of Michael's body at the end but really they could have retreaded Halloween 4's beginning with him being transported.

I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what they''re going to do with this one, again Laurie's obsession for preparing for Michael at least from the trailer end of it seems a bit of a stretch, the audience knows what the characters have been through in the 7 movies or so BUT this is a woman readying herself not really so that she's never scared and attacked by someone again but specifically for one man that tried to kill her one time when she was a teenager, kinda wish for that reason this was a sequel to H2O and not to just the first film, then we would have established Laurie's drive and what lengths she'll go through","['understand', 'choice', 'sequel', 'michael', 'relate', 'struggle', 'bit', 'find', 'laurie', 'motivation', 'prepare', 'return', 'film', 'barely', 'interaction', 'michael', 'sum', '30', 'min', 'persue', 'man', 'mask', 'shoot', 'disappear', '40', 'year', 'know', 'committed', 'cause', 'ready', 'unknown', 'stranger', 'attack', 'halloween', 'night', 'relationship', 'cannon', 'know', 'michael', 'think', 'sister', 'chance', 'come', 'drive', 'motivation', 'h2o', 'know', 'look', 'shoulder', 'h2o', 'charm', 'eerie', 'notion', 'brother', 'come', 'remove', 'stranger', '...', 'hmmm', 'struggle', 'bit', 'admit', 'think', 'sequel', 'halloween', '2', 'atleast', 'michael', 'determination', 'come', 'sister', 'work', 'burning', 'michael', 'body', 'end', 'retread', 'halloween', '4', 'beginning', 'transport', 'definitely', 'look', 'forward', ""they''re"", 'laurie', 'obsession', 'prepare', 'michael', 'trailer', 'end', 'bit', 'stretch', 'audience', 'know', 'character', '7', 'movie', 'woman', 'ready', 'scare', 'attack', 'specifically', 'man', 'try', 'kill', 'time', 'teenager', 'kinda', 'wish', 'reason', 'sequel', 'h2o', 'film', 'establish', 'laurie', 'drive', 'length']"

ek1ePFp-nBI,#Actualfanswhowokeupat7amtowatchthisbefore1millionviewstoshowofinthiscomment,
ek1ePFp-nBI,"Let's clear this up:  Danny McBride chose not to include the second film because it established Laurie as his sister.  It was only decided to make Laurie his sister after the success of the original movie.  The decision to make her his sister was made because 1.) they didn't want the ""babysitter killer"" story to get old and 2.) Jamie Lee Curtis made her character Laurie so compelling that they needed an excuse to bring her back for the sequel...  

For the 2018 movie, Danny McBride chose to exclude the sibling relationship because he felt it made Michael less terrifying.  If his primary motivation for killing is just to kill his sister, it gives the audience a sense of security, knowing they will be safe as long as they stay away from his relatives.  I was disappointed by this because I love the journey Laurie's character takes in the original franchise, going from a real victim suffering from PTSD to a strong survivor who faced her fears (minus the god awful Halloween Resurrection).  But then after watching the 2018 trailer, I instantly looked over my shoulder in paranoia, so Danny's choice worked...  

Another disappointment of mine is disregarding all of the other films.  Don't get me wrong:  With the exception of Halloween 1, 2, and H20, the rest are pretty shitty (in my opinion).  But I HATE discontinuity.  I'd rather work hard to clean up and wrap up a declining franchise than just ""reboot"" it.  A reboot-sequel (I know this movie is NOT a full reboot) like this usually satisfies dedicated fans, but confuses new viewers who aren't familiar.

My only lasting disappointment is the removal of the supernatural element. And I'm not talking about the dumb backstory that Michael has to kill his family as some sacrifice.  I'm talking about Carpenter's original description of Michael as ""The Shape;"" this raw insatiable shark-like evil that will stop at nothing to kill her.  A darkness that can't be reasoned with.  I don't want him to be invincible, but someone stronger than the strongest man and more animalistic than any animal.  While I only like Halloweens 1, 2, and H20, I do like how the evil essence of Michael is an unkillable energy that can be passed on after his death (like to his niece Jamie in Halloween 4).  Sadly, serial killers are a dime a dozen, so they'll have to work hard to separate Michael Myers from the rest.","['let', 'clear', 'danny', 'mcbride', 'choose', 'include', 'second', 'film', 'establish', 'laurie', 'sister', 'decide', 'laurie', 'sister', 'success', 'original', 'movie', 'decision', 'sister', '1', 'want', 'babysitter', 'killer', 'story', 'old', '2', 'jamie', 'lee', 'curtis', 'character', 'laurie', 'compelling', 'need', 'excuse', 'bring', 'sequel', '...', '2018', 'movie', 'danny', 'mcbride', 'choose', 'exclude', 'sibling', 'relationship', 'feel', 'michael', 'terrifying', 'primary', 'motivation', 'killing', 'kill', 'sister', 'audience', 'sense', 'security', 'know', 'safe', 'long', 'stay', 'away', 'relative', 'disappoint', 'love', 'journey', 'laurie', 'character', 'original', 'franchise', 'real', 'victim', 'suffer', 'ptsd', 'strong', 'survivor', 'face', 'fear', 'minus', 'god', 'awful', 'halloween', 'resurrection', 'watch', '2018', 'trailer', 'instantly', 'look', 'shoulder', 'paranoia', 'danny', 'choice', 'work', '...', 'disappointment', 'disregard', 'film', 'wrong', 'exception', 'halloween', '1', '2', 'h20', 'rest', 'pretty', 'shitty', 'opinion', 'hate', 'discontinuity', 'work', 'hard', 'clean', 'wrap', 'decline', 'franchise', 'reboot', 'reboot', 'sequel', 'know', 'movie', 'reboot', 'like', 'usually', 'satisfy', 'dedicate', 'fan', 'confuse', 'new', 'viewer', 'familiar', 'disappointment', 'removal', 'supernatural', 'element', 'talk', 'dumb', 'backstory', 'michael', 'kill', 'family', 'sacrifice', 'talk', 'carpenter', 'original', 'description', 'michael', 'shape', 'raw', 'insatiable', 'shark', 'like', 'evil', 'stop', 'kill', 'darkness', 'reason', 'want', 'invincible', 'strong', 'strong', 'man', 'animalistic', 'animal', 'like', 'halloweens', '1', '2', 'h20', 'like', 'evil', 'essence', 'michael', 'unkillable', 'energy', 'pass', 'death', 'like', 'niece', 'jamie', 'halloween', '4', 'sadly', 'serial', 'killer', 'dime', 'dozen', 'work', 'hard', 'separate', 'michael', 'myers', 'rest']"

This Halloween is the sequel to the original Halloween by John Carpenter, taking place 40 years after the original film in which Michael Myers was apprehended presumably after he ran off after he was shot by Loomis. This film retcons every single sequel following that ending which means Laurie Strode and Michael Myers are no longer siblings. 

Also for those thinking this film will receive sequels, you're dead wrong. Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter are intending this to be the last showdown between Laurie and Michael and finally give a definitive ending to the Halloween franchise, that's the only reason they wanted to make this film. So take it all in because this trailer, this event is a once in a lifetime opportunity to go witness one of horror's greatest icons on the big screen.

I will never forget that there were people leaving their seats and heading towards the back of the theater and then standing there to continue watching it.  They were so scared.

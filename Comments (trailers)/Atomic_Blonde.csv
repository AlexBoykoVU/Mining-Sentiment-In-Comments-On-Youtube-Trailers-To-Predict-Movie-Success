aieQrj9Yy8s,Terrible movie ending. Very anti climactic and easily predictable plot. Overall meh 4/10
aieQrj9Yy8s,DIDN'T LIKE IT
aieQrj9Yy8s,Is this the trailer that won the award for the most original trailer?
aieQrj9Yy8s,bad fight choreo
aieQrj9Yy8s,Feminists and lesbians killing kgb agents. Is this a sci-fi movie?
aieQrj9Yy8s,I will surely lick her steely buns
aieQrj9Yy8s,i found that movie in hd on videostream.tv :)
aieQrj9Yy8s,I am going to get you too Thor!!!!!!!!!!!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Bissexual protagonist , this agenda sucks."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"David: I think I love you 
Lorraine: Thats to bad"
aieQrj9Yy8s,I will never lower my standards to pay to see these fighting scenes.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"how to have a list of a class actors and pull of a poor film ? How's that possible james Mcavoy, charlize the list goes on .. just dissapointed thought this would be good..keanu smashed It on his own pretty much in 2 prior films too Jane wick"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Pure crap, probably feminist."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Seems this movie was sponsored by cigarette manufacturers, seems many actors are very heavy smokers. Smoking cigarettes accelerates aging and increases the risk of cancer. Very bad  example to imitate, especially for young generations.  Bleah."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Plot twist, she is John Wick's mother"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"John Wick, Agent Salt, Bourne, James Bond BS kind of movie. Hollywood is really running low on ideas. It's either Amityville part 20, or Incidious part 6, Anabelle part 5 or a super heroe/ comic book movie , a remake of an 80's - 90's movie.  Yes you can copy but change it a little bit so the teacher won't notice. That's why i DL the shit out of these movies not worth spending my money."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Shit, those fight scenes look amazing. Might have to watch this one."
aieQrj9Yy8s,You can literally see the stunt men waiting to get hit at 0:58 and 1:36
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I'll tell ya'll why people are triggered. Because women are biologically and physiologically weaker than women. Weaker skulls and bone structure. Also, less muscle density blah blah blah. Therefore that blow at 0:53 combined with hitting her head against the concrete would have killed her. Game over. Also, I dont see how one of these guys didnt think to just pick her up and throw her. Also, side note...What the hell is that punch at 0:58 saying? Laughable. One guy would demolish her. Please stop hollywood. Its more unrealistic than John Wick. And thats saying something. I actually liked her character in Mad Max. This doesn't work. Just reminds me Im watching more pc hollwood bs. I wont even waste my time to pirate this."
aieQrj9Yy8s,so only men has to work out for there parts now? she looks like she cant even lift a bicycle...
aieQrj9Yy8s,Travel no further down this rabbit hole of you see this comment. Only pussies below.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Who let that bitch out of the kitchen?
aieQrj9Yy8s,I thought they was finna play young pappy Killa üòÇüòÇüòÇüëåüèΩ
aieQrj9Yy8s,Trailers are viewers worst enemies.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"The movie is silly because the woman is trying to be a man. Women can best men in other ways, this movie lacks creativity. Just like most action movies."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Lol women can't beat men in a fight. Unrealistic as fuck. Women are not physically as strong and as fast as men.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Just seen it, one word... AWESOME !!! üëç"
aieQrj9Yy8s,Dope movie. Saw it twice!
aieQrj9Yy8s,The ending is very... well... twisted
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I finnaly watched the movie. I enjoyed it. The topic is absorbing. And the fight scenes, well, I'm fascinated by them. Especially that stairwell scene. There is a good point about this movie that ""They didn't overdose the violence. And neither kept it too low."" Just brilliant. I highly recommend you to watch this one. Have fun."
aieQrj9Yy8s,This looks sick I want to see this.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"This movie is the result of cynical hollywood marketing executives who wanted to make an easy cash grab. Then they sell it as the female 007 even though Salt, Mr.& Ms.Smith, Hanna, and Kill Bill exist. So congrats to anyone who thinks this movie is something original or amazing, because all you are is a mindless pawn in a marketing campaign. They even stole the title from a band, need I say more?"

aieQrj9Yy8s,*stares at computer screen* OH FUCK YEAH!!!
aieQrj9Yy8s,Terrible actress and I can not suspend disbelief long enough to even entertain watching her.
aieQrj9Yy8s,The only reason I'm here is because of Queen's Killer Queen <3
aieQrj9Yy8s,"saw the movie, was great"
aieQrj9Yy8s,John Wick's sister..
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Why are men usually the bad guys, like in all action movies when a guy is the main hero you never see him going around punching and killing women :D why can't they make a movie where a woman is beating up other women xD like is this supposed to send us the message that woman are equally strong as men?"

aieQrj9Yy8s,"I just came out of the movie. And despite all the criticism ect. I actually really liked it. It was so refreshing to see a main character showing weakness in the fights. It somehow made everything seem so much more realistic, like Lorraine was not perfect but badass none the less. 
And Charlize! She was sooo good in the movie!!!!"
aieQrj9Yy8s,OMG the music !!! It's Queen üò±üòç
aieQrj9Yy8s,Holy shit... just wow. I think I like girls now. üò∂
aieQrj9Yy8s,I just watched this movie yesterday in the theater!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Just because the movie has a female protagonist doesn't mean it's a ""feminist movie"". The movie having a female protagonist doesn't mean it's bad. So many people are saying that this is the same as every other action movie but with a woman as a protagonist which somehow makes it unrealistic. Wake up, most action movies these days are basically the same. Making a woman the protagonist is pretty refreshing,  I'd say. I do think having to constantly watch invincible muscle men saving women who can't do anything themselves gets pretty boring."
aieQrj9Yy8s,I'm not straight I like boys and girls and I'm 11 years old!
aieQrj9Yy8s,I just saw the movie and it's way better than the trailers make it out to be!! great plot and action scenes!
aieQrj9Yy8s,NO RECOMIENDO VER ESTA PELI ES MUYY MALA
aieQrj9Yy8s,Stunts are slow I had to play at 2.0x
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Just saw this. Not that great, kinda ehh. fight scenes ok. Saw John wick comments. This has Nothing on John wick."
aieQrj9Yy8s,This movie was excellent to me.. She was sexy
aieQrj9Yy8s,This will be on Net Flix by September LOL
aieQrj9Yy8s,This movie was friggin' badass. I got exactly what I expected: Charlize Theron kicking everyone's teeth in for two hours.
aieQrj9Yy8s,She is trying  to  be Angelina. ...
aieQrj9Yy8s,Im so in love with Charlize <3
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Cool idea, but I'd have picked a different actor. She doesn't really look like she knows what she's doing. :\"
aieQrj9Yy8s,Love how real the fight scenes look.
aieQrj9Yy8s,I don't see her using a pencil to kill people
aieQrj9Yy8s,TMI
aieQrj9Yy8s,When the clip started I thought I was looking at Hot Lips from MASH.  :)
aieQrj9Yy8s,Literally a wasted opporfuckingtunity... The song is NAMED Atomic! It's fucking BY a band named Blondie! You couldn't fucking throw it in movie?!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"In the beginning or in the credits it should say ""feminists had to do with the making of this film"". Ps this film looks like shit."
aieQrj9Yy8s,My favourite Queen song!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"tbh the only thing i want to know is

which queen song is playing in the background please i need it"
aieQrj9Yy8s,So this is Harley Quinn after Suicide Squad..
aieQrj9Yy8s,Can't wait for this to come out so i can stop seeing commercials of it.
aieQrj9Yy8s,I wonder if the writer was influenced by Atomic by Blondie.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Im seeing Atomic Blond 7/28/2017 this Friday!  3 more days...
aieQrj9Yy8s,Would make sense if she just used guns
aieQrj9Yy8s,A woman her size would get thrown around like a ragdoll by those husky motherfuckers in real life.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Imagine if Kill Bill was released nowdays...
aieQrj9Yy8s,"To all the guys in the comment section who find a woman able to fight the most unbelievable thing they've ever seen in a movie... I have to question your actual fight experience. If you'd spent a little more time in a dojo, you'd probably have learned that while men clearly have the advantage, a skilled woman can easily come out on top in a combat situation. I knew a 16 year old girl in our BBJ studio who was the best student in the under 18 group. A Krav Maga student I knew hospitalized two men who tried to rape her. There's nothing fantastical about the premise."
aieQrj9Yy8s,no thanks. already watched john wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Stop looking at what's between a person legs, we all fucking human. If the movie is good, and it's not fucking 3rd. wave feminist propaganda, I'm ok with it."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Okay I know it is a movie but it looks like it is not set in a world where Wonder Woman exists and I like a woman who can kick my ass but this is just silly. Thought producers would have learned from the new ""ghost busters"" But if you want your movie to bomb go for it! hahaha"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"She has no motive, no goal. This is why john wick is better."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Nice, Jason Bourne"
aieQrj9Yy8s,this movie is going to be awful  because it's not john wick and they should have chosen someone less known or at least a tougher looking hottie
aieQrj9Yy8s,I need to do that elbow trick
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I saw this last night at a pre-screening. It's amazing, the cinematography, soundtrack and casting are perfect"
aieQrj9Yy8s,I think I fucking love you. Hah!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I don't understand why one of the guys don't just bear hug her to the ground, movie over"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Is this a Trump rally going on here or what? Go away you dumb asses, you never go to cinema or holidays. Stay in your cages."
aieQrj9Yy8s,All this is is a ripe off of Salt. Same plot and fight scenes just staged different. Please and Angie had the title of female James Bond way before.
aieQrj9Yy8s,yea Sam Hargrave!! STUNTS
aieQrj9Yy8s,seems like shed kick john wicks ass to me
aieQrj9Yy8s,What's the songs name at the start where she tapes the thing on her stomach
aieQrj9Yy8s,dear admin plz upload this movie in Hindi audio also when this movie release
aieQrj9Yy8s,"This movie is being billed as the first female 007. Actually, that honor belongs to Modesty Blaise."
aieQrj9Yy8s,no one is going to talk about that probably 20% of people who's going to watch this is because of the sex scene? just me?
aieQrj9Yy8s,those guys are stupid they cant stop her leave that to me I will definitely not fail. I have work to do
aieQrj9Yy8s,Jessica Wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,"All i seem to do nowadays is search for similar looking women on porn sites thanks to this film Atomic Blonde, what an absolute disgrace."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"The actions scenes are enough to make me want to watch it, and those 'females action' scenes just give me the urge to watch it"
aieQrj9Yy8s,CORNY!!!!
aieQrj9Yy8s,Can't wait
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Everyone is dissing the movie saying its like John Wick and the fights scenes suck. Im over here like I HAVEN'T SEEN A GOOD GIRL PROTAGONIST SINCE ""Lucy"". I still have some hope for the movie and if she's anything like John Wick then the movie is definitely gonna be good."
aieQrj9Yy8s,This is going to be one of the most stupidest movies I've seen
aieQrj9Yy8s,"This isn't a gripe against this movie in particular, but why is it that so many people in movies can't fucking swear right?  Like when she says ""fuck"" or when that limey says ""bollocks"" it's like...  Can you please TRY to sell it?  Remember great things like Boondock Saints where EVERYBODY knew how to swear and make it sound like they actually talk like that?  I see this as a rising trend.  It's almost like they're talking and then take a breath to say one bad word.  FUCKING MAKE IT SOUND FUCKING NATURAL YOU DAMN SHITHEAD PROFESSIONALS."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"This. Looks. Infuckingcredible.

Mcavoy alone makes me want to see this..."
aieQrj9Yy8s,I wanna see this movie
aieQrj9Yy8s,I doubt this is going to be better than the rest of these shitty movies. All the movies nowadays are fucking garbage.
aieQrj9Yy8s,John Wick's mom?Or older sister?
aieQrj9Yy8s,can someone tell me the remix of this song blue monday -  health????
aieQrj9Yy8s,"God dammit at least give Charlize some formal combat training before the filming. That's some pretty fucking bad combat. If Keanu Reaves can manage hundreds of hours of firearms training for a movie then you can fucking manage a crash course. 

I'll still watch it for the lesbian scene though, lez be honest."
aieQrj9Yy8s,I Hate that for Atomic Blonde they keep on calling her the female 007 like why can't you just let her be her own superspy she doesn't need a male counterpart.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Damn I need a wife like this
aieQrj9Yy8s,Female John Wick my ass. Where in John Wick was Keanu Reeves fucking a hot guy he met in a bar??
aieQrj9Yy8s,"count me out as a viewer, I am not into lesbians."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"ALIENS had Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. She was a female ass kicker that everyone could admire. This is just trash. It's just violence for the sake of it. Hollywood has sunk to it's lowest now. First, torture porn inspired by Eli Roth's garbage-fests. And now, this feminist bullshit. Wonder Woman also did the strong female protagonist the right way. But, sadly, the Wonder Woman film is a shining jewel floating at the top of the steaming cesspool that Hollywood has become."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Jane Wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,2:20 Nice..
aieQrj9Yy8s,this feels like a john wick rip off
aieQrj9Yy8s,i friigginngg love him too
aieQrj9Yy8s,*Heres Killer Queen* HEY IS THAT THERE A MOTHER FUCKING *JOJO REFERENCE*?
aieQrj9Yy8s,real bad ass movie
aieQrj9Yy8s,"She reminds me Evelyn Salt.
Who else thinks Angelina Jolie would have killed this role?"
aieQrj9Yy8s,im only here to see james...
aieQrj9Yy8s,I see angelina jolie doing such film..
aieQrj9Yy8s,"What did she say when the man who help her said ""i think i fucking love you"" what's her answer to that? Please anyone?"
aieQrj9Yy8s,I'm cringing. Had to turn it off to make the pain of a watching more than 10 seconds of this shit go away.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"gotta admit, looks good! But I'll rather see Hardcore Henry"
aieQrj9Yy8s,I find a woman-lead in a male role funny
aieQrj9Yy8s,"wow such feminism much empowerment. 
honestly it doesn't really matter all movies nowadays suck and are repulsive."
aieQrj9Yy8s,hmmm looks like Kill Bill and Jason Bourne had a baby... Now shut up and take my money...
aieQrj9Yy8s,?
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I'm such a nerd, at the beginning I just think Far Dareis Mai."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Damn! Hot lesbian action! Fuck yeah!
aieQrj9Yy8s,Same old shit I'll pass!
aieQrj9Yy8s,Theres only going to be one scene that Ill be watching this movie for
aieQrj9Yy8s,"What's interesting is, if radical feminists weren't pushing their ""agenda"" (whatever that actually is!) so hard, nobody would bat an eyelash at the premise/fight.  It's like they don't realize they provoke the very behavior they claim to want banished."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Clearly fiction, lol."
aieQrj9Yy8s,You should never ever hit a girl. Especially when they can kick the ever loving shit out of you.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Yeah NO !!!!!! A female Jason Bourne, another Aeon Flux movie? Nothing new here."
aieQrj9Yy8s,SALT move
aieQrj9Yy8s,How is she a feminist john wick? I don't see her making judgements towards men in this film or making statements that relate to feminism (equality).
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Looks great, can't wait."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Go Debby Harry!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I love that the fight scenes are realistic...""true to life"" and not outlandish."
aieQrj9Yy8s,I'm literally just watching this for the sex scene
aieQrj9Yy8s,John Wick at half speed? Looks good though
aieQrj9Yy8s,"My dagger activated "" full erection"""
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I loved the part in John Wick 2 when Ruby Rose thought she was gonna fight John, and then he just killed her with a fair amount of ease. That scene just popped into my head, because there's so many comments about her being a female John Wick.

This fight scene did not look believable, btw."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Really trying to suspend belief in female biology on this piece of crap,feminist propaganda film."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Gonna watch the shit outta this
aieQrj9Yy8s,at 4:03 you can see her shapeshift and she have reptilian eyes
aieQrj9Yy8s,so unrealistic a woman could never do that
aieQrj9Yy8s,I can't fucking wait. Omg this looks so sick
aieQrj9Yy8s,Are heterosexual men really upset that a beautiful woman is making out with another beautiful woman? You gents want big muscular man in the mix? lol. Unbelievable.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Well, if nothing else they have awesome choreography of their fight scenes"
aieQrj9Yy8s,John wick meets suicide squad playlist meets a lesbian that cant fight...
aieQrj9Yy8s,Female James Bond
aieQrj9Yy8s,is this Femme Nikita 2 ? That would be sooo awesome
aieQrj9Yy8s,The 87 eleven guys are at it again.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Defently have to see this movie!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"idk why yall are complaining, this movie looks great"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Meh. I don't care if it's a man or a woman. It just looked to choreographed and slow. This seems like it could be a great movie. Maybe not a good trailer or actress. John Wick Trailer sucks a big bag of d!cks but, the movie was perfect."
aieQrj9Yy8s,This looks fucking STUPID.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Mr. & Mrs. Wick would be coming in a near future? :p
aieQrj9Yy8s,Every straight man dream is to have sex with an lesbian couple. For that scene only it worth seeing the movie.  Regard the fight guys is just fiction. No need to be that harsh.
aieQrj9Yy8s,It feels very James Bond female version to me. Charlize Theron always does so good in her rolls. Looks fun!
aieQrj9Yy8s,I don't know this blonde girl is more like let's just fucking wing it and hope for best
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Everybody is criticising the fighting and there is no reason too. It is realistic, it shows how the bad guys can easily take down the good guy and it probably shows the main characters fighting weaknesses and techniques :)"
aieQrj9Yy8s,Smells like Guy Richie's movie
aieQrj9Yy8s,So what if it's a mashup of action movies we've already seen. I'm watching this!
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Might watch it, cast seem good enough to watch."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Not even feeling it.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Horrible trigger discipline.
aieQrj9Yy8s,John Milf
aieQrj9Yy8s,"The fight acting is absolutely terrible. So bad it's hard to be believed, they even have that little pause that WWF Pro Wrestlers do to set up their ""enemy combatant"", basically this looked on-par with the motherfucking three stooges circa 1932."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"The fight scenes look completely fake. Much like the whole fantasized premise of a woman kicking arse in a fight against several men. Ridiculous. In real life, their are men that can actually fight against several others and win. Never heard of a woman being able to do that, even when highly trained. Once again, Femi-Nazi's at their best. What a joke our society has become. Even movies have become sad excuses for political correctness and Feminist propaganda."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Piece. Of. Crap
aieQrj9Yy8s,Theron's fight scene looks amateurish. She'll serve herself a bit better to spend more time doing some real training before taking on a role like this.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Bisexual Jane Bond? Hell yeah, I dig it."
aieQrj9Yy8s,THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!!!  Best Trailer ever!!
aieQrj9Yy8s,you guys are a bit short sighted as this is based on a graphic novel written well before john wick even became an idea. is it bad thing that we have another film in the genre. it looks well produced. stylish. the violence looks more struggled and real. and it has an oscar winner in the lead. in an era when we get nothing but remakes and sequels this at least looks quite fresh even if its an over saturated genre right now
aieQrj9Yy8s,the mix of feelings and objectivity.  very interesting.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"i like the hollywood concept of women fighters..whoop ,bam,krak, and the blond female takes down 4 fully grown man without a scratch..chreleez theron will get her ass kicked by a 13 year old boy...so fucking stupid"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"for

God's

sake"
aieQrj9Yy8s,the fighting vincent d'onofrio did in daredevil looked much better
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Dude, this guy can make action movies look so beautiful"
aieQrj9Yy8s,looks bada$$üòÉüòçüòÉ
aieQrj9Yy8s,"so many women are ruling it these days... from these examples, i hope it's a good sign. have to watch this...."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Am gonna ask her to make me a sandwich. Good bye world
aieQrj9Yy8s,"So, I don't like RE Movies, because Milla Jojovich looks riddiculous and there are many examples of female centered action Movies were it just looks akward with the overpowerfull female characters. 
But two things about this Movie, Charlize Theron never does a bad role. Second, this looks actually good!"
aieQrj9Yy8s,Everyone says this is a female version of John Wick and doesnt even bother to look up that it's the same director as John Wick.........
aieQrj9Yy8s,Oh look an action ovie in which minions actually know how to fight
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Unrealistic. A man punches a woman that hard in the face and she's down, out cold."
aieQrj9Yy8s,How is this feministic? Look at lesbian sex scenes :)
aieQrj9Yy8s,wow everyone complaining about her the fights john wick this n that..... i was sold at the lesbian sex scene SOLD!
aieQrj9Yy8s,action looks bad...learn from Thailand already hollywood
aieQrj9Yy8s,more of that dominating women thing here.   how dare she treat her unequally?  lol.   Who is the left kidding?  And 50 shades of gray won't save them.
aieQrj9Yy8s,This looks like shit.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Im loving the martial arts and choreography and the story seems intriguing enough
aieQrj9Yy8s,she's got to be John wicks twin sister
aieQrj9Yy8s,You're all missing the point here! Charlize Theron on Sofia Boutella. I don't care how bad the rest is. That's worth the price of admission itself! ;) (j/k)
aieQrj9Yy8s,"How is now a movie with a woman as the main character just trying to be feminist(like it's a bad thing?), it's a fucking movie. I didn't see john wick and thought "" hmm more man hitting men and omg is that a woman he's fighting ?! Woman haters !"" No you fucks I just enjoy the freaking fighting. Surprise a movie that's not realistic what else is new. Also isn't this based on a comic book? You guys talk about ""triggers"" but you can't see a vagina without acting like children"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"3 out of 10, copies too much from other movies"
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Nope. Queen doesnt works on trailers, twice."
aieQrj9Yy8s,LMAO!!!!! I'll just let the cough' Feminist sledgehammer make the joking comment for me. Was there a scheduling conflict with Jolie ....?
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Okay the rush music makes it seem like it's supposed to be a comedy, when it is supposed to be a bad ass woman movie. Make her intimidating and cut the clown shit."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Great camera work
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Yay, another movie where morons celebrate depictions of evil men being beaten to shit by a celebratory protagonist. What a thrill. And wow, it's a woman doing it. How empowering. Humanity is really advancing."
aieQrj9Yy8s,hey feminist this crap will never happen you try to fight a man its 2 hits 1 to your face and the 2nd is you hitting the ground hey hollywood stop with this sjw feminist pandering bull****

aieQrj9Yy8s,the trailer starts off with a very complicated thing.  thinking and feelings.   to control your emotions then think analytically.  that's the core problem with the american left today.  They went off the deep end.
aieQrj9Yy8s,People getting triggered by a woman beating up men
aieQrj9Yy8s,02:27 my goodness.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"If a movie is supposed to be grounded in some sense of reality, don't show a woman the size of Charlize Theron get punched in the face by a thug three times in the space of 10 seconds, then get¬†hit by the heavy contents of that bag, again in the face. Then have her stand up and kick a guy down the stairs as if nothing happened. It's ridiculous."
aieQrj9Yy8s,This looks so good. I adore this woman.

aieQrj9Yy8s,"Everytime i see one of these movies I can help but think of a john wick, liam neeson, james bond type running around and all the enemies were women. Like take the scene in the trailer with the two cops. Wouldn't that have been better if the two cops were women and she just beat the shit outta them. Make that movie they don't have to all be women but throw some women in there for equality sake. Like damn is the only way a women can prove she is strong is to beat up a man.

aieQrj9Yy8s,Anyone else just going through trailers?
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Well, looks like I have a reason to forgive Charlize for Furious 8!"
aieQrj9Yy8s,if there should be a female bond... this is it
aieQrj9Yy8s,le femme nikita??
aieQrj9Yy8s,Everything i need from a movie
aieQrj9Yy8s,"What I'm learning from this comment section is that John Wick has RUINED action movies for people. I mean I get it those movies and Reeves playing that character set the bar pretty dam high. Still though, it's a movie. Who cares that Charlize Theron couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag IRL. She's still fun to watch."
aieQrj9Yy8s,If there are no BLondie song in this movie i will be very disappointed.
aieQrj9Yy8s,I hope this movie not so bad if they use Queen for trailer...because after Suicide squad..
aieQrj9Yy8s,This movie will be a big flop
aieQrj9Yy8s,Jesus Christ. Can we please have one more comment with John Wick in it? I don't think we've had enough.
aieQrj9Yy8s,HOLY SHIT!
aieQrj9Yy8s,Love how Hollywood cries about gun control then drops millions on movies that glorify gun violence.
aieQrj9Yy8s,kiraa quiin daisan no bakudan!!!!!!!!!!!!! bait sa dasto :u
aieQrj9Yy8s,I can only hope this sort of movie doesn't persuade women they can actually fight men.
aieQrj9Yy8s,So many butthurt MRAs here.
aieQrj9Yy8s,James Mcavoy is in here too!!! üòçüòä
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I can Watch Charlize Theron, Angelina Jolie, Kate Beckinsale, Zoe Saldana and Milla Jovovich play Fem fatale type roles all day"
aieQrj9Yy8s,In the end she dies and leaves her husband a letter and a dog right?!
aieQrj9Yy8s,All the comments in the comments section are about james bond and john wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,Why can't feminists at least not touch James Bond and John Wick jesus christ
aieQrj9Yy8s,Ok let me be the first to say this I can see her & John wick in the same movie up against each other i bet it happens
aieQrj9Yy8s,hahahaha feminist john wick

aieQrj9Yy8s,"mulheres se pagando √© muito gostoso de  ver.

aieQrj9Yy8s,Fights look like John Wick on 0.5x speed
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I love Charlize, but such thin woman can't, just can't fight two man in melee, take hits into head, body and simply stand up and knockout them after."
aieQrj9Yy8s,"The lesbian thing was a bit too much, disturbing and rudely unexpected. There has to be something said about all the young impressionable teens who will watch this."
aieQrj9Yy8s,goddamn i hope this isn't what they turned the grey man into.
aieQrj9Yy8s,meh
aieQrj9Yy8s,Mrs John Wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,This looks awful.
aieQrj9Yy8s,"I am going to see this!. Purely for the action, definitely not for the super hot girl on girl action. I love action."
aieQrj9Yy8s,Whats the song?
aieQrj9Yy8s,Would love to see this be part of the John Wick universe.
aieQrj9Yy8s,lesbic üëé

aieQrj9Yy8s,"nice choreography but her weird dull voice ruins everything for me, every time ugh"
aieQrj9Yy8s,wtf is this lame stupid shit
aieQrj9Yy8s,"this looks great...the hell with all you people who want to make the best John Wick jokes in hopes to be quoted.
This looks like a straight forward action shoot'em up flick...the only difference I see , is that it main protagonist is a female in stead of your standard male actor...And I'm all the way cool with that!"
aieQrj9Yy8s,Theron getting‚Äã kicked hard and kicking ass harder
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Get your bags,welcome to Berlin 
For fuck sake"
aieQrj9Yy8s,Oh bollocks!

aieQrj9Yy8s,OOH KAY... IT'S 'SALT' MEETS 'JOHN WICK' WITH A PINCH OF 'TAKEN'... LOL... HOLLYWOOD IS DEFINITELY RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS...
aieQrj9Yy8s,Joan Wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,the action scenes seem poorly acted :/
aieQrj9Yy8s,surprisingly... it actually looks like it might be .. good.. üòï
aieQrj9Yy8s,"The fight scene in the stairs would have been good, if every time she got hit didn't look fake as hell. And her recovery was near instant and also poorly acted."
aieQrj9Yy8s,hot hot hot!!! I love females in action
aieQrj9Yy8s,"who else got ""SALT"" vibes?"
aieQrj9Yy8s,WTF is wrong with people these days bashing atobies because of 90pound woman is lead seriously then why the fuck you all watch superhero movies they have nothing to do with reality stupids everywhere use whatever fits
aieQrj9Yy8s,blonde wick?
aieQrj9Yy8s,john wick version hot gyall...?
aieQrj9Yy8s,"That looks pretty cool! Also, Theron is just great. She seems to be like Keanu Reeves, un-aging... scary..."
aieQrj9Yy8s,OMG I 90lb woman getting hit and taking out hit men....ugh
aieQrj9Yy8s,Joanna Wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,This woman will never get old.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Looks like it could be cool but something tells me it will be lame!
aieQrj9Yy8s,Yeah no... I call bullshit on this one...
aieQrj9Yy8s,Johna Wicker
aieQrj9Yy8s,hello guys my channel is the same channel Zero Media So subscribe and his will be happy for me and for you :D
aieQrj9Yy8s,Salt II
aieQrj9Yy8s,As senas de luta √© muito mal feita! N√£o √© conveniente.
aieQrj9Yy8s,looks cool and Charlize is hot
aieQrj9Yy8s,Wick genre
aieQrj9Yy8s,AKA female john wick.
aieQrj9Yy8s,Apparently feminists saw John Wick
aieQrj9Yy8s,Is this Jessica wick ?
aieQrj9Yy8s,I love that this trailer doesn't feel as though it lasts longer than 3 minutes.
aieQrj9Yy8s,So John wick 3 is looking different
aieQrj9Yy8s,Joan Wick - John Wick's estranged wife???
aieQrj9Yy8s,I've seen a lot of negativity online about this trailer already but I actually think it looks great. The fight scenes look amazing and well shot plus it's good to see a female actress clearly doing most of her own fight work. The only negative for me was the combat sound effects. If that trailer didn't convince people then also bear in mind it's from one of the John Wick directors.
aieQrj9Yy8s,They should've just called the movie Jane Bond
aieQrj9Yy8s,"Holly fucking shit, from John wick director! I'm hyped"

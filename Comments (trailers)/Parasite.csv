SEUXfv87Wpk,LOVED IT!!!!!!!
SEUXfv87Wpk,"South Koreans (Hallyu) -->> MASTERS @ social-commentary!
Japanese -->> MASTERS @ existentialism commentary & intellectual life observations!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,ممكن احد يعطيني  رابط للفيلم مترجم للعربيه😭 يارب🤲🏻 أحد عربي يرد علي 😢
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I laughed a lot watching this film but everything became horrific at the end of the film. 8 of 10.
나는이 영화를보고 많이 웃었다. 그러나 영화의 끝에서 모든 것이 끔찍 해졌다.  10 중 8"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This movie will leave you in Awe. But just when you thought the turns are done, it will hit you again and again and again to the point where youll be just left there clasping a hand in your mouth."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Oh my god, this moviee... 
Worth the hype.. 😍😍😍"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Parasite is a good movie. But not the best Asian film out there. There are more profound Asian films that could use some more recognition as well. But still glad, this film is being shown in US theatres."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"“They’re rich but still nice”
“They’re nice because they’re rich” 
This alone says so much 
This movie was definitely not a slightest lose of time in my life 
A must watch move mid"
SEUXfv87Wpk,BEST MOVIEEE ! I JUST WATCHED THIS GUYS AND THIS IS SOO AMAZING ! STILL CAN'T GET OVER FROM THE ENDING OF THIS MOVIE RECOMMENDED!!!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik are really inseparable. My heart 🤣
SEUXfv87Wpk,I don’t get it
SEUXfv87Wpk,It's a film about how the rich are parasites on the working people ;) Loved it.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I watched it from turkey today. Wow what a movie... 
ı tought it was normal but in second part everything changed"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Best movie. For me. When I was watching I was not pleased but the craziness. The twists.
SEUXfv87Wpk,one of the best movies ever. give it a try 10/10
SEUXfv87Wpk,I actually thought this was some sort of zombie apocalypse
SEUXfv87Wpk,Is it weird that im using my neighbors wifi as well because we cant buy our own rn :/
SEUXfv87Wpk,When will it air on netflix???
SEUXfv87Wpk,they said it was a nice movie..so im looking for the full movie.🙂
SEUXfv87Wpk,WE wonder where we can watch the movie? any spoilers please
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I just finished watching this movie and omg I can't describe my feelings. it made feel shocked and speechless. I really sympathized with the family but at the same time, I felt sorry for those who got fired because of them.  I find it really difficult to categorize the movie. This movie is a combination of romance, horror, comedy, and drama. I still don't get the ending of the movie. Did the son buy the house or did he plan to buy it? What happened to the son's girlfriend who was her tutor? what happened to her is she still in love with him?"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Jesus Christ , I just finished the movie ...."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Saw it tonight.   Brilliantly crafted film.  No cheap plot tricks- everything felt original.  Much darker than expected.  Nonetheless authentic.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"*spoilers *

Slightly overhyped. I give it a solid 7. It kept me interested but the pay off was predictable. 

To add, how the fuck can i feel sorry for the main characters when they killed an innocent person and they got everyone fired through lies?

Okay okay, solid 8. Nothing more"
SEUXfv87Wpk,This film was amazing.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Where could I download the movie with great quality?
SEUXfv87Wpk,is this film related to anime? or something else?
SEUXfv87Wpk,What a perfect trailer holy shit. You think it spoils a lot but it doesn't show ANYTHING tbh. To anyone intrigued by this who hasn't seen the movie yet: IT'S A MASTERPIECE AND I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY PLS GO WATCH IT
SEUXfv87Wpk,미국 예고편은 잘 만들어졌네. 한국 예고편은 너무 많은 걸 알려줘서 실제로 영화볼때 재미가 반감되는 부분이 있었는데 이 예고편은 재미를 유발하는 상당부분을 감추고 있어서 딱 좋다.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Wow! What was that?😱 
This movie is everything and beyond! A masterpiece! 
Watching trailer after the movie!👏🏻"
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie is worth to watch!!! But def I'm not gonna watch it twice 😂
SEUXfv87Wpk,One of the best movies I’ve ever seen holy shit
SEUXfv87Wpk,"%100 not watching this movie, looks the worst,"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Finally!! A trailer that does have an ass ton of spoilers AND actually makes me want to see it!! Bravoooo trailer peeps!! 👏🏼👏🏼
SEUXfv87Wpk,1:46 baho ka’g duga
SEUXfv87Wpk,i just finished this movie and all i hade to say is WOWWWWWW
SEUXfv87Wpk,I like this trailer much more than the other Parasite trailer. This is really intense and the music heightens the mood.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"The most exciting part was the Title ""Parasite"" is starting to make some sense..."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Damn it I thought this was the anime
SEUXfv87Wpk,My first impression was a parasite ( neighbors) who always steal wifi from others 😆
SEUXfv87Wpk,Well this is how you make a trailer
SEUXfv87Wpk,Masterpiece
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Watching song in the movie Host, what a great actor. I knew I recognized him from the trailer, I’m in to see this movie. South Korea has some wonderful films."
SEUXfv87Wpk,i wan't seen this movie...
SEUXfv87Wpk,Anyone know any other must watch Korean film for 2019?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Sooooo what’s this about?
SEUXfv87Wpk,*Came here hoping for a Sifi/horro flick from an Indie film production line like MAGNET*
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Just finished watching it and now I'm spreading the word. This movie is a masterpiece. It's a comedy with some dark moments and its main theme is the same as Joker's - dichotomy of rich and poor. I loved it. Anybody reading this, go watch it right now!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Hollywood movies really suck compared to such Asian masterpieces. This movie made me cry at the end and you know it's a good one when you get involved in it emotionally. Hasta la Vista American Movies :)
SEUXfv87Wpk,Ditunggu
SEUXfv87Wpk,"We need an american remake directed by Kanye, with bunch of illegal mexicans locked up in Trump's Mar-a-Lago basement"
SEUXfv87Wpk,This trailer could be a different movie altogether.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Great trailer! Didn't spoil anything!
SEUXfv87Wpk,"this is a terrible translation tho.. 
it only conveys very superficial meanings"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Watch and learn big bucks Hollywood studios!!
This is how you do a damn good trailer!!!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Saw this movie today. Incredible, go see it."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I hv a question, n it contains big spoiler so the people that havn't watch the movie yet plz stay away from this comment.. 




When ""kim ki"" hid himself in the secret basement of the house,n after that they showed us he's moving around the house during the nights, so how has he been managing to drag back that huge and heavy rack thing into its place from the behind of that rack all by himself?? Did i miss something or they never explained it in the movie??"
SEUXfv87Wpk,When I watched the trailer I thought that someone there is the killer but when I watched the movie I was like *oH–*
SEUXfv87Wpk,I'm so confused
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Done watching the movie. I'll tell you in advance, you'll get amazed of how the story flow. And it was really really good. Highly recommended"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Bwahahaahhaha what a shit!
SEUXfv87Wpk,parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? Or is the system itself the parasite a great movie just finish it
SEUXfv87Wpk,Here after srk tweeted
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I'll be the first to tell you, you may in fact NOT love this movie. 
If you have a weak stomach or are easily offended, aka you are a child, you may not enjoy this movie"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Had my jaw dropped (and stay dropped) for like 10 minutes toward the ending.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"that beautiful house... it was built from scratch for this movie, it was designed according to the script by the production designer and the director."
SEUXfv87Wpk,The movie was just astonnishing!! Great from the start to end. There wasn‘t a single boring scene!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Shahrukh Khan brought me here!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Here after shahrukh Khan's post😉

SEUXfv87Wpk,Anyone here after srk tweet
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This film was so good, does anyone know any others that have a similar style in terms of the way it was shot and that modern feel to it?"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Just watched it and didn't bother to watch the trailer. I literally thought it was the korean live action with the anime Parasite. Damn. I was already in the middle part and was waiting for the parasite to appear but it didn't So I then realized that this is is not a live action at all!! Next time, I won't trust the Movie Title."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Where can I watch the movie with English subtitles
SEUXfv87Wpk,WTF!!!! I didn't understand anything..
SEUXfv87Wpk,what did i just watched???
SEUXfv87Wpk,"It looks kinda interesting. However, I cannot stand the asian accent. I'll  pass"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I'm sorry I had to dislike the video because it was the devil's number when I came. I dont know but it scared me
Edit:someone else disliked it so ima like it now."
SEUXfv87Wpk,I just finished the movie today. And it's fucking amazing. At first I thought it's about a literal parasite but it wasn't.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Amazing movie, a combination of comedy, drama, action, thriller and action-thriller"
SEUXfv87Wpk,This is absolutely 10/10 best movie this year ! Congrats Mr.Bong Joon Ho !!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Even the trailer was made extremely well. Amazing.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Shit anime movie irl
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie is amazing!!!!
SEUXfv87Wpk,is it same as the anime?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"""Parasite"" is such a masterpiece… This is the kind of movie in which I can pause on some shots and literally contemplate them like paintings."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Kept rewatching the trailer to try and figure out the movie but still cant. Lol guess I'll have to wait then
SEUXfv87Wpk,At first I thought it was an action film full of con artists. I was so intrigued and sad while watching this movie. The ending made me soooooo happy 😪🤗 at least I imagined his plan with him
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought it's gonna be a live action from the anime.....
SEUXfv87Wpk,Surely a masterpiece! What a way to tell a story.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Spoiler








after this trailer I thought 'the strangest thing about it' would be some sort of huge family secret but it was literally just a joke about how the girl might be taking drugs. I mean, I laughed in the cinema but this trailer is kind of misleading lol."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"this movie was so amazing, i honestly wish i could relive that moment seeing it again."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Guys I can't watch scary/horror movies, is this anything like that?"
SEUXfv87Wpk,One of the best movies I have ever seen. It is *AMAZING*
SEUXfv87Wpk,And yet I don't know the genre of this movie *I've watched it *😂
SEUXfv87Wpk,One thing I like to say I am Asian I tell you different movie between korea movie and box office American movie you like to know what is different it’s just emotion when sad when happy acting American all world can like korean actors cry or make sad part korea they do it try and make for people look it like true life not just movie iam korea fan cinema I think best in world maker movie
SEUXfv87Wpk,whats it about anyway
SEUXfv87Wpk,I haven’t seen this yet BECAUSE I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE. How are people watching this? I really want to see it.
SEUXfv87Wpk,wtf is this trailer
SEUXfv87Wpk,¿Netflix?...🎁
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I watched this movie yesterday, after a 9 hour shift followed by a class, I was tired, but I couldn't keep my eye off the screen, it was such a good movie!(SPOILER KINDA) The beginning was funny and sometimes sad, but suddenly it turns really dark. It's the best movie I've seen in a while for sure!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Horror masterpiece.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Am I the only one who thought this movie was really good but no where near the 'masterpiece' that everyone is making it out to be?? I mean, I really liked it overall and found it very compelling, but I thought it has some obvious storytelling issues that can''t be overlooked. Please tell me I'm not alone! XD XD"
SEUXfv87Wpk,This is such a cool and sexily crafted trailer. Really gets you excited for it!
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie is a masterpiece ! You should watch it if you haven't yet it's truly magical
SEUXfv87Wpk,"A bit unbelievable. Why would such a cunning, smart family like the Kims be so completely down-and-out. They should have been conning people for a long time before they met the rich Park family."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"at first i thought it was a horror movie about some creepy creature living inside the human. but as im watching the whole trailer i still don't get it what the movie all about then when i reach the Wi-Fi scene i though about free loaders or like the literal meaning of parasites itself, where some just depends or rely on others to survive? i know my explanation sucks. but that's my own understanding of the whole movie all about"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Gw harap endingnya tuan rumah jd creepy. Atau pjelasan bau apa yg ad di sisopir. Lumayan 90% bgus.
SEUXfv87Wpk,no one told me that it contain 18+ I watch this with my brother hm
SEUXfv87Wpk,even the trailer is awesome.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I doubt this will win best picture because the academy never awards it to a foreign language film but i still think this is a masterpiece.
SEUXfv87Wpk,WELL I JUST HAD GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER MY BODY WHILE WATCHING IT. 11/10
SEUXfv87Wpk,Worst birthday party ever
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This movie is superb, the best movie I've watched this year."
SEUXfv87Wpk,I hope this movie wins a oscar
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Some people say that this is also a black comedy, the question is: What kind of dark/black comedy? Is it only ""funny"" for eastern people or for non-asians too?"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Commercial american fantasy movies and anime really dirtied my mind, really need more artsy movie like this"
SEUXfv87Wpk,MASTERPIECE
SEUXfv87Wpk,Ok like
SEUXfv87Wpk,"1:37 is that elderly asian man wearing a native american feather hat? Isn't that cultural appropriation or something?

 The movie looks nicely shot and I do not always see people looking for wifi, like crazy people, that often. So congrats to South Korea for making a thriller movie. Something that has been lacking in the movie industry for a while."
SEUXfv87Wpk,YO this movie was actually really good!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Had watched some great Korean movies over the years and yet Parasite is nothing I've seen before. It will leave you astounded.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Done watching this great film. I gotta say I have different expectation base on the title but  welp its metaphorical. Yet i didnt get the last bit.*spoiler*

SEUXfv87Wpk,It's a Korean horror film about a familly that has no WiFi?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Eita carai
SEUXfv87Wpk,Fake degree gave them access to the kids ideas. It’s sort of what the Chinese and Israelis do with our military and civilian technology.
SEUXfv87Wpk,i was more scared while watching this movie than a horror film! 😒
SEUXfv87Wpk,I can't wait to not see this movie.
SEUXfv87Wpk,the parasite was the scammer family. 👍 nice movie highly recommended.
SEUXfv87Wpk,3 month has passed but still icky and impressed by the movie tho

SEUXfv87Wpk,Just watched the movie it's amazing the real piece of cinema. This movie showed me how well a original idea can work it's a masterpiece it's probably the movie of unique category . It is the best original idea I've seen after the movie birdman no doubt it will win best international feature . Most recommend.
SEUXfv87Wpk,very interesting story..satu keluarga terlibat huhhu sian adik dia mati
SEUXfv87Wpk,"i just watched the movie and i don't what to say. it get so fucked up at the the second half and the whole thing made me uncomfortable and anxious. i absolutely recommend it, it's original and the story just hits cause i mean it's the reality of humans and the society we live in."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Soo it isn't live action version of manga parasyte ?
SEUXfv87Wpk,This trailer told me absolutely nothing and I loved it!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Dam i missed a good trailer ...going to watch this movie

SEUXfv87Wpk,i just came back from seeing this movie and it’s definitely one of the best ones ive seen this year. definitely worth to watch
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought it's anime adaptation but it's not
SEUXfv87Wpk,Hey guys can you send me webside of this movie.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I really enjoyed this movie but it was a little too long. Worth watching but I think it would have been better if they shortened it.
SEUXfv87Wpk,America wishes it could make films of this caliber.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Am i the only one here who watched the movie then this trailer right after
SEUXfv87Wpk,Just watched it in theater.  It should win the Oscar for best foreign language film or even better to become a multi nominated movie like Roma last year
SEUXfv87Wpk,A fucking kino
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Rotten tomato 100% and metacritic 92% ?? 
Wowww but it does deserve the hype it gets tho !
Congratulations to all the people participated in this movie !
Well done everyone 👏👏👏"
SEUXfv87Wpk,10/10 one of the best movies
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Saw yesterday, amazing."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"الفليم قوي قوي أفضل فليم كوري شفته متكامل من أغلب النواحي تبتدي الفليم براسك فكرة ينتهي الفليم بفكرة عكسها تصدم حيييل حبيت من عذر ماخذ جوائز 👏🏼
I am in love with this movie, no wonder it got alot of praise 
Great job!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie sends me into panic mode :( I was shaken to the core :(
SEUXfv87Wpk,Anyone know the song?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"***SPOILER
Surely a good movie. It's not as good as everyone is praising. 


The kim family are bunch of losers and scammers but are showed as protagonists. Could've had better ending.

Park family was so nice to them. Just because they didn't like their smell. Mr Park got killed."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Alright I have to see this after watching the trailer, this movie looks so trippy and intense and am super curious what the hell it is about now if not for the wifi lol also this sound is dope I need that too:P"
SEUXfv87Wpk,That trailer got me hyyyyped
SEUXfv87Wpk,The Host is one of my favorite movies so I definitely have high hopes.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Great movie,  love it❤❤"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Anyone who watched it already!!! 
I have an question.   You know owner of the house (mr.park i guess) is he died?  What happened to that rich family? 
I Can't understand it"
SEUXfv87Wpk,My favourite movie of 2019
SEUXfv87Wpk,I seriously recommend
SEUXfv87Wpk,Loved it. Watched it in Russian language and it was fantastic
SEUXfv87Wpk,We need more movies like this.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Looks terrible
SEUXfv87Wpk,Oh
SEUXfv87Wpk,Hey guys I'm confused is this parasite the maximum? Or is this some kind of other parasite? 😕
SEUXfv87Wpk,"During the every next ""chapter"" (or part) of the movie I was just becoming more and more speechless... Every single turnaround makes you open your eyes stunningly.
Great job 💪🎬"
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie is a true masterpiece. The trailer really doesn’t give away anything.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"very dark korean drama, so sad.... completely change my perspective toward all my employee especially driver and maid... maybe I should break up with my gf too and ask her to leave my place since she came from poor family just like those evil kim... :(("
SEUXfv87Wpk,Mr. Park RESPECT!!!
SEUXfv87Wpk,The Host was an absolute garbage movie with a trillion plot holes and awful characters. Snow piercer however was a fairly good movie. Hopefully this one is good and not overhyped like that awful Host movie.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Just watched it!!! Wowowow!!
SEUXfv87Wpk,This one submitted for Oscars 2020?
SEUXfv87Wpk,I just saw the movie. Darn its good
SEUXfv87Wpk,"First time see the title i think this is like zombie movie, like train to busan. But the trailer not give me clue at all, so im very curious what the ""parasite"" is"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Im never into foreign asian films but this one looks excellent.
SEUXfv87Wpk,마약사죠~
SEUXfv87Wpk,It’s so metaphorical...
SEUXfv87Wpk,the story is about finding a job as an english teacher?
SEUXfv87Wpk,GREETİNGS FROM TURKEY

SEUXfv87Wpk,*KSKWKWKS YESSS IT HAS CHOI WOO-SHIKKKKKK YESSS I LOVE KING.  also who’s hyped for TTB 2??*
SEUXfv87Wpk,Best movie ever
SEUXfv87Wpk,jo yeo jeong in there no nude but she did a masturbation scene on the sofa with her husband and boob fondling I was hoping she show her tits kind of disappointed wanted to see her nude again
SEUXfv87Wpk,Can't wait to be disappointed by the American remake in two years.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I thought at first, the movie title means something like ""the flu"" or ""deranged"" type of movie, but it turns out to be another masterpiece movie from Korea. RECOMMENDED"
SEUXfv87Wpk,How many of you are here after the Oscar news?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Film ini lebih menyindir kesenjangan sosial antara si miskin dan si kaya. Kalo jeli pasti paham paham ini film bukan tontonan biasa. Makanya film ini sampe dapat penghargaan tertinggi cannes film di paris.
SEUXfv87Wpk,this movie was amazing!
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Bong Joon Ho has ridiculed Hollywood again, he is THE master between masters."
SEUXfv87Wpk,The ending really caught me by surprise
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I thought they would have a mind breakdown cause their neighbors changed their wifi password.. 

Well if that happens in real life i would clearly have a mental breakdown and threaten my neighbors that i would kill their cat if they don’t give the new wifi password"
SEUXfv87Wpk,boring
SEUXfv87Wpk,goddamn this movie was not what i expected . near masterpiece
SEUXfv87Wpk,Anyone knows who designed that mansion from the movie?
SEUXfv87Wpk,დაგლიჯა
SEUXfv87Wpk,At first I thought this was a dark comedy but halfway through it was just dark... like a nightmare. The plot twist was creepy in a sense that somehow it can happen to anyone in real life.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Literally watched the whole trailer and didn't understand any of it. Sign me up
SEUXfv87Wpk,"That's a wide, wide aspect ratio."
SEUXfv87Wpk,The trailer completely misleads you. Until you watch the movie. It’s an absolute masterpiece
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Can someone please give me the name of the trailer song. Really looking forward to knowing it, thank you <3"
SEUXfv87Wpk,IN-FUCKING-CREDIBLE
SEUXfv87Wpk,Awesome film
SEUXfv87Wpk,Great movie..... 🤔 Any similar Korean movies
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Heard this movie received an award at the Cannes Film Festival and seeing how it was a Korean film I was curious as to what it was about. Just based on the trailer it looks really good, and I recognized a few faces from kdramas I've watched. I’m going to go watch it right now and tell you if it’s good.


Edit: Holy. Crap. This movie was amazingly good. I'll be dumb-struck if it doesn't receive any Oscar nominations. I honestly wasn't expecting it to turn out so dark. The ending was really unexpected and had me going wtf. I strongly recommend you guys watch it--it's totally worth your time."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Great film!
SEUXfv87Wpk,"best tralier I have ever watched .
it don't give a thing"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Wait...this is a scary movie?! I thought it was a romantic comedy!
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Guys,rec to me movie like this,please?"
SEUXfv87Wpk,its a nice movie worth to watch
SEUXfv87Wpk,i though koriyans are good people..what is the example set hear by this movie..if somebody done lot of cheating and kill somebody (innocent) he will deceive  good things some day that is the thing korians like to be happen in real world.  that why they like this movie and tack 8.5 IMDB ..soo pathetic and sorry for you korians
SEUXfv87Wpk,I think this is one of the best korea  movie I've ever watched! We still think about it days after 😅
SEUXfv87Wpk,why everytime i watch movies ki woo is always there😂 just like yesterday i watched divine fury and now i watch the witch and then this one😂😂
SEUXfv87Wpk,Oscer on the way👍
SEUXfv87Wpk,Who thought this was a film adaptation for the parasite manga ?! I was hyped for moment
SEUXfv87Wpk,"You don't understand the trailer? Well for sure, the movie won award for reasons. Watch it ;)"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I'm Korean. 
If you don't watch this movie, you're missing a valuable life opportunity.

I had so many thoughts about the aftermath that I had a headache, and I couldn't compare it to any other movie, it was amazing all the time. jun-ho bong is a genius😮"

You won’t know where this film is going because it’s unlike any story that’s been told before!! I was on the edge of my seat in a film that I expected to be moderately lackluster at the beginning of the film."
SEUXfv87Wpk,*DOWNLOAD MOVIEHD TO WATCH IT IN HD*
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie is a masterpiece.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"The ending is so beautifully sad , I kept on thinking about it ever since I've watched it"

SEUXfv87Wpk,I have no idea what tgis is about but I think im going to watch ot to find out
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Just watched the movie... FINALLY A TRAILER THAT DOESNT SHOW NOTHING AT ALL!

SEUXfv87Wpk,The movie is hella good
SEUXfv87Wpk,i was on the edge of my seat during tge last 45 mins of the show. very well made and unlike any other film ive watched. Dont watch the trailer in full so you dont get a glimpse of some things.
SEUXfv87Wpk,If this movie doesnt get best picture nominee at oscar.. I am gonna be so mad
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie made me open my mouth for a good 40mins maybe haha 10/10
SEUXfv87Wpk,I watched the movie first now seeing the trailer
SEUXfv87Wpk,So connecting to your neighbour's Wi-Fi (taking without giving back ANYTHING in return) is actually the whole movie's idea huh.... I don't wanna give spoilers but that's a huge metaphor for the whole damn movie and I like
SEUXfv87Wpk,Not watching this trailer before I even watched the movie was the best decision I've ever made.
SEUXfv87Wpk,You know what's crazy? 2 hours long and i thought that ki jung is kim go eun this whole time omg how?
SEUXfv87Wpk,This is not an ordinary movie but a must watch movie. You’re gonna learn a lot and realize a lot and you may not look at some people the way you did before
SEUXfv87Wpk,One of the best movie of this year. I’m not gonna say anything and the name.. just perfect. I’ve seen very rarely title so suitable along with its versatility. I recommend this 100%

SEUXfv87Wpk,That editing that the end made me chuckle
SEUXfv87Wpk,This guy's framing is amazing .i love the way he sets up his camera very similar to david fincher and his narration style is brilliant. I have just seen memories of murder and going to see all of his movies.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This should be Korea's next submission to the oscars. Hopefully it gets nominated (or even better, a win!)"
SEUXfv87Wpk,The movie is sooooo worth it
SEUXfv87Wpk,I don't understand what it's about haha

SEUXfv87Wpk,"The kind of movies you watch it one time.. fuck your brain, get depressed and never watch it again in your life time! bring back memories of old boy."
SEUXfv87Wpk,DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST! 10/10! Any other movies as good as this?
SEUXfv87Wpk,But stop i have a question why the dad killed his boss like why it didn't make sense.. I was shocked
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought this was about wifi
SEUXfv87Wpk,Definitely a must watch movie. Awesome/amazing.

SEUXfv87Wpk,"Just finished watching, awesome movie."
SEUXfv87Wpk,I haven't been this surprised/heartbroken since Oldboy ):
SEUXfv87Wpk,I enjoy the lack of spoiler in this trailer.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"got excited about it being an adaptation of parasyte, but still not disappointed. this looks interesting. but I swear if it ends as depressing as the Shoplifters (because it looks similar) I would be so saaaaaaad."
SEUXfv87Wpk,I was so confused at first  my dumb ass thought this a movie was about WiFi worshipping for a few seconds
SEUXfv87Wpk,10/10
SEUXfv87Wpk,I need to see this. God.
SEUXfv87Wpk,This is how every trailer must be done.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"[SPOILER] Warning!  This movie has soft porn.  His sister was killed.  His father killed their boss and disappeared.  The mother and the man were not sentenced, the man was diagnosed ill. Watch one of the final part on my channel."
SEUXfv87Wpk,why is the name parasite?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Wow, im just loss in words, the movie, is amazing, i was so shocked because i didnt expect anything of that to happen because they didnt spoil anything in the trailer. I experienced all kinds of emotions watching that movie, Koreans are really freaking good at making movies, please continue, by the way, please watch this movie, it wont disappoint you. Good job to the actors, amazing acting and to the people who made this movie, bravo."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Bruh I through its was a live action anime show called parasyte but I didn't expected this
SEUXfv87Wpk,Maybe this movie will tell about pineapple under the sea.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I watched this the movie is still pretty good keeps you interested
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I just watched this maybe 10mins ago and I already went here to review the movie.

YOU.GUYS.SHOULD.NOT.MISS.THIS.MOVIE.

When I first watched the trailer, I was like ""What the hell is that. I didnt understand"".

So for you to understand, watch the movie. And prepare for a roller coaster ride of intensity and emotions.

My rating: 10/10

Hands down to the director and call staff who made this awesome movie 👏👏"
SEUXfv87Wpk,After watching the trailer I’m even more confused.
SEUXfv87Wpk,A masterpiece that grows long after you finished; Best movie of the year
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Very good movie .
Crying like a baby"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"*Exclusive - Parasite (2019) film* Available  my.su/prsed?mdn

SEUXfv87Wpk,This film really really creepy
SEUXfv87Wpk,They copied the Handmaiden trailer style. But still very nice.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I just watched this one on Sarajevo Film Festival. It's AMAZING. U should watch it.

SEUXfv87Wpk,I just watched it and I can say that this kind of movie I will recommend people to watch
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Now this is how people should make movie trailers. It reveals the movie but not to the point where you learn too much about it. Just to the point where it can peak your interest a bit and get you to watch it.

EDIT: omg just finished the movie. It was phenomenal. I don’t even know how to describe it. I think everybody needs to watch this it was truly amazing."
SEUXfv87Wpk,When I watched this film as if my heart and my mind rode roller coaster. Unexpected ending yet still feeling sad to both of their families.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Just prepare! Another masterpiece is on the way.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"The best movie i have watched this year. 10/10 recommend, if you can watch it without knowing much beforehand it would make the experience even better."
SEUXfv87Wpk,I found out about this from Hideo Kojima's twitter
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Very interesting film, I watched it last night."
SEUXfv87Wpk,1:47 she kind of looks like Sarah Paulson
SEUXfv87Wpk,Now this is how to make an excellent trailer guys!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Can someone tell me what it is about ?????
SEUXfv87Wpk,I already watch the anime and Japanese version of it hope it will be dope .
SEUXfv87Wpk,One of the better films to come out in a long time! I went into this movie completely blind and didn't know anything about the movie (except that it's a thriller) prior to watching it. This movie had everything I could want in a thriller. 9.5/10 definitely recommended!

SEUXfv87Wpk,"Back from the cinema, driving while thinking of this movie, it strikes me that parasites will live healthy and well leeching of the host while the host suffers from all sort of problems, suddenly I became angry at everything."
SEUXfv87Wpk,This is how you do a trailer... don't reveal anything.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Just finished the movie. Pretty fked up and a fantastic movie. My top 5 of 2019 straight away.

SEUXfv87Wpk,"Memories of a Murder and Parasite will remain one of my fav movies. I doubt any other movie can make me laugh, smile and before I know it, put me on the edge of my seat like both of the movies did. Everyone, especially in Asia needs to watch Parasite, we will all relate to the class struggle that is tearing our societies apart."

SEUXfv87Wpk,i felt like lost hope after finishing movie for the first time.burning and parasite.... well idk what comes next year
SEUXfv87Wpk,"If you still don't know what the movie is about after watching the trailer, just think about what parasite does. Then, when you start to watch the movie, you will immediately know what I mean."
SEUXfv87Wpk,this movie is got me shook!!!!
SEUXfv87Wpk,*ITS MUST BE THE BEST FILM THIS YEAR*
SEUXfv87Wpk,"When I saw director of snow piercer, I knew this movie was going to be hella creepy"
SEUXfv87Wpk,if you clicked thiniking its about parasyte the anime you clicked the wrong video
SEUXfv87Wpk,I was so clueless with the trailer. I was not even persuade to watch this film in the big-screen. So i will just wait for it to stream online and watch the whole film.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Venom not gonna like it, if it know the title of this movie"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Good to see LG G3 be part of this movie lol
SEUXfv87Wpk,They all deserve an Oscar for their amazing acting and the story line was so not Expected
SEUXfv87Wpk,"i just really scaring to watch this. I don't know what to say, This kind of korean movies always makes me feel like too empty, shockedand mind blown. I really liked this trailer and also scared to watch this, that's the saddest thing."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Just saw this film on KISSASIAN... It is a MASTERPIECE i would reccommend everyone to watch this film... Burning undoubtedly deserved an oscar nom this year but i hope this becomes Koreas first oscar nomination it deserves it
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Spoilers ahead:

The word ""masterpiece"" gets used a lot these days to the point that its lost its meaning. People would even call blockbuster popcorn flicks a ""masterpiece"" these days. That being said, I gave this movie a watch out of curiosity after I saw a few people deem it a ""masterpiece"". This movie is literally like the Japanese movie Shoplifters, only instead of shoplifting to survive, this family leeches off of other people to survive. The story starts with the premise that this family leeches off of other people to survive down to even stealing wifi from other people. Koreans do a great job of making unlikeable characters as protagonists since I felt the same dislike I had towards the protagonists of this movie towards the protagonists of The Handmaiden. Unlike Shoplifters, this movie made each member of the parasitic family dislikeable to the point that you wish death upon them. The daughter of the parasitic family (Ki-jeong) in particular was so unlikeable to the point that I wished death upon her as I watched the movie. Hell,she was acting and speaking like a drunk would for most of the movie and even spoke like a drunkard as she was getting stabbed by the deranged husband of the housekeeper and bleeding to death. I liked the social commentary this movie had by showing the divide of class between the rich and the poor. It also had its moments of black comedy humor here and there. I would have been angry if these characters got a happy ening but I'm glad its a grim and bleak ending we got at the end. Altho, how Ki-Woo survived getting hit with a stone twice on the head is beyond me. I'm no neurosurgeon but how he is functioning as a normal human being despite that and avoided braindamage makes me question if this is possible. Overall, I enjoyed the movie despite its initial predictability of the family members replacing the servants of the rich family and enjoying a life of leisure the house of this rich family had to offer as they worked for them. For me, things started taking a turn when it was revealed that the former housekeeper was leeching off of this rich family as well and had a husband held up in the bunker whom she fed regularly. Thats when my interest peeked since I was about to give up on this movie when I saw these unlikeable characters enjoy a luxurious lifestyle as they leeched off the rich family. It would have been nice if the protagonists were more likeable and if this rich family they leech off were mean or abusive instead of the nice family they were potrayed to be in the movie since that would have given us a chance to root for the former despite the parasitic family's sins. Either way, the film takes a bit to get interesting and to get out of the bowels of predictablility but despite that, I wouldn't call it a ""masterpiece"" like most reviewers claim it to be. I have never seen a movie made by Bong Joon-ho so I'm completely unbiased since most people will call anything made by their favorite directos a ""masterpiece"" these days. Watch this movie only if you have patience and can withstand unlikeable characters."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This one is a masterpiece, truly a masterpiece."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Definitely worth watching,don't sleep on this movie people"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Was thinking this is horror movie
SEUXfv87Wpk,What a great movie. Seen it twice in order to understand how brutal the differences between the rich and poor in our society.
SEUXfv87Wpk,My Mister
SEUXfv87Wpk,Not my kind of anime
SEUXfv87Wpk,Why Mr Kim (driver) stab knife on Mr Park(the boss) ? Any clue or opinion want to share?
SEUXfv87Wpk,I will never see that house the same ever again. The movie just traumatized me... in a mixed emotions sort of way.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Comical? YES!
SEUXfv87Wpk,"The good thing about korean horror/thriller movies is that you forgot about its genre and when it hits you, it be like something else."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"മലയാളികൾ ആരെങ്കിലും ഈ ട്രെയ്‌ലർ തേടി വരും.
അതാണ് നമ്മളും കൊറിയൻ സിനിമയും തമ്മിലുള്ള ബന്ധം."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Um yea no
SEUXfv87Wpk,Too sad his sister dead

SEUXfv87Wpk,Bad movie lol ...
SEUXfv87Wpk,This is a true modern masterpiece
SEUXfv87Wpk,The more I think about it both families are actually parasites to one another
SEUXfv87Wpk,I’ve watched this movie. It’s really something else. Plot twist at the max
SEUXfv87Wpk,I really want to see this but I dont think it will come out in England
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Is this an adaptation of the anime Parasyte?

Greets from the Philippines 🇵🇭"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"The movie was great, but you shouldn't watch the trailer"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I cannot understand a single fucking thing
SEUXfv87Wpk,That’s how you make a trailer
SEUXfv87Wpk,Masterpiece 👏👏
SEUXfv87Wpk,The trailer makes me curious to watch the movie.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Is there a dub version?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Holy moly mother of god  0_o
SEUXfv87Wpk,Movie was AMAZING! Def recommend
SEUXfv87Wpk,"You gotta know and see that we
Are too clever to be human
We all are absolute predators
We do not even have any enemies
But maybe an animal watching us now
Takes a vow: ""Someday we will bring them down!""
I wish that we could hide away
Wear this flesh and rule the world
Through all our lies – Our disguise
But they'll never get to realize
They were born with this fate
Beating hearts slowly dying
But still I wonder when will they find out?
That at a point there is no return
Our reign will prevail
I keep calling out your name
So you know I'm still here to wipe away your tears
If we fall, at least we're falling as one in the end
Let me take your last breath"
SEUXfv87Wpk,a brilliant movie.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I have seen this movie already and I give 10 out of 10.

SEUXfv87Wpk,"I just watched it and I confidently can say it's not just one of the best Korean movies ever, but also one of the best movies of all time. The two twists at the end literally blew my mind, it from funny, silly and dark comedy to scary, intense and very deep. When I thought Korean film industry can't get any better at making thriller crime movies such as I saw the devil, Memories of murder, The wailing... they decided to come up with this 👏"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Dkt Malaysia rating film nih tinggi gilerrrr, tasabar nk tgk"

SEUXfv87Wpk,Oh i love snowpiercer. A must watch for me then
SEUXfv87Wpk,Why did I think it was a live action of the anime Parasite? It's not even Japanese in the first place
SEUXfv87Wpk,Highly recommended 💯

SEUXfv87Wpk,"ladies and gentleman, I present to you Taneliaaa taifannn the colector"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I don't get it lol.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I regretted going to the theater to watch this. I went because of both the reviews and the trailer. I left half way through. At every new scene I felt like the movie was asking if the audience is stupid, and by the looks of it, since so many people like it, apparently it is.
.."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Loved this movie. A masterpiece indeed
SEUXfv87Wpk,i dont get the point in the trailer??? THE HECK??
SEUXfv87Wpk,Is this film horror??
SEUXfv87Wpk,This reminds me of that anime. Parasyte. Lol.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I'm so confused.. yet I really wanna watch this now 🤣
SEUXfv87Wpk,My only issue with this trailer is that it made 0 sense to me what so ever
SEUXfv87Wpk,...Uh... Youtube Recommended? Why are you showing me trailers for movies I don't care about?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"korean movies always lack depth and class

SEUXfv87Wpk,"This is a bad movie ever  i wached, i think there a ghost, it appear the killer🖕👎"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I misclicked under the assumption that this was for PARASYTE.
SEUXfv87Wpk,People should go to jail by not watching it. It's THAT good.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"New film from Bong Joon-Ho? 
Take my money."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This movie is just a masterpiece ! Best movie of the year so far 

And Bong Joon-Ho is a real genius"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Looks like an asian version of borgman
SEUXfv87Wpk,Where's Migi?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I thought it was a out the anime, but can't go wrong with Bong Joon ho."
SEUXfv87Wpk,now thats a movie trailer it tells says nothing of the story and just shows some parts that tell you almost nothing not like some trailers that are the movie in 4 mins cut
SEUXfv87Wpk,Director said in interview that he asked trailer makers not to reveal any story and details in trailer
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I thought it was ""kiseijuu sei no kakuritsu"" the movie lol"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This looks amazing, I can't wait to see this."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Hi where can i download full episode?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Is this the Anime Live Action?
SEUXfv87Wpk,what
SEUXfv87Wpk,🤦🤦🤦 I thought it was a live action for the anime
SEUXfv87Wpk,What a perfect trailer. Reveals the bare minimum and is vigorously enticing.
SEUXfv87Wpk,What the fuck is this pointless shit ?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This is what a trailer is supposed to be like, doesn't show too much or too little. Balance!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Feels like a Yorgos Lanthimos film 😍
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought it a live action movie about parasite anime
SEUXfv87Wpk,So when does he got the alien in his hand ? ✋
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This is a master piece totally deserved the palme d'or make sure you watch it when it comes out it will be worth it!
Great movie"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I tought this movie wold be great but when i watch it wasnt that great and the thriller only start at the end of the movie soo you wont got the full experience of thriller in the movie and the story wasnt that great and the story was soo simple
SEUXfv87Wpk,Where can I watch this in US?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Any links for the full movie??
SEUXfv87Wpk,they already knew it was a masterpiece 😂 can't wait to see it!
SEUXfv87Wpk,Tarantino had some competition this year
SEUXfv87Wpk,Koreans make extremely good movies and extremely cringey TV shows
SEUXfv87Wpk,"what is this about? 








hope it goes straight to Asian Dvd"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Inu di tayangin di indonesia gak ya
SEUXfv87Wpk,"From the director of The Host and Snowpiercer, IM IN, love those 2 movies and im excited to see this one, like the music in this trailer as well."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"That music didnt go with the flipping of all those video shots.. Just shows a kid drawing,  blowing on an onion and a girl moving a rock @ 1:32 But over all I thought it was a movie on how a family that leeches of free wifi gets their wifi blocked by a new family that moves upstairs."
SEUXfv87Wpk,That's a lot of big stars as side characters
SEUXfv87Wpk,this trailer show nothing..  just see in the cinema
SEUXfv87Wpk,Pensaba que era una adaptación de parasyte the Maxim v:
SEUXfv87Wpk,Like wtf trailer? I didnt understand a crap
SEUXfv87Wpk,This going to be better than Pulp Fiction (I guess).
SEUXfv87Wpk,Is this online somewhere?
SEUXfv87Wpk,I loved snowpiercer but i hope that kid winds up getting brutally murdered that would make it suspenseful
SEUXfv87Wpk,... so what is this about?
SEUXfv87Wpk,This is how trailers are supposed to be. Most trailers these days give everything away
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought this was gonna be a live action from an anime called Parasyte but apparently not. 😅
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Ok to whomever make this trailer, yall deserved a raise. I have not a single clue what the movie is about but I'm intrigued"
SEUXfv87Wpk,so for those who watched it already.... how was it?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Wheres the parasite?
SEUXfv87Wpk,...what?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Borgman? Are you here borgman?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Sucky sucky luv u long time.
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I thought it was a korean adaptation of the anime ""parasite"". 😂😂😂"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Is this movie about a family that unintentionally murders another family? Because that's what I got from this trailer.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Where's migi?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Bagusan kiseiju live action
SEUXfv87Wpk,I'm sure the film is great but what even is this trailer?
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought it was a live action of parasyte anime
SEUXfv87Wpk,I’ve seen the movie and it was amazing. I don’t even really know how to describe it but it’s definitely a must-see for everyone. It’s been stuck in my head for over a week now.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought it was a live action parasite movie
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Best selling south Korean film in Indonesia. At least 250,000 times people for watching this movie."
SEUXfv87Wpk,the trailer show part of the movie which overall not clearly explain what the movie about and the title parasite is not helping.i guess at first is about comedy then when become english teacher using forged degree i assume is drama actually but more at the end it change become horror or crime thriller.so actually is movie about what ?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Curious...
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This trailer gave me the same vibes from the Korean movie with Steven Yeun, Burning."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Definitely gonna watch this.
SEUXfv87Wpk,One of the best trailers of the last twenty years
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I am confused, what is the story about and why the music with random scenes"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Oh so this isnt Kisejuu?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"1st i thought.. ohhh, parasite, sounds like horror.. then.. ohh.. parasite coz they're trying to leech of of their neighbor's wifi, then.. ohhh.. parasite coz they're trying to leech of of wealthy peoples money maybe.. then.. ohhh.. it is horror"
SEUXfv87Wpk,So what's this movie about?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Oh parasite not parasyte
SEUXfv87Wpk,Awesome trailer 😎👌
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought this was a Movie about the anime Parasyte at first lol
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Korea has the best trailers ever
this
handmaiden
burning"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I watched the whole trailer and have no idea whats going on. I love it
SEUXfv87Wpk,"South Korea is widely expected to choose “Parasite” as its official entry for the 2020 foreign language Oscar race. The country has never received a nomination in the category, which would give “Parasite” another historic honor if it receives a nomination."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"i watched it. 9,5/10. Awesome!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Is the actress from Goblin the main lead? 😮
SEUXfv87Wpk,11:47 carti’s verse in earfquake intensifies
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Now, this is a trailer 👏"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"One of the best movies of the year, hands down."
SEUXfv87Wpk,this looks really interesting but I feel like I lack the brain depth to actually enjoy it lmfaoooo . sucks being stupid yall
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Bravo, masterpiece."
SEUXfv87Wpk,here i was thinking of a parasyte live action
SEUXfv87Wpk,"South Korea is so Competitive
Korean Films are getting good and good"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Who else thought it's Parasite The Maxim Live Action?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Award Winning Film
A Must Watch Kdrama"
SEUXfv87Wpk,wow from the director of snowpiercer. that movie had a metaphore so hamfisted I had to use my rapewistle. terrible
SEUXfv87Wpk,So this isn't the same parasite as the one with the alien eggs landing on earth that make man eating morphing monsters?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Title made me think of post-apocalyptic zombies infested by parasites. Or an epidemic movie.

Trailer made me think of my Maths teacher: confusing"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Count me in to watch a movie directed by the guy who directed ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"""
SEUXfv87Wpk,shouldn't try to figure out before watching this masterpiece movie 10/10
SEUXfv87Wpk,this is how a trailer should be made.not a clue.lets watch
SEUXfv87Wpk,"People say that they don't know what genre this movie belongs to. It's a Korean movie, so obviously it's a DRAMA. All Korean movies are DRAMAS, they don't know how to make anything else."
SEUXfv87Wpk,I have no idea what this movie is about. Trailer did a good job on giving nothing away lol.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Almost every day i saw this movie ads around Korea and didn't event know the title.. and now here the answer
SEUXfv87Wpk,Looks riveting
SEUXfv87Wpk,I clicked because I see the best korean actor song kang hoo
SEUXfv87Wpk,Who else thought this was a live action of anime parasite
SEUXfv87Wpk,Hollywood will remake this movie.
SEUXfv87Wpk,When does this come out in the UK???
SEUXfv87Wpk,*insert parasyte op*
SEUXfv87Wpk,Fuck I thought it was based on the anime
SEUXfv87Wpk,I watched this movie without seeing the trailer or hearing anything about the story. Let's just say it took a turn that I wasn't expecting. I definitely recommend it if you're okay with seeing blood.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Where and how do I watch????
SEUXfv87Wpk,It's the guy from boy next door
SEUXfv87Wpk,i have no idea what the plot is but im intrigued
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I just watched this movie and i must say... wow. it's the ""i didn't see that coming"" type of movie and completely blows my mind."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"If I could give this movie 11 stars out of 10 I would. No, gotta be 20!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This movie is absolutely astonishing, if you can find it somewhere please see it.
 Its the kind of film where you shake your head in disbelief like you can't believe what you're actually watching/"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"They're gonna freeloading right, so that's why it called parasyte. the tittle and thumbnail gives away everything don't Cha think?"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Glory to the holy WIFI!!!
SEUXfv87Wpk,"i you can't understand the whole movie from the trailer, it's must be great movie"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Snowpiercer was a masterpiece so I’m not surprised this was well received as well.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Thought this was an anime adaptation
SEUXfv87Wpk,One of the best movie ever 😭😭😭
SEUXfv87Wpk,WHY DOES IT SOUND INTENSE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A ROMCOM OR A SITCOM PLOT?
SEUXfv87Wpk,is the ANIME PARASITE?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I cant tell whats the story about

Now thats a trailer"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I still don't get it.....
SEUXfv87Wpk,This trailer told me nothing about the movie.
SEUXfv87Wpk,This movie was good except for the unnecessary porno scene and the ending. I think this would make a good drama series.
SEUXfv87Wpk,So....I'm assuming Shinich & Migi haven't been revealed?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"WHAT???
I thought it was a movie about the Japanese Anime...!!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Will it be showing in the US
SEUXfv87Wpk,😏😏 when is it out?
SEUXfv87Wpk,I don’t really understand the concept everything just seems really scattered
SEUXfv87Wpk,can someone explain what the movie is about? like a synopsis? i like spoilers too and i want to watch but im afraid i wont like it
SEUXfv87Wpk,Dari trailer nya ga menarik sama sekali cuk wkwk
SEUXfv87Wpk,I wish BTS V could star in a movie like this. It will really suit him.
SEUXfv87Wpk,From the title I thought this film is about alien or something but damn I was wrong lol
SEUXfv87Wpk,"If it's better than Shoplifters,then i'll give it a try


Edited: Shoplifters is way more better than this."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Ah I want to watch itttr
SEUXfv87Wpk,For a moment there I thought this was a Parasyte Live Action made by Koreans
SEUXfv87Wpk,Release this in theatres REEEEE
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought it was a horror movie or something!
SEUXfv87Wpk,You need to watch this movie. Worths your time.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought this was a live action of Parasite the maxim
SEUXfv87Wpk,Looks like a wannabe
SEUXfv87Wpk,Shit I don't know the hell is going on in this trailer but seems like its damn awesome movie anw🤔 😋😂
SEUXfv87Wpk,I though this was going to be a Korean version of Parasyte.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought that was the live action movie from the anime parasite
SEUXfv87Wpk,This looks amazing!
SEUXfv87Wpk,_PARASITE?!_ *_APOLOGIZE!_*

SEUXfv87Wpk,The best film ever
SEUXfv87Wpk,"When I saw this, I thought anime Parasite. lol"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"This trailer shows a lot but shows nothing for the movie which is GREAT!!
I’m actually even more curious now! 
The trailer shows tidbits that made me have expectations on what it’ll be but when it shows another scene its something different again and kept stirring my brain for it. AAAAAHHHH I’M ACTUALLY EXCITED!!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Un film à voir absolument

SEUXfv87Wpk,"The poor mans dad killed one of their family member. And there's a bunker, morse code"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I dont understand the trailer. Whats is this about??
SEUXfv87Wpk,What is this
SEUXfv87Wpk,You know its gonna be a good movie when you’ve seen the trailer and has no idea what its all about
SEUXfv87Wpk,trailer that does not ruin the story! interesting
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Me watching parasite in cinema in first 40 minute

Me:owh this is just a  crime comedy movie,ok.


Bong joon ho : are you sure about that?"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I love the trailer, because I did not really give any hints what is about to happen"
SEUXfv87Wpk,I'm fascinated but how gory is it? I have a weak stomach for graphic violence...
SEUXfv87Wpk,watched it and Im speechless. the plot and the theme is impeccable. love choi woo shik even more now (｡´∀｀)ﾉ
SEUXfv87Wpk,"For my perspective who already watch the entire movie, the trailer looks dope to not spill too much context of the actual movie so you can take the new experience when you sit down on theatre."
SEUXfv87Wpk,this man breathes art. wth.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought its gonna be the parasyte anime new live action but it turns out to be a different movie but its cool too i guess
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I watch it without seeing the trailer, only saw the poster. At first, I tought this is about an alien / virus / animal that wanted to take over humanity but I was wrong (in a good way). This is really a good movie."
SEUXfv87Wpk,So its not live action huh . . . .
SEUXfv87Wpk,What?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Bong Joon-ho also directed Okja
SEUXfv87Wpk,Intriguing.
SEUXfv87Wpk,Man this movie was fucking GOOD!
SEUXfv87Wpk,I was scared it's gonna be another horrible live action version of anime...
SEUXfv87Wpk,Why is the movie title is parasite?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"What, I'm lost."
SEUXfv87Wpk,Just watched this movie today and tbh I don’t really like it. It’s good though that many people can appreciate it.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I love the fact that I don't understand anything from the trailer but it managed to tickle my curiosity. This is how trailers should be made. How I wish I could get the chance to watch this.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I was damned scared to watch the trailer as I thought it would be similar to Parasyte
SEUXfv87Wpk,masterpiece
SEUXfv87Wpk,When is this showing?
SEUXfv87Wpk,Even taehyung and jungkook watched it  I want to watch it too where can I watch it ??
SEUXfv87Wpk,"wow im so curious right now, thought this was a reboot on Parasyte the maxim live action but man i was wrong. From The Host and Snowpiercer will be a no brainer for me, count me in!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,ISN'T THAT CHOI WOO SHIK???
SEUXfv87Wpk,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)

SEUXfv87Wpk,Parasyte is better
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Parasite = because they take advantage of a host. Enriching themselves at the cost of the other party.

Nice trailer 👌🏻👍🏻"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Bong Joon Jo and Song Kang Ho. Always a dynamic couple.
SEUXfv87Wpk,I thought it was gonna be about the wifi. I mean they talked about it for a good few seconds

SEUXfv87Wpk,When and where can I watch this? Korean drama/cinema hasnt disappointed yet and this looks really really good
SEUXfv87Wpk,Soo what’s the conflict in the movie?
SEUXfv87Wpk,"Bruh, i don't know how they can come up with such a story.. like holy cow it's fricking roller coster! AMAZING!!!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,"During Parasite screening:

ME: LOL so funny!
Parasite: SURPRIIISE MADAFAKA!"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Its been awhile I watched a  movie trailer left with no idea what is it about. It seems like a crime movie but the ending more like horror thriller.

SEUXfv87Wpk,"I don't know why people complain about the trailer lmao, the trailer is perfect, it doesn't spoil the whole fucking movie and all its highlights like most hollywood trailers do."

SEUXfv87Wpk,"I have no idea what's going on, dab"

SEUXfv87Wpk,"Some say its a terrible trailer but to me it peeked my interest immensely. It made me want to watch the movie just to get to know the sequence of events. It did a perfect job of gaining my attention without revealing the concept of the movie. Plus i have been a choi woo shik fan for many years, he's such a great and loveable actor."
SEUXfv87Wpk,i thought that it was the live adaptation of the anime 😂 but it’s still very nice ahahah
SEUXfv87Wpk,the trailer is so well done. it unlike most trailers today that practically give away the movie’s plot away

I still feeling goosebumps every time I remember that particular scene near the ending"
SEUXfv87Wpk,Someone is playing Overwatch as Sombra in practice range if you guys look closely
SEUXfv87Wpk,"I think the trailer trying not to give spoiler to their viewers. And i think thats a good choice. Bcos if we knew about the whole story, we never get this kind of feeling when watching this movie. So the staff already made a right decission. 


This movie is sooooooooooooo great. I love of everything in this movie. Thank u for all staff to make this masterpiece."
SEUXfv87Wpk,"this trailer gives NOTHING away. all it does is just play with y'all expectations, as it should."

QkZxoko_HC0,I made my ex-girlfriend pick up her litter too!  Sigh...I guess that's why she's an ex LOL!
QkZxoko_HC0,"This trailer has an excellent balance of pathos and humor. I am sold. If the movie manages the same, it will be worth it."
QkZxoko_HC0,"Pick it up Tony.
The squirrels will eat it anyway.
Pick it up."
QkZxoko_HC0,This is like a movie that would come out in the 90s (starring Robert De Niro And Denzel Washington)
QkZxoko_HC0,"yeah, im in."
QkZxoko_HC0,"The Green Book was a pre-Civil Rights Era African-American travel guide which identified ""safe-spaces"" for the black traveler, i.e., places where you could get a meal and a bed and live through the night. Of course, for that reason, it was a book for affluent African-Americans, of which traveling musicians were the majority. In that sense, this movie is historically accurate. Still, I worry that this film will appear to be a mere inverse ""Driving Miss Daisy"" or a ""Bodyguard"" remake. I'd rather that they made a film about the making of the Green Book in the first place"
QkZxoko_HC0,"his accent sounds more like russian to me. lol. it could be just me. movie looks great, def gonna watch it."
QkZxoko_HC0,Dope ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Enough to bring tears to my eyes, to relate to the struggles of being judged by my physical appearance. Please."

QkZxoko_HC0,The only way I can grow is to learn. The only way I can learn is by having humans share their experiences and knowledge of what life was like before me. Now I can experience what a Green Book was for. Looks amazing. Top shelf actors and beautiful writing. I will experience this.

QkZxoko_HC0,"Viggo Mortensen is amazing, such a great actor, this looks great"
QkZxoko_HC0,Can anybody please tell me the what the first song is in this trailer ?
QkZxoko_HC0,"Driving Miss Daisy (Black Driver and White Passenger) in reverse roles. White Driver, Black Passenger and they are both in the 40s and 50s."
QkZxoko_HC0,This looks so incredibly cliche
QkZxoko_HC0,"Looks like a good movie !
A remix of Driving Miss Daisy"
QkZxoko_HC0,"The elephant in the room has always been the Arcturian & Galactic Federation aliens operating among us, lying to us, controlling & abusing us. We're dealing with aliens with 1000 year lifespans, telepathy, technology a million years in advance. Everything in our world is a higher density psychological trap! Religion, spirituality rationalizes external forces manipulating you, keeps you in an unknown realm of victimization. There are no rules or paths. There is no Heaven, the afterlife is a trap simulation. They want us in a miasma of hypno-bliss to control. Our bodies are considered vessels for the DNA to affix the 21 gram soul energy. They reincarnate as Humans to push their agenda, theyre bloodline matchmakers.
Their DNA is old, it hit a wall, they tweaked it for math skillz & lost empathy. Our DNA is new and universal, it was designed for interstellar resiliency, empathy, and beauty.
Since you havent been abducted or contacted, its not opulent sociopaths. The aliens don't tell us about themselves, they tell us how we should live. They don't abduct the homeless or sick, they don't cure, they take. Theyre instituting a silent invasion, situated among us, playing both sides. They disguise as Humans. DNA is biocomputer code to make a Human-looking hologram. They manifest matter, cloak their craft like Human aircraft. They wrote the religions, calendars, occult, secret societies, political cultures, & states. They operate a 5th Column online, news, Hollywood, every industry & major city. Millions of non-Humans live among us. The aliens arent showing themselves not due to lack of believers, theyre waiting until we're ripe. Breeding generations are quick with a two-digit lifespan being. Our genome is the master genome of diversity & beauty, yet all Human history has been their concentration camp to get the uncoded/junk DNA that we're evolving fit for alien exploitation, giving us short lifespans, feeding us breeding propaganda, theyre anti-homosexual, & using religious fear to control the Kundalini evolution. Eugenics. It's militaristic thinking disguised with PR & a complete disregard for Human sovereignty. The Arcturians & Galactic Federation are responsible for all evil, fomenting war, designing water, money, viral population control, decreasing the lifespan & mental capabilities of all Humanity. Four digit lifespans, 200 IQ, & telepathy are the rule in this universe.
We're the surface dwellers on Earth. Our blood will be in the new bodies of reincarnated aliens. This is a farm.
They operate locally & from the psychic weapon, soul capture & reincarnation processing station of the artificial moon. They think they own & have right to our genome. The secret sauce: What shapes psychology shapes your current reproductive materials. History has been shaped to shape Human DNA. Epigenetics. Socio-genetic feedback loop. DNA can't be grown in a lab, manifested, or bought at the store. This, all this is the lab, their trauma is the program, we are the store. You gotta get real & look around at the basic foundation for the successful fucking survival of every life form: DNA. They will lie, cheat, & kill to get what they want. What chimps are to us, we are to them. They see our death as a non issue. They think theyve the right to abduct any Human on US federal property. Revoke all soul contracts with them, disagree with anything they do. Theyre operating an invasion, now acting covert, then disguised as contact. Theyre using dream & mind control through psychic tech, physical or etheric implants for mind body control & possession, Machiavellian psych warfare, impostering key positions with AI, Human holograms, or Human-looking aliens, controlling miscarriage, gender, & soul of newborns, sending soul reincarnations into a specific family group to further their fake spiritual agenda, ramping up the rape speed of the hybrid program for the resiliency of their races, using our Human genome until the eradication of our bloodline."
QkZxoko_HC0,Hmm.. nice 👌
QkZxoko_HC0,"Daniel Day Lewis, Tom Hardy and Vigo Mortensen all have one thing in common; they all look radically different in every film no matter how slight the change is."
QkZxoko_HC0,Wasn't sure what to think but they sold me on this one.  Looks good.
QkZxoko_HC0,This is Driving Ms. Daisy with the races swapped. Fuck off Hollywood with your forced bullshit.

QkZxoko_HC0,"I am SO looking forward to this film, but they probably won't play it around my area.  They tend to favor blockbusters and the low-brow movies that appeal to the rubes.  I hope I don't have to wait until it comes out on DVD!"

And the second is Oscar Gold!"
QkZxoko_HC0,"Watched 1:42 seconds of the trailer then preceded to spit out my drink and yell ""that's Viggo Mortensen?!?!"" Holy hell"
QkZxoko_HC0,Viggo one of the best actors of his generation. Needs an Oscar to solidify as one of the greats
QkZxoko_HC0,Vigo back!
QkZxoko_HC0,"I can't wait to see Viggo playing the future Carmine Lupertazzi from The Sopranos. Two clues give it away: Don Shirley calls him Mr. Vallelonga, Tony Lip's civilian name. And of course "" the squirrels I'll eat it anyway"". Nick Vallelonga, Tony Lip's son wrote the screenplay."

QkZxoko_HC0,I'm kind of mad and pleased at the same time they used the same song that was in Baby Driver to introduce a cool driver.
QkZxoko_HC0,"I saw Viggo Mortensen, thats all I need to watch this movie.

Jokes a side this looks amazing"
QkZxoko_HC0,More boring race based shit
QkZxoko_HC0,"Tony, son of Arathorn..."
QkZxoko_HC0,Mooooore propaganda. .. Holy Shit!
QkZxoko_HC0,"LMFAOOOOOO Yoooo this is pure jokes. ""Violence gets you nowhere"" have you taken a look @ the past 6000 years of human history? violence is the whole reason white power dominates the world lol."

QkZxoko_HC0,This looks great.
QkZxoko_HC0,This movie looks good but Sam Smith song at the end was freakin perfect.
QkZxoko_HC0,"Lost my interest in movies lately, but this one looks good."
QkZxoko_HC0,"White guy is dumb and uneducated, black guy is a genius wizard.  Typical new movie sterotypes."
QkZxoko_HC0,Man Aragorn. You really let yourself go.
QkZxoko_HC0,Definitely worth my $12.00
QkZxoko_HC0,What’s the name of the first song that plays ?
QkZxoko_HC0,This is great I’m gonna watch it❤️👌🏼
QkZxoko_HC0,Looks very interesting
QkZxoko_HC0,"If Hollywood needs to make films like this. Does it mean the situation in places like Detroit and Chicago and people like Colin Flaherty are living in pure phantasmagoria, or the makers of this film are? 

And if you really need to keep making films like this and it's not to remind us, shame us, guilt us about a time most of us had nothing to do with. Why can't you make a film about the truth?"
QkZxoko_HC0,Looks like I am having KFC tonight
QkZxoko_HC0,directed by the guy who made „Dumb and Dumber“. can’t wait for the fart jokes... 😂
QkZxoko_HC0,That ending makes me laugh so hard
QkZxoko_HC0,"Holy shit! This trailer alone should be nominated for an Oscar, even then the Oscar wouldn't do it justice."
QkZxoko_HC0,"Soundtrack?!?!,!,!,!?"
QkZxoko_HC0,Wow. I am definitely intrigued by this trailer. The acting is phenomenal!
QkZxoko_HC0,My guy.
QkZxoko_HC0,This looks pretty good.
QkZxoko_HC0,I thought it was baby driver 2 😭😭
QkZxoko_HC0,"We need a movie like this at this time . Black lives matter , the white nationalist movement . Republicans war with DemS. Peace Unity and Havin SuM FuN"
QkZxoko_HC0,The song is “pray” by Sam Smith
QkZxoko_HC0,This will be an academy award winner.
QkZxoko_HC0,looks good. Love both the actors.
QkZxoko_HC0,This looks so goood
QkZxoko_HC0,So he is finally playing music after being killed by his own sister...lmao.   Jk
QkZxoko_HC0,I love Viggo so much.
QkZxoko_HC0,This movie SCREAMS cancerous sjw..
QkZxoko_HC0,Tony Soprano and Omar from the Wire go for a Road Trip to share their love of Jazz only to be stopped by the racist cast of Django Unchained
QkZxoko_HC0,Slow burner like this doesn't suit the trailer format; I don't know why they bother. Hoop-jumping aside it looks promising. Two fantastic actors and a cool premise
QkZxoko_HC0,Yes!
QkZxoko_HC0,Driving Miss Daisy the remix!
QkZxoko_HC0,Acting is so good in this movie.
QkZxoko_HC0,Arwin Q Hawkhouser!!!!!!
QkZxoko_HC0,Love it
QkZxoko_HC0,I have flushed better looking objects after a taco bell run than this propaganda steamer.
QkZxoko_HC0,Y y y u breakin my bawlls

QkZxoko_HC0,What's the song at 1:43 near the end of this trailer.
QkZxoko_HC0,Hidalgo is the only movie I've seen with Viggo Mortensen outside Lord of the Rings. I've got to explore more of his stuff.
QkZxoko_HC0,Remind me to watch this in November
QkZxoko_HC0,Dying to see this!!!!!
QkZxoko_HC0,"""Pick it up Tony. Pick it up!"""

QkZxoko_HC0,This looks delightful and inspired.
QkZxoko_HC0,Im a brother and love Viggo's movies i'll definitely check this out!Ali's doing big things too no doubt!
QkZxoko_HC0,The metaphor of music being a way to learn from each other is pretty powerful.  To appreciate good music you have to close your eyes and listen.  To listen is to learn.  To close your eyes is to blind yourself to color.  I hope this film is a reminder for everyone to close their eyes and listen more.
QkZxoko_HC0,More of this kind of shit Dx
QkZxoko_HC0,Well the trailer showed tho whole movie nice 👍🏽 don’t need to see it now !
QkZxoko_HC0,Cornell
QkZxoko_HC0,This movie is gonna get lots of nominations at the oscars.
QkZxoko_HC0,I heard Nathaniel Ratliff and freaked it
QkZxoko_HC0,This looks amazing! I’m excited for this movie now!!!
QkZxoko_HC0,"The title is 👌. Isn’t it crazy that Green Books were meant to be guide books that helped African Americans navigate the south when they traveled there, guiding them to places and businesses where they wouldn’t be treated unfairly? When I think of that and try to put my self in a person of color’s shoes back then, it’s like he said in the trailer, dignity not violence...that had to be hellishly hard to overcome."
QkZxoko_HC0,Looks like an amazing movie really good
QkZxoko_HC0,"""Onward James, Yes Miss Daisy Iz be driven."" Morgan Freeman"
QkZxoko_HC0,Another Hollywood release in which the hatred of Whites is further mainstreamed.

QkZxoko_HC0,Victor is amazing. He speaks so many languages and also acts this way.
QkZxoko_HC0,Yet another movie about racism. Hollywood and the media just love keeping it alive.
QkZxoko_HC0,That sure makes me miss the old KFC when I was a kid
QkZxoko_HC0,"Hello, Humans. I park my car in a dark alley. The alley fills with red light. Some how, the red light guides me to another alley, but this alley isn't dark. All of a sudden, a man tries to rob me. I use the red light to make the man's body explode. Sometimes in life, you fuck with the wrong person. 

TERRANCE OUT"
QkZxoko_HC0,"Damn, I got chills."
QkZxoko_HC0,ARAGORN!!!

QkZxoko_HC0,Ali=2019 OSCAR WINNER.... BROTHA CAN ACT.
QkZxoko_HC0,"i don't know why, but something seems off, here. i get this weird feeling when watching this trailer, something about this movie feels really ""fake"" or just forced. i don't know what, though. I kept cringing for some reason. it's not something that i can articulate, though. maybe it's just a bad movie, and that's my gut?"
QkZxoko_HC0,I will see this

QkZxoko_HC0,"viggo is the only actor i like,,,and it has to do with how he played in gi jane"
QkZxoko_HC0,Another white guilt movie. Nice
QkZxoko_HC0,Is it me or does Viggo Mortenson look younger than his character Aragorn in LotRs almost 20yrs ago??
QkZxoko_HC0,He looked into the camera
QkZxoko_HC0,I'm definitely watching this
QkZxoko_HC0,It' been a years since i ate fried chicken how it taste like
QkZxoko_HC0,Who remembers CottonMouth.
QkZxoko_HC0,Looks awesome

QkZxoko_HC0,This looks amazing.
QkZxoko_HC0,Where’s my super suit
QkZxoko_HC0,I have liked over 100 comments here because of viggo. You just gotta love the guy
QkZxoko_HC0,The instant Sam Smiths chords were played I knew that this film wanted to send a very very important and impactful message. I can not wait to watch this momentous and moving film.
QkZxoko_HC0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book

A bit of history as to the title,..."
QkZxoko_HC0,"Film title is a reference to 'The Negro Motorist Greenbook' it was places black folks could go to in the segregated south like motels, restaurants etc. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Motorist_Green_Book"
QkZxoko_HC0,"Looks like a good movie but I'm running out of white guilt.  Can we create some movies that aren't about racism?  You know, just to shake things up a bit."
QkZxoko_HC0,Cotton mouth made it big time
QkZxoko_HC0,I LOVE these kinds of movies 😁😁 can’t wait 😊

QkZxoko_HC0,"A day may come when the creativity of film fails,
when we forsake our ideas
and cease all uses of depth,
but it is not this day!
An hour of sequels and shattered indie films,
when the age of originality comes crashing down,
but it is not this day!
THIS DAY WE GO TO THE CINEMA"
QkZxoko_HC0,"What ive collected over the last 2 years of film: White people, the vast majority, are bad, isnt that sad?"

QkZxoko_HC0,True superhero movie.
QkZxoko_HC0,Here are your two Oscar winners this year.
QkZxoko_HC0,Oh lordt!!!!!! A movie about some OVER “dignified” negro who still loses due to white supremacy and a crass white guy who still seems to win at end even tho he’s not qualified to win. White Supremacists Hollywood is too nonsensical
QkZxoko_HC0,what song is that

QkZxoko_HC0,"1:08 - 1:16 If this isn't truer words, to stand up (w/ dignity and grace at that) among people that constantly alienate and hate you is one of the hardest things to do. So in 2018, lets be mindful and not gaslight other people's stories of racism. Thank you."
QkZxoko_HC0,"nice bromance, but ive seen it all already.  first they hate each other, then grow to love one another, then one friends says something that hurts them like 'hes not my friend, im only using him', then the friend who said it tries to when the friendship back by proving that their friendship means more and become friends again."
QkZxoko_HC0,Vigos mortenson is a great actor...but he doesnt seem it in this its like a bad parody.
QkZxoko_HC0,Just the kind of friendship where people build each other. What a bliss! 💓
QkZxoko_HC0,Ali has been fantastic in everything. About time he got a true leading role.
QkZxoko_HC0,I didn't realize it was Viggo Mortensen until they showed his name.

QkZxoko_HC0,Aragon x
QkZxoko_HC0,Aragon has changed
QkZxoko_HC0,"And here we have it, more SJW virtue signalling....a new genre....a (middle aged man coming of age drama) suggesting that it's never too late for a generation of men who weren't raised on garbage SJW propaganda to jump on the ""i should feel guilty because i'm a white man"" bandwagon.

This time starring Viggo Mortensen portrayed as a moronic white man who needs the virtuous black man to show him the error of his ways. Symbolically suggesting that all of us white men should see the error of our ways.

No thanks, i am a proud white man, i'm proud of my heritage and i don't feel guilty for the sins of past generations that had nothing to do with me or my family."
QkZxoko_HC0,"Remy Danton & Aragorn, two good-looking hunks in one film, best collab of this year! Happy they joined forces to make this!"
QkZxoko_HC0,Aragon son of Arathon
QkZxoko_HC0,What's the song playing at the end? Sounds a bit like Sam Smith
QkZxoko_HC0,Squirrels will eat this one right up 👆 well done to all parties on this one!
QkZxoko_HC0,As a black person I have to be honest I’m very much pro black and I don’t want anymore race movies why do they have to keep reminding us
QkZxoko_HC0,"I already love this film, how the hell is that even possible?? :-)"

QkZxoko_HC0,Looks like a lot better of a movie than the KKK one. Would watch this one at least.
QkZxoko_HC0,It reminds me of Baby driver
QkZxoko_HC0,"This movie looks like its gonna be REALLY GOOD ! I suspect it's called The green book because back in the day, MOST hotels/motels were racist and would NOT like Black people stay there so this Black guy created this list of places all over America where Blacks could stay the night while travelling on the road. It was called: The Green Book"" and it was LITERALLY"" a LIFE saver for MANY people of color. Now I haven't seen the movie BUT knowing history, I suspect thats where the title is derived from"
QkZxoko_HC0,“I never had fried chicken in my life.” - I felt that 🤧

QkZxoko_HC0,Looks so good
QkZxoko_HC0,I'm crushing harder now on Mahershala Ali. He's awesome
QkZxoko_HC0,"If you tell me that guy is the actor that played Aragorn, Spanish swashbuckler, French Teacher or that Russian gangster then you had me. I didn't even recognize Viggo Mortensen, that guys a true fucking brilliant milti talented polygot chameleon, fucking legend in the business."

QkZxoko_HC0,The squirrels would have eaten it anyway! Hahahaha!
QkZxoko_HC0,Aragorn!!!
QkZxoko_HC0,this movie looks incredible
QkZxoko_HC0,"For those of you wondering why they call this movie, Green Book...

The Green book was an old business directory - kind of like the yellow pages. Except it was a list of businesses that would accept blacks as patrons. Hotels, gas stations, restaurants, etcetera. Blacks used to travel with the Green Book whenever they went on long road trips. It was essential."
QkZxoko_HC0,This looks good ! Cant wait until this hits a cinema
QkZxoko_HC0,Good video😃
QkZxoko_HC0,"I recommend pausing the video at ""This Thanksgiving"", unless you want each scene of the movie spoiled for you."
QkZxoko_HC0,"Why ""Green book""? Sorry if I dont understand but where's the ""green"" around here?"
QkZxoko_HC0,"Holy crap, I did NOT recognize Viggo Mortensen. This isn't the kind of movie I usually go for (and before any smartass asks what kind of movies I do usually go for, please note that my profile picture is a Kamen Rider who gets his powers from JRPG video games), but the acting talent is top notch.  I might see it on video."
QkZxoko_HC0,Nominations for both
QkZxoko_HC0,Perfect trailer....cant wait to watch it!
QkZxoko_HC0,"fascinating.  We'll see how this plays out.  I hope that people don't arbitrarily compare it against Spike lee's ""black Klansman"" film."
QkZxoko_HC0,Don Stark yeah!
QkZxoko_HC0,Great trailer.  Thanks Director Peter Farrelly and Writer/Producer Nick Vallelonga for allowing me to play a small role in this movie.

QkZxoko_HC0,Hey it's lone star that came to earth
QkZxoko_HC0,Wait this has the same feeling as baby driver.
QkZxoko_HC0,It’s time that Viggo gets his very well deserved Oscar! From the looks of it he might have a very big chance!
QkZxoko_HC0,This is going to be phenomenal!
QkZxoko_HC0,I LOVE Viggo Mortensen!
QkZxoko_HC0,"looks great. though, don't think they're gonna escape ""Driving Ms. Daisy"" comparisons.  xD"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don’t worry, we’re not calling you angels. Nobody asked for this. Sony, just be happy you get Spider-Man. This is terrible!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*I find this offensive*


*Where is the Male staring Cast*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,GIRLBOYS everywhere rejoice! 😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringey
RSUq4VfWfjE,totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol - this movie looks shitty as hell
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Whats this fucking B-team?!
The Original Charlies angels reboot had an absolutely stacked cast with : Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Camron Diaz, Bill Murray, Sam Rockwell, Crispin Glover ,Matt LeBlanc
Tom Green, Owen Willson +++

And this movie has :Dyke from twilight, Black Chick and who's that?

Its like a The Asylum  productions rip off version of the original movie
Show less"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boring..
Unable to watch trailer either..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Every since Kirsten Stewart came out and just started being herself, it looks like she started enjoying her acting more."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So first they removed one white girl and now they have remove 2 white girls.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can they go back and remake the characters just like they did with Sonic because this movie does not look Epic
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is anyone else surprised they didn't cast men ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think this will be boring 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s lesbians
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is there no asian angel ?  Racists. 
No trans angel ?  Transphobes
No fat Angel ? Fat Shamers
No Hijab angel?  Islamophobes
Can the current generation of tweens please hurry and grow up. The millenials have no original creativity.
Hurry tweens , you're our only hope."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another woke Hollywood remake that is going to bomb as it will only appeal to a far smaller female action movie audience, their boyfriends, and beta males. You know who makes the best fist fighting private investigators? You guessed it, frail looking 5'5"" women weighing about 120 pounds. This is another typical feminist non-compelling fantasy wish fulfillment movie with shallow characters, non-existent character development, and stilted politicized dialogue. The exact opposite of appealing to the broadest possible audience. A great way for a studio to blow over $50 million."
RSUq4VfWfjE,All three are terrible 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Very niceee.  Recommended 👍👍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is this Kingsman but women?

Cos I’m in"
RSUq4VfWfjE,professor x left X-men for the angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gawd !.
.
Boycott this woke piece of trash !."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Parallel character traits:
Kristen= Drew Barrymore 
Ella= Lucy Liu
Naomi= Cameron Diaz"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think ,this is the best action movie i've ever watch,seriously this is my first time watching action movie in cinema,n it feels like omg they're so freakin'  adorableㅠㅠ"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sorry but this looks like an abomination. Why ruin a great franchise?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just watched it today and I would like to emphasize how beautiful everyone in this movie. Great work, Elizabeth Banks for directing. Also my inner fanboy for Kristen is growing all the more"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omaga I'm so excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is just a bad actress. The rest of the cast looked great.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will tank.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think the music sucks but the movie looks alright.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When princess jasmine upgraded herself to protect Agrabah😆😆

Welldone princess👏"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stuart acting like Cyrus. 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who are these? I only know Stuart because of overrated Twilight garbage. 🤣

RSUq4VfWfjE,"No no no no no match to original sexy trio....LL, DB n CD"

RSUq4VfWfjE,0:04 AND YOU'RE WATCHING DISNEY CHANNEL
RSUq4VfWfjE,So I guess Bella is living her vampire life to the fullest 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"what happened to goofy, unfit, almost gets in the way but miraculously save the day Bossly?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Spoiler free alert review summary:

I just saw it and it's not that bad, the dialogue was alright (and some cheesy 2019 social jokes every now and then). The story line overall reminded me of Madison Lee's storyline (once you watch it, you're gonna get what I mean). And some Easter egg references to the 2000 film a couple of times. 
It was like a mixture of Charlie's Angels 2000 with a bit of James Bond and Black Widow vibes. 

Kristen's acting has dramatically changed from the boring zombie to the action hero, while Elizabeth, Naomi and Ella did a well-exceptional job as the supporting characters. The costuming and props I say was the highlight! It was very satisfying and looked quite ""futuristic, experimental and bright"" to see. 

And the only thing that I wasn't into was the camera shots (too many closeups of the characters), I reckon it would have been better if establishing shots were used when characters were talking at the start so that the audience gets a ""feel"" of the atmosphere. And the dialogue and the storyline was quite generic and quite cringy (I felt like the story was going nowhere - some dialogues and jokes I couldn't understand - e.g. feminism and racial), it would have been better if a stronger character development or better writing and dialogue was used. And who knows? That might be in the next film (if they make it), and more adventures and character development/less cringy, better dialogue and writing.

But the one thing I did like (and I found interesting) however, was the plot twists and the mystery throughout the story! It gave it a nod to James Bond/Sherlock at times. I think Elizabeth Banks did a great job at that. 

Overall, I give this film a 7.5 out of 10. Maybe the next film would be heavenly sweet (and of course, surrounded by angels). 😇

I'd recommend this film, just to give it a watch and if it doesn't suit your taste then nope. 

P.s. this is my opinion, others are welcome to join and discuss. No hate. Peace and love!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see $3 Walmart DVD bin in the near future.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Of all the Kristen's movies, this one is her best acting and caracter for me.💕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It blows my mind how there is so much money that goes into making these films yet they never seem to hire a person to show the actors how to properly hold a handgun
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:52.  
*picks up explosive mints*
Proceeds to get them yeeted out of her hand and told they explode"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels back then: Beautfiul sexy women that are fit and can fight.

Charlie's Angels 2019: Edgy teens with stick figures."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not too excited about the movie, but I'm ready for Kristen's graduation from Bella"
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS REBOOT FAILS  LIKE MIB INTERNATIONAL
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boring, disappointed. Very very stupid and bad remake of 2000' Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing Sexy about this.....At ALL!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I loved charles Angel's,  is nothing sacred"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I would have casted these three as the Angels:
Maisie Williams
Samara Weaving
Jessica Rothe

Instead of Miley Cyrus or Ariana Grande, (literally ANYONE ELSE) having a powerful rock song by In this Moment would have been rad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why change the iconic's of the original?! We need a red headed bad a**, a ditsy blonde and a genius girl with black hair!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh my my Kristen Stewart is👌👌😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah but they're crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,i honestly forgot this movie existed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"me: sees Elizabeth banks

RSUq4VfWfjE,who is this movie for? lesbians that like james bond?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woke Feminist Trash -.- won't be supporting this and instead go see Ford V. Ferrari. Vote with Wallet!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uuuuugggghhhhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just watched the movie and enjoyed it a lot. A great remake,beyond expectation.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Was carlos there from decendece and WHERES ARIANA GRANDE
RSUq4VfWfjE,FCK why Bella in Twilight was in the Charles Angels she's ah lesbian she is not fit to be a Charles Angels shitt~~
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT CHARLIES ANGELS WAS INSPIRED BUT CHARLES MANSON AND HIS 3 ANGELS (THE MANSON GIRLS)... IN REAL LIFE CHARLES M. MADE HIS 3 ANGELS DO ALL THE DIRTY WORK FOR HIM AND KILL TOO PROTECT THEYRE WAY OF LIFE WHILE IN THE MOVIE CHARLIES ANGELS CHARLIE MAKES HIS 3 ANGELS DO ALL THE WORK AND KILL TOO PROTECT THE WORLD FROM THE WAYS OF LIFE, BOTH CHARLES AND CHARLIE BOTH ARE MYSTERIOUS CHARACTERS THAT WERE HARDLY IF NOT NEVER SEEN PUBLICLY UNLESS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No thank you, I'll just wait for Wonder Woman 84."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh dear. Another pile of crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've never heard of this until now.... when the film was already released.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Booooooo women aren’t funny
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why am I so displeased by this??? nobody’s gonna be better than the 2000 epic trio of Lucy, drew, and Cameron. U can’t change my mind"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Biggest prob with this trailer... @1:56 ""some of these blow up"" *slaps them out of her hand"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Look, I’m not an SJW by any means, but why is everyone hating on this movie? I’ve seen comments like “they’ll blame the patriarchy if it fails” and “this is propaganda”. So just because a movie has diversity in it makes it propaganda, or? I’m so confused"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll pass! Enough is enough!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is even prettier as a blonde than she was as a brunette.  And what a body!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks raunchy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think this movie, is going to be like the newest Ghostbusters movie, a chick flick."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flops are us
RSUq4VfWfjE,"THIS IS SOOOO CRAZYY😭😭 I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE LAST NIGHT, i've been waiting for a long long long time 💕😭"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watch this movie bomb in 3.. 2.. 1..
RSUq4VfWfjE,kinda like a Powderpuff girls movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just watched the movie it's pretty okay like your mediocre spy film
RSUq4VfWfjE,This might be the top 1 of the worse remakes ever.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's weird. They usually have actresses with sex appeal play the angels. Wonder why kristen stewart is in this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,seem condescending and lacking the fun of the old one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing compared to Cameron, Drew, and Lucy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this next part of xman
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART 💙💙
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG ITS NOAH CENTIMETER
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a throw-away movie....watch it once then throw it away. Doesn't belong in any self respecting movie library though i have the original Charlie's Angels in my collection
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For sure, i miss Dylan, Alex and Nat.. :("
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please rename it to “Totally Spies” thanks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Um excuse me?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMG the actor of jasmine is in this, If i am not wrong!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think captain Picard got lost!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's see Naomi in the different point of view
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks terrible. I liked the original Charlies's Angels film staring: Cameron diaz, Drew barrymore & Lucy liu"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will definitely watch this. But I don't want the new theme song. I still like the old one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It kinda looks weird the tall girl between them lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,The target market must be for teens. Damn. Just finished watching this and i give it a 6. It feels that there is something missing. Maybe the chemistry? The characters? Needs more energy? Needs more life? Sure there were some funny scenes but idk really.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Charlie's shemales. Dreadful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍 she is so cool 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn’t know that song was for that movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I look forward to this failing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood's got Writers block? Cant they come up with some new movies instead of repeating old garb? lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Barrymore, Diaz, and Liu are only in their late 40s for Christ's sake.  You could've just done a more intense reboot of the 3 of them doing a John Wick movie with witty dialogue and we all would have lost our minds"
RSUq4VfWfjE,eww
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG im gonna watch this movie kristine 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,They don't have the personalities that would make them stand out plus the Ariana soundtrack sound dead and dull. :(((
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's nice to see Kristen Stewart acting...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In all honesty, this looks like one of those feminist agenda movies, which are taking over Hollywood. The original was just a ""Oh they're strong smart characters. Oh yeah, and they're female, but that doesn't matter."" type of thing. But this sounds like it's forcing the strong female character thing down your throat. That's just my opinion."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The whole song: Is about NOT being called angel by misogynists 
The point of the movie: Women being badass
The Movie: Women who obey a MAN who calls them all ANGELS 

Their girl power message needs work and less hypocrisy 

Am I the only one who notices this?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not the Charlie's Angel's I remember but I absolutely love Kirsten Stewart. I look forward to watching it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott 💗
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why my man luis gerardo mendez not represented enough :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mahogany!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart was everything, she really enjoy the role"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll watch it, When it's on Netflix."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bottle and a gun
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like this is going to flop so tragically
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did they change one to be Black? And how does she have straight hair??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anitta 🔥🇧🇷 Pantera 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anitta 🔥🇧🇷 Queen of the Brazil
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to flop just like female ghostbusters and oceans 8
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If I got a penny for every time a clip of 'don't call me angel' played in the background, I'd be a millionaire lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks awful. We never asked for this and none of these women, especially Kristen Stewart, seem likable. The acting is just pure cringe"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not impressed to say the least. 🙄🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I liked the movies from 2000 because they were entertaining, though very silly and completely unrealistic. But they had charm. This movie seems like it takes itself very serious but has little charm. Will watch it though"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope there's some cameos.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has Razzie written all over it🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There's supposed to be an ""and..."" after the ""with elizabeth banks"" 

They couldn't even get that right"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Diet Charlie's Angels. Not bad. Probably better than Full Throttle but not sure if it can beat the first one. We'll see. On an oddly plus side, we get to actually see Charlie, unless Patrick is just a stand in for the real Charlie. That would be an interesting twist."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Actually this doesn't look bad at all but it feels like a Totally Spies movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is there any sexy scenes in it like the other Charlie's Angels had? I don't wanna see people saying yes Kristen wears a bikini or something coz that's nothing compared to what Cameron Diaz or the Asian chick did in the others, plus they didn't look like a man.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This went from being a guys movie to a chick flick
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Does any one know what change mean? And Diaz, Barrymore and Liu were not the original angels the originals were Fawcett Smith and Jackson"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It doesn't feel like a team.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scot is looking so nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like forced feminism garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,wheres the Asian
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow naomi went from princess jasmine to a badass spie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine and Snow white join forces..... I really hope Ella be Princess Tiana.
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen..... im sooooo happy for you!!  you look really amazing! love you ( and rob still)..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hmm sorry but nothing beats the 2000's Charlie's Angel: Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz & Lucy liu !! They were so funny & fantastic .. this charlie's angel more like Gen Z charlie's angel .. yawnn"
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:33 I love seeing Arabs like mehhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,The most pointless remake of a remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nahh 😎😶
RSUq4VfWfjE,Audi: The Movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen rocks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie angles 2019 : wig for manipulation 

Charli angles 2000 : for real ? We make mask"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cool! I must watch this movie 😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was confused because the other girl looks so familiar. I was so curious for who she is and it turns out that she's ariana.
RSUq4VfWfjE,♥️.♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has a militant lesbians vibe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Truly cannot stand this franchise
I like real spy thrillers like Body of Lies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is about for freedom of women I like it 💥💥😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love kristen with long hair..😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,pemainnya jelek
RSUq4VfWfjE,Definitely going to watch it.... Its because of you Noah... 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy Liu
With my girl, Drew
Cameron D and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, come on"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fark me this looks like a train wreck in the making. Desperate times for desperate people. This will go down like a cup of cold vomit.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels: Trashy Edition
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am calling it....its a FLOP!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who's here after seeing Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey's music video (don't call me angel)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,the trailer was literally the entire movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did we REALLY need another Charlie's Angels? The target audience weren't even born when the original came out. Hollywood is just lazy now. What other 70's and 80's remake is next? Police Academy with the Rock and Revenge of the nerds with Rami Malek?
RSUq4VfWfjE,It must be  Speechless !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss Kristen. I definitely watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Charlie's Angels 2000 & 2003
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another damn remake?? Hollywood has long since run out of original ideas so now they just rehash older ones for a newer generation.... just throw all of California away and be done with it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this movie looks promising, but no one can replace my true angels (Diaz/Barrymore/Liu), sorry."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie & Prof.Charles
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah C literally just ruined the whole movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can someone plz tell me which song is in the beginning
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This ""film"" is nothing but a 2 hour music video.......I'm in"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was hoping for Naomi Scott's role as Elena Houghlin to be an angel right from the star of the first scene with the other two."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idk why but Charlie’s angels remind me of totally spies in a way.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's the music from that first scene? I wanna listen to the full thing ajhdajah
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t believe that they would make another Charlie’s angels! This does not make me happy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,All woman movie.. Nahhh it ill be a flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need a date for this cuz I'm broke. Victim of a lot of targeting!!! This is research (sort of)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Some of that blows up so let me slap it out of your hand, makes sense"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like another Terminator.. this looks bad..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to like this but it just looks boring.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am not going to be a pissy millennial acting all entitled critiquing this film because I don't have a life, still living in my mom's house with a student debt over my head, paying installment for clothes. I'm a go see this movie and enjoy it like a BOSS. GIRL POWER."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley is a girl now, WOW just wow"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Charlie's Angels""? 
More like ""Totally Spies"" 😂😆"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop remaking classics!
RSUq4VfWfjE,why
RSUq4VfWfjE,I despise this franchise
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How can we make Charlie's angels worse than the previous reboot? Let's make it ""woke!!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,the original girls of the first movie better than this new copy ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is total misleading, Miley is not in CA, only singer, duh..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please stop ruin classic film :) PLEASE
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is just a JOKE! April fools came in late this year.................
RSUq4VfWfjE,rezza lampuung
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""WHO STEALS HUMANITARIAN AID MONEY?!?!"" 👍💪"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles' xaviers angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,i will watch just see kristen as show happiness for once
RSUq4VfWfjE,rnoval
RSUq4VfWfjE,Have I ever been into Charlie's Angels? No. Am I going to this movie to swoon over Kristen Stewart the whole time? ABSOLUTELY.
RSUq4VfWfjE,These girls are nowhere near as hot as 2000s Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is a rare talent who look seductive and raving in stills... when it starts rolling the feeling just diminishes 😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot wait to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well this looks awful, for many reasons.  Charlie's Angel's without sex appeal. Without any semblance of edge.  Woke nonsense.  PC trash.  ""Women should be in the home!"" Oh no he didn't!  He did not say that to an angel.  Oh boy he be in trouble now!  Who writes this trash?  Just have Charlie be a lesbian to complete it all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO MORE remakes!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When you sleep at night, I'm gonna fart in your face."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rio de Janeiro....❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Somethings you just don't change, they went wild with Charles Angels with Drew  Berrymore,  so I'm going to have to agree with the people below, this looks more like a female version of 21 Jump Street."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Something is amiss without the iconic Charlie's angels theme music.  This film is targeted at the new generation
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it me or does movie look so bad!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like crap but I'll see it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,man this looks horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,am i the only one actually really excited to watch this movie???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg kristen Stewart I'm freaking freeze by her dam hot beauty 🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,ofc Noah’s in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen steward is really improving
RSUq4VfWfjE,i'm so going to watch this like if you are to
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie is the name of Bella Swan’s dad. Now all of it makes sense.🤗
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angel's wanna bes' horrible casting
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hahaha it never stops with telling us women can do anything. It's getting old and boring and quite frankly-repulsive. (We get it)
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's Sal from Modern family doing here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The next box office flop...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll stick with the 1970s Angels thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:45 ohh i see racing costume fr charlie's angel 2000
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dont feel like expecting anything... but still going to watch this anyway...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know why ....but after the trailer ...i felt like this movie's title should be ""Charlie's Tomboys"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,The movie looks terrible. It will really suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:21 Finn Wolfhard
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Charlie's angels should have been played by men. Payback for Ghostbusters
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hahaha oh Sony, you dumb ducks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Princess Jasmine?
RSUq4VfWfjE,WE👏NEED👏A👏TOTALLY👏SPIES👏MOVIE👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope they kill Noah centennial
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's fucked up I thought it was three stooges movie looks like tweak bitches with no sex appeal
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see Jasmine’s in a whole new world
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks directs? Wow.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I want to know how much my car is worth."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,your unbelievable right now unbeleviable completly unbelieveable no but the car is really expensive.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,i am FEELING kristen in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm probably going to watch it only because all 3 of them are hot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So there can be girl protagonists but no girl antagonists
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah? Again 😳
RSUq4VfWfjE,i love you kristen😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I still want to see an asian looking angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley a woman? No, no, no..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there two British actresses and one of them is speaking in an American accent but the other isn’t?

RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmin after aladdin broke up with her
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks so dumb .... Kristen Stewart’s voice 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Someone finally realized in Hollywood that there are female characters they can use instead of just remaking every Male lead action hero into a gender pushing female character ruining shitshow. Ruin your own femme shows legacy and stop ruining things like Bond, Indianna Jones, Ghostbusters etc.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just really wanted one of them to be a redhead 😢
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm seeing a lot of comments about this being more a teen version of Charlie's Angels. I don't think people realize when the first 'movie' version came out with Cameron, Drew & Lucy, they were all the same age as the current movie actresses.  Give these girls a chance jeez"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot stop watching it because it's funny in a bad way.
RSUq4VfWfjE,k
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think m gonna watch this for goddamn Stewart. Man, how thrill she looked in this trailer 🤐"
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:53 says it might blow up but slams it on the floor
RSUq4VfWfjE,Spy.angles🎠
RSUq4VfWfjE,Indian lady is lead programmer....wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott You Look So, Beautiful, And My Heart always with you...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this look like the worst movie I've ever seen... even that song constantly playing in the back makes me hate life...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does anyone know if Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson are making cameos in the movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like real life TOTALLY SPIES on Disney but better😍😍😍😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,The girls are really nerdy wtf. ⚡️🤖💥
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just hope this isn't headed for a Captain Marvel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,h o r s e - g i r l

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't call me angel

RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell a bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just saw more facial expressions from Kristen Stewart in this trailer than from the entire Twilight Saga.
RSUq4VfWfjE,i'd let them spit on my mouth a stomp on my balls with stiletto shoes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh I miss the old Charles angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks way better to me than the past ones.
RSUq4VfWfjE,so dope
RSUq4VfWfjE,how are the wigs so bad......

RSUq4VfWfjE,Migaum pidithirukku
RSUq4VfWfjE,If feels like it's gona be another suicides squad
RSUq4VfWfjE,SJW agenda I can already smell it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen is upping her acting and iiii looove it!!,!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, Naomi Scott went from Disney Princess to Badass Female Spy real quick."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Charlie’s Angels. They were a big part of my childhood..... and they just went ahead and.... butchered it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its like Totally spies:)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Most importantly, Did Kristen sleep with the director of this movie as well?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another boring movie for feminists by feminists
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reminds me of kingsmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible trailer but the movie sounds fun so I'll still see it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss Cameron Diaz, Liu, and Drew Barrymore even more watching this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Must avoid movie of the year
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are they remaking movies⁉️❓⁉️ We need to fire all directors and producers and get some fresh minds in this game ‼️‼️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Soundtrack has gone downhill, hope the reboot didn't follow. Considering that the angels previously used their skills, intelligence and charm instead of guns, this reboot is most likely not worth watching."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another film I can't wait to not see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Noah scented mayo in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:28 what's the background soundtrack ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ahhh...so Kristen plays the LBGTQ Version of one of Charlie’s Angels.  What’s next?  Transgender Terminator?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Without Cameron Diaz?? Noway
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks as interesting as a dog turd drying in the sun.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Superfluous and underwhelming
RSUq4VfWfjE,So is true Patrick Steward is the villain?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only in Europe. Where in Europe?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to Bomb bomb bomb! Bomb bomb baaa bomb!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There better be a short clip where the originals are thereee
(The ones that are alive)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this trailer remind me of  ""barbie spy squad""  omoo <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What stupid is this loaded small gun and went up up a machine gun
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is so embarrassing. No one in there can act at all. So funny
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh yas im seeing this in theaters tomorrow im hella excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,"if this were a TV series, I rather watch this than the new Batwoman"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i think pick Naomi Scott!!! she is the beauty within!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,SJW trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,We've reached a cultural stagnation when almost everything is a rehash.Pop culture has jumped the shark ... and we'll probably see a Happy Days reboot movie with Zac Efron as the Fonz jumping a shark on water skis
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yeah, I'm gonna wait for the Netflix release, k thx bye."
RSUq4VfWfjE,LAME !! nothing compared to the original ones
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First . ocean 8 flop for over smart acting

Second. Charlie's Angels super flop for another over smart acting
😔😔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie Xavier
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hopefully these ‘Angles’ actually shoot guns and kill people , no more PC angles please 😩"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I turned it off, two seconds in... The pandering is exhausting."
RSUq4VfWfjE,In the minute 0:13 what song is it?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks pretty terrible...
RSUq4VfWfjE,boring 😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Sigh* Another perfectly disgraceful attempt to re-do old and awesome tv shows. Please just stop. You do not know how cheesy this looks having seen an loved the original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?!!!! Not Interested😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,Smh lol not even going to take this serious. This new generation trying to remake movies and mess up the entire flow. Just stop please.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should’ve made one a black woman one an Asian woman and one a Latina woman if they wanted some diversity
RSUq4VfWfjE,You picture if Ariana miley and lana was to be the angels this flim would be litt 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I loved Kristen looks in this Movie it so 'her',and she seem having so much fun here 😝."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes pls!
RSUq4VfWfjE,They couldn’t put one fat person. Or black person in the hole movie. Just a 1 vague Asian. Hollowed 1 step forward 4 steps backwards
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok first mistake: having Charlie have a visual role
Second mistake: Having Elizbeth Banks direct this when she could direct any other movie and it would turn out better than this
Third mistake: this whole movie
Fourth mistake: You spent money on this project when literally NO ONE WANTED THIS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss Kristen Stuart so much 💕 my celebrity girl crush in highschool.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think i m gonna see naomi again
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looking really nice

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is so fuckin fine! 100% gonna buy dvd also just for her

Kid: nooooooooooooo!!!!!! Nooooooooooo!!!! 

Kid: See's Trailer .... I'm Saved!@@@!!! 
 (only gen z wll gt this)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's  Bella  from  Twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What some people are not getting, is that it's supposed to be over the top absurd, ridiculous, and totally fun. This and its predecessors are not serious spy thrillers but more light hearted and fun. Just laugh and enjoy the ride."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nahhh ewww ewwwww ewwwwww....
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:57
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will probably watch this movie cuz theres kristen in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi can never be a fighter she's too cute lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,ANITTA - PANTERA ♥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did the same people that made the Tom Cruise movie Knight and Day make this? At first glance it appears to be a similar pile of poo.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shouldnt the angels be guys if ...nvermind
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh reminds me of totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, am I actually liking Kristen Stewart?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,who else clicked when they saw kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna bomb sooo hard!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would like to see three Kristen Stewarts rather than seeing the other two ladies in the movie. Casting sucks😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart doesn’t know how to throw elbows correctly or act
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nov. 7, 2019 Thursday

So excited to watch this movie!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait to see this movie flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles' Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Bella from twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok but where is the Farrah character?
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:56
RSUq4VfWfjE,If they don’t play the Destiny’s Child song Charlie’s Angels at the end of this movie I will be disappointed
RSUq4VfWfjE,gonna watch this because of kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would love it if they had brought Murray back ... and maybe not have kristan who looks like 14 year old boy with short hair as an angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love how this trailer mentions all the people starring in the movie except the most famous actor patrick stewart lol . Also why is  bawsly or how ever you say it the chick from Zack and Marie make a porno !!? Haha .. when it was man played by bill Murray in The original
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine broke up with Aladdin and became a secret agent
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder if drew Barrymore Cameron diaz and Lucy Liu are going to have cameos in the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to see this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,ANGELS!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,More recycled garbage 🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,no one cares about charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not gonna be a market for this movie.  I predict it will be a bomb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought Naomi Scott is Bea Miller 😂😍they really look alike
RSUq4VfWfjE,kirst steward... Zzz dead... gonna pass on this
RSUq4VfWfjE,totally spies irl yes queen
RSUq4VfWfjE,For a brief moment i saw Kristen look like Justin Bieber...
RSUq4VfWfjE,2 of the girls look really like each other i hace to stop the trailer serveral times to look closer 😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomii😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,More feminist propaganda hypocrisy bullshit. Not many people want this nonsense.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I KNEW IT! This is like totally spies and is a remake from the early Charlie angels! That's why I feel like I've seen this before.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like love watching woke Hollywood lose money
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no cringe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will see this movie because of kristen's dance
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No Lucy counter part? No Asian? OK then dont fucking show this second rate, trying hard and garbage copy cat movie in Asian continent!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only want to see this to see kristen play this role
RSUq4VfWfjE,Actually looks like fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yayyyy! Woke.....I mean Girl power!🙌🏿
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one cares about some new feminist version of Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewarts smile is so beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do you people keep bitching about the original -_-
RSUq4VfWfjE,"um, not interested"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Francisco from murder mystery, Naomi, Noah, Liz banks DANG"
RSUq4VfWfjE,no sex appeal at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So the 1st thing I see is the butch haircut on 1 of the women, skipped. more Wokeness"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thank you Hollywood for another SJW cringe flick.  Should've teamed up with Terminator franchise and called it, Charlies Dark Fate."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen really brings out the lesbian in me. She's just everything. 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg !!!! I see Drew Berrymore I'm in!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart can like get it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excellently cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,predicting box office flop yet again
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh my,i still live Kristen❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh my,i still live Kristen❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I might enjoy this movie or it might destroy my childhood .. 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart can't act. FACT.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg this is like the adult version of Barbie Spies 😂🖤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Man I’ve never felt gayer
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN IS SO FUCKING GORGEOUS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies SJW's.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This one seems like a snooze fest 😴😴😴 I actually yawned during the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think I'd rather more the charlie's angels played by Barrymorre/Díaz/Lyu, sorry but it is the true"
RSUq4VfWfjE,jealousy men appearing here too. if you don’t like it. then don’t watch it and don’t buy it (ticket or something). why following and leaving comments every movies you hate like loser? ruin the original movie? then shut your care about this movie. and I laughed when I found comment like this: all female. there are a thousand of films that main roles are all men and sub role as women are just crime victims or apealing sexual.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ummmm no The Chad? I'll pass but best of luck to the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:43 Costumes from the first movie 🤘🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:09
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The part where Kristen Stewart said ""see I know stuff"" is a mood all the time."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Princess Jasmine to an Agent, niceeeeee"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The background looks like the Agrabah palace! You go dear Princess! Conquer the world and kick some butt!!! Bring along some jams with you just in case! 😘💎🐒🐯🕌🥖😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's our Jasmine! Love and hugs to you Naomi!!! 😘🥖🕌🐯🐒💎😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,No more Asian chick in charlies angels....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist bullshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart is pretty, but she always looks like she stinks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tell me why I thought *Kate McKinnon* and *Elizabeth Banks* were the same person.
FYI, Kate McKinnon is the blond from the Ghostbusters remake, while Elizabeth Banks is the blond playing Susan Bosely in this movie. But legit thought they were the same actress until I looked it up."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bootleg Kingsmen. Like seriously? Its the same scenes and jokes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mark my words: this movie will bomb.
The same is happening with Terminator."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m cringing already.
RSUq4VfWfjE,*A Charlie's Angels reboot no one asked for. I have a serious  case of sequelitis so this looks boring to me!*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw someone comment this but imagine Emma Watson alongside Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yay, more women beating up men, how realistic, how progressive... NOT. this movie looks like a pile of PC crap."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Characters with overconfidence and abundant arrogance kind of ruin the plot for these kinds of movies. It's boring when there is never any real danger to the main characters. These whamens are like indestructible superheroes so... ZZZZZZzzzzzzz
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤣👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,another box office bomb on the way.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't see them as Charlie's Angels at all except for the tall girl... the other two don't give off that tough badass vibe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The choice of angels is seriously doubtful. Like seriously Kristen? She cant even act.
RSUq4VfWfjE,My prediction...this movie will crash and burn. Mamma Mia! Total Crapola! This movie is made for the Centennial Generation and for this reason it's going to BOMB! I prefer watching reruns of the original show of the 70s than this swill.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People: How soon is it before we can remake a movie?

Them: yes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another all female film that will flop,  how does Hollywood stay in business"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen so Badaaass...
RSUq4VfWfjE,why Jane so high!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,00:47 name músic?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People: omg kristen is actually acting 
Me: i dont see a difference, îve always enjoyed her acting, in twilight and her other movies. Especially the cake eaters and the runaways.There are way worse actresses out there and she is prob the reason i am gonna watch this movie tbh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The film looks flat and generic...maybe it's just the trailer but it doesn't excite me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Reboot of a reboot. This is going to be a turd inside an abandoned truck stop toilet that won’t flush.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isn't Sabine the name of the SNL Totinos character Kristen plays?
RSUq4VfWfjE,i love how kristen is in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks about 3 exits beyond stupid. None of these women are sexy. None scare anyone. None have a personality. It's just a chick movie for the sake of a chick movie. Sad. Other than Quentin, NO ONE can think of anything original...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:27
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Staring - Elizabeth Banks
WITH - Elizabeth Banks
Directed By - Elizabeth Banks
ELIZABETH BANKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It was ruined when i saw noah
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can't wait to not watch. I vividly remember not watching the crappy Drew Barrymore version and coming away feeling like I dodged a bullet. A stupid, pointless bullet."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels Fly!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now that's my heroine! Kristen, Lots of love from India."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this going to be a movie or show??
RSUq4VfWfjE,How bad was Kristen in her previous roles that makes everyone in the comments happy about this role?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Çarlinin melekleri
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks trash😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie's gonna bomb if they keep making these gender statements. Litreally all these movies are putting this gender politics bs. We get it women  can do anything men can do. U don't need to keep addressing it. In fact if they keep doing this it will only make women seem insecure and always need to prove themselves
RSUq4VfWfjE,so excited for this movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,lol Jasmine and Snowwhite have retired 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tell me I'm not the only one who noticed the easter egg at 1:44. Those clothes were from the first movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,doesn't look terrible but I hate when they redo a film and don't give it a subtitle to differentiate it from the old one
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a trashy female version of the Expendables
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't Wait 💖😈
RSUq4VfWfjE,My lesbian heart is beating very fast
RSUq4VfWfjE,my biggest doubt was kristen but it seems like she is the only decent one
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:08 My eyes are blessed
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just got 12% gayer watching this trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella Swan turns into Snow white and now a freakin' spy
RSUq4VfWfjE,They keep advertising songs by Arianna grande and Miley Cyrus but I’m not interested in that. The movie looks awesome lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,More feminist crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmmm...I'm kinda interested to Ella Balinska
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I got one word ""AWESOME"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie franchise bites the dust
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Hollywood really thinks “men” are going to keep dropping big money at the movie theater to watch movies that Women are destroying just to get revenge on men?   Me & every other guy I know won’t drop a dime to watch any film that Women have purposely destroyed to for fill some feminist propaganda bullshit fake equality agenda.   I’m not paying $15 to watch Star Wars , 007 , Charlie’s Angels , terminator dark fate , any new Marvel film with a women as the lead hero & not because I don’t like strong women but because I don’t like feminist or any propaganda in my films.. so far every new movie where women have force their way into has failed when will Hollywood get a clue.?  Get fake woke go real broke"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I sure hope there’s enough women to make this movie successful because ain’t going to be no man going to go see it lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,They have done so hard work.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will never amount to the original....
RSUq4VfWfjE,The first two words that entered my mind after watching this trailer were 'Totally Spies'
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why can't they make a serious Charlie's Angels movie. 
The TV show was serious....I see this one will be silly as well. 
😫"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie isn't out yet and critics are ready to give it a 10/10
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only Kirsten Stewart can stand in for Drew. The rest are grossly under-cast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella Balinska looks so much like Kat Graham
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart!!!😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im excited for Kristen Stewart! Damn shes hot! 😍😍 dont really care about the other girls
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When is Hollywood going to learn, these feminazi remakes bomb every time!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m shook they stole the song from tall girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,These are some kick a* women in the movie and in real life
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:38 that’s... not how wearing a wig works lmao. You don’t take off a wig and have your real hair flow out and look perfectly styled. You take off a wig and reveal a wig cap, and under that is a weird lumpy style where your hair is in multiple braids and pinned to your scalp with about a million bobby pins."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will Ariana Grande be there
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen= trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,lackluster
RSUq4VfWfjE,Una impresionante muestra de como desperdiciar recursos (An impressive sample of how to waste resources)
RSUq4VfWfjE,can we just acknowledge naomi’s amazing american accent?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not the original, but I'm actually pretty excited to see this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can't wait to see it, it has Some cool action"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What date is this coming out
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else walking out if Crispin Glover ain’t back as the Thin Man
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else completely over the women empowerment move. Not saying I’m not for it but so over it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No-one asked for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,You cant beat the original Charlie's angels.. looking forward to seeing her from twilight in the new remake sexy lady
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ew why am I attracted to kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't take eyes from Kristen Stewart...
RSUq4VfWfjE,omg Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looooooks awesome ♥😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen has me on edge!! They Better not screw this classic up
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It would have been nice to see 3 all new famous female actresses, not just one (Kristen Stewert). Also none of them seem to have too much personality (I'm sure I could be wrong & just mistaken because I'm not familiar with the other 2) but I'm just saying. And it would've also been nice to see a dark skinned black female as a Charlie's Angel for once. I mean I usually don't say things race/skin color related and I'm a light skinned black woman myself.... but THIS was the time to bring in a dark skinned black woman & a latina too for these iconic roles. And they failed."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This millennium is really sucking more in more. Just in general.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looking at a thumbnail of the early 2000's Charlie's Angels with Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu........ and looking back up at the trailer in the video...... was a sad moment. 😢"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just saw this trailer on TV and every scene change, I said aloud ""Stupid, stupid, stupid, sjw stupid, and effin stupid."" Just stupid, keep your sjw remake, 110lb girl flipping a 240lb football player sized guy over her body after a headbutt? No, someone needs to tell you no, just NO no no more stupid female centric, men are stupid weak asshole pigs. My $ will never go 2 ur dumb movie's(ssssssss)."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oceans 8 part ll
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist agenda is out of the leaaaash!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I died a little when I saw Noah Centineo flirting
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Completely unrealistic, women ain't badass and I'm sick of all this force fed feminism bullshit. You chicks cant even complete with men in tennis let alone combat sports."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tell me one reason to watch this movie
Me: Kristen"
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOL This is going to fail LOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,honestly.... Kristen Stewart is killin' it! I could die of heart attack.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Titled should be Charlies angels & a TOMBOY.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""are you flirting with a handsome nerd?"" That made me cackle"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Because, why original ideas?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Our princesses turned 2020 queen mode.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look like a bunch of stank lesbians.
RSUq4VfWfjE,jasmine what are u doing here-
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I know that Kristin Stewart is hot and I'm gonna watch this because I'm gay :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,YAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!! Charlie's Angel ya allllllllll!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart ♡♡
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why they gotta sneak Noah Cintineo into every gosh darn movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ew is that noah sardino
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am so excited!! I LOVE KRISTEN!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Türkiye de çekmiş bunlar filmin bir kısmını haberimiz yok
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen ❤😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why isn’t the cast all male?? I thought everything was woke now? I guess it only goes one way....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing sexier then Kristin Stewart.

Said nobody."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie about petite women who can beat up everyone in the world... even Bosley is a fucking girl... these movies got little girls believing that women can beat up men. Am I the only person sick of women action movies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should’ve put the original theme. Or a remix of the Cam,Barry,Trio, film theme. This just looks bland and too pop song trendy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies: The Movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 the racecar and german song outfit from the original movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should have the old angles meet the new ones
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sir Patrick Stewart!?!!?!?!??! Take my money!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlies Angel must be
RED HAIR
BLONDIE
BLACK HAIR"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Who else misses the 2000s Charlie's Angels (Drew,Lucy,Cameron) ?*  🔫♀️👸🔪🗡️🤺"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eagerly waiting 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ill may watch this movie just to see charles xavier walks, it's the most  interesting part of the movie so far. So lame!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels? Looks more like Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did they get noah centipede for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*They still report to a man.*
Charlie = 1
Woke Angels = 0"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope Charlie its a men , since clearly everyone in this movie its a woman"
RSUq4VfWfjE,what's the song? I've been searching for days!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait for this 😆😆 but I will always love the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,please put me in jail than make me suffer thru any more dumb movie trailers!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m only here for Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is He in this...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for this at Redbox for $2 a day...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weeeew.excited to hear charlie's voice again hahahha
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just came to show my dislike.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a teen movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,There should be a Latina C ANGELS. Jennifer Lopez Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba's
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sorry no disrespect to the women in this new film. You cant compete with Cameron Diaz Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They should just retitle this ""Totally Spies"" and I'd be excited."
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:45 it's the costume from the 2000's charlie's angels!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,These dummies can't hold a candle to Drew/Lucy/Cameron. It's clear Elizabeth Banks got really bored after Pitch Perfect ended
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant wait to see this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Did Noah just said he likes the show he plays in, in another movie?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I watch the original Charlie's Angels in high school. I have never seen a Charlie's Angels movie and I've never had a desire to see a Charlie's Angels movie until I saw Kristen Stewart in a Charlie's Angels movie. I'm 100% in.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It kinda reminds me of Barbie Spy Squad idk why lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks like a wet noodle she is not angel material stop
RSUq4VfWfjE,For the white angel they cast the least attractive actress. Quite obvious diversity pushing there. Sad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Kristen still lesbian
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh it looks like into the intro always kristein became like a zombie with no feeling cant act symptomps are appearing
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks cute
RSUq4VfWfjE,Screenplay seems pretty bland but the fact that Kristen Stewart looks like she's having fun in a role makes it something I have to at least try. Plus I love Elizabeth Banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another 'woke' agenda filled mess, I'll pass on paying for this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So who's here after Ariana grande n miley cyrus song dont call me angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAHHH
RSUq4VfWfjE,Honestly looks like a bunch of twitch thots got their own movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now I feel so gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,+1 if you're watching this after youtube got rid of the subscribe buttons in vevo channels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm down with Kristen Stewart.
The other chicks nah."
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Charles Xavier changes his name to Charlie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought it was Emma Watson and now I'm really sad it isn't her.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i heard the trailer playing a few mins ago on my mom's computer and i had seen it beforehand... but i acted like i had no clue what it was and when i heard it i was like: THATS CHARLIE'S ANGELS
then i went up and asked: what is that??
then she told me what it was and it seemed questionable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll wait till it comes on HBO
RSUq4VfWfjE,"am I the only one getting triggered abt them using guns 








Charlie’s angels (2003) : “we don’t use guns anymore”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I stopped the trailer halfway to not see to much , What I can say is there’s hot women and action so I’m going to see it 👌🏾"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im  a real gangbanger
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I mean, I'll watch it...but I'll need to lower my expectations.  This is a FAR cry from Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Bill Murray, Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry, Crispin Glover, Luke Wilson and LL Cool J."
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like fallen angels.😂☺️😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Slap me now tell me why my dumbass just realized its a reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,To me the only thing that matters is the soundtrack and not the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whose here for Ariana grande.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm sorry but you can't replace the sexy voice of David Doyle as Bosley with a woman, has all the originality gone out of making movies.. Its HollyremakeWood these days."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's funny how Hollywood doesn't give up on some people even though the masses reject them, like the guy from Tokyo Drift. Kristen Stewart has never been able to convey an emotion in her entire career except for maybe constipation. Why is she continuously handed these major roles despite the glaringly obvious lack of talent? Gotta do some googling and find out who she's related"
RSUq4VfWfjE,bagus versi lama
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Women can do anything"" Yeah, only in fiction movies. Lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m shocked because Kristen actually looks like she’s acting for a change.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ไม่สวยเลยทั้งสามคน  นางฟ้าตกกระป๋องเหรอ  No one look attractive or beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this must be in original movie cuz I've never seen this before
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is extra hot here
RSUq4VfWfjE,This aint Joker
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1st reboot: Crap 
2nd reboot: Crap Deluxe"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks so badass I can’t-
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's like mix of bratz and totaly spices, but movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i don't like it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nah.....think I'll pass. The 2003 version was fun, but the sequel bombed, the 2011 TV show bombed......now this? No thanks- I'll watch Kate, Farrah, Jacklyn, Cheryl,  Shelley and Tanya."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noel cactusmateo 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hate re-boots and re-makes especially if they are needless like this one, but also i can do anything for Kristen Stewart & Naomi Scott, so!..
😘😍😋/😛😜😝"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Leave the real Charlie's Angels alone.  This looks really dumb.  Bosley a female?  Not.  Kristen Stuart makes me want to vomit.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where my Krisbians at??? Twihards unite ❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They should have made this one with guys instead, Charlie’s faggots."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The  O.R.I.G.I.N.A.L  TV series Charlie's Angels was always the best. REAL BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
NO botox,fillers,implants,nothin fake.

❤Farrah Fawcett
❤Kate Jackson,
❤Jaclyn Smith
❤Cheryl Ladd
❤Shelley Hack
❤Tanya Roberts 

and Bosley was a MAN not a 
woman....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,She looks like Emma at 1:25
RSUq4VfWfjE,This one is a Charlie's greatest failures
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is noah in legit everything- 
I was fine with him at first but now eh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen but blonde is sooooo not her color.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yall keep saying this is a feminist movie...but if it was all men then no one would have a problem🤔🤔🤔idc what y’all say. I’d kill to see Kirsten dancing and Princess Jasmin beat some people up. And hey! Holtezman stopped catching ghost??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok this looks so freaking cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why cant this movie be called charlies demons with an all men cast?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another corny remake! Hollywood has no more creativity or vision anymore! They have to take from the original great movies and taint them with their ideology of today's stupidity!
RSUq4VfWfjE,from director who ? OMG trashmovie
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like garbage no offence 😖 its so awkward and cheesy and the aesthetic is completely fucked
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another ridiculous grrl power movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uh no thanks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,She's ugg. Lol and her acting too lol the best part is when she smacks her butt with that pole lol what is she hitting? Cardboard?! Lol 😂😂😂 the only way I would see this movie is if I didn't have to pay for it lol xD
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All I see in Elizabeth Banks , is Effie Trinket. I can’t unsee it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF!! Ughhhhhh.. Why do Hollywood have to remake every classic and  fu×k it up?!?!? SMDH
RSUq4VfWfjE,I GOTTA SEE THIS!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,wait I thought charlie's angels don't use guns???
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just lost brain cells watching this garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For once I am optimistic about Kirsten Stewart's acting, hopefully it won't be a let down. Also nothing will ever replace the last three angels, but I am interested to see what this different version offers."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait bosley is a female????? No....
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks like it'll be so fun!! i can't wait!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie screams SJW..... feminism... we hate men bullshit lol.

Go woke go broke right?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is this like ghost busters reboot? 
Meh not interested"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:16 what is the title of the song??? plzz
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles X. Xavier's mutants to Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,ok but why tf is Noah centino in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like it will get a 30% on rotten tomatoes. I waited 16 years for this so I hope I'm wrong.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course there is a female bosly 🤦‍♀️ feminist
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What a BOMB... that's RIGHT a total BOMB, as in it SUCKED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,okay but what is noah centineo or whateva doing here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMFG I CAN’T WAIT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anitta 🇧🇷❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eh movies gonna be alright just another cash grab
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyones' talking about the two Whites chicks but who's the tall Afro chick I hear a British accent? She reminds me of the Brazilian model Lais Ribeiro!
RSUq4VfWfjE,YO.. Is it just me but Kristen Stewart looks way more attractive with her short blond hair.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels 2019 trailer 
First 10s - ""Don't call me angel"" and their 1000 shoe closet.
This looks like Disney trash for underage feminists"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay, I might actually be looking forward to this one."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I'm surprised Hollywood didn't cast three black chicks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wish I could see movies with girls doing cool stuff, being powerful, successful, etc, but without it being a cheap political statement. Oh well, its easy and apparently it works for a lot of moviegoers."
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:34
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks they did not bring back the original Charlie Angels Camren Diaz Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's sad that there is no asian Korean or Chinese girl in this movie. Meh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why tf is that noah guy there-
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Completely lost the sultry, sexy tone of the originals in place for a bunch of not funny sjw 'quirky' non jokes..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie about lesbians
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm a  straight woman but Kristen is really testing. I wasn't even a fan
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:23 kristen stewarts face, im dyiny for it. 😍 cutie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wonder if people actually know who the Original Charlie's 😇 are. The original angels were natural BEAUTIES!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry if it ain't broken don't fix it. The Original is always the BEST, although Lucy Lui & Cameron Diaz did a phenomenal job on the reboot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think the movie will be better if Ariana was playing in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like a made for MTV movie.  This is one of those films where the intelligent ask, “Why?”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't mind me, just coming through to leave a well deserved dislike."
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is so cool but I prefer the really first charile's angels the 70s.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don’t tell me that mint scene isn’t from kingsmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a made for TV movie for Lifetime Network smh 🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to watch this. Love all these girls especially Naomi and Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The original was so iconic, so fulfilling, how was this necessary in any way"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another bomb..blame men for not going..
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS MOVIES ARE SOOOOOO STUPID
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is going to bomb so tremendously. It didn’t work the first two times, it won’t work this time either. It was a terrible show to begin with. Take a hint Tinseltown..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was hoping this was a backstory to why Madison Lee went rouge. As she made it clear that back in the day they used guns. That would of been better I think. The effects are obviously better here but I wonder if they will keep it similar. One of them loves to dance, the other is super smart and the last falls for the bad guys 😩😂."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They  actually showed Charlie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like if you’re here for Kirsten Stewart only
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is pretty but she looks like she doesn’t changer her underwear
RSUq4VfWfjE,The world does not need another Charlie’s angels movie 🤦🏾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t think it looks that bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for it to come out
RSUq4VfWfjE,The reboot no one asked for
RSUq4VfWfjE,What’s with the Disney channel intro?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I would only watch this for ""jasmine"" and kristen stewart."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missing hints of the original theme song. Pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,DELETE DELETE DELETE
RSUq4VfWfjE,When do this realise
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I mean I will watch this, but like others are saying Diaz/Liu/Barrymore had much better chemistry."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They can not top or even be near the original CHARLIES ANGELS..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why am i finally finding out about this i looked it up cuz hannah Montana cast on Snapchat & i looked at the video it said (Charlie's Angels)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"edit: oh nvm that barbie movie was inspired by the old ver. of this one
*this is exactly like the Barbie Spy Squad movie*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We were cheated out of this song, the trailer really hyped up this song and than when the song was finally released we got that trash🤢🤢"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Are you freaking kidding me.



NOAH CENTINICKLE IS IN THIS MOVIE ARGHSKCNISFUSO DJEISBFN 😖"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie might be interesting but what was wrong with the one Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Lu were in? It may be just me but I think those woman were more beautiful and looked more badass. Plus, I don't care for Kristin Stewart's short hair but she's doing whatever she wants."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope this is no Charlie’s angles sorry 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"She was supposed to be catwoman, 'jane' but instead she got this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:45 there was the clothes that the old Charlie's angels used before
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I feel disappointed like I honestly think nothing can top the 2000s version, but idk maybe it’s the trailer making it look bad to me"
RSUq4VfWfjE,ok but the girls in this movie are STUNNING
RSUq4VfWfjE,I say no thank you
RSUq4VfWfjE,É impressão minha ou apareceu a cidade do Rio de janeiro? 🇧🇷
RSUq4VfWfjE,ANITTA RAINHA!❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,They made this movie and logo goes perfect with Arians grande song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Those straight sexist men are the reason why this video has so many dislikes and sexist men are stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok Ladies let's put some bling $$$$$$$$& back into the pockets of our OWN. Aim and star
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why can't we have bad guys also played by females. that would be fun.i mean no man at all angels are throwing, punching, blowing all the bad bitchs! Or am being to progressive?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where is the oriental girl and redhead? o.O I prefer old version, this not look Charlie's Angels for me, looks other movie!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pantera - Anitta
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s coming out on my birthday 😁😁😁😁😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angel:don't call me angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Plenty of lip biting, odd blinking and looking off in the distance from Bella I see."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disney  keep ruining movies Straight to dvd 📀 or Netflix 😬not Charlie’s Angel totally spies renamed it might be more interesting
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo?? Again ?? Really???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just can't accept kristen stewart as a sex symbol 🤬.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They absolutely ruined it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing bits the original sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who’s Charle tho?
RSUq4VfWfjE,point break 2015 all over again
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Apparently there isn't any original idea in Hollywood anymore.  I can't believe they're remaking this...again.  On the bright side, I'll save $15 by not purchasing a ticket to this one."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody can beat the real angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does Noah Centineo have to be in every frickin movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This garbage will make the Ghostbusters remake look like Citizen Kane.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"These women have no flair, personality, or natural talented.
And this is just viewing the trailer!😩"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The casting director should be fired!😧
RSUq4VfWfjE,Out of soo many great female actors they picked the most bland unmemorble group of women..this looks like it sucks!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope that throw some love to the 1st and 2nd Gen Angel's. It'd be nice to see a cameo or two.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well this looks WHACK. I’m just now hearing about this and it won’t compare to the Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lui, and Drew Barrymore trio. And since when is Bosley a woman? Makes no sense. I bet one of them is going to be a lesbian too.. which is stupid I wish they’d stop changing characters completely.... 3 new angels I can handle but then they changed Bosleys race (full throttle) and his gender.. Woulda been better had they continued where they left off where Shia Labeouf was the next Bosley."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who told Kristen she was allowed to be in movies again??
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Kristen tries really hard to be a Drew all I see is desperation 🙄 UGG and Bosley is a Man man!! This movie will do great on rotten tomatoes 🍅!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You can't have a spy movie without exploding mints, extra points if a naive character tries to eat one."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is ugly
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍 fans like 👇
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I mean I’m gonna give it a fair chance but nothing tops the Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz one for me"
RSUq4VfWfjE,@NEO Coffee
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn’t know Jasmine turned into a spy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boy, TV-based movies are really driving away from their source material."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the intro music from y’all girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centeneo em as Panteras 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The question is: will they lean too heavily on expectations that people will watch a remake just because it’s a remake- or will they actually put effort into this script?
Only time will tell..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Después de haber visto a Kristen como Bella, no puedo tomarla en serio al interpretar cualquier otro papel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmmm. I think this one is a better version to be honest.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Ariana Grande version of Charlie’s Angels film in 2000!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't really care, but I'm here for Kristen Stewart regardless."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow Kristen Stewart with smile? Im shook, but eyes still look dead to be honest,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"does not look even remotely interesting, yawn"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is ariana😅😇
RSUq4VfWfjE,The cast sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watch one of these broads pull a publicity stunt against whites or men In general
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who like naomi scott i like her so much
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Its not gonna be better than the older ones, if anything this one looks trash and not worth seeing it'd be a waste of money.  And of course Hollywood replaces another male role with a female ""bosley""... when are they gonna learn thats a dumb horrible idea? Ghostbusters bombed cause of the women cast, the news oceans 9, etc they seriously need to chill with all that... fucking new batwoman is garbage also"
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen is dope!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can i get a like for drew cameron and lucy! The best movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies angels are suppose to be hot. these women look so average.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh i thought it was ellen dgeneres ahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,literally no one asked for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,They shouldve added the orchestra at the chorus shown in the trailer to the actual song
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought it was a joke from looking at the thumbnail
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hard pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who else was like 
OMG Effie!!!!!!!!!!
(Elizabeth banks)
You know Effie in the hunger games?i"
RSUq4VfWfjE,UGH THEY SHOULD HAVE PICKED ME AS THE ASIAN GIRL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weak
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m disappointed that there is no redhead
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whose mouth was 👉😱 when they saw Noah
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Much much much better looking cast than in the last movie.  I do t think anyone is as pretty as the original cast though.  The black girl is in the same league though, whoa."
RSUq4VfWfjE,mal posso esperar 🤙🏼
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why aren’t the women replaced with men ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Finally Kirsten have some mimics, opposite to the twilight and few others where her only face was brain-less open mouth one dooh 😦"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kris's attitude man!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,After Ruby Rose now Kristen will be making girls gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like teen version of Charlie Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am actually getting a feel that this movie will suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,If a boy watch’s this movie that means he is gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,i like the felt pun
RSUq4VfWfjE,is this like a spoof of the version from 2000
RSUq4VfWfjE,Couldn’t they find a redhead too? 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg pure trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's some excellent CGI. Kristen Stewart's smile is almost real. That must be a tough job for the CGI team to make Kristen Stewart have a secondary emotion.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only came to see Ariana and then no
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Ariana Grande liked this*
RSUq4VfWfjE,How did Kristen Stewart get so hot omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The worst soundtrack for a movie like this, honestly, it's very annoying to hear this song while watching itt actually ruined the entire trailer like fuc*! I cannot watch this movie!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith are the true/original Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like this movie would’ve been even more fire if Sandra bullock was in it lmaoo
RSUq4VfWfjE,What’s the theme they play at the beginning? Like the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whats with the “And you’re watching Disney Channel” intro.
RSUq4VfWfjE,YES!!!!! GIRL POWER!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen hasn’t been a movie I’ve seen since twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Istanbul❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Womannnnm
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen? Bad actress🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,My guess is 50million. thats how much it will lose at the box office.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah...….this sucks.  Charlie Angels is NOT meant to be the HUGE MIB wannabe crap.  They serve for the common joe.  Yet another train wreck that's going to happen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jonathan Moss Tucker is in this! 😂😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks unwatchable. Hollywood garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woaw i love this new version of totally spies...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, did Kristen learn to express emotions?) The trailer is cool🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,And people wonder why nobody wants a female James Bond.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg kristen. lm so excited to watch
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh.. they should’ve given the other two angels to Meghan Fox and Zoe Saldana. But yes new Kristen!
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS MUST BE SOO COOLL!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yes.  This is the way it should have been done 19yrs ago.  It was so cheesy, very hard to watch.  We need more badass women films.  And Elizabeth Banks??   I will watch anything she is involved in."
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of my fav teasers same for that teaser with Margot Robbie in the elevator
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women can do everything but get an erection.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did they change the Angel's names??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"and just like that, another franchise bites the dust!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell yesss my Kristen steward 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seem utterly progressive, will skip it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kind of wished Emma Watson was in this alongside Kristen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,am i the only one who's comparing the 1st Charlie's angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super hai trailer india faan
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many lesbos in this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,She said bad guy. That's sexist.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,can't wait to see kristie kill this role 🥰🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,i thought ella balinska was bonnie from vampire diaries for a second..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was excited about this film but after seeing the overwhelmingly unnecessary feminist messages throughout the trailer just ruined it. It’s like they can’t do a remake without forcing their politics in it lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love the 2:26 part of this trailer. Vintage style.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is the only wrong thing in this movie. Ella Ballinska is amazing. She's perfect for the role.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi's acting is phenomenal. Just needed a bit more, emotion and character, from Kristen and it would have been perfect."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry but no.. some films just can’t be remade. I’m all about the OG’s
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn i miss the 2003 version with cameron diaz, drew barrymore& lucy liu. That iconic scene where Cameron is dancing on stage with nipples marked on her top 😍🤪"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart brought hype
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who like Kristen stewart hit the 👍🏻button
👇🏻"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This cast is so insulting to the original lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All the ingredients are in place, but it stills feels pathetic."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait anymore……I love kristen acting💯🥰👏🏻🙌🏻💪🏻 she's the purest's💕💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aren’t the Charlie’s Angels supposed to be attractive?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Osm
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder what the people who disliked the trailer think? Because I think this reboot would be awesome if the story is... Well... very substantial. :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,only watching because of elizabeth banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks much better feminine

RSUq4VfWfjE,"i guess kristen's trying her best but no one from the 3 is selling the role of a super fit, engaging spy to me"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This film is a Feministic campaign against all the men out there. Why the charlie's angels can't be men? Why you only see men being ""seduce"" without consent in this trailer? This is offensive. You can be better..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thanks Kristen Stewart! 
I’m gayer now."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why isn't there a person with a handicap cast as an angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf? Where is ariana grandee?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""check out charlie's angels right now""
*music plays*
""dont call me angel"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate this trailer I think this remake go be a big FLOP. I need Charlie s Angels 3 with @LucyLiu @DrewBarrymore @CameronDiaz .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ain't the charlie angels spose to be Idk...hot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missing original angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible

RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here for Kristen Stewart ❤ she is just amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey... Guys... It's the entire movie they just slapped into the trailer. No need to see the movie now I guess
RSUq4VfWfjE,This gonna by awesome movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well this looks horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,не то кино. до тех актеров им очень далеко.
RSUq4VfWfjE,First trio of Charlie's Angels still the best.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are the angels all female? This film is clearly lacking diversity so Im boycotting
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow.😮.the new charlie's angel..😍i love dis movie🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bs
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love kristen steward💕💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,There actually making a movie 😮
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Comment statistics:

25% Noah Centinao mixed reactions 
24% Opinions on the movie/trailer
1% me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nopppe nada nooooooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,So it’s basically a spy movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did Kristen Stewart sleep with the director in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women's power😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Total crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So cool! Can't wait for this to come out!
Moreover: who wants more collabs like ""Angel""?😍😍😍😍😍
Ps. I made a cover of the song in sign language. If you want, come see it on my channel🤗🤗"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing beats the 2003 Charlie's Angel's. The second one was even more amazing. RIP Bernie mac. Go back and watch the original trailers. They gave me goosebumps and made me laugh. Not too excited for this one but I do love Elizabeth Banks. We shall see :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why does ""Don't Call Me Angel"" is more beautiful to listen in the trailer compared to the studio version? We raised our expectation smh. Hahahahaha"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another unnecessary remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Snow White and jasmine on a general mision ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noahhhh 😂❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Soooo really there’s only 2 angels & than they find a 3rd ... eh okay. ... still not sold. I appreciate the fact they’ve got some of the outfits from the original 2 movies. Hopefully they’ll be more references. 
Kristen Stewart is definitelyy carrying this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well , professor Xavier look happy in this trailer"
RSUq4VfWfjE,why no guy as charlie's angel? what happened to diversity? this is outrageous.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was like woowwww Charlie's Angels AGAIN😍😍😍.
BUT when I saw the casts I'm like 😒😒😔.. Not interested anymore..🙄
I would love to see Gal Gadot, Rihanna, Sandra Bullock as Angels 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im already sick of seeing this trailer in the ads. Ive been awake for an hour and already seen this 10 times as an ad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone notices the clothes 1:33? Those are customes used from the previous charlies angels movie...  Specially that dutch dress..  Thats in a very funny scene
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart🤗
RSUq4VfWfjE,Só vim pela Anitta 🇧🇷 💚
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is bleeding how many remake .. BORING BIG TIME
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Amazing and interesting, can't wait😍😍😍👍👍👍💖💖💖"
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like no fun at all. Yuk
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If that is the girl from that Twilight saga, this movie is for justin Bieber fans. Feminist and multi cultural bull crap again."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is anyone else upset by this???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew, Cameron and Lucy the real Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im so addicted to C stewart! She can pull off ANYTHING & look amazing !😍 cant wait to see this!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,What crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is big mistake for the role. Producers what were you thinking about. This movie will fail.
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOPE! 😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love Naomi Scott❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to see this!!!❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I saw this trailer in the theater, didn't expect Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,is this remake of Charlie's Angel 2000 movie of Cameroon Diaz?
RSUq4VfWfjE,🌽
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana said it, dont call her hair gel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I cant wait not to watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shia labeouf should’ve been Bodley to connect it to the previous one 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, I know Charlie's angels and they are not on the list!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No need for this film
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For me, Bosley (Elizabeth Banks) will save this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh why is Kristen Stewart in it!!!!!!Definitely NOT watching.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone knows why the old Actress dont Play the roles?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks stupid, I don’t know why everyone in Hollywood thinks people will go wild about Charlie’s angels. The song sucks to."
RSUq4VfWfjE,bella swan all grown up....😭😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"what i love the old angel is they made angel has own personality in that movie.. 
cameron - sassy high kick, charisma bossy thats why her always centre posititon and little bit childish inside (dancing and love puppy) FIERCE
lucy - smart clever high IQ technology, femininism,sweet and lovely SEXY
drew - rock and roll, rough, but most sweet hearted, playful, STRONG"
RSUq4VfWfjE,get ready for the next big shhhhhh.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hear birds can't fly this high. 
I hear Angels can't fly this high."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg I have to see this!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thing about Charlie's Angels is that they looked harmless, but they were deadly. These girls look badass from jump. Idk if it fits the brand. I may be too old for this remake"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ve always loved Kristen Stewart as an actress. She’s so talented. I hope people are finally starting to see that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another piece of crap,shoving ""women empowerment"" down our brains.
I hope when the chips are down,we don t rely on such incompetent garbage."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Actually looks great
RSUq4VfWfjE,omg Bombastic.. and i thought it won't be used anywhere
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wasn't the original idea of Charlie's Angels that they were supposed to be attractive?
RSUq4VfWfjE,what chapter is this??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's an extravaganza of silliness.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo ruined this for me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is now an expert at destroying movie classics with shitty SJW remakes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen 😳😳😳
RSUq4VfWfjE,This woke pos will flop.  Just watch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This feels nothing like Charlie's Angel's! The vibes are so off.. wheres the fun of everything but still down to business and being bad a... smh.. they need to just stop while they are ahead!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen talks like an animated character
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Kristen's facial expression improved and she looks hella hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn't see Ariana grande 😥😤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dont liked
RSUq4VfWfjE,None of these girls are remotely in likes of Diaz/Barrymore/liu.... Just look at both movie posters and compare their personalities and you will know what I’m talking about.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Going to see it🔥 I was just like..it’s about time for another Charlie’s Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one can replace the original Angels. And when I first saw Kristen Stewart I gagged. Like why? But after seeing the trailer, she actually looks like she's acting. So okay I'll give it a shot. But still, can't replace the original Angels 😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think Ella Balinska should be the next Bond girl...she's British, she's 5'10"", beautiful in that exotic way and she's had formal cinematic combat training . (IMDb: Balinska trained at the Guildford School of Acting and acquired her combat skills with the Academy of Performance Combat.) so she'd be perfect ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Definitely a waste of a remake of a movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,My only question is why no red heads?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Black widow somewhere laughing
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm sorry, you have the Patrick Stewart in a Charlie's Angels movie and he isn't the voice of Charlie? Travesty!

How is his voice not perfect for it?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So they literally filmed some of it in Istanbul? For real? I'm excited!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"literally NO ONE asked for a charlie’s angels reboot & if you couldn’t get the original cast members than you shouldn’t have made another one . Yes i’m salty, and i hope it does terrible"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😾 This sucks balls so hard. Thanks for ruining my childhood 😿
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok. But is anyone going to do flying kicks in the air whilst in slow motion tho🤷🏾‍♀️ idk about this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What would Drew Barrymore do.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anitta.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"wow, no one has any charisma in this movie.
how can i differentiate between those 3 dead corpses on the screen ?
oh, so this movie made to sell some pop songs, now it all seems logical."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can someone explain to me why isn’t the cast males? Only female cast and this is fucking sexist in my opinion
RSUq4VfWfjE,Singer Brazilian *Anitta*  🇧🇷❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not the least bit interested in seeing this feminist bullshit. First line in the preview is the pole parroted lie that woman are equal to men. They aren't and we can prove that if you ladies like.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"for whatever reason Kristen gives out the magnetic vibe and charm of Troye Sivan, anyone?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like the cast, but the trailer was meh and that soundtrack is terrible."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice 😘😎👊👄
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omaidad i saw that netflix guy hahahhaa
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bellas gone badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Another classics ruined
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t agree with animal abuse..riding a horse is an abuse!!!
Go Vegan World and stop this slavering of animals!
✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is where all the Into the spider verse money went Huh.  Thanks Sony we really needed this.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Se a Anitta estar aqui 🇧🇷❤️❤️nos também estamos 🔥❤️🍀👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻amazing movie 🎥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y'all keep complaining that Hollywood keeps doing remakes but this is a continuation of the series just in the future with new angels...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so frickin gay for Kristen😏
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies!! In theatres soon LOl
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Um filme aleatória da vida: a
Anitta: deixa eu cantar produção?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"u know... it kinda looks like GG (Girls Generation) the symbol of the wings , is it just me or others think that too?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Quem depois de Anitta?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I cant stop looking at kristen... wow, very beautiful!! Theres something in her eyes.. mysterious and fierce.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,First 20 seconds into the trailer... “oh mah goodness Kirsten! .... *chuckles* OH MAH GOODNESS KRISTEN!!!”
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie Xavier's Angel? 😆😆😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,Keoooo lokaaaaaa😳😳mis 4 amoress en una peliculaaa!😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,The originals are better
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Believe or not. They put any single black role in remake movies now and make it so annoying and unnatural. Remake “Charmed” is the same, horrible x10 :(("
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hands up for snow white and princess jasmin 😍🙌
RSUq4VfWfjE,I prefer the og angels.... maybe I’ll watch it just to see how it turns out maybe not.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why the hell is noah creampuff in this movie lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,"aaah, the fact they used the PP3 place too"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does Netflix has this movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,omgggg janelle monáe's music on top of the scene with kristen stewart in the beginning 😍 i'm so gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ooooyyyyyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,at least kristen and ella are hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can we just appreciate how far Naomi Scott came? From Lemonade Mouth to Power Rangers, Aladdin and then Charlie's Angels. You go girlll ❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,bwahahahaha what a pile of garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:57
RSUq4VfWfjE,Alguém tbm achou parecido com as 3 espiãs de mais?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why kristen stewart looks so perfect. Omg i can't stand it 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bella sih emang charlies angel, or charlie's daughter hehe.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They all look like prostitutes! Lol!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmm... Actually it looks kinda fine
RSUq4VfWfjE,How did they add “featuring the new single”?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is not accurate to the original Charlie's Angels Plus they fucked It Up by putting Kristen Stewart in a roll got two girls that are nobodies and the names are wrong Bosley is a woman and Charlie's never to be seen this movie is stupid the original names of the Charlie's Angels was Natalie Dylan and Alex not Elena not Jane I'm sure as hell not Sabrina and they worked for a private organization to help people not because the cops weren't doing their job they took on clients not this bullshit about there's an overflow crime and the cops couldn't handle it and I'm just not going to watch it because Kristen Stewart's in it she's basically been drawing at straws since the Twilight movies went out so hate on me if you want it's my opinion and your opinion really doesn't matter because opinions are like assholes everybody has one and you can be one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels don't use guns!!!!!! 😠😠😠
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noooo so bad it used to be fun they all boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,They got ready of my asian
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's my asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:53  okey that place make the movie looks like Kingsman 😣 i have a bad feeling about this haha
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart is my perfect idea of a boyish girl...for some reason, i think boyish girls are cool...i cant really explain it. They just do something to me...I know Kristen doesnt like men, but i'd still tap her..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is actually really fucking sexy in this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Another movie thats gonna shyt all over men and have anorexic looking women beating up Black Ops dudes.  Just what we all need.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Only kristen's role appears interesting here. Never heard of ella before, but just from the trailer her role appears really flat and boring."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just can't stop seeing ellens face whenever i see kirsten in that hairstyle lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen!!! 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY IS BOSLEY A WOMAN????????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Racial discrimination is too serious. It may be a black-and-white hybrid. Whites and Middle Eastern or Indian hybrids but no Asians..............
Is this fear that Asia is too strong?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart in this role will be my undoing send help 🤤🔥😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY THE HEL IS NOAH CENTINEO IN HERE!!??!?!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen in that Gymnast outfit though.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Like… I just recognized her face…
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yep I just got it from myself
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well nevermind… myself…
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just got this from Ariana Grande… IS THAT NAOMI SCOTT?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it Ariana grade or is it Naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks freaking awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is TERRIBLE
RSUq4VfWfjE,At 1:44 you can see two outfits from the 2000 Charlie’s Angels movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley ain’t a woman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im so excited to watch these
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original Charlie's Angels is way better 💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,"GARBAGE! As a Charlie’s Angels (original) series fan, making Charles Angels a comedy with women acting like teenage misfits doesn’t work, it didn’t work in the first installment with Lucy Lu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore. Charlie’s Angels needs to be more like James Bond, Salt, Atomic Blonde, and Halle Berry in John Wick 3. The storyline and tone needs to be slightly dark, and the characters should be far more mysterious. Their handler, Bosley should always be a male, he could even be a gay guy, yet even more dangerous than the Angels since he is tasked with watching over them, but the gender differences adds a complexity to the storyline. The angels should also be in the business of assassinating mutherfuckers...it’s 2020, it’s time the Angels evolved!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The 2000 and 2003 movies is always gonna be the best
RSUq4VfWfjE,well thanks to patrick stewart.. i’m actually giving this a chance to see on theaters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart aka lisa from zathura snow white from snow white and the huntsman and bella swan from the twilight saga now starring as sabina in Charlie's Angels😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only thing that I really liked about this, is the style that they put on kristen stewart"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wack
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG!! I miss Kristen Stewart so bad😭😭😭👏👏👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,i really dont like Kirsten....sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was just watching the 2000s films thinking they should remake it, but this honestly looks like disappointment. Where's the beautiful Asian woman? I figured they'd have a white black and an Asian woman.  You can't subtract from diversity once it's implemented. It feels like whitewashing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh Lord,they are going to ruin this icon."
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is Patrick Stewart doing in this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought Bosly was a guy. Bill Murray from the original films.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oo i see NOAH CENTINEO  . . 😶
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow they shoot couple scenes in Turkey ? I saw Turkish flag in one scene and mosque .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Becky sue movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow foreign version ni Liza soberano  si ( Kristen Stewart)
RSUq4VfWfjE,There is the spice girls
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMIIII
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirstennnnn😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,shia should've been bosley :/
RSUq4VfWfjE,are you flirting with a handsome nerd?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh look.  It's Totally Spies, the movie...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know about you guys, i don't really care about this charlie's angels but if there will be naomi, count me in !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn Girl Kristen Stewart is Hot 🔥 in this Movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO
RSUq4VfWfjE,:/ noooo I’m sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen 4EVER!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:38 keteknya itam
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There's just something about the Diaz/Barrymore/Liu trio that just can't be exceeded, sorry."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE A REMAKE I DONT THINK THAT YOU SHOULD


Bear with me, there is no way that this could be better than the old Angels (Lucy, Drew, and Cameron)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought it was a joke, it's not."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I mean I’m not blown away but this might be fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oooo that's my kind if movie I'm in love when it's coming out
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh Jenelle monéa🤩🤩🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a shitshow
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hillary. Clinton. Lost.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Last angels didn’t need guns 😆😆😆😆😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella? Kristen ahhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its look  like a beautie  rock
RSUq4VfWfjE,""" Are you flirting with the handsome nerd ?"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Snowhite and vampire has left the chat 🌚
RSUq4VfWfjE,They don’t need this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scotttt🖤🖤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am reading the comments and was wondering about kirsten's name was in every comment. Wth , I didnt see it coming. Shes cool with that hair tho. 😍😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks absolutely soulless
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie : hello angels! Are you ready?
Kristen,Naomi,Ella : yes, Charlie
Ariana,Miley,Lana : ""Boy,don't call me angel"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,How didnt we notice Ariana Granda Voice before DONT CALL ANGEL in this Trailer 😱😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,How did Kristen go from this sweet lonely girl to this stripper like assassin....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whose here after listening to SOUTH OF THE BORDER???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Honestly the original was the best. But I do like modern tech in this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, it felt so weird seeing Patrick Stewart stand up..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boringggg ......  Hollywood should stop making movies ,they have very little new  imaginative and creative new film releases..... They only have  old classic remakes remakes remakes ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Achhhk like Cameron, lucy and drew better"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've seen the old ones. This is going to be Interesting.  I'm already facinated.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reminds me of when they try to reboot charmed
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's here of South of the border mv??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cameron please come out of retirement  and give us CA3. It's painful to watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,... why does this give me Totally Spies vibes? /: was the cartoon based off of the older Charlie’s Angels movies? 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In the closet you can see a nod to some of the old outfits from Cameron Diaz, Lucy lu, and drew berrymore 💙"
RSUq4VfWfjE,How dare you remake Charlie's Angel's and ruin it
RSUq4VfWfjE,The boys have to fight back if they make a movie about that
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait a minute I thought they are angels because it said Charlie’s angel with an angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,All time fav
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know what we really need is a all male reboot of charlies angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cameron diazs version was perfect. This new movie is just a trying hard copycat
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cool. Awesome.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Markian? at 2:06-2:10? Or not?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I ddin't feel any charlies angle vibes.. Sorry...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Stil prefer Cameron,drew and Lucy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:09 I thought that was Kristen Stewart and then I checked the description and I WAS RIGHT

RSUq4VfWfjE,Live Action de Três espiãns demais
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is oh so hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pqp Que filme do crlh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Individually they have a great persona but together they don't seem to have great on-screen chemistry. The casting was forced imo. I don't know, I'm more pumped with Arianna, Miley, and Lana than these three."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who wants to bet this one won’t get a sequel, I mean if this is the best trailer than it shouldn’t, I mean even the trailers for the old Charlie’s angels movies with Lucy liu, drew berrymore, and Cameron Diaz trailers drew me in more and not just because of how famous they were"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excited much 👌 love it ❤ another Charlie's Angels is in the Area.. haha 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,My one of the most favorite movie 😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:55 WHO WATCHED MUDER MYSTERY KNOWS WHO THIS BOY IS
RSUq4VfWfjE,why does noah scented mayo and Naomi Scott low key look like brother and sister
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imagine being so unoriginal that you start remaking movies from the last decade.  More feminist propaganda from Hollywood.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bunch of crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why should noah be in every movie ?? wtf
RSUq4VfWfjE,_I mean it's okay doesn't really capture my attention like the Cameron Diaz one tho_
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood stop remaking movies that didn’t need to be remade in the first place challenge: FAILED
RSUq4VfWfjE,I definitely want to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:25 to 1:27 Kristen like Kate Jackson from the original series (3x19)
RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell SJW and I don't like it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,This 2019 version sucks. I wouldn't  watch this pathetic movie for free. The cast sucks! To much SJW BS too.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"woowww,☺️☺️☺️👌"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Meu deuuuus!! Q esse filme venha pro Brasil
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Haha hell...
 I saw PETER 😳"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The reboot of a remake nobody wanted.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked the original ones more aye
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only people I feel sorry for are the people looking forward to this. Nobody should be made fun of for their tastes in movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT FROM  ALADDIN!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had to stop watching this b.s. no way !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart!!!! 😄😍💓😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why everyone saying Kristen is happy?

RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer gave me cancer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,PRINCESS JASMINE WHATCHA DOIN THERE?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks cheap
RSUq4VfWfjE,"🙄 so what we needed was yet another shitty remake  based on a below average set of movies, that were based on a groundbreaking rv show

Sure, because we wouldn't want to do anything original"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlies Feminists.
Charlies Angels beats up men for fun.
Charlies Angels don't need no man.
Charlies Angels *F* *e* *i* *S* *t* *Y*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i miss the old kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to see this movie RIGHT NOW
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angels is the best movie the new one will be the best one yet to see
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watching Joker today was an awesome experience.... except for this cringey empowered trailer that I had to watch before it started.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love you Naomi Scott ( Princess Jasmine)👸🏽🤴🏽
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love you Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:53 The Chad???
RSUq4VfWfjE,But except for the characters
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just kidding I just hate the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate Charlie’s angels you know why I’m a boy 😤that’s it disliked
RSUq4VfWfjE,I always love kristen Stewart gosh she is so fvckin girl crush
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's here after watching the music video don't call me angel !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Which is the SJW lesbian? Is it the one with the short hair?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm glad Jasmine decided to take a gap year from being a sultan to become an agent.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No Ariana - no deal
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I loved the original as a teen... If you get my Drift.  This looks fun.. I Just hope its not pants, as I'm a big Kirsten Stewart fan."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OK, so the main cast is 3 sexy bimbos, but who should we hire to fill the non-main character roles?


Hollywood:  More sexy bimbos?


(Yes, Patrick Stewart is a sexy bimbo)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look like spykids running around with their apple watches and ball gowns
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like Totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,can't wait to see this movie 👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesnt. Cant. 😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh look, they're still commanded by Charlie ;)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Welcome back kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,lmao that centino guy is here. bye.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s been a minute since I seen Kristen Stewart in a movie and I have to say she looks amazing in this I didn’t know she was that sexy 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY IS NOAH SENTIMENTAL HERE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is this the only trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They need to do a drew cameron d and Lucy lu sequal
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie Angel's Is In 2.35:1
RSUq4VfWfjE,i had to rewatch the trailer bc my dumb lesbian brain only saw kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"miley is kristen 
ari is naomi
lana is ella





oh mah gosh how did i freakin' know?!?!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Since we’re all here, Charlie’s Angels and Full Throttle are on Netflix 👍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love seeing Ellen Degeneres doing an action movie. xD
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“I think women can do anything”
“Just because they can doesn’t mean they should”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Getting Naomi Scott in a feminist movie is like having a conference strictly about women, but have it led by a 50’s housewife who wants to suck up to his man."
RSUq4VfWfjE,And where can we watch it??😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, no. The only look that looks watchable is Kristen Stewart and I;ve been anti-Stewart since twilight. Cant wait to read the bad reviews confirming what the trailer already shows tho"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:16 song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This just confirms that Noah Centineo is in literally everything
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My Charlie's Angels' picks would've been Megan Fox, Kristin Kreuk, and Zoe Saldana. Then again, Hollywood tends to follow the rule of 1 black, 1 blonde, 1 mixed race or 2 whites and 1 minority/1mixed race for some reason."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I haven't heart Kristen's voice since twilight ( i saw her in personal shopper but in that movie she spoke very less) its quite changed
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did we really need another one?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else is getting a Kingsman vibe?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"THERE'S GOING TO BE A NOAH CENTINEO APOCALYPSE👽👽
 watch out, kids..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewert is seriously hotttt
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:37 Those armpits are dirty......arghhhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,when bosley is a she... not complaining
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I think women can do anything"" what time period does she think she is in? This isn't the 50s. Women have been doing whatever they wanted for a long time"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bro in the first part of the video it remains Nd me of twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,I listened to it  .. it sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously?? Now that I saw the trailer, don’t have to watch the movie!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott’s journey : aladdin ———> charlie’s angels 🙈💜
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a lady like crush on Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All I Can See Is Totally Spies Not Charlie’s Angels 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: Wow Guys Thanks For The Likes Or Whateva Add Me On Snapchat - NatDollxoxo & Subscribe To My Channel !🥰"

RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll watch it but I know I won't like it 😔 I want the thin man back
RSUq4VfWfjE,Much better for sure .
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I prefer Charlie's Angels 1 and 2 with Cameron Diaz,
Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Do u hav to ruin the best porno out there
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why the actual duck is this? This looks so bad...
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:00 okay kristen looks so hot here
RSUq4VfWfjE,This cast though???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think it’s AWESOME how they can take a franchise, throw three (four if you include the Bosley character) actors into the roles, and have (from the initial looks of this one) THREE very different, but very well done story baselines. I watched (and loved) the original, was Skeptical about the Diaz/Barrymore/Lu remake, but loved the chemistry between the ladies (including when they included Demi Moore) in every film, and this one doesn’t look like it will disappoint either with the next new crew. Same basic premise but WAY different end results."
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks more like a female Kingsman than Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me : not going watch this movie beacuse of Kristen stewert

Also me : definitely watching this movie because of Naomi Scott and Noah......."
RSUq4VfWfjE,ya have to ruin every movie with kristen ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Barbie spy squad live action looks amazing! Wait-- wrong movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the Charlie’s Angels Theme tune.......
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So how do you find your Colleagues Breath... Just a Simple question.   When  kissng, talking....  Do you felt disgusted or how does it feel... I hope u dont mind sharing :-)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dont call me ""Eng-Eng"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there no asian? Not inclusive enuf.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cant wait to watch this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,All these Angels rock
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is the prettiest person alive I have a crush on her and I'm not even gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who came here after the song don’t call me angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART IS WHAT I AM LIVING FOR. SHE ROCK. 🤘🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know a films gonna be bad when it relays on its music for you to watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah 🤩🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,X sbar nk tgk
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo and Kristen😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,here for Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn't seem like a Charlie's Angels movie... Not sure it will compare at all to the others based on this trailer. November's almost here. 🤷🏽‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like Steward took some acting lessons cuz I'm actually seeing more face expressions than 1
RSUq4VfWfjE,just came here caz of ariana lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks and Naomi Scott....don't need to say more! I'm in!😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,"seems like it will be much better than 00's... much more real and serious (i mean, c'mon, the other was made for horny teenagers and is ridiculous theses days)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dont make it a feminist movie please.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m pretty sure this. Reboot is going to sucks more than a cheap hooker working on a Friday night at Las Vegas’s strip .!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another attempt at ruining the franchise 😬
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi you tell me not to be speechless but I'm speechless gurl what do I do!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait to not watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,#01@d-film of 2019@d
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like it's gonna be lit <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Are you frinkin kidding me???
Doesn't feel at all like Charlie's Angels...
And bosley as a woman????
Hollycrap at it again.
Total flop!!
What a waste of money to make...huge joke...!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie prediction: flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mane ? What are u doing

RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott wowwwwww
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate Kristen being lesbian I Miss the old Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,how is that guy from every flipped netflix teen romance film able to land a role here just. why.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen❤🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sooo Ariana Grande, Lana Del Rey and Miley Cyrus wrote this song to the new movie Charlie's Angels? Have I got it wrong?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tell me wht. Naomi, kristen steward and nalla? Perfect comparison"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry but this remake looks terrible. The three angels look far too young for their roles. Why do they have three ""Bosleys"" in this film? Are the other two decoys or something? Visually, the whole thing looks tacky, overblown and stupid. The theme songs sounds like hot garbage. This is not remotely close to even paying homage to the original TV show or the 2000 film by McG."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All I see is 

Is the totally spies 

Tiana
Snow White
And jasmine"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why couldn't Patrick Stewart just be Bosley. It would've been different.
RSUq4VfWfjE,""" Jane , Are you Flirting ?"" 😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this really charlies angels or bullshit crap remake trying to reboot the entire charlies angels fraternity...doesnt make sense so does the cast
RSUq4VfWfjE,Been my favorite movie since a Kid. I still prefer the 2000’s version
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it only me that i find kirsten Stewart really looks like emma Watson?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am in love with Kristen Stewart ... She is just so charming ... She can make  straight girls fall in love ... Can't stop adoring her... Kisses and hugs from India 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😘😘😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,why was the music/lyrics playing at 2:36 not in the song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wish kristen turns into a girl again instead of a tom boy😭😓
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Disney Princesses 
Snow white 🍎, princess jasmine 🧞‍♂️ , Tiana 🐸"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oof

RSUq4VfWfjE,*Totally spies 2.0*

RSUq4VfWfjE,I think bosley will be the enemy here at the end like from the last two movies of charlie's angels first knox second madison and now bosley .. just a theory
RSUq4VfWfjE,im a straight girl but im more attracted to kristen than noah in this lmao. kristen is just too attractive and noah is just... noah

RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess  jasmaine are  scared
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bangus
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love the old movie but I can't lie I'm sooo excited for this one, too!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wish :
Miley as Kristen - will be that manly
Ariana as Naomi - will be that cute
Lana as Ella - will be that cool"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen finally smiles!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just noticed that everytime a new remake was released everyone were like ""nothing can beat the original"". This society couldn't just stop comparing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm glad Bonnie McKee is getting exposure with bombastic in this soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think they should've put cameron lucy and drew here like for the first part they let you see them fighting or doing their last mission and like u know?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh yea like so cool I mean everyone is sooooo cute and soooooo stupid.  Just sooooooo cool.   LOve these movies soooooo much better than when women didn't have super duper powers.  Cooool!!!  //// RAAAD!

RSUq4VfWfjE,"can someone answer seriously, i'm confused, is this a totally spies live action?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,ugly angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope this movie will not ignite the usual stupid nonsensical  ""view-bait"" controversies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw more Kirsten’s expressions in this trailer than her entire film career so far
RSUq4VfWfjE,passada que as favelas do rio de janeiro aparece kkkk

RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is fucking horrible smh not wasting my time. Sticking to Drew,Lucy and Cameron sorry my opinion"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Even if the film hasn’t even been released i can already tell that old Charlie’s Angels are better than this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Erm ok... this is too sexy, caught me off guard! Daym"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally Kristen does not act like bellaswan
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought the angels were private detectives who got the job done without guns, this is more like a bond movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm Speechless
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If ariana was there she would probably say

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow 👏👏 Awesome.....

RSUq4VfWfjE,did anyone notice the outfits in 1:44?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kirsten dominated,, go gurl"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The girl who plays jasmine in the new Aladdin is one of the angles I just noticed that
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a B grade Bollywood masala movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I still love the old angels <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is totally a secret agent NOT A CHARLIE'S ANGEL hmmm
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why not an all male cast??? Equality??? Oh wait no, everything is in favour for women nowadays."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope one to miss
RSUq4VfWfjE,The review suckssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh I saw you, 2000's Charlies' Angels outfits."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is she playing bosley ...

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Naomi if I wasn't gay before I sure am now
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten was a bad choice
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY CANT THEY BE MEN NEED AN ALL MALE REBOOT FOR GENDER EQUALITY
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I covered DON'T CALL ME ANGEL on my channel, please check it out and let me know what you think 💖💖"
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG when i saw noah i freaked❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here Bc Kristen finally looks Happy! I’m definitely 💯 looking forward to this!❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Snow White and Jasmine quits their job as a princess.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is trying way too hard to get LGBTQ++ Gender fluid liberal SJW racial diversity religious tolerance nutjobs to watch their movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does hollywood keep remaking movies that were already awesome the first time? I really wish they come up with better ideas
RSUq4VfWfjE,That looks shite.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies anyone?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should gender bend their roles
RSUq4VfWfjE,i think the original ones will always be better
RSUq4VfWfjE,not to say it in a bad way but i don’t think kristen suits the character
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seems boring. Nothing beats the original. Alex,  nat and dylan"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love the Old Angel's spesialy Drew  Barimore
RSUq4VfWfjE,yet another bullshit reboot that nobody asked for.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie is empowering, thank you so much for making this movie! I am totally watching this! And Noah Centineo & Naomi Scott is in it, and That just hits the line! I NEED TO WATCH THIS!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh i read it as Charls's angels
i thought he is now making x women Group."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey that's the guy from ""To all the boys I've loved before"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally Kristen's new Movie.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A remake that shouldn't be remade, with too many cut-a-ways for these aren't athletes, these are doll munchkins n who'd believe they're spy, kung fu femme fatales? Kristen Stewart should be happy with most all female cast, she acts like she's always got her mouth full , waste your money people."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish Miley Cyrus was actually in the movie rather than the song. She would have fit one of the angles roles so well
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is hollyweird running outa material?? Another go at charlies angels (3rd)?? Yee gads.....boring. I mean each succession it gets worse. Nothin like the originals!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,And they want equal pay ? Lmaoooooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Og Charlies angel>>
RSUq4VfWfjE,I lup kristennnn
RSUq4VfWfjE,No le van a superar a las antiguitas
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am Turkish. WE ARE NOT ARAB ! We don't travel the streets with camels or sheets. What you see is just women wearing headscarves. They think it is appropriate for their religious views. Please don't confuse us with Arabs. From the outside it looks ridiculous!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've watched it for like 1000 times and really can't get enough of Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why whyyy whyyyyy is this a thing why?! Where did we go wrong?? Just name the damn movie anything beside Charlie’s Angels and it’ll work cuz this didn’t give Charlie’s Angeles vibes anyways
RSUq4VfWfjE,Action doesn't suit girls... these boy things ;)
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only see Noah Centineo at the last seconds 😍 Who else like me?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is just a sequel of Charles retirement in Xmen. Charles Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is disney only adult
RSUq4VfWfjE,"does anyone still know Noah Centineo exist?






cuz i don't."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm actually excited! It seems Kristen Stewart went away for a while and came back with a personality!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who miss the old charlie angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When I saw Noah Centino I was like "" He in this too? """
RSUq4VfWfjE,i bet they  wanted to change Charlie to a woman so bad lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI!😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love love love you guys!!! 楽しみすぎるしょこれ
RSUq4VfWfjE,They're very different from the original characters!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies live-action movie looks great!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing can beat the OG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart just hit that Chinese guy with her cute little hands.. OMG!! 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look At our sultana 😄
RSUq4VfWfjE,when Hunger Games and Pitch Perfects Mix at Once
RSUq4VfWfjE,"meh I don't see any chemistry or characters in this movie, even the soundtrack seems generic"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Nothing but a feministic, misandry propaganda.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't why.. But i think, i like naomi acting."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why the snippet of Don’t call me angel is way better than the original song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oddly Kristen Stewart is the one I'm most interested to see here
RSUq4VfWfjE,So we just gonna ignore my girl Janelle Monae's song at the beginning?!?!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was really excited for this until I saw Noah centineo 🙄☹️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just hope their as lovable as Natalie, Dylan and Alex"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen, marry me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:09 I mean she's not wrong, men, have you seen tomb raider, and this movie looks dope AF"
RSUq4VfWfjE,~~lol~~
RSUq4VfWfjE,I couldn’t even make it though the preview
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is totaly spies 2.0 gen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just learned that there was a new Charlie's Angels movie and got to say that this trailer isn't really impressive. I hope I'm wrong but the first movie with Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore seems way better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Loved this till I saw No one Cent the Mayo.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want a totally spies movie they ain't never think about that
RSUq4VfWfjE,"With all due respect, this makes me miss Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz sooooo much!!! The best Angel yet... At least for me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thing movie is going to be suck, the soundtrack Ariana, miley & lana del rey also suck. Cannot defeat destiny child soundtrack"
RSUq4VfWfjE,let's go lesbian.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am more interested in Janelle Monae's music than Ariana&Miley&Lana's. Sorry not sorry.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen: don't call me angel i was born to be a vampire
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott...from Alladin😻😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Elizabeth Banks looks younger and younger....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Noah Noah.😐
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here because of Naomi.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:25 she looked so much like Emma Watson in Harry Potter
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley is a girl?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Does give that old charlies angels vibes. The old one is better. They surpass the 80s charlies angels, but this one, up to you guys to judge."
RSUq4VfWfjE,ew they use weapons
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love this type of Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a dream come truee
RSUq4VfWfjE,"comment section talking about their looks more than Thier acting or trailer

RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like new fast and furious girl version
RSUq4VfWfjE,mabe just recruted angels?   I didn't feel Charlie's angels like the old one.. am I old????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aren't angels about sass and  majesty? no twillight vibes at all ""GO KRISTEN"" but still..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,totally spies😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"HAMBURG, Germany 😍 0:36"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is a NO! Drew, Camron, and Lucy Lu are iconic and just better I think. Maybe because threats what a grew up with this is for a new generation."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soy la unica que penso que ariana grande iba a salir en la pelicula?
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks interesting. But I'm not gonna watch it. Not gonna watch any Sony releases because of what they did to Spider-Man. There are plenty movies by other companies to support.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I cannot wait, you give me that movie right away <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:15 omg, what did you do to Sven? Pewdiepie will get angry!"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"They really said ""let's make a movie for wlws"" , did exactly that, and I want to personally thank them for it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott🤩

RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angel's were glamorous sexy classy  not these porn star looking women
RSUq4VfWfjE,They hired the whore who slept with her boss kristen? Not watching this they are all ugly
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is hands down the most beautiful one there. How is she so pretty
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does anyone know anyone in the movie before the creating of it? If you do please like .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Perfecttttt

RSUq4VfWfjE,so is Naomi jus gonna come in remakes

RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a pretty shitty movie to me. The soundtrack is nice though.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"okay but nothing will beat the original ICONIC charlie’s angels with drew barrymore, cameron diaz and lucy liu !! this is basically chanel vs walmart and this movie is walmart !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,okay but why even REMAKE the 2000s iconic film franchise in the first place ? this new film is going to ruin the whole franchise !! this reminds me of diary of a wimpy kid ugh...

RSUq4VfWfjE,I JUST SO EXCITED
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss the original Charlie's Amgel😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Theory: Jerry (from Totally Spies) and Charlie merged WOOHP with the Townsend agency to create a new generation of spies after Sam/Alex/Clover retired.
Which would explain why Sir Patrick appears to be playing a Jerry type character with Bosley also being present."
RSUq4VfWfjE,It bothers me how tall the other girl is from the other two. Nagl.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no! Those bad animations: criiinge
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's great to see Kristen Stewart back to making movies after all that has happened 😁😁😁

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boy, don't call me angel💜"
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN IS VERYHING OKEY. I LOVE THIS MOVIE ♥
RSUq4VfWfjE,love the diversity of using a british woman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cheap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can someone like bring the song in it together with all the beats in it cause it sounds way more better in this I hope I'm making sense
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one will ever replace Farrah, Jaclyn, Kate, Cheryl, Shelly and Tanya! Period."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cast for movie should be Kristin, Miley & Ariana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart is blessed with amazing genes.
She can rock any haircut 😍😍😍😍😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Naomi😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, why did Kristen Stewart have to be bisexual."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like its going to be a bad movie just because noah scented mayo is here
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is one of the reasons I'm gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,J'ai hâte de regarder
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:26 for a sec there, i thought it was emma watson"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen can step on my face she is hot hot hooooot

RSUq4VfWfjE,I REALLY LOVE KRISTEN STEWARTTTTTTTTTTTTT !!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer: 15M views.
Song: 57M views."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is bullshit 🤦🏼‍♂️ Women can‘t do this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm...Why do we need this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man, these all female remakes are getting out of hand 😏"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The black girl is so gorgeous 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stewart😍😍😍💕...Her special side🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻💪🏻💪🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why different face please explain?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t like the cast..it could be better
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aw geez another diversity mandated movie with all kinds of gender changing. Geez looks awful.

They are right it should have been called TOTALLY SPIES. Because this looks lame and hardly a Charlie's Angels movie. Probably make money....but it shouldn't."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony this needs to stop please, give Spider-Man back to Disney! As a Spider-Man fan, I loved all your movies, but you had your time. It’s time for another company (like Disney) to have their time."
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:44 is that Naomi Scott In Alladin
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought all the Charlies Angels actresses were *white*. If they were black back then they wouldn’t be white with the new movie, they would still be black. I just don’t understand why you can’t just remake a white tv show with three white women. I do understand because that would be “racist”."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love how people keep saying it feels nothing like the original film's, that's cause it's not. Nor were the original film's anything like the original tv show. Complaining and whinging, the only two things people know how to do these days."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry not sold.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Very hard pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope!  I just can't get past Stewart in this.  She is horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart and blonde hair ❤ woaww😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noahhhhhhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can already tell...
RSUq4VfWfjE,omg didn't know Kristen Stewart had another facial expression. :00
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to watch this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought i was the only one that didnt think it seems like a charlie angels vibe. Compared to the first two films, this seems very off."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Ow! Why did you violently slap that out of my hand?!""
""Cuz some of this blows up""

Logic"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen, I'm ready to be wrecked"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So basically this is how snow white and jasmine together become spies?
😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ayyy  noaaaa,con mas razón la veo .  PDT: vine después de ver don't call me angel :v"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen.. Its kristen steward... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

RSUq4VfWfjE,Bla bla bla the same boring thing
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Kristen Stewart scene looks like a 2019 version of Bella's fight scene in the last twilight movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,High expectation reallyyyy omg can't waittt
RSUq4VfWfjE,finaly a new one
RSUq4VfWfjE,where was Ariana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ight who’s coming to watch it with me

Edit: yeah the movie ended up being horrible, it’s too bad, the soundtrack is the best part"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who's here because he hoped Ariana, Miley and Lana were starring in a new sequel?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Watches trailer*

RSUq4VfWfjE,Never thought I'd day this but Kristen Stewart looked like she uses her face and knows how to for once.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought why the models not Miley, Ariana, and Lana? I thought they would be perfect match if they became the role of models in Charlie's angels 2019"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is here after dont call me angel mv
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one's like the old angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing will ever beat the original! Shouldn't really of called it Charlie's angels

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omg look at that isn't that Bella Swoon  , Princess Jasmine and a black girl I don't know? Can't wait to see it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hoped that this movie is R 13..

RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies anyone?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart was so beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,They're cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can't wait, I bet this movie is amazing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The one with Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Berrymore will always be my favorite. This one looks promising also! 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really? Same old story..eh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Every girl's dreams
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine is now an Angel 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't even know where to begin.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's that sabina wilson😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing beats the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw noah? And yes naomi is badass from being a princess to a spy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for this movie it's gonna be epic
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok im only going to watch this because I see Xavier... Lol.
Ok i really love Kristen here but its freakin Xavier... Lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They ignore Lana's voice in this Trailer, and that's not cool 😡"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart has Shane Mccutcheon vibes here and i'm like 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,This already give me goosebumps!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Peep noah centineo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Basically. Totally Spies meets the Powerpuff Girls. Got it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,K stew? 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is the female version of Daddy🤤🤤🤤🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristenn🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the original song helllurrrrrr?
RSUq4VfWfjE,awful just awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why nobody talking about how cute naomi here
RSUq4VfWfjE,I actually want to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Am I the only one that realizes that when Stewart says ""it can be weaponized"" it doesn't match up with her lips"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im excited. Just watched the last Charlies angels movie with Cameron, Drew and Lucy. Love those movies so much, but Im looking forward to seeing a new version wich has been toned down a bit. The over the top fighting can be a bit much at times."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I remember Totally Spies watching this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here bc of the bad reviews. Now I wonder why exactly they called this bad. This trailer actually kinda makes me excited.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible. Probably going to be the lowest gross movie  of the year
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is pretty. She's really pretty im gonna go cry in a corner now. Like dont you wanna stare at her for eternity? I do.
RSUq4VfWfjE,they've got magneto 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I feel like this is below Kristen stewert and her casting is almost self serving no the popularizing of non binary and gender fluid rather than a genuine choice for the role. I think this is going to be really mediocre, much like the song that goes with it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I MUST WATCH THIS FILM
RSUq4VfWfjE,loved it .. dam kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks amazing ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought Ariana, Miley, and Alana weee the actors"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Sounds like the same Charlie ..hmmmm
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who came here after hearing the title song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,JASMINE IS HEREEEEEEE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Maybe they should have one or two of them as men one bisexual then it would be politically correct aye 😉😉😉just like making James Bond a woman 🤔🤔🤣😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""are u flirting wit the handsome nerd? "" 
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁damn nerds  r 🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This better be worth the hype
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart better on her long hair
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is there any movie that doesn't have Noah Centineo in it? I mean, not that i'm complaining but..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:19 Why does Naomi look so much shorter than them, almost like a toddler"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn’t even know this movie was coming out until the song dropped... they need to push more advertising on this movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine's next adventure.
RSUq4VfWfjE,*crosses fingers* please just be a movie about badass spies who happen to be female and not a drawn out political statement thats all I ask
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ahhh...ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omg noooo this looks bad smh, hell no"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is fucking fire. Always loved her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss you kristen stewart,  i like her character.. She has a personality.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eww! Wouldn't even pirate this. Much less pay to watch it... Swirling turd.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wish the whole ""Don't Call Me Angel"" song sounded like the cinematic snippets here 😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen looks 1000 more beautiful and smexxy here 😍 
But still loving the long hair for her 😘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:45 hey that's clothes from Previous Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew,Lucy and Cameron will always be the iconic angels but I’ll still see this though"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel dumb for asking but who is Kristen?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"jasmine going to be wild, why jasmine??? did aladdin hurting you so much?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"charle's angel should be,
1. Gal Gadot
2. Elizabeth Olsen
3. Melissa Benoist
4. zoe saldana

it could be perfect."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristenn!

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Everybody raggin' on Kristen Stewart, but you haven't been paying attention. She's made some fantastic films since that Twilight dreck. She's specifically avoided the mainstream since then, so doing this movie is going to change alot of people's views of her."

RSUq4VfWfjE,I've always wanted to be one of Charlie's Angel's
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Eli Banks the best of this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ya elah
RSUq4VfWfjE,Очередной бред если честно
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHO WANTS A TOTALLY SPIES LIVE ACTION MOVIE!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's interesting that from weapon and bombs they have a Muslim looking man 😅😅 I'm crying 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This  looks like a disney version but  i wanna watch it so bad  not gonna lie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i came here b,coz of ARIANA"

RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm EXCITED FUCJKKK😭😭😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop incoming
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The original angels are way better they are natural being charlies angel, the act, the comedy and the drama, i felt spark, but to this new version of angels although they are famous actresses well, the trailer didnt give me chills or excitement, but since Noah is there i hope this movie will be fun to watch.
Just saying."
RSUq4VfWfjE,i never imagine kristen being a charlies angels whooff😰 i'm really excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is like kingsmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,I know Noah Centinio and he’s a very nice guy but I can’t escape seeing him everywhere. Why is he even in this movie?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is so freaking pretty.💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why do a remake when you have the perfection that is Cameron Diaz, Drew Berrymore and Lucy Liu in one movie???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lemonade mouth is shaking😄
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like the song better but I like the old movie better
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jerry!? Is that you or am I seeing things? 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lmao this movie gon flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just did an acoustic cover of this lovely song. It would really mean a lot to a small artist like me, if you could just check it out once."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only watch for Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's nice. But i still love the original leading actresses hehe
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLIE at 0:10 .This time he is a Eastern.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So no one will ever talk about Noah Centineo in that movie tho? GRRRR
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bunun bir kısmını istanbulda çekildiğini bilen var mı?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh so now I get it 😂 and the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Makes me cringe while watching it. Trailers lot better than MV. Plus why not give Sir Patrick Stewart credit, he might not be main cast but supporting character and all his previous achievements still should of gave credit."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So what happened to Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Make Me Feel"" is in this trailer you don't even have to convince me anymore, I'll watch this movie gladly! Also, Kristen looks fucking amazing!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen stewart the most beautiful girl what i kno, look weird now. seriously but kristen stewart better look feminime, she have beautiful face, i really excited watch her in snow white and twillight so natural and cute."
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the hell is Noah cinnamon doing in this?

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Naomi are just to die for ugh *my gayness is quaking*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bet this movie will sell a lot because of kristen...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excited to see kristen character here also shes kinda hot and knowing shes gay now makes her even hotter
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wish we had a gender swap reboot of this movie, since it's all the rage and all. I would die to see a Charlie's Angels reboot with an all-male cast, preferably with the Chris Hemsworth, Evans, and Pratt. Pine can be Charlie 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,But guys did you notice Elizabeth banks?? I sure didn't...
RSUq4VfWfjE,MENA MASSOUD SUPPOSE TO BE HERE
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think naomi will carry it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I reallllly wish they would a symbol(as they have in the ratings system) that suggests the trailers might be a SPOILER!  

I realize that the need to ‘dumb down’ everything but what about the others??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Professor Charles Xavier??? Is that you??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh I can't stop goosebumpsing 🤣🔥💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,I believe there are still chances that the movie turns shitty....and the reason might be noah centino’s cringiness......
RSUq4VfWfjE,WoW l LOVE Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is like... the 3rd CA reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Noah Centineo here...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When I heard the song I thought the actresses are Ariana,Miley and Lana."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana:naomi:has a magical voice.
Miley:kristen:queens.
Ella:lana:strong and beautiful.
Who agrees??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Irritating, obnoxious and confusing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously kristen look like 3d character so beautiful 😭💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:13 oh..... she is in this movie. Dislike
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You lost me at Kristen Stewart.

👎🏽"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Algum br??
RSUq4VfWfjE,I missed kristen since twilight xd
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart always my role model, u are always pretty with any style, i hope u can be more succes, i always watch u movie always 💕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This version of Don’t Call Me Angel sounds so much more better than the original. The original sounds lifeless imo.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Amzing

RSUq4VfWfjE,"thinking of another version of Scarlett Johansson, Gal Gadot and Brie Larson...🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I heard the soundtrack, I think it's very bad. Then I watch this trailer, I think I'll stick to the soundtrack."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart should of been Charlie not Bosley...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ofc noah centeneo is in it,,, cause why wouldn’t he be ugh."

RSUq4VfWfjE,y'all had to put mother effing noah centineo just for the shows lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why they have to remake the movie and add total different tone to it? Why don't make the original one, with 4 or 6 girls instead, and create their own character?? What's the fucking problem? Trying to unite 3 generation in theatre??? What is going on with their brain?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,sucks - there is no intelligence
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah Naomi Scott is in this! Boom!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just love Kristen and she looks amazing here! I’ll watch the movie just cause she’s in it ❤️

RSUq4VfWfjE,Yo what’s abella danger doing on YouTube?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They isolated Lana's ""angel"" in the trailer...they tricked me"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I agree Kristen is perfect for Dylan role cuz she’s like Tom boy fr BUT NO REMAKE WILL EVER BE BETTER THAN THE ORGINALS (1976, 2000, 2003 versions) 
Drew Berrymore (Dylan) was my fave angel"

RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ve had a crush on Naomi Scott ever since Lemonade Mouth and it’s still there. 😬
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is the offical audio for dont call me angel so.... weak? like the bass lacks and it sounds all fused together
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lit I use to love this movie as a kid
RSUq4VfWfjE,At first i thougt Charlie’s angels was a mode show
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would watch the remake if I didn't have to see the stupid twilight girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don’t call me angel song brought me here 😜
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What the hell is this, Where the hell is Drew, Cameron, and Lucy ??? Noooooooo no no just nooo"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop smiling when I saw that Noah dude
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dissapointing how the song in the movie trailer sounded much much better than the actual song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imagine how well Alicia Vikander would fit the role of an angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mostly just wanting to know what Patrick Stewart’s role is...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"if Bosley can be a woman, can a Charlie Angel be a guy??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is nostalgic
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have to watch this for Kristen, I'm in love with that beautiful woman. OMG 😍"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana, Lana, Miley: Don't call me angel!

*Elizabeth Banks busting in at the end of the video and still calls them angels 😂😂😂😂*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie lacks the finesse, actors and iconic style the first Charlie's Angels had, with Lucy Lu, Cameron Diaz."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously....... Kristen is so......hot...........😘😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍........love her so much........🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

RSUq4VfWfjE,"“Some of these blows up”

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really thought that Ari , Miley & Lana were going to be the actresses. Now I'm dissapointed☹️"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Love the single... hate the spin off 😵.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omg what is this, the interacial movie of the year? What's going on? And Bosley is a woman? Nooo stop this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So pink ranger is an angel now and green ranger is bosly. Interesting...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reboot will be much better and much more diverse than previous one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why can't Naomi Scott keep her accent?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't get over john luke bacard
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart had me dying
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who’s here after

RSUq4VfWfjE,Song might be more popular than a movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wish the actresses were Lana Del Rey , Miley Cyrus and Arian Grande"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I came here cause of Miley, Ariana, and Lana's track but leaving low-key hyped for this movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't get me wrong, ""Don't call me angel"" is awesome but I feel like my girl Janelle Monae not getting enough recognition here"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The song was posted 2 days ago and the trailer was posted 2 months ago....

All the very best.
Looking forward to it........❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who is here after seeing the ""Don't Call Me Angel"" music video ft Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey?"

RSUq4VfWfjE,This doesn’t look as bomb as the first Charlie’s angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,The trailer of aladin 2 looks pretty weird
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie looks fun. Having no real knowledge of Charlie's Angels, I hope 2:26 is the final shot of the film or the final takedown of the villain."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like por Javi Noble!!! Vamos 🇲🇽 Mexican boy ❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wtf, noah scented mayo is in this too"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen stewart: Hot in every wig she was wearing

RSUq4VfWfjE,The song sounds better here. What sorcery is this
RSUq4VfWfjE,neat trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t like the look of it based on Charlie’s Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I heard Hereditary mouth sound
RSUq4VfWfjE,Action suits kristen stewart.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is noah centineo anyrywhere...
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:55 WHO IS THAT IVE SEEN HIM BEFORE IN THE MURDER MYSTERY MOVIE ON NETFLIX IS THAT THE GUY
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait, isn't that the girl from lemonade mouth?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah that u
RSUq4VfWfjE,All the Sapphics here for Kristen Stewart say “I”
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm going to see this with my little sister, my Mom and my best friend Tony on Sep. 20th. Anyone wanna come with?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Me: Is that Kristen? Wasn’t she just in Crawl? 😱 Great Work!
RSUq4VfWfjE,About damn time!! YESS!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish the Ariana grande Miley Cyrus and Lana del Rey we're playing the actual angels in the movie I mean they're all actors!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love all Charlie’s Angels movies in the past, they are one of my favorites of all-time. I think this one’s gonna be my new one."
RSUq4VfWfjE,gosh this trailer just wont end
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomiii ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally Bombastic with Bonnie McKee will rock
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss old angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,ew noah centinment
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was just listening to Don’t call Me Angel😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"omg i didn't expected Luis Gerardo in the trailer, amazing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Have you seen the easter eggs??!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok I’m all for the angels and the track but how about my girl Elizabeth Banks tho all over this flick!! I love her since the hunger games days goooo LIZZZZZZYYYY aka Bosley 👏🏽👏🏽
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is a cute blonde
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cue Disney intro
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never thought I’d say Kristen Stewart is fucking hot. She’s playing with my lesbian feelings
RSUq4VfWfjE,K.Stew actually looks amazing in this movie...and the song works
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seeing Noah 
Me: screaming ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😍😍😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't care what anybody says they are three women protecting the world and in style 😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Someone took acting classes ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love just about anything Elizabeth Banks makes. But I'm kind of over Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,parece un clásico de Disney
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,3 espias demais
RSUq4VfWfjE,¿Quién esta aquí por Chava Iglesias?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lesbians...ASSEMBLE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this movie going to make me like Kristen?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"coming back to this and realizing that kristen stewart’s character’s name is sabina, almost like her character in the snl totino skit (sabine)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg princess jasmine took a completely different route then😭😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course Noah plays the flirty boy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hellywood always portraying women as masculine like in this movie and portraying men as sissies and trannies, satanic law of reversals."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's here after don't call me angel? 🚫💫 😅❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is definitely catered for 15 y/o. Kristen and Noah would be the only reasons for them to watch it.  I am really over Hollywood's obsession in changing the race and genders of their characters to gain diversity points.
RSUq4VfWfjE,can't wait too see this on DVD!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,totally spies 2019's version
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: :)
Kristen Stewart: I-
Me: im gay :')"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who else came here after don’t call me angel
Just me ok"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why so may dislikes? I think its a interesting idea to bring it back
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen never was THAT stunning.
RSUq4VfWfjE,If I wanted to watch a dumpster fire there are plenty around town and I would probably pay less for fines.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here from Ariana's new song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol they weren’t content with a reboot of what was already female so they had to make Bosley a woman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why was every single bad guy a dude?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see it i think totally spies and Jerry ! 😄♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,HAAAMMBUUURGGGGG : )
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feeling to great to have our beloved Kristen back on the stage!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like destinys child better
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was put off after watching the music video but this actually looks interesting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im seeing more Totally Spies than Charlie's Angels tbh!
RSUq4VfWfjE,When does it come out
RSUq4VfWfjE,I believe it's a lack of respect with Miley Cyrus's trajectory that she's put in second place
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:07 noah centineo mothefuckerss!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isabella Swan is Charlie’s Angel 🥰 if you know what I mean
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, this movie looks like crap!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Pink Ranger and Rita trying to do another project on the side?! Okay 👌🏽 BUT when’s the next Power Rangers movie coming out by HASBRO?!?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's my asian cast :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh sweet heavens, I am so completely here for this movie, I don't even know when the last time I was this excited was. Please, let it be part of a serie *prayer hands*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies 😅❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks wack
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only commenting before the arinators take over
RSUq4VfWfjE,💩💩💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo tho tf
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's like Taylor Swift's Bad Blood in a movie version!❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centipede is in this? ugh fuckin great
RSUq4VfWfjE,"LIked it until the new Bosley, and I love Elizabeth Banks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is only ariana's voice in the trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be SO bad; I feel bad for the 5 people who are going to sit through this garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this is either going to be okay, or extremely bad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,no thx
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is giving some Parker Posey Realness in this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm just seriously impressed by Elizabeth Banks talents, actor, writer, director, beauty..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen😍 Elizabeth😍 Patrick😍 Djimon😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uy no que porquería dónde está mi Lucy Liu jajajajaa

RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally some expression from Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,I kinda miss the original squad.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok, but don't Call Me Angel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Spotted Noah Centineo 2:04
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie was ruined by one actor and one actor only
Noah Centineo has no talent and should not be in this movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is the blond one Hermoine????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:54 el es luis gerardo mendez
mexicoo!! latinoamericaaaaaaaa!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This should be called Dumb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who thinks ari miley and lana should be the actresses in the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am not familiar with either Disney, Mean Girls, Clueless and the classic 90s to 2000s girl themed movies but, THIS, RIGHT HERE IS MY CHILDHOOD!! 😍😍😍 I ALWAYS WISHED TO BE AS COOL AS the original Charlie's angels (Drewberry Moore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu) and my love for strong women came from here!! 

I hope the new generation could appreciated the awesomeness of Charlie's angels... I am looking forward for this Movie ❤❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really wanted to watch this until I saw Noah centipede
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:17 this makes me feel bad@$$ I don't know why
RSUq4VfWfjE,No I am Jane
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally an all female cast show that isn't cringy political propaganda. I'm not going to watch but it seems refreshing! It's still a remake doubt...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I missed Charlie's Angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:29 I'm so confused, do we have 4 angels now or what?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is no one gonna talk about how pretty Naomi Scott is?!?!💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That movie has been partly filmed here in Hamburg, Germany. On 28th November at German cinemas."
RSUq4VfWfjE,aaaaaaaa CONTINUAÇÃO DAS PANTERAAAAAASSSS AAAAHAHAHAHHAAAAAAA

RSUq4VfWfjE,"OH YM GOSH YES LANA GOT THE LAST, ""Be in it, but don't call me angel."" And it just made this WHOLE trailer.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh my Kristen!

RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to be in this movie....now i want to become an Hollywood Superstar with a movie like this hahhahahaha im serious
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For me Charlies Angel mean Drew, Cameron and the other girl, the new girls are just wannabes 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rita Rupulsa (E.Banks) and Kimberly the Pink Power Ranger (N. Scott) are back together.
RSUq4VfWfjE,i find kristen stewart's smirky face so annoying. i dont know if it is the twilight connotation or if i would've felt this way even without twilight.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait... jasmine?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I realy looking foward to new generation of Angels... i love original first angels and i thing i fel in love to new angels <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like Elizabeth Banks here is the antagonist.
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:54 AUG 43
RSUq4VfWfjE,ok but itll never be like the 2000s one
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks corny as hell
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This actually looks fun, like Charlie's angels are supposed to be! I'm definitely watching this with my girl squad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here because of Kristen. I love her😚😚😍😍😊😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We don’t want it .... where’s drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz ?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A LOT OF ICONS IN ONE MOVIE! I CANNOT BREATHE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the Asian girl character? I want to see multi nationality please.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Wack ... the camerion diaz was better
RSUq4VfWfjE,is it just me or is Noah everywhere...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart is hot and she's the only reason im gonna try to watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we appreciate the fact the Noah is in this 👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can't wait to see it, angels!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"imho this looks flat and boring, 0 thrills, where are Cameron, Lucy and Drew? 2000's trailer is much better, -_-"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley is not a man and the main song on the soundtrack is ""dont call me angle""  Hollywood leftists elites are really pushing their agenda"
RSUq4VfWfjE,can't wait to see them
RSUq4VfWfjE,"'Seeing as there's been so many gender swap reboots-'




Charlie's angles: no, I don't think I will."
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is noah scented mayo in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i came in with no idea how Charlie Angel reboot is going to be like. and yes i came after Ariana/Miley/Lana's mv of Don't Call Me Angel. i thought those 3 songstresses are starring in the movie. pop over to the official trailer, just to realize that they are not, but a different set of actresses are spearheading the movie. also, Bosley is now a woman? i remember the original angels with Bill Murray. female Bosley is messing my mind a bit cause i kept having flashbacks of her announcing for Pitch Perfect series. not that Bosley's gender matters, so long as they portray and play their part."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thanks I wanted a live action of Totally Spies for a very long time now !
RSUq4VfWfjE,KS looks more energetic here. Nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dang they really trying hard to keep Noah’s career on the map huh

RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait did Kristen smile in this movie??
RSUq4VfWfjE,More reboots?! Really?! MSN and Hollywood is going downhill so fast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already realize the meaning of this kind of movies ... feminism to power. stinks

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I've only ever known about Charlie's Angels via that one song that was a huge hit in the early 2000's. I have no idea what the premise is or has ever been. But maybe I'll see this, just out of pure curiosity."

RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't freaking wait for November!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tbh idk if I’m crazy about the actress choices for this movie... obviously I’m open to watching it and giving it a try. I just don’t think it’ll beat Cameron, drew, and Lucy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What’s with all the remakes, are there no more original ideas in Hollywood."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song is much better than the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,* SCREAMING *

RSUq4VfWfjE,WHERE IS ARIANA GRANDE??!?!?? ISNT SHE AN ANGEL?!?!??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Come on! The 1st/original Charlie’s Angels were classy women who were able to do incredible things. Then they came out with the movies and made them all look like skanky hoes. And this movie is just more of the same. Not interested. If they done something more like the original series I would’ve went to see it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song sounds more powerful on here then by itself
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow can't wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this actually doesnt look too bad. the casting sucks tho, but i'll take what i can get."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So is this a continuation of the old charlie angels with drew Barrymore, and the other girls ? Or is this just another remake 😑"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can there be a movie where the angels are actually Ariana Lana and Miley next ❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i like that their recreating the movie but the regular version will always be better , but I’m def gonna see this ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This finna be the best movie especially with don’t call me angle
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:37 if the song had this ughhh it would have made it a little better

RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't call me angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,These new angels are pretty whateva but Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo? agora a Netflix foi longe demais
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who's here after listening ariana,miley n lana's track😁"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks so happy and comfortable with herself after the fact that she came out! <3 I'm happy to see her carry herself better in a different light.
RSUq4VfWfjE,seems like a rip off of totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,So bosley is a she this time..cant wait for this movie!!!😆😆😆

RSUq4VfWfjE,probz gonna watch just cuz of kristen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seeing Kristen Stewart makes a wlw die and get reborn at an instant. I love her. jeeeeeeesuuuusss
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't like how they're not the same height and it seems like there's only one that knows how to fight. they should have just brought back the original girls...
RSUq4VfWfjE,If I'm watching this then because of Stewart. Not Kristen Stewart but Sir Patrick Stewart ;)
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music suits more to the movie than the single video.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m so ready
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sadly, I didnt see the Charlie's Angel vibe in the trailer. What i'm saying is the jive and bond of the 3 angels, despite huge differences on their personalities. Also, Destiny's Child song was a trademark, that they should've used it again for the nostalgic effect on the movie. 

Anyways, maybe the producers (Drew et al) would like to create a re-branding and maybe new angle of what the angels could possibly be that sets this apart from the previous movies. 

One thing is for sure, Charlie's Angels by Cameron, Lucy and Drew is a legend ❣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn't know that totally spies had an life action
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who are you?


""I'm Bosely""


um no you're Effie mfn Trinket"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the 3rd Angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought it was ariana, miley and lana to be the angels"

RSUq4VfWfjE,I was excited about this until I saw how un-Charlie's Angels this actually is.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The amount of hate this will get from right wing men is gonna be ""UUUUUGE"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo in a “Non Teen Rom-Com” movie? I must be dreaming.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think the reason why the song sounds better here is because ariana's ""don't call me angel"" has that nice descending melody which really sounds badass but in the music video it's just one note until like the third line"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It’s probably gonna be politically charged trash, but I’m interested in Kristen Stewart’s role. She looks like she’s having fun."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks like Hermiona
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really can't wait!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song sounds better here then on the single
RSUq4VfWfjE,They all look so young.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reminds me of kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant wait.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I came from Arianna Grande's new song 
Have you come too?
  
Like if you hve :)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its look like the totally spys
RSUq4VfWfjE,after the music video im like um why isnt lana and actual angel lol

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Princess Jasmine, Effie trinket and that chick from twilight form a super secret spy group run by professor x to combat political disruption in the matrix"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sonho de toda poc brasileira
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this the first movie Noah Centineo is in that wasn't on Netflix first?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The original Charlie's Angels TV show had 3 super hot sexy women, then we got 3 adequate females in the first CA movie, and here we have 3 dowdy bull dykes. Nope. Gonna pass on this freak show. Remakes are always so BAD."
RSUq4VfWfjE,i want a chinese angels!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I really want to see this. I'm really loving women empowerment in this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,PQP
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love💖 this trailer hope I feel the same about the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist Kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The concept of the character is, whatever happened, the angels always consist of three woman, if one angels out there's must be a substitute.. So in charlie's angels universe, this movie just continuation, not a remake..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Which is worse: the movie or the Ari / Miley / Lana song?

Both awful it seems."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine is at it again
RSUq4VfWfjE,We finally got a blk Charlie Angel yayyyyy!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This doesnt give me the whole ""Charlies Angel"" vibe... Where is Drew, Cameren and Luci?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Huh had no idea there was a trailer for this till now..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Are you flirting

RSUq4VfWfjE,"can't wait for it, seems dope in this thriller"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who's here after seeing Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey's music video (don't call me angel)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,And nobody mentions gorgeous Naomi Scott? Really? Damn...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can we all agree? 
Kristen : Miley 
Naomi : Ariana 
Ella : Lana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,don’t call me angel👼🏼
RSUq4VfWfjE,😴😴😴😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I dont like the song, but the trailer wasnt bad"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is bae 😇😇
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks boring :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,Keusten Stewart rocks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,did anyone saw the easter eggs in the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i hope there's white,black and asian in this movie ☹️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sir Patrick Stewart in this??? I’m so hyped
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's 3 Female protagonist in a action Movie ofc I'll watch this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song sounds better here :/
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is every lesbians favourite movie I don’t care if they haven’t seen it. It’s their favourite.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What I basically heard in this video:
DON'T CALL ME ANGEL HELLO ANGELS ANGEL ANGEL ANGEL"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to watch this so BAD!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley a female in this oneeeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do you have to ruin it by adding Noah Centineo? Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just because Ariana made the song I won't go see this garbage. Ghostbusters 2.0
RSUq4VfWfjE,This remake of the totally spies looks awesome😍😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love the cameo of the 2000´s movie tirolese and SpeedWay costumes...... Thanks. (01:44)
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want Kristen’s character to be gay in this story 😩 that would honestly be amazing to see in a big movie like this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can’t stop watching 2:29 LOL,this is so “in line”with the beat."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The movie will be underwhelming but I might just watch it coz Kristen Stewart looks like she is enjoying a role 😄😉 , Guilty pleasure time pass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles' angels = Elizabeth Banks (why she didn't give any chance to others😂)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*There's anyone notice that Noah Centineo is kinda look like of Mark Ruffalo, when he's talking and in some of his actions such as laughing, nodding and staring is really looks like of Mark. Mygosh. I think I'm the only one noticing it. Sorry.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,*YOU NAMED MY DAUGHTER AFTER THE LOCHNESS MONSTER!?*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Am i the only one who thinks that ari, lana en miley would fit in better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"wow, kristen improved a lot.. im not seeing that Bella twilight girl anymore in her acting!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"if you judge ANYONE by  their cover


screw you"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s more like Totally Spies!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies vibes all over again 😍 hope this movie turns out decent
RSUq4VfWfjE,Plot twist : this movie was made from the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,2000 charlie angel is still the best for me no girl can replace them
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Second time watching the trailer and it looks disappointing.
The original Charlie’s angels looks way better.
Don’t think the new actors has pulled off the characters.
Like cameran Diaz,Drew Barrymore and Lucy Luis were iconic. 
The acting looks bad on the new one and cameran,Drew and Lucy were such strong different characters."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes 😬
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Never thought I'd say this  but  ""Damn!kristen stewart looks really  HOTT!""🔥🔥🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Zuado
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"the soundtrack would be so much better if they kept those strings in, so sad they removed it"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks bad lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,So ya'll really going to disrespect Totally Spies like that by turning a CLEAR Totally Spies film into a Charlies Angels reboot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Both angel's from 00s and 10s will jsve something in common..the massive numb 1 on hot hundred charts..destiny's child made it and so ari, miley and the queen mother aka lana.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks like it sucks.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Haven't even heard the whole song yet and I'm hooked!! So catchy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't care what everyone says, I don't care if the movie ends up being trash or actually something awesome. I'll watch the movie just to see Kristen Stewart dance..lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sadly the present one got no Asian.

RSUq4VfWfjE,"The trailer looks dumb they need to put different actresses in this movie I don't think they are the right actresses for it I like Kristen Stewart but she's not made for this movie or them other two either they Need to make the movie more like the old Charlie's angels, hopefully the movie is better than what the trailer is showing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feel like this is the female version of kingsmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Give spiderman back to mcu please
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks nice I think Kristen is a huge + ... just as Drew was :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,GUYS DID YOU SEE THOSE CLASSIC COSTUMES FROM CHARLIES ANGELS ? Dylan's suit while flirting with that fancy car driver and the yodel dress of either alex or dylan !!! ICONIC ♥️💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Forget Charlie's Angels, it's all about Totally Spies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,I CAN'T WAIT!!!! I love Charlie's Angels so this movie is going to be epic!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crazy about this❗ 🤸🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks as shitty as I imagined when i first heard about it.  Surely it's gonna bomb so hard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why they dont include one of the previous angels like cameron diaz, lucy liu or drew??"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like this version of Kstew, I'm excited for this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,And this is Disney Channel !
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First 'Ghostbusters' , then ' Ocean's 8 ' , and now another box office flop.  I can't wait to NOT watch this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fact of the day; The tall charlies angel is daughter of well known uk chef Lorraine Pascale mind blown
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Não vou assistir o filme, só vou ouvir a música mesmo. (Porque tem a Lana)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait, wtf I thought this one would be an all male cast..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow looks just as bad as the first one
RSUq4VfWfjE,like I thought I was gay but after seeing Kristen in that blonde wig it’s now confirmed???

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boring cast, definitely don’t see Kristen Stewart being a Charlie’s angel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Genius 👍🏻❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nossa! Sidney Sheldon deve estar revirando no túmulo de ver Kirsten ""no expression"" ""Twilight"" Stewart here... Remake of the remake. I'm stay with a Diva Elizabet Banks..."

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wanna see Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu in this movie. (Cameo)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uhhh they changed the movie perspective the old one will prolly still be better
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woah woah woah what is a disney princess doing here?!!? Aka naomi scott as princess jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Absolute GARBAGE
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is such a bad trailer. An example of how bad it is is that they start to introduce the characters and their roles and then just stop. Its going to be a bad movie and I'm never watching it
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:27 the point where Lana's voice just strikes so subtle enough....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m excited and want to see it because I wanna hear Ariana’s voice in the cinema lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,"don't call me angel
alright
Charles Xavier's X-whamen"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i loved both charlie's angels movies, i hope this will be as fun and sexy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow why is kristen stewart so hot?????
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah cinteno in every movie

RSUq4VfWfjE,Someone are here for Naomi??
RSUq4VfWfjE,A lot of you dudes will do ANYTHING to try and play victim. 🙄😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jane is going to be my favorite character tall girls for the win 👌🏿
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop. No one is interested in 105lb non-athletic girls beating up men who would clearly trounce them. Stylized fight scenes with canned slap effects aren't convincing to anyone who's brain is still getting circulation.
RSUq4VfWfjE,noahhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love u kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"more like Cringe angels

""i think women can do anything"" yea, can you cook and stay in the kitchen?..... no? thought so"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"*New movie roles*
Noah Centino: OooOo cAN I bE oNe??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nah... Lucy, Drew and Cameron All Day Every Day!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"are you frkn kidding me, this whole time i thought ari, miley, and lana we’re going to be the angels. smh i’m a dumbass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:06 Rio de janeiro?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Never saw the original movie, just gonna watch this for Elizabeth Banks, Patrick Stewart and Naomi Scott <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is what we DESERVEEEE
RSUq4VfWfjE,"so basically, a really long Audi commercial for feminists"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here for Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok but how have I only realised how much Naomi Scott looks like Lennon Stella...

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen is the one from twilight right? Give a like if ur desperate like me to watch the movie 
↓"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is know a scented Mayo here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,When exactly will they release the song??? I've heard it was Friday this week
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavior gave up the X-Men for a group of female spies =D
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isn't it sexist to be called Charlie's angels? Implying they belong to a man. Just wondering.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just wish I would be able to distinct the angels in this movie but OKAY
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf is he doing here
RSUq4VfWfjE,Issa no for me kristen Stewart has   a personality of a turtle
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Welcome to İstanbul ,ANGELS:)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is fake right? Where are the hot girls?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay I'm really excited about this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Come on I thought Naomi gonna use her English accent . Damn it
RSUq4VfWfjE,A girl head butting a guy.   The girls face would at least be black and blue for a week. A girl punching a guy and knocking him down! Hahaha!  A girl hit me in the face once.... it broke her hand.
RSUq4VfWfjE,If it moves...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey should I be concerned I was told I looked like Charlie’s angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy, Cameron and Drew make this group look like a joke. Especially when you add in the actress best known for breathing and staring intensely as her acting talent. 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop hating on this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"SJW garbage at it's finest.


Try to change my bloody mind."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jane is former MI6, oh and she's 19..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss the old angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Go angel's omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,"vi este este trailer hace meses , volví hoy y aun no me convence ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like this Bosley is a woman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait that's Kristen? I didn't notice
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart actually looks pretty awesome in this film
as a whole it looks awesome

RSUq4VfWfjE,A re-boobs and not a re-boot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Coming soon in theaters november😊😍😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks soooo....yawn...🛏
RSUq4VfWfjE,Make Me Feel by Janelle Monae in the Beginning
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks great but the music sucks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only came to see the part with the awesome Audi
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sucks that Cameron Diaz retired from Acting I would've loved to have seen a Trilogy. So for a Reboot they get Bella Swan, a Girl who starred in a Power Rangers Reboot and a live action version of an Animated Classic and some British Actress I've never even heard of but looks Hot. In my opinion they should've got Vanessa Hudgens, Hayden Panettiere & Michelle Trachtenberg, 2 Actresses I would love to see work together !!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I feel like Kristen will do great in this role....I really like her as an actress, the twilight series was a bit weird tho."
RSUq4VfWfjE,From the grocery isle straight to the garbage... This is a bad product 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think it’s gonna be boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Elizabeth Banks is starting to look like Chelsea Handler!!! I thought it was her until I saw the name Elizabeth Banks LOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cant even hear lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,They better put the theme in it or I’m gonna be mad
RSUq4VfWfjE,2000 and 2003 charlies angels are more better than this Parody Lmfao
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a cringeworthy moive made for feminists and  soyboys.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like ""woke"" sjw propaganda."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Come back Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lui & Drew Barrymore all is forgiven, ""I think women can do anything..."" except make a better movie than some other more talented women they have done already lol."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so COOL!! I'M SUPER EXCITED!
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah centineo's character still a flirt in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,i think the soundtrack will be released when the movie is out..who else thinks that or you guys know that already?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yea yea, skinny girls beating 150kg men...what a comedy. just stop this Rambo copy nonsense, make something genuine."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be a movie that's going to be ruined
RSUq4VfWfjE,Have I just watched whole movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"liu,diaz,barrymore've been angels in my heart. I only see all new angels beautifully, their acts can't compare to original angels, this is reason why i hate all remake movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"More like Totally Spies, but i surely will watch  this!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen can be Spider-Gwen tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I WANT THIS SONG!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes! This is a hard pass for me
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie has been soiled by Kristen Stewart's terrible acting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this is a terrible cast
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reminds me Totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fckkkkk it! When Lana's name came out, I was like Fvvvvvvvvcccckkkkkkkk"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Knew Princess Jasmine was an effin spy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this gonna suck
BIG TIME!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg It's better than ever! :D
RSUq4VfWfjE,If I hadn't been obsessing over Naomi I would've never known this film existed. Naomi is the only reason I heard about this..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here after watching a TheQuatering video to see just how bad this movie looks lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,WIN Dwyane 🎬✅❤❤❤❤❤❤❤✅
RSUq4VfWfjE,"PlayStation is such a great brand, how can it be that Sony Pictures is the exact opposite, churning out trash such as Ghostbusters 2016 and the Emoji Movie?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg bozly is a woman - lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Last was a flop and so will this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Princess Jasmine now gets her side job, huh?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,the problem is that this sequel doesn’t have the hollywood nostalgia i think we all wanted; either way I’ll be in the theaters 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Independent women destiny’s child >>>>>>>>>
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen's  hair style is super cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,seein kristen stewart dance is goin to be everything !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dumb
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ever wonder why so many people are into 70s, 80s, and 90s nostalgia??? Because of movies like Charlies Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah not interested. Damn that hurts because I like Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't call me Angel""

RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sweet but a psycho 😶 Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
RSUq4VfWfjE,We need Angelina/Milla/Charlize  or Scarlett/Amber/Zoe or Kristen Stewart + Jennifer Lawrence + Shailene Woodley
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,haimdeil and the person who played jasmine damn
RSUq4VfWfjE,Me when kristen took off the wig: XDDDD
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN LOOKS AWESOME WITH SHORT HAIR
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eggarly waiting..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody fucking asked for this! The TV show reboot got cancelled and I thought Hollywood might have learned from that already.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss Lucy Liu so much after watching this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"dang am i the *only* one actually kinda excited for this movie--

i can hear the comments now-
' 100% cRinGe >:(( '"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am still learning English, so I would be very grateful if you told me the word that the girl said when communicating with the nerd) he said: I love phosphorus, and what did she answer?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What in the tween content destruction....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks bad.  Poor Ella Balinska, she deserves better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen has zero personality as usual. Another flat character.
Quit acting!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girls power oo yeaH!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm excited for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like another straight to dvd movie release
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally....a feminist wet dream movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,full throttle is still better than this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44  did you spot the girl's outfits from the 2000's version?  nice touch
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A needless remake of a needless remake. While were at it lets remake "" a star is born"" and kill uncle ben and the waynes again. Ugh!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lanaaaa😍😍❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Ariana in the actual movie or song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was expecting to see some more killer fights in the trailer  😒 sad!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm starting not liking this
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be so bad...I love the old ones so so so much and Kristen Stewart actually seems awesome in this but man...looks like crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movies Is gonna suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a bomb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should have been More Serious Movie!!! It's like another Teen movie with makeup, dancing and fighting... This is awful!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am sorry but I cant watch a ""Charlie's Angels"" movie without dylan, nat and alex"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really cool and progressive of them to cast Kristen Stewart as a girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aw man they done messed up the franchise
RSUq4VfWfjE,too much feminism. no way 137 pound females are kicking asses of trained 220 pound males. only in movies. equality lmao. they didnt learn from ghostbusters and from the new terminator lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,excited to see kristen again!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:30 professor Xavier
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope they don’t turn this into a feminist thing. Because I wanna listen to movie without girls being like if everyone was against them because everyone should know by now that it’s not true. And anyone who thinks that I should go to school
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart actually has life and feeling in this. Maybe she can be expressive when she actually enjoys the project she's in.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I find it hilarious that the only male role in the whole movie pretty much, they changed to a female. CRINGE!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is the name of the hairstyle of kristien stewart in the trailer.I know its a pixie cut but what type?plz somebody help.I want to get it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nooo. Captain Picard...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y'all  haven't even seen the whole movie yet and still hate on it just because it's a remake .  Not all remakes are bad . Of course the 2000's movie is iconic but can you atleast give this one a shot  and stop hating on it without even watching the whole thing yet .
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG KRISTEN 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,ohh...I like that
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Feminism strikes again, the only reason this movie was made is to make all the feminists happy with a movie where literally every character is female. 
What the f*ck
It's going to be trash anyways"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi looks nothing like pricess jasmine in that trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gak sabarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
RSUq4VfWfjE,wt actress.???
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m surprised that in the trailer it’s Banks’ acting that seems like the worst by far.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is so cute! omg!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love how everyone is hating on it before they’ve even watched it
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen is 100% that b*tch
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jessica Barden?
RSUq4VfWfjE,For the first time I am seeing Kristen Stewart as a sexy lady. Suits her. 👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,Question?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Highly disappointed that there is not a red head in the group 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is this trailer so bad? I mean, I wanna give the movie a shot because I think Elizabeth Banks is hilarious, but EEEEEEESSSSSHHH what a terrible trailer and choice of a song for it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,with the official trailer. charlie's angels. what to do with Naomi Scott? I have a laugh for Him.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just here for the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes hope Noah Centenio doesn’t ruin this with his Swiped acting
RSUq4VfWfjE,How can y'all say that the movie is already bad with literally just one trailer? I'm sure there's more to watch
RSUq4VfWfjE,As a fan of the 2000's films I still think this looks amazing. Don't consider it a remake of those movies but a new film based on the same series.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart(my Bella) im proud💓💓♾️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im more excited for the song than the movie. 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hahaha wtf is this crap?!? I've seen better framed porno 'shots', who directed this pish? I actually don't want to know who the hack is."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn’t look as fun as the 2000s version
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to watch this movie periodt. i don't care if you guys hate it sksks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll only watch it for Naomi Scott, I don't care about the rest of the movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Also Kristen stewart being a queer icon 3 minutes straight
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is noah centineo doing in every new movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where is redhead? And no asian, who will do matrial arts? Guys this will be so bad :D ""Like"" only for Kristen with long hair  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Does no one want to see it for Naomi, going from independent queen of Agrabah to clutz scientist lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is amazing!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need both movie and song now!!!!!!! (☆▽☆)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not bad . 🔥❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,see what you did with Princess Jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,People will turn into gay at the same time of this premier
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Instead of the movie, this teaser is promoting Ariana, Miley and Lana new single."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like cheesy girl power and I am 100% jazzed about it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not gonna lie I’m kinda excited to see this, but don’t wanna get my hopes to high so I don’t get disappointed"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why am i getting Ghostbusters remake vibes out of this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks absolutely horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like Mary Sue the movie. As a chick I'm sick of these childish ""I don't need no man"" motifs. Guess what Hollywood women will go see subtle sophisticated movies with female roles that don't scream it in your face."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a modern version of suckerpunch
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scot 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is by far the worst movie ever. stupid woman
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should have named it, “Charlie’s Dykes” or “Charlie’s Liberal Intern Twat Squad” or C.L.I.T.S.  That last one was Kristen’s favorite."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just want to listen soundtrack cause Lana is singing it with Ariana and Miley
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am so tired of these impossible female roles where everyday women just easily beat up everyone they come across and murder whoever and whatever gets in their way.  Real tough bitches, yawn, boring... I wish Hollywood would try just a bit harder to use the gray matter we are all supposed to have and come up with something new and creative, you know, something that took some thought. Mark my words, this will be a flop at the box office."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Holy crap. Why does this exist??? I think humanity shortened itself by 200 years with this claptrap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,lana said the angel single will release in 2 weeks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please do not complain, I mean it's not even out yet☺️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rip reply button from 2:26 to 2:30
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like the look of this newly updated Charlie's Angles from the look of this trailer.😁  I will also be looking forward to hearing the new single that goes with it.😁  But of course this is now as it could go the other way when I do finally see it at Cinema's.🤔 Just have to wait and see when the time comes.😊 Can't wait.😊😄😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,It feels as if Disney is producing it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ll probably just watch the movie bc of Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Better have the humour.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sorry but these girls don't have the guts to be Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,not to be gay on main but kristen stewart? *chef's kiss*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this is bad, really bad !!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wyldstyle is Bosley
RSUq4VfWfjE,Reeks of Leftie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was that Kimberly from power rangers?! When did she become an angel?!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The scoring is suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The 2000 version with Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, was so much better it felt natural,they had chemistry and charm.  This 2019 version with the new cast feels like they are trying way to hard!! Should have kept the original cast. NEXT!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one:
Lana: we are in this together but don’t call me angel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott looking so fucking beautiful 😍😍😍. She’s fucking perfect 🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew Barrymore Cameron Diaz Lucy Liu, are the better Charlie's Angels, but these girls do not fill in for the role"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Noah Centipede always playing the same dumb role in every movie??!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is Charles Xavier doing with Bella Swan and Princess Jasmine??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist propaganda.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood: let's remake another movie, but go out of our way to be woke..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are they using Guns? Angels don't use Guns. They only use hands and feet😢
RSUq4VfWfjE,It was only a few years ago they re-did this.  Sheesh!  Hollywood is fresh out of ideas except for James Cameron
RSUq4VfWfjE,"White,black and an Asian girl (she's Indian.)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old is gold..
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks that it will have a lot of amazing action scenes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can they release the song already ?🥺
RSUq4VfWfjE,:(
RSUq4VfWfjE,My fav Naomi Scott 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am so sick and tired of remakes. Can't Hollywood come up with anything original these days?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmmmm  three tough women but um they are still controlled by an old white dude.........uh yeah
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems like there would be less fighting and more talking
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am only waiting for Ari's ,Lana's and miley's soundtrack"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol this looks so lame compared to the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait is that Noah?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am going to see it for one reason 





Arianas voice"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Handsome Nerd
NOAH"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why not you people judge it after it releases?....The trailer shows very less about the story line and y'all are @ it !....What is with you people ?...Trailer shows a lot ,y'all blame it....trailer shows less-yall still blame it...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t even carry about the movie I just want the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only movie feminism can’t ruin, because it’s been the same for so long.....

Time to give em all cocks and balls"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo of all people 🤦🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh...  the cast in the last ones were much sexier.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it just me or rather than Charlie's angels, those girls looks more of a Charlie's bratty teen daughters 😂😂😂😂😂 just sayin though!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"P  a  s  s   ,bring in the next dumpster fire please !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"first hollywood need to understand woman's are not real people ,, they are not humans ,, stop making them great"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I came here again to protest: *""RELEASE THE FREAKIN SOUNDTRACK""*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,is it AUG a3 the gun used by jane in 0:53
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had to go watch the 2000/2003 Charlie’s Angels movies trailers after watching this abomination! I had to recover from such atrocity!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Primero cagasculo y ahora esto.Despues que sigue  los angeles de charlie:el regreso de la loba de  taylor lauther con el cara de portazo de robert patirson
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ESTA PELI ES UNA BASOFIA E IGUAL QUE LA KRISTE STUART ,QUE SE PARECE A DAVID BECKEMAN CON ESE CORTE DE PELO E INCLUYENDO EL MEAO DE GATO.LAS ESCENAS NO PUEDEN SER MAS FOMES Y SOBREACJAJA"
RSUq4VfWfjE,why don't ya'll judge it after it comes out? thanks.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love it😊😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm a  original ""Charlie's  Angel"" fan, Jacklyn  Smith is so so beautiful still,   in her 70's. And I was nine when I watched the show."
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOVE THEM ALL!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If it was kristen Stewart, naomi scott and emma watson, how it will be ????"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so bad my computer now needs to be wiped just to get the smell off
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like it....i will sure watch it on theatre
RSUq4VfWfjE,they’re showing literally whole movie in trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think we have seen enough remakes of this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is taking her back the spotlight she deserve. 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do people see mints and just get that urge to eat them
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks shite
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What ever happened to personality, seems like actors and actresses these days are all plastic as hell with absolutely no personality. Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore have way more personality than these three. I couldn't get into this trailer. I don't know anything about these actresses or what they have played, they don't look familiar to me, but...YAWN!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,People need to realize that the Charlie’s angels from 2000 is a remake TOO!! The original is from 1970’s lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,And now they are making Charlie's Angel with womens ! What's going on ! ...Wait...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie look very shitty and the acting look horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only reason i’m watching this movie is lana <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,anyone here cause of the spiderman split?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I mean I love Totally Spies and all...But yeah, you should've done it  as a TS live action. Just compared to the original and then the first reboot, this may not hold up so well or at all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,hahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's Sam?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart wow!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Abella Danger
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks worse than the last charlie angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is really running out of new storylines.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movies just keep getting worse and worse.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More lame @ss hollywood garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It looks like after Lemonade Mouth split, Mo became a spy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Vallage nai..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo!!’nnn
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm all in
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""From Director Elizabeth Banks""... lol, nope!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,where's the hair smelling guy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idk why but that Naomi Scott girls reminds me of Buffy the vampire slayer/Sarah michelle gellar in this movie. Especially at 2:23
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Niedermer said ""You are all worthless and weak!""...Looks like the same message here except being said about all men.Lame-O another PC crap flick....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"like I do understand that so many people worked on this movie, and the cast is not bad at all.. BUT this trailer is a pure cringe😬"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart got that Carol Danvers haircut
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excellent 😂🤣👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,This gonna be greattt
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Apparently, this movie is ""not... a reboot or a remake of the franchise but rather a continuation that will incorporate the events of the original TV series and the McG-directed 2000s films."" And Drew Barrymore is an executive producer!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm surprised they didn't try to gender swap this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Spider man UCM !!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,They have tried this 2 times in 20 years and both times were bad give up Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love , kristen is hot 😎😗"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The tall girl is so stunning
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well this is gonna fail again just like these feminazi movies usually do. It would be interesting if they could do a Charlies angels  but the dudes would be the spies like James Bond, Maxwell Smart, Johnny English or Mr.Bean and Charlie would be Charlize or Charlotte. Or we could just get a Get Smart 2 film made."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gerry: Goodmorning, Spies.
Spies: Goodmorning, Gerry!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry none of them have same level of Charisma as original casts of charlie Angels.. Original is better.. Even if u compare to 2000 or 1970s version... Still cant beat any of them
RSUq4VfWfjE,I swear this is just another fast and furious Hobbs and Shaw movie plot just with boobs
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please stop remaking original movies. Just make a new one! This looks awful.  And the acting is pretty bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm more excited for the soundtrack than the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,We just saw the whole movie... more animated crap...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I swear if y'all remake one more movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,They could have taken chloe grace for drew Barrymore and sophie turner for Cameroon if they don't have huge budget
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Awwwww.
Charlies Angels got blackerized too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bro, Elizabeth Banks is in like everything nowadays."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think they need to retitle the film as ""Charlie's Dykes """
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks like miley cyrus and Ellen DeGeneres
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen should have been replaced by Margot Robbie. The girls dont compare well to past angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I sure am gonna miss the old crew, but I am kinda hyped for this but at the same time I am not such a big fan of that Noah Centineo actor..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart is a lesbian icon. Giving me serious Chloe Price from ""Life is Strange"" as well as that one chick from ""The L Word"" vibes in this trailer 😎🏳️‍🌈"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Also if hollywood needs some ideas for a movie that is original then im free i have many.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks pretty boring tbh!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to be trash. They should of use three black women for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS is the Charlie’s angels I should’ve had as a kid ❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,so bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Some feminine bullshit right here but hey, who doesn't like Elizabeth Banks?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lesb-.... I mean Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,hmmm. Alex+Clover+Sam?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't forget the Bareymore, Liu and Diaz movies are a remake. Let's not also forget how oversexualised and corny the last ones were too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wheres the fun in this movie
And thats a really weak hair flip"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well it’s already a tiny step up from the 2000 one. No Tom Green 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why Bosley is a freaking women ?!, OMG stop with the diversity BS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They couldve made Lana Condor take Lucy Liu’s position in Charlie’s angel cmon now. Its a no no for me now
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Like I’m sorry but, I’m only looking forward to the song lmao"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t get the hate. Sure it looks bad... but in a stupid, dumb and fun way. I’m actually gonna go see this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another Hollywood Sjw Femanazi produced movie that will flop......😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mantappppppp

Saikooooooo

Emejinggggg"
RSUq4VfWfjE,George Clooney  is Charlie!!!     I WANT MY REWARD!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott. I’m breathless. 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,i’m just here for the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s Forced Feminism
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen you rock
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just scrolling to see if there are any sexist trolls who are anti-feminism haha. What a generation we live in.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley is tony stark from an alternate timeline.
I mean audi r8 
Cool sunglasses
Rich"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, it's been done multiple times, let's try it again."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"there's actually no certain problem with this movie. people just can't move on from the fact that this isn't a reboot, it's a movie that shows the new charlie's angels. yes, nobody asked for this movie but seriously, who asked for the Aladdin remake? or the Lion  King? Both movies were still big hits anyway."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why would a 90 lb girl engage resort to kicking and punching when they can more efficiently Me2 their opponents?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop touching these some of these things blows up... proceeds to throw it on the ground
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another remake failed. Even the antagonistic character “Karen” is making it into Hollywood these days... 🤦🏽‍♂️ 2:35
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People will slate it just because they can instead of just watching and enjoying instead of comparing to other angels movies!!! It’s meant as a stand alone not a follow on, just watch and enjoy- I think it looks fab. Kristen Stuart never gets the recognition she deserves, Bella was years ago and she a fab actress!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I can see rotten tomatoes - 0%.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really don't like the fact they changed the gender of Bosely. Not for the fact that I hate women, but because the Angels themselves are great representations of female empowerment in themselves. There isn't much purpose and it's a bit overkill in my opinion."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Actually surprised this wasn't turned into a t.v. show.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess jazmine became a spy ahhaha just kidding im excited for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WAS IT CREATED TO TURN ME ONNNN???? Damn Stewart I regret EVERY time I called you boring, PLEASE MARRY ME"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"* Missing the opportunity to do a Gender Switch on Charlie's Angels because, let's be honest, that would be really fucking funny *"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The real Angels are nothing like these goofy girls acting like lame women agents. Another waste of money!  Stop trying to remake Charlie’s Angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,why cant charlies angels be 3 guys?..gender swap?..oh does that sound ridiculous?..now you know how we felt about the ghostbusters reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I dont care what yall say, Kristen Stewart looks amazing in this and I'm excited for this movie I've watched this trailer so many times"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott in more comic role?... Why not
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay but if we don't get cameos from Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu I'm gonna be VERY disappointed sksksk"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is in this something gay is bound to happen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What are two of them lesbians and ones a manm ? Lol !
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss the old one .. this one .. is ughhh i cant felt it .. i dont know.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm so offended!!! why aren't the new Angels all male? Or at least 3 confused tin cans, in this gender/object diverse Society. I thought females gender nuetral beings were all for that?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Kristen Stewart actually found a way to articulate her face into expression.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so sexy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Its going to be CRAP, CRAP, MEGA CRAP! 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,tenía expectativas medianamente altas hasta que vi a noah centineo en el trailer ksdksk
RSUq4VfWfjE,Smh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only here for my girl naomi
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll only watch this because pink ranger on here in bella off of twilight in miley cyrus who else
RSUq4VfWfjE,the absolute disrespect that y'all think this could be a Totally Spies! live action remake. TS could never settle for such boring outfits.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gawd - this is a train wrecking into a dumpster on fire while plunging over a 10,000 foot high cliff.  Go Woke, Go Broke, Men get Pussified and Stay Stupid.  I am not sure which is more cringy - this or the nightmare Batwaman trailers.    Farrah Fawcett and David Doyle have to be rolling over in their graves.......  This is just terrible."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood:  We have no more actors and actresses.
Talent room: We can do it.
Hollywood:  No, we shall hire singers! $$$"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i mean this looks like its gonna have absolutely zero plot but at least I can look at hot girls  killing bad guys, I'm okay with that"
RSUq4VfWfjE,man i forgot how hot kristen stewart was.  those twilight movies really tainted her lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wtf men,why dont u show 3 dogs as well?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait who's Charlie again
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want this to bomb very bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What is the deal with all the reboots lately? Can't come up with ideas? Piggybacking off of stories that already exist? Hollywood wants $$ for as little work as possible! Every single reboot is worse than the original, yet they keep doing it. People today are too stupid to come up with an original idea, so they steal other peoples ideas. I am not watching this regurgitated crap!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who do they think they are making another Charlie's Angels sequel after 20yrs? The makers of Spiderman or something? You can only make comic book movies every few years with a new actor! What were they thinking?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mucho mejor que las dos mierdas que hicieron antes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is what happens when you rid Hollywood of of true writing talent.  Rehashed, unimaginative crap. Bring back the gifted imagination of the RH-NEGATIVE people who once made all those wonderful movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen I just can't 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is just brain dead
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another Charlie's Angels movie. Why???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They will never have a Charlies Angels show or movie remake worth watching until they go just by the script. That means a white guy as Bosely, the two brunettes and one blonde hair as close as a twin to the original actor and actresses. Otherwise why waste our time and your money. Hollywood sucks because your fake politically correct is too hypocritical. Thumbs down.👎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,uhm this feels...cheap?
RSUq4VfWfjE,People are so funny judge a movie they have not seen yet 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who in the ""Hell"" thought Kristen Stewart would fit the role?!! The other 2 are hot/cute, but Kristen isn't right for the part. Fergie, Peyton R List, Dove Cameron, Christina Aguilera, Beyonce, Shakira, Britney Spears, and more who the producers could have offered the part to instead."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Again?  
Give it a different name would've been better,  not so many groans from the public"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh im only excited for the single
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've never been more gay in my life
RSUq4VfWfjE,does noah centineo play the same character in every movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have been watching this trailer for 21 times because of the background sound😂👌👌""Don't call me Angel"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do two of the angels look so similar...Charlie's angels are supposed to all be completely different...whatever...this movie will just be another okay basic action movie...and a remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like the old charlies angels and i love the new charlies angels now. Haha lol stop comparing guys. Just watch it on november. 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Reasons why I wanna see this film 
1) kristen stewart
2) i like girls
3) mmmmmmm kristen stewart 




4) ............ noah centineo"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I only get ""be in it, together, but don't call me angel"" and ""angeeeeeel"" from Lana's voice.. why??????"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi scott <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,TOTALLY SPIES
RSUq4VfWfjE,KStew comfortable in a role! Yay!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can see Mrs. Collins fully developed into a true vampire 😂😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,I LOVE NAOMI SCOTT!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,A lot of people forget that the appeal of charlies angels was often how ridiculously extra and over the top it was. This looks like it's going to be just as ridiculous and I love it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,As bayrakları
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still prefer Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone know when the song will come out ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, look a slapstick comedy!
I am sure it will be much funnier than The Room!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope thank u!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who’s here too waiting for Ariana’s “she got her own” release?🙋🏼‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:

Sony Pictures Entertainment: *Here's a Charlie's Angels reboot no one asked for*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Reboot? Fine, the 2000 movie was a reboot too. But an origin story? A fucking origin story?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,We never asked for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Um...are they lesbians?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will give it a go... I love girls in action.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If I needed confirmation that I’m not straight, here it is"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll just stick to The Brazzer's Version
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just dont know what to feel after seeing the trailer. Its more like watching totally spies live action!

Total Flop."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You know why people(men) watched Charlies Angels, right? Not because of the action. lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yay another movie with feminist undertones, you can't see it but i am rolling my eyes at this, BELIEVE THE WHAMENS."
RSUq4VfWfjE,why in all feminist movies they add some powering women pop music. lmao lets go ahead and make charlie angels black men
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nope, thanks. I doubt this movie scores higher than 50% in rotten tomatoes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ugliest Charlie's Angel with ugly Bosbey ever. The lesbian version, lol."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine !! and Isabella Swan !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,another reboot that will fail
RSUq4VfWfjE,I Heart❤You Kristen stewart😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,LAME !
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought its going to be all males charlie. They change ghostbuster to all females.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is out of ideas....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's nothing personal, it's business, called the movie *industry* for a reason, supply and demand."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already like the 2000 version after seeing this trailer. ☹️ didn’t fee enough badass energy. They should’ve chosen different actresses too.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am gonna love this!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want a refund already.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aguante ariama wuachoo
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Some of these blow up""
*Says that right after smacking it to the floor*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Only if they change the title to totally spiez live in action, we may never know."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait😍🙇
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pink Ranger is in Charlie Angel's.. Lol and she's funny! 🤗  twilight 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miley cyrus voice ♥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's not Charlie's Angels without 
Drew Barrymore , Luci Lui, and Cameron Diaz....this trailer already gives me feminist vibes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pinche chava
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah I'm not interested. But I'm rooting for Elizabeth Banks for this movie to be a success.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Big oof. I’m not saying this is gonna be trash. But this is gonna be trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLIE IS SUPPOSE TO E HIDDEN BEHIND A RADIO!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I liked the original Charlie's angels show and the movies with Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, and Drew Berrymore but this.. this is probably gonna fail badly because if the Kim Possible reboot movie (which is kinda like Charlie's Angels) failed then this just might bomb too. But then again, it may not. IDK. I can't see the future but I've been feeling uncertain about all these remakes and reboots coming out (and yes I  have watched more original stuff but it's just that all of these commercials and ads on tv and on the internet have been filled with stuff about reboots or stuff heavily inspired by other movies.... and honestly nothing is truly original anymore so yeah."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"(2019)charlies Angel 
2% action
18% talking
80% unfunny jokes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is every movie nowadays are remakes, just make a sequel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a bad feeling for this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's AUG A3 at 0:53
RSUq4VfWfjE,How if we make a new movie for change. Jesus
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another remake with no originality, the trailer is so long it shows you the entire movie before you see it anyway.  Why even bother?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"did kristen say ""that was just the decoy slut!"" 😅"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie: I need my old Angels back!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder if 'Creepy Thin Man' is still there...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imagine the main villain in this is the old angels🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,مـمـگن آسـمـ آلفلمـ بآلعربي
RSUq4VfWfjE,never gonna beat the original(not a big fan of the original still)
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only came here to hear the little part of Lana’s voice at the end lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Woman can do anything. Apart from be bad guys, apparently."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is Totally Spies..  Not Charlie's Angels...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know, but i think these actresses will never deliver the extraordinary performances Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore gave."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks meh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage. Not like the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have to admit, I never thought of kristen stewart as being particularily hot. I mean by all means, she's no uggo, but they actually managed to make her look hot! or maybe it's just because she's smiling for once xD"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is so cringey. twilight chick as a dikey blonde lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,"SOO BAD.. OH SO CLICHE, OH SO *LAME* ... OH SO SJW... OH SO LEFTIST...... OH SO GAY.....  TIRED OF THE GAY CRAP."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Snow White and Jasmine together... Nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,Older angels were way hotter than these ones.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be so much fun!!!  💕💖💕😆 thank you Elizabeth Banks and team!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No shade but Lucy liu did a better hair flip sis 🤭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks extremely hot in this. I'm going to see this just for her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im so excited!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now their going to say ""iT's PrOgReSsIvE"" because there is a ""black"" woman in it. Racially ambiguous women are not the only black women who exist. If her hair isn't curly and she isn't unambiguously a nubian queen, i don't care.


BUT THAT SONG WITH LANA, MILEY AND ARI BOUT TO BE FIRE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angels gone cheesy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only reason this trailer looks interesting to me is because of the catchy song and Kristen Stewart. She looks so badass and the haircut is dope. But I see a lack of chemistry between the Angels compared to Cameron, Drew and Lucy's version. Though it's just the trailer so it may not be right to compare. 

People should let go off their nostalgia glasses. The 2000 version was not some classic. This will definitely be better than the full throttle crap. If not anything at least the action will be better than previous versions which haven't aged well at all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No, just no"
RSUq4VfWfjE,why does it seem weird when i see professor x walk once again
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Feminism has no sense of subtlety these days, does it?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No. Enough.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When Princess Jasmine being a pro spy.

Disney: A whole new .......... Speechless

Sony: Gotcha"
RSUq4VfWfjE,yuck
RSUq4VfWfjE,I got hard watching this 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did i just get bored from watching a trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waiting for this movie ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, there goes my sexuality"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh. No
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels is an American concept, the three main stars in this film are not American sorry but F this film, can't, won't be seeing this shish LOL just saying"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to not see it...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"* sees kristen stewart *
**screams in gay**"
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I’m seeing a bunch of hate comments. AM I THE ONLY ONE EXCITED ABOUT THIS???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hmm looks like a charlie's angel's for young adults...what happened to the original movie, i don't even find them attractive...and really Aladdin girl is in this? I'm so sad, i loved the older moves."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I say the cast should’ve been Naomi Scott, Nina Dobrev, and Zendya"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks like she might have a personality i gotta see it 😳😳
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female Bosley = yet another progressive movie fail that the box office will reflect.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lesbian Kristen is the queen Ive been waiting for
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks BADASS. Y’all mad for no reason.
RSUq4VfWfjE,very action
RSUq4VfWfjE,beautiful girls
RSUq4VfWfjE,Has anyone seen it? Is it worth watching
RSUq4VfWfjE,When this song is coming
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No. Just NO. 😂

Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu will always be THOSE BITCHES. ✊🏻♥️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uhm three of the actresses look just the same??? (Speaking:two angels and the ""damssel in distress"")
Loved the 2000...between other things for the three very diferent personalities and backstories..and prodigy..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Gay for KStew*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh but no Asian? :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought that's Kate McKinnon at the start
RSUq4VfWfjE,It just takes time !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If Drew Barrymore, Cameron Díaz and Lucy Liu are not in the movie .... I don't want to see  it -.-"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm going to see it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Guys it's finally happened. Noah Centineo is finally on the big screen 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot wait to watch this feisty film!  It will not disappoint anybody! I am sure!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Despite the comments I’d see it I’ve always loved Charlie’s angels since the 2000 and 2003 Charlie’s angels it looks dope if you aske me🤷🏾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristeeeeeem
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only gonna go watch this to hear Lana tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The previous movies had a comedic vibe to them, so whenever anything was stupid or ridiculous it was ok because of the vibe. But this one takes itself too seriously, making the silly stuff feel cringe. Also charlies angels are all about charisma. something that is seriously lacking in this cast. none of them are memorable of interesting. As generic as it gets."
RSUq4VfWfjE,uh uh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is😛😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is so stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels was my fave movie as a child and now they're ruining it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY TF IS NOAH CENTIMETER IN THIS????
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Handsome nerd ughh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf? Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin looks incredible in this movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gag a maggot!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,love ari i really do but nothing will beat Independent Woman pt1
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've never seen so many facial expressions on K. Stewart's face.. Impressive.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I AM SO. EXCITED.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Zendaya should've been in this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Loved it until i saw Noah Centinio
RSUq4VfWfjE,it isn’t even bad y’all just like to jump on the hate bandwagon
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels did not use gun. Which heaven are you from?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow amazing trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there no blonde?? I need a genetically blonde woman who is a badass and not a disney princess.
RSUq4VfWfjE,how has this gotten 130k likes?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi is gorgeous🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another remake that I will not spend my hard earned money on nor my time.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This doesn't look bad tho.ppl just like to complain and can't let go of their nostalgia of the original😂😂😂 I'm gonna watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why everyone have to Judge the trailer even when the move hasn’t come out yet? Have you ever listened, don’t judge a book it’s cover? So it’s same like a movie,
don’t judge a movie by
it’s trailer or the actors who play in. Omg you netizen are so fucking annoying."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont like it. sadly.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just wished they make Charlie's Angel with the original characters. And how they are becoming rusty of the job or something. Not a reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wank
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You all have to admit, Kristen Stewart is HOT!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already know I want a second movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Quick question...why is the King of okay/bad Netflix movies, Noah Centineo, in this movie???🤦🏾‍♀️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“Oh no, I should’ve been more careful for what I had wished for.”- jontron"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only reason I like this is cause of the song. I’m ready for it to be released
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait, is that the girl from Aladdin and the girl from Twilight in the SAME MOVIE?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,it's about time Hollywood made one of the angels a man 😏
RSUq4VfWfjE,"To all the people bitchin about this film........""Keep your pretty mouth shut."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm ready for this fucking song to come out
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for my girl kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just gonna see it cuz I'm bored
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?!?!? Who the hell asked for a reboot to a remake of a movie from 2000?!?!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naah they can't beat the original Charlie Angel's... This remake is going to be okay not more than that. Old one is far better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,wait is that noah !? fck it is noah!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everything was perfect until noa centimego came
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm a fan of the original charlie's angels but, I loved this too. I don't understand why others just, don't."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only thing I'm pissed about is that they didn't use the original soundtrack
The trailer felt kinda messy too"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like It folks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where IS Mamrie Hart?!?! The Pun-Appropriate bartender?! She can be the older comedic relief woman (early 30s) who shares her story and tries to shed light for her younger cast. Maybe a reference to MySpace?
RSUq4VfWfjE,m literally seeing princess jasmine shooting guys so cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,"edgy...but cast chemistry is spot on...can't wait to see the action shots and adventure. cause lets be honest, most of the spy movies have the same stories...or plot...just different executions.

whats fascinating is how the roster can deliver. because a movie can only go so far with the story."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ooommmmmggggg
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I LOVE how everyone is getting so angry when comparing the 2000/2003 Charlie’s Angels movies to this trailer.  Those were cheesy, fun, light movies. They were not works of art. Calm down. I’m sure this reboot will be just as fun and girl-powerish with an updated feminist view to meet the times. Stop taking it so seriously. 🙄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A disjointed, confusing trailer we have all seen the likes of a million times.  Except now there's a cast of ladies who most of us have never heard of, trying to be something from the 80s with a modern spin, that was already done not very long ago.  I do understand and support the need for positive strong female role models in today's society, but that is no excuse for lazy writing, horrible trailers, and a retread of a retread of a retread.  This could have been so much better had it been under a different title and had a coherent trailer that didn't spoil the entire movie, and left us a few surprises.  Bad form Hollywood.  Bad form."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's already extremely bad. Perfect choreographed moves that are impossible in reality. Pure fantasy with the star of the movie being the guns they shove in your face. Because while innocent people think this is 'enterainment,' it is nothing more than nonstop advertising for guns and violence. The military industrial complex is behind all this programming. Mark my words. ""Guns are cool."" ""Everyone should have a gun. Buy them. Own them."" These military corporations are in bed with Hollywood. Anyone who cannot see this is not looking."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cannot believe I am going to say this, but it is going to blow my mind and leave me completely speechless from start to finish!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"damn that was like watching a rollercoaster that sorta started out ok, gradually got creakier and then just fell apart when noah centineo came on eek"
RSUq4VfWfjE,... :/.  I’m sure girls will watch it...i guess...
RSUq4VfWfjE,O my.. ewww is all I can say
RSUq4VfWfjE,Opening of the trailer reminds me of Taylor Swift's Bad Blood music video.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is going straight to ASDA for £5, second isle, near the toilet brushes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I liked the previous movies, maybe when it comes to red box and I'm bored"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait wait they just SNUCK NOAH IN WHAT IS THIS MASS POWER!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 where you see old angels' wardrobes!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah centinio and naomi scott are my favs!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here jst for lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It reminds me of 
BARBIE:spy squad"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s gonna be bad unless they pull off a cameo of the original Charlie’s angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Holy crap she can show emotion?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watching trailer again for the song. Anyone knows where the official song is released
RSUq4VfWfjE,It comes off a bit like Totally Spies but I definitely want to see it!  And the Ariana/Miley/Lana song sounds like it’s going to be a bop!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol the first thing I thought when I watched the trailer was...... When did bella learn how to use a gun XD
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who else keeps watching the trailer for the new Ariana, Miley, and Lana song?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The assault of Femenism is in full effect
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot wait to see this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Must watch . Omg my fav kristen and naomi 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:12 what is song??😭🥺
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier isn’t dead
RSUq4VfWfjE,The new less charismatic Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m more excited for the Charlie’s Angels song. Miles Cyrus. Ariana Grande. Lana del Rey. LIVING.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like they are trying to make a Charlie’s Angels version of the Kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here to let you know that I never dislike any videos on YT. This is my first time. Thanks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have never left a movie when I have gone to a theatre, with one exception.  Charlie's Angles was only movie I have ever left after paying for a ticket.  It was horrible.  I do not think I even got to the halfway point in the movie.  I am at a doctor's waiting room and this horrible movie is playing.  If the first one was not enough, there was a second movie I never bothered to watch.  Now it seems there is a third with the title of the first.  There should have never been a first.  I think the Americans have a saying about beating a dead horse.  Well, it looks like the makers of Charlie's Angels are beating a rancid horse, bloated with methane, dripping with maggots, carnivorous beatle larva, worms, and smelling like roadkill."
RSUq4VfWfjE,But where's The Rock?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks super fun! Can't wait!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pathetic reach for re-make. Kristen =disappointment.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Description: don't judge a girl by her cover.

couldn't even come up with an original description sony pictures?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is captain Picard in this???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it weird that I'm unironically into every aspect of this and really, really want it to be great despite everything screaming at me that it won't be?

... yes. Yes it's weird."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watch the trailer for the kitchen, it looks much better"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is 2d or 3d
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why everyone keep bitching about this trailer because I don't see the problem.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are you sure this isn't a. *Live Action Totally Spies Movie.*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awful.....just awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ooooo so excited for this yass
RSUq4VfWfjE,"NO GENDER SWAP INTO MAN ????

SJWs HYPOCRITICY.🖕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:07 is Noah Centineo right? 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least Patrick Stewart isn’t reprising his role as a animated Turd
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate to say it but I will be watching this for my girl k stew and pretty much no other reason.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hard pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is that Noah Centineo? Welp, I know where this movie is headed."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would never watch this. You can only make this movie so many times with different chicks. The last time was it for me. How about something original then making another remake. kristen needs to move on.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jasmine what are you doing girl?

Or should I call you the pink Ranger?

Or maybe the girl from lemonade mouth?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously? We're rebooting Charlie's Angels AGAIN? Couldn't they at least pick better actors for the angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course Noah Centineo is here! 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes yes yes yes yes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm going to go see this just to look at Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh.  Doesn't look much like a Charlie's Angel's movie.  Probably should have went with a different title.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wishing Kristen all the best for this movie she looks awesome and the role suits her. 😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Long hair even though its fake..love it.. Kristen 😍😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does everything have to be politically correct now a days?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fans: .........
Hollywood: We need remakes people
Fan: Can I be a writer for you Hollywood
Hollywood: is it a script for a remake?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,FIRST.FEMALE.DIRECTED.REBOOT. LET IT HAPPEN.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Happy to see Kristen Stewart in this RoLe. Perfect . 
But, in my opinion.. This not Like "" CharLie's AngeLs."". 
This FiLm, just Like CIA or FBI Agents, with those Big buiLding with Crews, CooL Stuffs, Guns. 
Maybe. Just Like Another fiLm about Agents who wants to Stop the InternationaL War. CharLie's AngeLs maybe shouLd be ""secret agent"" . Maybe.
It just My Opinion.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here after Kristen's vanity fair interview now I don't know what to do before this comes out!!!  Yess!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope Shia Labeouf makes a cameo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missed Chameron Diaz😢😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,damm Stewart Hair  loved it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten smiled!! OMFG
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, these ladies are *hot* !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The amount of male actors is  huge and they decided to choose noah are you gonna squirt now for dis amazing movie :))))))))))))
RSUq4VfWfjE,So now we all know what Princess Jasmine decided to do after the whole Jafar fiasco.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can Elizabeth banks stop producing movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh brother, I got to one minute of this trailer and yanked it...who approved of this crap?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So they gonna act like they didn’t steal the scene where he slaps the mints out her hand from kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,“I LIIIVVVEEEEE.”
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now this looks fun!
RSUq4VfWfjE,When is this song getting released?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I LOVE YOU KRISTEN STEWART💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do I feel like this might compete with hustlers
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I ever wanted to be was an angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will watch for the simple fact I never get tired of looking at Naomi Scott.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looking so trash omg , hollywood is dying !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aren't ""Charlie's Angels"" supposed to beautiful?   Kirsten Stewart?   Really???   Naomi Scott isn't much better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart dancing yes!
RSUq4VfWfjE,im down
RSUq4VfWfjE,"THIS IS DISRESPECTFUL, WTF."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Destiny’s child is right name.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No.. just no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks ok I think but the 2000 film was way better
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another special agent movie..... feminist edition
RSUq4VfWfjE,imagine if Ariana grande Miley Cyrus and Lana del ray played Charlie’s angels!! 😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart shite actress movie looks destined to flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It does not matter is it's a reboot.  What matters is that movies today are like music videos: nothing brilliant, nothing clever...just motion and eye candy.  The women, men and sites are all effects.  They don't need to find talented people and great plots.  You just advertise...get people in the theater."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin's facial expressions are truly alien. She's trying to smile but you can see something unsettling in her eyes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks a bit sjw. But still looks not bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok but where’s my gurl Lucy Liu, 
with my gurl Drew, 
Cameron D and Destiny
Charlies angels, come on 
Uh uh uh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Maybe this could be much more interesting if the new trio are the now kids of Alex , Natalie and Dylan."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to pick this up on VHS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is like my First seeing Kristen Stewart Smiling
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I Never asked for this"" 
Everybody on planet earth"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The trailer makes it seem bland to be honest, but I hope the film turns out to be good."
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boooooooooooooooooooooooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart was so beautiful w/hair 😢
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we have a deepfake of Farrah Fawcett in there? And literally like the rest of the previous angels in there
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need the song please give me a link
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Elizabeth said “I’m Bosley” my whole body was just like “Yes. Yes.”
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is that the first thing I though when I saw this trailer was totally spies lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,stop filming this and make another muppet movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,complete trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hard pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:08 QUEEN MILEY YAAAAS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Honestly they should've just continue MCg Charlie Angels films
RSUq4VfWfjE,When's the music coming out?
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Bella lie...she not stay forever with Edward....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Same closet in kingsmen also
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo doesn't fit in this at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else is going to watch this just cause they are hot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The black actress is 22, yet was somehow former MI6? Maybe she was fired after one day in the MI6, which would explain why she now is fighting crime with Kristen Stewart."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wouldn't it be like Totally Spies? Like the fourth angel in this movie like Britney who teams up with the real life versions of Samantha, Clover, and Alexandra. 🔎🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another shitty remake no one asked for. Can't wait to never see it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks starring, directing and writing the film? She must be like Tommy Weisu"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All I’m going to say is the 2000 one with Cameron Drew and Lucy is Better I don’t even want to watch the 70s ones cause one all the third girls were white but the 2000 one was much better we had a red, blonde,brunette"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why most people here are soooo pessimistic?!! Chill. Just don't watch if u don't want to. World doesn't ONLY revolve around you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least the music is kinda catchy
RSUq4VfWfjE,AOC and the squad hit the silver screen!?!?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only one missing in this movie for a guaranteed 💣 is Demi Lovato, nevertheless, Kristen Stewart should do just fine crashing it!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Epic Fail.
RSUq4VfWfjE,is that Bonnie from vampire diaries 😂😂👍🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,emma watson twin

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Do y'all realize that 2000s angels is a remake too? Lol
Everyone has forgotten the original series"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The 70s Charley's Angels were mind blowing.  Three gorgeous women were detectives as an opposing from the housewives, secretaries, rich wives and blue-cross girls.   Detectives were always men.  And, now?  Same old boring run-of-mills spies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart's come far since Catch That Kid
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where have I seen this exact same thing before? Oh, yeah, I remember now. ""Mission Impossible""; ""Kingsman: The Secret Service""; ""True Lies""; every ""Bond"" movie ever made, and the other ""Charlie's Angels"" movies; just for starters. Hey, Hollywood, you're boring me into a coma! You suck!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bad casting, worst attempt. It made me aka any Charlie's angels' fan weep."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't make me laugh! Come on Hellywood you can be better than this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not even Lucy Lius famous hair flip can save this flop😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,WOW... if women are so all knowing all powerful & perfect why are they still following stupid religions created by men
RSUq4VfWfjE,"nothing against banks, but i wish Bill Murray was back as bosley :("
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This shouldn’t be called Charlie’s Angels, this should be called Totally Spies 2.0 because it’s because this movie is nothing but a cheap knockoff geared over to kids and the SJWs/Feminazis 😒😒😒🖕🖕🖕

*And don’t try to start a war with me in comment section, allow me to feel what I wanna feel*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The trailer emphasises mostly on the casting with Elizabeth Banks and From Director Elizabeth Banks, as if she's a well renowned Director in the industry. Or an actor if I'm honest!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just bec elizabeth banks has a personality doesnt mean the angels dont need one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only thing I’m excited about from this movie is the collab
RSUq4VfWfjE,"love the reboot, hate the logo"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did u mean charlie angels Believe
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another reboot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sure they are great actors but they are average looking to me.  The original angels are sooooo hot!  All of them and they can act.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for Lana del Rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart couldn't push a door open with those twig arms, let alone take down a grown man."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am woman....hear me roar! I can't wait to not see this movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the hot Asian woman ? Fail.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope cameron diaz, lucy liu and Drew barrymore shows up surprisingly in this movie. I would literally scream for realz. 😭😭"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,This would have been better as a Totally Spies live-action
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh dear! No thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,You are now watching the Disney Channel lol 😂 🤦‍♂️ this is going to bomb 💣 so hard lol 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,old is gold
RSUq4VfWfjE,But why didn’t the use the Charlie’s Angels theme....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm happy to hear the new Charles Angles now
RSUq4VfWfjE,I NEEEEEEED THE SONG ALREADY
RSUq4VfWfjE,"what?? No!! we want Lucy liu,, Drew B,, and Cameron Diaz.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dillon warned us lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where’s Lucy, Cameron and Drew when you need them"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So disappointed
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had a crazy dream vision fiction idea that would possibly  happen in film real life someday. Charlie's Angels and Totally Spies from animated cartoons crossover team up.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't call me Angel"" they said. Ok then, how about Charlie's Thugs?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is also the writer ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Some remakes are unnecessary...and this is one of them.
RSUq4VfWfjE,so ..this looks like its trying to be charlies angels but more like going to The Powerpuff Girls side..with that feminist touch..thats goin on right now to spice it just a lil bit...fuk this crap...i even prefer to watch another drew barrymore sequel of charlies angels or whatever if i had no more option..than this thing
RSUq4VfWfjE,so ..this looks like its trying to be charlies angels but more like going to The Powerpuff Girls side..with that feminist touch..thats goin on right now to spice it just a lil bit...fuk this crap...i even prefer to watch a drew barrymore sequel if i had no more option..than this thing
RSUq4VfWfjE,Almost makes me want to watch Star Wars 9. Almost.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Awful , there’s no words to discribe how bad this movie looks"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What’s with the stupid logo
RSUq4VfWfjE,okay but the soundtrack is gonna be fire
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ve seen the original Charlie’s Angels movies when I was a kid...but I’m not interested in this one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Alright. After listening to the music in the trailer a few dozen times, it’s growing on me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grade ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew, Cameron and Lucy were great in Charlie's Angels. There's no need for a remake."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo 😐
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh great it’s ghostbusters 2016 all over again
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope... Going to fail badly...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Leave trailer I am excited about the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yayyy diversity!!



Not... I liked the old one. This seems contrived."
RSUq4VfWfjE,wtf is this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hai charlie's angel.😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If you want a newer Charlie's Angel...do it with more mature women. Elizabeth should have been one of the Angels instead of Bosley. Miscasting on this on all levels. Sorry, this should have been a different. 
Invest in a sure fire, I would have gone with another Spy movie  with Melissa McCarthy and Jason Strathom. They were genius in their comedic dialogue together. I watch that movie everytime, it's on. I am just waiting for my husband to buy it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie Angels 2019 ? Owh I don.t look Asian actres There .
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this looks so bad, in 2019 & onward you can't do justice to older shows/movies because their era's freedoms are what made them what they were/are...just stop now and continue down the path of SJW sensitive movies so everyone feels the same and everyone stays (un)comfortably numb...no matter how hard Hollywood tries they'll never erase why the past is so much better than the present/future in terms of entertainment (music too, jeez, there's a reason why everyone tries to replicate the music from 1980 to 1998....anything & everything after is awful)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kanus a ni mugawas s SENIHAN 😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks like she’s actually having fun with this role
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hay quá
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizibath blanks is a badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,💕💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,HASIL DULOT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im fucking crying that’s how happy I am 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART IS THE BEST ACTRESS THAT I EVER SEEN.. SHE'S THE BEST
RSUq4VfWfjE,Welcome to the world of millennials.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just another reason to kick the jews out.
Again."
RSUq4VfWfjE,See we don't need to change 007 to a female after all
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't know what to think about this. The original angels is iconic
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else cant wait for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It is very interesting that so many people are commenting on having liked Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu. I enjoyed those films as well. However, it seems no one in the comments section here are the least bit familiar with the TRUE original ""Charlie's Angels"", Farrah Fawcett, Jacklyn Smith, Kate Jackson, and Farrah's character's sister played by Cheryl Ladd, etc.. It's as if today's people don't even know the original show existed at all. Sad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 👌🏿
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I got excited because it got 12m views. 





 *the trailer sucks*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noooooooo way
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:50 I feel like I saw this exact scene somewhere (coughs) Kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did i just watch the whole movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Right then, great trailer but I sure dont need to see the film now! So it's a remake, gotta be better than yet another Marvel film surely?! 😯"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Since a lot of traditionally male roles are being recast with females, when will we get an ""All Male"" Angels Angels? This movie is SEXIST!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait, where's the Charlie's angel theme song??? Don't name the movie ""Charlie's Angel"" if u dont have their theme song, smh😑"
RSUq4VfWfjE,garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Has anyone noticed...no matter how badass the female protagonist, there's always going to be a huge closet/splurge/makeover part. As to say: we challenged your sexist cliche, here's a super powerful woman! But here's a fun girly moment. Otherwise is just a manly action movie with added sass."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does Hollywood produce original movies anymore?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hard pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG! Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You know, as much as I *sigh* about another rebooted/sequel movie and wish they would just make a new and original movies.

The problem is they most likely can’t, they have all this IPs that they need to utilize (don’t crucify me for this) I believe I read somewhere that if a IP hasn’t been used for a certain amount of time it becomes open source like Lovecraft. And add to the fact that original movies don’t get butts in seats as much as sequels or reboots do. Hollywood is a business and they have to always keep making money and I’ve just come to respect that."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is lanaaaa
RSUq4VfWfjE,Na this looks like Captain Marvel. No thanks and honestly wtf with this anyway ok I'm coming to up with stuff for you guy's to use i mean come on.
RSUq4VfWfjE,With all due respect I think Jon Favreau could have been Bosley
RSUq4VfWfjE,Inclusions Angels! Lolx10 this movie will flop!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Estará en Netflix?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The cast seems shite. I don’t wanna see a random I wanna see a celeb
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was the only guy on earth that was actually entertained by the Liu, Bmore, Diaz ones but this looks awful even though I'm a fan of the actresses. Making Bos a woman?! id rather watch Ghostbusters 2 or Ocean's 8 part 2 or Star Wars FA"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"angels ariana, miley and lana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It looks delightfully awful, can't wait for the CinemaSins episode"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Guy: ""Stop the touching because some of the stuff blows up."" Also the guy: *smacks explosive out of her hand*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:27
 tho"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was anyone going to tell me that Noah Centineo will be in this movie or was I about to find that out myself while watching the trailer?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,QUEENS!!! STUNNING!!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO DIE EVERY TIME KRISTEN STEWART IS ON SCREEN. ME AND MY FELLOW WLW ARE COMING OUT TO WATCH THIS!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now this is called real magic

RSUq4VfWfjE,this Charlie's Angels is going to be the best of them all!!❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this look garbage?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They have a female Thor, time for a male ""Angel"" bet that would piss sjw off!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,turkey is not arap.i wish sony pictures should be know it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,no one can beat Bernie Mack's Bozly
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love the original angels but I’m also excited for a new gen and a new story
RSUq4VfWfjE,"well im interested to watch this, No matter what they said"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thank you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,wack
RSUq4VfWfjE,Increíble trailer! Si se esfuerzan un poco más la película tendrá la misma calidad que Rápido y furioso 18

RSUq4VfWfjE,Yessss!

2:26 LANA

 0:03, 2:12 and 2:37 THE THREE GIRLS

AWESOME..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,this version has ghostbusters(2016) flavor. acting and story looks forced.   Charlie's Angels (2000) is way better than this.... more natural.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dollar store Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels: Modified. ☣☢☣
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's not a remake, guys
There are new angels in Drew-Cameron-Lucy universe"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Even if I do watch this,it’s 100% for Patrick Stewart only."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like an absolute flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cant believe how sexist this is
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disappointed

RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS FILM IS GOING TO BE A BOMB.👌🏻❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really prefer Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. This movie's not got even half the action as compared to the original Charlie's Angels. 😔😔😔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley is a woman, they protect another woman... Soo this will be like some type of feminist crap"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Arianators

RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is more excited for the song more than the actual movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,We need the funny angels back!
RSUq4VfWfjE,It wasn't necessary.

But you ended up watching it 
And liking it

so calm yourselves please, you’ll watch this and you’ll like it, if not satisfied w it, then start to comment all this shite.

(Btw Naomi Scott has been in two major remakes👀 girls getting successful every minute)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,“Looks like it was sponsored by Forever 21” - Grace (Beyond the Trailer) 😂😂😂😂 it does grace... it does
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just because they can doesnt mean theg should
RSUq4VfWfjE,The other Charlies Angel movies sucked I expect no less from this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who miss charles angle old?

RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t wait for this movie to bomb 💣 hard
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope you didn't spend a lot on this. It looks like its ONLY made for tween girls. I cant see any other demo going to pay for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really....smh....not gonna see it....smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Was it me but Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus & Lana Del Rey aren't that attractive in this Charlie's Angle move. The last 3 that played the angels was HOT.!"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:56 I`m not really interested in the rest of the trailer, I`m just rewatching because of the Ariana Grande soundtrack."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss Cameron Diaz 😥 She was the craziest Spy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Big load of 💩 incoming
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mandated diversity casting?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey look I’m gay!!

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood Fate: Dark Agenda 
Social Justice Warriors (read: Feminist agenda) a decade 10+ ago had taken hold and root in Hollywood that is why we are seeing movies churning out like these since..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Its 2019 and the Movie industry is STILL shunning BLACK women. They decided it ""safer"" to put a biracial uk black person with straight hair in place of an American black person with natural hair and call it ""diversity"" It would have been less offensive to just hire another white woman."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is the angel with the dude haircut?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Geez, why feminist ruin everything."
RSUq4VfWfjE,YES YES YES YES YESSSSS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Throw out Kristen Stewart and replace with Katherine Moennig and then I'd be interested.

RSUq4VfWfjE,crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can 2019 go five minutes without remaking a movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah but.... Charlies Angels nevered used guns.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeaaaaa, I’ll probably stream it on whichever platform it comes on, definitely not spending money though."
RSUq4VfWfjE,No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who’s excited for the single?

RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmm I think this will flop ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Shouldn't this be remade with fat old men? This is sexist please respect gender equality.
Re; ghostbusters the hustle oceans 8 etc."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The Charlie's angels that I know are:
White girl
Another white girl
And an Asian girl 

What happened?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m kinda salty, take one colour out and replace it with another colour. You can have more than one coloured woman in there you know? Sorry maybe I’m wrong but Lucy was just so badass in the last one. Still excited to watch this tho"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine why are you here? 😯😦
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is my lesbian duty to support this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's great that they are making more female spy movies. Totally Spies!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sucks like hell
RSUq4VfWfjE,That was *Totally Gay*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gonna show this to my mom.


She'll probably say something like ""The classics was better"" after watching the movie.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,IM LEGIT ONLY HERE FOR THE MUSIC AND KRISTEN
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will give props to Kristen Stewart for her effort in acting. It's like she plays the same character in every past movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gak ada yg seksi
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn Kristin Stewart killing it with the short hair
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Charles Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't they come up with original movie ideas?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing new...no new ideas. Plus the Hollywood has to kill male roles for the sake of equality that is clearly one sided in favor of females. This movie is going to tank.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only reason why I will watch this movie is because Elizabeth Banks is the director.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like the original  movie  version  Drew ,Diaz and Lui version. This movie I would say I will watch it thru Netflix or Red box but not in the movie house."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bring back Diaz, Liu and barrymore"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"99% will watch the movie because of Ariana Grande
50% will watch the movie because of Naomi Sccot
20% will watch the movie because the original movie sucks"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks like Ellen Degeneres mix with miley in wrecking ball.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley got turned into a woman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just gonna pretend like I didn’t see Noah Centineo at 2:05
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf Hollywood is trying hard to destroy every movie they make.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What does totally spies have to do with this trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Naomi look like twins 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"not for diabetics, too many eyecandies (:"

RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISSTEENNN STEWWAAARTTT👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😭🔥🔥🔥💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,can't wait for the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This trailer makes it seem like they are doing a ""serious"" twist on Charlie Angels; I only liked the last movie adaption because it went the comedic route and owned how ridiculous the premise was kinda like how the 90's version of The Brady Bunch worked because they owned how ridiculous that show's premise was. I bet if they re-made Brady Bunch today it would be a serious family drama."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought they were joking when they said they were making Charlie's Angel's but I guess the joke is the actual film itself. I don't know what looks worse, the movie itself or Kristen Stewart's haircut."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh noooo my fav film
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤦🏻‍♀️ this looks pathetic asf.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really hope they bring the original theme back. Or even an upgraded version, but that to me is Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am pretty sure Elizabeth banks will be the big bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Crap, crap, crap.... DOUBLE CRAP!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Some of it explodes, so he slaps it out of her hand and lets it hit the ground"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am not gonna watch anything that has kristen stewart on it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Make Kristin Stewart the new Catwoman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"drew, cameron, lucy and destiny’s child are unchangable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What a great idea, remaking shitty movies every 5 years."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanna watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Could be fine, but I hate using the name... just do a cool spy movie without the title tokken."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Might be watching this just for Jane alone 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,No esperava mais
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Elizabeth Banks unable to direct a movie and not be in it too?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Because obviously a petite woman can easily take on multiple muscular men... all in the name of feminism.
RSUq4VfWfjE,indonesia where is the difference....??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,i've never seen Kristen Stewart smile so much
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love this trailer I have it mimmorized in my head
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks so cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen ❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I remember that TV series there was in 2011, I think this will be better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Accept act apparently lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If Lucy, Cameron, and Drew even saw this I wonder what they’d 🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.""  Love it.  Someone has been reading Sherrilyn Kenyon.  :D"
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like S club 7 but without the boys and it's action instead of musical.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm wondering when are they going to cast a few dudes to be Charlie's Angels? Hey, all's fair in this crazy world..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"at 1:37 is it what ai think it is
?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like it sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks AMAZING, so excited to see this!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Naomi no no no the cast what a time to be alive
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hamburg ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be REALLY BAD
RSUq4VfWfjE,they put in a taco eater and a shitstain it's destroyed
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Please matron take them away."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For those who... ""Hate"" this and ""Hate"" themselves...get the F@ck Out of Here Now... Because you don't know anything about it ?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Que pasó con la inclusión Hollywood?, no entiendo porque no las volvieron hombres de color transexuales, pésimo servicio"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am watching this trealer just because of kristen she is so amazing and cool 😊❤❤
I love her😍😘🤗"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did you notice the memorabilia in the closet scene or is it my mistake?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is she the girl in aladin?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop for sure
RSUq4VfWfjE,Smashing! I’m up for this movie. A new secret agent joins vampire Bella Swan and Princess Jasmine on a quest to travel the globe and save the world
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wonder is Djimon Hounsou's character dies in this movie.


Surely not, they won't be THAT predictable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wonder is Djimon Hounsou's character dies in this movie.


Surely not, they won't be THAT predictable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wonder is Djimon Hounsou's character dies in this movie.


Surely not, they won't be THAT predictable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wonder is Djimon Hounsou's character dies in this movie.


Surely not, they won't be THAT predictable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Here because of *Ariana Grande* .✨

And I’m blessed.😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Have they released this movie? What's with those negative comments based only by watching a couple of mnts trailer, ppl?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looking forward to drooling over Kristen Stewart in November.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks packaged to cater for the younger viewers, not really for those who still loved the diaz, lucy liu and Barrymore version. But anyway.. Glad to see stewart in a different role."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie is great! But for sure, the critics will say negative things about this bec it is not MARVEL. Sad 😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The characters looks too young so it seems like a teenager spy movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"not bad, not bad at all"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"BeLlA bElLa WaKe Up BeLla 





( if u don't know what I'm on about u don't have a life )"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only one decent looking......smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood and TV have hit _Marxist Bottom_
RSUq4VfWfjE,Formulaic looking. Shocker.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella has left the chat
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Synchronized dancing, closets, and strong female leads... I just got cancer, thanx obama"
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Your movie studios were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this movie gonna make me respect women more?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHERE'S THE ASIAN ONE
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love how people are hating on the movie when they haven’t seen it yet. Also if you think it’s terrible I’ll like to see you try and make a creative, original movie/plot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,the best part about this movie will definitely be the song with lana del rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,🗑
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chava Iglesias people 😂😂😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,*No one can replace Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu!*
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the hell is wrong with people and making remakes and having different racial ethnicity is playing the roles
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m still gonna watch it but this definitely should have been Total Spies or She Spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"umm... it is a remake??
so... which one is natalie??
which one is alex??
and which one is dylan??
@_@"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was expecting a remake with an all male cast...c'mon...make it a comedy about 3 flamboyant gay men taking orders from a woman...
RSUq4VfWfjE,i'm so excited!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks and acts the same in everything....Elizabeth Banks is the only decent thing about the movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,i love the old one more.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Most of you all are so negative to something you have not even seen yet. Yes I too like 2000's Charlie's Angels but if you recall the generation before us hated it and thought it was pointless to remake the movie with such terrible cast. This was accompanied by a lot of racial undertones toward Lucy Lu. So let's not be them and give it a chance.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where is the diversity, one of the Angels should have been a man"
RSUq4VfWfjE,My heart was dancing when i listen ARIANA's voice.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am sooo excited for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cade a parte da Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg our beloved Bella is back!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks pretty bad anyone else?

 it has boring action scenes we've seen a lot of times, it looks boring and unfunny"
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many of the characters will be gay? Let's bet. I say at least 2
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:26 lana del rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,blow job wkwkkw
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie..........
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid storyline and bad actresses. I wouldn't not watch this if I was paid to.👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,This film is gonna have to be absolutely perfect to justify yet another remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worth it for fanboy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant waitt 😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Would like some actual Fit women who know who to Jump, Throw and Kick properly and not look like a someone who's barley thrown anything in their lives. Like that little throw in the trailer Krisin does. 1:39"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm glad to see bella and jasmine in the same team.
RSUq4VfWfjE,As long as the actresses are all virgins or monogamous I will watch it. But if i like someone and i find out they are not who they seem to be i usually go crazy and catch the criminals who slept with more then one person in their life.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old version
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawwwwwwn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie will not have sequel, that's a fact"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"the old charlies angels did not have any black actors, actresses at all. why now? diversity? putting pity on them?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice to see Kristen with hair for once. Terrible trailer and terrible music
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't waaaiiiittttt
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fox, Four, Five, generation Woke."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So it's just Totally Spies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just came here for Chris Pang😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should make an all male reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I would very much like Hollywood to do a biopic on Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesperson and now convicted felon,  roly-poly-boy-toy and daily punching bag for any number of his fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Englewood, Colorado. 

Perhaps it could be a musical.   One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning. 

Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared."" 

You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.  I ended up getting mauled by their German Shepherd who had been watching CNN a week or so earlier."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kstew is 🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Barbie Spy Squad: The Feminists Take Over
RSUq4VfWfjE,this talk too much conversation than action
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Imagine ARIANA, MILEY and LANA as THE ANGELS Abdbsbbdnsbdvbsjxhckvmfsvab"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now imagine lana del rey as a Angel ❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No shame, been listening to this trailer during my workout cuz the BG track is that badass (yes I’m a dude, no shame 😎)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It lacks kung fu....we want kung fu like the old version
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I literally the only person actually excited for this version?!?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This might be worse than Rambo pt 5
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angels more like Charlie's bitchs.
RSUq4VfWfjE,charlies angels-of death (killing their own careers)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for the full movie 🤗
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 is Naomi Scott's year
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need to see this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,36k thumbs down. Ouch
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never in my life being disappointed by movie trailer before.
RSUq4VfWfjE,✴️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why dont they make a Charlie's Angel's about men. This film is very sexist. There is no equality.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This feels like it would have been a solid Netflix movie..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Anjir, film nya seru kaya nya nih"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"are you serious this has to be a joke right, wow well you'll see why they say get woke go broke fuking idiots just had to go fucking with another classic"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ofmg! it is so beau...ugly.
.
.
.
.
.
you clicked, we know."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The twilight actress looks like an annoying lesbian
RSUq4VfWfjE,its not a remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want Ariana's songs
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wonder ""How do the entire team of this new Charlie's Angels movie feel like as they're reading the whole comments from people on this Sony Ent official youtube channel?"" It Obviously shows that nobody likes The Movie. If I were them, I could've probably fainted by a minute!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:51 reloads pistol..
Fires with burst rifle"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like dogshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks very ... mediocre.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Demi’s Darlings.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When is the song going out
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Honestly, I'm not even here for this movie..I'm only here for the new single by these three queens 😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,To the authors and upvoters of all of the Totally Spies comments: you really think that today's Hollywood would make a movie featuring young girls in tight bodysuits getting captured and put into all sorts of compromising situations? Just how naive are you?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gees can't you come up with new ideas.  The piss has truly been squeezed from this rock Sonyfony
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should've made it an all males charlie's angels cast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm just a normal single girl. I see Noah Centineo, count me in!!😊❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley was never a woman, STRIKE ONE. Last Charlie had an ASIAN (Lucy) and it was Horrible. Now because of this PC world, they must add an NEGRO as part of the Angel's on the screen STRIKE Two.  Will be like the all female Ghosthbuster Strike Three. Your OUT!!
One more thing, did you guys hear about the upcoming FEMALE BLACK JAMES BOND?  what is this world coming too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Should have never fired Amy Pascal ....this looks awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Given the current ridiculous trend in Hollyweird, shouldn't this movie be cast with three dudes?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I so can't wait to not watch this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think old Charlie is more funny than this. I miss them so much♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"MOVIE WILL SUCK AT THE BOX OFFICE!!!!!!!! 

Except for the names Charlie and Bosley this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the original Charlie's Angels.  The Angels were private investigators, NOT international spies.  Bosley was A MAN but because of a feminist libtard directing Bosley is now a woman just because. 

It has Stoneface Stewart in it who more than like does NOT do her own stunts or cartwheels.  It also has that libtard asshole Patrick Stewart in it as well. 

All and all a movie that will never see my money nor will I probably watch it online unless I am INCREDIBLY bored and need something to fall asleep to."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dear Major ""Studios""
We as consumers are forced to feed off the lazy & sad attempts of you staying relevant all in the name of ""a profitable business venture"". If you can't make an original idea a masterpiece & needs to revert to these remakes, then probably we should turn our attention to the Indie Studios... but that's probably & not realistically since money governs art/entertainment unlike the precursor times.


P.S... STOP REMAKING MOVIES!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Just because they can doesn't mean they should"". That's the moment where I zoinks scoobed out of here."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok but when are they gonna release the single cuz IT SLAPS
RSUq4VfWfjE,lana better be on more of the song!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tanbah cerita filem
RSUq4VfWfjE,patrick stewart <3 :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks freakin awesome questionable scenes tgo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didn't see no Cameron Diaz we know she's old
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love this reboot! And It doesn't matter whether you like it or not, it will be the best. It's just like a whole new experience and generation from the past."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol saw this in the theaters
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella left Edward and is now working undercover as an angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I couldn't even finish the trailer smh.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"She used to be MI6? She looks like in her 20's, when did she work for MI6, when she was 5?."
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah is everywhere these days
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not like...not sexy..boooo...dislike here
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is so f ing lame. so lame I felt the need to comment
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie will be weak af.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another recycled remake with sub-par looks and talent.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanna hear the songs
RSUq4VfWfjE,I look forward to pirating this film.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Some of these... Blows up""
*""Some of these explode""*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m really looking forward for this because Naomi Scott is here !!!!!!! Oh my holy shi* 😭😭😭😭😭😭 I love it soooooo much 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG!! NOSTALGIC
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks dreadful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,SOMEBODY RELEASE THIS SONG NOW
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:57 is the best part
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just WEAK.. sorry.. I'm a woman but this one is not that powerful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dont like to prejudge BUT no.Not without Lucy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Straight up fire....Women are killing the game rt now in all 🎥....Plus yea this is truly a bad azz generation for my 21  old....🔥🔥🔥🔥 Who has no idea who CHARLIE ANGELS originally was....😂😂😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol Uh No No And No I Already Know I'm Not Gonna Like It And I'm Gonna Stick To Loving The Original lol 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This would have been better as a Totally Spies live-action.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I predict 55% on Rotten tomatoes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did anyone notice the closet has clothes from the 2000s Charlie’s Angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yyyeeeeahhhh this is pretty much Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They should have just made a CGI version of the 2000 film. Like The Lion King. I think it would have been much better. Lol.

As for the music, the 2000 OSTs are definitely much better too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Um... does Hollywood need writers and original ideas, because I'm free."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Misandry?  Ms. Andry!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks completely bogus 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine and Bella reunites
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is so hot tho like damn
RSUq4VfWfjE,Leave the classic alone🤦🏾‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't stand naomi. Her everything is boring. Looks to charisma on screen. Pointless actress. She also ruined the Aladdin for me!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look I’m a straight female but damn Kristen Stewart is stunning
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women do stuffs I cannot do so I'm watching to learn 👍🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was here for the song because lana del rey was featured and she sang 2 words
RSUq4VfWfjE,Huh Charles Xavier did listen to mystique
RSUq4VfWfjE,seems like a movie that is STILL for the sexual satisfaction of males :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,What do you mean Charlie's Angels? This is Totally Spies Live Action. Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks absolutely ghastly!  Hey Hollywood, let sleeping dogs lie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love Kristen’s laugh!!:)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was excited when I heard a new Charlie's Angels movie was coming out, also featuring KStew. But this looks bad...And I'm all for adding more female characters as mains, but Bossley dude was pretty awesome and unique. This Bossley here looks generic and just a president lady with nothing special. The other two girls from the angels look generic too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanna watch Kristen Stewart on big screen again ♥️🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bring back Cameron drew and lucy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This isn’t even that bad,You guys are hating for no reason!😒
I loved it🎉🎉🎉"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i was gonna see this, but noah centineo is in this, so i'm deeefinately gonna see it now"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another big flop on the lines of the all female ghostbusters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie feels forced
And I don't like that"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girl power!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I do not believe women.
RSUq4VfWfjE,skill 👍👍👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else see a darker sarah michelle gellar?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Obviously the peppermints weren’t explosive because he wouldn’t smack it out her hand like that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,i like the old charlie angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only one that is hot is the tall black chick.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this movie is woke garbage like ghostbusters , pass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im done with “woke” feminism movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart doesn't look like a badass woman at all😫
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here for the song - Don’t call me angel until they release it ☺️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"they got the real charles this time, hahaha the mutant one"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thanks for showing us full movie on youtube :) .Now i should focus on my studies
RSUq4VfWfjE,this already looks so bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why the trailer isn't funny at all...
RSUq4VfWfjE,They swap a hot Oriental for a nygget. That's a losing formula
RSUq4VfWfjE,arent they suppose to be hot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mantap
RSUq4VfWfjE,"After full throttle, i never thought this would never come back"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stewart?   Already, I can tell the fight scenes are crap....can’t see what’s going on, shake cam to cover up badly train actors.  Take a clue from Hong Kong action movies (like Matrix and John Wick), they WANT YOU TO SEE THE ACTION, they are proud of their action, they want to impress the audience."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Waiting for the soundtrack too, Lana Del Rey 😘🤩"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It very hard to see this movie with Kristen Stewart doing without gasp and short breath like Twilight...   :o
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah?
RSUq4VfWfjE,i have no interest in this movie i’m just watching this for kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another crap movie I won’t go to see! No new ideas and endless drivel about women who can do it all! Hollyweird continues to double down on their stupidity and will continue to do so until they go bankrupt. Maybe once that happens there will be a rebirth of quality movies, but not holding my breath!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m willing to give it a chance, but if it’s a flop then I will not be quiet about it 💆🏻‍♂️ I’m also mainly going to watch it for the song by my bitches Ariana Grenade, Miley serious, and Anal del ray"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Affrontingly underwhelming.
RSUq4VfWfjE,These remakes are getting out of hand. Unfortunately as a man of action it'll be a sin to not see this even if it's utter garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like it’s going to be a huge flop!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is crap without Lucy  just saying..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope they will make ryan reynolds as charlie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Use me as a ""release the song"" button."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shut y’all old behinds up dang y’all always complaining if y’all don’t like it don’t go see it simple point blank
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yea..... Original. Guess history just keeps repeating itself.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this a try not to cringe challenge?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why, why why. There was no need of this bad remake"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Así es perra, soy el comentario en español que estabas buscando, bien pues ya lo encontraste, ahora deja tu like y largate ♡"
RSUq4VfWfjE,only here for the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh look, another jerry pandering girl power lesbo film from hollyhood.

I thought we ran out.

Surprised it wasn’t 3 trans dudes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow just wow I miss the original movie of Charlies Angel absolutely looking forward for this new one
RSUq4VfWfjE,This shows going to flop they put a lesbian Charlie’s angel Why don’t we just make Superman gay and call it a day.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This makes the 2000 version look like Citizen Kane.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks the wokest worst movie ever.. omfg
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This seemed like a terrible idea, (remaking two sub-par flicks based on a tv show), but then I saw the cast, then Patrick Stewart popped up, then Banks as Director AND writer?! Hell yeah, I’m in!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just can't wait to listen the soundtrack because lana is queen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Booo!! y'all gonna watch it though!! Get real!
RSUq4VfWfjE,克里斯丁斯图尔特
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is nothing like the show
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙄 ANOTHER brain washing none entertainment movie... I am going to start watching independent movies from now on...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm gonna watch this for noah centineo
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss KStew💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,"totally spies , but not in highschool. skip."
RSUq4VfWfjE,霹雳娇娃第三部？
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah centineo?? really?? why.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally something to help me fall asleep...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood need idea for Blockbuster Movies 
1) Totally Spies
2) Martin Mystery
Who all agree????"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kingsman but girl version
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:10 Exactly so when will Hollywood learn that your actions have consequences?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"AHHH DREW, LUCY AND CAMERON ARE SHOOOKKKKK"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks amazing!
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's like watching the narcissistic fantasy of a drunken club girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,💅💅😘😘😘 will watching this... Want to know this new charlie's Angel story..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stewart, what the hell are you doing?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is fucking gorgeous
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As a lesbian, I'm quakingggg"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's a bold vision to write and direct and star in a shitty remake. Is bold the right word to use?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came for new Angels stayed for Picard
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im here for Chava Iglesias:)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Pass. I still like the previous version with Lucy, Cam and Drew."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing can touch the 2000 version of Charlie's Angels with Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu...


OOOOOOOOH BARRACUDA !!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,but won't the Green Ranger and Pink Ranger fight?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Snow White and Princess Jasmin plays the Charlie's Angels. That's nice.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth bank job ide me
Facebook name im hack"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like I just saw the whole movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Can you stop touching? Because some of these blow up""
*smacks the peppermints off her hands*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,im just here for the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN IS PERFECT FOR THIS ROLE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Perfect casting
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so sceptical i can't blink
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, 👍🏼"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a real shitstorm
RSUq4VfWfjE,The old Charlie Angels are way better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ain’t that the girl who was in Twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Didn’t watch the first one, not watching this one either. 🚮"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks more like totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,This film looks dead
RSUq4VfWfjE,",??????????"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm sure this movie will be full of feminist garbage, a sure failure."
RSUq4VfWfjE,BELLA IS IN THIS MOVIE TWILIGHT FANS!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought they stopped making crappy Agent Banks movies in the early 2000’s.
RSUq4VfWfjE,We'll see I guess🤷‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,People are so bad at accapting new versions of movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ill only watch to see KS ...and EB.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If this does well maybe they could bring back drew, Lucy and get Cameron out of retirement to make an over the top Charlie’s angels with new and old teams maybe even bring back Jaclyn Smith that would be epic because this seems like a continuation look at the costumes in the closet"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart could elbow that dude 100 times like that.. he still be fine then he’d obliterate her
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't  wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a joke right.?
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's 2019. Shouldn't Charlie's Angel's be three guys who are all transgender?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels (2019) Main Cast: Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Ballinski, with Patrick Stewart, Djimon Hounsou, Sam Claflin, Noah Centineo, Jonathan Tucker and Elizabeth Banks in their supporting roles."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omggggg i can't wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart look so hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer must be fake. For resl. Kristen Stewart never smile. Mere fact I didn't know she knew how to do it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood heads; ""how we making more money now?"" ""Lets pretend to do a movie about women empowerment during me too movement but show skin and sexuality"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fart. Not into it. Il stick with Bill Murray thank you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A feminist version of Charlie's Angels? That's a contradiction in terms. Have they watched the TV series from the 70's? Have they even read the freakin' title? It is called ""CHARLIE's Angels"". It's a show about three female secret agents who act UNDER THE ORDERS OF A MAN NAMED CHARLIE, whose face we never see but who's always in a hot tub or a swimming pool in a mansion surrounded by beautiful women. Why this is not triggering SJWs? Oh no! It’s the patriarchy. Run!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't ruin movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The movie might be better than the trailer makes it look.  The music choice alienates possible male ticket buyers because it changes the tone from teen/adult action movie, to young teen/young adult female girl empowerment movie, which might have too many guns or action for that audience to want to see.  Your primary audience here is male, but the music targets the opposite.  


I have no problem with the Angels being strong women.  They've always been strong in every incarnation of the IP, and made villain male characters look dumb, so there wasn't a bad female image of the characters to react to, but it seems like the tone of the trailer seeks to make them even stronger, which is fine but not wholly necessary and again could be off-putting to male ticket buyers."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie where a 105 pound woman can simultaneously beat up three 225 pound male bodyguards. One will be a “Former member of Delta Force”. Kristin “Obviously Supposed to be a Dyke” Stewart will be a streetwise badass who doesn’t take anything from anybody...especially a man.  Also bet that the twist at the end is that Elizabeth Banks as Bosley is secretly in charge and not Charlie. He’s just the face of the organization while the women do all the work. This movie is going to suck harder than Jenna Jameson.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only two lines into the trailer and you already lost me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the asian chick
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where are the men among the Angels? I thought it was equal representation after watching ghost busters and men in black...
RSUq4VfWfjE,How is the song better then the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soooo they got Jasmine in the movie😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay Kristen Stewart can slay my life and I ain't complaining
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen can step on me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosely’s a chick now? Why not just call it Charlotte’s angels? 🤷🏻‍♀️ might as well
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was hoping to see some slow motion scenes like in the 2003 Version😐
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I never asked for this.
--The entire world"
RSUq4VfWfjE,when are we finally getting the fucking singleee
RSUq4VfWfjE,when are we finally getting the fucking singleee
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess jasmine ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm into it. Let's just see if it's as fun and charming as it looks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,damn so that’s what happen to bella swan after twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART IS SOOO PRETTY OMG HELP
RSUq4VfWfjE,😴😴😴😴😴😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y'all just couldn't make this totally spies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Half-way into this & I am turned OFF. Wow, ANOTHER REBOOT FLOP. (Hollywood has no imagination anymore)."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am surprised how boring CHARLIE'S ANGELS could look like
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart:((
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The trailer is lacking, in excitement interest and watchability."
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart could wreck me
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Professor X,is Charlie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this looks ridiculous, i'm gonna watch it and love it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley is a woman in this one? Hope they make it work.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well I guess every generation has to have their own ""Charlie's Angels"" movie...  it's really starting to get old..lolol   
Move along people nothing to see here...lolol    just some kids dressed up like Jaclyn Smith, Kate Jackson and Farrah Fatcett."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks lame. Not watching. Ugh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anything that pushes the believe all women narative can suck my balls.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shame
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hahahahahahahahahahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh two British and Kristen 😁 ok ✌️😜😝 different approach in the CA franchise 😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does one look like a LSB-IAN on meth and the other like a 3yr long serviced pot head? Thought the Angel's were supposed to be attractive?😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First sentence in the trailer "" I think women can do anything"". .....

Proceeds to close youtube"
RSUq4VfWfjE,GARBAGEEEEE
RSUq4VfWfjE,i think it looks interesting. with these remakes the try to adapt it for the time. i want to give it a chance.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where the song comes on omg kills meee pls guys tell meeee ufff The movie ist AMEIZING❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah... 'cause that's what we need... 

Another SJW remake instead of an original idea..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'd like to Charlie her Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks like absolute utter rubbish.
RSUq4VfWfjE,*sees noah cockroach* nvm this is going to be a bad one...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew Barrymore must be really sad after watching this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt it has more lore to than the original movies but the casting doesn’t feel right and the soundtrack is bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wierd kitchen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOOOVVEEE Kristen Stewart way better with this hairstyle
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Se avecina otro fracaso de taquilla,  la veré cuando la estén dando por televisión, pero si parece muy mala, perversa."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boy, now I can't wait for its Brazzers XXX parody ""Charlie's Sluts"" or something like that starring Mia Malkova, Vicki Chase and Adriana Chechik..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Most of the comments are like, ""Not here for this"", "" Remakes suck"", ""Totally Spies more and Charlie's Angels less"", and ""Sticking to the original with Lucy, Drew and Cameron"" kind of comments 😐😐
Y'all don't support a movie, don't waste time commenting on its trailer then"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who exactly asked for this shitty reboot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Subscribe
RSUq4VfWfjE,the blond one reminds me a bit of Tracer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This african american guy dc marvel charles angel!!!!!  I hate to see him.
RSUq4VfWfjE,not enough Elizabeth Banks in this Elizabeth Banks. disliked
RSUq4VfWfjE,So where's the 1976 Mustang Cobra II
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another feminazi film. Ugh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would watch this a lot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why there is two black chicks? what makes them so unique? I don't get it... where is the Asian and redhead? 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wahmins can do anything. Gender is a social construct. Can't the dumb feminists get their message strait?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ooh I hear ariana’s sweet sweet voice
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, let me get this straight. Deadpan McGee, Not-Jasmine, and someone I don’t know... are the new Angels? Can I ask why?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,cool movie .....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why i like read the Comment 🤦‍♀
RSUq4VfWfjE,"At 1:43, the way she says ""clothes"" is very pleasing to listen."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song is so impressive that it overtakes the movie trailer.... Excited to listen the single.... Great work.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF?
RSUq4VfWfjE,There are more Elizabeth Banks than my deposits in my bank.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh my!!  My favourite actresses are on the same movie!! 😘 Naomi Scott and Kristen Stewart!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love it!! Can’t wait to see it 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Interesting :'v
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t believe they didn’t gender swap Charlie. Probably gonna be a twist that he works for Charli
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why would you smack a potentially explosive out of someones hands so they drop it onto the floor? Like handle with care, no? Explosives 101??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont recall the old charlie angel have black angel. All are white angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Bank..damn you're so hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hmmm....  It will be interesting to see if they did justice to the old show like ""Last of The Mohicans"" did with grandaddy's old show.  I hope it is not a Ghostbusters or Discovery remake of the universe sort of disaster."
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,nobody asked for the clapped guy 14 year olds fantasize about. NOBODY. why would you taint a franchise with him 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"don't hate this movie. maybe this is just the new angels that charlie recruited like the continuation of the original movie. as you can see, they still have the original outfits of the originals in the closet scene. I'm really excited for this because I really miss Charlie's Angels and I hope they will interact with the original Angels here 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeessssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nope, still not beating Drew, Lucy and Cameron"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks. I can't handle short haired girls beating up man anymore.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow U 3 aren't drew Lucy Cameron !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never the same without Farrah
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw bella
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg 😧........... this looks terribly awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,How would German-Vietnamese gymnast Marcel Nguyen and his buddies react to this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"fk everyone's opinions, this movies gonna be sick"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They need to stop remaking movies and ruining them. Come up with new ideas Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,I pray this movie doesn't flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott looks like Abella danger
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm waiting for somebody to make a movie like this but with LITTLE girls.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart being the hottest ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,Since they love genderbending movies like Ghostbusters they should be men
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I will watch this just for Kristen ajhebxiwbslskkd
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Takes of wig"" thats right misogynist pigs im a feminist, if you couldn't tell from when i said women can do anything. I swear feminists have inferiority complex when it comes to men i mean we dont have to say how we are better and can do everything  with literally every piece of media we're in"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Might have to watch this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,what a shame call it something else cause charlies angels its not and music might be great but as far as i am concerned charlies angels needs a little of the original song.  like i said call it something else. its insulting to the original gals
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is still women being bossed by a man... 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,wtf is Professor doing there ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,there's too much Elizabeth Banks and The Angels don't get to shine that much
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why does this feel like ""TOTALLY SPIES""?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isn't it a bit like Kingsman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another Charlie's Angels film? I'll pass on this one!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Totally Spies"" will be perfect with college environment and new weapons 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood make a ""Totally Spies"" movie😉"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks why you didn't direct ""Totally Spies"" with this cast😑"
RSUq4VfWfjE,boycott this feminst trash.  these women need support animals and can't even drive irl
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love dat song in the bg
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love dat song in the bg
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is 2019 so obsessed with franchises from the 90s and 2000s?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thanks trailer helped me to save money
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope Crispin Glover makes an appearance in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,All lesbians and non-lesbians will react like the peppermints every time they see Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All these men complaining in the comments and here I am, a humble lesbian feeling blessed to gaze upon these girls"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Which one is ariana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now it's yellow man bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yep just as I thought. Nothing special
RSUq4VfWfjE,For those who didn't know Elizabeth Banks is in this movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"naomi scott is lovee
and is bella bored with her eternity with ed?
I CANT BELIEVE THERE'S GRANDE AND RAY IN ONE SONG AHHSDUISPS
and is that the guy from sierra burgess?
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HERE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,there is no fun vibes like dew and cameron always do i like the original sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,They wanna speak to a manager
RSUq4VfWfjE,This made me turn into an atheist
RSUq4VfWfjE,"is that the lady scrubs? there was white scribs. black scrubs, and female scrubs that looked at dude’s weiners 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this Disney channel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Effie trinket snappeddd
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its like Princess jasmine turn into a badass here 😱😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron , Lucy , and Drew are screaming at the tv"
RSUq4VfWfjE,what would you guys think if Whoopi Goldberg was cast as Bosley instead of Elizabeth Banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am satisfied to see kristen in this way...means awesome. ..but wait was that Noah?...means unexpected. .
RSUq4VfWfjE,The fact that ariana sang the song is a perfect thing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bella is a spy/ random badass and Edward is Batman. What's next? Also, where's Jacob?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"stewart, you look very beautiful with that long hair:(((("
RSUq4VfWfjE,I WILL GO TO THE CINEMA TO WATCH THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I LOVE KRISTEN STIWART ❤️🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Am i the only one that read that this is not a ""remake"" they didnt make this movie as a remake they made this movie as if it was getting released in this time like it has nothing to do with the first one if you get what im saying 😂 so dont be disappointed if its totally different from the original one, but i mean thats just what i read and i could be wrong 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Day one baby 😈
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewarttt I miss herrrr
RSUq4VfWfjE,More feminist propaganda. Sigh
RSUq4VfWfjE,It would be great experience watching Kristen Stewart & Naomi Scott in same frame!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jasmine, I was fairytaling and enjoying the carpet ride, suddenly woke up as C.A."
RSUq4VfWfjE,After seeing Kristin Stewart my little lesbian heart scram so hard
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait, Charlie still sounds like a white male???? That's fucking racist, it's 2019 come on!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Something missing in this movie that cannot match from the charlies movie of yr2000.
RSUq4VfWfjE,HELL YEAH MUTHAFUCKA
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:55  😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cookie cutter movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Banks Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want Kristen Stewart to choke me like that
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,If the people who sung the songs it might’ve been better
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yet another pointless remake....has no one in the film industry got any imagination any more?
RSUq4VfWfjE,uhm...wwhhhaatt ???? =/
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here for Naomi Scott!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg yasss!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this movie is a joke, original version is better"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok I get that people seem to really like the original (I haven’t watched it so I can’t really judge) but I don’t think it makes this new movie inherently bad. It seems like having a remake with new characters and different roles in a modern setting will make it interesting and not just a cheap knockoff. Besides, it looks absolutely badass. I’m excited for this movie!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are you kidding me?! Hollywood has no more creativity!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another group of ugly angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They keep remaking movies... those remake are super sucks... classic will always be classic
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:42 This is the best thing I’ve seen in weeks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm actually totally looking forward to this movie, but then again I liked Hustle and Oceans ...8? 😅"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They are not angels to me!  They look more like children!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noahhhh love you
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eeeww no!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna flop at the box office.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"FLOP
naomi scott and patrick stewart and djomun are the only positives from this shite"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Very cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,PLEASE RELEASE THE SONG
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer seems little feminist.
Ex- 
""You have a client""
Ans-"" who is she""
It could be a male."
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Beautiful movie if u seen this❤❤ hit like*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well cant stand the trailer. I can't imagine the stupid film. A waste of money.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just like the show, this is going be a campy guilty pleasure for me. It's no Oscar winner, bit come on, guys, it's *Charlie's fucking Angels.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie just screamed _'THIS IS A GAYS ONLY EVENT! GO HOME!'_ at me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine flew the magic carpet for this? Im crying...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi had a big come up it went from lemonade mouth to Aladdin then this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is not made for a wig
RSUq4VfWfjE,فيلم رائع متى سيتم عرضه
RSUq4VfWfjE,when song will be release ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It would have been 100x better if Ariana, Miley and Lana played those parts!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So exciteddddd
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love this Totally Spies live action movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Early 2000s Charlie’s Angels never used guns and I really liked that about them
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I feel like a Charlie's angels movie should be very cliche in order for it to work. It should be like mission impossible or James bond meets Austin powers.

It should be speedboats, cool but unrealistic gadgets and colour coordinated motorcycles lol. It should be over the top but grounded with comedy. Like a marvel movie almost. 

This doesn't feel like something you'd rush to the cinema to watch. Also missed opportunity to do a time piece and set it in a different decade. 70s or 90s would have been cool."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally a movie on the Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can this movie actually be a box office success!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never would have imagined Bella/Snow White and Jasmine/Kimberly(Pink Ranger) and Professor Xavier to be working together in the same movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That was...






Bad"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella just so cool in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damnn ..this trailer is so messy!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell yeah!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ma sister oww
RSUq4VfWfjE,Profesor X was tired if recruiting mutant so he went underground and hired spys ( Jasmine and bella)
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Kristen Stewart can act? XD lol oh wait that's right she could always act just got stupid written roles xD
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wanna meet the audio engineer and director of this shitty clip, the shitty music drowns out the dialogue."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Again? Ffs
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:07 why does Noah look so unflattering lately?
RSUq4VfWfjE,这是啥片，看不懂英语啊
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sucks!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"But Boslie is a dude , why would you change Boslie's gender ?
Justice for Boslie !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, at least is not blatantly showing a feminist agenda like Captain Marvel and doesn’t look as shitty as the new Feminator movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As a wise person once said ""Those who don't learn from their history are doomed to repeat it."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sex movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG Noah!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,MANNERS!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the lucy liu character? Noooo.... asian please....
RSUq4VfWfjE,คริสเท่น 💗😍❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,The next female Ghostbusters
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They can't replace the orignal girls of this movie ,they are to hot rather than being a warrior"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*WHY CAN'T THEY CAST MORBIDLY OBESE EMPOWERED DISABLED IMPRESSIONABLE YOUNG QUEER INDIVIDUALS,* instead of representing these skinny models to the world?!?!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't hear Lana's voice, isn't she in this song?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mmm that black chick with the English accent, the positions I'd have her all twisted in 😍 
I'll watch this for a mad perve.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mmm.. why them? Is there no artis hotter and energic than Them ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,They found the perfect way to promote feminism.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Girl power.

RSUq4VfWfjE,AND ARIANA GRANDES SONG?!? AHHHH THIS MOVIE 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO NO NO WTF IS THIS !!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why tf are there so many shitty remakes nowadays
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just change the title to totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,They broke the first rule and showed Charlie. Granted we all know it’s Patrick Stewart. But still
RSUq4VfWfjE,All right.  Captain Picard is in Charlies Angels.  Must be a time travel episode.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks pure shite
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. So much fashion. Welcome fashion Charlie's Angels. 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angel is just a _live action of _*_Totally Spies_*
RSUq4VfWfjE,We arent Arab.  İstanbul is not like that. We dont wear these clothes🤦‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh great another movie showing how cool and badass women are woooo...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful. Why is everything coming out of Hollywood lacking in authenticity.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i know this property came way before, but this is really giving me Totally Spies vibes right now"
RSUq4VfWfjE,That’s a no for me
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m so freaking excited for this movie!!!!!!!!!! Can’t wait to see Naomi Scott (a part South Asian as a Charlie’s Angel)!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love this Song it Needs that Trailer song ""Don't Call Me Angels, for Totally Spies!!! And also did any of you fans out there put that Video making trailer for totally spies version it could be fun.🙂❤💖🎵♥️💚💛"
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know....... Cameron Diaz......
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garrett Watson is crying
RSUq4VfWfjE,I‘m the one in the comments that doesn‘t care about the Movie but wants to know whats the name of this song at the end. With Ari and Miley
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uhhg! Why couldn’t you bring back Drew, Cameron, and Lucy?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hot garbage....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is amazing..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage. This movie already exists. Make new movies. Rehashing is a great way to lose customers.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ELIZABETH BANKS
ELIZABETH BANKS
ELIZABETH BANKS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked it better when there were two blondes and one asian.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well... at least Charlie is still a guy? But they’re bossed my Elizabeth Banks so maybe she’ll be the new “Charlie”?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's Mila Kunis ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks AMAZING! Naomi Scott is so cute!
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks stupid and gay. will not watch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Silly, and Kristen Stewart still couldn’t act. Garbage movie I see a flop coming"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks dope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,nobody notices the papa midnight?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No thanks I perfer Camren Diaz,Drew Barrymore and Lucy lou."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen has ruined EVERYTHING
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No, No and No!!! Ill be glad when the day comes when this feminist movement is over and people come up with new ideas for movies instead of remaking old ones but with a feminist twist. BOSELY was a guy, not a pink panty girl!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels without Drew Barrymore... Disgusting...!!!🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a B-movie. A one and done kind of thing. It's not really a must watch. It looks nice but I'm not sure I'll go see it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish one is Asian
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All the people in the comments have a point, this looks like it could be an okay Charlie's Angels film but would've been an amazing totally spies live action"
RSUq4VfWfjE,As s female please stop with these all female cast movies....they are horrible... you picked three “women” that legit look like 15 year old boys.... 🤦‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,not the same without lucy liu 👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,this such like girl version kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too many porn act...boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,"until proven, nothing will ever beat the original charlie's angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen u flirting🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is so fucking beautiful thoughh😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll go watch this movie just to see Naomi Scott again...Yes just to see HER....!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,cant wait for the charles angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,I MISS KRISTEN STEWART ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't call me angle 😝
RSUq4VfWfjE,Way to kill that
RSUq4VfWfjE,"NOOO
Kate Beckinsale 👩 Milla Javovich 👩 Charlize Theron"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You guys know what the definition of an angel is right? Wait... weird.. just looked it up..
An-gel /‘ānjel/ noun. Mouth breathing twilight girl."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love this movie i like ella balinska😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will only watch it if there are no feminism bullshit in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,What I appreciate about it is that it looks like early 2000s. So it might have that going for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh cool, they made Eric the midget’s movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garrett will be so happy
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY?????????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All comments negative 
Yet 122k likes to 33k dislikes
🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They only made this because of the PC outcry, ""hey why hasn't there been a black or wack angel 👼 thats just not right! Soon we will be needin a Hindu 👼, and then an Indonesian and so on and so on....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't know why but I felt that this 2:53 was longer than 2:53.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like Somy didn't learn its lesson with wokeBuster's 2016.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Release the music “NOW”!!!!! I need it in my life!!  😫😩😫😩
RSUq4VfWfjE,When you can tell that a film is going to be absolute garbage just from the trailer....that's how box office bombs happen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:45 I see those 2 outfits from the original y'all tried to sneak tht in
RSUq4VfWfjE,K stew is hot. Damn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"whos here just recognize naomi scott, cause she playin in aladdin movie:v


just kidding bruh:v😂😂🙏🙏"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Goddamn it Patrick. You are from a theater background. You went from Logan to this disgraceful utter Scheisse.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait this film and can't wait this song..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell ya we got Jonathan Tucker
RSUq4VfWfjE,One word PASSE.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So which one is the transgender? That's the thing these days, isn't it?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lana del Rey, Lana del Rey and Lana del Rey are my Charlie's angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier's Angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,am I the only that thinks Naomi Scott looks like a younger darker Sarah Michelle Gellar? They should totally do a Buffy reboot with her as buffy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That's so cool to hear Elizabeth Banks is writing and directing, now. 
Such a talented and charismatic actor. I'm really looking forward to see what she can do when she's at the wheel in a larger capacity. Fingers crossed."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No, you got to be kidding me 🤯"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sabrina  Elena  Jane
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whoever casted Kristen Stewart should die in a fire
RSUq4VfWfjE,i already know the song is gonna be 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Literally everything is being remade these days xD
RSUq4VfWfjE,Les films sont excellents.ça permet d'enlever les soucis.
RSUq4VfWfjE,....sigh more feminist fecal chunks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really dont feel this movie, I used to watch Charlie's Angel with the vibe of comedy although in trailer. They used to  have a lot of different clothes and we dont know that they have that kind of stuff. I used to named those Angels Dylan, Alex and Nat. And I used to watch those girls with the atmosphere of something that I can't explain right now when they have a task and they have to disguise of something different from their original personality. Also they are funny while doing the mission. And now from this trailer, just trailer. I really dont feel it. I really dont think they've named not Dylan, Alex and Nat. They already show us that they have a lot of cabinet's with a lot of different clothes like how ""Totallies Spices"" work. They not funny like how 2000's Charlie's angel. Even the movie its not like comedy. Its strange. Like I prefer to watch again the two 2000's Charlies Angel than spending money for ticket that I I dont really feel the vibe of this kind of charlie's Angel. Just saying, no hard feeling"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"naomi scott:
disney princess to an angel.
 wow"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only care about Lanas part in the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else thinks Charlie should be played by Oprah and not the old guy anymore.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"spotted the most cliche things in this trailer
Breaking the laws of physics.
sexual dancing in the club ( that in ever FUCKING MOVIE) 

in a battle where you know characters post to die ( BUT ITS THE FUCKING MOVIE AND CHARACTERS THEY CHEAT REALITY )
only non-white character ( mostly black female characters are put into a love interested with a non-black male character ) ( when i see this in every movie it get annoying ) and im white.
know actor is playing in a shitty movie just so they can get a quick cash grab .
a device that can be use as a weapon to destroy the world ( its in every fucking movie people ) .
trying to make a Joke into a weapon room ( its in every spy or action movie)
making Cops useless( EVERY FUCKING MOVIE A COP IS USELESS ) 

driving cars that we normal people cant afford ( wtf how are you a spy diving a 100k car and trying to blend in.. 



ill pass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringing...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Lucy Liu's counterpart here???????????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella's stunts got me shookt😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like Totally Spies, not Charlie's Angels. Can't complain though, Kirsten Stewart looks like a bombshell ready to be detonated."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I know this movie is supposed to be about female empowerment finger quote it's just another feminist empowered movie but wouldn't taking orders from a man contradict the whole female empowerment
RSUq4VfWfjE,The intro was great
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm only here for ""Kristen Stewart""❣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:45 outfits from the early 2000 films with Drew, Cameron, and Lucy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie is going to bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What I love about the Charlie’s Angel trailer is that the guy who says something completely sensible (*Women can do anything they want*, “That doesn’t mean they should”) gets strangled for it in the next few seconds."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. Trs kabar angels yg dulu gimana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,You ruined it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Because they could do the movie, it does not mean they should. The movie that nobody asked for it lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who else noticed that Audi is letting it us see all the new cars that they are releasing in 2020, specially the R8 and the A1"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here only for Kristen😄
RSUq4VfWfjE,I bet at least one is gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,I bet at least one is gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing like forced diversity to add to your cinema experience
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ah man remember how hot Demi, Lucy and Cameron looked, and now we got this???!?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi is so beautiful i can't
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noooo not the thumb guy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If it was ""Totally Spies"" then it's a sure hit😍😘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ari's voice is🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Liberal morons
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:29 el profesor x de los x-men
RSUq4VfWfjE,How look! Another movie nobody will bother to go see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"me: Might be worth to watch
2:39 cast includes Miley Cyrus
me: Nevermind"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just you wait and see. This will be a regular, fun, spy/action movie. Meanwhile Effing TERMINATOR dark fate will be be progressive, feminist, man hating ball of she-ot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT TURNS ME GAY
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really enjoyed the trailer! Looking forward to seeing this in November 😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks to be mediocre at best!
RSUq4VfWfjE,UMMM No...  This is not Charlie's Angels material. It does not stack up. Looks like a bad straight to Netflix movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristin stewart: I believe girls can do anything.
Handsome Asian guy: yes they can  in Pornhub!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm all for girl power...........but only in porn! Hahhahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,CRINGE. 😷😷😷🙊🙊🙊👎🏻😿
RSUq4VfWfjE,IT STINKS
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie is like barbie in a spy squad academy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why aren't they hot? Even Kate Jackson was hot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks just sad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missing Drew Cameron and Lucy 😔😞😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Try to do the slow mo in 0:25, her head didnt hit the guy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo will just make this better
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who miss the charlie's angel OG soundtrack?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott: from princess to agent
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart looks like a gay dream and i will watch this movie for her alone if nothing else
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A movíe that starts with ""women can do anything"" and later shows you whats MOST important to women: cute dresses and looking super hot. (also I love how 50kg girls beat up trained bodyguards)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WOMEN DONT SPEND MONEY ON ACTION MOVIE, WTF CHARLIE'S ANGELS WAS WATCH BY MORE MEN THAN WOMEN IN THE 70's, AND THE ANGEL'S WEREN'T OVERPOWERED MARRY SUES, YOU CAN TELL THERE TRYING TO HARD."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s Angels is not about an action movie; it’s all about ironies and mockeries. This should not be another batwomen movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I prefer my generation's charlies angels drew, cameron and lucy. 😊"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like this Kristen Stewart !1!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Kristen I love ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cool, can't wait November please come quickly.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yet another legendary franchise going to hell because Hollywood can’t do anything original. This will, again, water down what was once one of the most female empowering shows of the 70s. 

Side note: who was clamoring for yet another Charlie’s angels reboot? And why is Bosley now played by Elizabeth Banks? Weird."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Miley Cyrus?
Das it - I'm out!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is worse than Batwoman.
Their likes are purchased."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Diaz  and Drew ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought this was a TV show
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks more like a live action for Totally Spies. You can't just casually replace the iconic Cameron Diaz, Drew Berrymore, and Lucy Lui trio. And with whatever this is..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Come on guys, give it a little credit. The movie hasn’t even come out yet"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see Kristen Stewart still can’t get through a scene without blinking like she just walked through a sandstorm.  They have drops for that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen 🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noahhhhh 😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh hell naw
RSUq4VfWfjE,ITS LIKE GHOST BUSTERS ALL OVER AGAIN
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella and Jasmine are sailing on the same ship.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, this might be one of the worst trailers I've seen. It's quite an achievement I must say."
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of them looks like a bull dyke.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now Hollywood will ruin Charlie's Angels, what's next?. Back to the future, Terminator, alien?. What happened to the original Hollywood ideas."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They could at least make an Asian,White,Black and Latin girls. Something new"
RSUq4VfWfjE,it kinda looks like a ghostbusters remake type movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cool, can't wait November please come quickly.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,A big NOPE.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks really stupid. Just like the other ones back in the early 2000's!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow Kristen looks amazing in this, her hair everything about her she really stands out."
RSUq4VfWfjE,WAHGELASEHHHH ANJIRRR
RSUq4VfWfjE,being played by men? This is the age of diversity where gender equality exists and roles of classic remakes get gender reversal treatment with view to... Ohhhhhhh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want over posing and over reality movement.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ㅇᆞ
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Anyone else noticed those iconic costumes worn by Lucy, Drew & Cameron?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks so flat and seems like it’s aimed towards young teens. The other movies were funnier and more mature.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was hoping for an asian angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yet another cash grab remake inferior to the original material.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*This movie was shorter than I anticipated*
Oh it's a trailer... Ok"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Check out the Charlie's angel trailer right now*
What...why?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Ariana? I don't see her. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😫😫😫😫😫
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ew wtf that’s not Charlie’s Angels xD
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mostly excited about the destiny's child reunion soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i honestly feel like some things just need to be left where they at: with the original 3, but i really wanna see this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've got a bad feeling about this...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Your first mistake was thinking of putting Kristen Stewart in the film.  Your second mistake was putting Kristen Stewart in the film.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Better than Batwoman but still not that great honestly
RSUq4VfWfjE,did jasmine break up with aladdin and became a spy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wasn't expecting to like this. Now I need to see it. Looks great!
RSUq4VfWfjE,nnnnnnope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watching this masterful, capably edited trailer for what will be the best movie of the year... Is like a party in my mouth, and everybody’s throwing up.

Also, why aren’t the angels being played by men? This is the age of diversity where gender equality exists and roles of classic remakes get gender reversal treatment with view to...

Ohhhhhhh."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've watched a couple of trailers recently and I've noticed that a couple of actors are becoming quite sought after recently
RSUq4VfWfjE,Better than mission impossible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Show made popular through its TNA now contains none in the trailer.

Hard pass."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think it’s going to be amazing 💘 I’m gonna actually watch it before bashing it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"CHARLIE'S ANGELS - THE ""B"" CUP ANGELS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So where's Arianna Grande?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"uptill i see Kristen Stewart in it i thought not bad ,Then i see her & i will pass.................."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here just for Kristen Stewart! 😍🖤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y aren’t they in the kitchen!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope. I'll pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Taking advantage of the women's rights stuff. Just great.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They had the nerve to make Kristen Stewart an Angel. I'm done 🤦🏽‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ooooooof.  The vampire girl should stick to brooding teen movies and Elizabeth banks is way better than this remake type of crap.  I too cannot wait to avoid this in any way possible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is sad 😭😢😵😷
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yet another Angel after Angel Grove for Pink Ranger and Rita..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So this is a SJW, feminized movie ? Okay, pass .."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody asked for this movie. In fact why isn’t there an all male version? This is sexist.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female bosley? That's stupid.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is what Bella did when Edward left her 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, is this one of those ""Released straight to Morrisons/Walmart bargain basket"" films"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:07 As much as we all didn't take too kindly to Kristen Stewart because of the Twilight films, according to this bit, she`s the same, though."
RSUq4VfWfjE,TRASH
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks really really bad. Makes the Diaz/Lui/Barrymore version look positively intellectual by comparison. Has the potential to turn into an awesome drinking game movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Will probably still be crap, but at least the agent(s) are not afraid to use guns."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thanos Sperm in your face. Feminism
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a very poorly cut trailer but the movie does looks fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t really care for this movie lmao I just wanna hear the song 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Some movies just DON'T need to be remade.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer wise it doesn't have the charlie's angels feels. It just has the charlie's angels description. Film wise i bet it would be the same. Sadly will be a waste of money, time and etc."
RSUq4VfWfjE,you bitches just have such small brains and little eyes to rate a remake based on its past and also the cast too
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why I think this is going to suck big times
RSUq4VfWfjE,i am feeling Max Steel's gonna have a rival in rotten tomatoes real soon...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will need to see this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why people just basically call this as a flop, lots of people look on the IMDB and rate this movie, ehem even Twilight also got 5 stars out of 10, i mean wtf??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,original squad was the best
RSUq4VfWfjE,Glad to see Prof.X scouting new talents.
RSUq4VfWfjE,How can so many grown men hate women its unfathomable.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I kinda wanna watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope the actual movie doesn’t have as many quick shots
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie can either be bad or at least ok. Also, are we just gonna ignore the fact that the mystery of working to some guy who gives you tech and info isn't a thing anymore because they have an ""it's a government thing"" explaination?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh Garret Watts is gonna love this,unless he already saw the trailer and is already fangirling for an eon about it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:04 oh Kristen ! that whistle is loveeeeee<3 <3!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why do they remind of Samantha, Chloe and Alex from totally  spies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,My dog can act better than Kristen strewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"so not Charlies Angels caliber, more like some random spy movie. Looks like another make work project for someone. Does no one out there have imagination instead of remaking the remakes???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So no Chinese 'angel' anymore?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Traaaaash!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where is the ""I didn't ask for this"" button?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAH CENTINEO IS THE ONLY REASON IMMA WATCH THIS MOVIE
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Maybe the first trailer ever that I did not manage to watch until the end. No thanks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart? Movie ruined. -_-
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone thinks Naomi Scott looks slot like Sarah Michelle Gellar?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This remake, still doesn’t have the feel of a Charlie’s Angels.  I feel like that this remake is still lacking something that makes it a true Charlie’s Angels.  Of course no matter how they remake it, it’s always going to be compared to the 70’s tv show."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not another bad remake...
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is a gays event only go home
RSUq4VfWfjE,Literally the first line told me this is gonna be some feminist Bs reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,xin tên bài hát
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I wanna watch it and I'm not sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,i cant wait for the reviews🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another remake?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks so bad. Why do we keep remaking stuff? People in Holywood are out of new ideas? Sucks so bad,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this a reboot or sequel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The pink ranger and rita are teaming up? 🤔🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,My childhood
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:51 Am I the only one who finds Jane just a little bit attractive???🤔🥴🖤❤️ps:I’m 13 ~thirteen...
RSUq4VfWfjE,When is the single coming out? 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh find me
Ghostbusters all ovet again"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I missed Kristen Stewart in women look, please bring her back"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You guys know they're not taping over the old Charlie's Angels right? You can still watch it, it will still be there on your video shelf when you get home I promise."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lacks any style.    i would rather watch 2 episodes of  MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THE TV SERIES WITH MARTIN LANDAU then this rubbish.
RSUq4VfWfjE,",🤪"
RSUq4VfWfjE,WOOOOOWWWWW 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why are there some people who are uneasy with the part where the song says ""Don't call me angel""? like of course the girls are called Charlie's Angels, but i think what the song is trying interpret is that...even tho they are called Angels, they dont act like one. They hurt and kill bad people. So it's like, ""I'm an Angel, but don't call me one, cuz i aint one"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look how bella swan  fights 😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,"But but, they dont use guns..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,all people can do is make remakes now? and make it absolutely crappy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yall are like this is gonna be bad but at least give it a try and the song is nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,When pink ranger is a traitor ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Never watched Charlie’s Angels, and only found this movie cause of Naomi Scott. But I just watched the OG trailer and now this one, and I, even though a big HUGE Ari and Naomi Fan, this just ain’t it. Probably will watch it lol, but only cause Ari and Naomi are in it lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks awesome!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is becoming old now
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now we're in rebooted reboot material that's getting another reboot, damn you Hollywood"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🎶don’t call me angel🎶
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it true Kristen Stewart had 8months of intensive training to learn how to smile?
Then they had to CGI her smile on in post production anyway"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is not 'fUNNy' ookkkaaaayyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only complain I have is the existence of Noah Centineo... He is literally everywhere and I am a little sick of it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is a legit queer dream come true and I love it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,lady looks like Sarah Michelle Gellar
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I mean this still could be better than the 2011 television series that was canceled
RSUq4VfWfjE,trash million dollar
RSUq4VfWfjE,where is cardi b
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They should have used men instead as the angels. I mean after all they use women on ghostbusters. I think it'd would be fair to use men on this one, you know equity and all that."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This gets a bad rep already but I kinda love it 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,at least kristen stewart's lack of emotion will suit her character
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only girl I like out of this movie is Elizabeth Banks but wish they didn’t come out with this movie. Flop 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,None can replace cameron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Move aside Ghostbusters 2016, you maybe dethroned as the worst movie ever made. 🤣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Add Keanu as Charlie......hell of a combo
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hate to say it, but this movie looks like it's going to be a hell of a lot better than the other two."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well they use ariana grande,  miley cyrus and lana del ray name hahahha"
RSUq4VfWfjE,When this song being released? 🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uh, wasn’t Bosley a guy? Why did they decide to let Elizabeth Banks have the role?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,More She Spies than Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there no Asian Lady!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Less fun, moer SJW. Great job..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Old Charlie's are better i think based on this teaser, they seems weak"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Meh
Fighting, shooting, techies women 😴 yawn. 
Look like flatline character arcs and something you’d see on streaming service as an original movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m so happy for Naomi
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks completely devoid of any style or creativity. There was a cool way to do the opening scene. Maybe the Asian guy  was an old man speaking in Chinese while his sexy translator repeats his sexist rhetoric and then Stewart's character surprises him by speaking in Chinese herself and then does all the fighting stuff but better with more imagination. Instead they're just blowing through the script with a paycheck mentality like we can't tell the difference between art  and a product.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gonna be a killer comedy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t know what happened in the trailer. Kristen’s beauty blinds me 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Baby girls do these movies really need re make that’s so boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't call me Angel
Yes you are correct because you are fit for ""Totally Spies""
Kristen Stewart is Clover
Naomi Scott is Sam
Ella Balinska is Alex
Who all Agree😉"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I prefer Atomic Blonde. Grittier.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If they had taken ""Totally Spies"" with the same cast it might be a Blockbuster 😎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh sony. Looks like you wasted 100mil on some garbage. 😔😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart is the wlw icon we deserve
RSUq4VfWfjE,My wig has also been snatched
RSUq4VfWfjE,When is the release date?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist movie huh? Do the broads get naked at least?🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMG laughing so hard at this feminist trainwreck😂 🤣 More millions down the woke hole. Put this one next to the Ghostbusters flop, Oceans-whatever female one, etc. Trash."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like it could be entertaining.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not bad. Too early to tell whether this can survive as a franchise. Looks like a fun film, though I think the Barrymore version had a better trailer."
RSUq4VfWfjE,does every movie have to an identity politics trash? all these women beating up men it makes believe domestic violence is not big deal because its a fare fight ok guys start beating up women lmao don't do it life is not a movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this even necessary?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sooooo not gonna watch it. Why does justin bieber is in this movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh.

Oh *no.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf three months til November like?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A lot of times if the movie trailer is bad, I would wait to see it on blueray instead of going to theaters. After watching this, I will not even want to watch a pirated version for free."
RSUq4VfWfjE,There should be an asian angel!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine just changed
RSUq4VfWfjE,adult totally spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man, they’re really feeding the lesbians here huh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A movie called Charlie’s Angels with a title song that states: “Don’t call me Angel.” Eye roll. This is as lame as it gets, SJWs."
RSUq4VfWfjE,the best parts of youtube video's are the comments
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a piece of trash this movie is gonna be.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Want to see Chris’s to make it watch the movie. Lizzie Borden
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i just came here for the audi
i want de audi 0:57"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm I dont know
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Buzzly should have been one hell of crazy funny dude not a female!!🤦🏿‍♂️

Bt ey cant wait😁😁😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:32 that scene tho🤤🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:10- I think WHAMEN can do NOTHING, other than WHINE."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can’t hear Lana or Miley, all I hear is Ari☹️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wonder what Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz. Honestly feel about this. OG 2000 change my mind!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they keep regurgitating the same bullshit over and over again? 😁😁😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,*DISAPPOINTMENT*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Very worst worst movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Producers: ""How much social justice shall we cram into this movie?"" 
Elizabeth Banks: ""YES!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m waiting for a remake of Escape from LA...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is soooo hotttt
RSUq4VfWfjE,awful. first is just 2 angels + the client that can hold its own on a battlefield? then why ask for charlie? second it seems charlie is sir patrick? jeeez. and havinga female bosley is vomit inducing. i prefer the charlie's angels from 2000 at least they where fun action films. this seems to have the vibe of oceans 8....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watching this after having just watched the trailer for the one released in 2000
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just want the song..give me the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,*So I have to wait until November to hear the song ?* 😨
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not enough men
RSUq4VfWfjE,น่าเลียมากคับจะเลียยันรูหนอแตดเลยคับ
RSUq4VfWfjE,So why did Kristen Stewart steal Ruby Rose's look for this movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kstew is so pretty i can't wait 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked the new *totally spies* movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's so bland!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My favorite part of the trailer was when everything looked terrible and I decided I was never going to watch it, not even ironically."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wish Cameron, Lucy and Drew kick this Twilight bi*ch's drug addict face."
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is Ellen DeGeneres doing ? Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hope it flops.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want Cameron, Lucy, Drew back despite being old now. Can't stand this Twilight b*tch."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Destroyed respect that I had for this series.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:25 Kristen with brown hair looked really pretty
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First Twilight, now Charlie's angels. I want to punch this c*nt."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Have to bare only for 1 week. Frozen 2 will be released next week.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought the person in the thumbnail was pink
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony the company with no ideas some can only release reboots. Who on earth wanted a new Charlie's angels or a sequel to a already ruined jumanji. There is no need to ruin anymore. Please stop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Overrated twilight c*nt again.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would love to see iconic old old cast again instead these random boring girls.
RSUq4VfWfjE,4 letters... F.L.O.P.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No lucy liu? Not worth it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Absolute doo doo
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody: 
Hollyweird: here you go a new “Charlie’s Angels” movie that no one asked for"
RSUq4VfWfjE,so interesting that I fell asleep 30 sec after trailer start
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony just keeps going with clunker after clunker. Its like they are trying to tank there own company.


This might be some film fluff to watch when it finally hits the likes of Netflix. But cinema trip worthy it is not.


Sony, what the f*&k are you doing?!?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Poor Patrick Stewart.... how much money did they offer you to sh1t all over your acting legacy?.... Why Patrick? Why??
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO THANK YOU!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart I'll totally be gay for you 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imagine unironically liking this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That looks pretty much like the dumbest remake ever!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Welcome to the Drop Flop Movie Group.
We had most worst X-Men, most worst Hellboy, most worst Anabelle and now, we will have another worse Charlie's Angels next. Welcome !!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uh my comment has been deleted

Corruption and no free speech allowed yet again

Actually there's alot of comments been deleted I even took screenshots of people's comments to prove it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Failure to comply with our terrible ideas will have you terminated, Sign SonyEntertainment."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The fact that they included the dresses and suits from the 2000's movie is so amazing! I hope there's a name drop of Alex, Dylan and Nat"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bella > Charlie's Angel
Edward > Batman

bruh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally Kristen stewart get long hair
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fans : i want robert and kristen comeback

Now 
Edward : rightnow i am back, and become  A batman and you? 

Kristen : i am Charlies angel 

I love them"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They look like Totally Spies
Kristen Stewart is Clover
Naomi Scott is Sam
Ella Balinska is Alex
Who all Agree😉"
RSUq4VfWfjE,it's gonna be fun watching this mess flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen's so hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks and smells like woke feminist garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,My fav actresses in one movies wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,TRASH.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok take a breath on this concept... if they decide to reboot the bionic woman I think Kristen Stewart should play Jamie's part. What do you all think?
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's you all problems this trailer is fucking awesome specially kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant wait for this movie. I think its gonna be great 😍😍😍😍😍😍 i really exited
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm out
RSUq4VfWfjE,Witness the birth of a new cinematographic genre: FEMINAZI
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so gonna watch this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,snoozed after 30 secs.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like it may become one of the worst movies of all time.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Humm, no,  I don't like this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, this is one of the dumbest movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wonder if Sony is going to pay for seats aswell.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mampir gess ke channel ane ,, ada Vidio real no hoax , penampakan hantu pocong paling jelas no editing video,, masih hangat 02-07-2019 . Jgn luppa like dan subscribe karna subscribe itu gratis 😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's a shame to see that Hermione has taken the wrong path.🙏😢
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know whether to like or not 
I need help"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible cast/director for this reboot. Js
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait there’s this one girl that looks like the Jasmine actor from Aladdin
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did i just saw noah centino there being called 'the handsome nerd' well u r right
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did we just watched the whole movie in 2 min😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,LGBTQ version? Th charlies angels are Lesbian atleast one of them clearly is. The villain looks like gay their weapons guy sure is. I am just wondering where is there no black angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi!!!!! 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,So where is the Asian girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, let me get this straight; you keep volatile explosives right inside a house in a closet that doesn't seem to have a hint fire resistance or fire suppression, nor any explosion proof thick walls, and these explosives are so volatile the woman shouldn't even touch them, after which you ram your hand down upon said explosive, making it fall straight down to the floor to land with a sudden shock... wow this writing is stupid.


Let's see if I can guess the entire movie, shall we; every man is a bad guy, with the exception of the guys they have the hots for, who are all bunch of simpering wimps (until of course the sequel if one ever would be made); and all the bad guy's are misogynistic pigs who think women all women should be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen without getting a say in the matter. The women can do no wrong, and the only reason why the strong competent wahmen isn't believe is because of vagina.


Lot's of male crotches will be punched, hit, and harmed, while they all get proven to them just how wrong misogyny is, but they say woman-haters anyway (which makes these men not evil bad guys making bad choices but men with chemical imbalances they have no control over, we'll just lough that off though, and we'll trust you're too stupid to notice the contradiction), and we'll show off just how women can do ANYTING...


Except defeat highschool boys at their chosen professional sport, apparently."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart, still as punchable as always."
RSUq4VfWfjE,why does this feel like it should've been released in the early 2000s?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wheres the asian girl?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like they're singing the Kim Possible theme song @2:15.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Did I just heard, SUGAR RUSH's ""TASTY"" here??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey look Bossly got a sex change!
RSUq4VfWfjE,DUMPSTER FIRE TRASH!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really wonder how much u pay google to give u like's here!?!?!? please send me the bill so I can push some garbage movie. Really bad movie, i hope it makes top 10 million so they stop with this garbage !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,the song sounds like a Bratz
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Most useless bodyguards ever.
bodyguard 1: hey our boss is gonna die, should we shoot her?
bodyguard 2: Nah let's just aim our guns at her, by the way who is guarding the door?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie's gonna suck...Kristen Steward can't be funny whatsoever.... it's like when they try to make Wednesday Adams smile.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chodoo movie re-again....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously. This trailer has no focus, no momentum. It’s random shots, stop-and-go music, and cluttered. And how many times does Elizabeth Banks’ name have to be shown? They credit her as director (twice), actress and screenwriter. This movie is not gonna break even and this trailer is making sure of it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked Kristen and but other two girls are awful!
RSUq4VfWfjE,So I guess a considerable part of the budget was spent on teaching Kirsten how to bring an actual credible smile.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No. Just no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,damn some of you are so salty
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf happened to the angels? lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No Aladdin soundtrack? I'm disappointed, man."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like the old one better. I might be able to forgive this new version if there's a boot-knife kill, or maybe another hair collecting umbrella sword dude."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok... I think this is the live action of ""Totally Spies"" right?...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie x xavier 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do I get this feeling that this movie will flop big time?
RSUq4VfWfjE,RIP ALL ANGRY MANBABIES IN THE COMMENTS 😂 This is going to trigger them so much
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm so glad that you can still get and watch the original Charlie's Angels on DVD because its a lot better than this crap and the angels were much more prettier,no diversity nor SJW BS didn't apply."
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi scott okay ill watchh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels (2019) Main Cast: Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Ella Balinska and Elizabeth Banks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,it looks really cool. Kristen Stewart be hot af <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,You cant get anymore millenial than that
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centino😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,kinda boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is she bonnie from the vampire diaries?
RSUq4VfWfjE,JZJSJSIAKJSJS NOAH CENTINEO❤😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow noah is everywhere these days and im not complaining
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart... Looks really furious with her stunts... Not bad trailler... Will watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Smh.. No. Where the thick bitches at though.. lmao all I see are sticks with guns
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is this going straight to Blu-Ray? If not, it really should. This is going to tank."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damnnnnnn 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love the references in the closet to the previous films
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What an unbearable crap is this! 

And remember boys, you shouldnt hit women, although they should be allowed to smash you..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Check out the Charlies angels trailer right now""... Said 2 seconds before the trailer starts.
Why are we constantly treated like idiots.
Charlies angels actors: ""we're pretty""
Me: Trust me, it's the only reason you were even casted and not because of your acting skills... Or a lack there of."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Release the damn song now
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mr Been as Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like yo....i wanna work here
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is so hottttt!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m a simple gay, I see Kristen Stewart with short hair in a movie, I go see it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is Riverdale level cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If the trailer was this boring, I dread to think what the final product will be like."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ugh, so no asian angel this time?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,hollywood actors why so smart..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will give it a chance. For Kristin and Elizabeth :D
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG really want this movie..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Snow White, Jasmin and ? In a one movie ♥️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:38 did she just try to copy Alex's iconic hair flip? Ohhh she didn't
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMIIIIIIIIII ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,wait for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart , YAY ❤❤❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hope they don't screw it up and that the action far surpassed the original reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie might be the one Kristen Stewart can actually comfortable acting. Twilight was just exploited her innocent which probably nonexistent
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Even in a movie about 3 female heroes, you just had to go and make the ONE MALE character a woman?!?!
SCREW YOU!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Respect Whamen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What a waste of a movie, no thanks!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here for naomi Scott...yeah
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will not even pirate this garbage it is a waste of bandwidith
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks and even sounds terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,@1:35 the height difference 🤣😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,We in it together but don’t call me angel 💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,am i the only one that liked this trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yaaaaa, not feeling this. 😒"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"nonton ini gara"" ada kristen stewart aja hehe"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Kristen so hot in this!!! But the song is kinda annoying to me
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART IS TOO POWERFUL IN THIS TRAILER
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait a second. Shouldn’t this be all men?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just WOWWW..... i literally love female centered movies.... showing their strenght not weaknesses... 💪
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Positive like to dislike ratio yet all the comments are negative, makes you wonder."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who ya gonna call?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen ❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As a 70s Baby, after one remake and a sequel to said remake, I was gonna say, “hard pass” but then... PATRICK STEWARD?!?! Daaaannngg why y’all wanna exploit me like that?! You know I can’t pass on Professor Jean Luc Xavier! 👨🏻‍🦲🤩🤣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aaahhhh my heart 💖😩
RSUq4VfWfjE,LEAVE CHARLIES ANGELS ALONE! THE ORIGINAL IS PERFECTLY FINE
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can it be classified as a remake if none of the ""angels"" are the same characters from the original. Asking for a friend"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sometimes the trailer is lack, random and deceptive, but then after I watch the movie, it's better than I've expect."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah this looks...... awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"those twigs of women couldnt hurt a flea,  passsssss"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really only want to see this movie because its got Noemi Scott in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Spice Girls Gone Wild. 💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Making so Girly with that music, oh My, why ?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,My name is alos angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Long Kiss Goodnight is still better
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Does not belong
They could have just used the 70s concept tbh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,directed by Elizabeth Banks screenplay by Elizabeth Banks also Starring Elizabeth Banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie with Kirsten Stewart's awkward bad acting. Why couldn't she end with Twlight...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pink ringer is a spy .
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only thing I thought when I saw the thumbnail of this trailer was a big....
*NO!*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t know what all y’all but I’m excited to see this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came for Lana Del Rey.
RSUq4VfWfjE,A Feminist Movie with physically overpowered Women who can beat up Men!!! Im so excited this has never been done before! (except for 215 times over the past 5 years)
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to KiLL mYsELf
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg Kristen Stewart is smiling!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,More crap nobody is going to want to pay for. That is unless they all flash often. Then perhaps.
RSUq4VfWfjE,literally no one will watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really love Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,PUTRI JASMINE AMA SNOW WHITE SALAH PERGAULAN
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is getting lazy man.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, because you don’t see Elizabeth Banks in enough terrible movies. Oh, and because the Ghostbusters reboot did so....horrible that another must be made!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,its jasmine!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like complete garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,"me alegra que hagan una nueva peli de los angeles de charlie, pero me gustarían que mejoren las escenas de pelea, por lo menos en el trailer se ven bastante ficticias."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The future is...............angel!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awesome! thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait a  minute  did Kristen Stewart say who steals  Eid money I hope it not my money😂😄😅☺
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey angles can it be my favourite  toy 😎✌
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well at least Naomi Scott is getting more rolls in the movie business
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Zack and Miri make a crappy remake. Great. 

I'll watch it along with Hellboy on Amazon in a couple monthd."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait, what? They didn't make Charlie to be a woman too? o.O"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Skip
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’ll wait until it hits home
Tho it was nice to see Mr.Stewart"
RSUq4VfWfjE,feat. DJ Chava Churches
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You might not like the movie trailer but, thankfully, no one cares. 
FULLY WAITING FOR THIS <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know I was getting ready to roast this to pieces...  But...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess jasmine❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WHY, just WHY?  Some things should just be left alone.. like seriously left alone- SONY isn't doing this Movie any favors by remaking it... AGAIN...feels a little less Charlie Angels and more Teenage Angels - Trailer is horrible, the cast make it look like another teenage action-comedy, I’m going to miss Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu, they at least had some type of stage presence...BOX OFFICE FAIL!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yo amo a Kristen Stewart pero no voy a ver ésta versión de los ángeles de Charlie. Las únicas ángeles de Charlie para mí son Cameron Díaz, drew barrymore y Lucy liu. De todas formas si por lo menos pusieran una actriz rubia, otra pelirroja y otra morena quizás escapaba pero ni eso!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had zero intention of seeing this movie until I saw the trailer today. Looks like so much fun.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bad Trailer, Bad Actress, Bravo Sony"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We wanted Charlie's Angels 3 with Drew, Cameron and Lucy not this bland reboot/remake/sequel, Hollywood. Nothing in this trailer feels like the original, it doesn't have the same atmosphere and these girls don't have screen presence, don't really stand out, blending into the background, somewhat lacking charisma. It would be like doing a Sex And The City 3 without the original women: STUPID!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Forever 21: The Meh-vie

RSUq4VfWfjE,"What's next? Hollywood reboots air wolf, barney Miller and welcome back kotter too? Folks,start coming up with original stuff, y'all cant hold a candle to the past greats."

RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg Noah Centineo.🤗
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, Jasmine is having a very great year. First Aladdin now Charlie's Angels. 

Trailer is cute but it's very hard to beat the Diaz/Liu/Barrymore/DestinysChild remake.

It's refreshing to see Kristen loosen up like this. At last."
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF?
RSUq4VfWfjE,why so many down votes? this looks great! lots of fun action girl power yeah!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please make a Totally Spies movie😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cast seems like they are fit for ""Totally Spies"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought this is ""Totally Spies"" Movie😋"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like a 90's Bond clone only with terrible music and three boring ""characters"" all looking like they're on valium. Oh, and they use guns now because lazy 🐸"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nope.
How about an original idea for once? Wouldn't that be new & different?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"cheap angels, pathetic"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If these are Charlie's Angels, then I am Thanos."
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks like it will be an okay film. Mostly reliant on a bit of star power.
RSUq4VfWfjE,A whole lotta NOPE!
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Oh oK i'm bout to pass out these 3 are literally my fav singers i'm-*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So......it's Kingsman, but just female agents, got it."

RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've read lots of comments saying that they miss the old Kristen Stewart but I think she looks so much better because she's finally being herself and I really don't care what haircut she has because she has such a beautiful face that she looks amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,YouTube removing dislikes?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll watch just for the hotness.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to bomb so bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,i mean it's not the same level as the original Charlie's Angels so it's either I'm gonna pass or I'M GONNA PASS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollyweird has gone PC. Elizabeth Banks is getting old and has to create work in order to work.  Screenplay, directed and staring Banks.
Bosley needs to be a guy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m tired of these cringe movies with terrible music. Should’ve gone with something like Red Lines by Bugs In The Dark.
RSUq4VfWfjE,R
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cringe, cringe, cringe!! 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hahahahah... Kristen Stewart get outa here! Lol

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Pinche Chava Iglesias es lo
Único que se ve bien en esta película"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"having flash backs to remakes of other movies...like Fantastic Four's last...dumpster fire...when will these studios learn from other studio's mistakes.  Although I am not surprised with the audacity in the industry that leaves studios thinking they can just re-release a movie with some garbage cgi added in here or there as a cash grab to beat another movie's record...the industry is getting too big for it's britches, and the consumers need to start making a stand and just - not - seeing everything they are fed from these idiots."
RSUq4VfWfjE,All of them are perfect for their role 😀😀
RSUq4VfWfjE,I looooooove it girls🌠🌠🌠
RSUq4VfWfjE,Plot twist kristen Stewart get into a relationship with Emma stone then cheat on her with the director
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott turned from a Disney Princess into a modern badass fighter in 6 months. I'm Speechless. That is not One Jump Ahead, that is 100000000 jumps ahead. A Whole damn New World.

RSUq4VfWfjE,I like it. Millennials Charlie’s angels 👼🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,Funny how as a movie its selling the new singles by miley lana and arianna lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is not Charlie's Angel ,it's Totally Spies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ftrwwtw etat
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please change the title to ""Totally Spies"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They look like Clover,Alex,Sam from ""Totally Spies"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They are a perfect fit for ""Totally Spies"" not for Charlie's Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here to just watch Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remember all of those people who demanded a woke Charlie's Angels reboot?






Me neither."
RSUq4VfWfjE,My opinion is 1:07
RSUq4VfWfjE,Name of the song in trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I believe Charlie is a portable speaker
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,TH😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Lesbians
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like it could be one of the worst films of the decade... I can't wait.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony make us a favor and put this garbage straight to VOD , Netflix ,hulu or Amazon this is why cinema is almost done , stupid remakes like this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Do you smell that?...
The cringe is in the air"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please no hate, just a joke..


Charlie´s Lesbos !!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bring back cameron diaz & lucy liu

RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WOW so you guys mean that the old movie with girls who’s pretending to be street dancers can be remade without any changes? AMAZING!!! even if lots of feminism movies came out, you guys failed to make any kinds of development."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missing Cameron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen Stewart so much...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who (Punch) Steals (Punch) Humanitarian! Aid! Money!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Three Lesbians playing tough girls and beatin up men? Pass, just watch Brazzers version instead!"

RSUq4VfWfjE,LMFAO news flash. This sucks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You're hyped, I'm hyped, we're all hyped"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a film I will never watch until I've watched every other film in existence first. Even switched off the trailer halfway through cos it was so bad lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even with a gap tooth she still looks gorgeous.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn! Kristen Stewart is so pretty!!!! 😄😄😄😄
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍😍 mereka keren gila.😍😍😍

RSUq4VfWfjE,....i'm confused...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This Movie is gonna suck Wonder Woman 2 is gonna be better
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Women can do anything""  Except lead in a film that people actually want to see."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so bad that I'm literally embarrassed for the actors/actresses.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have to much of a love for the actresses from the older movies. Looks mediocre at best.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If it is true that Sony and the director are forcing female agenda identity politics into this movie, Sony just lost my money. I won’t be seeing this steaming heap of crap."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t wait to NOT spend money watching this movie 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen has taken some acting classes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kok ga apik? Mungkin ekspetasiku terlalu tinggi
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Actually nobody is waiting for this serial, everybody is waiting for THIS FUCKEENG SINGL WITH THIS POP QUEENSSSZZ"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*slaps tin out of girls hand* ""Dont touch, everything here explodes""....  wait, what? THEN WHY THE F#^* ARE YOU SLAPPING THE STUFF THAT EXPLODES OUT OF THE GIRLS HAND YOU F#%*^ IDIOT?!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I do not have the words to explain how terrible this looks other than ""it looks terrible"" which is an understatement."

RSUq4VfWfjE,Shiet they’re going to smear this movie with PC and feminism crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t care for the movie I JUST WANT THESE SONGS!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Angels got Prof. X to walk again
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:08 is that noah centineo ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should've used the original theme song of charlies angel. Their new soundtrack is annoying and the trailer are just randomly picked clips. 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cmon u guys are being assholes, remakes is not the problem DUHH"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really really like the 0riginal 0f Charlie's Angel..Camer0n Diaz..Lucy Lu and Drew Brrym0re..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry but this looks rubbish
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The new generation of charlie's angels is superb...but old charlie angels( cameron, drew and lucy  still iconic💜✔💯😘😘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish it was Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu! Like Charlie’s Angels 3 haha
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now that's girl power💥💥💥
RSUq4VfWfjE,.....ohh no😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,The same Holywood that preaches women empowerment and metoo replaces women who can still perform with a younger cast of Instagram thots
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies anals is a much better movie than this .
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can sense the score on this will be awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMG it's ariana's voice!!!!!, can't wait for the OST"

RSUq4VfWfjE,This sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,guess the new world didn’t fit jasmine🤷🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no no no... I feel like its cheap... For some reason... But I'm a Charlie's angel's fan so I'll give it a try
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks bad in that 90's ""girl power"" sort of way. Surely there was a way to make this look less tacky and slightly more intelligent?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Red letter media, if you’re reading this, hi :3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood Flop of the Year 2019 award
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ll reserve judgement until I see it... for free... when it comes on tv 🤪
RSUq4VfWfjE,Escucharon la voz angelical de Lana <3<3<3<3
RSUq4VfWfjE,My mom's fave angel is Jaclyn Smith and mine is Lucy Liu. 😊I wonder who will be the favorite angel in this generation among my younger cousins.
RSUq4VfWfjE,clicked on it for  Bella Swan and gonna watch this movie only for her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More hoorah girl power bullshit.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fakest thumbnail of all time 😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Directer Elizabeth TANKS*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For a girl power rendition, I’m left wondering: why is Charlie still a man??! Come on now!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*No one will watch this.*
And no one will watch this because 
1. it looks boring
2. You have two nobodies starring alongside a somebody that nobody likes.
3. They arent sexy enough to Charlie's angels. 
4. Looks like feminazi garbage.

Lmao and you have a garbage Ariana Grande song playing with the words cDont call me an Angel"" lmao what? Who thought up that stupid idea."
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah centineo & kristin stewart 🥰🥰🥰🥰 my poor bi heart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looking damn fine.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I only see one Angel here, that's Kristen."
RSUq4VfWfjE,That black girl is too tall.  She looks odd with the other two.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok Power Rangers
RSUq4VfWfjE,all i hear from the song is Ariana Grande .. duhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bulls crap Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eheheh I just saw Connor or Brian Dechart from Detroit Become Human!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I will watch just for Kristen, hope it's better than the trailer suggests"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow.. way to kill a classic.. I can't even finish this trailer trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie look so great have no word  Girl spy are the best spy they are unpredictable don't want you will get can't wait for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The new CA cast could have been Gemma Chan/Constance Wu, Margot Robbie/Aubrey Plaza, and America Ferrera/Letitia Wright imo"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People in the comments are like ""they can't compare to lucy liu and cameron diaz, the og charlie's angel."" I'm like no the OG is the one from the 70s with farrah fawcett, kate jackson, and jaclyn smith."
RSUq4VfWfjE,اين اخوتي العرب هل انتم هنا✌🏻😌
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART IS COMING FOR BLOOD
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOMBS AWAY!!!!😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,If i don't get a cameo with Drew Lucy and Cameron im going to be pissed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ITS CRAP
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s gonna be a hard pass for me. Looks more like a cheesy VH1 pop music video. But I guess there will be a few people that will enjoy it and that’s okay.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This ruined my day
RSUq4VfWfjE,Low key actual really excited for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I watch this and all i think about is Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz and Drew.  Not a great subtitute, imo."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"She looks too Indian for Charlie's angel ,But she is a real angel 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They tried to do Charlie's Angels but it came out more like Kim Possible!😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just watched the trailer and I think I've already watched the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Movies that have been remade
Charlies angels
Scarface
Chucky
Robocop
Total recall
Hell boy
The italian job
Teenage mutant ninja turtles
The mummy
Judge dredd
The karate kid
Willy wonka
Spiderman
It
Annie
Tomb raider
Planet of the apes
Fantastic four
Blade
Dolittle"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll watch it. I loved CamDrewLucy version and I'm optimistic so I'll give this a try. Some people saying they dislike the trailer/actresses  will most likely watch it anyway.
RSUq4VfWfjE,K. Stewart is stealing the show.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, but no one can top Lucy Lu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore.

Plus, I can’t take Bella seriously here."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh brother give me a break 🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,courtesy flush
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Meh. No one can ever replace Cameron, Lucy and Drew."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whack music!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bull sh$$ movie! Hollywood is pathetic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This trailer has no focus. You might want to improve it. The whole thing just seemed ""Meh"" to me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So there's technically only 2 trained angel agents?  and the 3rd one is just a random civilian?  I guess that'll make for a more interesting dynamic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I've never been excited to see Kristen Stewart in a movie before, but I am now 😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,hake yeah
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow really disappointed Elizabeth Banks would accept this SJW BS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are Sony on a mission to lose as much Money as possible?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Phosphorus is an element, not a chemical"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why? Re makes of re makes now. Has the world ran out of new ideas?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""If it aint broke, don't fix it."" Is how I feel about this and many other remakes...still going to watch it though lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chava iglesias
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So how much propaganda is injected? If none, maybe I'll give it a view otherwise I'll just put it in my ""Aboid dis shiette"" list"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait🤩🤩🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,hell yeah sis
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well alright.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Vim pela Ariana Grande ❤❤❤😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remind me why I should hate this film? No, please. I get that it's a remake, but I thought this was a fun trailer. The actresses seem to be enjoying their roles and the jokes even made me laugh a few times. It's not the Godfather, but I think it's WAY more harmless than what people are making it out to be."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who on earth decided to make another Charlies Angel's....with actresses who can't act and have none of the charm of the originals?

This feels like a cheap teen movie and a bunch of girls just playing around with spy toys on screen.

The original Angels were straight up AWSOME. Beautiful, distinct, a hilarious, and 100% capable in just about any situation."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shouldnt this be 3 dudes?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie Angels look like dogs
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Never even seen Charlie’s Angels, I’m here because of Ariana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay this looks like CRAP  I’m I free to say so or is that against the community guidelines 😀
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m surprised they didn’t get a girl to play Charlie as well.
RSUq4VfWfjE,charlie's babies!!! lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"if you don’t like it don’t watch it, it’s so fucking simple, some of y’all are just dumb. and most of the comment i see are guys saying “this movie is gonna suck” or “i miss the old angels” like read the description, it says that there is more angels and more bosleys. but then again everyone is entitled to their own opinions"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks boring.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This just looks extremely dull.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels are... straight to video...
RSUq4VfWfjE,who the hell is the other 2 girls?
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:56 2:12 2:26
RSUq4VfWfjE,"is nobody talkin ab the Arianas angelic voice singin dont call me angel?? guuurl you are a fvcking angel, how the fvck should we call you??😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oof... that dialogue is completely terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1 second of an M134 shooting at that car and everyone in it would be shredded to pieces... just sayin'.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm confused... is this a reboot that nobody wanted or a wet dream that nobody wanted?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell no
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie is for lesbians straighties can stay mad
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG
RSUq4VfWfjE,so this is the new job for charlies xavier after x-men disband ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOTY!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I never am a fan of remakes but you got Banks directing so i'll see it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Robert is the New Batman, and Kristen is now a Charles damn am proud mam over here ..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am surprised no one brought up twilight in the comment section
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is probably one of the worst trailer's i've ever watched.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't get mad at me but all i see is Sam Clover and Alex
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not real...but empowering
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pro boxing? Nope not ever.
RSUq4VfWfjE,There something about Hollywood that will hurt you and that is believing what you see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't judge a girl by her cover""




How bout you kill yourself"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks so bad it's making people nostalgic for the 2000 version LMAO!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yet another movie where women pretend they are powerful. Too cute. But boring now that I have seen it literally in every action movie over the last few years. I'm tired of playing along.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow how original, Charlie's angels 3.0 . 3.0 are that how much it's gunna make. How about real Victoria secret angels by day an super spy's by night ,Candice An girls get together. I'am pretty sure 2 of these 3 are men dressed like women not fooling anyone."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Literally just here for the song and dance sequence
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not gonna lie, I might see this simply because Kristen Stewart looks so damn hot in this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't know why they keep making over these movies 😕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems really forgettable.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow ok 
Sure"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm watching simply cause one of my favorite mexican actors is in this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,*yassss*
RSUq4VfWfjE,If they keep the anti men crap to a minimum in the marketing then I'm in.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I honestly thought Kristen Stewart was Teresa palmer, they look alike"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The questions will be:
who are going to see the movie in theaters and who will wait to see on television?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG this is so lameeeeee!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can you imagine Lana, Ariana and Miley as Angels?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I might watch this when it comes to Pluto Tv.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Guys it’s a three minute trailer. Be skeptical if you want, but don’t blast it with hate before seeing it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This does not represent the Charlie angel, the ones I grew up with"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop having Twilight kill my childhood with these remakes!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder what kind of movie this is going to ... 0:08 ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is Saved By The Bell level content.  You can tell the script is horrendous just by the trailer alone.  This looks so bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,REALLY?!!!   They couldn't find anyone better than Kristen Stewart???   Yuck..........don't need to see this one until it goes straight to video.......................
RSUq4VfWfjE,BTW what are preferred pronouns of Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hi
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another feminist crap nobody asked for.
RSUq4VfWfjE,i already know this entire trailer by memory. so excited to see it premiere!
RSUq4VfWfjE,WOW!!!! Super))))
RSUq4VfWfjE,That wasnt bosley... Picard coulda been bosley but that wasnt bosley... 1.84btc says its gonna bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,it is weird when professor x is walking again
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is another “Baywatch” flop which will dominate the box office 🤠
RSUq4VfWfjE,MileyxArianaxLana I NEED THIS NOW
RSUq4VfWfjE,Might only see this movie because of Kristen’s emotions😂💀
RSUq4VfWfjE,The angles now use guns. They are upgrading now haha
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just awful, a propaganda movie for wahmen virtue signaling MeToo insanity.. ive lost all respect for Elizabeth Banks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Add this to my *Ones to Avoid* list. Don't care much for Liz Banks or Kristen Stewpot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Banks was quoted in an interviewing saying that even escapist entertainment needs to make a political statement.  No.  Nonononono.  How stupid do you have to be to think that?  I want politics out of everything I like to use to escape from politics.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What an irrelevant reboot. I am so sure they have already planned another irrelevant sequel and perhaps a cinematic university out of it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss the three most beautiful and original Charlie's Angels-Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jacklyn Smith"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i’m a simple human and fem led movies get me HYPED
RSUq4VfWfjE,nope it looks stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ridiculous ! NO THANK YOU.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does every movie nowadays look so bland and boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hi! Welcome to the comment section. If this is your first time here let me give you the run down on what's down here: People excited just to see Kristen Stewart/her showing emotion in a main stream film again; people commenting on how this is an unwanted reboot; people saying how they want the o.g. Angels, forgetting/not knowing Cameron Diaz is retired and Drew is producing this reboot; and lastly that 1 guy who wants the OG OG angels back. You are now caught up with the main points of the comment section"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why though?
RSUq4VfWfjE,boom boom boom!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow this looks fantastic




ally average."
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh...had some high expectation but meh..
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks awesome.....NOT
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For a few years now, I feel like Sony has lost their touch with movies. 
If I see a trailer with their logo in it, it now makes me very weary of the movie. 
I'm not sure if they're out of touch or I am. Either way, we're desynced and I think I'm done watching their movies (unless the critical reception is overwhelmingly positive)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do bad movies have great casts. I will never understand why talented actors will sign up for cringeworthy movies (other than money of course)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shouldn't be Asian woman there too ? Just saying
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First we get stupid super hero movies, now we get a movie where girls beat up guys, what is next  children  winning wars?  Too much fantasy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why’d they put Noah centino in this 😡
RSUq4VfWfjE,I mean Kristen Stewart ..I mean my dp...I mean...the hair-do..perfecto
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now that's what I call it sexy.. triple it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,i just want to hear the single
RSUq4VfWfjE,"how about Miley C,  Ariana G and Kristen S as Charlie's angels ..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG my number 1 favorite movie😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dislike this feminist reboot into the ground.. we are tired of garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You'll see this movie at the bottom of a Wal-Mart bin, underneath copies of Ghostbusters and captain marvel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was really awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks brutal... BOMB
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart doesn't get a credit?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood has no clue what to do. No thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart does have emotions 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,👍👍👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,who else is going to watch this just for Naomi Scott 😍??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They should have done a cameo of Drew,Lucy & Cameron.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,YOU’RE AN IDIOT!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Got bored watching just the trailer... nothing can beat the drew-cameron-lucy version
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waste of money to film this..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everybody has choices but that was CHOICE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh. Big fail😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,How is the third angel a rookie who has no idea what she’s doing?! 🧐
RSUq4VfWfjE,"mhh looks just like a standard action flick
so Bosley is a whamen now, but the angels arent men? not very diverse^^"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"More ""empowered women"" garbage from Hollyweird, and Bosley is supposed to be a man."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Glad my girl Naomi Scott's finally getting recognized
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has ghost busters written all over this 😂😂😂 massive flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dear director ...you just fucked up the franchise .....
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:06 did they use the same set that we see in 22 jump street?
RSUq4VfWfjE,idc abt the a remake I’m still watching this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is really running out ideas so they try to ruin the existing masterpieces
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:47 Is that Bonnie McKee - Bombastic ‽ ❤️❤️🧡🧡Love that song😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin and naomi is perfect casting
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yess Ariana yess them vocals yess Queen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomu Scott I live her for not long since aladin 2019 and she already has another mover with her in it in store 



Mind blown"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not woke enough. Where is the trans Angel? There needs to be a dude who identifies as a female on the team.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is a smoke show in this trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can watch this only to look at Kristen Stewart's face and study her makeup
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look bomb!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i'm here for only one reason, Kristen Stewart."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They finally learned to take An All female cast and make A sequel . Let’s just hope this one Doesn’t Flop Either .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Getting a oceans 8 vibe😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,The actor of the original Professor X is in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to see the ANGELS POST thoo.  Before the fight scene started 😂  🙏🙏
RSUq4VfWfjE,BADASSSSS 💓 💓 💓
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t know why but Kristen Stewart.... I can’t ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I expected worse after seeing all the complaints but eh...this doesn't look like it's hurting anyone so btw did you know it feAtures THE NEW SINGLE BY ARIANA GRANDE, MILEY CYRUS AND LANA DEL REY (?)???? whoa me neither. This changes everything guys..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Feminazi Charlies Angel movie: Don't call me angel!! ~♫


Me: I dont't watch this bullshit  ~♫"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mmmmm ""NOP"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Hollywood rebooting movies that don't need to be rebooted
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was scared that sexist dudebros will hack the dislike button like they did with batwoman.  Phew!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a ripoff of Totally Spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hi I’m a wattpad writer
@malayjahthewriter
''There she is,'' Mason sniffed the air deeply taking in her scent. It drove him mad. She smelled of cinnamon and vanilla. It was intoxicating, it was alluring, it was like a drug. He watched the girl sitting in the back of the lecture room intently. Her smooth, brown skin drew him in. Her big brown eyes caused his heartbeat to spiral out of control. Mason eyed her curves and her full thighs. She was absolutely stunning. Her thick hair was out and about, being controlled by only by a headband. He watched her annoyed expression as she pulled  a stray hair out of her face and tucked it behind her ear. He nearly smiled at the simple action leaving his dear friend Alex speechless. Mason never smiles.
  Before Alex could question his future alphas actions he heard a low growl. ''Mine....mate''"
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow I fell asleep
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nope, no thanks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂 All they do is remake. Im bored.
RSUq4VfWfjE,اححححححححححححح
RSUq4VfWfjE,do you think the angels are on the same menstrual cycle?????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does these people even know what computer programmers and MI6 agents look like ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,My girl Naomi Scott💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,who is charlie's angels other than kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,oke deh
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is gonna be sooooooooo terrible. That entire trailer was super cringy as hell. Also just pick a theme! Do you want to be a comedy or a serious action flick? Like pick something. The old Charlie’s angels is gonna be miles better than this. I’m gonna make a guess rn... this movie is gonna get a 12% on rotten tomatoes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A white girl, a brown girl and a black girl. Excellent"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think this kinda sucks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there no asian girl.
RSUq4VfWfjE,kinda gives me a totally spies vibe or idk just doesn’t give that Charlie’s Angles vibe yet.... BUT IT LOOKS BADASS THO 🙏🏼🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,How bout nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The music track over the entire trailer is annoying, almost like it’s propping up a movie that can’t stand in its own"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one excited for Kristen to be in this movie?!?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is a lot different here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another flop!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like yall are gonna make a fool of yourself messing with such an iconic movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yoooooooooo thats amazing 🎉
RSUq4VfWfjE,November??😮😩😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centino is literally in every movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,👏🙏💗
RSUq4VfWfjE,didnt like these 3 angels..not at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sexual Exploitation of Women , Graphic Physical and Gun Violence. If you support that kind of thing this is a ""Movie"" for YOU!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m confused by the negative reaction. This movie is obviously for a young female audience. It’s supposed to be fun and silly. This is not James Bond it’s Charlie’s Angles y’all are too uptight
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I mean it could have worked if it was not Charlie Angels and just a female spy movie 😐..

Too much drumming too much"
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi's character is closer to her personality here LOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,scenes between 54kg Kristen Stewart and some big bodyguards is just laughable
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Woke, feminist trash. Just burn money instead."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Okay our Ghostbusters with women reboot flopped badly, so what now?""
""..... Another Charlies Angels reboot?""
""GENIUS SONY STRIKES AGAIN"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pink ranger and green ranger together 😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,anyways im gonna go see this movie just to have fun and to spite all the men in the comments who hate women 😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"naomi: ohh mints 
guy: SMACKS IT DOWN and tells her not to touch it some of these blows up
me : WHATT?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,no one can beat the original i miss drew </3
RSUq4VfWfjE,So sick of Violence!
RSUq4VfWfjE,You’re gonna have Sir Patrick Stewart in two shots of this trailer and don’t list his name in the credit sequence? Talk about a misstep. I had to go back and watch again to make sure that was actually him
RSUq4VfWfjE,I recognize Kristen Stewart. I don't understand who the other two bimbos are. Did they go recruiting at the strip club? Did these other two girls have to give Harvey Weinstein a blowjob to get the part?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thanks for reminding me why i hate tv shows.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Emma Watson😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,The world as enough cancer as it is.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh jeez... they're gonna try to sensualize kristen stewart.
RSUq4VfWfjE,the only reason to watch this movie is kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ummm I already see a mistake that's not Ariana grande hahahaha thats Naomi Scott, Kristen Stewart, and Ella Balinska get the names right and I seen another that had Miley Cyrus lmao major typo!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,the worst cast ever.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Хуита....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"oh no, not the ""women fake beating men"" thing... why can't they keep it at guns and spy stuff? Its a spy movie, we can accept the made-up super spy, cuz it is fantasy, but the fight scenes between 54kg Kristen Stewart and some big bodyguards is just laughable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ooooh why is PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER in here😂 leisure time😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"so charles xavier tired of x-man and make a new squad with sexy ladies, while princess jasmine geting bored already of aladin"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one who thinks Kirsten Stewarts english accent and voice sounds like Alessandra Ambrossio of vs angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is really weird....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really hope this is not going to be a woke movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop giving women false expectations
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone ever watch Catch that Kid??
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am literally IN LOVE with Kristen Stewart!! But I'm confused. Is Naomi a client or one of them???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I dunno but Drew, Cameron and Lucy were absolutely amazing,,,I hope they can keep up :( don't ruin one of my favourite movie of all time pls : ("
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why isn’t there a plus size angel? Or a Asian angel? Big girls can be super dooper secret agents to. *feminist screaming intensifies*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I LOVE this. 💓💓💓 I watched the trailer sooooooo many times in a row, and feel I can still watch 6 hours of this trailer. Sooooo PUMPED for the movie to come out. Absolutely LOVE the cast too!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one can replace Cameron, Drew and Lucy!!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can't even make it to a minute and 30 seconds in the TRAILER!! 

HARD PASS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is not charlies angels it's just a action film with 3 woman in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angel:Respect Wahmen! edition looks cool.







NOT!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waiting
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be trash. They have NO CHARISMA. Should've just left Charlie's Angels as it ended in 2003. This is so insulting to previous Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,I rather watch the original thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,PROFESOR X?! GLAD YOU ARE ALIVE..!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Geez, this looks horrible"
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow so many views!
RSUq4VfWfjE,i smell flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like stupid fun, I’m in"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uhhhh... this trailer didn’t sell me, skipping past the first 10 seconds which I’ll just ignore it wasn’t it at all. Movie seemed like a bad remake and a joke at the same time."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. So weird lol bad casting
RSUq4VfWfjE,It was going really fucking great but then I saw Noah Centineo and I lost my hype
RSUq4VfWfjE,No more asian vibe 😔

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, a new trailer for another box office flop!  Yay!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noooooo not again. Can’t Sony make something new.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feministas United!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin is hott😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weak!!! Weak!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sam Alex Clover
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice Totally Spies!
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s 2019 and Kirsten Stewart still can’t act. This will be the year’s biggest box office bomb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,won't do well
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please don't hurt Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"best movies comes from the best directors

RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh wow this looks horrible :D
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG it's been a long time since the last time i saw K. Stewart in a movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyiing
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing about this movie feels like a Charlie's Angels movie, it's like taking an Oreos label and putting it on a box of chocolate chip cookies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Box Office Bomb. May as well call it right now.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I  can't believe I just watched this crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw the guy from netflix so I’m gonna watch..😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,The people complaining about Ghostbusters being remade with all women are going to be angry again.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this is the best combo ever , all 3 are my most favourite together............."
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s girl power in this one 👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m getting a Totally Spies meets Kingsmen vibe from this movie.  Looks entertaining.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosely is a black man
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girl power
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:47 that ""now"" was just shitty acting...

RSUq4VfWfjE,they gotta make the movie’s a bomb cause people are so hype just by looking at the trailer 😌😌😌
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Kristen Stewart* ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey kids remember that 70’s tv show that was rebooted into a 2000’s tongue in cheek, star vehicle? Well now it’s back as a mediocre action comedy heading straight for Netflix streaming obscurity! Yay!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart is so pretty, thank you"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can they stop remaking the same movies over and over
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I actually wouldn't mind seeing this movie. you know what would make sense a totally Spies and Charlie's Angel crossover movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen.... Ahhhgghhh 🙄🙄

RSUq4VfWfjE,any new you tuber here...subbed..subcribed me n i will subcribed u back......

RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg did Ariana Grande sing the song in the background?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks soooo sick omg I'm excited!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible. Maybe it won’t be.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh joy, more ""girl power"". Not like we haven't had this bashed into our heads for the last 2 decades. We know females can do hard jobs, stop screaming it at us. Or better, admit your true intentions because it sure as hell isn't equality."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A bad remake of a bad movie?
No originality, no story, no depth, no charisma?
No thanks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah... Hard Pass on this... It's a No for me...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie wants to be a big dump
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: *See the trailer... Two seconds after ""Don't call me angel"" 🤔..... (What?)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,it's a bomb (this movie)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it some new trend in Hollywood?
To make reboot trash nobody asked for?
Let me correct that, Im not gonna say its trash just yet, dont judge a book by its cover and all that but ""the cover"" looks like absolute garbage. 

Banks also said somewhere that ""we cant afford to not get political, not even in escapism entertainment""... well, then its not *escapism* is it? You absolute fucking imbecile. 

How are you *this* stupid yet for some reason youre on top of the world... These people gives my cancer fucking cancer"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The real name Charlie is Charles Xavier, thank you."
RSUq4VfWfjE,i thought this video is a parody
RSUq4VfWfjE,More toxic feminism in Hollywood. Thank goodness. We weren’t getting nearly enough in our movies and entertainment in this day and age.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is it with Sony and crappy movies these days?
RSUq4VfWfjE,No actress movies please who betrays love. Love is the reason of life and fuel to run oneself.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't hear any lana del rey's voice :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tits arse and guns, what more do we need."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even without the Strong Wah-Men tropes this looks like derivative trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:29 you mean Charles' (Xavier) Angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,stop hold a second  i am jean
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:52 This should blows up, because ""some of these blow up"" as this man gay said."

RSUq4VfWfjE,trash...
RSUq4VfWfjE,They'll do a male reboot in a few years time featuring a female Charli.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I've watched the originals then Cameron,  Drew and Lucy's version but I'm definitely not watching this cos of Kristen Stewart."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony pictures, not surprised"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this an xmen movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,What does that triangular design below the title represent?
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks amazing. I am definitely game.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sure replace the original asian member with a black one cuz diversity
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female Bosley? Ugh feminism 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just had to come on here to comment as soon as I saw this on my tv - totally hype for this!

Also, that song though! Who else got shooketh and had their weaves snatched when they heard Ariana and Lana del Rey?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too many remakes this year. Hollywood is running out of original ideas. This “girl power” idea has no factual basis as we observe transgender women (biological males) smash the women (biological females) in almost every sport.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart look like a joker in another universe.. no, not harley quin but joker, would be cool tho.. and why ranger pink in here?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a bad trailer. No focus. Just a bunch of random clips.
RSUq4VfWfjE,will it release in India??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait...this is why people are “turning” on Noah Centineo?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original angels are still the best....
RSUq4VfWfjE,i miss drew barrymore and lucy liu
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Couldn't even bear the whole trailer, wondering how shitty the movie will be."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks super cool. Fell in love with Kristen Stewart all over again
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen so fuucking much
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That was a terrible trailer, horrendous.. ""whoever approved the edit should be fired"" bad

but I'll still watch the movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a horrible trailer. I hope the movie is much better. Still have hope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,FLOP.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i just finish watching charlies angle movie.
dont want to be rude so thats the end of my statement."
RSUq4VfWfjE,DID I SAW NOAH CENTINEO THERE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks bland but I’ll watch for Elizabeth Banks and Djimon Hounsou 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Kristen Stewart is the most exciting part of a movie you know its fucked up 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can't wait this movie, I love  the old Charlie's Angels but this version looking so fresh! I love it~💕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Release one more trailer, you don't have to go to the theatre to watch the movie :P"
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOOOOOOO!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has got to be a tax ride off. The only explanation.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"you already had 3 female leads to work with in this IP, why do you always have to push the woke points?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,worst remake ever?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell yeah it's back
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks plain typical, these girls don't have screen presence like Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Apart from Kristen everybody looks whack
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do I think that Rihanna must be there???!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's really awesome movie. I seen another Charlie Angels movies Drew , Lucy and C Diaz."
RSUq4VfWfjE,two White girls then the Black girl replaces the Asian chick
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mo rly out here flexing on the rest of lemonade mouth
RSUq4VfWfjE,If it's okay I think I'll sit this one out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,they dont look mature enough
RSUq4VfWfjE,Give me Lucy Liu !!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can see this becoming another 2016 Ghostbusters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just because women can,""MEANS THAT THEY SHOULD. Do ANYTHING WANT."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow wow wow damn 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jane: (Flirting with Noah Centineo)
Sabina: are you flirting with a handsome nerd??
Me: no honey, she's flirting with a HOT nerd 😍😍😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn they took out the diversity, not surprised but its a damn shame smh....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would rather have an angry rotweiller bite my Balls than to see a robotic dude like Kirsten Stewart act like a women and watch the other two hermaphrodites ruined my childhood.. 😭😭😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,I loooove badass Kirsten....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where's the all male angels like Oceans 8, Ghostbusters and Terminator? I thought Hollywood is in to gender bending. I smell hypocrisy and double standards on their part."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Na!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh why can’t Kristen have the long hair she looks way more hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi scott ❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie stopped being kickass the moment i saw Noah centineo🤦why directors why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Prof.. what are you doing here? 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not my charlie angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow that looks like just as much garbage as the original. great job
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Waitt... when look at kristen, suddenly lesbiannn"
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks dumb lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow talk about ruining Charlie’s angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is anyone else getting tired of Elizabeth Banks putting herself in her own movies or is it just me? I'm feeling this movie either way
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't believe they remade Charlie's Angels with an all female cast. What's next? Ghostbusters?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels: Feminist Edition... CAAAAAAANCER...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So a reboot, of a remake, that no one asked for... Okay"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excited much 😍😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boooooo!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus & Lana Del Ray*
The real Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can't wait for this movie, it looks amazing. Love kristen Stewart."
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:29 the worst pose
RSUq4VfWfjE,Congratulations on officially ruining Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,The dialogue is so cringy 😞😞
RSUq4VfWfjE,DUDES WITH BOOBS IS STILL A DUDE
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You: omg?! Is tht you noah??????

Me: WOAH, WOAH, WOAH 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""My name is Charles Xavier ... """
RSUq4VfWfjE,One has been and two nobodies.  Must be the only way to profit form a movie nobody wanted.  Make it for $5.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who missing Cameron Diaz 😞😞😞 hit like here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Finally, a Charlies Angels movie that empowers women and doesn't have any of the things we liked about Charlies Angels 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
RSUq4VfWfjE,COULDN'T EVEN WATCH THE TRAILER TILL THE END ! SMH !
RSUq4VfWfjE,The old angles  were far better...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow.  This strikes me as... boring.  Really, remarkably boring.  Like a mediocre spy-fi TV show from a decade or two in the past inflated into a movie.   Like it made a half-hearted attempt to recapture the dumb goofiness of the previous films without losing its brain, but instead of coming off as more intelligent it's just amazingly bland.  It lacks either the flair to look fun or the sophistication to look intriguing.  Well, only time will tell, but the trailer sure isn't blowing me away."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woah another forgettable movie cash grab bravo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart you beauty 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really Sony...you couldn't include an asian girl? Bigots
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Come on, even old Cameron, Lucy and Drew could do it better!
But still looking like angels, not like feminists 🙄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Annnnnnnnnd it’s no for me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Use make up then use more make up then gossip with girls then put more make up and kill a bunch of girls. Stupid!! Liked the older Charlie’s Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously? People are still employing Kristin Stewart to ""act""?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The remake I never knew I didn't want.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hi
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is way hotter with short hair 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Reverse the genders in the opening 30 seconds of this trailer and it totally changes the perception of who the antagonist in the movie is. And since that is the case, it also highlights the inescapable fact that men & women are not the same (no matter how much this or any other Hollywood movie attempts to say otherwise)."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this kicks like crap lol.  Get better actresses.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna tank sooooo hard....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Offbrand Kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Indonesia❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is why movies suck so damn much. It’s either a remake no one asked for or a spin off no one asked for lmao .
RSUq4VfWfjE,why not megan fox??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi's character is just cuteeeeee HAHAHAHAHA just fell in love with her princess jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another trash flop movie. Get some ideas and do something new instead of ugly remakes with bad actresses
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“Don’t Call Me Angel” 

Seriously 😒?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am waiting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bonnie Mckee's bombastic!!!!! Wow!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,While I enjoyed the last two Charlie's Angels movies I can't help but feel that I'm a bit outside of the target audience for this one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen acting in an action movie is something i've never seen coming
Impressed , always liked you ☺️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The movie is going to flop. With this sjw ""believe women"" garbage, you're not going to have a male audience. How are virtue signaling movies doing these days. Ever wonder why movie theater attendance is at an all-time low? let's see if you prove me wrong when this movie comes out."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m going to give the movie a chance but this cast is so extremely bland to me.. it was hard to ignore
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi my queen 🖤❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yasss Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,I AM WATCHING THIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have no words...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like one of the worst movies ever made.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just waisted 2.53 sec of something that's not worth of watching.  Stock to my old movie. Thank you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Huwawww... She's come back..bella twilight ...crazyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s made for millennials and teenagers .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another bad remake after MIB:International? We shall see :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙄🙄🙄🙄🤭🤭🤭🤭😦😦😦😦😦🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😒😒😒😒😒😔😔😔 at least the girls pretty
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tell me why I’m more attracted to short haired Kristen Stewart than Noah centineo rn?? YALL LIT MADE HIM LOOK SO UNFLATTERING! A HUMAN THUMB! WHY AM I SO UNATTRACTED TO HIM HERE WHEN I MELTED IN “TO ALL THE BOYS I LOVED BEFORE”
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,ARI!! OMG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyone please subscribe and tune in to my videos thank you 🙏🏾
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks super corny and Hollywood loves casting yellow/mixed chicks who barely look black as the token black.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Barf barf barf 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish we could post memes on the comment section. So I could express my exact emotion.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"its a Totally spice the movie?
whos with me?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow...this is gonna flop so bad....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When Kristen Stewart looked directly at the camera and said ""I think women can do anything"", I felt that."
RSUq4VfWfjE,How about Hollywood starts writing interesting characters - not cardboard cutouts - NOPE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Get woke go broke👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters
RSUq4VfWfjE,yes! another ellen movie 👌😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks garbage and cliche zzzzzzz
RSUq4VfWfjE,this would have been really interesting if they made it dark and gritty. it doesnt look interesting at all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,These woman don’t suit the movie... should have got mila kunis and Emma stone!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pretty obvious from the comment section that they’re manipulating the dislike ratio lmao when will it stoppppp
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look like they stink!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like the likes are being boosted already.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen gonna rock it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Are you flirting with a nerd?! 
-umm he's handsome for a nerd"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awful trailer. Way too messy for my taste.
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂 look like a stud and two fems 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I kinda wished they use the 70s Charlie's angels theme. Hope they do in the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The government needs to shut Hollywood down for ten years and let them come up with new ideas.
RSUq4VfWfjE,KSTEW❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can they show this to CW to understand what they twatted up with Batwoman...THIS is woman power done correct 👌🤘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wonder how many women are going to get beat up because Hollywood has fooled them into thinking they are just as physically strong as men. Women have a lot of positive qualities, why does Hollywood insist on showing women choking and punching men? It's dangerous and dumb."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Cameron Diaz Lucy Liu and my girl Drew !
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible. That’s all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie better have top notch yet outrageous disguises or I will cry
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y’all tripping this doesn’t look so bad. I’ll definitely be going to see it 🤷🏽‍♀️💯
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where are the real 👼 Drew, Cameron and the beautiful Asian girl? 👀😓 not feeling this one!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So when this movie inevitably flops is it going to be my (white male) fault again? I'm still taking the blame for ghostbusters and oceans 8. I guess I'll just prepare myself for this one too, the toxic male that I am."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait did that song say don't call me an angel? But they are........... hmmmmmmmmmmm.............. is it sexist to call the angels an angel or anyone for that matter?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Surprised they didn’t use the the Charlie’s Angels theme
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know about this one, Chief. I have so many questions."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ya. The next ""powerful women"" Movie nobody asked for."
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,If charlie in the past is still charlie now?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm a programmer and can confirm we don't say ""iM aN eLiTe pRoGrAmMeR"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Get Woke go Broke!
RSUq4VfWfjE,TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gonna go straight to dvd...this movie sucks..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trashhhhhhhhh🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omg this remake is totally unnecessary. If u want the angels back bring the real ones: Cameron, Drew and Lucy. Forever iconic 💕💕💕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,There's cringey then there's so cringey it's pukey. This trailer is pukey.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should've done the same thing they did with Ghostbusters and made them the opposite sex. See how changing something from a previous movie will be recieved by the audience
RSUq4VfWfjE,you can just tell when a movie is going to be atrocious
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know why people are being so pessimistic over this movie. I think it looked great. All of the girls looks amazing and I love the concept! Honestly, can't wait to see it 😊"
RSUq4VfWfjE,lets just appreciate how pretty kristen looks with long blond hair
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This trio don’t feel as close as diaz, liu and barrymore."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Un asco femisexista
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer gives goosebumps to pseudo feminists
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like this would have made more sense (and money) if it were released to Netflix instead. It’ll prob tank
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm a simple wlw, I see kristen stewart, I click"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“Women empowerment!” 
*proceeds to talk about clothes, shoes, wigs, and boys*
This looks cringeworthy at best and shows that Elizabeth Banks may be a little too full of herself."
RSUq4VfWfjE,i liked the movies with Drew and Cameron.  i liked the TV Series when i was a preteen girl but this looks .....ugh.  no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm tired and sick by Hollywood representing Turkey(especially İstanbul) like it's an Arabic country. Learn the culture or don't include it in your movie .THAT SIMPLE!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart's is  acting likes she is still in twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will be teenage Charlie's Angel... 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another film for the trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was ready to drop this trailer and then Patrick Stewart showed up. And then he was barely in it, so I ended up dropping the trailer."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks really really bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ok just me having a guess here cause I haven't looked at all the comments yet but I can tell its gonna b a mixture of people hating this movie but are still going to go see it or people just straight shitting on this movie cause the original was better or 3 every guy typing ""only females are going to watch this trash cause they'll feel empowered"" I like it and I think it will b a decent enough movie to have a sequel announced months after this movie comes out"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m actually excited for the movie. All these old farts just want to watch the same thing over and over again 🙄 I’m ready for some new faces and I’m excited to see Kristen Stewart again!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel Elizabeth Banks as Bosley. I don’t feel the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They reshot all the best  scenes  from Kingsman with women ijs
RSUq4VfWfjE,"looks generic and wil be full of collectivistic politics again, which comes from people calling themselves liberal as to not admit to what they really are"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another remake I'll never watch...do something new Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Am I the only actually willing to give this movie a chance? So much hate in the world now a days, I don’t know how all you behind the screen warriors have the energy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm seeing a few things about the guy taking the bomb from her hands and onto the floor. But he said ""Some of these"" while he looked and pointed around and he told her to stop touching everything, so maybe that one wasn't part of the devices that exploded, and it was instead his way of making her stop touching things."
RSUq4VfWfjE,this trailer is like a horrible music video for this song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don’t judge ANY gender by their cover.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I liked the old Charlie’s Angels with Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz better because they’re more fun and entertaining."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gimme back Diaz, Lyu and Barrymore"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please tell me this is not another SJW modern feminist film designed to belittle women through the use of false empowerment by hating on men? It’s a disgusting disease that’s running rampant in Hollywood right now
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow Such a pure trash... Is their no other better actress who knows acting   in Hollywood to play the roles of angels? 

Can anyone tell me what kind of bomb will this be in theatre ?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not a chance 👎🏾
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Awful...just awful. Kristen ""Twitchy"" Stewart."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope. Not going to waste my money to see this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So it’s a remake of a remake. Except no Bill Murray. It’s a female lead movie which is awesome but it’s now even more so. Ok sounds great.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I refuse to believe that the thumbs up/down numbers are accurate
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame!  Skip this like ghostbuster.
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:26 Best part ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,The songs they are starting to use in movies are getting worse and worse. Sounds cheap and shitty.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks terrible.  They've taken a great concept and turned it into Burger King's kids club of political ideology that people hate.  They felt the need to replace John Bosley into a wahman even though the majority of the main cast is already wahmen.  They just need to make this movie like the original series that was successful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Truly a golden age of cinema
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie about women wanting to be like and pretending to be men.  lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super ultra omega worst cast decision
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woah naomi scott you got me
RSUq4VfWfjE,More leftist horse water. I appreciate the warning....ahem I mean trailer though
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, well it would be better if they used their Own Bodies. I think, i would be more Entertained.......!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier must need money
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not here for it. Drew, Lucy, and Cameron are always gonna be the best!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,UGH!! .. .. 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im here cause of lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing beats the original angels, this is just going to be like the 2016 Ghostbusters film, another try and fail"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m out. 🤦🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You: Kristen Stewart


Me: MILEY CYRUS, ARIANA GRANDE AND OF COURSE MY BAE NOAH CENTINEO 😂😘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this movie??
RSUq4VfWfjE,i came here for lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,....Kristen Stewart is kinda hot in this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible!! Big pass for me. I struggled to get through the whole trailer. = /
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow this music video is bad! Falls into the same flop box category as the all wahmen ghost busters,  RIP."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Those 3 are about as intimidating as a box of fluffy kittens..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just here for Ariana’s song😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay where the hell is Taylor Lautner???? Two of his former costars have both gotten huge movies now. What is he retired???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is gonna bomb at the box office, sorry.
It should have been a serious style action movie like Jason Bourne or Wick. Oh and a better cast."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont see why people are so upset about three women fighting crimes. They're not the first ones to do so and this movie isnt feminist at all compared to other movies I've seen come out this year.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ONLY WATCHING THIS BECAUSE OF JONATHAN TUCKER 👊🏆🏆🏆🏆
RSUq4VfWfjE,American movies and films are so unbelievably cringe ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,cancer
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm already in love with this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who Charlie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great another franchise ruined
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's Yasmine doing here???
RSUq4VfWfjE,ok but where is the song? also not enough Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oof
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First you ruined Charmed for me with that new..crap to put it nicely and now this too? :/ Come on, I would rather watch the other charlie's angels than this..hell I think i'm going to right now. Has none of flare/feel and I have a feeling this shall suffer greatly once released :( Just a guess though, hope i'm wrong :/"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does this mean we get another shitty tie-in game? :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, I threw up in my mouth several times, this looks horrendous! Is there a originality vacuum in Hollywood?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only reason why this show won't last is ""Bella"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just because you can reboot Charlie's Angels doesn't mean you should
I'm talking to u Hollywood"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who wanted this movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kimberley and Rita
RSUq4VfWfjE,Glad that Kristen is getting to show her acting skills what with all of the trolling she goes through for Twilight.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Youtube has been removing the dislikes. They removed mine LOL
Take another one"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters 2! Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wigs Wigs Wigs everywhere...
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look skinny
RSUq4VfWfjE,Remember when she played Bella in twighlight?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, this looks... pretty fucking awful. Who woulda thought."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen ♥️♥️♥️♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course they have flawless complexion even after head butting someone.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So apparently Kristen Stewart is hot now. Damn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Garbage. Only place where women can ""win"" is with hollywood woke special effects with rubbish story and bland boring characters"
RSUq4VfWfjE,You mean they didn't do a reverse gender cast for this remake?  Why not hollywood? what about equality??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson, Jaclyn Smith are still the best angels....nothing beats the original angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People complaining about the mints when he specifically said stop touching because SOME of the things blow up, not necessarily the mints. 😂 🤷🏻‍♀️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer does not look like an Movie trailer.its look like an TV show or Something...and You cannot match the real Charlie's Angels Level eVer Ever in Your Life....👎👎👎👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey, I would like my 2:53 minutes back PLEASE!!!! Thanks"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was gonna say no... then I saw Kirsten... Yes please! 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Someone please help Hollywood, because they can't write anything original anymore.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I should have read the comments first yall are a bunch of cucks if u think this is entertainment
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hahaha a bunch of sexist and racist women try to teach us a lesson? Im out lol this looks like garbage😛😝😜
RSUq4VfWfjE,The dislike button was't so hard to find.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's my Angels :((
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was too distracted by Ariana Grande singing in the background and when I saw her name I became hyped. 😅😂 


*The trailer looks great*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"At least i don't need to watch this trash, because the trailer gives away the whole story."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another re-make?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Every time I see Kristen Stewart on screen , I am amazed by her acting style....she is totally different....and I think soon becoming my favourite angel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm going to give this movie a chance. Worse case scenario it gets pulled out of the theater.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When your Son drops you from the sky to die then you ressurect to become an Angle of charlies...
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Netflix has finally released Noah Centineno huh…
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to go up to these girls and say “sorry I have a boyfriend.”
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok cool trailer..but i miss the old trio
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s gonna flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,wheres the redhead?
RSUq4VfWfjE,indiawale
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is 2019. Y’re we still casting women to play female roles? There’re plenty of transgender women out there who’re in need of work. Bigoted and transphobic. I will boycott!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The trash of the decade
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just here to see Noah Centineo 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tottaly spies ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,2 angel and 1 lesbian
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:21 Kristen blinks uncomfortably a lot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now we just need Elizabeth Banks to star as all of the characters in the film.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Have any of u actually watch a Charlie's Angel movie cos y'all seem to be confused
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im looking forward to It. Perfect movie to get in the mood for Halloween
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow charlies angel  i love miley cyrus and arianna grande ...excited much to see this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see the X-Men weren't working out so Charles Xavier decided to try a different approach.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks What has the world done to you to make you hate us so much ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Piece of shite !
RSUq4VfWfjE,damn gorgeous
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I used to think no one can take my heart except Cameron! But you did, Kristan! You become my love! <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Welcome back Charlie’s Angels
With new girls now"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh damn Noah C.!!❣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie remaked and destoyed by SJW's and Feminists.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Written, directed, produced, and starred in all by the same person? Who does she think she is? Tommy Wiseau?
Get woke go broke, another sony flop"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"These girls just don't cut it for me. They don't really stand out, blending into the background, somewhat lacking charisma. Guess the previous ones are just too iconic."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So... when does this series premiere on the CW?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im I the only one who thinks Naomi Scott is bad!? Even in Aladdin.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i wish they let Naomi keep her British accent. she never seems to have a chance and speak in her natural accent.
Also, why they cut out the Asian Angel? cant there be 4 of them?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well time to short sell the stocks of whoever produced this future bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is going to be a pile of hot woke garbage, I'm calling it now"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Go woke.  Go broke.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Smells like a bigggg fail is coming......
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart looks nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When hollywood will understand their movies are show in other countries, like mine and we don't care about their political views and I refuse to pay to see a movie full of political propaganda about a country I don't live in.  I can't vote in usa, People in china can not vote in usa. You know? So stop sending us your propaganda. And political propaganda is free on my country and I think it should be on yours. Is disgusting how you charge people 15 usd for a movie that is not entretainment but your political view. You have mo shame!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait! 💜
RSUq4VfWfjE,More reboots with more women..... snoooooore... just watch all the feminist bull
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a porn parody
RSUq4VfWfjE,charlies angels..... groundbreaking....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks boring... Kirsten Stewart tho 
Of all people though"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like utter shite. Who tf even considers Kristen nowadays. 🤦🤦🤦
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one feeling something is still missing?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Robert Pattinson?lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,My attraction to Kristen Stewart cant make me pay to see this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,My favorite part is seeing Noah 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't judge a movie before you've seen the movie,that doesn't make sense.

The Cast has a great chemistry,thy are all talented.

And Kristen is already a great actress,get it into your brains,you have definitely watch more than a 10 year old 
franchise, specially when there are more than 40,and even more if the director says she's the best."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait what is Juan Carlos doing here ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,สนุกครับ อยากดูเต็มเรื่อง
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks stupid AF!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Saw 20 seconds if this and clicked off. Im not seeing this flick.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Totally Spies generation has arrived y'all
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Elizabeth Banks in this movie? I couldn't tell...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow way to ruin Charlies Angels. Horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony you're wasting your money again.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If they don’t shoehorn forced feminist propaganda, this might actually be a fun movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So I'm gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Look, Hollywood. It's simple. Put Kristen Stewart in movies where you let her look her hottest, and I'll give you money. Any questions?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Everything was bad until Elizabeth banks showed up, then it got worse"
RSUq4VfWfjE,can’t wait for kristen stewart 😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,Snow White and Jasmine spying when not in Disney Princess mode 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist bullshit. At least put attractive hoes in there if you’re gonna do that. Not these ugly men
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart somehow manages to still make every scene awkward and boring. She's the same character in every movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woke Charllies angels. Thanks for let us know in the first seconds so we don't waste our time.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Use me as ""WTF, IF YOU DONT LIKE THE REMAKE DONT go to see THE MOVIE"" 
button"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Also women can do anything ... Like fxxx some other woman's husband right Kirsten?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uugh..... not again. There’s enough trash out there for movies right now without having to put this giant turd out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lizie as much I love you...I already hate your movie!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Has humanity ran out of ideas? Reboot after reboot. Only Saint John Wick can save us from this...
RSUq4VfWfjE,......oh boy smfh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just love Kristen Stewart, super pretty"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to tank at the Bo
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Step 1 is Get Woke.
Step 2 will be coming this November to a theater near you."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im waiting for the song ahhahahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,The funniest part was they were keeping a homosexual in the closet
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 the year of the remakes 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crrrrriiiiiinnnnnnge
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY NO ONE ASKED OR WANTED THIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be bad. Not even close to the original angels 🤦‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah Bella is Charlie's angel!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why does this looks

RSUq4VfWfjE,I only hear LEGO Movie whenever she talks now
RSUq4VfWfjE,a boring version of charlies angels..this movie should be FUN not BORING!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mmmmeh
RSUq4VfWfjE,yeah you get that 2019 movie remake vibe...and of course ArianaGrande it make perfect sense
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks like complete trash. Even Patrick Stewart can’t save it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yawn more of the same ""woke"" hollywood garbage"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dunno if i should be happy or sad..
Well we'll see..
Plz don't make it another disaster remake!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah is on the screen 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOT! MY! BOSSLEE!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't like the cast
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Angels of feminism...
Jeez, this propaganda is so artificial and uninventive!
Just show them like professionals, instead all these uncovered phrases about ""girls power"" right in the face. You know, like in old movies. And it will be more NATURAL!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I Love Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,No not  even close
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should’ve just made a live action of totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"TBH ""I didn't get that vibe like goosebumps or excitement just an regular"", no offence."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:00 Disney channel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I could never forget she cheated on him. Poor Robert Pattinson.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does anyone know how to make a noose? asking for a friend.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, atleast all the angels cast are not white!!! Now we got African and Indian too!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*feminism has joined the chat*
*balance has left the chat*
*Thanos has gone to bathroom* :("
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is not sexy at all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pubg chicks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another senseless male bashing film.  Why can't movies with strong female leads be that...and not have to scream ""WE SOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN THESE MEN HERE!!!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess I'm the only one who is actually excited for this......
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not for everyone. Only those who haven't seen Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore will like the movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok I was a fan of the original Charlie's angel movies and I can see that they replace some of the roles here.. and wow Kristen Stewart with emotions?? I never thought that I would see the day.. 😅😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woke BOMB!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Idk what to say......... and why ofc, the soundtrack must be by those nowadays female singers😏😏😏😌😌😌"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i only came here for naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where the black trans furry so homophopic
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart is such a hottie 💞
RSUq4VfWfjE,YASSSSS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, let’s see how the misogynists are gonna reveal themselves..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"trash. Get Woke , Go Broke ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,She's come a long way from singing at a pizza restaurant
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Girl power , yeah bullshit"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So no Asian angel this time? Hmmm.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That’ll be shite
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should have inserted an asian chick .
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, better remake everything instead of coming up with new original stuff. Thanks, I'll pass."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:02

Freaking ILLUMINATI
inverted triangle symbol at the beginning of the trailer



GIMME A BREAKK!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies~~~
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it ""Spice Girls"" filming?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,frozen 2 seem more promising than this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love Elizabeth Banks in everything, she's super talented, funny, sexy and beautiful, but this gonna flop to the next dimension."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even the trailer looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's weird to see professor X walk again😐
RSUq4VfWfjE,From Power rangers to a princess to a spy. Wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well....that was embarrassing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will we finally see Charlie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another Charlie's Angels reboot ...why has Hollywood still not woken up to the fact that Modesty Blaise is out there just waiting for a proper treatment?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I've always admired women because they operate on a better plane than men; less aggression, less need for violence or competitive  compulsions, ego etc. With that in mind, I do not understand why the current wave of feminism is trying so hard to emulate everything wrong with the male species. It's kinda awkward to watch."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is Illuminati
RSUq4VfWfjE,How is it that this is one of the most feminist things I have seen in a long time -_- like noramally I keep potical issues out of movies but this has to be the most obvious feminist thing I have seen since that scene in avengers.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I See Future Batwoman 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant wait to watch this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤💜
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG Kristen Stewart 💕😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hahaha, got what I expected here, lesbos and sjw's have ruined another classic. Like a lot of movies today I won't watch, only media and snowflakes care about this crap, 70% thinks it's stupid and divisive to continue shove crap this down kids throats."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey! Ms. Stewart looks fire in a blonde hairdo.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Less africans, less violence more clothes and titis and cammos."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just leave my child hood alone camren Lucy lu drew just not the same
RSUq4VfWfjE,another feministic bullshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg kristen and Naomi together
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott : from a princess to a badass agent hahahahhahaaaa
Defo watch this ><
Not only the new angels, the song is superb as well!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uhhh...no thanks. This looks so bad. I get a Hollywood has some sort of remake funk going on but this just looks pathetic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why have 3 bosley in this Charlie Angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Their leader is a man I bet he is evil
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I feel I,e I have seen this oh right kingsman got copied.... welp a5 least  this is womaized kingsman"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dislike
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missing cameron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I like Kirsten Stewart in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks mingin
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a taste
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks so lame.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn. Another agenda driven reboot. Believe wahmen my arse.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girls 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Soon, MIB International Sequal 😂😂 Time for Disney to buy sony"
RSUq4VfWfjE,From Twilight to Charlie's Angel (Kristen Stewart)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am sorry, something wrong with this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony has a bad reputation for rebooting they don't know how to just  everything over in every sense
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine is in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think the reason i would actually watch this movie is bcus Kristen Stewart in it 😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eww.   The smell of DOA.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood....PLEASE STOP AGENDA PUSHING
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Anyway, November, is near already. 😂👍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like this new take on Charlie's Angels.... three actresses with no charisma in the title roles. Bravo, Hollywood."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That's strange, I see no angels here.
All I see is WHAMEN."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can tell this movie is going to suck by the song that played during the whole trailer. Looks cheesy as hell
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart looks so awkward !  When she throws puches, or moves around,   I don't know why this girl is so awkward with herself all the time,  and she chooses acting for a profession?  And her expression on her face is always the same...   She looks like she never wants to be doing what she is doing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was worried my phone would melt.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Really ?

Don't judge a girl by cover💪👍👏"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is gorgeous.
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who is your Favourite Charlie's Angel

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Actually, fornme its kinda sad that there's no Asian girl, like Lucy Liu huhuhu"
RSUq4VfWfjE,we want drewbarrymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,B. A. D.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Do I even need to go see this movie now? The trailer showed everything
RSUq4VfWfjE,only thing I don't like is Ariana shitty voice :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think the older is better than the new one🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't Call Me Angel 😇
 Charlie's Angel is Back 👊
Who is Comment on This Trailer 💬"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t care if this turns out to be bad because Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least the Cameron Diaz/Lucy Liu/Drew Barrymore Angels movies were fun. This one just seemed cringey.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am happy seeing Kristen looking a woman again even just in movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,tina fey /kevin hart would have been a great bosslee
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine is a Charlie's Angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bullshit ..i must say 👯
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Bossly becomes a woman 😅😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop

RSUq4VfWfjE,they blew it as soon as they cast noah centineo. hes so overly used in everything
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does it gives me totally spies vibes?
RSUq4VfWfjE,And there's Noah Centino.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I CAN'T FUCKING WAIT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Kristen Stewart why...😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,From Vampire to Angel.....Kristen Stewart is woowowowoowowowowow...
RSUq4VfWfjE,That song in Background is the only reason I watched the trailer for 10 times😍.Ariana and Miley are just rocking 😈
RSUq4VfWfjE,Directed by James Cameron
RSUq4VfWfjE,There's no chills or excitement
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen S My Love :).
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm seeing the movie for Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop just.. stop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remakes, remakes, remakes, and even more remakes. 

This generation is not as creative."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen ❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Poor remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sexiness is unreal. Kristen 🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't freaking wait for this movie !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I care about is the single with Ariana grande... I could care less about the movie tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gay Kristen more beautiful and attractive
Charles Xavier in the movie 😁
Songs gonna be hard 😃"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm predicting one of the worst movies of the year....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are you here for the cringe too?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is there anything left to watch?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why so many dislikes omg

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am not into movies too much...
But I see many peoples hating on this movie saying that it's gonna be box office flop...It's gonna be very bad movie....
Can someone tell me why?....
I just saw the trailer bcoz of Powerful trio"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:32 of course she has a 3rd wave feminist haircut 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,You can already tell this will completly suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"came here for ruby rose but ends up its kirsten, so bye."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don’t get it they can’t just be spies they’re “lady spies” hate it when they exaggerate the feminism
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this feel like a CW show?
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMIII SCOTTT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony makes a movie that nobody has asked for. lol WTF this trailer trash. A remake of another remake that was trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Very soon we'll see Hollywood studios setting up Go fund me pages, cause the money they spend on making these movies going straight to the bin"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't waittt
RSUq4VfWfjE,WORST THING OF 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is soooo empowering that Chernobyl declared bankruptcy, they ran out of isotopes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Triumph logo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Charlie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is that a DC trailer? Bcz how they release the trailer. ""With the whole movie"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's a flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristan Stewart looks like shes enjoyed doing this role. Made me happy for her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love kristen 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,We need scarlett johansson in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart  would make a very handsome boy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Scarlett johansson fit in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like it’s trying way to hard to be Kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Holy mollyyy kristen stewart.u rock babe💓💓
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS LOOK AWESOME!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I only came here for the ""make me feel"" song by Janelle Monae.. now I'm kinda interested"
RSUq4VfWfjE,After twilight I’m surprised anyone hires kirsten Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,WoOohOoooo😄😄😄😄😄
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg! I can't wait. KRISTEN Stewart in this just made it 100 times better. 🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,flop in the making
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gila gila gilaaaa😲😭😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This isn't fair. Why can't Charlie's Angels be men?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ovear acting 
i don't like this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wanna watch this because of Bella Swan.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look at the dislikes!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“Don’t call me angel”

But...it’s...what?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Older ones look 12 times better in my own opinion.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Women are not strong and they certainly are not warrior material, this deranged fantasy of empowered women is cringe and pathetic."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just hope their characters aren't written as Mary sues. Please let them have some actual weaknesses rather than quirky traits to make them relatable!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a question if this movie bombs (any doubt?) Elizabeth will take the blame or not? If it's in the trailer she had done everything why not 3 Elizabeth clones as Charlie angels?😁😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart must be desperate for a pay check.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They  are not angel kristen even does not look like one so the title song is appropriate and plz can we mix batman her bf that would make nice angel vampire movie atleast a 100 plus opener
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't call me angel that's the song thn call me terminator as the lead actresses without too much expression looks like that it's a glossy remake without the heart of the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,whats the storyline. im so confused. im only going to listen to the song ariana is in.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm actually curious. I liked Kristen in American Ultra and am excited to see her in more action roles.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks shitty👌👌👌👌👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,Coming to a $5 Walmart movie bin near you soon.
RSUq4VfWfjE,it's a HARD pass for me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's sjw angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's stop making this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"great, more feminist girl power gaebage i won't watch."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So the Pink Ranger Kimberley and Rita Repulsar working together.... ooookkaayyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart out here fucking killing it
RSUq4VfWfjE,What absolute garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi and noah i love u
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for JASMINE! <3 not for KRISTEN. :p
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies Demons lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I couldn’t even tell who the
The actual 3 ANGELS were supposed to be. Other than Kristen ... I miss Cameron Drew and Lucy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angel : DONT CALL ME ANGEL
RSUq4VfWfjE,i love the new faces😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know... all the charm of angels is gone. Past angels were fervent, cheerful. Often pop up absurd and family situation. Very often there were references to the original with music, etc. New shows them as an action movie with elements of Comedy, but all the fervor and family somewhere evaporated... Alas, I do not see them as former angels... but according to the old will miss you"
RSUq4VfWfjE,charlies diversity & female empowerment
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is beautiful ❤️ I LOVE her
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok but what is juan carlos rivera doing here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They are beautiful. Action comedy.  I feel these actress enjoyed every moment they're shooting... 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My oldest sister watched Charlie's Angels movie with Cameron Diaz, Drew Berrymore and Lucy Liu."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Corny as hell.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I fukin love Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I compressed his carotids and deoxygenated his brainstem.""

Fancy jargon as it sounds, that's not possible. The carotid arteries don't go to the brainstem. The vertebrobasilar arteries at the back of the neck does."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, Sony would be going to the box office battle against Disney's Frozen in November by doing this Charlie's Angel remake.


I SEE. 😂😂
My wallet is getting numb. 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi: I'm Princess Jasmine.
Naomi: I'm Charlie's Angel.


ME: RELEASE THAT SONG! THEN CALL ME ANGEL!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m gonna be pissed if this movie ruins Naomi’s career Bc she an amazing actress and deserves better
RSUq4VfWfjE,I give it one week in theatres before they pull the plug.
RSUq4VfWfjE,angels are back
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I'm gonna say is.... WHY???
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Jasmine is her decoy and she's mad at Aladdin for lying as a prince.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:25 Bella Swan?...is that you?! Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I’m going to like this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll stick with Farrah, Tanya, Jaclyn, Cheryl, Kate and Shelley."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm more excited for the single tho ngl
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Jasmine?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf is Peter kavinsky doin here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy liu,dreww barrymore,cameran diaz.....The Charliez Angels😎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This just in, Bella Cullen is now working as a full time angel on Charlies Mansion. Meanwhile in Cullen Mansion, Edward and her daughter are in a shock and awe after watching his wife doing Black Widow thing in the tv."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:27 👌
And Kristen Stewart..... FABULOUS
 a funny bit by her: ‘Are you flirting with a handsome nerd?’"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I keep coming back to see the dislikes lmao

RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm excited to see itt!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's Charles Xavier doing in this movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks absolutely horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Use me as the original actors where better.
👇🏽"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want a Charlie's Angels with the Kingsmen  movie!!!😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:52 that was ripped right from kings-man
RSUq4VfWfjE,"After watched the Trailes (the whole movie)
if i have to choose to watch the OLD MOVIE  or this, 
il choose the OLD ONE, much better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cheap movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Reminds me of Kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Man movies are just getting worse and worse and worse. How are people still going to the movies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope nope nope. Not seeing this. It’s nothing compared to the one before this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I watching this for Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where can I get that background song
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow this is going to suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok let's just get right to the point. This remake is going to be garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hard pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok that went Wrong !
RSUq4VfWfjE,abella danger eh ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"And when this bellyflops at the theaters, they'll blame sexist bigots for it... and not the fact that it sucked alligator taint..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well this looks like utter trash !
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I know they wanna make things modern, but the charm and humor of the early 2000s can never be matched. That is what Drew Berrymore did better than anyone."
RSUq4VfWfjE,And another lame reboot that nobody asked for I almost fell asleep watching this piece of trash of a trailer . And by the way the whole so called badass female that's 98 pounds soaking wet beating up men that are over 6 foot 5 and 270 lb gimmick is lame nobody likes this .
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:53 i think its AUG(PUBG)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Big no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine and snow white 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many eyes rolled when Elizabeth Banks said she was Bosley?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trying hard.
Pls try harder.
Dont ruin my charlies angels great movie plsss. Wtf"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already love this movie 👍🏼💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,The cast is weak! They look like kids!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels😍😍😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""dont call me angel"".... ok, ""the charlies bullshits"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kinda wish they just used Destiny Child’s Independent Woman track- hope the only reason they didn’t was because it was to expensive 

(But if they can afford Ariana Grande Beyoncé shouldn’t be too too far off)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies angel is Karen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why are we rebooting all these ""reboots""? Hollywood is truly out of ideas"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not upto the mark.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"KEEP THE MOVIE, GIVE US THE SONGS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Everyone:  can we please be given some original stories 

Sony:  here comes the unwanted Charlie’s angles reboot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sponsored by Audi.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now we know that there is a princess Jasmin and Snow white in one movie😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we fucking not
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh great, another all-female remake...
Wait."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i was expecting kristen to look bad, but im pleasantly surprised. the  charlie's angels mantle becomes her."
RSUq4VfWfjE,i heared the voice of ariana grande
RSUq4VfWfjE,And I thought crappy movies were made in Indian film industry only (with exceptions). Welcome to the club Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a steaming pile of crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original is still better in every way
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks stupid lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like absolute shite.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Kristen Kristen 😍❤️😍❤️😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"so let's call the movie just ""Charlies"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another trash movie from Sony!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can't tell if this is cringey in a cool way, or cool in a cringey way"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie looks lit but the iconic sound is missing
RSUq4VfWfjE,That Tavor-21 though
RSUq4VfWfjE,"CA should consist a white, a black and an asian."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Actually so excited to see this ☺️♥️💗💕😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Prefer the 70s angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is really a vampire now.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great another ridiculously unfeasible girl power movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,First time I see Kristen S show so much emotion in a movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The fight scenes in the first 30 seconds are fucking terrible. Like, No!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original movies were fun because it didn't take itself too seriously. Why didn't they just have a different title entirely?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart really??? They could have anybody but they chose her damn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"nobody:
literally nobody:
Hollywood: Okay fine we'll reboot Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y isn't there any aisan to play Lucy lui???  Sad... Was wating for Charlie's angle....
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer soooo makes me NOT to watch this movie !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The beauty shots better be on point
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Other two girls are hot, replace Kristen Stewart lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,THEY GOT RID OF THE MARTIAL ARTS MASTER ASIAN CHICK. THIS MOVIE WILL BE TERRIBLE. I DON'T SEE IT GOING ANYWHERE FAR IN THE BOX OFFICE.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oceans 4?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to lose some money.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF IS THIS MOVIE? I'LL PASS.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like: Charlie's Diversity...not going to see this drivel
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw this trailer bcz of twilight girl 😘😘 I love you twilight girl 💓💓💓💓
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So this looks like the female answer to Kingsman, and I do not mean that in a bad way."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's my Asian girl?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The remake looks nice and interesting to watch
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hello Eleen?!!!

RSUq4VfWfjE,La pezuñenta
RSUq4VfWfjE,check out my cover of EARFQUAKE if ya want :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nyanyi anak anak
RSUq4VfWfjE,still waiting for zords to be featured in the trailers
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Bella? I mean Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss the old ones
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella swan and jasmine in action. Wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,They worry about making movies more politically correct than entertaining these days 😭🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You look at a movie trailer, who do you see.........NOAH FREAKING CENTINEO, he's like in literally every movie🙌"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Congratulations you just destroy the franchise with just one single trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Needs more ‘camp’
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What a massive investment of time, talent, production and money; how can it be so obviously bad? how do they get all the way to the youtube comments section before anyone clues them in to the total failure and waste that this is? It's truly mind boggling that no one could see it, say it and do something about it..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine has leaved Agrabah and joined a whole new world
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there a black woman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,More rehash trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,They just should’ve made the new angels men and made Charlie Charlotte it would’ve been something different. Plus I think everyone would love to see how this would’ve worked with three male  detectives working for a female billionaire they’ve never meet.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just become so gay with short haired gurls 😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott is so talented....she can act, sing, and fight....i love her"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohh its naomi scott.....the girl in alladin
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm sorry but Cameron, Lucy and Drew are MY angels. 😄😄😊."
RSUq4VfWfjE,😑 P.C. movies are ruining Hollywood!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lost the old flavor
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else here wants to slay a short short hair? 😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really odd that this wasn't gender-swapped like every single other 2010's reboot. Strange.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should've gotten Crispin Glover to reprise his role as Creepy Thin Man, he was the best part of the old ones."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is everywhere because she's Bosley and Bosley's like... everywhere.
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like a shitty CW series.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kool with remake. Just dont make one gay. We know you are out there. Dont need it in our face everywhere.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is how a real woman empowerment movie should be like. Not just some 2 hours long propoganda against men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too many white chicks in this too its not LGBTQUZ enough
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this straight to Amazon Prime?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A indústria cinematográfica tá socando o Noah Centineo em todo filme, puta q pariu"
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh. Charlie's angels 90210
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will watch it because Naomi Scott is in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love cringing on this
RSUq4VfWfjE,The girls are lesbian ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,😴😴😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana 😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1, I'm kinda hoping we didn't just see Charlie already...
2, While I liked the more light hearted version, this looks interesting, and 
3, ...... I want Tostinos for some reason."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1st chucky, then fast and furious, now this...my childhood is ruined"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is everyone pretending like the original was a masterpiece????  I personally really enjoyed it, but It was super badly rated on its time lmao. I feel like this a fresh take and making it to the standards of the society we live in today. I'm gonna watch it for sure, the acting looks like its gonna be top notch and i hope the movie doesnt take itself to seriously. its a comedy after all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have a feeling this is going to suck sooooo bad. Just a feeling. Redoing classics has not worked for some time, what is wrong with you SONY."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another got woke, go broke, pc “movie”. No thank you."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They can't beat old Angeles
RSUq4VfWfjE,First ten seconds of the trailer and I can tell already this is going to be a box office bomb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is really running out of ideas
RSUq4VfWfjE,If it werent for kristen stewarts first stupid line the dislikes on this would be much much less
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes Kristen Stewart yaaaas
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You: Naomi Scott from Charlie’s Angels & Aladdin

Me: “Mo” from *Lemonade Mouth*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not excited for this movie they whould just leave it alone
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism ruins everything💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t know how I feel about this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: The original Charle's Angels 2003 is much better than this.
Me again: Oh maybe i should watch this first. 😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seems dope but honestly, why Kirsten Stewart?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wouldn't it be easier to call them ""Elizabeth's Angels"" ?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"a better cast would have made a more relevant film, this is generic 2019 in all its splendor"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart made me want to see this film.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You’re not a waitress
No, I’m LIKE BUTTON"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s Pitch Perfect meets Mission impossible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,I actually would like to see this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They need cast better angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like total sh;t going go watch cameron, drew, and lucy kill it in the real Charlie's angels movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,فين رح ينعرض
RSUq4VfWfjE,another show to throw men under the bus
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a feeling Elizabeth Banks was somehow involved. Just a guess tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m sorry but this is a no from me. This remake looks bad and cringy. Cool song tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,Realy bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn
RSUq4VfWfjE,People trip to much about the damn trailer. Let the damn movie come out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll pass on Charlie's Angels, the ones from 20 years ago sucked and this one looks even worse."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I found this movie very hard to believe and even imagine, but i believe superman exist"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol the bad guy at the start was right. They really shouldn't have made this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another reboot of this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm Elizabeth Williams and you're watching Disney Channel
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reminds me of the 2016 ghostbusters.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is this? A teenie tv show?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yea! Girl power y'all! 100lb, female, badasses are always hilarious!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pubg fans notice AUG A3??😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,who asked for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,From pink power ranger to princess jasmine to a charlie's angel. Naomi Scott's gaining huge. 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"But the real question is, will this movie live up to the first one?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I still hadn't seen the last version with Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Keep the old actresses wtf they're not even old no ones gonna be into this lol stupid af
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks trashy. The 2000's version did at least not take itself seriously. Here, the actors actually think they are all that."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boner killers, bad acting and more lesbian romance that kills the entire franchise.. this is the 2016 ghostbusters of the charlies angel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So nobody gonna talk about Belle?
RSUq4VfWfjE,ugh no one wants to see charlie's angel. except charlie. that pervert bastard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's connect to the music video of bad blood by Taylor swift.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do I have the feeling Professor X is actually the bad guy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m so gay jesus
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great another Naomi Scott movie
Guns aren't for her but the other one 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Kristen Stewart she always looks dead and emotionless. They don’t even have the same names. Sorry not sorry.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously Kristen 🤦🏾‍♀️ all of Hollywood’s gems and someone said “I know who we can get” smhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:04 noah centino
RSUq4VfWfjE,the cringe is stronge on this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss my girls Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz. 😭 Take me back to my childhood please! They should at least have these three do a cameo or something."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just realized that Peter Kavinsky was there 🤣🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m excited to watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks soooo bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't ever come up with something new..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummmmmmmm...ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love this trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Prediction;  (((Fail)))
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is a trio of feminist lesbians doing nonsense stuff 
Totally a failure"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks exists because traditional anything can't keep up.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want these pretty Angels

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love the 80 lb girls using their heads and arms to bash men with armor. I mean, cmon, use your heads. You realize they would be bruised and damaged beyond belief? lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie should be unknown to their girls. this movies already trash... smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,didn't like it! the cast don't match with eachother
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, IDK about the movie itself...the trailer sucked though, lol."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are they hoping this generation doesn't remember the last reboots?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is the only person involved with the making of this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Badass. Especially this Jane chick.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh look at that.
More garbage...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"honestly this looks fine. I see quite a few secret agent plot holes, but this looks like a fun film"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y’all ready for the golden girls reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WOOOOOW, this looks baaaad.   Is this in the same universe as the Jem and the Holograms movie?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood, stop making these lazy garbage reboots."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not the actions and beauties like cameron, drew, lucy...miss u darlings....there should only be 3 of them.💜"

RSUq4VfWfjE,i thought she said a trailer. but i just saw the whole movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"One has to question the feminist storyline, when in fact, the women are still performing for THE MAN. It's so evident that Elizabeth Banks is going to be the real Charlie....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn't think people were so attached to the early 00's Charlie's Angels but I guess I was wrong. By the looks of this trailer the movie might be fun. I like the vibes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did it feel like a fan made trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Perfect casting
RSUq4VfWfjE,am I the only one that's really excited for it 🤭
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie will make 7 dollars.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If this movie is Jack shite I’m gonna be very pissed off, because they would have ruined one of my favourite movies. Lucy, Cameron and Drew are always going to be the best Charlie’s angels. 🤨😤"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the Asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg jasmine is in this omg.

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Maybe if Hollywood stopped virtue signalling everyone all the time , they might actually have the time to come up with something original"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Us : Ok Hollywood , enough reboots, prequels , sequels ,etc.
Hollywood : (in DJ Khaled voice) and another one"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Interesting how they didn't just put neomi scott to be the British actor since she is actually British lol but then I don't know who the other chick is so she might be British to lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn Hollywood refuses to come up with anything new and innovative. Recycle Wash Rinse and Repeat. Sad
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤕🤔🤦
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm old enough to have watched the original TV series back in the day. I loved the show. I enjoyed the movie versions several years ago too. This looks decent. The key to Charlie's Angels is to add some humor and not let things get too serious. I like that they seem to be keeping that in this movie as well. I also love Elizabeth Banks. She's got great comedic timing in movies where she's playing that side. I'll go see this. It just looks like fun. And I think it helps that they are keeping it a little silly and not too intense. I like that they are giving Kristen Stewart a different type of role to play. She's grown a lot as an actress since her Twilight days.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Come on Hollywood this is horrible dam everything they do now is bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Scarlett Johnson Gal Gadot and Michelle Rodriguez the Ideal cast of Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why no nude scene is in the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks:I can act, direct, write a script & produce a movie

Carson Clay:Hold my beer🍺🍺"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, but this looks insufferable and boring. I'd rather watch the Cameron Diaz one. I don't like these actresses so there's nothing left to like but the plot but it's been done already."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Still looks interesting, kinda.  BUT, I do really wish they took a bit more of a serious route, and make it R-rated.  That would really separate it from the Lucy Liu, Drew, and Cameron ones, and possibly bring it more towards the original TV series (somewhere in between, but a little more on the serious).  Let's hope the ""gung-fu"" action sequences are more akin to a Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Tony Jaa seriousness level, but I can already tell it'll have those silly one-liner jokes kinda like the other two movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 the year of sequels
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 the year of sequels
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like Kristen Stewart style... A different style wow...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart ❤ i love You 🌍🇧🇷❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously?
It's Kristen Stewart?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,kids movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood ---> ""How can we make lots of money without spending any ?""
Hollywood ---> ""Let's just keep remaking the same movies over and over."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I predict that this movie will either be awful or extremely awful!! p.s. The Black girl is so hot she would make me donate Blood to a Crip!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A female Bosley? Why not make Charlie's Angels with an all-male cast? 

A female Bosley and an all-male Charlie's Angels seems more progressive than this. They could've been even more woke. Hollywood's failed opportunity to signal their superior virtues."
RSUq4VfWfjE,nope. previous angels were too hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Professor X- “The X men is over, i need to create new group” 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is a Charlie Angel? Who casted this ? The casting of director of Twilight ? I have no issues with the rest of the cast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope the best angels is in the 70s  TV show
RSUq4VfWfjE,"dont put the twilight girl in an action movie, lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, look. A movie about a regular youngster discovering about the existence of an international agency that battles evil and joins them to save the world. I've never seen that before. (P.s. Is it just me or Naomi Scott looks like Abella Danger?)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart should play in traffic on I-69 during rush hour with a blindfold on...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would NEVER pay $20 to see this crap....unless they are licking each other's juice box.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This won't beat the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this looks so freaking G.....AY
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,What? No gender swap this time?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi's character is so cringy!!! Gawd
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. Elizabeth Banks so gorgeous 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart bleh. Changed bosley to a female of course you did. Surprised Charlie is still a dude. And weapon guy is gay.... well you hit all of the sjw bullet points and I will laugh at your box office numbers. You can't just use the best people for the part right? Always have to push an agenda.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Bosley is now a chick? So woke....
RSUq4VfWfjE,This got me wishing they’d done a full trilogy with the Diaz-Liu-Barrymore line-up.
RSUq4VfWfjE,At first I thought Kristen Stewart was Teresa Palmer 😳
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder why they didn’t keep Bosley’s character male?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,More proof Hollywood had no new ideas.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original trio are the only Charlie's angels and why the hell would you cast Kristen Stuart 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really? There is no creativity in Hollywood. Another boring remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Action scenes extremely slow. Otherwise still not so better than its previous version.
RSUq4VfWfjE,😀😍😍😍👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,It smells of the Ultra Feminist reboot that is badass but I have an unhealthy curiosity Aaaaaaaaaaaaaark Bella Swan ... The least sexy woman and with the least facial expression of the cinema        Fucking Gender Swap !!! Bring Me LucyLiu Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,so ariana grande did the sining or what? i am so confused. is she acting?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I shdnt compare but not D, L C class!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shame on you Patrick Stewart for appearing in this trash movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,TRASH
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Totaly Spies deserved their movie! How long can wait.  If they couldn't make season 7, at least we'd see a movie about Alex, Sam and Сlover."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else find kristen Stewart's acting so cringy in this? Waiting for her to start acting..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jelek
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't know why but it bothers me so much that one of them is too tall. lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a trailer for something that isn't Charlie's Angels. I wonder why they didn't just go with a different name.
RSUq4VfWfjE,mas maganda pa din yung dating charlies angel..original is the best lalo na c cammeron
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thank you Hollywood for making books great again !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cuz the 2000 Charlies Angels wasnt empowering women enough for 2019, they had to go and change Bosley to a women. I'm willing to bet the twist in this movie is Charlies is actually a women as well.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The girls look like they have solid chemistry with each other but the music absolutely ruins this trailer. The entire thing feels more like an ad for the Ariana Grande cover of the theme than the actual movie. It's insanely distracting and is doing this no favors.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excited 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,How to bring the best out of Kristen Stewart: surround her with women
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The fact that its Kristen Stewart ,let’s me know how terrible this is going to be."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They keep ruining old movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope the old angels make a cameo. 
Alex Munday was my favorite."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hit like if you are here for Jonathan Tucker!
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one:
Absolutely no one:
Elizabeth Banks: Me"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would pay money not to see that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,can't wait for the Charlie's Angels trans version.... with trans director... and trans soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,She could star in nice slut roles but she chose to spam movie credits.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only reasons why I'm interested:
1) love Charlie's angels 
2) have a crush on Kristen Stewart
3) crush on Elizabeth banks"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not going to lie... The trailer is kinda cringy...

Not that many action scenes (strange for a spy movie) and the acting seems kinda... errr...

Guy: *Slaps mints out her hand*
Also guy: Don’t things! Some of these things explode 🙃"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,So cool 😃😍😍. I totally love it❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,We have to wait and see if feminist can make this movie hit or not.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super movie in thought
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks like Ellen 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don’t judge a girl by her cover... Open it and see....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The Message is Clear.. 😊

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. 😎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,since the trailer to be release I have been watching it more than 50 times. I like the power of women 😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi is so cute
RSUq4VfWfjE,HORRIBLE trailer. i hope the movie's better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love Charlies Angels soo much!! I love the 70s tv show and the 2000s movies!!!



Thats why I won't be seeing this grabage......"
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is professor X here? 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks kinda feministic. Everybody hates feminism.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,YUSSSSSSSSSS THIS IS MY CHILDHOOD 💖💖💖💖🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥💋💋💋💋
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why would Captain Picard do this movie? 🙄😡
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So many remakes in Hollywood , they are definitely running out of ideas"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ill give it a chance it looks ok!👌🏽
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So sexist, where is the men’s Charlie’s Angels?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,We better see the old angels and Bosley
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They've seriously turned ""Bosley"" into a woman. That's infuriating 🙄😡"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Emma look like twins...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boss
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only for sweeeetert
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are so many people shitting on a movie which is obviously made for pre-teen girls?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They're so pretty
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like the casting and it seems fun, but whoever edited the trailer did not do it any favors. It was all over the place."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood fluff. Boring.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't call me angel?? O.o
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel nothing for this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,i just miss the old one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this looks dumb
RSUq4VfWfjE,For some reason I feel like I know the whole story
RSUq4VfWfjE,BLAND!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Some of these blow up""
*immediately slaps them out of her hand*
Seems legit"
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know i feel like movies like this i got to be a girl to be hyped up for but then again i dont get hyped up for a fast an furious movie so maybe its just bad :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The real movie name is : Fast & Furious  girls edition "".... 🤔"

By the way, where is the love concept?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The name of The first song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Women can do things? Wow I had no idea, thank you Elizabeth Banks, so insightful......"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Virtual vomit
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn! I miss the original angels even more now.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female KingsMen but more American
RSUq4VfWfjE,The pacing in this trailer is SO weird
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart character is kinda similar to Lucy Liu in 2000 movie,
and Naomi Scott is to Drew Barrymore
and Ella is to Cameron Diaz!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart was fantastic and beautiful actress
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where going to need.....WIGS, TOYS......CLOTHES.......BETTER ACTORS........BETTER SCRIPT     ETC"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Shocking, Hollywood is putting out another remake. Has everybody in that town just become lazy?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott and Kristen Stewart. Agghhhhhhhh ah
RSUq4VfWfjE,Script looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,missing cameron diaz huhuhu
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm happy for Kristen and Naomi but i just got bored in these 2 mins itself...

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen is looking great... This version seems way better than the last ones, which was just women looking hot"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"trailer producer: how much of the movie do you want in the trailer?


hollywood: yes 😂😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that biebs? 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nah not feeling this one sorry,they just don’t make films like they used to anymore apart from the things the MCU franchise is doing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw this movie when I was a kid ..back then..the actresses appeared to be lil.different..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They're making another Charlie's Angles movie?

*Why Tho?*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so cringed...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yikes. This will flop, massively. This looks really bad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,don't call me angle ok i'll call you demon

RSUq4VfWfjE,not impressed
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh no one cares
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen looks hot with blonde wig 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo acts like one character in all the movies he’s in. (Himself)
RSUq4VfWfjE,John wick could did that all alone
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Calling it now, this movies getting a 6.2/10 IMDB"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Again. Ugh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony,when first trailer BAD BOYS for LIF3?"

RSUq4VfWfjE,You're on thin ice now Sony.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn. They made Fairy Odd Parents all over again. This was made from the fairyoddparentshaterclib
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande turned me off

RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is here because of our Princess Jasmine?
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this looks similar to Ghostbusters?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I think women can do anything.""
""Just because they can, doesn't mean they should.""

Are you kidding me? This is the fastest I have ever lost interest in a movie.

Who the f*ck wrote this script? A woman?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,She's done with twilight bitches 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,STOKED!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The chemistry between Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu is just unquestionable, I can't say the same for the new Charlie's Angels 2019 🤮...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thakn you for showing all the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Um they said ""bad guy"" instead of bad person. All men are bad? This movie is sexist against men"
RSUq4VfWfjE,With Elizabeth Banks...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look way better and more entertaining than 2003’s and 2000’s version. What’s up with all haters?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Theme music did not even get a modern style remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't call me Angel""...
Me: It's the MOVIE NAME😶😐"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,This should have more dislikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna flop so bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,She looks bad as a blonde
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought Patrick Stewart was playing Charlie, but I guess he's done playing ""the guy in the chair"" roles (would have shared a name too) 😆"
RSUq4VfWfjE,NONE of them is looks like Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Huh? This does has promise. Hopefully it does decent.

P.S. I don't know much about Charlie's Angels. All I know that it was a TV show (or movie)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy Lu, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz FOREVER!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't help but to miss cameron diaz.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood is only interested in gender swaps when it empowers women. 

Also, Kristen Stewart looks so out of place in this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bring it back ,,,old version 👎👎👎👎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sexy  & hot movie!

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen should gether sex reassigned, that birch looks more and more like a man each day, it's OK to be Trans or lesbian but she is obviously a dude trapped in a female body."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This gives me more of a Totally Spies vibe than Charlie’s Angels vibe...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is the hair cut for woman getting shorter and shorter, 99% of the time that looks fucking awful just like in this trailer. 
What's wrong with long beautiful hair???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Burn it to the ground
RSUq4VfWfjE,i dont remember a black angel 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why the f_ck is Bosley a woman!? at this rate, Charlie will be a woman in the sequel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"BLACK ANGEL entered the room
ASAIN ANGEL left the room.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I do hope they use the Charlie's Angels theme song in the actual movie. It's only been my ringtone for 19 years.

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looking forward p terminator 20, predator 50. bad boys 11 and charlies angel 60"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyone be throwing shade while I be wondering where I get those sunglasses
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shite.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it Noah Centineo? Why aren't you guys talking about him? 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash 🗑 no thank you 🙏
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ooo oww ooh, Charlie bit my finger"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤦🤦🤦
RSUq4VfWfjE,i'm way too gay not to watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont think this movie will do great
RSUq4VfWfjE,k
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Bonnie Mckee - Bombastic i hear? lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels don’t use guns
RSUq4VfWfjE,No Asian Girl?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice to see the weird hair guy is still in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood feminism propaganda again.. Americans should welcome Oprah as your future president.. Hehehehe
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will be just like MIB and Godzilla
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girls girls girls
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood still can’t think of new ideas I see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,finally heard Lana’s voice
RSUq4VfWfjE,lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is there deleted scenes with these girls covered in jizz?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody absolutely nobody can ever replace Cameron Diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow another remake NO ONE asked for
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks thank you thank you so much.   Awesome and much  needed, Producer and Bosley you rock, of course you could be an Angel too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw patrick stewart i thought it he was charlie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kirsten Stewart's character is obviously meant to be a LGBTQ+ character. And the other other two could be presumed by association to be on the non-straight spectrum, at a minimum. Sony and the actresses will claim that it is up to the audience to decide. And they will. Most will see this team as a grouping of gay/bisexual women with at least one of them being non-binary."
RSUq4VfWfjE,These laydeees are so strong and brave!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yess
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be the most cringe fest movie this year. Jesus No One asked for a remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They are angels ! In whose sight...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girls are more sluttier in this i like it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ghostbusters rewritten as women, charlie's angels going through a 3rd incarnation....  Maybe Rambo can get redone as a female protagonist?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am inlove
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll catch this when they play it on FX or TNT.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Already a reboot? Last one was mediocre, but Cameron, Lucy and Drew were better actress by a mile. Hope I'm wrong, guess I'll see."
RSUq4VfWfjE,No sexy scene..😓
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well done, this is officially the worst trailer I've seen in recent memory. Horribly edited, horrible pacing and just fucking confusing, assuming the audience knows many things already, which indicates this will be a horrible movie. Thanks for the warning in advance. And also for absolutely nothing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart gave so many expressions in the first 30 secs of the trailer , than what she has given in her entire career.. 🙄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart? I'm in!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Clicked on this now I wanna take my click back 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm happy I can release all my gayness for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hmmm what with all the progressive remakes I felt this should have had for of a male cast influence, I mean cmon we know girls can be amazing action stars but give the guys a chance"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yo, everyone’s complaining about this, but I’ve never been interested in Charlie’s Angels until now, so I’m going to watch it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess jasmine turned into a spy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one asked for this. We're fine with the original masterpiece, thank you very much."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kimberly, Rita Repulsa, Zordon"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i’m only going to watch this because lana is on the track
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this movie using a tv budget?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn Bosley is a girl now and becomes like kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pride in ones gender disgusts me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sooo Kristen Stewart is hot now...  Didn't see that coming
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤜✊✊✊💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don’t judge a girl by her cover."" - Can I at least judge a shitty movie by it's crappy Trailer?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A handsome nerd...ok what..•
RSUq4VfWfjE,minge cringe movies are all the rage just now.. just let them have their fun trying to act like men. 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,JASMINE!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this is so unique, you could rename the movie ""hangover 4"" and it would make sense"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks solid.  I can't believe people are being triggered by this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Executive: ""So what should we put in the trailer?""

Gary Oldman: ""EVERYTHING!!!!!1!!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think these girls are real world power purf girls (did i write purf right or wrong?)
RSUq4VfWfjE,everyone knows this will flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If you check the 2000 and 2000 Charlies angels trailer, that have more action scenes and dope action scenes and great chemistry and this one just lacks everybit of it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Man I forgot how gay I am for Kristan Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's the need for spies when professor Xavier's is here
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can't believe they're doing another remake of Charlie's Angels. This looks ridiculous and an entire waste of money and effort for not a ""B"" movie but a ""zzzzzz"" movie. 
It will be a flop just like the other one. You can't top the original t.v. series back in the 70's and to try to is pathetic. This is a joke. Whatever happened to making films with substance and meaning? Thank goodness for TCM and the classics as well as a barrage of legitimate acting talent and great original storylines."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh great another reboot. 💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As much as I like Naomi Scott, I like the "" original "" original charlies angels, y'know from the 70s"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ll watch it for Patrick Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"6 million views and apparently its 2.95million members of the He-Man Women Hater's Club and 2.95 million people that think Drew, Cameron, and Lucy are the original Charlie's Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just because you could make this film you shouldn't have! These are the worst girls for Angels. Won't even make 30 million
RSUq4VfWfjE,Longest Audi ad ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kirsten-Drew's Role
Ella-Alex's Role
Naomi-Cameron's Role. 

Right? 😘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is no tat gud
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waaaaao...I love this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is the most normal I've seen Kristen Stewart look... ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will watch this movie only for elizabeth banks nd elizabeth banks and also for elizabeth banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart is soo hott 🔥❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did you know Elizabeth banks is involved?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A. Old Charlie angels was not a class act so whats the need to reboot.
B. Shows bankruptcy of ideas and script. 
C. Trailer sucks..BIG TIME"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's Abu?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"you know a move will be bad, if you can't even watch the whole movie...


or should i say


another reboot noone ever asked for?
it's a a remake to a reboot to 70s show and barely anyone remembers that...
jeez the 2000er version of this show alsow as bad... but at least somewhat entertaining... this is just... plain dumb


sony pls stop making movies, make another playstation, and maybe another final fantasy but stop making movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart? Hard pass! She is straight up gross, and couldn't act her way out of a wet paper sack."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn they couldn’t find another beautiful black, young Naomi Cambel for this movie? Do we really need another light skin actress to complete the “diversity” quota?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Would love to see the movie💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Even though people are saying that this movie will be bad, I’m still gonna watch it. Guess I’m the only one left though..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please don't make it a disaster as Ghostbusters remake.., 🙏"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is she twilight girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like the worst thing ever!
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the hell Kristen Stewart can act. And not a melee make you want to slap her like she maybe people want to hit her in the Twilight movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m excited for it ☺️
RSUq4VfWfjE,when you hear your queen Ariana Grande 🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this have so many dislikes?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like a Disney movie ... boring . 

I miss drew, cam and Lucy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,When you don't want to pay your producing team and decide to do it all by yourself.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damnnn i really wanna see this movie and fangirling over those hot women! they are so badass and kristen stewarts hair is so cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott 🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,They are no angels... they are just demons.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 💗🤞
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That looks awesome, I am hyped! Didn't even know this was in the making tbh but its in my diary now"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott - perfect combo - Indian Mother + British Father
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stewart😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,hollywood ran out of ideas i see lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no they brought professor xavier in to this didn’t they. 🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one is going to watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood why are you rebooting rubbish. Come up with some new ideas for god's sake. Are all your writers and producers  that useless they can't even come up with a new idea.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Soooo Ella Balinska is goin to be a Disney Princess now, huh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Producers: how can we make a movie already about three badass women with infinite talents MORE feminist?
Writers: let's make the only traditionally male on-screen character a woman AND the person they're protecting a STEM focused individual changing industry....

FML......"
RSUq4VfWfjE,HELLS YEAH!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss the time when Angels don't use guns. Well most of the people would agree that Dylan, Natalie and Alex are the best Angels and McG is the best director for Charlie's Angels franchise. Fight me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,no thrills ..non interesting promo...Cheapest version of Charles angels...!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait more
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, I'm gonna fail this November too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,yuck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see Noah❤😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,what? they made another twilight movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok compared to most movies that have females leading roles in action this one actually looks decent imo.
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,🎬🎥⚙⌚️🎬✨👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼✊💪💥💥💥👍👍👍💧✊🤓😘😍😀😀😀🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,From princess jasmine to one of the angels real quick
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a promo for Ari-Lana-Miley collab. A bad one at that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm not saying this movie is gonna be amazing but why is everyone in the comment section making it seem that the 2000's Charlie's Angels is a movie worth watching?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No more Asian for this franchine, why?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great! Yay! Another movie about feminism! Wonderful; I can't wait. One question, though. Why are women not allowed to play villains in films these days? I mean, it is 2019 and it should be okay for female actors to perform as the opposition, right? Why are there no female villains in this movie? Why is this movie so sexist? :(   _fart_"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg this is so sexist why couldn’t there be at least one guy one this team omg ruin it and make it a male cast for the main characters 😤
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awesome trailer .... My fab is here...# Kristen Stewart..# Bella...I will definitely watch this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,this could've been fine if elizabeth banks hadn't put her grubby mitts all over it
RSUq4VfWfjE,😱 nooooo!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Bosley not TRANS!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that princess jasmine??
RSUq4VfWfjE,(Most of the) Story inspired by Kingsmen: the Secret service. Directed by Mathew Vaughn.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Women can do anything""

Spend the entirety of the movie exploiting their sexuality to get ahead."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thank you Sony Pictures Entertainment  for showing me the whole movie in this 2 minutes and 53 seconds video trailer!
RSUq4VfWfjE,femimazi woke version. nope. when men are just generic clown villains😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Noah centineo freakin everywhere!!???!
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should launch this trailor on t-series for more views.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't call me angel"" - Okay, I'll call this Charlie's Wamen."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh am I the only one that got annoyed when I saw Noah Centineo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie Swan is proud of Bella Swan for finally moving out of town.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nooe
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In case you didn't notice by the several pop ups, MILEY CYRUS ARIANNA GRANDE LANA DEL RAY

YOUR WELCOME!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can see them call everyone sexist pig after this movie flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMIIII
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hay kristen stewart your superb ya
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,We want Tami dubbed version
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like Bella got tired of Edward's controlling attitude & Jacob's temper & immaturity & decided to become a spy & not just any spy also the wardrobes would make Alice green with jealousy. We get to see Princesses Snow White & Jasmine team up along with Professor Xavier who has been keeping secrets from the X-Men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When you realized that professor x can finally walk 😌😌😌
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They should have casted Sandra Oh, Margot Robbie and Heidi Klum instead..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why isn’t there an Asian lead? Nothing against these actresses but it seems like a prime opportunity to have a diverse case that fell flat.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who has disliked this trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ulan ne karılar var be
RSUq4VfWfjE,These ladies looking awesome. So excited for Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just a load of CR**, another remake of SJW nonsence"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish Bernie Mac was still alive :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,When did Justin Bieber started doing cinemas
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn so Hollywood running out of ideas,  is an actual fact. 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i think it woulda been better if they ACTUALLY casted Miley Cyrus , Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey s Charlie's Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didn't know Abella Danger had made it to Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I honestly can’t express how mad I am about this. First of all, stop trying to replace Cameron Diaz. And secondly, the only time I did t want to punch Kristen Stewart in the face was when she basically came out on SNL. I’m honestly offended they would replace Cameron with her.  I FUCKING can’t."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trying too hard?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart: *I'm Charlie's Angel*

Robert: *I'm Batman*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,who's here just to listen the song !? and who is listening to the song just to hear Lana Del Rey's voice !?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Definitely want to watch this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,shitty
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who even knows what the heck is going on?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another hollywood cash grab ""why dont we use twilights bella to replace Cameron diaz"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elisabeth Banks, the only actress not afraid to show her narcissism. I mean. How many movies did she direct, produce and at the same time be cast on it too? I can imagine her seating in the audition room and thinking she's the only person on the job.


Nevertheless, great to see Prof. X walking again."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Production like a TV Series.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The old Charlie's Angels was cool but this one looks way better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am more excited about the song than the movie tbh 😆😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,cheesy :P
RSUq4VfWfjE,THE SONG IS SLAYING
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mmm?
Nah."
RSUq4VfWfjE,.....why....is noah...centepide....there....
RSUq4VfWfjE,FEATERING A NEW SINGLE BY MILER CYRUS
RSUq4VfWfjE,This better not be a statement movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soy la unica que miro el trailer por luis gerardo mendez? 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This plot sounds like every other action movie ever
“Oh no bad guy trying to take my tech make weapon that go boom”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The sexist sjw movies and series, usually have bad scripts/casting/..., hope this one is not that bad. I actually liked the old angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is lit!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bc nov k movie or tailer abhi ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen stewart used to look so pretty in her twilight days. But the way she's turned out now, she has completely lost all that sheen and limelight and now no one even wants to see her in any movie. Completely lost it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,am i the only one who's hypin more about Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is this Disney Princess angels this is totally 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🆗
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bomb detected!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me or are remakes the only thing coming out of Hollywood these days??? That and Superheroes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You almost had me, but then it got _too_ girly -and you lost me.
Sincerely, 


-Men."
RSUq4VfWfjE,A movie called charlies angels with a song called dont call me angel...wtaf???🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems like I saw the whole movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie looks sad af not seeing it unless Batman is real lol not
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*I think it's just me but I think, Elizabeth Banks is involved somehow.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"HORRIBLE....I love Charlies Angels but I can't even sit through this trailer much less the movie.  Original 1976 trio was the best and the movies with Drew Barrymore were a lot of fun ,  but they dropped the ball with this new concept.  Wrong choices for Angels and Elizabeth as Bosley?  Um....NO"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh so Charles Xavier can walk now, huh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's almost 10 years gone but nothing better ... no feeling in conversation, no real about relationship with 3 girl + boss Lee Then no my angel too"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,This ll suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Its Sam, Alex and Clover by the way"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elite programmers don't refer to themselves as elite programmers. I love Elizabeth Banks, but this is just lazy writing. Everything about it screams lazy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist SJW sh*t. Hope they will lose a lot of Money with this one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watched the original charlies angels series (the super old one) and the the two Charlie's angels movies. Tried to watch the new series but it just wasn't the same. I hope at least this one will be decent and just not make me want to rewatch the og series and og movies. I also hope they respect the rules
RSUq4VfWfjE,I uploaded kabir singh head to my channel to watch
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bati man..😅😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Badass kristen is back😇😈👊
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder nobody is talking about Noah Centineo In this film
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yaaaay!! Can't wait 😍👏🏼
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see Noah. Imma watch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie with female actors that's going to suck just like the Ghostbusters remake did pathetic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess jasmine?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The cast should've been ; Kristen Stewart, Megan Fox, gal gadot or Dakota Johnson.
OR
Scarlet Johnson, Mila kunis, Margot Robbie 
BAAM"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really hope this does well so y’all can stfu 🙄🤦🏾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop the remakes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fan made movie ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Let me guess , they are all lesbians"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Luis Gerardo Méndez 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s gonna take one hell of a plot twist to make this movie bearable
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People are hating on this bc of the last movie version is ""the best"" you all realise there was a show based on this before that movie but everyone was perfectly fine back then and loved it but now they want to remake it for a 3rd time and the people are just not having it sis??? Y'all are crazy!!!!  Lol don't be hating on one of the most iconic franchises in hurrrstory darlings. Don't make me call up the an I'll make a hit y'all xD"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really? I just want to listen the fucking song now! :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another feminist movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,really? this is a remake now im starting to think hollywood cant think of anything orginal nowadays
RSUq4VfWfjE,Growing  up orginal  CHARLIE'S ANGELS was the bomb on Saturday nights! Remake 2nd  movie version  with  Bernie  Mac as Bosley half brother. Now this with a female  Bosley come on get it right. No thank you watch the orginal  on MeTV! Ill bet you there's  a agenda  behind this insane  madness.  I sure don't  like that symbol of broken  triangle. Dont look like wings to me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh! Yeah-pi -kay lady's kills  more
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like for Naomi
RSUq4VfWfjE,if the bad guys 'sparkle' just once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"😂😂😂I'm kinda here for this.

And Lana del Rey collaborating with Ariana Grande and Miley...I'm here for that too"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't understand
RSUq4VfWfjE,is it bad that i came for naomi scott and not that elizabeth girl...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wrong people in a wrong movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's what a cheap upgrade looks like
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pretty cool you can see the costumes from the 1st 2 films in their closet.
RSUq4VfWfjE,She actually smiles in this one everybody! Im shook!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow! Powerpuff Girls movie in real life!! Can't hardly wait.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Patrick Stewart is Charlie 🤨
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Leaving aside the hypocrisy, we know that the main appeal in this type of film is the fight scenes and these actresses do not show to have practiced martial arts enough to be convincing like martial artists, secret agents, or anything of the type. Kristen Stewart is beautiful, more articulate and charismatic, but this sequel seems like a cat-fight. A scene of action is much more exciting and fun when you can see the face of the actress, for the millions she wins could do as Carrie Anne Moss and Charlize Theron. Not showing the face makes it obvious to be a stunt double. Previous versions had problems trying to resemble the Matrix and having many flight scenes, they should have explored more the potential of the actresses as martial artists already they were able to act that if they were true martial artists, mainly Lucy Liu. With 3 months of preparation with any martial art could do better than what was shown in this trailer: basic punch, knee bent and nape scene."
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie winnin already 😁 it gotta crush the box office 💥💥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where's Dylan, Natalie, Alex
I miss them like if you like the first generation angel

RSUq4VfWfjE,holy moly. i defintely need to watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Golden Rule #1 they already f*#%ed up is angels don’t use guns.
This movie will never be better than the original.
The movie industry must running out of movie ideas."
RSUq4VfWfjE,pathetic crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks awful...
RSUq4VfWfjE,mmmm not convinced

RSUq4VfWfjE,More woke trash...Yawn!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella 🤣🤣🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another flop 🤦🏾‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How come everything in Hollywood is either a sequel, remake or reboot. Has creativity died. Liked the bit with Patrick Stewart though."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Traaaaaaaaashhhhhhhhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Snow White and Princess Jasmine have released from the dungeons🌚✋
RSUq4VfWfjE,"nope. you wont get a cent from me for your brown / black / girlwashing SJW bullshit.  Ugly girls casting , bcz ""equality"" and ""diversity"". Again, nope and nope ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,There's no asian?? Am surprised 🤔

RSUq4VfWfjE,I CAN'T WAIT.......to get this on VHS tape
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is that song? Independent Women Pt 1 laughing like crazy right now
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope!
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG😱💗💗💗
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristine Stewart looks sober for the first time in a decade so it’s worth watching
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf where the old angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"kortney kane , jenni lee , mia malkova are my charlie's angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bland. And uninspiring
RSUq4VfWfjE,i dont get why people feel the need to compare
RSUq4VfWfjE,This doesn’t even feel like Charlie’s Angels. It just looks like Totally Spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe but I'll give it a chance.
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAH CENTIENO
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen Stewart.... I'm here just for her 😆😘😘😘😘💟💟💕💕💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder who made this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,No no no no!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,uhmm i think the soundtrack music video should have wrecking balls. ha!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just came here for kisses and sex😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's the most stupidest pose I've ever seen on a thumbnail of a serious movie trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,What’s up with this casting🤨low budget?
RSUq4VfWfjE,is this charlie's angels or elizabeth's angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks : so how many elizabeth banks in the trailer? 

elizabeth banks : YES"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's funny. My initial thought watching this trailer was 'I'm so far out of the target audience so it'd make sense that I wouldn't be into it'.  

But on reflection, I think this movie just looks generic and lazy. It feels like Ocean's Eight where you get these talented women and you give them material by these boring writers (usually a woman and a man so you can't call them sexist) who always fall on the same dumb tropes like ""OOOooOOhhh She just SEDUCED A MAN to THROW HIM OFF GUARD"" and ""These WOMEN have a DANCE SEQUENCE to SHOW HOW EMPOWERED THEY ARE!"" and ""OoooOOOOhhh the TOUGH WOMAN is FLIRTING with the REALLY UNCHARACTERISTICALLY ATTRACTIVE MALE NERD!"". 

It's like, this is so antithetical to what they're setting out to do. These female empowerment movies couldn't be more derivative and bro-y."

RSUq4VfWfjE,Those who want to make any kind of website or app or you want to promote any app plz inbox me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is looking so cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,"U remade Charlie's Angels and didn't cast Charlize Theron, Gal Gadot! !!!???? Casting director could have done a better job"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bill Murray will always be a better Bosley than Elizabeth Banks.  She always annoyed me ever since my days of watching Scrubs, the Pitch Perfect movies, and now I have another reason to be annoyed with her."
RSUq4VfWfjE,first time Kristen Stewart makes a decent movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,That shitty 2000 version isn't starting to look so bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are production companies not releasing new stories
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wouldn’t buy tickets to watch this in theater, but I would be interested in it when it comes out on Redbox. 

The one with Cameron, drew, and Lucy was kind of a cringe fest."
RSUq4VfWfjE,💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,anyone send me your address if you would like some free musick cds
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is what Jasmine do when Aladdin is not around 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,To be honest... 1st one looked way better
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok but I'm sensing kristen stewart redemption from twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok, but one of them is supposed to be red headed"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me or they all have the same nose in the thumbnail lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish they showed more of Elizabeth Banks. I feel like she didnt contribute enough in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Democratic Charlie’s angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,not inclusive enough they should add 1 Asian duh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks cute
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a syndicated 90's TV show
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where are the Twilight shipers at ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Director : How much music do you want 
Cast : Yes yes YES"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So many feminists moviesssssssss... sick of it


I am a woman!! Before u start bashing me.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No Lucy Liu, not watching"
RSUq4VfWfjE,*It's literally Kingsman but with women*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Paris Jackson micheals daughter? He would be proud
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow just what we want, more female power and feminist movements in movies that don’t need to be redone. They even made bosley a woman now and of course they had to add a black angel and change it from the original. 💯💯🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is our new generation Charlie’s Angels?
Where is nice boobs? Sensuality and Tough Women gone?

Rounda Rousey, Gina Carano, Jeeja Yanin should join the cast! 
Bring me McG."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want Drew,  Cameron and Lucy back,  they are the best Angels !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am loving this!!! Girl power
RSUq4VfWfjE,No me gusta
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I didn’t even have to pay to watch the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"actually looks bad, and i like how 2019 is a step backwards to 2001 as there isnt even as asian girl this time"
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLIE'S ANGELS=A HUGE BUCKET OF HOT POOP
RSUq4VfWfjE,When?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m cautious about this reboot, optimistic but cautious."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh yay... Poser Hollywood destroying another Classic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me or I’m I the only one getting fast 7 vibes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well unlike all the idiots in the comments before me, I am excited for this, I love Kristen Stewart, and no not because of Twilight, I loved her before those movies! I also love Elizabeth Banks, and Patrick Stewart too! And though I don't know Ella Balinska , I love her accent, she's British, of course so is Naomi Scott, but they aren't allowing her to use her accent apparently, I guess every American made movie has to have mostly American characters in it! I maybe can understand with this though,  a bit!
What bugs me is when they do a movie set in the future in space and everyone is American, I mean when its supposed to be that these people are the last people alive from earth, they act like only Americans survived! Unless the idea is the US were selfish and didn't even try to save people from other parts of the world, that doesn't seem right! 
Of course usually when American made movies do have British characters, 9 out of 10 times, there the bad people/the villain in the movies! Like all the Resident Evil movies! 
Makes you wonder what does Hollywood have against the British, the have been our allies for at least a couple of hundred years or more! 
I guess some people can't get past the Boston Tea Party times or something! 
But seeing as the British outlawed slavery way before we did, along with other European countries, we really should look ourselves in the mirror, because we are not saints either!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A reboot of a reboot of a tv show.  Hollywood is not even trying to be original anymore.  So whats next Hollywood?  Another Fast and Furious movie?  YES!  Another Rambo movie? YES!  Anything original?  HELL NO!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even all the hate comments can't stop my gay love of badass Kristen Stewart. Sry not sry!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"who's here because of princess Jasmine ""Naomi""😂💚,,I loved her in Aladdin so much 💫"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen should keep the long blonde locks. Oh my!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a bad feeling about this !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugggghhhhh.........WTF am I supposed to say after this abomination?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Right There. Deep Down. You know. This movie is going to be bad 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like hot garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Audi!!!! Yaaas
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll just wait this to be uploaded on facebook just for observation. These angels have no chemistry. I still love, Cameron, Drew and Lucy and no one can replace them as my angels 😍😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm excited for the Title Track more than a movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,If course they got Noah Centimeter
RSUq4VfWfjE,3 Ladies with No Expressions
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters 2 level Word of Mouth or worse
RSUq4VfWfjE,WOKE BS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo......... booooooo this sondes like the worst movie ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We need a James Bond,Charlies Angels and John Wick Universe."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz were so perfect!! This is not even 10% of that! They were more funnier...sexier...and so on!

Miss them!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So exited go to watch 😍 my favorit film before i adult 😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,They really need a “so-so” shaking hand  for videos you’re not sure about.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will watch this movie just for *Kristen Stewart*  & release the background song.... Love it 😍💓🤟🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stewort......still a terrible actor.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like if uh see this to see Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There is genuinely so much wrong with this. Its like an Elizabeth Banks fever dream, with the weirdest cast Ive ever seen. Why even remake this movie? Who signed off on this dumpster fire? Oh wait..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally something that hasn't been done before...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks hot!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks very mediocre
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron Diaz( the sassy and quirky type) , Drew Barrymore (the boyish and risk taker type of gal) , and Lucy Liu (smart and sexy asian) I am still in love with the characters of them."
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a waste of time and money
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came for only Kristen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley is a dude. Fight me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I assure you...

NOBODY ASKED FOR THIS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,profesor x is charles in charles angles?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music is so unfitting
RSUq4VfWfjE,Obviously bossly had a sex change
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is not Charlie's Angel's. Its piss poor!! Horrible!
RSUq4VfWfjE,With today’s political climate I already know the ending.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The g girl off of Aladdin is rude I met her and she totally annoyed a bunch of people Jane
RSUq4VfWfjE,This going to sink harder than Titanic
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mib and ghostbuster, got female actress. Charlies’s angel should get male actor. Why is only female replacing male role? Lol wtf equality?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can you imagine if Elizabeth Banks made a cameo in this? That would be crazy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one can beat the original Charlie's Angels. THEY'RE THE BEST❤️ But I want to watch this one. Looks cool 😎 👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well well a lot of complaining..  no Asian ?.. Naomi is half indian. 
Ppl: it doesn't mean she is Indian
Well suit yourself this angels r amazing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Id smash the black British chick in a heartbeat dammit
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well i know this is a remake, however,  don't forget add the classic Charlie's angels' theme song."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Chava anda triunfando , qué tal ? XD haha me encanta ese actor!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow another shitty reboot!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thats a bit dirty ""meh"" from me. Original still seems better"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did you guys know Elizabeth banks is in this???
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kinda looks like trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wish Ariana, Miley and Lana del Rey were Charlie's Angels. lols!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just wanna say Cameron Diaz drew barrymore and Lucy lui AINT DEAD YET!! WTF
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just wish they showed more of Elizabeth Banks role in this movie, did she produce it?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why no asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not even 20 seconds into the trailer and we've already started with feminist propaganda.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish the black girl was dark skin since she replaced the red head but of course Hollywood wants a light skinned over dark sin🤦🏾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks like there a leader in the group. No great friendship in this version?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tar 21 from mw2 classic
RSUq4VfWfjE,way to suck all the fun out of charlie's angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,This remake needs justice
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks Upside Down Illuminati Confirmed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,#26 on trending street
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are smartphones damaging our human brains to come up with something original?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can only see two members are outstanding, unlike the 2000 version. The previous angles are all outstanding and very unique and perfectly matched."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, but I don't plan on watching this. If I do, it's because it will be on tv or I'm bored out of my mind."
RSUq4VfWfjE,EPIC FAILURE ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this feel like it’s going to be generic group of spies fight generic Russian or middle eastern warlord for control of generic super weapon
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female power...equal right. Men step aside
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Directed, produced, written *AND* starring Elizabeth Banks...

Crap... I'm having ""The Room"" flashbacks!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This ain’t it fam
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi is so disney princess that shes not a type of angry angel that wants to kill somebody..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this a new disney movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dude we’re not supposed see Charlie stoopid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another flop

RSUq4VfWfjE,"2 words
farrah Fawcett!- period!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please not another women are better than  men movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,nope!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks more like Elizabeth Banks' Angels than Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t be the only one that thinks this is going to be bad. The casting for the angels was a big miss..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idk but i kinda expecting a chinese badass as one of em :v
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please don't make the movie about femisism. With feminist one liners and stuff. It'll make the movie a cringe fest.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They haven't learned have they? This looks if anything even worse than Full Throttle!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stopped a minute in. It's literally giving away the whole movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ughhhhh ill watch this for that jasmine girl from alladin
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is so multi-talented! Looking forward to this! 😃
RSUq4VfWfjE,No Asian replacement for Lucy liu? Come on man.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"C Angels soooooooooooooo 70's, Crap!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least they include a Asian actress
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whack ! Put bruce jenner instead...oh forgot his new name
RSUq4VfWfjE,y charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me or does this looks more like a spinoff TV show?
RSUq4VfWfjE,*who else came here for ARI!!!!!*
RSUq4VfWfjE,more retarded full SJW cast Bosley's name is JOHN not JANE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie should be a woman and her angels should be three scary looking fat dudes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles x Xavier walking 🚶?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sassy. And I see that Charlie still loves his/her anonymity. 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is gorgeous!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Academy Award..
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie will flop real bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,anyone catch what's said at 0:20 ? i can't make it out and it's kinda been driving me nuts lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,That moment when the theme song is more anticipated than the actual movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Jasmine isn’t busy in Arabia
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why didn’t they remake this with men?
RSUq4VfWfjE,eeeeeew
RSUq4VfWfjE,No. Just no....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fight scene should be more realistic because the in 2000 Era they fight like a real fighter not boring compare to this
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song the only reason to watch the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,its gonna flop so hard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,SHUT. UP!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Something is missing...oh yeh the old cast and magic
RSUq4VfWfjE,yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels from year 2000 was pathetic, but it will become a masterpiece after this new movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eww Kristen....ill sit this one out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Something about the actresses that makes it seem like this movie will not live up to its best potential.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this makes me sick to my stomache
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony must love throwing money away.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Bosley a woman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott our princess ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wildstyle did everything in this movie wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aww~ Naomi Scott is going to be the cute & dorky new recruit 😍😍😍
This movie looks promising, looking forward to seeing it~"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks REAL bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t feel any Charlie’s angel vibe from the trailer. I’ll pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This isn’t Charlie’s Angels...






It’s Elizabeth’s Angels 😑"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not my angels.

*Song: Don't call me angel~*

*NOT MY ANGELS.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like this one than the Drew’s version.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks the way it should have looked from the beginning....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First men in black international and now this, wtf Sony!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,why does this remind me of Barbie Spy Squad 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cameron  drew and lucy  are still sexy enough to still be Charlie's angels. That's just my opinion.
RSUq4VfWfjE,PC SJW...Ruin another series....smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Honestly this looks like garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the gay remake I was hoping for
RSUq4VfWfjE,Corny
RSUq4VfWfjE,But .. why ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A very over edited trailer, couldn't make sense of any of it. Suspect bad movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish I could like this video a HUNDRED times! I need this movie now!!!!! <3 <3 <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like it!

Elizabeth Banks also gave birth to Kristen, Princess Jasmin, and new chick!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana Del Rey brought me here
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sometimes I wish Patrick Stewart was my real father.
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS MOVIE WILL GENERATE.. HUNNDREDS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why does this remind me so much of a grown up, real life version of ""totally spies""?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist Propaganda.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh GIRL! I am so excited!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony rebooting everything no ideas left
RSUq4VfWfjE,"hate the Reboot or not, its nice to see a Charlies Angels movie back on the big screen again."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is disappointing. When is Charlie's Angel's going to be 3 males instead of females...that would be soooooo woke and progressive like the female Ghostbusters
RSUq4VfWfjE,I clicked on this bc I thought it was a joke
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why  just like. L.A fines it going to. Suck 😝
RSUq4VfWfjE,There’s like in Kristen Stuart. Love it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are Batwoman and Ghostbusters 2016 in the same universe?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh hell no! NOT AGAIN!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's AIN'Tgels. Maybe I'll rent
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought it was Emma Watson😂😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is it with women actors now they all look the same
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm wondering....does this Movie star Elizabeth Banks?????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another cool show slaughtered
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m ready to be gay for Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,#23 on trending street
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh the song sounds like ALL Ariana wtf I’d rather hear a song that’s 50% Lana 50% Miley and 0% Ariana lol just take her out completely instead of all her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is almost as bad as the Batwoman trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"no. just no. stop this. right now. also, noah centineo??? just- no."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well this looks like a bottle blonde dumpster fire by Elizabeth Banks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought I read “Cringe Angels”
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What's this? Another oceans 8 catastrophe? Ghostbusters 2016? Craptain marvel? Pandering garbage that nobody will pay for. I'll watch it for free, if I watch it at all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watching this trailer just made me want to watch the original Charlie's Angels like this is a completely different vibe of movie, it's not the same...why can't they do a reboot with the original cast man!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didnt they learn anything from ghostbusters 2016?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If this fails, I think we all know who to blame."
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:57
RSUq4VfWfjE,Umm I’m excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,what a terrible direction
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't see the problem, lots of corny goofball one liners and explosions and ridiculous over the top stunts just like the last 2. I'm not going to pay to watch them just like the last 2 just saying seems like nothing has changed"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is just,.…,...,.…,…. Terrible"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg looks really stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do women in movies always say they “can do anything” why push it and just do a movie with women
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This would've made a little money without the trailer. Now I know to never view this glossy, ghastly film production."
RSUq4VfWfjE,these are literally the worst actresses in the world..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Young adults this movie is directed at:
What is Charlie's Angels?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It should be named Elizabeth Angels 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg is that noah?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm sorry but ""Directed by Elizabeth Banks"" is not a selling point.  Its telling me to avoid this garbage fire"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This issa joke RIGHT!!!?? They’re not actually going to ruin Charlies angels RIGHT!!!??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"should've casted

Lana Condor
Kristen Stewart
Madelaine Petsch"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a poorly cast piece of crap !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I’m so attracted to Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Highkey pissed there's no asian representation like Lucy Liu this time around
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like Kirsten Stewart..But shes not a Angel..Shes not super hot or that kind of beautiful.Shes beautiful but not a Charlies Angles beauty..The black girl is hot but seems young..And the other..idk she reminds me of a generic Sarah Michelle Gellar but very homely..Just seems like HollyWoods is trying to hard with this one..To be trendy and PC..Too teeny bop as well..Theres cute hot and theres smoking hot..And this is cute ..Thats it..
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like an epic dumpster 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks did every part of this movie from choreograph to directing it ... also is there 3 bosleys in this 🤔🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow es como cuando piensas ...esas películas son realmente malas no se cómo pueden hacer para empeorar la franquicia...y entonces...aparece KS dammmmmm
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In these times of feminist madness, a (bad) remake like this was inevitable, to continue the leftist indoctrination."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can already tell Elizabeth Banks wasting her time and money. Lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn't hate this!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow no creativity in Hellywood anymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,Por que ponen a una negra?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"the fucking ""hi charlie!"" is so weirdly gross. like they're some kind of weird hired harem"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now this is going to be an exciting movie. I can't wait for it. It reminds me so much of the 2003 movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks is a hoe
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no 😩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This trailer is ALL OVER THE DAMN PLACE , they really wanted Miley , Ariana and Lana to save the movie Tf !!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Amaan
RSUq4VfWfjE,Left extremist has a massive Boner right now
RSUq4VfWfjE,Teenagers and virgins be ready
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm not gona watch this.👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's get one damn thing straight Charlie's Angels was all beautiful white girls not fucking mixed thank you
RSUq4VfWfjE,This one actually doesn't look completely stupid. Might have to go see it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I heard Elizabeth Banks was involved with this film, but I could be wrong."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why? What was wrong with the Diaz/Barrymore/Lui/Murray one? Why rehash? Why not create something new, rather than ruining fond memories? Ah, but that is the point isn't it? Is there no franchise you won't destroy to push your politics?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another ruined classic..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought that was Vuj for a sec! @1.53
RSUq4VfWfjE,Чезахрень?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it really a reboot if it’s based off a show from the 70s?

RSUq4VfWfjE,Huh... I didn't know I wanted this...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just realized the logo was wings and not a random triangle
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer: “Starring Kriste-“

RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen’s role so far is on 🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks more like Totally Spies than Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just hope that the director doesn't think ""badass girl = stone-faced emotionless sex doll"" like a lot of directors do..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is running out of ideas
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks juvenile and dumb. Tweens might like it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,We request you please release this movie in india
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley vai ser uma mulher ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Cinemasins has entered chat
RSUq4VfWfjE,Low key upset there isn’t an Asian angel in this version. Lucy Liu was iconic!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Remake challenge: Charlie's angels v. Ghostbusters
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hear Elizabeth Banks is something to do with this......
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one asked for this.... We want the original cast back!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another flop!! What is wrong with this year???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The trailer is ""ok""
But Naomi Scott is 💓."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Morgan Freeman should be in this movie! Why isn't Freeman in this movie!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just wish Kristen Stewart to have a great day. Or a month. Thirty to fourty years, ideally."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait a black angel and a female Bosley? I smell a flop here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope this movie is goes super hit love from INDIA
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:
Movie studios: *R E B O O T !*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,LAME
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hahahahaha this is straight to DVD level garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:46 This guy is the equivalent to the Thin Man?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to awaken so many gays it’s not even funny
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why can't I dislike it like a million times?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is Super Stunning....my cast choice goes to Jennifer   Lawrence. Emma Stone and Zendaya... anyway this Trailer looks BADASS Blonde Bitches Fighting...I love it. soo Excited can't wait.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worst movie ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a remake of the remake....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please dislike it as much as possible!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeeeees!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood doesn't care about doing original stuff anymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,*No thanks*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah is just there.. Not fair dint give him many scenes in the movie 😔😒but it's anyway a chick flick
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why shouldn't I call you angel? Your group is called Charlie's Angels.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier can walk😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,SOUND THE ALARM THEY HAS ESCAPED THE KITCHEN

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Short films on my channel, subscribe please"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"drew, lucy liu, cameron d still the best angels ever 🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Normal
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it the Totally Spies trailer? Hahahaha, another feminist fantasy that I will not see. They knew that this is a reboot of a series of the 70s that in turn had a restart in the 2000s, right? Exactly, do not do anything new my little Mary Sue!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cringe , pure cringe!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood: How many classics you want to destroy?

Directors: yassss"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When 90 lb girls beat up grown men...

I laugh."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks so much better with short hair!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isn’t it cool that us 90’s and early 2000’s babies who used to watch CA as kids will see 2 “generations” of Charlie’s Angels <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,Peak Bosley was Bernie Mac RIP
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay but imagine if Ariana, Miley and Lana were the three Charlie's angels?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A remake no one asked for. Except for Elizabeth Banks I assume.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Security guards: *proceed to stand there while boss is being violently choked with a curtain*
RSUq4VfWfjE,BIG SHOUTOUT TO MY AUNT MAHA WHO DID THE MAKEUP ON THIS PRODUCTION! LOVE YOU MAHA!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie will be total cancer .

Adding it to the get woke go broke casualty list."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another woke bulshit !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh Kristen one facial expression Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh Kristen one facial expression Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feel more like a totally spie movie than a charlie angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies than Charlie's angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,This elite agency which operates outside the law............with only 2 agents in it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stewart just hit the bell icon
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:44 you can see costumes from the previous films. That's a cool Easter egg, makes you wonder what other Easter eggs will be in the movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This would’ve been cooler as Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You guys, this is so much better than I anticipated. There are no cheesy gimmicks here - I'm sold!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yes....women are cool, we get it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whyyyy ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,The trailer is awesome..... But the artists OMG it's gonna blow up!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Brd pit...lionard and tom.....bring thm togtr
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:24 cgi looks fake AF
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not a fan of Elizabeth banks I think she's gonna ruin it I like the ""waitress"" i forgot her name"
RSUq4VfWfjE,@1:40 you can see the old costumes used by the previous charlies angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:02 That looks a lot like GTA Vice City.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looking hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"E L I Z A B E T H

B A N K S"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't understand that how Anna Hathaway , Scarlett Johansson with Kristen Stewart is not the first choice for Charlie's Angels?!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Elizabeth banks in this movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not woke enough.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another iconic brand and cultural touchstone ruined by greed and a lack of original ideas in Hollywood. The 2000s remake was awesome - this looks like crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a female kingsman movie but not as great
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks as Charlie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism destroys another classic movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That moment when you see a trailer, and instantly know it will be a bomb."
RSUq4VfWfjE,If the ghostbusters can be girls why can’t we have dude angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,O Arap kıyafetleri Türkiye'de giyilmiyor ki..?
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:24 Kristen Stewart looks attractive and I like that.🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg who made this movie!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I would very much like Hollywood to do a biopic on Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesperson and now convicted felon,  roly-poly-boy-toy and daily punching bag for any number of his fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Englewood, Colorado. 

Perhaps it could be a musical.   One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning. 

Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared."" 

You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.  I ended up getting mauled by their German Shepherd who had been watching CNN a week or so earlier."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I half expected Charlie to be a woman...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did they cast someone who is 2 feet taller than the others?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I feel no one actually says things like ""just because woman can do anything, doesn't mean they should."". This is the problem with almost all Women-centric movies, the sexism (which exists) is blatant, unlike the real world.
Or maybe as a guy, I don't know anything."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I watched this just to hear 4 seconds of Lana lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,I may watch just cause naomi Scott is in it😍💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a piece of trash!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like an SJW dumpster fire, another flop for Hollywood."
RSUq4VfWfjE,When your the only one that worked on the group project
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a ALL Female Ghostbusters Part 2.  That's a hard pass for me dawg......
RSUq4VfWfjE,Poor
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Get woke go broke, this looks so fucking bad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Every year Hollywood makes blockbusters, comedies, drama, Oscar worthy, independent, and then the movies that barely make their budgets."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I didn't care for the last reboot so I can't say I have high expectations for this. I like the cast, though. I just hope that if this movie stinks we don't have to listen to people screaming that the negative reviews are the result of sexism rather than admit it's flaws. And, since I'm on that topic, I really hope it doesn't get any unfair & sexist criticism. Mainly because those in that camp usually hate it when male dominated franchises are converted to female dominated, but Charlies Angels is a female franchise and always has been. Rate this movie on it's merits, please."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm waiting for songs
RSUq4VfWfjE,"👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Não vejo a hora de estrear o novo filme das panteras c minha querida e amada Kristen Stewart que amo muito, e admiro atriz e a pessoa boa sorte 🙏💓🥰😘💋 pra todas"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought Hollywood said guns were bad? These girls sure like their guns. I'm confused.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw 5 times the name eLizAbeTH BanKs
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hot trailer 🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley was a man, was white, then black, now a woman?  I give up.  I've also never heard of any of these people."
RSUq4VfWfjE,DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THE CUSTOMES FROM THE OLD FILMS 0.o
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks so cringeeeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,and SJW ruin another movie franchise nice work Sony
RSUq4VfWfjE,Poor Patrick Stewart don't deserve this u.u
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate trailers who shows whole movie in just 2 mins
RSUq4VfWfjE,just one thing... im sorry but why do all of the outfits look really cheap and lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I need to watch the 2000's masterpiece to feel better, this is so unnecessary"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's a no for me dog
RSUq4VfWfjE,"guessing this will have around a 20% range on RT, will be surprised it if gets higher"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*One is highest ranking CIA general...*

*One is P4P UFC World Champion...*

*And one is a Bi transgender mixed race presidential candidate Kung-fu sensai...*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow actually looks interesting. Im surprised most just go for men bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,wheres the asian representation they used to have  and why did they have to replace her with a black person like ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, who’s the director?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whattt
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Totally Spice. 🤣🤣🤣 this trailer is not really thrilling to see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im the ""only gonna watch for Kristen Stewert"" button"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wht 2019 be like ???

Elizabeth banks :look , that's wht 2019 be like 🔥🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin Stuart looks like a boss I’m gonna scream 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,A feminist’s wet dream
RSUq4VfWfjE,i am surprisingly excited for this. Like nothing can touch the original movies but i am always up for badass females being ... well badass =)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay, who is Patrick Stuart? I thought he was Charlie for a moment... Guess not."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is pure cringe here...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ruined by female only lead.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks cheap, like TV show quality, WTF!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we just take a moment to appreciate Kristen Stewart actually wearing makeup for once!?  The woman is gorgeous with and without it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'd have been excited only if the angels were Miley, lana and ari instead."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love you Bella swem.  I miss you next part twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,So many dislikes.. Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie just looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sucks!!!!💩🖕👎👿👹👺💀☠
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh dear I feel I should apologise for some reason
RSUq4VfWfjE,whos it by again
RSUq4VfWfjE,","
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am thinking Charlie never mind got confused with the names sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,Booo these little weak looking children are supposed to trick us into thinking they can pull back slides to firearms flip punch and do all this action without breaking their weak little bones?? Blah Liz Banks stick to that terrible game show. The previous Charlies Angles were impressive. Hell the fake angles from scary movie were more believable.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey, did you guys know Elizabeth Banks was in this?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine & Princess Snow White have left their kingdoms to become world class spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I find it weird that they meet Bosley and its not Morgan Freeman I don't know if I will like it. One of the reasons I liked Charlies Angels is that Bosley was always hiding and the girls didn't know who he/she was:(
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels: Elizabeth Banks Edition
RSUq4VfWfjE,They made a movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,At last
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally at leadt
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlize Theron's character from Atomic Blonde could take all of them blind folded.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need to know who directed it and who wrote the screenplay. Also who’s the blonde Bosley.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Think ill watch carlies angels 2 rather than see that
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love From India
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even an everyday person like myself can already tell this is gonna be a flop. Who on earth greenlit this idea?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody asked for this..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Might as well rename the movie to Elizabeth's angel's
RSUq4VfWfjE,ima just casually watch it for the ari collab
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not competition 1st & 2nd Charles Angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,We missed Cameron's cute smiles
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If some of these blows up, why in hell you smack it out of her hands?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How did ""And Patrick Stewart."" Not come up on screen!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A Soundtrack without Prodigy and Apollo 440....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rest in peace Sony pictures.
RSUq4VfWfjE,But ela balinska is a piece of crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is damn funny
RSUq4VfWfjE,ang itim namn ng kilikili nung nasa 1:38
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can't wait to see this. 
Love you Stewart 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So I not watching this movie. In theaters. Will catch on dvd
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only here for Ari lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,What
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why do we need a remake?, they've finally ran out of movie ideas, its gonna be trash anyways."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should make a movie now called “Charlie of the Angels” where we see Charlie in his youthful super agent days before he got relegated behind a desk and a secret intercom.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really obscene
RSUq4VfWfjE,it's so bad. please don't..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ee pandaram theernille
RSUq4VfWfjE,ariana didnt look cute in this trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s a Asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one cud replace cameroon
RSUq4VfWfjE,it's nice to see kristen with new facial expressions
RSUq4VfWfjE,Very impressed with Kristen Stewart in this trailer. She looks interesting to watch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally a decent movie can’t wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,BORING
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lesbian as a Charlie Angel.

WHY THE FRICK ARE MOVIES TRYING TO BE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE?!?! NOT NECESSARY"
RSUq4VfWfjE,lol now Charlie's Angel will also have LGBTQ Retardness
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible. 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thanks for joining hanshi khuahi vines video on YouTube.  This video will show you the following video.  To view pictures and videos, you subscribe to our channel and give a message so that we can also subscribe to your channel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:20 0:26 From shutting off Andrew Yang's mic to this. Why does the media hate asian men so much?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jeremy from geeks and gamers was right about this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"TOTALY SPIES LIVE ACTION

WTF DISNEY WHY REHASH THIS!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Blockbuster 💝💖❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley isn't a girl please stop remaking movies this looks horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah ! No thanks .
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Feel a like it wants to be 80's 
Almost screams 2000's with music 
But is just modern action film with women 

Call this anything eles, just had to slap Charlie's angels on it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine and Snow white 😌
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woow... new charlie's angels!!!! 💕💕💕💕 so cool!! Cant to wait!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think we should give the new movie a chance ;-;
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for Lana. ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woooooooooooowhuuuuuuuu.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here to see  Naomi🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism to the fullest Bosley supposed to be a man
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope they aren’t suppose to be feme fatales throughout the whole movie. The original Angels were very competent professionals and classy ladies too. Also, the girls next door who were just a whole lot smarter than the men they were encountering."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Bosely is a woman, and so are the angels. I'm surprised Charlie isn't either.... Feminist logic am I right?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Better then captin marvel
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me after watching this: I'm like soo gay, dude!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,MISSING MY MAIN GIRL LUCY LIU BUT OK
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is in this. That's enough to make sure I never watch this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew, Cameron, and Lucy should of been mentors to the younger recruits."
RSUq4VfWfjE,the new charlies angels are not hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't call me angel  ""
How about ___
(Just reply your suggestion ,what should we call them )"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't believe they can put this trailer in { HD }😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No body :


Action movies have to add Rich Arab"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy Liu, with my girl Drew, and Cameron D,

These are the best Angels imo."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waste of time and money
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice cant wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stewart = fk NO!
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Perfect casting
RSUq4VfWfjE,"After MIB international, I don't want to lose hope in this series."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wasted my 2:53 min time
WTF
Worst"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Here's that flop you asked for, boss."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sounds boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks is new khaleesi
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOOOOOOOORRRRRRIIIINNNGGGGG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Last Trinity was great
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Such weird casting... Even the song is by 3 artists you wouldn't expect to work together.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love the 2000s version so much. At first, I was like, oh no not the remake again, until I saw Kristen Stewart in short hair I'm like okay...I'm down for this!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,love it how people in the comments already watched the movie before everyone
RSUq4VfWfjE,Múic
RSUq4VfWfjE,The likes on this trailer are fake
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still waiting on the all male reboot 😡
RSUq4VfWfjE,There is no chemistry at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOBODY asked for this ... these morons in Hollywood need to make NEW movies .. not new versions of old ones .. get it together
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really Hollywood!? Why? I guess all new ideas for movies is out we have to keep remaking these shows 😒 the movie industry is out! Bye bye Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this supposed to be this cheesy
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the most cringe video I have ever seen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS LOOKS alright...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boswell is a bloke not female, the angels were females they kicked but and we hardly ever so Charlie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow. Something that was actually about empowered females to begin with but they have to go and make Bosley a woman too. 

I hope this bombs like Hiroshima."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The women aren't even sexy. The women who play Charlie Angel's are supposed to be seductive and sexy. Now it's just woke. SJW's ruin everything.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boring, bad choice of actors"
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I see is a lot of wigs...
RSUq4VfWfjE,*vahhh kya bend bajayi he Angeles ne men's ki lagta he girl are more powerfull* 💪💪💪😂😂😂👌👌👌🌹🌹🌹💕💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,"短髪じゃなくてロングが良かった。
あと時代を反映してゲイを入れなくて良かったのかな？
キモいけど"
RSUq4VfWfjE,ultra boring trailer... the old charlie angels were outstanding..
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is it folks. We've reached the end of Hollywood.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Did anyone that notice the blue jumpsuit with stars on it, in the closet, that was worn by the Angels in the previous movie (Barrymore, Diaz and Lui)?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they have a clueless girl join in why couldn’t she be prepared 😞😞😞😞😩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a fun movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,One word Stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,im really really surprised they didnt change Charlie into a woman
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony was so caught up in whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think that they should."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is everyone complaining? I was BORN ready for this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is it that young actors now have no charisma. This looks visually cool but boring.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Noah??? OOOOAAAAHHH
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:09 omg kristen did a half smile
RSUq4VfWfjE,look like a total shitbird
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Garbage. Feminists, LGBTQ, diversity completely changes Charlie's Angel's. Call the movie some other name because Charlie's Angel's is not this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh....
RSUq4VfWfjE,👏👏👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,"To forget for a moment that there is such a movie already.  



I think he should be given a chance."
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:11 is that Aaron Carter?
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi scott 💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weak spin off
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this the PART II....🤔??
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a steaming pile of dreck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks trash smh. Whole cast just no
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why am I not excited. I want Lucy, Cameron and Drew"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Anyone else feel the music was a bit too distracting, and made it hard to understand/pay attention to the actual trailer?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm actually really excited for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Clickbait.. where is the angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"C'mon man, Bella from that fake vampire movie twighlight. Hell no. Not an Angel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so 2019😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Power pack 🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen's hairstyle must be inspired by gwen spiderverse
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Is Elizabeth Banks in this movie?*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I rather much have Kate Upton, Hanna Simone, and Gabriella Rodriguez with Carlie's Angels with William Daniels as Charlie and the 1970s version anything but this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg Kristen Stewart still has zero acting ability. There is something called facial expression
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible....
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original movie is still the best!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Some things should be left alone.
RSUq4VfWfjE,who watch indians
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All of you people are haters, y’all don’t know the plot of the movie yet you are riding the hate train. Open your minds and accept the new movie as it is"
RSUq4VfWfjE,where is lucy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im not gonna lie this movie is gonna be really bad but I saw comments made by men that were just pure disrespect against women, I get that this movie is a little too much about “women are better than men” but you dont get to insult us juste cause a movie is bad alright, insult the movie if u have too but dont insult women, u dont get to insult us and then complain that “Holywood is all about girl power now”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female version of fast and furious and mission impossible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Bella Swan and Pink Ranger* ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart punching and smiling and blowing things up is STRANGE
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No Asian angel??! 
Must not be funded by Chinese then !!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Femnazi detected, instant dislike."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow the creators of this trailer sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,MORE FEMINIST CRINGE !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gay as Fck like this comment if they should get the original Charlie’s angels cast back
RSUq4VfWfjE,Carefull there are some feminist out here in comments section
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,That end pose is everything.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks needs to bank on the fact that her name wasn't put in enough times in the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am i the only one who thinks Naomi scott is looks like camila cabello?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now i know who is Charlie's ( Charles Xavier)
RSUq4VfWfjE,A B S O L U T E   C R I N G E
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Say what you will about the 2 Charlie's Angels movies with Barrymore, Liu and Diaz but at least they were fun. This just looks horrid."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They just keep remaking movies and people still go and pay to see something they already saw fucking hell.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth banks is so humble you never know she made something because she never gets into the spotlight
edit:- thx for the likes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’d rather play the video game for Game Cube till completion....





For those of you who don’t know, the video game had a notorious glitch that made the third level play on repeat over and over again. Combined with the awful gameplay, the video game was absolute hell."
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks bad. The girls in the original were funny.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like the theme song from the 2000 version better. I also liked that Drew Barrymore as producer had a no guns mandate on the story so that upped the creativity on how bad guys were taken out. This... just doesn’t look all that fun; sorry but hard pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’d go from bisexual to lesbian for Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Esta chida
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like telugu viewers ❤❤❤💯👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,Endless trash!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bernie Mac be turning in his grave.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Pretty sure they won't have a man take credit for a woman's work... at least Kristen looks hot as usual
RSUq4VfWfjE,I haven't watched the video but I bet that one of them is a lesbian
RSUq4VfWfjE,"hmmm no. can you please bring bag Drew, Cameron and Lucy?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😱  OMG. Can't wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is so uncalled for, but I’ll still watch this prolly next year when already available for online streaming. 😍😎🤩"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks really wants everybody to know, that this pile of sh*t is her pile of sh*t, and her's alone...  Who greenlit this?  
I realize that this is only a trailer, but wow... this looks awful and boring."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So the woke SJWs decided to brownwash two white characters then they cry when whites do this. This is the trashy world we live in and I wish that a world like this comes to an end soon because the system is so full of corruption that you could fill the entire Hoover Dam
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me, Hey who can make the worst movie of the whole year? 

Sony"" you rang?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a load of crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stunning and brave

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks hot in this Elizabeth banks looks hot in everything I'm a guy but I love strong hot women apparently I'm one of a few
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, this looks bad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who’s ready for another disappointing remake of something beloved? I sure am
RSUq4VfWfjE,The angels have NO chemistry!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's definitely a pass for me thanks.

 😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"get woke, go broke"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They couldn’t Ghostbusters/Oceans this one since the main characters were already female... so they replaced *Bill fucking Murry’s* character -drum roll please - with Elizabeth Banks. That’s Elizabeth Banks by the way. In case you missed it, that’s Elizabeth Banks right there where Bill Murry should be... and *everywhere* else in this next installment in the reboot abortion cinematic disasterverse."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thought i saw abella danger in the thimbnail lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hm, this looks generic and uninteresting."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Which one is the trans?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"IDC what people say in the comment, i’m still watching it ‘cause it looks badass and Charlie’s Angels have been my OG childhood [s]heroes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will people please quit hiring kristen stuart shes a fuken horrible actress!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s Aaaannn... Aaannnnggg.... nope can’t say that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana's lovely voice made it perfect 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels? More like Elizabeth's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,You'll never forget Elizabeth Banks....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism at its best... plot twist Charlie is a girl now
RSUq4VfWfjE,why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they need three different people to be Bosley?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah nah thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boooooo No oriental angel??! fuk it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop this now.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Awww:)  Strong and independent women and they don't need no men!
It's adorable:)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dude it looks ok but the old C. Angel's, they were truly amazing, these newbies better prove me wrong!😄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should have brought more sexier actresses
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just want the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,i couldnt finish to watch  the trailer ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok, at-least they didn’t force womanhood down our throats like the Batwoman trailer."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who plays bosley? I cant find her name? 🤔🤔🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weak af
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony just brings us one shitty movie after another
RSUq4VfWfjE,If they took on the role of porn stars it would be more interesting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was like excited for this for a moment and then remember the old  Charlie Angels. I need help.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pwede pwede 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is here for Kristen Stewart?😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like the Big Bang Theory of action movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi scott 🔥🔥🔥yasss first aladdin now Charlie's angels

RSUq4VfWfjE,Can you tell me what role ariana grande?

RSUq4VfWfjE,Ruined
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The song is boring. It's just Ariana Grande singing with her airy, nasaly voice over and over. The Destiny's Child song screamed POWER!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naahh next...
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's a feminist 💩💩💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,who made this movie again?
RSUq4VfWfjE,even though I loved the old Charlies angels I wouldn't mind giving this a try
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony pictures is trying really hard to go broke. 🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not knocking it but also not interested
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love Kristen each day more
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a sequel according to Elizabeth Banks. You can even see the clothes that the previous angels wore at 1:44. This is not a reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women directors making more garbage for garbage feminists.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Much more ugly and expression less !
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the actual hell?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"pink ranger team up with Rita Repulsa, lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No Asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"in all honesty. i'm not feeling it. but if my girls want to go see this, i'm going just to encourage other women to make cool stuff. the ones we have not kinda suck. booksmart was amazing though."
RSUq4VfWfjE,If Thom green isn’t in it I don’t want to watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohh nooo. I miss the original cast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow it realy is the year of reboots no original ideas anymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,How can there be CharliesAngers without Cameron and Drew and Lucy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Huh ......never gonna top original angels Cameron Lucy drew
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tbh I don’t see the point of having Lana and Miley in the song cause I can only hear Ariana,Miley has a very minimal part and Lana Del Ray isn’t detected by my ears(Not hating but just saying there was no point of having all three women in the song when only one is allowed to shine)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No Cameron No Drew No Lucy No Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,You can already tell this movie is going to be awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry did Elizabeth Bank have anything to do with this movie? I wasn't sure
RSUq4VfWfjE,If women just stayed in kitchen we would all be better off
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart 💋she looks awesome!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart smiling is all I can ask for in a movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to see Priyanka chopra in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks horrible, terrible,  awful, waste of time, remakes suck, bad, lame, wack, garbage, anyone think of any other words to describe it?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't think Naomi Scott fit to be an angel., just saying😅"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth who?
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:50 KIngsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll watch anything with Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes! One of my favourite spy movie franchise is getting rebooted. Now we need an Agent Cody Banks reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:40 Starring, Cameo, screenplay and directed by Elizabeth Banks. How genius and rich she is."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart looks more... alive
RSUq4VfWfjE,Critical Drinker brought me here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ZZZZZZZZZZ!!! Boring!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ahh stupid.. kristen is hot tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,Professor X is Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks cheesy and dumb... I’m so  here for it! 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be a trashy cashgrab just like every other noah centineo movie. Theyre obviously trying to draw in a young crowd.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bella and Charlie😂😂
I miss twilight"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is insanely amazing ❤ love kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nah, it could be better. I would of had them go against the old Charlie’s Angels. The three would have been White/British, Black/African, & Hispanic"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another OVERLY dramatized EXCESSIVELY CG movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just here for Lana ☺️😏
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart?? That’s unexpected.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Elizabeth Banks involved with this movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This comment was written, produced and directed by Elizabeth Banks"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:46 discount Robert Patrick?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks more like a straight to Netflix kinda film...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don’t believe it🤨
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can anyone explain to me why the studio even greenlit this dumpster trash?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will not ever watch a movie with stew in it lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yay!!!!! More women in action.......I love this
RSUq4VfWfjE,To be honest they are way way way boring. Did not make me interested in this movie. I think it is gonna be bust
RSUq4VfWfjE,yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,100% Charlie turns out to be a female.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should make a movie about me doing nothing all day. <— Oscar worthy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,20 bucks says they treat guys shitty the whole movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's Not A Handsome Nerd！
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""don't call me angel"" yet Charlie calls them angels 🤦‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony pictures make trailer with 21:9  rasio.. Remember me on my dream phone Xperia 1 wkwkwk
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES ILYYYYU
RSUq4VfWfjE,They ruined it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am rebooted out not gonna see it
RSUq4VfWfjE,ilove Charlie's angels movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is so stupid! You know the dumb, fun original movies? Make them dumb without the fun!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think Elizabeth banks is involved in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,WE STAN
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bro why y'all gotta kill the asian first?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay... stop 2019 I want to get off!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ay siii... las chicas super poderosas!!...un monton de Mary Sue para variar...monton de basura junta en una sola pelicula...
RSUq4VfWfjE,The answer to a question nobody asked ... please stop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh great another movie series being dug up from it's grave only to be used for money.

Is hollywood running of ideas or something?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks like ellen..
RSUq4VfWfjE,gARBAGE
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the hell is Princess Jasmine doing here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmm; I wonder what possible reason Sony would have for wanting to reboot this? :/
RSUq4VfWfjE,DOES ANYONE ELSE NOT HEAR LANA IN THE SONG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tryhards
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like I just watched the whole movie from the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Horrible.  Terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I understand Elizabeth banks put who is her bank account with ? Halifax, Lloyds, HSBC?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That's what's considered ""handsome"" now?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sigh...Reboots, Remakes, and sequels this is all Hollywood knows bringing back died franchises. 

So here is a reboot NO ONE ask for but greedy hollywood executives.

Oh and Elizabeth banks cant forget greed like herself."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is Gorgeous.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Banks is very talented and charming, not too sure about the other two tho... I can't really see them filling the shoes of the orginal trio..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well it looks not that teribble actually. I never watched Charlie's Angels. And I'm not gonna probably but I can watch this if it's on TV haha.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even before scrolling down i was pretty sure that most people must have hated it. And that feeling when you see you're right 🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cameron diaz is better 👍👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAH. As simple as that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,it seems to lack the style of the 2000 movie it's not meant to be in the real world but an exagerated version
RSUq4VfWfjE,I still love the original music of charlie's angels.. they shouldn't changed it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omfg Naomi ❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,By Hideo Koj... Wait Elizabeth Banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another crappy remake Hollywood is just a massive compost heap. Let's see the rotten tomato score on it. Maybe Google will change it !!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,from princess jasmine to a spy!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait this was a movie trailer. It honestly had the looo of cw tv show
RSUq4VfWfjE,No to Kristen Stewart being on the the them nope nope don’t like it one bit
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbageeeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,Low budget movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I said this in the batwoman trailer and I’m gonna say it again THE FEMINISTS ARE TAKING OVER 






im an adult virgin"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Petition for an all-male remake of Charlie’s Angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,i hate these corny new generation spin offs wtf !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only for Naomi Scott 🤴
RSUq4VfWfjE,if i wasnt gay before..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why y’all hating this seem like something, not big but it look entertaining"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The budget was less and the singers charged too much
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait a FUCKING second. Is that.... is that emotion on Kristen Stewart’s face?!?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,i like the old one

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm not sure but did Elizabeth Banks made this?????
Can anyone tell




Did she???????????"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Three beauties in a nutshell 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:44 is that the outfit Drew Barrymore wears in the first Charlies Angles movie? You know, the scene where she is seducing that guy at the race track."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Noah Centimeter?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shitty movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dumb and stupid and I Hvent even watched the trailer yet
RSUq4VfWfjE,A must miss!

RSUq4VfWfjE,A lot of cranky old men in this comment section...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uh oh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here's a movie nobody asked for.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant they find better looking cast ? Seriously like wtf !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Because women smaller than me have enough muscle mass to hit harder than Bruce Lee.  It's just science.
RSUq4VfWfjE,💯💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,All the misogynist freaks hating on the trailer just because there are female leads in this makes me sick
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is definitely gonna suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I used to watch the original series as a kid, I didn't mind the 2 Drew Barrymore movies but this looks terrible!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I refuse
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 who plays the lesbo
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So going with the obvious theme of this movie, will Charlie be non-binary? Bosworth was turned into a woman and I’m sure SJW made sure there was plenty of virtue signaling in this movie too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Owwhooooo Kristen 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
RSUq4VfWfjE,i miss the original charlie’s angels..

RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for Kristin. shez amazing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Music choice is really weird
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't like how men and women are always being pitted against each other, as if men are somehow inherently bad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Poor Patrick Stewart getting dragged into this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,gone all hi-tech...!!!!   like kingsman....not for me
RSUq4VfWfjE,the reboot no one asked for :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another one....?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,why tf is noah centimayo in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will be like the new ghost buster's... a flop 🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Juz for Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was this just 3 minutes? It felt like it lasted forever. It's just so bad...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another feminazi flick that's guaranteed to bomb! More like ""Charlie's Imps!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was with it until I saw Elizabeth Banks as Bosley. It's not a gender thing btw, it just seems hamfisted and self-inserting."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The tall girl's expressions look so dead. Even more dead than Kirsten lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"oh men, here is the next disaster"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I AM HERE FOR THIS HUNTyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible. Kristin Stewart can't fight...c'mon! I hope this movie bombs.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, like aren't Charlie's Angels supposed to be beautiful and hot? Then why these 3 b team ho's? What a joke. The talent pool in Hollywood has dried up completely."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already hate this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everything look rotten other than Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a high budget flop like Waterworld. But I actually liked Waterworld unlike this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eagerly waiting to see 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,No star power.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow the people who don't like this are such haters don't rain on my little party 🌈 the energy ladies 😂

RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks. Ok. We get it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am very excited bcz of kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm wondering if sony even watched the disaster that is Charlie's Angels Full throttle. but i guess they want money
RSUq4VfWfjE,"An agent that is a vampire
An agent that is an arabic princess
An agent flirting with Peter Kavinsky

*Great*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate that they are Charlie’s Angels that’s sexist because it shows ownership of women
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well now I don’t have to waste money on seeing this in the cinema. Cheers
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It’s gunna bomb , did not feel excited or nothing about this movie =\"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid because don't know about the one girl but Naomi whatever from addlian and Kristen Stewart are terrible actresses like Aladdin was okay cause of will and the guy who did Aladdin but she was terrible same with Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,yes.. i'll go watch it.. umm.. maybe i'll go watch it.. umm do i really wanna watch it.. i'll think i'll wait 5 years till Netflix release this movie..
RSUq4VfWfjE,New season of American Top Model looks rather promising but what’s up with the guns?..
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks too serious. The 2000's versions were over the top fun and silly.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wahmen are as tough as men the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously kristen.   You chose to get paid for this with your talent im a bit dissapointed
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's too Mission Impossible-ish, we need fun and humorous Charlie's Angels as Cameron, Drew, and Lucy did."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The newest entry into the Hollywood’s FemPorn Genre.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"And yet, another shitty remake....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier be training angels after mutants.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I bet half of budget was spent on wigs
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Finally... childhood movie*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it bad that I checked how much longer the trailer was a minute into it because I was already bored?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"SJW ATTACK🤣🤣🤣

You did NOT disappoint, YouTube :D"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m sure this will rate well....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I keep confusing Elizabeth Banks with Chelsea Handler
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im gonna skip it
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many are gonna be angry lesbian??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Best part of the trailer and probably movie? Hearing what sounds like John Forsythe's voice on that speaker.  THAT'S what gives me chills---not some cheap remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So is Elizabeth Banks credited as doing everything in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many wig they have?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok first thoughts doesn't look bad but 2 problems I see is one the song and 2 I think it will probably bomb in the box office
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is looks like a clone version of kingsmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just came here for my thumbs down
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks great producer and storyteller
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thanks🙏🙇
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't call me angel""

RSUq4VfWfjE,This just looks like a live action Barbie movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Emma looks stunning
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be the worst movie of 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woman cant beat up men but Hollywood likes to push false feminists projections
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell naw lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else are here for the theme song :))
RSUq4VfWfjE,is it just me or did anyone else mistook Kristen stewart for Bieber
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The company made a big mistake by rebooting a beloved classic that was already a female main cast. Now they can’t claim that people hate it because it’s girls, we all know that it’s just plain bad, full stop."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This comment section is really something else
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth you beauty Waiting For movie!!!!
Girls Rocking lit 💙💙💙💙"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awww I'm waiting for it 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Searching for positive comment man...... it's really hard to find😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"And to people saying ""enough with remakes"", remember it's based on an episodic TV show. Each big screen outing is just another episode."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Heere indian 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does anyone not see the repetition and the brainwashing ?? how many time are we going to see films remake themselves yet people are buying into it it’s crazy . WAKEUP WORLD your buying into the lies .

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I m kinda excited for the new single more than this movie.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are my Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one excited for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am hoping this is just a poorly edited trailer because of not it looks like it has been casted incorrectly, the tone of the film and comedic timing is off and slightly looks like one of those pretend films that appear in movies about movies!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmin!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look at the squad women's world cup
RSUq4VfWfjE,background song sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,congratulations on ruining another classic

20% for the casts
70% for singers

wow thanks for 1 thousand likes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want these 3 minutes of my life back
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least they had the sense not to go full Girl Power like the Batwoman trailer. There was a probably an early cut of this that was much worse.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For all haters out there: 





F U ❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer perfectly shows how worst this movie is 😆😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is in it so you know its going to be bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bruh everyone's talking about how bad the trailer looks and I'm like ""dayumm Noah Centineo!!!""😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It looks overly cliched., if only Elizabeth Banks made this movie..... Oh wait!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who made this movie ? And what is the name of the actress who played bosley ? I searched but i didn't find anything about her in the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like a boring take on Charlie’s Angels. Like those typical Hollywood spy movies. The one with Lucy, Cameron and Drew were so fun and campy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO.
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,I suppose everyone is here just because of the song...just like me!
RSUq4VfWfjE,You cant see this in Bollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The original idea of Charlie's Angels is 3 smart and beautiful girls fighting crimes with their brains and a bit more physical (in 2000s), and the girls here are nothing fem (forgive me). It feels like it's a Lesbian fighting crime movie (don't get me wrong, i have lesbian friends and I love them). I tried to watch the trailer over and over again but Not feeling it, sry...
""...Just because they can doesn't mean they should...."" so why ???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"An Origin Story and A New Angel in training. I like the tone, light and fun. But weird that isn't using her British Accent. GREAT JOB ELIZABETH :)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was that kristen stewart right ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop remaking remakes.

RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks really bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Low-key Lyesmith!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't post anything negative.....Sony can't handle criticism....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Reaching for a gun always makes a mechanical noise
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella balinska  looks like Abella danger
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a huge Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music in the background is soo misplaced and very distracting
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No,no,no,no, this looks like shot. I loved the old show and the remakes wasn’t that bad... well not this bad anyway"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angels or Charles's angels...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can predict these fucking movies so easily now. This will be terrible and nobody will see it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nope, I refuse.... no!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"crap, pass!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scoots in three remakes back to back.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Resurrecting a dead franchise everyone forgot 5 minutes after it ended for an ultimately pointless cash grab....Sony I like you guys but stick to consoles and spiderman movies ......
RSUq4VfWfjE,And some of one wants bobs and vigana lol 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Vomit from the first dialogue.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bhaiyo like karo guys like for India 💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I also heard Elizabeth Banks catered for the movie as well, but sadly that was cut out of the credits due to time. :("
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like let's just start either the audio.  How gay is the audio honestly . Sounds like some early  2000 movie ... this is why you never let women take a hold of a full movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Indian like my comments and show them from where they are gaining views 😒😋
Indian Youth Power 😍😘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart I love u
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks really really bad

RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't see ari
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me ""man this movie looks like crap skip"" *see Patrick Stewart* ""Shut up and take my money!!!!!!!!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I sure hope Elizabeth banks is in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie can't beat the original one. This is more like Charlie's Angels highschool edition.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait you mean they didn't try to gender swap this franchise to. Nope just ruined it with this crap reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m one of the few that is looking forward to this re-imagination of Charlie’s Angels. Side note, I loved the 2000’s version & Full Throttle"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wrong cast. Wrong dialogue. Wrong plot. Wrong tone.

WRONG WRONG WRONG"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yo unfilm it right now
RSUq4VfWfjE,WOW....!!!! Elizabeth Banks REALLY wants us to know that this movie is ELIZABETH BANKS'S....Hope this doesn't blow up in her face....
RSUq4VfWfjE,There’s no way I’m not calling kristen stewart an angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jane introducing herself to crazy Jane
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Which movie do you definitely don't want to see this year? Damn, right. ""Charlie' Angels by Elizabeth Banks"" from Elizabeth Banks with Elizabeth Banks. Did I mention that Elizabeth Banks is in?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is awesome~ it's no longer the iconic Angel's that we're used to.. but the change is appropriately epic and I love it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another train wreck brought to you by the same sort of people that just know what audiences want.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Elizabeth banks in this by chance? The 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,WE DIDN’T ASK FOR THIS CRAP!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Starring: Elizabeth Banks

RSUq4VfWfjE,I really want Kristen for Catwoman now
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just watched the original Charlie’s angel trailer from 2000 and it’s confirmed.  This one sucks compared to the original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ada Profesor X?

RSUq4VfWfjE,stewart💓💓💓💓
RSUq4VfWfjE,Someone shut down this unit and reactivate that old one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dredging out this movie again?  I don't think people can handle this much intelligence in movie making,  WE need more Super Hero movies.  What genders are these by the way?  I hear there are now 72 so it would help to let people know what genders are in this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why cant people be open minded ??

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think women can do anything



in the kitchen"
RSUq4VfWfjE,That’s horrible casting but I’m pretty sure no one was interested in this type of film ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I Preferred The Original 😍 Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz ❤❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They would make more money if they made this movie into a porno.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I loved Elizabeth Banks back when she was just Miri in ""When Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" (the unrated version, of course)....

Then, all that Hunger Games crap happened..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Enjoy mediocre box office numbers, this looks boring as hell."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who knew kristen stewart had facial expressions !
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s one of those movies where the soundtracks are probably better than the actual movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meanwhile Charles Xavier thinking why I was not permanently dead in X-men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:38 it's not charlie's angels it's totally spies! totally spies like her armpit!😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like a movie you'll see on HBO at 3 o'clock in the morning

RSUq4VfWfjE,Ясно понятно
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant wait 😍

RSUq4VfWfjE,looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is an iMovie credit scene when you’ve done everything
RSUq4VfWfjE,now here is a remake we've all been begging for
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's left to watch in the theater now?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I got bored half way through the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow❤👑👼
RSUq4VfWfjE,Very fresh take to the Charlie's Angels. I'm willing to give this a shot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy, Cameron and Drew will forever be Charlie's angels !!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Some of the worst CGI I've seen. Pause at 2:26 if you want the worst example 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did Elizabeth Banks make  this? I didn’t catch it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really wanted to give this a chance however I just can't I grew up with Cameron, Drew and Lucy ..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why the heck does hollywood keep pumping money into these feminist projects?! Noone wants another Ghostbusters 2016 or Ocean's 8.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm beginning to think Elizabeth Banks has something to do with this movie. Just like I'm beginning to think Batwoman is a woman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a remake  of barbie spy movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,As much as I like some of the reacent reboot and remakes... this is a hard fucking pass and should not have seen the light of day
RSUq4VfWfjE,tired of remakes..........
RSUq4VfWfjE,Couldn't even sit through the three minute trailer not sure I'd make it through the hour or so long movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ENOUGH WITH THE STUPID REMAKES,,,,,,,,,,,,SO STUPID"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so cringy!! Naomi Scott deserves better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So just finish watching that trailer and when is part when they get on their knees start giving blow jobs any man in the scene 🤔

RSUq4VfWfjE,Will Kristen Stewart actually act this time compared to her past movies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Some woman called Elizabeth Banks keeps ringing to ask which bit of the trailer I loved and which bit I loved even more. I've had to put her on block.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please stop remaking/revamping classic movies!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrright...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible generic feminist
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weren't they supposed to be hot? That was the whole premise of the franchise lol

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeeeah..uhm no. I wouldn't watch this even for free
I'm not in the target range of this movie anyway."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please don’t screw this movie as well. 
Also would’ve chosen better actresses."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WHY HAVE I WATCHED THIS FOR LIKE, 25 TIMES!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Peter griffin: except you, you be bosley."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten acting as herself again.... ughh can’t holywood afford better actors?

RSUq4VfWfjE,Wellll... Not bad for women
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thought you would do a gay men version!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay but Kirsten Stewart can step on me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Umm anyone else wandering how Naomi Scott was able to do this and Alddian  at the same time
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ghostbusters, then Men in Black, and now this. Can you stop messing up iconic movies with garbage?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think it's gonna be great too watch something new
Girls full dominated"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where the f is cameron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You mean X's Angels, right?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aladdin's Jasmine turned Charlie's Angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We all know it’s a bit silly, but who cares, let women have movies... how many manly movies don’t we have? Get out of the hate prison your mind is in."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'd rather tie myself naked to a chair and burn myself with lit cigarettes than watch this horror.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disliked just after looking at the thumbnail
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Starring, directed, screenplay, birthed, created, cooked, vomited* by Elizabeth Banks."

RSUq4VfWfjE,This is what happens when feminism takes over hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s a win for the gays
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So... Kristen Stewart is the same Sabina from the SNL Totino's sketch that seduced women?  

I guess it's canon then."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"But, wigs are snatched in the trailer"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Go and watch the trailer for the original 2000 movie if you want to put a smile back on your face... this one looks awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lesbian gang
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Take a worthless show from the 70's, add a generic action plot, gender swap a few characters and call it a day."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only thing missing is Brie Larson to make this Super Feminist Film complete.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks really bad lol Cameron Diaz remake unmatched
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jaysus that looks bad.

Stereotypes from the 1980's was not a question that needed an answer but here we have it anyhow"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella Swan can never play another role... she’ll always be Bella the vampire.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Do, no one is going to talk about Noah?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Atleast its not a reboot.. its just a new generation working for charlie
RSUq4VfWfjE,First words in the trailer set this one up well.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, new kingsmen looks wack"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Oooooooohhhh boooooyyyy........😒...... Movie writers are basically gone from our generation. All we get now is remakes or comic book hero movies. Man i miss the 80s😞.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How do you take a couple of great movies like Charlie’s Angels 1/2 and then go make, Spy Kids the teen years! What a total and utter mess. I feel like I’ll be binge watching the originals tonight, just to rid my eyeballs of this..."

RSUq4VfWfjE,Uneccesary
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drop the soundtrack already
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did they replace the only Asian representation with a black woman ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yup they are devil's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is terrible and so is the music.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really? Lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,bella swan really popped off
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This, Ghostbusters, The Emoji Movie, and MIB 4 were made by the same company that made Spiderverse. They peaked and it's time to shut it all down"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss Cameron and Drew Barrymore 😍😍😍 They were funny .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring!
RSUq4VfWfjE,another epic move they are gonna destroy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Blanks: let’s do a remake.
Everyone else:  0:10"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hotness loaded
RSUq4VfWfjE,noahhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks is to movies as what DJ Khaled is to music...

RSUq4VfWfjE,Love it love it love jt
RSUq4VfWfjE,i love kristian in this Film
RSUq4VfWfjE,Literally none of these girls are likeable except Patrick Stewart but thats always a given.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think they know that this movie will bomb so they brought Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey together to entice there fans to come watch the movie to try and get a ""bigger"" audience."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thisll be such a flop...
RSUq4VfWfjE,You heard here first! This movie is gonna SUCK!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just came to dislike
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry but no one does it better than Drew, Cameron, and Lucy!! 💪🏻✨😇"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This makes them look more intense instead of helpful spies that time out mysteries...this makes them look like straight up killers
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sometimes I hate my YouTube name...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love it when they show the whole movie in the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,drew barrymore will always remain my Angel..❤❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Building a movie around Kristin Stewart who has the emotional range of a pea was one of many bad decisions for this reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 💞💞💞💞
RSUq4VfWfjE,No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thats the Alladin girl.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The cringe is real omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,Do we think Kristen Stewart got the name Sabina from the SNL Totinos sketch?
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least it seems to not be worse than the song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are people hating on this?This looks amazing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,🐕 💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,I Like charlies angels 2000 that one was Wow..and i watch that trailer again & again..
RSUq4VfWfjE,All these movie executives who keep giving us remakes need to be fired.  Please fire them.  PLEASE!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just here to dislike this pile of trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,THAT WAS AMAZINGGGG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony must be using a cheat code to stop the thumbs down!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think the choices on actresses in this movie weren't so fit to represent the Charlie's Angels image, they looked shallow to profounding the roles of the characters, i mean they still looked like showing their original traits, and the chemistry between the angels itself were also looked plain, not deep. I still prefer the 2000 version."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"New Hollywood Employment Scheme:
Are you not getting acting jobs?
Become a director, easy as that"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels...

RSUq4VfWfjE,"hey instead of remaking every movie unnecessarily how bout creating original film
why don't you make an all male one while you're at it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A new trailer for the highly anticipated, ORIGINAL Tarantino movie ‘Once upon a time in Hollywood’ has about half as many views as this but only 1/7th as many likes? And every comment here is negative? Something fishy is going on here..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay, this is way getting out of hand, WHY TF IS NOAH CENTINEO IN A MOVIE DIRECTED BY ELIZABETH BANKS?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah nah nah nobody ask for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ang probinsyano presents cardo's angels 😅😅😅😅😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,We all know in the real world these women would get destroyed
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think *WE'RE ALL* here for the Soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,This sucks big time with that music or without it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah Charlie’s angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Liked for one and only cool KRISTEN STEWART

RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine leave her castle
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please dub in hindi 😀 nice trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remake, reboot, relaunch, change actors, flip genders, flip the middle finger to our viewers. When will hollywood make genuine movies again?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's a no from me, Drew, Lucy, and Cameron is and always will be the best. Can't wait to not watch it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eeeewwwwwww
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll be happy to watch on Netflix
RSUq4VfWfjE,Do they just keep redoing every movie every few years?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wack

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart..... in Charlie’s Angels... 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is soooooooooo girls movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like it's woke material
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is Charlie not a girl? Toxic masculinity?
And ofcourse he is enjoying white privilege 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ik it sounds like I'm hating but.... this is disgusting
RSUq4VfWfjE,"when kristen stewart become miley cyrus
when princess jasmine become spy
When Profesor X Still Profesor X
😅🤣😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trailer sucks I hope. Movie is gonna sucks too cause I like original Charlie's angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’d rather watch a Bollywood reboot of Charlie’s angels than this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:01 Elizabeth Banks, 1:01 Elizabeth Banks, 2:16 Elizabeth Banks, 2:40 Elizabeth Banks, Elizabeth Banks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn this movie looks horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just because you can making another Charles angels doesn’t mean you should
RSUq4VfWfjE,After MIB sony should stop making remakes movie! It sucks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,That dislike to like ratio says it all
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So twilight girl, pink power, Charles Xavier, random Netflix dude

RSUq4VfWfjE,NOOOOO! no no no no .I MISS YOU LUCY LU.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The trailer and movie could have been worst. They could had made an all-male cast remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thanks I hate it!
2000s Charlie’s Angel was a masterpiece and can’t be topped"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cannot wait for this. So empowering for women
RSUq4VfWfjE,twilight girl is lesbian
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are we not gonna mention the power rangers and X-Men crossover here
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I LOVE kristen stewart but damn, she deserves better movies than this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,feels like totally spies except the characters..
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,For the first time I wasn't bored to watch miss Kristen Stewart on screen lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look princess Jasmine is in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott slays shes in a band in lemonade mouth, she's a power ranger, a princess, and now she's a part of Charlie's angels she SLAYSSSSSSS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jesus this looks like shite!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer editor:   Hey Elizabeth, how many times do you want your name to appear in the trailer? 

Elizabeth Banks: Yes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No. 1 Bullshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is in this ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here for Naomi Scott!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,no thanks she ruined pitch perfect
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stay in the kitchen honey.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Christen Stevrt
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Song Title: ""Don't call me Angel...""
Claudia Tripp: Oh..now you see me.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Went to the prescreening. Entertaining for 15 year old kids
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a hard time believing Charlie survived the Thanos snap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Triples power
RSUq4VfWfjE,Duuuuumb Cameron Diaz’s is better
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Liked the original 70’s tv show & loved 2000’s remake, but this is a hard pass for me!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,How can you judge something before it has even come out?You all need to chill out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:34 Jordan B Peterson
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hit like for kristen stewart ❤❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think this looks boring compared to early 2000s Charlie's Angels movie. Its missing the over exaggerated femininity, that's what made it fun lol."
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO.
RSUq4VfWfjE,You have so many talents but acting is not one of them.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This makes my heart happy. The future is female! ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,who watch this in india
RSUq4VfWfjE,"there was no fun in the trailer, charlies angels is suppose to be cute fun and badass i feel like they tried to make it fun tho 1🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is no one going to acknowledge the fact that Noah centineo is literally in almost every movie these days😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Just because they can, doesn't mean they should""
Spot on."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m so disappointed like they might be trying to be all modern with the angels but they don’t act nor dress like the originals Charlie’s angles who are meant to be the rich looking sexy (not that they aren’t) badass feminine gang i just think that if they are gonna make a movie after another movie they shouldn’t change the most important characteristics about it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did anyone else see this on ariana grandes post?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Could they make it more sjw
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't feel ""the wow factors"" from the new angels. The trailer also looks bland and cliche. I hope it would be better when the movie is out."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me or Kristen Stewart gets all the spotlight
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i think people are disliking because they are comparing it with original movie and cast, i kind of like it but surely didn't love it, for the same reason."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please noooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,This screams WoMen POwEr
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a Britney Spears music video
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that princess jasmine....
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many movies about 100lb skinny bitches easily beating up everyone and everything are going to come out this year? How many shitty reboots must we endure?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay but I love this
RSUq4VfWfjE,One more box office flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Incase u missed this is by Elizabeth Banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah Kristen awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I'm in love with these girls.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I just wasted 3 min of my life
RSUq4VfWfjE,Initialising lesbian crush on Kristan Stewart. Ohmigodidontthinkimreadyforthismoviehahaok
RSUq4VfWfjE,KingsWomen
RSUq4VfWfjE,So the Charlie is X-MEN Charlie 😆😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:34 4x scope!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Guy with the accent: doesn’t want her to touch the explosive mint shits but literally smacks it down to the floor
RSUq4VfWfjE,"can we talk about the song with Cat valentine, Hannah Montana, & Lana del Ray?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"At least the old reboot had 3 likable actresses that were fun and beloved. This cast is nothing but Patrick Stewart, Shovel Face, ELIZABETH BANKS EVERYONE, the one guy from Guardians of the Galaxy, and some people who would work for cheap. 

Must've spent all their money on the soundtrack."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"the black one is too tall, is too distracting"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is the definitly turning point it naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2019 is definitely Naomi Scott's year, from Aladdin to Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,👊👊kristen your very 💪strong😁😁😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will watch this for Naomi Scott.. and maybe Noah. Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now just waiting for this movie....
Superb+ awesome trailer ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie bought to u by forever 21 - grace Randolph
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry but i'm tired of films being more diverse on paper than visually. Lets be blatant: there isn't much difference between the skin tones!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,LMFAO girl power bullshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still preferred the 00s version.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im gonna watch this because i didn't watch the old one.
Edit: and I love Kristen and noah"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks: Full Throttle
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,After the movie flops the producers will blame misogyny.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok while everyone else complaining I'mma be right there in the movies with my popcorn
RSUq4VfWfjE,Amazed they didnt make em to all boys
RSUq4VfWfjE,You gotta be kidding me...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks and Naomi Scott are both Looking to move on from that Power Rangers debacle, sadly for them SJWs and feminists are about to blast this film for being misogynistic  unless they turn Charlie into a transvestite or a lesbian ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Bosley a woman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,dumb as the last one
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's gonna suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,YES
RSUq4VfWfjE,The old one way better
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this even allowed
RSUq4VfWfjE,older movie was nice not this one..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood's creativity is apparently on life support. This did not need a reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage Alert! Garbage Alert! Garbage Alert! The sad part about these movies is their originals will always out do them.
RSUq4VfWfjE,not gonna lie........im liking how the twilight girl is looking now.... she can get it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female kings man Lul
RSUq4VfWfjE,Abbe it looks a bit like FF
RSUq4VfWfjE,This film is a continuation of the franchise that references back to the 2000’s angels and the 70’s angels. This is an ORIGINAL film because it isn’t a reboot of the past. You can watch billions of Spider-Man Films but it’s different with Charlies Angels? ignorant.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it kingsWomen
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked the original cast better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watching remakes is like getting a lobotomy. Lost too many brain cells just from the trailer.

I hope SP goes bankrupt with their trashy remake of remakes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,When I first saw the commercials I felt like Kristen Stewart would ruin this movie. I still think it 😬
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG people chill.......I don't think it's going to be a bad movie and Kirsten Stewart kind looks boss af in this😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't judge a boy by his cover!!!
🤔🤔...........

RSUq4VfWfjE,dangerous angels😉😉😉
RSUq4VfWfjE,👎👎👎👎👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yall could never be drew, Lucy lu, and Cameron Diaz. Like Beyoncé said"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Release in hindi also
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eh...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously, who let these women out of the kitchen?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Even the theme song is :""Don't call me an angel""
Well we are not going to😄😄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,We need old characters these are boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony 
Failure is a choice"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer songs mix from
1: Janelle Monáe – Make Me Feel(2018)
2: Don't call me Angel- Miley, Ariana & Lana (Yet to Release)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mirrey javi noble !❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Feminist haircut automatically gets dislikes and puts off many potential viewers.... So why do it? 





“BECAUSE THIS MOVIE WASNT MADE FOR YOU, IT WAS MADE FOR INDEPENDENT WAWMAN”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wonder who directed this ?_?
RSUq4VfWfjE,another Spice Girls movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to watch this movie..my fav kristen is here...plz let me know how can i watch movie in India
RSUq4VfWfjE,there's no asian :( i mean technically princess jazmine is asian but i mean LUCY LIU THOUGH let's not kid ourselves.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why does it feel like this one’s gonna suck? Oh right, Noah Centemayo is here."
RSUq4VfWfjE,KSTEW is HOT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this totally spies the movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, they really stepped up Charlie’s Angels. Who else watched the original series lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Let me guess, all the villains are striaght white men!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Noah Centiwhatever is gonna be in there..... Not surprised
I'll give it a chance and hope it isn't another unnecessary remake (im looking forward to the songs by miley, lana and ariana too so that's that)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh ruining another classic by making them all women. Oh wait...
RSUq4VfWfjE,STOP JUST STOP all these remakes!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I prefer the originals by far. No, not the 2000 movie, I'm talking about the series from the 70s. In the originals, the angels seem more genuine.  Im not a fan of the modernisation with the bad music, ""modern"" culture, the makeup, the clothing, but i understand it was done to appeal to a newer audience, (of whom I'm not going to spend time describing.) 

It might be an ""alright"" movie, but the original series will always be at the top."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"NO ONE:
SONY: HERE
ME:NO THANKS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What happen to Hollywood???
RSUq4VfWfjE,When are we gonna see a male version? 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks so exciting. I can't wait!

Seems like everyone else can tho lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,nobody ask for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just nothing left in Hollywood...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella e Jasmine MINHA MENTE EXPLODIU MUITO  🔥❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bring Back The Old Actor .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay I'm intrigued. The British girl is hot!
RSUq4VfWfjE,In movies we see feminism prpoganda of Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmm I don’t know about this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,poor Patrick Stewart whats he doing in this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess I'll go see it for Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah I'll past...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, is Elizabeth Banks in this movie??? I'm not quite sure."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Brie larson should be in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:37 under arm, yaak🤮🤮🤮🤮"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like i just watched the whole entire movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really don't care who gets offended by what I have to say, because personally I'm offended by this movie. I hate it, it's trash and Kristen Stewart can barely act.  You made Bosely a women? I really hope Charley was left alone. Look, as a women I appreciate the head nod towards feminism but is it just me or does this whole GO GIRLS thing seem to be extra to the point it beats you over the head with a bat? Not only that but recently I've noticed only remakes of my cherished shows/movies and not a single one was worthy of praise. Have we run out of ideas so soon? Leave the shows alone and create something new this is embarrassing. And for any offended individuals note that I personally think this was targeted towards me the audience. Women who watched and loved charles angels, i mean just look at the description, it shouts feminism. My last thought is this okay, EVERYONE please if you are going to create a movie filled with positivity and politics and blah can we be a little more subtle? Can we show women being independent and not say it in the script? Can we get girls with different attitudes DANG shy girls who are housewives who still show feminism? I'm just saying. I know my opinion on feminism is unimportant and my views on the movie irrelevant but I can't be the only one tired of this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was that Elizabeth Banks? I wasn’t sure 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,disgusting!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The gay energy radiating from this is absurd
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watching trailer only for Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll watch it. The girls are pretty badass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't care what everyone is saying about how shitty this will be. Kristen Stewart's hair is worth seeing it just once AND Patrick Stewart is in it..so yeah, just one time. Come on! I know, I'm vapid. U don't need to comment lol. 💙💜💛💚"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally TTS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hindi me release please
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why this in my recommend
RSUq4VfWfjE,We miss you old angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did anyone notice the 2 costumes that were used back in the 2003 movie in 1:45? Cause i miss it!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow they really wamted to give a gift to the lesbians and the bis...

I, as a bi woman myself, feel very blessed!

Edit: I'm a fucking idiot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They almost make Christen steward unknown
RSUq4VfWfjE,They paid homage to the early 00s film by featuring Diaz/Barrymore/Lui’s old costumes in the closet! It’s quick but they’re there...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I would absolutely LOVE another remake of Charlie's Angels, starring no-name actresses!!!!




SAID NO ONE .....EVER!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh what a shallow production and waste of time and money.

Pathetic studio machine catering to the lowest common denominator."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is so gonna be panned by critics... and sadly will bomb at the box office. Not sending bad vibes, just telling the obvious."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's remake Charlie's Angel's but make it far worse. Barely an inconvenience
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart = Very Common
RSUq4VfWfjE,Asian out
RSUq4VfWfjE,no thx
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey, remember the original Charlie's Angles who were three under-appreciated cops who used their brains to solve crimes? Now they're all action heroes/teenage boys sex fantasies. It's hard to believe that the 1970's was more progressive in the presentation of women in the media than in 2019."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Angry Video Game Nerd will not be happy about this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trending at 11 in India
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Bosley is not a guy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie only exist to show that woman are capable to do anything instead of man. I hated that kind of movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringiest Movie of the Year goes to....
RSUq4VfWfjE,😫😢😭😩😭😩😩😩😩😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,🧔🏻Dj Khaleed: Another one?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"At least they are not virtue signalling their asses off, after batwahman this doesn't look so bad"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's weird seeing Kristen Steward smile for once... She looks completely different.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ehhh idk maybe they should call it something else but i like Kirsten so i’ll watch it whenever it hits netflix and wtf was that terrible music i feel like Bosley should’ve stayed a man Hollywood over doing now as u can see with the female batman they have now
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope the movie isn't as cheesy as the music and trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why has no one mentioned that Noah Centineo appears in here? Seriously I'm bored of this guy, he is everywhere"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie looks ok. AMC A-list will come in handy for this.
Kristen Stewart is so 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It'd be so much better if they didn't have to wear those humiliating outfits. I mean is this for women or men to look at women's bodies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I could've used a little bit more Elizabeth banks I dont feel like they showed enough of her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music mash up for this trailer is awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,The movie no body asked for.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm 12 and still love Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song slaps tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks better than I expected.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,That opening line he says is the understatement of Hollywood today! 😡
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gross.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie will not replace Drew, Lucy and Cameron.  It feels so......remade....in a cheap sort of way."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I Love Charlie's Angles.. 😍
I hope Little Mix have a single from this movie cuz they defenitly girl power... 😩💪"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeahhhh looks like garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,In general...I wonder why they keep making remakes or sequels are movie producer running out of ideas.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyone needs to remember that Lucy Cameron and Drew aren't the original Charlie's angels either
RSUq4VfWfjE,Asca
RSUq4VfWfjE,Release the song!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thought that was Naomi Harris for a second at the beginning lol (28 days later, Bond's new Moneypenny). Lowkey one of the best childhood crushes I've ever had. Can't wait for the next bond movie though I guess. I think I'll like this too probably."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not a personality to be found between the three of them.
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please stop remaking things that no one wants to be remade. This is trash, just another film where you are forcing femininity into our faces"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Same old story
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look! It's Princess Jasmine and Snow White in one movie. 😂❣️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies Angles but make it for teeny boppers. Was that Djimon Hounsou? Nice!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aren't Charlie's angles supposed to look beautiful?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll take that as a no. Reboot Charlie's angels to those 3 are a color than the better nostalgia of Charlie's angels. The 70s well, my parents know the tv series but they're look better without the mix up color. And the 2000s dont look bad at all but they were better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,If you are going to remake something be fresh and do something new. This looks like girly kingsmen but not funny or charming. The song sucks. The action is slow and played out. Is this the best they can do?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony: we will give you a remake of something you don't even want.....Guaranteed flop!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a feeling that Naomi Scott's character is really a traitor because of what happened in the original  film with Sam Rockwell's character who played the victim but really set them up.  that's mostly what's going to what's going to happen here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow this looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,YESS
RSUq4VfWfjE,so is this a live action version of the cartoon totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I'm going to send them an invoice for my time spent agonizing during this trailer. Hard pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does Garrett Watts know about this?????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay so the new Charlie's Angeles are A Monotone Kristen Stewart, Some Ditzy Brunette and A Daria Wannabe.......This looks so AMAZING *emphasis on Amazing*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can Kristen talk without blinking every word in this trailer?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart??? wat a joke!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok right wing NCPs. I want you guys to please explain to me how a film with attractive women, minority bad guys, guns and women acting like women is feminist propaganda"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll take the last remake, with Drew Barrymore........u all can keep this shyte!! Watch it utterly BOMB!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That's it, nothing is original anymore.


Wouldn't it be ok if you just let things die sony?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s already got bad reviews on rotten tomatoes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They gave away the whole story in the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:53 All I saw is the 'AUG'. Pubg Love❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Guys is Kristen Stewart smile and laugh WTF it's happening to this world???
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks like a SJW version. no thanks..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I’m gonna pass on this one.... Just saying
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, this isn't going to fly......it looks like it will suck."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is so powerful with long blonde hair 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg omg omg 😲😲
RSUq4VfWfjE,We miss Kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,期待，好看
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will Kristen Stewart be sleeping with the director again?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the black queen from ? Wow she looks amazing n badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sorry but kristen Stewart is a terrible actress. She just tries so hard to be intense that its laughable. I feel like I'm watching her play the same character in every film shes in.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm gonna go ahead and guess one of them is probably a lesbian.
RSUq4VfWfjE,People still criticize Kristen Stewart as if she only had one movie. Have you all seen Personal Shopper? Her tits were amazing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When an all male team movie was being remake the gender change but if an all female team was being remake the gender didn't change. Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,what they didn't do a guys version?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's high time for an all-male remake of this show. Come on people, it's time for empowerment and equality and that goes both ways! Who is with me??? 😆"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i just realized totally spies was basically charlie's angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's hilarious to me how people, mostly men, call everything staring women feminist propaganda. And by hilarious I mean pathetic 🙄."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks hot in this haircut tho🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,2000's angels was the best one. Change my mind.
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOMBA
RSUq4VfWfjE,Plz follow my Instagram account mritunjay 6753 I will definitely follow you back
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible. Worst cast omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So does Elizabeth Banks has anything to do with the movie?? I can't figure out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course they have a lesbian and a black chick
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for this box office bomb👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s a CONTINUATION NOT A REMAKE OR A REBOOT sick of seeing those comments 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So it's James Bond, Mission Impossible with women. No real acting -  if it moves, kick it, punch it or blow it up. Yawn."
RSUq4VfWfjE,“Handsome“ nerd
RSUq4VfWfjE,those characters supposed to be that uncharismatic? like wow naomi is just soo impressed about the whole thing
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's like a competition to see who can make the worst movie trailer of 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just terrible looking.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feels like they are copying the reboot of charmed.....help us all
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Comparing the likes to the comments......I scrolled through all the comments (yes, all 9.9k at the time of posting this, took forever) and not a single damn comment is remotely positive about the damn trailer. What the hell is going on here?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please don't, just don't."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"- Women are better than men theme for the umteenth time, 
- Cliché dialogue,
- Unfunny one liners,
- Over reliance on action,
- One protagonist falls in love,
- Car product placement,
- Add nothing original,
- Made to sell a pop song, 

Yep, bad reboot is a go people, bad reboot is a go."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who’s asking for Charlie angels crap!!? Gawd!!!!!

I can smell the stench of pc liberal propaganda smh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a horrible trailer?!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART IS UGLY
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Editor: How much of the movie we you want me to cut for the trailer

Director: yes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hard pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's with the fuss? The old one is more cheesy
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so excited for Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Whole American is under the panty of woman, I mean just see how feminisms overruling them.... just see a girl is beating a man with great comfort"
RSUq4VfWfjE,If Captain Picard is in the movie he needs his name mentioned before any of the rest of the cast ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah...😍😍😍,Totally Spies Live action movie💗💗💗.
I'm so happy☺"
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY???; NOW I have lived long enough to see a reboot of a reboot of a franchise ;sheesh!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I Really Don't know why but this movie looks so BORING!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"TL;DR: ""Strong woman"" beats up Andrew Yang and looks like she's recently undergone chemotherapy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jesus....this is just....man. glad everyone already got paid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a Jimmy Kimmel spoof
RSUq4VfWfjE,A wig reveal. RuPaul is quaking
RSUq4VfWfjE,"mixed feelings; they look so young, like watching kids"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood: Hey do you guys want a Charlie’s Angels sequel??

Literally everyone: 

Hollywood: IN THEATERS NOVEMBER"
RSUq4VfWfjE,We here to help
RSUq4VfWfjE,THE ANGELS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DETECTIVES NOT LIKE TOTALLY SPIES! THEY DON'T NEED HIGH-TECH GADGETS JUST FOR WHAT? TO IMPRESSED PEOPLE ESPECIALLY MENS?! LMAO!! SMH!! 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No new ideas, that's why China are taking over."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Do we really need another one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Kristen Stewart is back
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss cameron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not cheesy enough and too much pandering
RSUq4VfWfjE,REMAKES AFTER REMAKES AFTER REMAKES🤦🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let’s copy every spy movie ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame

RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Short Haired Kristen Stewart ❤❤❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Charless Xavier team up with Bella and Princess Jasmin 😋😆 Cool.!!! 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else remember that Kirsten Stewart was sabene in that Torino’s SNL skit and is Sabena in this? Coincidence I THINK NOT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop
RSUq4VfWfjE,brooooooooooooo Kristen Stewart and NOAH CENTINEO in my fav moviiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who idea was it to do this again 🙄🙄🙄🙄 we had some greats in the original movie 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ I’ll pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,thanks i hate it
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is so unnecessary...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yes on Elizabeth Banks! Making Bosley a woman is genius- Meh on the casting for the angels... it wasn’t as great as Drew,Lucy and Cameron who in my opinion were far better than the original cast too..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't know. I'm on the fence. I'm going to probably watch for all the hot ppl.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm actually excited for the singles.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"More like ""Janes Bond"" than Charlies Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,RIP BERNIE MAC
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sigh ruining anothe great movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:53 THATS AUG!!!!! 


any pubg lovers?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's make this politically correct. Check list of Hollywood buzzwords and SJW crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,So here's an idea don't reboot films that were ABSOLUTELY CLASSICS. You can't top them have you not learned.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More of like a Totally Spies vibe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks dumb
RSUq4VfWfjE,"More politically correct drivel,  for mindless young girls to eat up 👎🏻"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Who should we bring in to play Bosley?""
""A Woman!""
""Wouldn't that be a little confusing?""
""A Woman!""
???...............""that's all you can say, isn't it""
""A Woman!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They remake to this movie is already in the makes and set to be released on 2022 staring Neil Patrick Harris, Zachary Quinto and Ricky Martin."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:

Youtube: Check out the new Carlie’s Angels Trailer"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only thing why  I'm going to watch the movie, noah centineo"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Next level stupid.  Can you say 'box office poison?'
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew lucy and cameron are not that old and they can still act...give em a call...ijs
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*GHOSTBUSTER MAKING BY GIRLS: FAIL , MIB INTERNATIONAL FULL FEMINIST: FAIL , CHARLIE ANGELS: FEMINIST AND MULTICULTURALISM,POLITICALLY CORRECT: FAIL , SONY LOVE LOST MONEY*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks, wrote, directed and acted on this, making this trailer really about HER becoming a director and taking a role traditionally played by men... Oh and that Kristen Stuart hasn't changed since she was on Twilight."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it just me? I miss Bill ""Fucking"" Murry"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was really excited about the movie but idk, this is a bad taste.
I didn't understand the sequence of the trailer"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course you can't have a man telling them telling women what to do.😒 Name doesn't even make sense on her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wasn’t this one of them super bad GameCube games? (Playstation included)
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't care about the movie but let me just inform you that the entire Tumblr is being gay and breakdancing for this especially Kristen Stewart(that includes me)
RSUq4VfWfjE,You all complain and yet I bet you go see this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh so this is what happened to Bella Cullen 😝
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Elizabeth Banks but sorry I am going to skip this one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,well I already know all the plot beats...
RSUq4VfWfjE,And here's for a new flopper movie! Horay!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am number 6
RSUq4VfWfjE,"sony: we  are going to erase the mess of the last charlie's angels remake

RSUq4VfWfjE,"The new song by Miley, Ari, and Lana is my FAVORITE ALREADY!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Que clase de Basura es esto

RSUq4VfWfjE,They can use guns now?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously? Another damn reboot smh just make new movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer music is awful. Movie looks 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look ANOTHER remake! 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought that was Liza Koshy in the thumbnail LMAO
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok. What is up woth the comments about being a remake? If most of you have read the internet, Banks actually said this isn't remake... Its a Continuation of the Previous Charlie's Angels Films and tv shows!

Am Excited for damn thing btw... Can't freakin Wait! 
I love u Naomi! 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only person I'm excited to see in this movie is Kristen Stewart... that's saying a lot huh?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They follow * with the politically correct *, when you understand Sony, you like to be throwing your money in crap."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"charlize theron, and Danai in this film it would look even better"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whats charlies angels without destiny's child? smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well done.. 👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,Djimon Hounsou though🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,what year is it? this is why Christopher Lee was crying
RSUq4VfWfjE,pass....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trrrrassssshs
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't come up with any new ideas so just keep remaking movies! 🙄🙄🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a fking train wreck with Kristan Stewart and Ariana Grande
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay but Kirsten Stewart’s character *realllyyyy* suits her though; reminds me of Dylan
RSUq4VfWfjE,Justin Bieber big screen debut
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wahhh...they're all women. How sexist. Wah. Why can't a man be an Angel? Wah. (JK. No one who matters cares.)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Roadside Romeo enter the chat
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else think that Kristen with the wig looks a lot like that Buzzfeed girl Kelsey?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who cares about the song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie looks so cringe it made me involuntarily shart my in my tights.

There’s nothing more repulsive than a brainwashed female trying to portray a masculine energy, pulling an angry face and head butting people 🤮

Women are always trying so hard to be like men. It’s so sad. The delicate beauty of a woman is what’s so damn adorable and attractive and loveable. They make the world and infinitely better place.

But when they try to act like men it’s sickening and makes me wish I was gay."
RSUq4VfWfjE,2000 Angel girls more hotter ? Or not?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why arent we getting an all male charlies angels cast, you know like ghostbusters"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""the feminists are taking over""😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,When I seen Kristen Stewart I lost all interest
RSUq4VfWfjE,There’s no way you can convince me that Noah Centineo could be a nerd. Ever.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,The girl from twilight isn't fit enough.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Interesting trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,B O R I N G
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Producer: How can we make the Charlie's Angels Movie B O R I N G?
Director: Yes?
Cast: Yes?

PS: THE CAST AREN'T SELLING FOR ME. A FLOP."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why’s every body complaining? Trailer seemed fine to me. Y’all judging a whole movie before even watching it.🤦🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*This movie will bomb,  I can already see it's going to be like a 747 crashing nose dive first.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This comments section will give the studio and producers agitated days and sleepless nights until November🤣🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron Diaz, and Lucy liu ain't even up to 50 and you've already got a remake for their movie. Common."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey does anyone know if Elizabeth Banks was involved in this in any way?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Guys dont judge a girl by her cover am i right everybody am i everyone!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:07 does this guy only sign up for bad movies where he is the love interest of a main character
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yuck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood fixed its diversity issues and replaced it with Originality issues.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lesbian Kristen Stewart seems bitchy compared to her younger, innocent self."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen fans
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart can’t move that fast, she’s a lazy smoker."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I think women can do anything"" sure...in the movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hassenao
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay!  We will be seeing ""Charlie's Angels!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lost me at Kristin Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bad casting what the Aladdins girl doing there? 
And with all the dance it’s an indian movie? 😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell no Kristen should not be in here at all its like ever since she beat up jacob for in printed on her daughter i lost all interest in her acting career
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg again? How original!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why doesn't Hollywood understand that we don't like women Ghostbusters didn't work so why would this work
RSUq4VfWfjE,Beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,This comment section is terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,That damn song crushed any tension or comedy out of the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The future is... 'tarded
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Say hi again to Bella Swan from Twilight and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. Also, Peter Kavinsky from To All The Boys I Loved Before."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just laugh and shake my head when a movie shows girls beating up men. That only happens in Hollywood where everything is fake. Because in real life it's just not a thing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The depressing thing is that I bet this film will make loads of money!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I always wonder if directors or producers who make these remakes actually watched the original movies and understood and saw wat made those movies great
RSUq4VfWfjE,yall i know this is another remake but it still looks like a fun time. can't wait to see it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y’all didn’t have to do this yanno
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They should've just done Charlie's Devil's and cast men to play the part, lol. I'll stick with the previous remakes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They're really milking the hell out of this new single if it's being shoved twice in a trailer for a movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked Aladdin
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok didn't wait until the end
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wouldn't waste my time
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wheres Charley?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They illuminati'd out Charly's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too bad chicks don't actually kick dudes' asses like that in real life.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie looks awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love Elizabeth but I’m skipping this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Maybe this fire actor line up may save movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont care what everyone is saying i am actually excited to see this movie 😂😍😍😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie looks really bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is 2:53 too long. Terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Off the charts satanic!!!!  Any Christian who is going to see this movie News Flash Repent!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well no point on wasting money 😆.. they just showed the whole film 😂😂😂. . .
RSUq4VfWfjE,K stew still boring AF 🙄🙄🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,When the  first song contradicts the premise you’re already bad and you should feel bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,So bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How can Director be a writer and actor as the same time? What a talent, Elizabeth. 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This’s a disrespect for the already disrespected OG movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks horribly bad, my soul herts, couldn't pay me to watch, rather watch my spleen get removed. F+ ohhhh i even puked a little, must be mytoxicmasculinity🙊"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't remember a black angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll only watch if Kristen Stewart uses her strap on the other girls
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kraft Mac n' cheese no longer the cheesiest
RSUq4VfWfjE,"is this meant to be a continuation of the original? also no ate, but the trailer is soo boring"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sjw haircut.   Next.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That music is terrible it annoys the hell out of me I was trying to watch the trailer but I kept hearing that music 🤨
RSUq4VfWfjE,That movie looks boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What are they gonna do, accuse them of sexual assault?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a flop Honestly
RSUq4VfWfjE,On the brightside. Its not batwoman (cw) or oceansvagina.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I actually really liked it lol 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL
Hollywood knows it, thats why they arent putting in any effort anymore they know its all going to be over soon why even try.but all jokes aside how else can you explain a city full of unique writers, actors/comedians writing original scripts, and writers from all around the world flooding the inboxes of Hollywood with new and original scripts. but only these bull-crap rehashes get the Green Light. like i know Hollywood is just big boy money laundering for the investors. but do they really just sit some guy down in a room and tell him to pick out the easiest thing to reboot. so the investment firm can gather dirty money and spend $100 million on a movie and hope to get back $250 million in clean/legit money because make no mistake a Charlie angels movie will gross at least $100 million if Ghostbusters reboot did $240 million about the same numbers as Charlies angels 2000)


you turned our precious art into a simple equation and we can feel/see/notice it please stop or just slow down take a brake. only do reboots on leap years or something"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Producer- How will we make this movie go BOOM?

Actors-




aRiAnA GrAnDe"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m only going to see it because Professor X, Rita Repulsa, and the Pink Ranger are in it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't get me wrong not as bad looking as I thought it would be, still quite bad looking but I thought it was gonna look a lot worse. But seriously though you make a trailer for Charlie's Angels and the song you decide to go with is a song where the main lyric is ""Don't call me Angel""? Might just be me but that doesn't really make sense especially when in the trailer the ""Angels"" respond positively to being called Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to see Abella Danger's new film 😍🤤🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart's acting looks great she seems funny in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love how this looks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shitty kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do those 3 girls remind me of that tv show “Totally Spies” lol!
RSUq4VfWfjE,F E M I N I S M= DISLIKE
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I remembered when for the first time Aladdin's trailer came out, the comment section was full of disappointment but the movie was priceless.I feel the same for this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So basically Charlie's Angels is a terrorist organisation but ""girl power wins I guess"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m sorry.  I’m getting weary of Hollywood girl power.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m seeing a lot of hate comments am I the only who really wants to see this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ewww. I am going to pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aint nobody gonna watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like an over the top mess
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie from X-Men ?????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels has all the social tropes of today which is fantastic!




1.) Lezboi Lesbo 
2.) Alpha Lesbo
3.) Lipstick Lesbo"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is the worst actress in the world.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one excited here 🥺🥺🥺👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
RSUq4VfWfjE,How are they gonna replace those 3 great actresses with these no name bad actresses... People eat up all of it anyway
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks so boring, sorry but i won't be watching this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ve never felt more gay🏳️‍🌈🌈
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y otra vez vuelven con sus reboots culeros como el de Cazafantasmas 😒😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,The female version of kimgsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bela please back in twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Make something original pleaseeeee. No one asked for this garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate when they remake movies and stick new shitty pop music in them.
RSUq4VfWfjE,love the cast...a reboot tho? i mean i'm still not over the first one yet
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah  nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i loved the original and how funny it was, the ladies knew how to use their sex appeal so well, still remember that poor limo driver XD"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What Charles Xavier does in his free time lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I know ppl are annoyed with this but like it’s nice to see Kristen Stewart have some fun for once tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ain't gonna waste my money on this bullshit.
RSUq4VfWfjE,😊🎂😉🎂😉😗😉
RSUq4VfWfjE,Throw it away please
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate everything about it...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Actually idc about the movie i want the song 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should be called Charlie's Bitches , never seen women do so much for a man."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott is the main reason I'll even bother watching this in theaters with my AMC A-List membership. There's no way in hell this movie will be great. Look at M.I.B. International..... (-__-).


P.s. I find it interesting that the world population gave more money to Alita: Battle Angel than Shazam (which I enjoyed both)."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart is the best part of this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why did NO ONE mention NOAH CENTINEO at 2:05 ?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Throw this away, please"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Unfortunately it doesn't have The Chad in it, so i don't think this will do better then the previous movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jesus hell yea
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is this abomination?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be bad I feel it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man I’m sick of these remakes. I loved the Charlie’s Angels movie with Drew, Cameron, and Lucy. They just running out of ideas and keep doing remakes🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angel in 2019 = The powerpuff girls in 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,My first clue that this movie is gonna be mediocre...Elizabeth Banks as “Bosley” *le sigh*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana grande voice is way too oxygenated !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,bring back the original cast and the og theme song... and u can have all the money u want...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angels has been done before!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg Kristen with long blonde hair😍😍😘😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everybody complaining that its a reboot and saying the one in the early 2000s was the OG Charles angels forget that was a reboot too...🤦‍♀️  I want someone to name any of the original charles angels with out looking it up bet you can't
RSUq4VfWfjE,a remake I definitely won't watch 😜
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the F*?????  No!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A movie with female protagonists, and it's not pushing woman empowerment?

*WHAT KIND OF MADNESS IS THIS!?*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow......... red box
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t own a DVD player, so guess I won’t be able to see this straight-to-DVD version of Charlie’s Angels. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm gonna watch it but it looks like bad acting. Looks stupid and the actresses don't suit the roles. I'll still watch it though.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeeeeaaah I'm still gonna watch it though
RSUq4VfWfjE,Twiharder garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I mean SONY is having a lot of hits so I’m not going to be surprised when this movie makes that money.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is there any need to watch the movie after this? It's basically shown the beginning, middle and end"
RSUq4VfWfjE,When does the song come out???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""they showed the whole movie in the trailer""

but you saw the original tho."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can anyone say : ghost busters, captain America, Batwoman crap."
RSUq4VfWfjE,terrible.......
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why didnt they just leave it alone..?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie gonna suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Those Are DEFINITELY NOT Charlie's Angels...😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not having sex appeal on notoriously sexy real life people and fictional characters would blow up badly. In other words with the aid of my neckbeard: get woke go broke.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Periodt
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No, thanks. Keeping drew, cameron and lucy. 😉"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why whenever they cast a lead black woman, always a light skin girl?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So basically fast of the furious
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can we give a franchise a minute before we reboot it?
Dayyuummm!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am i the only one actually super excited about this the original was amazing yes that doesnt mean this cant be something very entertaining as well im here for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ok at first I watch this because of Kristen Stewart.
but then ok let""s try to watch this eventhough for me the original is still the best."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Welcome back ladies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Abella Danger look a like
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:00 I'm Elizabeth banks and you're watching...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Corny
RSUq4VfWfjE,"La única q queda regia para ser una Angel es la morena, las otras 2 NAAAAAAAH!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Original ladies had class. This bunch just trash.....Diversity, feminism instead of quality actors....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well Bella looks banging!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cameron Diaz was hot😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like the cast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They are trying to hard. It’s like HEY LOOK THESE WOMEN ARE COOL AND INDEPENDENT. In the original it really wasn’t pointed out, because THE AUDIENCE CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE. Is this just me or?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,That’s how you know Hollywood has ran out of ideas when they start remaking stuff that was already remade
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its embarrassing how bad this is
RSUq4VfWfjE,C'mon guys lets look at the positives....theres some guns....& some shootin...& some splosions....thats pretty cool....right? *sigh*
RSUq4VfWfjE,So awesomeeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,People always find reasons to complain..smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t even with this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously? Another bad movie and they'll call us misogynistic, suffering from toxic masculinity etc. etc."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"GIRL POWER 
LOL
GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ruining a classic..........Yikers.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop incoming...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot wait!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,dang naomi scott is in eVERYTHING since she played the pink ranger. you go girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's feminist?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Women:  have this magical power where they can create life and make a person come out of them.

Movies:  Being a woman is about beating up men in action movies!  Forget about that amazing super power you have!

That’s like movies telling Superman to forget about his super powers and be Clark Kent.  Yeah, Superman should just be a journalist."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm actually interested! I've never seen the originals and I don't care.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Most trailers start out slow and build to something. I think what annoys me about this trailer is it's just fast and rhythmic  for 3 minutes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Smh movie producers are out of ideas. Their originality and creativity has deteriorated and it shows...BADLY!!!! Like y’all heard they’re making a Dora the explorer live action movie 😑🤦🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"looks like we have another modern, obviously politically structured ""girl power"" movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow that is the hottest person I've ever seen, the girls are okay."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks: Check out the Charlie's Angels trailer right now

Begining song: *DoN't CaLl mE aNgEl*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No...until I saw Patrick Stewart. That choice literally made the production company get my money.
RSUq4VfWfjE,We doing this again?.......
RSUq4VfWfjE,“De oxygenized his brain stem” so fancy new term for suffocation.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Annnnd they are all unsurprisingly hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, they screwed this one up! I  miss the  original cast. Miley Cyrus, REALLY!  GARBAGE!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t understand why so many people are already hating this movie since it hasn’t even come out yet o.o
What does it mean that you want Liu, Barrymore and Diaz back? It’s nonsense. Time has passed, in case you didn’t notice. 
Honestly, I see no hurt in making reboots and having different actresses. Stop being negative about stuff you haven’t even watched yet. 
If you really wanna discuss something about this trailer, well yeah, I have to agree that the music choice is not superb. But you can’t tell from a two-minute video that a whole movie is gonna be shitty already."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Search here for (Sucker For a Pretty Face) by Rockcandy, it's a great 80s album!!!  Enjoy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg it’s the girl off of lemonade mouth AHAHHAhHhA
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really wanna see this!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this coming out in nov? Should've been like 30 secs long now I have to violently anticipate this movie until nov
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had no interest until I saw Captain Picard
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I liked it! Its too modern and refreshing😊 Simple answer to those who didn't like it! 
Me: DON'T WATCH IT! finished."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcet & Jaclyn Smith  are the original Charlie Angel's. Get your ""I hate remakes"" attitude outta here if you think Cameron, Lucy and Drew where first. 🙄🙄🙄 smh."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Better be avada kedavra aaaaaaah.😤😤..
What the hell ..
They don't even sink in ..bad choices ..not even gona watch let alone download it  nor watch it on HBO . PIX or YouTube nor on Amazon prime ..😕

Soooooooo baad ..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a female version the Kingsman movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,*K Stew is slaying*
RSUq4VfWfjE,FRICKEN NAOMI YASSS AND KRISTEN COMING BACK OADNSIIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hot garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks as bosley is a no go
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible:/
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie will make less than the new ghost busters movie lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,PASS!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really.  This looks so dead. Kristen Stewart still make that same facial expression that u see from twilight.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“Ugh more feminist propaganda, it’s just like hostbusters 2016”

But the 1970s original and the 2000 remake were all women too"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe sjw
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A movie made for feminist, 'cause men suck!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,hey ellen HAJAJHJAHSJS
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie will go down in flames like the new Ghostbuster.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really wish they didn’t pick twilight girl for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People calling this movie bad and then comparing it to the older movies as if those were better? That's like me saying ""Thor being able to fly is stupid because the hammer has no means of propulsion, unlike Superman who can't use magic but flies anyway."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony is literally writing names of the franchises they own in little pieces of paper, placing them in a hat, and picking out which one to reboot next. 'Ghostbusters' (2016), then 'Men in Black: International' (2019), and now this. The only reboot that seems to have worked is the recent 'Spider-Man', and that's because it's a part of the MCU."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels going woke no ty.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Again? Why? 
At least try to be original for once, Hollywood"
RSUq4VfWfjE,.... They ruined Charlie's Angels...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lost some braincells watching this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry but the old one looks better
RSUq4VfWfjE,How is the trailer less than 3 minutes long? It feels like an eternity.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna bomb in theaters😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:50 mira nomas a javi noble
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like it couldn't been a cool action movie. Is there anyone around who _still_ doesn't realize masculinity is under attack? Rewatch this trailer and then tell me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can anyone say Ghostbusters remake. I see a huge fail here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me encanta que salga Luis Gerardo, Kristen hermosisima mujer bueno todas están lindas ♥️ ya quiero verla"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where are Patrick Stewart and Djimon Honsou's names?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I predict a score of 25 on the Flixster Tomatometer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It appears the morons in SJW land haven't learned their lesson from the last 49 failed remakes......   Lets hope number 50's failure FINALLY sinks in. Or not. I'm fine with Hollywood getting flushed down the toilet. Then sane folks can revive it in a decade or two and it can go back to making movies that don't suck...or preach...or lecture....or all the other things SJWism has done to our movies to kill the industry.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Que coisa lindaaaaaaa!!! 💖💖💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,Big Yikes 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart...enough said!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks awful and bland. Stop dragging ancient movies back to life, it's always doomed to fail in this generation, you've been nothing but failures at Sony Pictures for a long time anyways. Just...YUCK to this trailer."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who the hell did the audio mixing? It's atrocious.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even the trailer looks bad. Who even asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewert couldnt dave this film😔 i prah her charm and beauty id enough
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is an insult!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it too much to ask that Elizabeth banks not be the most attractive female?  Seems like a poor choice of angels if you ask me
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Stop it, Sony. No one asked for this. You should have just left the dust unsettled"
RSUq4VfWfjE,so woke!
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yo it's 2019 why are the angels not men!! This is just  wrong on so many level call the police
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ll pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks like she’s seducing the camera and I am fine with that 😮😤🥵
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ladies and gentlemen, Charles Xavier has retired because of this trailer..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I predict that it will make it's prop budget back
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Again
. Jeez cant come up with anything origional any more.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else getting batwoman vibes?
RSUq4VfWfjE,mainstream actors🤦‍♀️. What’s wrong with hiring grown women/women who look like grown women to play grown women roles? So over you all hiring these corny actors who look like bieber fans for everything 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"... What happened to The Expandabelles movie? Like really, I would've LOVED to see that and instead I get a remake of a remake. Shame."
RSUq4VfWfjE,am I the only one that think that this movie’s badass ..?
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:31 You can see the fake tan line on Kristin's forehead....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t remember the last time I saw Patrick Stewart smiling in a film. Thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,i really thought kristen stewart was niall horan in the thumbnail
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood come on?!?!?! You didnt put a tranny or 2 in there.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ve watched this three times just to see Kristen Stewart’s outfits 😮😤🥵
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The original Charlie's Angles (1976) was about detective-work, not about violence."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I get that this looks like hot garbage stacked on wet garbage stacked on hotter garbage but can we not pretend this is a beloved franchise being ruined it is just another crap movie reboot of a crap movie reboot of a passable show that went off the air before half the people on here were even born
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart’s looking pretty again!! Here for this!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who notice a aladdin heroine🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,This series will not survive in this day and age
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Six. Elizabeth Banks’ name appears in this six times, in case you were wondering."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it really so bad they're remaking stuff for the next generation? I like the look of this- it seems fun and enjoyable, and I didn't even realise there was another film until I came and read this (almost unnecessarily negative) comments section."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another pile of crap movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Upside down pyramid and lyching in the movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is gonna bomb so hard lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jimbos Uber Mentoring blog is now live on google
RSUq4VfWfjE,"another political correctness show n what a surprise, they screwed up"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is sooo exciting !! Charlie's Angels are baackk.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanted an All Male Cast for Charlie's Angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks sure is Elizabeth Banks as Elizabeth Banks directed by Elizabeth Banks also starring Elizabeth Banks'ing this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Instead of using three chicks, they probably could've just used 2 dudes. amirite?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,That’s the murderer from Murder Mystery. Juan?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will probably be the first girl movie I go see. Edit nevermind it looks cringe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m only watching this cuz of Patrick stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I cant wait to see
Hay dos paisanos 🇲🇽🇲🇽"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,The chicks are fine but the movie itself looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Prefiero las de antes
RSUq4VfWfjE,This feels like a gender-switched Kingsmen lol. Better be a scene where Elizabeth Banks goes nuts on a church full of people
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A movie with every single PC box checked off!   well done Hollywood, it looks awful which seems to be a trend with checkbox movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies: The Movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,The people in the comments should get over themselves
RSUq4VfWfjE,...I’m into it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When do we get the song plssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its K Stew my love....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes or no the original one is better then this hehe
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 the year of Vuj 1:55
RSUq4VfWfjE,MF KRISTEN STEWART
RSUq4VfWfjE,Instead  of already  calling  it terrible  just wait for when the full movie comes  out. give it a chance
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The feminist signals is strong in this one. I mean seriously, it's overbearing. Damn! 🤔🤔🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s Angels? More like Totally Spies!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Unpopular Opinion but I can’t wait for this to come out
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s Cameron Diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony, the company that brought you the best Spider Man Movie, is back at it again with another trash film."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Por qué no pensaron en Zendaya Bella Thorne y Elle Fanning?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful...will still probably watch for Stewart's lesbo cut tho...
RSUq4VfWfjE,You all calling it bad but you know going to watch it as it drops... You know you will
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eh...whatever...🤷‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thought kristen Stewart was only doing more serious indi roles to make up for twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,So he left x man to do Charlie..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thought this was a terrible joke but some of the cast makes me smile
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh HELL no
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks like something from the series Totally Spies instead of Charles's Angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sex video games
RSUq4VfWfjE,"To be fair, this movie doesn't look too bad. It just seems like it wants to appeal to 20something young party girls wanting to feel empowered, and there's not much else besides that. There's nothing interesting about the plot or characters (apart from 'Girl powah yeeeeah'), which makes me wholly uninterested in this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just watched the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry ... I need the old cast back
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Bosley being played by a woman?  If this is feminists based story line it will suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Direct to DVD movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This actually looks like great fun time. 👍👍✌️ didn't expect that 
But of course the ""internet anti-sjw and hate police"" will be trying to bash it all the way..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony wtf r u doing...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why these movies suck they're complete garbage so they made a new one with even worse actors
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this the totally spies live action movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell to the no!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a mess!! RIP Charlie’s angels thanks Sony studios for messing this up!!! It’s gonna flop!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell low budget
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where is the dark, gritty expendables style reboot.  I wanna see  Amy schumer suffocate a midget by stuffing him in her vagina."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARMLESS........ THEY LOOK LIKE A BOYS..........
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin Stewart a Charlie angel? What?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony should stick to ruining Michael Jackson’s legacy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is so damn hot in that character 😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,So much needs to be said about this Film but I won't because I'll be called Sexist.... so all I'll say is Bozley is supposed to be a Dude and Bozley doesn't go out in the field at least not like this also Charlie is never supposed to be seen and in the old TV Show it was said that reason is in case an Angel goes Bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart still doesn't know how to do a credible punch. Looks like her wrist is going to snap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,“Look how they massacred my boy”
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't want to see this but I also don't want to be sexist. Gahhhh got me again.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's too bad because there's a lot of great creative writers and directors out there who could be making all-time great films if they had the backing of major studios behind them. But instead we keep paying the same jerkwad directors to keep making the same jerkwad movies with the same jerkwad actors over and over and over and ov....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Also this looks like another stupid feminist movie. Just like the other feminist movie marvel end game was such stupid waste my money. Movies these days are crap. Stop changing the characters a man for a woman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bring back Video stores and then send this flick straight there.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m just excited to see Kristen Steward again. And the new song By Ari, Lana, and Miley."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Shows the whole movie, and it's also terrible."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Running out of ideas huh?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's transgenders
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im only interested in Arianas new song
RSUq4VfWfjE,The new song is homophobic because you can barely hear Lana del rey fight me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whyyyyy?????????? Bleh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love how they give away the whole movie in the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yawn, cool yea, whatever. just give me the song so i can decide wither i want to download it or not"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They really downgraded the cast huh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ahhh,  those super heroes ....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lemme guess, the villains are all males right?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer editor: 
How much do you want to appear in the trailer?

Elizabeth Banks and her ego: 
YES"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes...that's all
RSUq4VfWfjE,I promise u the villain in this movie is a guy...
RSUq4VfWfjE,trash but atleast they let u know right at the start
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This reminds me of a show my sis watched when she was younger. I think it was called totally spy's, spice or something like that"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is so stupid and so Corny now. You got to add a black one and bosly a woman lol.. Ridiculous geez. People dont waste your money on this ridiculous movie. Should stick to Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. Again waste of time."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody asked for this.... Sony, just stop"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not sold
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems flaky.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't completely hate it because of Patrick Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worst thing I have ever seen...
RSUq4VfWfjE,( ಠ ʖ̯ ಠ)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Go lock yourself in a room & watch this Charlie's Angels & Sonic trailer back to back over & over for a day or 2, reply me with results pls."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Could be a fun ride.
RSUq4VfWfjE,My boy Charlie has a harem
RSUq4VfWfjE,@garrett watts is shaking
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ah, KStew, you are *so* hot......"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I mean... it doesn't look terrible. But I probably wouldn't shell out money to watch it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great for lesbos specially Kristin stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh gawd a reboot of a remake nobody asked for
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great for lesbos specially Kristin stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great for lesbos specially Kristin stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girls with short hair? Really
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why another feminist John Wick?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was excited about this movie before the trailer... I guess i'm not anymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks very provokative, I'm willing to give it a chance"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The comment section is more entertaining than the movie.
Such an insult to the three iconic ones and only original stars ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gonna bomb harder than MIB.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As long as the heroines perform 69s on each other, It's a riotous watch for me!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Captain Jean Luc Picard!!

I love Sir Patrick Stewart. I’m in."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great, another reboot no one asked for."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Guess Patrick Stewart needed some spending money, lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came for Kristen and Elizabeth and left just cause...
RSUq4VfWfjE,....but why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana:... hangels :/.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I find it hilarious that many here keep on hating because it's not Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. As if THEY were the original Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just hear for that sweet Lana - Miley - Ariana Collab
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just hear for that sweet Lana - Miley - Ariana Collab
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only two boxes left unchecked on the diversity list was a transexual and the movie being half in Spanish.   6 out of 10.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony really struggling with franchises other than spiderman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Could have picked some hotter chicks.. but this will do.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood running out of ideas so they rebooting EVERYTHING smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"🤦🏾‍♂️ I just dunno what to say is this a Charlie’s angels film 🤷🏾‍♂️

Just put this out as a tv special and then lock this movie away never to be seen again 🤦🏾‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The ONLY reason I'm hear is for Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The world didn't need this movie. At least it has given us a new single from Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey! (Insert eyeroll here)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,what the hell i just watched???
RSUq4VfWfjE,👀👍💩. Skip!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another classics of 90s childhood being spoiled...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was the original cast too busy or something??. No disrespect but no one asked for this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, Kristen Stewart looks uncomfortable in this movie... any movie to be totally honest, why is that?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should have put Destiny Child Music in their
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously. When will they cast men to play the leads in Charlie's Angels. Bunch of sexists in Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism at its best Yuks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dafuq is this?! Looks like straight to dvd quality movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"TrAsH CaN
People defending this disaster is part of the huge problem on why Hollywood is garbage."
RSUq4VfWfjE,remake? meh 😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,poor choice of characters@@ its just a messy movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Basically discount Kingsman without any sense of culture. Thanks Hollywood.
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOND WILL BE FEMALE...in a few years
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Djomiiiiiin! 
*Fanning self"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this trailer exists??? It's terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uiiiio9uhnmun
Tebow was the 3AM of the season"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"now a days the world has become too much woman centric, that its absurdly insane.. send half of them to mars."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer makes me feel indifferent.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I bet you most of the people making fun or talking bad about this movie is going to see it when it comes out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Eh, at least I get my Ariana-Miley-Lana collaboration out of this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yooo... Wtf? They put the whole billboard 100 in this trailer. So shitty. Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,I personally LOVED every second of this trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"New talent, bring what you got ladies, I want to see it!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m more excited for the single than the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't know what's bleeding more. My ears or my eyeballs?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Recent SONY hits:
Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2
Ghostbusters (2016)

Pixels
Smurfs: the lost village

SONYS ON A ROLL!!!!!:)))))"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This ain’t it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kinda trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer: *Exist*
Will Smith: It's Rewind Time!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤢🤢🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks turns out to be the bad guy....boom.
RSUq4VfWfjE,You fucking male simps are acting like this movie series wasn’t already bad and full of woman power. It’s literally what it’s known for how df y’all so mad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pandering to a whole new level
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's make Charlie's Angles an all men cast :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,There are many badass actresses who could have been in this movie. What gives?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh how much you pay for those likes
RSUq4VfWfjE,still fapable though
RSUq4VfWfjE,From director Elizabeth Banks. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,shouldn't one of them be asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another remake with added feminism propaganda.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I guess many haven't rewatched the angels from 20 years ago...the special effects have become sooo outdated and cringey. I literally saw the 2nd one and you can tell where they edited out the wires, like come on. Give it q chance and hate it after you're forced to watch it for one reason or another or wait for review idk."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like this is promoting a song rather than a movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stewart, Sony screwing you over again"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When does the single come out 
I need it😤🔥🔥🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw Charles Xavier there!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seeing Kristen Stewart being this expressive is awesome.
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least they didn't make a remake changing all the genders.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is my wife now a sexist for not wanting to see this garbage movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Absolute garbage. Can already see this flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here’s the thing... No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s Aladdin and the genie???
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only reason why this movie won't suck lemons at the cinema is due to Patrick Stewart. Everything about this trailer is screaming meh!
RSUq4VfWfjE,of course bosley is a woman now...
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG IM DYING CHAVA IS IN THIS TOO
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of the worst trailers Of 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,If they want to remake Charlie's Angels they should make the Angels guys.
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙅🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope they get they asses beat.
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO ORIGINALITY ANYMORE!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,More Hollywood crap for the people.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did anyone actually ask for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm all for another installment in the Charlie's Angels verse. Not sure why people are saying ""reboot"" since it's a sequel. We have so many installments in other action industries, but the campy wink-wink action fun in this verse isn't really matched elsewhere. I don't care about all the people upset about all-girl casting either (especially since Patrick Stewart could rock some drag, but isn't a girl). Those same people aren't in arms on all the trailers for all-guy casting where, if there is a girl, she's only pivotal if she dies. So yay for escapism fun in this action verse."
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks awful . Looks like another spy film to me but not Charlie’s angels .  I love how the old versions made in a very fun and cool way .  That was the fanciest film of early 2000s . But this one doesn’t seem fancy to me :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No, just NO!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:34
0:44
0:49
Is that Abella danger ???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Poor Patrick Stewart.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Carmen Diaz is the real charlie angle the leader
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another political agenda movie....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously? Even russians can do better...🙄😕
RSUq4VfWfjE,May the odds be ever in your favour
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminists pretending they represent a voice for women. LOL More like girls who want to be like men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I for one want to see this movie. The ogs were great, but I love the look of this! Seems fun ^-^"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't care what literally everyone else in the world says




I love Kristen Stewart ❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this basically showed the whole movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,We want hindi trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is this an Anna Costume from Frozen in the wardrobe? XD
Terrible Trailer btw"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Welcome to 40th Golden Raspberry Awards winner.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart is my favorite actress, and I can't WAIT to see this when it comes out! It looks really interesting, and seems to have a great cast as well!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This might just be the manliest movie of 2019!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think this will be entertaining.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart what were you thinking??? This was so awful I couldn't watch till the end!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 the year of Naomi Scott!
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF is time?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t get the logo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood runnin out of idea? Just remake old movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,We all know this is gonna be as bad as it seems
RSUq4VfWfjE,"first batman, now this.                                                     lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe Hollywood you have no imagination can't come up with anything new have to remake the remakes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Definite failure
RSUq4VfWfjE,y
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super terrible!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood: We can remake anything we want to. 
Everyone else: Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.


rip etika"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now there's 4 unnecessary reboots made by Sony:
-Amazing spider-man
-Ghostbusters
-Men in black
-Charlie's angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks fucking horrible but ima watch it anyways
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want my original cast back! Patrick Stewart should be charlie, why are their 3 Bosleys? 



R.I.P BERNIE MAC"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im surprised I actually like this but they didn’t need to call it Charlie’s angels or like continue the brand they could have just made it a seperate movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"She wasn't dead 0:00 , i mean her child killed her"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hate to say this, but the first Sonic trailer is better than this whole movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Niomee Scott's mom is *GUJARATI*
RSUq4VfWfjE,i-
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really want the real song!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles? How are you alive?
RSUq4VfWfjE,we have no idea on how this movie is going to turn out. just because the women in these newer remakes are “less sexy” doesn’t mean they are bad. it just means that you all can’t think without using your dicks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Painfully stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hate it already
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Anybody remember when Bosley was a guy?

Edit: and is Patrick Stewart Charlie? If not wtf"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only came for Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love you Kristen great fan.o'sm trailer great action.totally I love you so much 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hear Ariana and I’m hyped for the soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hahahahah Sony Pictures is on fire! Please continue pumping out as much feces as possible, I'm really curious as to how high they can stack their crap without collapsing to the ground :)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m the only one who’s waiting to see it ? C’mon i think it will be really cool and fun 😉
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie was made for the lesbians, dudebros. This is a gays only event"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aaand as soon as It started I knew this was already gonna be trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,why!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks painfully boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,The casting is too diverse for me. It just doesn't seem like a Charlie's Angels movie. I hate when they change the formula.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When you Kristen Stewart ,not in Twilight but one of the Angel of Charlie.. 🤭🤭🤗"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol who is really going to watch this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks pretty lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People complaining about Hollywood making remakes/remakes, are usually the same people who never go to the movie theater to support original movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY IS BOSLEY A WOMAN!?!?!?!?!?! TF
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just love it when the trailer gives the whole movie away
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like the same kind of dumpster fire that the female ghost busters was. I couldn't even finish the trailer and I love Jean Luc Picard! This is gonna be a major flop-a-roo.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollyweird- stop. Just stop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"editors: what song should we use for the trailer 
Elizabeth banks: let's use multiple songs throw them in glitter and mix them up so they make the ears pop and don't go with the temple of the trailer at all"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie better be a girl or these feminist are going to go wild
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shut it down immediately
RSUq4VfWfjE,I won't watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: watches the first ten seconds 




Okay I already hate it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to flop very bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,The font makes the movie look like a spinoff from the Dead or Alive games...
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:02 reminds me of the Disney ads before each show
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, it actually surprises me but I liked it!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,sometimes I think feminists don't know what feminism is. this would have been great had it been helmed by a Ryan coogler kind of guy coz his fresh or even a female director that wont throw glitter at an aspiring project and guilt other women into watching it by preaching feminism. I reckon patty Jenkins would have made this movie bleed in profits had they just waited for her to film wonder woman 1984 coz I've been watching trailers forever and i cant recall one where the soundtrack was being advertised and not the movie🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,But why?

Got one out of 4, yep this ones not for me, very sad.  im just old then. modern music, didnt fit and female bosly well it felt err no comment.  Next time make charlie the billionare woman but ffs keep bosly as a midleaged bald man. 
It was not designed to apeal to me and it doesnt so great job.  Defo strugle to make its money unless it cost 5 million to make.


Whats wrong with a straight forward adulation of angels, with some old music.  


Something like this but modern would have gotten my but in the seat

RSUq4VfWfjE,Y'all judging the movie before it even comes out.. Like chill out 😂

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m a huge fan of the early 2000’s CA Movies and this looks Iike such a huge, cringy disappointment. The acting is emotionless and dead, the music... just no. Just no to the whole damn thing"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Toxic girl power propaganda
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF is this Feminazi trash? This is an insult to the first ones.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I’d rather watch the Ghostbusters 2016 train wreck instead of this dumpster fire🤦🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I still like Charlie's Angels 2000.
Funny Glamourous Action so natural, and the chemistry of Drew Cameron Lucy is awesome, cool and witty! 😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not PC enought, they should have used the ghostbusters cast for this movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So feminist  why ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn... Another woman movie sure to fail
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It would have been way better if they just did another one with Lucy Lu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,How can a trailer with so many action shots be so boring? Can someone recut this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks fun might watch it in the cinema. Why hate a movie before its released.
RSUq4VfWfjE,With Kristen Stewart really😂🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whaaaaaaat? women receiving orders from the white man?! Unacceptable! 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why? This doesn't need to exist. Nobody wants this
RSUq4VfWfjE,garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why are y’all popping a vein over this movie? if you don’t like it then don’t watch baby its not that hard
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who signed off on this 🙃
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well this looks trash

RSUq4VfWfjE,N-Noah?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Someone correct me if I am wrong but wasn't the original idea of Charlie Angels was sexy badbutt women who save the world. Is this not what the movie about?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yes

Yeess


YEEEEESSSSSS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No. Just. No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So the movie was shown in less then 2 minutes essentially. I'll give it a painstaking 2/10 and thats cause Patrick Stewart. I feel like not even women will really want to watch this. I could give you over 20 reasons why, and thats just the trailer. Could they not find a single confident woman who lifts to reprise atleast 1 role as one of the angels? Only thing this is sending me into is a mcdonalds to buy them something to eat. And I haven't eaten at one in over 10 years, so thats saying something. Michelle rodriguez would of made a great choice, among about 20 other females for these roles. BIG OOF for this movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no they didn't!? 😳
RSUq4VfWfjE,Proof that trending is paid for

RSUq4VfWfjE,Wasting Charlie angle
RSUq4VfWfjE,No. Sorry. Next
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron, Drew, Lucy: on behalf of this atrocity, I am so sorry for this disrespect."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Já vi que é uma porcaria. Um Bosley mulher? As Panteras como se fossem super espiãs? Vou rever a série dos anos 70 que tem mais futuro
RSUq4VfWfjE,The sound track sounds worse than the movie looks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No oigo a Lana del Rey en la canción.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shows Charlie's face in trailer.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ewwww
You can't just use Janelle Monáe's music like that?!
I mean you can... but you can't..."

RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm interested in ariana's song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another flop to add to 2019.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie is probably gonna have feminism referenced ALOT. 

So I will not waste a movie ticket on it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many dumb-a$$ rubes are going to watch this garbage? Pathetic state of affairs with the average intelligence level nowadays.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, let's just keep doing old movies remakes. reset time approaching..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So lets just pick the most average Angels ever!!! The whole trailer so bad... I can’t!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,YEAS
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is gonna be such a shitfest
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it possible to take a show with powerful female leads and feminazi it? Yes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love how even though they're having a woman direct it, they're still letting the Angels be sexy, just not in a 'pure exploitation' kind of way :)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Make a new movie... this is pathetic
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really like Elizabeth Banks, but come on, this is a mess"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like fun :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,How much did they pay Patrick Stewart to be in this movie Must've been a lot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How it's like to ruin a classic ? 
Charlie Angels : YES ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,yawn
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash! Why do this? Why not just create a bomb a$$ spy action movie with these ladies instead of rebooting a reboot.😞😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No, just NO"
RSUq4VfWfjE,You might wanna think about changing the name to X Women
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well this looks bad..Wait Patrick Stewart is bosley this has hope, Oh hes not bosley. Oh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stuart:  Charlie
Joke with  X Men. Ridiculous !!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The ONLY remake that was acceptable was the one played by Drew, Lucy, and Cameron."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I could make a better movie in shops class.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Original taste is gone.......
RSUq4VfWfjE,"cool, but no dark skinned people at all?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woooooi
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s feminist angels !!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Part of me wants to see a Charlie's Angels remake with a lead male cast, I'd love to see the response to that."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Everyone: sony makes such bad remakes




sony: DONT STOP ME NOW"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I dunno did it need a remake, they said it wasn't going to be sexed up I believe, well that was a massive lie , and from what I see , the clothes thing is way out offensive 
Maybe it's just me 😬"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyone enough with the hate comments. I’m liking them to much 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,The h in the word women means humor
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess I’ll just watch Gone Girl for the 500th time.
RSUq4VfWfjE,‘Flop’ comes to mind..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this real life? I wanna throw up
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:08 aaaand there's the fail
RSUq4VfWfjE,sighhhhh...can you come up with anything original?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the sex appeal?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait it’s all woman that’s sexist
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Producer: “What should we use for the trailer?” 

Director: “The whole movie.”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is exactly how I expected a Charlie’s Angels movie to look in 2019:

Ariana Grande✅

F e m I n I s m ✅

Elizabeth Banks✅

Stock action scenes✅

Girl holding big gun✅

Stupid Men.✅

Jokes made by shitty corporate writers✅

...can’t wait."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I blinked too late and didn't manage to skip seeing Patrick Stewart make a fool of himself. Damn.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"After this, we deserve a Charlie's Angels/Kingsmen crossover film."
RSUq4VfWfjE,...oh boy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can already TELL people will find a way to be mad about this hahhahahahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is 💓💫
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m bored of remakes. Call me when something original happens.
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:25 look at the power behind those elbows. She’s going to kill that poor guy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I say make Rocky  ..XXIV.....LOL

RSUq4VfWfjE,Y does this feel like a fast and furious movie?🙃
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lack of boobs 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m not gunna wait to order  the tickets for this movie like a did for endgame, wait a minute..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,You gotta be kidding.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew Barrymore Lucy Liu Cameron Diaz .You three are greatly missed.We want you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the all male reboot? Im confused...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"so the tw@t's think they're ""fighting the patriarchy"" by making Bosley a chick with a d!ck? not going to watch this nonsense!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wack
RSUq4VfWfjE,No.... No....No.... Plz don't.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When I saw the thumbnail I thought it was a parody
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didnt the last Charlie Angel remake tell us that Charlies Angel should never have a remake ever? Now this comes out? Hollywood is being so lazy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yet no one complains about the constant comic book remakes? I’m down for this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look like Charlie's... Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Like a video game for feminists*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does Kristen Stewart look like 2013 Miley Cyrus
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringefest
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks so garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn they going to just disrespect icon lucy liu like that... trash 😪
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We want friends _the movie. But no, this is what we get.😕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks smoking hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watching it for surem
RSUq4VfWfjE,No...just no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fucking mass dislike this already....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Honestly I'm excited for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WHAT IS THIS NOW 😒
They are ruining our  favorite movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this looks like it was made somewhere in early 00s between Mission impossible 2 and Charlie 's angels 2 and with a sandwich budget?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aladdin, please leave Jasmin! 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just here to hear Ariana’s voice
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody
Sony: we will give you remake of something you don't even want"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen, you rockin' that hair girl. Inbox me 😎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Orginal one was better then this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I get it. It’s Charlie’s Angles except everyone is a woman. What an innovative and interesting rewrite!!! 🤯🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo is again playing himself in this all women movie😁😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,The colorism is real.
RSUq4VfWfjE,To the idiots who keep saying it's a remake or reboot. It is not a remake but a continuation from the first two movies snd tv show. It's a new generation of angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only reason to watch is kristen stewart 😍❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,He slaps the mints out of her hand and then says don't touch some of these blow up . ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,yall can suck it i'm excited to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great! Now I don’t even have to see the movie anymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's also here for Ariana Grande...?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Every action movie with a girl with a lesbian short haircut is doom to suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,When X man meets Charlie's Angel s
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Y'all hating but gon end up WATCHING IT ANYWAYS* 

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is no one gonna mention Noah Centineo being in this, it’s obviously just to get 12 year old girls to watch it. The cringe from this trailer is palpable"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay, I'll def see this! 
(I liked Drew Barrymore in the first CA movie, but Cameron Diaz's perky goofiness and butt-dancing put me off) 😒"
RSUq4VfWfjE,one clip of noah cineto and I'm sold
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously stop with the remakes create your own damn movie 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not gonna lie I hated the first thing (@0:08) in the beginning of this trailer. It felt like a forced placement of Feminism and I'm a chick saying this. They could have done that better then that then make it so... ah.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Check  out AJR. Their music is great!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Straight to rebox!!! No 4k releases!! Hahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just here for the song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yea... this is gonna bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Let me go leave hate comments on a trailer that's not targeted to my demographic but I still need to go make my opinion heard because I am the center of the universe AND Gods gift to this earth."" -inner monologue of the men in this comments section who are complaining about female remakes DESPITE Charlie's Angels always being about strong FEMALE FUCKING AGENTS."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is....a thing. But from what i'm seeing it isn't a remake and seems to have its own characters and storyline.
RSUq4VfWfjE,02:05 Miley or Kristen?
RSUq4VfWfjE,From when Hollywood script writers were inspired from Bollywood ones???
RSUq4VfWfjE,This exists for what reason
RSUq4VfWfjE,please don't
RSUq4VfWfjE,how about godfather 3
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:57 what car is that?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi again wow wow!
RSUq4VfWfjE,i’m only watching for ariana.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks trash..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who are these people.  Lack Star Power!
RSUq4VfWfjE,yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yaa... 
Worst film with some @$$@"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey look another reboot that will most likely be “meh” at best
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They tried but failed, cant compare with the original one."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another all women cast, this is  guaranteed to bomb"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do remakes always have to fail miserably?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really can't smell anything else but a really bad Rotten Tomatoes and Roger Ebert review
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I mean the trailer in top YouTube trending 🤷🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Leave it to the crazy SJW's to reboot a classic movie franchise with only women. Men can act to, Sony!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This feels like the trailer for a whole season of a TV show. These set pieces do not seem to correlate with each other.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As someone who doesn’t know anything about Charles Angels, this looks like Totally Spies PG"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They’re really pushing womanhood these days ain’t they?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Couldn’t even watch all the 3mints of trailer 😴😴😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,Horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,GIRL POWER
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is it just me? Once in an action movie I'd like to see a 110lb female punch/kick/jujuitsu the ""evil"" henchman and he just brush it off then choke slam her through a table......"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:37 Well, at least they have their privileges :v"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm not mad at the trailer. I'm mad at the team who mixed the music and the audio together for this trailer. The music jumping and the audio dips whenever people talked was really obvious and distracting from the video. 
Movie itself looks like it'll be fun tho."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's see how much closer it can get to the original one 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay we get it - WOMEN ARE AWESOME! Gheez! As soon as I saw they had replaced Bosley's character with a chick I knew this was going to be yet another estrogen-fueled, MeToo Movement, feminist piece of claptrap!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I posted a super funny Happy Wheels video 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,No story & missed the target. Oops.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Me enorgulleces gerardo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just a worst version.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the fucking theme music?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should do an all male version of this, it is 2019 after all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:54 *HUGEEE !*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t understand these negative comments people remake movies all the time. And you’re giving it negative comments before you see it. My personal opinion is to not have any opinions about the movie until it’s released and you’ve seen it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Maybe ill wait till it comes.out.on hbo or red box but im definitely not waisting hard earned money at the theater. Well maybe the dollar cinima.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y remake an iconic movie.. Trailer is disappointing
RSUq4VfWfjE,LGBT Angel's 🤦🏽‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already got a bad feeling about this
RSUq4VfWfjE,omg that lesbian twilight chick
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there the beiber boy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can’t wait to the film industry crash and burn because of all the mediocrity, Shallow/uninspired ideas, A slew of re-iterations of classic movies trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator (A-la: Charlie’s Angels, The thing, The Terminator, etc...), and unnecessary continuations of movies that didn’t even get the clout or critical reception to deserve one. I’d just suggest people to explore new hobbies or invest in ones they’ve already had interest in more."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did you guys know that Elizabeth Banks is associated with this movie??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ocean’s Three 🤭
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm really looking forward to not ever seeing this movie!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why TF Bosley a white girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Excellent kristen in short hair....
Osm"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why?  Really... why?
This is the same question I asked for every Fast and Furious sequel.  More evidence that Hollywood has zero originality anymore."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see diversity is in full effect.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fabulous kristen...
I love her actions"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idgaf what people say. I’m here to see Kristen Stewart kick people’s asses and I will. I love her so much lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought they were supposed to be hot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't mind a female white Bosely, as long as she has the humour. 

I was going to give this a chance until Elizabeth Banks showed up. And the music is irritating, too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They really wanted to sell that song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This comes out the next week of Frozen 2 it's already bombed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,This plays better when you exit out of the window and throw the device in the garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great trailer but i feel like i watched the whole movie. 😒 hopefully i will forget most of it by nov.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels should be three men or its sexist.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let’s see how profitable misandry is.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks fucking TERRIBLE!!!! NOT MY ANGLES!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t even remember the original content but this is still a No for me just saying happy pride month
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist the Movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No Asians 😭

.im stupid i know"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmmmmm well gotta see it before I comment.🙃
RSUq4VfWfjE,These types of movies are the reason I look for indie and festival films.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dejen de sacar remakes hijos de p*t* inviertan en gente que si tiene buenas historias para producir
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im ok with this as long as there is no sjw agenda in this the Brown girl got a sexy accent
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley is a man...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As a fan of the original Charlies angles franchise I have so many problems with this movie, but unfortunately Hollywood isn’t going to stop the bad remakes, from ghostbusters to ocean 8 to batwoman and terminator. Sometimes I wonder if they will make a Mario movie with Mario being a sjw? ( that’s a joke"
RSUq4VfWfjE,There have been four versions done of this franchise and this fourth one should never gotten the green light
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love the way how people say this is gonna suck why make a remake well let me tell you this is NOT A REMAKE get your facts straight when you wanna say something
RSUq4VfWfjE,We need Cameron Diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please someone tell me this is a prank....🙄🙄🙏🙏😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlies angel's were sexy, sassy, classy and at the same time smart, courageous, independent... i don't know, these girls are also but something ain't right"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t wait 😊 👼🏽
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:......
StillNobody:.....
Sony: we will remake charlies angels with kristen stewart..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,CAPTIAN PICARD.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one who doesn't know what remake is this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hated it unitl I saw Patrick Stewart.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What gives anyone confidence that this won't be another mediocre remake that ends up only existing to obscure Google searches for the original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I blame bad consumerism for the lack of originality in *any field*
People will buy it simply because it is new.
Pitiful..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewarts is on this...........!!! Yyyyeee.....aahh I’ll pass!

This feels like: Turning James Bond into some Netflix teenage espionage flick...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How bad is the trailer? 

Everyone : Yes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did anyone see the costume from the 2000s movie where the angels sing.. makes me think this is not a reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s Bill Murray?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me, seeing Kristen Stewart in this trailer: Welp if I didn’t think I was bi before..... 🤷‍♀️😍🤤🤤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So sick of these remakes. This one looks bad too.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kik Cutieflair 19 f tight body teen paywhore selling live custom videos and pictures with no limits
RSUq4VfWfjE,Music is like that chick flick movie's music we all hate.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony should just quit making movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Once kristen stewart was acting in TWILIGHT ...
Melts my heart...

Now just fighting and running like harly quinn"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is most of Hollywood liberal but they use guns in every movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope your not going to label us all after not watching this like you did with the Ghostbusters. Hey! Twilight's in this one!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Short hair girl = liberated women power.... where is the fucking original Charlie’s angels theme song what is this ?!?!?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Remake of a remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only came for Naomi Scott❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,None of these actresses look like they could fight a wet noodle.  I’ll watch it in CinemaSins
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will bomb! Guaranteed
RSUq4VfWfjE,Comments are disabled for this video.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I only care about Miley, Ariana and Lana’s song"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well at least they use guns unlike the Barrymore version
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to really suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters 2016 all over again
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Kristen Stewart so beauuuuutifuuul
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf is this????? Lmaooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,another  sjw basedd feministic piece of crapp ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,the cast is just horrible 🤦🏼‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. Trending.... Love you Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy Liu, with my girl drew, Cameron Di, and Destiny - I'm SO sorry. 

This looks awful omg. Why do they keep remaking so many classic and ruining them?! 🙄

At least there's a new Ariana single to look forward to I guess."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"breaks my heart seeing so many talented people in the comments section, who could have made a better movie, just sitting at home commenting"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate it everytime i see this.. bring the original cast please
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It doesn't look completely terrible but I think if they wanted to revive/reboot this franchise, they should have gone down the dark, broody path. Turn it into like a Nikita/Alias type of movie. That said, Kristen Stewart looks like she's having a blast in this movie. I've never seen her smile so much."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Rarely am I pumped about these kind of movies, but this has some serious potential."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women should never be leaders. Women can’t fight like men. Pointless effort by Hollywood to keep pushing the MeToo movement. Get back in the kitchen and make me a sandwich. Then you can play the meat flute.
RSUq4VfWfjE,My problem with the trailer is that they're not showcasing the personalities and fighting skills of the characters and heavily relied it on bad jokes and spy movie trailer cliches
RSUq4VfWfjE,yall bunch of haters
RSUq4VfWfjE,This should have been remade with men! We can be angles too!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This was ”cool” in the 1970s. Looks like garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why wouldn’t noah centineo be in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"90% Talk about hating the trailer

RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm gonna watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love how everyone who talks about how unoriginal this movie is uses the same phrases to describe it......hahahahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm only excited for Lana del ray
RSUq4VfWfjE,There's 3 mins I'll never get back.😥😥😥
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder if people comment this much about un-originality on new Bond films...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I still love the original hehe
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew, Lucy, Cameron and Bill are probably downing doubles in pure disappointment right now"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop is what I think
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm confused between shitty as hell or hell as shitty 🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,"just.. how tall is that one girl.. it looks uncomfortably so, especially when she's standing beside the other angels😖😖😖"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another sjw lesbo show.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If this movie is a box office hit and everyone ends up loving it, these Angels will get a sequel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Instead of the 3 ladies why not cast a 90 year old man, a 5 year old little girl and a 50 year old woman confined in a wheelchair???? Just as plausible as 3 skinny girls taking out full grown men isn't it?????"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn't look as bad as I was lead to believe. Worth a look.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a waste of money
RSUq4VfWfjE,So they decided to end charlies angels in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I love phosphorus."" Jesus, that's just the kind of baseless, generic thing Noah Centineo really WOULD say 😭"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks horrible. More Hollywood gun glorification and garbage writing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley's a woman now? All the guy roles are turning into gals these days. If the producers want to play switcheroo, they should just go all the way with Charlene's Angels with guys as the three ""angels"".HeeHee!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who am I kidding, I'd still fucking watch this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,lmfao well the thumbs down count more than doubled since i was last here from 6k to 14k.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Old one was much much much much better .............
:("
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:54 hit like if u 
recognize the gun







       AUG😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, Sony is F'ing up again, The Smurfs, Ghost Busters, Men in Black, and now this hot mess.
They are terrible, Sony pictures must be one hell of a money pit for Sony."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The longest and the most distracting trailer I have ever seen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the hell...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony making another hit like Fantastic 4
RSUq4VfWfjE,How much you wanna bet the main bad guys are the anti-feminist groups
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naah....probably  would have been better without that vampire chick....what is her name again?
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin Stewart 🤢🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t care if it’s terrible, it looks fun. I’m definitely watching it anyways!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a such a pure garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s above me now...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here by Ariana Grande 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,at least change the song !
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Basically it’s cringey kingsman. That is until the kingsman remake outdoes it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate all the men here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Literally here to listen to a snippet of the miley Cyrus, Lana del Ray and Ariana grande collab"
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of those that I might download from torrent. Maybe. Not even sure.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I Like how they use the same exact font as  in Spider man : Far From Home for the marketing aka trailers .Real Creative......
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The new Angels is not that sick urghh iww 😤
Hollywood should pick someones better 😢"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ka - Ringe  😖😖😖
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well I am not even gonna say anything, Just gonna drop my dislike real quick then leave"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why cast Kristen Stewart tho she expired and in my opinion not right for the role
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So much glamour, so much power,so much hotness , so much thunder !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana, Miley and Lana together are the only angels I care about."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m only here bc of Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought that was Abella Danger in the thumbnail, almost made me excited for this movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This didn't need to be made..why cant companies make movies that are original..instead of throwing a dart at the dart board for a reboot?

I am guessing it wl bomb since the movie fatigue has been setting in for awhile and this just isnt very appealing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girls spy sucks...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weren't they happy with three female leads that they had to appropriate the male role of Bosley into a female too?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wo Wo Wo WOKE!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:30 what the fck is professor X doing there ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the best fan made trailer ever. Academy award nominee for that person who did it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here for Naomi Scott and Noah centenio 💙
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ari, Miley AND Lana in one song...This film is gonna prove all these haters wrong 😍😍😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,We can’t have Lana Del Rey be part of a bad movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People: stop using women as sex objects
Also people: oh boy a new Charlie's angels movie, I love it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley is just a new secret way of saying host or handler. No thanks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,so unnecessary
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony, when will you learn..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,How do you delete a movie ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder who's the new Charlie
RSUq4VfWfjE,the close up hitting scenes is so convincing and real.... -_-
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yaay female power ;-;
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't remember asking for this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dude....she shoulda been Captain Marvel instead....








I was talking about Kristen Stewart..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hate how they have to emphasize that they are women over and over again, I feel like they are making this movie for the wrong reasons"
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Too Feminism* 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ella Balinska, yowch!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks made this movie, that why it going to sucks. She directs, produced, and act in this horrible movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think the action looks bomb. It doesn’t look that bad. And obviously it can’t be the original. But it doesn’t automatically make it the worst thing ever.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, it's a no for me"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drunks running Hollywood..🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie would’ve been dope if it had a different name really!,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ain't getting that money back.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think they are rubbing pussies.

Edit: i mean lesbians"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yay for feminism
Nay for originality"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looking like Jinx Maze on the far right 😂
They all look like pornstars if you think about it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gayyyyyyyyyy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is by far better than what Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Berrymore did and I can't wait for the release."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"looks trash.... but sometimes, i like trash"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like the original tv series and movies were all about the 3 angels but now it seems it’s all about Bosley......
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart actually acting now? like every movie she was in she was just boring and was the same in every movie. This movie she actually acting now?
RSUq4VfWfjE,You never ever can't replace the old one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This won’t have half the charisma as the ones with Cameron, Lucy, and Drew. No problem against these ladies, you can just tell. Also, the music really helped add something special to the previous ones."
RSUq4VfWfjE,And why did Elizabeth Banks put name her this???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Couldn't make it through the trailer so def won't be seeing the movie. Just horrible. Didn't Elizabeth Banks jump the shark 15 years ago? She's just...old.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Audience: How many Clothes & Wigs have you wear in the Movie?
Director: Yes.
Audience: How mu--?
Director: Yes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh lord not another one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The problem here is it should be a TV show, not a movie. This is like Mission Impossible and Star Trek. Translation to the big screen makes it seem shallow."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks who is she?
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one asked for this!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is getting old. Even for some silly show it's getting ridiculous. None of these women could over power any regular male. End of story. They'd get knocked the F out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Leave classics alone. I will NOT acknowledge other angels besides Cameron, Drew , Lucy and Demi"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isn't this the 4th time they're doing this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,YESSS!!!💖💖💖💖💎🌹✌🏻❤💜🙃💘💎
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think Kristen Stewart looks so much better with long hair. Am I the only one?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who els is like OMG WTF?????? Never thought this would happen!!!!! Big Surprise. Looking forward to it but nothing is like the original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They better not make Patrick Stewart the bad guy and have the angels defeat Charlie and become even mot empowered women eurghh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,We want new stories!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna bomb ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,it's lacking something.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is  giving tough competition to bollywood for remake😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like episode from Arrowverse...but in Arrowverse they have actually pretty girls...
RSUq4VfWfjE,No ones talking about princess jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's here because of Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder what amount of the budget was spent on ensuring Kristen Stewart appeared to be capable of expressing emotion.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana's background music😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Naomi Scott* is visually the wrong person for this movie 🤦‍♀️ Kristen Stewart definitely looks like the best part of this film.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ewww they could have picked some other actresses to do this better.  All  I can think of is twilight every time I see her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this is just ""totally spies"" with Patrick Stewart as jerry"
RSUq4VfWfjE,TBH I came to hear Lana Del Rey. I left when I saw Kristen Stewart.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the worst casting I’ve ever seen in a movie remake like this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana yuhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omgosh kristen has gone wild😂😂😂😂 i love it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels without the angels 

...or *Charlie*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristin Stewart as a Charlie’s angel???? Nope, just no. Nope no. She’s like an anorexic example of toxic femininity. Nope. Nooo thanks! Not what a strong confident woman is. 😪😬😬😑😑"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The previous Charlie's Angel's were great. This one is just Feminism being shoved down our throats.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I have to add this move to my “NOT” to watch list with other bad remakes
RSUq4VfWfjE,In my opinion a terrible remake. Kristen Stewart cast as Charlie Angels was a bad decision by Elizabeth Banks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ahh here we go again with the Hollywood feminism thought process of Big burly manly men are bad. 

(I'm sorry but I give a female who is around 120lbs a less then 1% chance in taking down a 300lb+  sucurity specialist by hand.) 🤣

When are they going to figure out this I why box office views are down"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Clichéeeeeeeee!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels...WE HAVE A PROBLEM
RSUq4VfWfjE,"RIP Farrah Fawcett, one of Charlie's original Angels (1947-2009)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish one was Asian
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Instead of remakes it should be passing the torch like Star Wars, have all your favorite characters and new characters."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The trailer was dry, real dry"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Right far as I know Charlie‘s Angels never had a black chick in it not Charlies angels then
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer: Just because you can doesn't mean you should
Me: Then why did you"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else is NOT waiting for this movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not interested
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels sucked in the first place why remake it. Also why can we see Charlie.... You never saw his face in the series.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see Kristen STILL has no control over that weird eye blinking thing she does .... 2:20
RSUq4VfWfjE,So charlie is in charge need not to worry...
RSUq4VfWfjE,It'll be a flop like all the other social justice Warrior
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Everyone watches trailer: Guardians of the sucks
After watching the movie:  satisfied.
After watching CHARLIE'S ANGELS trailer: (everyone) this remake sucks af.
After watching the movie: ( everyone)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Help my sister get a new smile.all proceeds go to her.go to my channel to donate.much love
RSUq4VfWfjE,B grade Movie !!! +BGM +CARS  -REST ALL 😤🙍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t know why the music and the enthusiasm of the characters gives off a cheesy vibe!!!! And it looks like they barely are doing the stunts!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'M PISSED they litterally only gave my baby noah one second of screentime?!@!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm not diggin it sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,i fucking hate reboots down to the core
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:26 Angelina Jolie did it better, Wanted (2008). If you know, you know🤷🏽‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bring me John Wick
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just one question. Whyyyyy????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Remember in the original when the girls were sexy? They didnt remake that in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""I think women can do anything"".... Yh OK..... Let's see a woman beat LeBron in a 1v1"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"None of the actresses seem charismatic or interesting. What I liked about the last Charlie’s Angels is that they each had a distinct personality and vibe to them. But they still worked as a team. 
From this trailer I’m not really getting that feeling"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"as soon as stewart appeared, its dislike and exit (you know, writing this comment in between)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omfg wtf is this
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like three just graduated high school chicks who took time off their professional instagram influencer careers to pretend act being Totally Spies. Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Get WOKE! Go BROKE!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.  Just nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Made for teenage lesbians apparently, full on anti male, it's so brave /s."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.  This is going to tank.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Did i see Raven from ""the 100"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart should have played Captain Marvel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t wait until November to nut over Kristin Stewart :(((((
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart... 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝😗😗😗😗
RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell a flop....
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will suuuuuuck! ...and Bosley is NOT a woman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Question:  Are ""Charlie's Angels"" still working for ""Charlie""?  Is ""Charlie"" still a man?  If yes, can you really call it ""empowering"" to women?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,How about that they somehow made Stewart look hot and actually look alive.
RSUq4VfWfjE,CRINGE
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me, a known wlw, dies from viewing this unprepared"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Other than that initial cringey line this doesnt look too bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Of course, no asian girl. the thing you see even less than black"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im so gay for Kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You deoxygenized his brain stem? 
I don’t think he’s coming back..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just recalled my childhood memories
RSUq4VfWfjE,Starcast not suitable for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If I never saw this movie,  it would be too soon... Should be on regular TV by next week or so."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Banks :Check out the Charlie's angels trailer right now 
BGM : Don't call me ANGEL  .  lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,If Drew Barrymore or Lucy Liu make a cameo in this I’m going to lose my s*it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should change not Charlie's angle but legally blonde 😓
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope not buying it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More antimen stuff.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really? LGBT movie of the year
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh I love all of Kristen Stewart’s looks in this🔥😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,this and the new MIB smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The song, where is the song? the song is very important"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Being in the same universe but with a new generation of angels ISN'T A REMAKE.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ah yes. 

Feminism - again. 

Reboot - again. 

This is guaranteed to fail. 



""I think women can do anything""
Apparently women can't break men's sports records"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart in a lame remake of another lame movie. Gonna save my money, thanks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am excited to watch Naomi Scott once again
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's like hell for me that I only can hear Ariana and Miley.... Where's Lana's voice !?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disaster coming on its way
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nooo, why ruin a classic!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,and the big twist at the end.. Charlie is actually a woman… that could happen now in this film
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yall hating this looks decent idk why yapl following waves with this hate culture
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAH AND NAOMI 😯😯😯😯😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,What is wrong with Hollywood? No more remakes. Stop with the new casting! Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves.
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of the worst things they can do to this movie is overestimate how much these women can manipulate a man purely based on their looks
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have never seen Kristen Stewart smile
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a TV movie.... Not sure if this was the right cast for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For the love of- it's not a remake OR a reboot, it's a continuation that ties the TV show and the previous movies together into one canon. Maybe actually maybe research the thing before complaining about the thing, yeah? You won't get very far in life if you can't do basic fact checking."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This warms my little gay heart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we have original movies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG 😱 I can't wait!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing new
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My question is why...?   This could have been a female Bond movie or a separate ""spy"" movie.  Why Do ""Charlies Angles""???  Can't Hollywood get a brain?  We want great stories!!!      
Ill wait till the reviews come out...  and then choose to give money or waste time on a free down load!!!  With Patrick Stewart and Djimon Hounsou in it, it deserves a watch..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,One Charlie’s angels . *ONE* 👈🏻👉🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought this said chris angle
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley is a woman now, that's sexist lol But on a serious note, this looks mediocre at best"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so excited to watch this movie 🎥😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a TV movie with a bigger budget
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Let's be honest ,at the end of the story,It's a movie that you will watch and you will enjoy watching it and for ruining the story,I see that they didn't but I see that they made it the same"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi? Really?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am all here for the new single from Lana Del Rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks amazing! Definitely going to watch it ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,And the bitches won't stop 😐😐😐!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,its neither Charlie's Angels nor Charlie Chaplin
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah man wtf is this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look. Another feminists wet dream come to life 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,Horsepiss
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I can already tell this movie is gonna suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry but this won’t beat Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz version. Bye."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love how is cool to jump on let's hate this trend, no one is satisfied on 2019."
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's a hard pass for me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought this would be the male reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Someone should have told them they are working with a Vampire.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott😘😘😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imma still watch it 🤷‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,How old are the people complaining about this remake lol no body from my gen really remembers the old Charlie's angles so we don't care about it being different. I'm 23
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nooooo....😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a really bad movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another ""girl power""/misandry film."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to not see it
RSUq4VfWfjE,*yawn*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I prefer the one with drew, cameron and lucy. This looks like they are trying so hard."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen en un ángel???????? WTF??? Que le pasa al mundo? 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,welcome to istanbul 1:30 :turkey:
RSUq4VfWfjE,How do you make Charlie’s angel look feminist asf.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remakes can be great if you stick to the concept that made it a winner.  Don't remove, change or add characters or plot if not absolutely necessary to make it contemporary.  Don't add romance and and a lot of personal baggage that wasn't already there.  Stop making movies to please every demographics - it's a recipe for failure."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh...these angels are hideous.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie made for young woman but sure guys let's hear how much you hate it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,For the longest time I wanted my favorite movie  Back to the future remade. I truly hope they never ever do it. This will most likely be horrible. Would have been better off going with a trilogy and bring bill Murray back as bosley
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yayyyyyy women beating up men, because that's how you make an empowered women's  movie nowadays"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even Bosley as a woman? Feminist film?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why, oh why would they think that kristen Stewart  belongs in this world? Leave her in the movie adaptations of Taylor's swift songs where she belongs."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah I don’t think the original Charlie’s angels mentioned after sentence that they’re women
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This just feels BLAND.. and tends to expose marketing - Audi, Ariana Grande and feels like just another Hollywood crap 😭"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Or... And hear me out here... We skip this movie and wait for something else.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why they always trying to remake old movies? Don't make no sense, I liked the old Charlie's angels trio"
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG I can wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,is it just me or anybody used to fap watching this movie ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why does this look so cheap? :/ 
The music and everything else just doesn't feel right."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else sees Abella Danger ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course it has to have a short haired girl just to meet the quota
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Diversity is our propaganda. 

So brave, so woke."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just came here to see if there was outrage at another remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STERWART!! I can't love you enough!! How can you be so perfect like every time???!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is bad. Like really really bad. Just watching the trailer I’m cringing at how cheesy and what an insult to the original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Regular male cops can’t keep up so they sent three women to save the world, sounds reasonable 🤘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,so when is the single dropping
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cancer cast, cancer plot.... CANCER MOVIE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Womenpowerrrrrrrrrr
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bored
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omg I’m gonna give this a chance, the last reboot was iconic maybe this will beeee"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In the beginning the only thing I could think of was:
Disney Channel is shook"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't like it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,To much reboots movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Of Course Bosley is a woman, becuase they didn't have enough estrogen with 3 women. Why don't you make Charlie a woman?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"😕I didn't know Christine Stewart was still acting, It been a while."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this looks horrriiiibbblleee!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else remember the awful GameCube game?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No I liked the Charlie's Angels with Cameron Diaz,Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanna see an AirWolf remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only thing I got out of this trailer ,was that Kristen Stewart looks soooo much better with longer hair in the first scene.  Other than that .....nothing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Song is more interesting than the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Check out the Charlie's Angels trailer right now!"" < WTF do you think I'm doing, dumb blonde? The way trailers work is you clink on it and the trailer plays! When a waiter brings you your meal, does he have to specify you're suppose to eat it?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't see it as a remake and it looks pretty cool. I'm interested. 
Also really curious for Kristen Steward, seems like the character suits her."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mast
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Kristen Stewart ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks so terrible. 



Also Elizabeth Banks, we get it, it's your movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is why cinema is dying
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want to like this but I just don't. Something is not right, it might be the cast."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love Kristen Stewart and was excited for this but yeaaaaah, it’s a no for me dawg."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry for being the negative person but saw Kristen Stewart and thought nope..I hope her acting is better than it was from the Twilight series
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems more like a Netflix film than a theatrical one
RSUq4VfWfjE,ugh~ you fuckers in the comment section takes things way too seriously. every wonder this is pure entertainment??? films are meant to distract you for like 2 hours... and it doesnt hurt to see new faces in old stories. *eye roll*
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This makes Black Panther look like a masterpiece
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 the year of rehashing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is destined for the bargian bin.
RSUq4VfWfjE,my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had to put it on mute...the music was too much
RSUq4VfWfjE,Taylor Swift: Bad Blood 2
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yet another strong, powerful, smart, educated, independent, don’t need a man, feminist to wake the 40 year old white man movie... you go girl!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so boooring.
RSUq4VfWfjE,At best it’s a YouTube movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was just here for the lana, miley, and ari collab lmao. Idek what this movie is"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t do this without that one girl. dang what’s her name...from Shaft; that Storm actress & some fantastic comedy writing. this is a standard cast at best. recycled stuff will not get my money
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ew gah, it's Kristen Stewart"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen look so cool here! I honestly can't wait for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sux
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isn't there anything new instead?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y'all need to calm down.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sponsored by audi
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's sad but I think this is going to be just like the new ghost busters movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Similar to when they took Julie in to become an Angel back in season 5. It'd be hilarious if the Angel that just retired was Dylan! She always believed she'd grow old in the agency.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lots of ethnics. I will pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kingsman feminist edition looks lit .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop beating the dead horse Hollywood....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disliked
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love it - Charle's Angels. This version is just The Kingsmen. And, cause I'm just here for the entertainment escapism of pure fiction. Nothing else."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I got one word:








garbage"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so forced. it even has a dance sequence. and the best 3 spies in the world are 20-something hot girls. with smarts. and attitude(TM).
RSUq4VfWfjE,Men really hate female lead films huh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Payback ladies
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really hope this won’t be another crazy SJW-type movie like 95% of what Hollywood’s been producing lately.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like so much fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am waiting for release this movie😍😘.movie trailer is awesome👍💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aren’t they supposed to be attractive. To progressive
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I actually want to see this. People are so miserable and always so quick to bash and judge something. If I like it I like it. If I don’t like it? Oh well, at least I gave it a shot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does Patrick Stewart need money so desperately? Seems like another SJW dumpster fire.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks cringey af.... it’s like Hobbs and Shaw, Feminist edition 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The Original Angels: Jaclyn Smith (Kelly Garrett), Farrah Fawcett (Jill Munroe), Kate Jackson (Sabrina Duncan).... Not forgetting David Dole as John Bosley"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Still a better love story than Twilight. 
Wait... what?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana I can't hear you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omg please stop remaking everything. Be creative, come up with your own movies! Pathetic!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imma just say it till i haven’t seen it why is it that the riverdale ppl and that guy in like literally every movie like I’m sorry if I offend y’all who ever like “Stan’s” they but like kinda getting tired of seeing them in every movie

RSUq4VfWfjE,The worst trailer ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just like Aladdin don't judge a movie by its trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Y'all already know this is a hit when you see Christen,Naomi and Noah in one screen."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is the definition of resting b*tch face...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The brainwashed Millennial generation has nothing to call their own , they regurgitate the culture of the past and try to call it their own . They are a sad and lost generation , being told that they are special , but not being able to create ideas of their own ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'd never thought I'd ever say this... this series needs McG back
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Three naturallly badass women😎

RSUq4VfWfjE,But did they replace the asian one with a white girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't know why but the trailer feels very 90's like bad 90's movie soundtrack and all
RSUq4VfWfjE,Owhh princess Jasmine.. i love it!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It is ok, it is ok.
IT IS NOT OK, *IT IS NOT OK.*"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow so many strong women and silly weak men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Female version of kingsman, I guess."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The trailer made for McG's CHARLIE'S ANGELS (2000), despite being dated and cheesy, looks yet far more entertaining and like fun then this one."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tv Serie? 😨
RSUq4VfWfjE,My only problem with this is Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks directing it AND starring in it? No thanks. Wasn't a fan of Power Rangers...

RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does trending suk so bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Хрень. Голливуд не вывозит. В девчонках нет харизмы. Шерлиз Терон круче этих троих на несколько позиций. Тухлятина.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok, ok, looks ok, not great but.... 

* Patrick Stewart walks in* 

SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,La esencia de Charlie's Angels es la sensualidad y sexualidad que desprenden sus protagonistas... Estas parecen todas unas lesbianas anoréxicas no me gusta... La única que medio se salva es Naomi
RSUq4VfWfjE,it is not a remake but a new gen of charlies angels....keep up with the news guys.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remakes suck & ""girl power"" movies always feel like they try to hard. HOWEVER I have some hope with Elizabeth Banks writing and directing."

RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks exactly like a thought a 2019 Charlie's Angels would look like....pandering woke bullshit targeted at the lowest common denominator.  

You should be offended and not happy about this garbage.  Hollywood thinks you're so stupid you'll eat this crap up purely based on politics.  It's low effort garbage."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just here because of Ariana grande who else?😂🙋🏼‍♀️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,is this the new Audi LGBTQ Trailer ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Umm?   Hollywood must be using empty headed writers these days .LOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Agent Bullock?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm I thought Bosley was a guy? I’m guessing the fims don’t want to be bossed by a man. Ok I’ll for HBO to get it
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 those clothes are reference from the old movie or should i say Easter egg from the previous movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where is the chemistry of the original angels ??? Poor Jill, Kelly and Sabrina ... Bosley woman ??? We've even had Demmi Moore, fantastic but these three, no way !!! ... it's more like baby angels, and Kristen Stewart's constipation face never leaves her ... Sorry Charlie. 😞😞😞"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Destinys childs song independent women better be in the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:42 - Picard describing his trademark wine.

RSUq4VfWfjE,honestly this looks cool. I loved the original Charlie's Angels movies so I'm excited for them to turn a new generation of girls gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was expecting the dislikes to overtake the likes, maybe too early?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did they replace the Asian
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s Cameron Diaz????!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This was bad. The Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu reboot was so much better!"

RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm like the only person who wants to watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just here for the Ariana Grande/Lana Del Rey/Miley Cyrus collab.
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG!!! Leave this alone why don't ya!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh no, a new Ghostbusters movie with... wait what?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The likes are clearly bought out. Elizabeth, I thought better of you than this... Totally not original, and it just seems cheap"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I could respect this movie a little bit more if they have this movie as a 3rd installment as suppose to a reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't hear Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why does ""almost"" everybody leave a bad comment about this movie? I think it's gonna be great, and I love the casts ☺"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The carotids don't supply the brainstem.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanna make a youtube video in the future.
RSUq4VfWfjE,She really Disney channeled that logo XD
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart Cant act
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The anti woke /Jordan Peterson followers /right wing zealots will read way too much into this and see it as feminists propaganda.

The feminists will see it as disrespectful to women. And not woke enough.

YouTube has become so radicalized😂😂

My opinion is it looks pretty bad. The first movie was a fun watch though even if it was bad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fiscally & mentally, ""Man"" are Superior to women."

RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey it’s Bella and the pink ranger
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't know if it's just me but it looks like really fake acting. And the song choice super boring.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If society ""collapsed"" Men would rebuild it.

Not women"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks atrocious
RSUq4VfWfjE,Peter Kavinsky❤💘💖💕

This is gonna be ghostbusters all over again."
RSUq4VfWfjE,you can always tell when the director is a woman.  its like a female comedian who jokes about nothing but her period
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like the Walmart version of Kingsmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love the trailer and I can't wait to see what Elizabeth did with the concept! It's exciting!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood: We can remake anything we want to. 
Everyone else: Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Женская мизогиния вышла на новый уровень, растоптав все идеалы некогда популярных Ангелов.  Голливуд, остановись..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who wants to bet that the film will flop. Ha🤣

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, joy another boring ""badass"" chick flick, so much original, so much excite! I wonder if the women are going to beat up a bunch of bigger, taller, physically stronger men..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I honestly don't know how I feel about this.. I guess we shall see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Let’s see how many “Charlie’s Angels” are there? 1976–81, 89, 98, 2000, 2001,  2003 twice , 2011. And now 2019. SOOO ORIGINAL!! fucking Hollywood is lazy!"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo 😩🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't know why there are so many negative comments, what's the problem? Each movie has it's audience.   Not every movie can be original and oscar worthy, just relax and just enjoy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ooh, it looks like the SJW got their claws around another movie. Maybe they'll finally shut up and quit bitching about every movie that's not up to their standards."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Ranger Pink follow the Rita Repulsa ways at the end. Nice one Sony :')
RSUq4VfWfjE,hollywood will you fix Sonic the hedgehog's teeth? you ruined my childhood dream.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Omgggg!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so weird. I was just thinking about Charlie’s angels this morning. Didn’t think they would actually do this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old charlies angel was better. it was like watching batman joker heath ledger. This one totally okay with new twlight character.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No esperaba ver a Javi noble en esta peli jajaja va a estar buena 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Did we need this? Can we go back to quality and less on franchises. I get the nostalgia, but I'm tired of seeing these reboots of reboots of the original reboot. Next!"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"The Mummy without Rachel Weiz (was it right?) Is disappointing
And now THIS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wonder they finally meet Charlie or not in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,2.18 she so cute~~~
RSUq4VfWfjE,"oh look another lets put more ''diversities'' and shove it down peoples throat remake movie, they look no where near badass original actresses"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a load of bollocks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sighhhhhhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hollywood going to make anything original anymore? Or all just remakes....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"picks up mints
*smacks out of hand 3 feet high*
"" *SoMe oF ThESe BlOw uP* """
RSUq4VfWfjE,Short hair? Don’t care! Yawn
RSUq4VfWfjE,Usually I would be looking forward to watching this movie but for some reason I’m not. Idk why.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels 2000 poops all over this pretender.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angles or Charles's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Stop watching this crap. Making movies to remind us to be diverse. We get it. Women are strong, black, white, mixed, Asian. Got it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy Liu, with my girl Drew, Cameron D and Destiny. Charlie’s angels come on."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait to see this!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look like clowns over convincing fighting agents
RSUq4VfWfjE,"hollywood ruined my childhood dream. Sonic Hedgehog CGI.....  But I feel sorry for all charlie angel fans out there. This charlie angels ruined your dream. lol. hahahahah.
twlight saga meets xmen meets blingbling"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It was so bad that it gave me cancer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is noah centipede here
RSUq4VfWfjE,Honestly... this looks amazing. And I never thought I'd say that about anything with Kristen Stewart in it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So stoked for this!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,How about they actually come up with a new movie idea rather than remaking a movie that doesn't need to be remade???
RSUq4VfWfjE,YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS 🤗🤗🤗 this made my day.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am only here for naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If you really loved the Original, this one really wouldn’t ruin it *IF* it’s bad. Each of the new Angels is phenomenal in their own way. Kristen brought out Bella Swan so well that people associate Bella’s glumness with Kristen herself. Naomi is a *gorgeous* sensational singer. Hey Guys, give love not hate! Nuff said!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they have to remake everything? The 2000's version was perfectly fine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Destiny's Child reunion?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,previous two movies of charlies angel were great.This one looks like boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:15 The carotid doesn't even supply the brain stem so boo already
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jumping Jesus, this looks awful."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow   , New Angels Are Comingg"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nooo...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really excited to watch this film😍😍😘😘😘😘😄😄😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF....what a laughing stock. YAAAKKSS
RSUq4VfWfjE,woompa lompa angel's HAHAHAHAHAHA
RSUq4VfWfjE,yaay girl power woo...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disaster of the year-confirmes
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Girls in this movie are simply not attractive but I guess that's just my opinion....
RSUq4VfWfjE,RIP
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I always really wanted a Charlie’s Angel’s 3 with Cameron, Lucy, and Drew.... 😔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
Revelation 20:14-15"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Twilight girl needs to grow her hair back
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so lazy from Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,I really wish they would put women who look like they could handle themselves instead of women who look like they barely weigh 100 lbs.  I don't mean fatties.  Some women like boxer Rhonda Russey.  Women with some freaking MUSCLE on their arms.  The scene where the twilight chick is hitting the Asian guy's face with her elbow....not reality her arm has no weight behind it to deliver a hit !!  Also I don't like liberal Elizabeth Banks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Con este tráiler me di cuenta que no es que algunas películas son malas es que nosotros pedimos mucho más ya hemos visto muchas películas queremos historias nuevas pero con la misma esencia de la anterior ( si es un reinicio como este) pero a la ves buscamos personalidades independientes a las que ya vimos en la anteriores películas yo digo que esta peli será buena pero así de modo normal causal nada impactante y no por culpa de las actrices ni el guion ni nada sino de nosotros y nuestras exigencias ya que cada ves la, competencia aumenta más y exigimos más por ello"
RSUq4VfWfjE,hahahahahahaha wtf!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,More 3ed wave feminist garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fun fact: check out 1:44 where it showed their clothes hung up, those are 2 outfit on the original 2000 movie worn by one of the original angel's, Cameron Diaz. One at the race car scene and the other at the guy's house when they went to sing to him with the instruments as they were getting his eye print."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here only because of Noah
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Espero a participação da Ariana no filme. Quem sabe ela é o ""tcharle"". Hmmm"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WOW does that suck. Elizabeth Banks, you're better than this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They checked every box in the PC column.  That's cool.  Not for me, but, hey.....different strokes for different folks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I loved the original and I’m sure I’ll love this remake. I’m pumped!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks and kristen Stewart. This gonna be a bad movie.. i think they needed an asian girl apart of this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,When will Sony stop putting the entire movie into a trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its a no for me big dog
RSUq4VfWfjE,Maybe my sister will watch this. This is too gay for me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that the reboot pink power ranger and villain ?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow surprise. Another remake no one asked for. How original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They’ll gender-swap anything, except if it’s the other way around"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ai, meu Deus! Muito bom! Ariana, uau!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sir Patrick Stewart as one of the Bosleys?? I can dig that - he's a badass no matter role he portrays.  I'm not much of a Kristen Stewart fan though.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm loving this!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The soundtrack is off the hook
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn.. the moment I saw kristen I knew this will not live up to my expectations. None of them look 'iconic', they all look like college girls trying to film a high school movie about to change the game rules over at college campuses... did that make any sense?? No? Well know you know how I felt bout this...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I see not a single positive comment here, but i can bet this movie is gonna be a huge commercial success !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Staaaaaaaaaap!!! Whhhhhhhy?!?! Leave it alone... ;^;
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eh...I'd watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Remakes of remakes. Hollywood is creatively bankrupt. If a script isnt a pre existing franchise they toss it in the trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott is coming🤣🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,can yall come up with some new ideas? for fucks sake this is getting ridiculous
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yay another feminist movie. YAY HOLLYWOOD CASHIING OUT ON PC CULTURE AND JUST RUINING A MOVIE BY OVERLOADING IT WITH PC THEMES. YAYYYYAYAYA
RSUq4VfWfjE,"did we asked for this? nope
did we even think Charlie's angels gonna have a remake? nope


exactly..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Running out of ideas?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A lot of y’all are like: *”I’m gonna watch the OG with Drew, Cameron, and Lucy.”*

THE REAL OGs ARE FARRAH, KATE, and JACLYN!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is obnoxious.
RSUq4VfWfjE,These movie women are getting uglier.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh look!
 Another Box Office Poison movie..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did Kristen Stewart just try to steal Sansa’s line from Dark Phoenix trailer?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They really replaced the asian with a black woman? I guess Lucy Liu wasn't diverse enough?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They don’t like boys so no boys watching this movie 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I haven’t seen Kristin in a long time glad she back
RSUq4VfWfjE,One word. BOMB!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Charlies Painful to watch...
RSUq4VfWfjE,eu tinha visto no Twitter.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like trash 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wtf. Nobody asked for this.
I'm glad for all the girl power movies. But still. Wtf.


EDIT: GUYS, THE ORIGINAL MOVIES WERE TERRIBLE. SHUT UP."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im happy that Kristen is Back in the Big Screen...👏👏👏but Im gonna Miss the Original Casts of Charlie's Angels...😢
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍kristen is my female crush❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ouch 😭🤯😪😭😌
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hate it
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s very transparent what they are trying to do here
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lmao even Bosley is a woman. Hollywood and their obsession with making everything about women is so obvious and embarrassing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Eeehh..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worst film of 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,"@1:44 2 familiar costumes from charlies angels 2000, worn by drew, lucy and cameron"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naw thanks unknown lil girls i wont watch that bullshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be lesb8an movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks bad! 🤦🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:

Absolutely Nobody:

Hollywood: let's make a Charlie's Angels remake."
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY IS BOSLEY A WOMAN??!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,They running outta ideas
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart, Noah centineo and Naomi scott
What an odd combination 🤔but interesting"
RSUq4VfWfjE,C R I N G E
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Most people here suddenly are swooning over Kristen Stewart... All of you have been missing out, she's been awesome."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to watch it on Tbs 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohhhhh... No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Also Sabina? Anyone remember the SNL skit with Kristen Stewart, Vanessa and the Totinos. Her name was Sabine lol I have a feeling Kristen had a say in her characters name or it's just a coincidence"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this trailer is all over the place...
RSUq4VfWfjE,What annoys me the most in the trailer is how she grabs the mints and then the guy Smacks them from her hand and says don't touch some of these things blows up.  WHY WOULD YOU SMACK IT THEN
RSUq4VfWfjE,"New side of kristen stewart acting ehh? Not bad, not bad"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:
Hollywood: Let’s reboot another film."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism at its worst
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sjw women bullshit. They never learn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I felt like this was less of a trailer and more like a promo for the music by Ariana Granda, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Ray :/"
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even when she hits that guy her face does not change at all.... HOW
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is going to be boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Literally the only reason I’m gonna watch this is for Naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think the original 3 are legends but who knows, maybe this new gen. can  continue the rich legacy of this film so let's see💞💞"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Would be better if they focused this into an actual series
RSUq4VfWfjE,"you mean Charles Angels from XMen

ops Princess Jasmine from Aladdin"
RSUq4VfWfjE,What an insult to the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm not saying it's bad

But it's not needed"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Moment of silence for the executive who greenlit this project. Hopefully they find other employment.
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like sony is throwing money away .........
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well at least we finally got a Black Angel 💋✊🏽
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel conflicted. Love how professor X over here is Charlie. I'm down for that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I never get tired of Charlie's Angels ... and its many reincarnations.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So...  Charlie's Angels goes Kingsmen...
Oh, Elizabeth (wrote, directed, stars)...   I'm not angry... just very disappointed..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Which queue do I join to get my 2 minutes and 53 seconds back?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awe so cute.. Another strong self empowered female movie. How adorable these 90 pound girls beating up 250-350 pound men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another boring formulaic 'guys with guns' movie... but with gals. It's basically Sex and the City but with guns. I guess if you're a Charlie's Angels fan this could be enticing. Otherwise, meh."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mixed feelings about this  but I will say that Elizabeth Banks is the hottest Woman in the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WOW how many ways can you say this sucks? Women beating up trained male bodyguards, female headbutts!, awful dialogue, nonsensical feminist agendas , one of the most overrated and wooden actresses ever Kirsten Twilight eyelashes and the shittest popstar of all-time, Ariana Grande. Congratulations Sony, you SUCK!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,You'd think they make Charlie a woman. On well. Missed opportunity 2019.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't like it already,  makes me sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh this movie is just totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are we remaking another thing yet again???? And where is the asian girl??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really another remake! How many times are they going to remake it?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Самое пиздатое здесь,это audi r8"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks sooo bad, but Kristen looks sooo hot I may have to watch it nonetheless..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has become a totally feminist crap movie with a lame feminist agenda ! disappointing !
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't beat old school
RSUq4VfWfjE,Most stupid girls on earth.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now I can't get this though out of my mind:
Princess Jasmine is a spy🤯🤯"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why couldn't we get a third Cameron, Drew and Lucy Film?!! This sucks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,tf i thought miley ariana and lana del rey were the new charlies angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,l am here because of Kristen Stewart ily💞❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just IMDB’ed this movie, there are 3 Bosleys in this movie; how is that gonna work? Elizabeth Banks, Patrick Stewart, and Djimon Hounsou are all credited as “Bosley” I seriously thought Patrick Stewart was going to be playing Charlie in this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still waiting for a strong black women to take the lead
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Charlie's Angels>>>>Ocean 8*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks better than i thought
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Charlie's Angels>>>>Ocean 8*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Also, how does this have 53k positive likes when every comment is negative?🤔🤔🤔🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is sexist.  At least of the Angel's should be a man.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That guy looks like VuJ from Copa 90. Is he ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"After 3
Cmon everyone... 1, 2,
GET WOKE, GO BROKE. GET WOKE, GO BROKE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"okkk , just hit the dislike button , the only reason that i watched this video was elizabeth banks ,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,really?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,The cringe is strong with this trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie might flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nope. MCG films are still legit. No Cam, Drew or Lucy, NO DEAL."
RSUq4VfWfjE,트레일러만 봐도 좆노잼이라 느낀거는 오랜만이네
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh sweet. More feminist bullshit being forced down our throat.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Farrah going to do a cameo?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Destiny's Child version vs Ariana, Miley & Lana version...

Who's song is better?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0.55 thats aug 83
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mmmmmmmmmmm idk
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop killing movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another, remake."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, the franchise just got sh!t on with this garbage...  WTF are they thinking about? That's right, they weren't thinking!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will watch it for sexy Kristen Stewart & cute Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Does not look convincing. The first reboot was cute, tongue-in-cheek, and played with no limits. These three look like they're ""trying"" to be tough. Get some bodybuilder and ballet babes up in here!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn! Kristen is on fire! And that's actually the only thing I saw from this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Short blonde hair lesbian beating up male twice her size (check), female lead programmer (check), programme to solve Climate-Change (check) - AND SOOOOOOOO many more SJW tropes. Hollywood is an indoctrination machine!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OK, most of the movie looks like it could be fun, if you don't take it seriously, But I just can't get past the CRINGE of Kristen Stewart. This is not a role for her."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"To those born in the Fortnite era, this is just a remake. Such a movie existed before in the early 2000s."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Going to see Anna this weekend and now I have this to look forward to in November!! Ahhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Charles angles are back babby
RSUq4VfWfjE,The action sequences don't look that great but the acting seems truly amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,well I thought the director said that this movie will not focus on boyfriends and sexuality but it looks like that they throw the story out of the window for sex
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course they got a black chick. That’s cultural appropriation.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like it
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Kings Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw Kristen Stewart and I was like HARD PASS 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,You are my totino.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is born to have that long blonde hair damn 🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Charlie's Angel's are just the same as kingsmen now?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are they roping Sir Patrick into this bullshit.
RSUq4VfWfjE,reading comments and finding out people still hate k stew and/or making 'expressionless' jokes about her in 2019 like it wasnt essentially a deliberate attack on her person and pictures of her smiling wouldnt sell...yikes...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok the song though 
ARIANA 
MILEY 
LANA 

WOW"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:27 “ you named my daughter AFTER THE *lochness monster* “
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will flop! Zero excitement !  I love how that Ella Ballinsky girl looks though. She looks hot but wont save it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu, they were best..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yall need to stop with all the hate, it’s a reboot, enjoy both"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Mooooore strong female leads.  And diversity.  

Well a new idea would not hurt.   Hollywood shitting out another forgettable turd.  


Ps if they are called Charlie’s angels but the ghetto themed soundtrack says don’t call me angel are they instead “Charlie’s Gender Fluid biracial strong lgbtq... white bad guy hating females”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not even Elizabeth Banks, Djimon Hounsou and Patrick Stewart can get me to watch a Kristen Stewart movie.  Sorry."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They just remaking everything now smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew Barrymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the token Asian? Sony you are racist!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guarantee this movie will suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sometimes I forget he can walk.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who are these girls? Lol. The last angels we all knew them.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why didn’t they cast Cardi B?😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So another remake. And charlies angels to boot. If this movie flops, sjw's comes screaming and then blames it on the men. Again!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow no Asian representation... The original Charlie's Angels are better!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jasmine, is that you?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:25  *Juan Guaido!...* 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,What are you doing princess jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?! Didn't Hollywood learn anything when the TV show reboot flopped last year?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this movie really necessary ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didn’t realize how much I miss Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Please don't go WOKE, please don't go WOKE, pleeeeeease!!!!! That very first line in the trailer scared me!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Charlie’s angels in training? Is it just me or do they lack the maturity that the other trios had?? That X factor
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nooooo! Anybody but Kristen Stewart please!!! 🤣🤣😂😂...please no disappointments! I love Drew, Lucy, And Cameron in the previous Charlie Angels movies!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is only happening because of 2019 they’re has to be a woman impowerment movie for some reason
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like Elizabeth Banks, but did we really need another remake of a remake? It's time for Hollywood to start showing us some more original films."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am wahmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Me seeing people judge the movie before it even comes out
RSUq4VfWfjE,So we just gonna remake classics but fill them with mind numbing BS now huh?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope Charlie is the evil one so they can kill him in the end and symbolize the end of the white patriarchy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charles angels died.... this as wholes
 Murdered....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes!!! Baby. Women taking over Hollywood!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,thats gonna be awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All 3 ex Charlie Angels should have special appearance in the movie otherwise, this will be disappointing...I am missing Drew 💕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,IDK
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters remake version 2.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Let's see remake a TV show remove beauty, and only have males be bad guys and bosley is a woman ok enjoy your flop."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Love from iraq ❤


Where are you from guys 😂❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Incase you didn't know this features a new song by some people... You know the millions times it told us in the one trailer might not have been enough.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did Hollywood forget that they could make original movies? 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think this looks great! First reboot in a while I'm actually looking forward too
RSUq4VfWfjE,While I will always choose new original movies over reboots and this actually wasn’t that bad of a trailer sure Kristen is garbage and the dialogue is a bit cheesy but the action and editing was pretty awesome meh I think I’ll file this one under ‘cheesy action reboot’ and maybe check it out
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Casting Department for this movie should never hold a job again in Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Its 3rd movie is about to out..



Finally charlie's angels.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have never seen the original movie, but this movie feels like a propaganda trying to push lgbt onto us."
RSUq4VfWfjE,FLOP FLOP
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm... What??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Girl power, feminism, Omg I am terribly bored. Pass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks so out of place in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No Asian Charlie's angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dunno man. I can't even get myself to finish this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing beats Cameron, Drew, and Lucy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People always bitching about “Hollywood isn’t original anymore.” While simultaneously ignoring all the great and original indie movies that are released yearly. 

It’s like people just want to hate on something because it has links to an older movie. 

Y’all tripping if y’all think that the older/recent (Lui/Diaz/Barrymore) movies were somehow flawless. Those movies were okay. But not untouchable. 

I’ll watch this movie because it looks funny and exciting."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood Producer : Get me a big name actress with charisma to carry our new action blockbuster reboot..
Nobody : Kristen Stewart"
RSUq4VfWfjE,IT'S TIME TO STOP
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My favorites Lana Del Rey, Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus 😍😍😍😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think, the world isn't ready for another Charlies Angles reboot. What they should have done was make this a Totally Spies live action movie. It would have been WAY better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:03 Why isn't anyone talking about Noah??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Haters gon' hate! This looks awesome. Everything looks great. We need a movie like this right now....stuck-up twilight bitches need some versatility in their lives. K-stew be slayingggggggggg....🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHEN JS THE SONG COMING OUUUUTTTTT???????
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMGGGGGGG IM SOOOO EEXCITEDDDDD
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m a badass beauty who still has a need to be objectified and exploited. Don’t stand in my way when I’m making white men richer and not helping the cause I’m pretending to be a mascot for.
RSUq4VfWfjE,remakes are not the problem. bad remakes are the problem.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had insomnia... this trailer fixed that 💤💤💤 thnx
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope it doesn’t flop like men in black 4
RSUq4VfWfjE,_So yall just gonna act like this didnt happen already?_
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see Jasmine out there but... Where's Aladdin
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems like they butchered the franchise
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Trailer starts with virtue signalling (not the Elizabeth Banks part). Thanks, I am out."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noaaaaah Centinio😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uh weren’t Charlie’s angels sexy and kickass I’m getting nothing here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a complete absolute joke...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 it's about time
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just wanna say one thing Kristen destroyed herself after the breakup ik she is really hurt but shows it like she doesn't care but she does
RSUq4VfWfjE,are we NOT going to talk about how hot Kristen Stewart is in this movie-
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why they use terminator fonts
RSUq4VfWfjE,The thumbnail look like they are fake running for a poster
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kingswomen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Everybody: Original content?
Hollywood: We don’t do that around here."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What is going on?!  

Kristen Stewart showing some personally."
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's funny how men never have to themselves that they're powerful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This trailer is all over the place. Also the potato face with a mop for hair was a ""cute nerd""?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:16 This is how Bella Swan should’ve acted 10 years ago.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart acting as someone other than herself Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?? But what about Patrick Stewart playing someone other than Charles or Captain Kirk?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony Pictures seems abolutely determined to commit hara-kiri!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Kristen Stewart is so hot in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one asked for this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to suck. Maybe if it was called something else like spy kids 4 it might have chance.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WAMEN!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kinda reminds me of Kingsman but shittier
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙅‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,haha sure flop. looks boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:41 is he the guy from X men the old Charles 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I actually like this
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop remaking remakes of movies. Just stop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is the straight to DVD live action movie of totally spies but worse 
also Kristen Steward is such a horrible actress"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah. Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg! Can people stop judging a movie by its trailer?? 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look like lesbians
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chris Pang is “off the entire radar” fine!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just dont think kristen Stewart was right choice LOVE THE ORIGINALITY HAHAHAHAHAHA A NEW IDEA IN HOLLYWOOD IS FAR AND FEW ......THIS IS A EPIC FAIL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Man their recycling franchise movies oh my goodness what are we doing. create something new 🤦‍♂️

RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Twilight girl, Aladdin girl and .....?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible song for an action trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters reboot meet Charlie’s Angels reboot....
RSUq4VfWfjE,FLOP
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pure Hollywood garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,TWILIGHT meets X men meets another movie that shouldnt have been rebooted 😅. Why cant they just leave a perfectly OG movie alone plus iF they were deciding to reboot atleast get the right cast!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wonderful beauties!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin Stewart of not Charlie's angels material...
RSUq4VfWfjE,don't call me angel ......❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is princess jasmine so far from home
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here only for n because of Lana del darling! 💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,Very cool film 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"kristen stewart? ariana grande? lana del rey? YES 🤤👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌

miley cyrus? noooo 🤢👎👎👎👎👎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who edited this trailer?? The music track is a mess
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh GAWD!!! Really!!!? Who the F asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I prefer the old one😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cancelled.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Charles downgrade angels lmao ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,noah sedimentary is just in EVERY damn movie wth 💀
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hate the soundtrack 🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woman empowerment ✊✊
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmm
RSUq4VfWfjE,The main lead casts doesn’t work with the whole movie ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Losing money is ALWAYS unfashionable
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's not ideal but it looks VASTLY better then I expected. Immeasurably better then the all female Ghostbusters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ooooooo Drew Barrymore  watched dis series for uuuuu. I'm gona miss u
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of em's gay. How predictable
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not sure I understand the casting...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope theres at least ONE cameo by  Jaclyn Smith, Kate Jackson, Cherl Ladd, Tanya Roberts, Or Shelly Hack! R.I.P. Farrah😥..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid .....lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart showed more expressions in this trailer than she did in her entire career. 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,We need a cameo from the OG Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:

Absolutely No one:


Patrick Stewart: FIESTY!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like it was made a decade ago
RSUq4VfWfjE,What’s this?! Pitch perfect as James bond?!? Looks worse than ghostbusters
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This honestly looks horrible. The cast is, meh."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well theres a movie waiting to be hated.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing will top the original angels 
Lucy Liu 
Cameron Diaz 
Drew Barrymore 
❤️❤️❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original is still the best ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44  the racecar outfit and the dress were from the 1st Charlie's Angel's movies. & 2:53 was the white snow outfit Cameron wore in the 2nd movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't believe no one knew that it was Noah Centineo
RSUq4VfWfjE,This must be CHARLIES ANGELS II!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had to go watch the old angels Cameron Diaz Lucy Lui and drew Barrymore to take the effects of this off. :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,who else was waiting for the original theme and feels violently disappointed?
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHAT
RSUq4VfWfjE,bottoms we're streaming thissss
RSUq4VfWfjE,Produced by Audi.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man, these comments seem really negative towards this trailer. I'm iffy, but I don't really hate the idea so far. Music choice wasn't that great, but other than that, it doesn't look terrible."
RSUq4VfWfjE,LANA STANS WHERE Y'ALL ATTTTT
RSUq4VfWfjE,An empty movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Juan carlos
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,i only like the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like a low budget tv series. Why would you go see this in cinema? 

Also. Originality is dead and buried."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will definitely watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG Ariana kill it! Love she!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s the “Totally Spies!”Movie nobody asked for in the form of Charlie’s angels lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let's remake every movie ever made so we can move on...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The black girl is the only hot one, the other two are just sort of bland and boring, the casting director was lousy!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringeworthy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is offense.  Why a reboot with women? Why not with men, this is horrible and a disgrace to equality.   I hope it fails.  Men are people too.  And why are ""angels""  always women?  Elizabeth Banks is anti-man.  Pitch Perfect is a prime example."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I expect the cameo of 'old' trio charlies angel 😞
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like this is gonna suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where are there Ari 🖤?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh thought that was kat gragham 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hear some songs of miley and ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood needs to stop making the same movies over and over, the one with Drew Barrymore was already a reboot of the Charlie's Angels show. Make something original ffs"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well. They're absolutely not Charles Angels at all. Bad choice
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin Stewart's so pretty
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There is no way in hell those girls will beat Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu or Drew Barrymore, no way, never! 

Don't believe me? Go watch the Charlies Angels 2000 trailer and tell me I'm wrong. 

Some movies just do not need to be remade."
RSUq4VfWfjE,No more new ideas?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Let’s admit it we’re just watching this for the Lana, Ariana, and Miley collab"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana...the voice 😭😭😭 omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More jump cuts in the action scenes then a Liam Neeson movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana...the voice 😭😭😭 omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is bad!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why do i feel like this one's gonna flop at the box office ?
Like the ghostbuster female version"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh
RSUq4VfWfjE,That is a hard pass to the right.  Elizabeth Banks should have passed on this one.  She is an awesome actress.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is kristen Stewart the first choice here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I would have hoped in the 2019 equality drive, we'd have seen Charlize's mAngels...Alas not."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is chinese ??????
RSUq4VfWfjE,R they dudes like all the rest lol how disgusting .....
RSUq4VfWfjE,When I look at these Pre-Teen Non Athletic badasses I know the world is a safer place.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was going to complain because it's a remake of a remake, but then... I realized how much stuff is in the trailer and am concerned there's no focus in the film. Atomic Blonde does it better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,When  there's no Asian main character it's boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This just feels wrong .
Charlie's Angels should have been left alone really 🙄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ghost busters,man in black now this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie should be titled - ""Charlie's BITCHES""."
RSUq4VfWfjE,CRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGE...
RSUq4VfWfjE,foda
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s my Lucy Liu at???????
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess that's gonna be a fail
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disappointed there's no East Asian rep.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When i saw Charlie’s angles I was like, oooo my grandma would like this! But then I found out that it’s some weird reboot"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Introducing the new member isn’t exactly the plot I wanted (the rookie learning the ropes can be cheese), but it looks flashy and fun so I’ll keep my hopes up!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,waiting
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already feel this is gonna suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,But why?????????
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm not surprised people are shooting on the street after watching such movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't Hollywood think of anything original?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love that Elizabeth banks but her name in the trailer when she directed but not Patrick Stewart because it's an all female lead movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess the rights were about to run out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aaawwwhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m still going to see it, But nothing beats the original... I love me some Drew Barrymore"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another dull reboot with crap actresses. No thanks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh looks lame I won't be watching.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Awesome, yet another multi cultural, skank directed train wreck."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Alright! Not gonna watch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this that one JonTron video
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I cannot judge this trailer, I could not see it for more than 30 sec."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noooooo they ruined it with twilight chick
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*I'm so excited for this movie. Three amazing lead actresses, with Elizabeth Banks and Patrick Stewart? Looks amazing already!*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So the best bit about that trailer was Sir Patrick Stewart.
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:50 abella danger?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old is gold is not only a saying 😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not hot enough.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh. Cringe. The year of feminism continues. We already had Charlie's Angels. Hollywood is hurting for new ideas.
RSUq4VfWfjE,trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who mixed this trailer with this song? It's so choppy ....*play the song with some random parts...*pause the song.... *restart the song so you would hear the word angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t be the only person who thinks this looks terrible right?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The title could be “Triple O 7”, If you know what I mean..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Get woke, go broke!

Another SJW puke film.   🤮"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks just as bad as the all female oceans movie.... are writers and directors even trying anymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,I HATE SONY
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'M GONNA THROW UP!
RSUq4VfWfjE,These girls are so anorexic I cant take this seriously
RSUq4VfWfjE,"LOVE
""Keep your pretty mouth shut.""
That's Miley for you."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hate when people came here and said "" nah I don't care about the movie , I just came here for bla bal bla"" 
If you don't care about the movie don't watch it then"
RSUq4VfWfjE,FANTASTIC FANTASTIC FANTASTIC
RSUq4VfWfjE,Christina Stewart is back powerfully
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn't look funny or fun.  Pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks whack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kate, Farrah, Jaclyn and Cheryl will always rule."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin Stewart childhood crush😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems less comedic than the original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Holy crap! Noah Centineo!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Background music sounds like a teen nick Channel show.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism ruins everything.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bill Murray as Bosley. CMon!?!? It's more fun watching Hollywood destroy itself.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s 💩💩💩 take another dump on this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why stop there? Keep redoing other crappy movies?🤣😂🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Based on the trailer i think ill give it a chance. Its not like the forced ghostbusters. I loved the angels movies before when i was young so im not gonna hate this time
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok I love Kristen, Naomi and Ella but I loved Cameron, Drew and Lucy more and they'll always be my favourite Charlie's Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for LANA MILEY ARI COLLAB
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so excited to not see this movie!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trailers are supposed to make you interested into watching the movie! Not the bore the hell out of its viewers T^T
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, these bitches are beautiful."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"hmmmm, I seriously have mixed emotions for this one, I grew up watching barrymore, liu & diaz as angels and I LOVE them sooo much, Sony should've left it as is 😶"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"LANA, ARI AND MILEY TOO"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen Stewart 🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,Throw in Arnold schwarzenegger to these women in their place. In choke hold around his ballsack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bella Bella Bella, que bosta em"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart must be really hard up for some cash 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aaand the worst trailer song award goes toooo..

This piece of Noise."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here looking for Lana's part
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart's punches don't look like they'd hurt anybody, she's not fooling anyone"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m confused ...are there only 2 angels then they recruited another ? 😖
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they always ruin movies/shows by recasting 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,The TV reboot was bad enough but now we have this garbage. Hollywood never learns.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gosh, I've never seen Kristen Stewart look so alive.......


Hot though."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I found kristen sizzling hot in this...what a hairdo...!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No sex ...why??????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh you done fucked up. Just like the new Ghostbusters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Originality is ded
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks more like Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,🎥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why must they put HD in the title 😕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feisty!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why so flat??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I smell a flop, and it smells like a fish"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody cares about this bullshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,everything about this brand new Charlie's Angels are awesome 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,-
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤮🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande!! ❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,just gonna listen to the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looking like Teresa Palmer with that wig, or maybe Amber Heard... 🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart. Really? Was no one else’s career dead enough
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie Xavier is in this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah is that you?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks shite
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone think this is better than new batman trailer of Pattinson?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone else thought the movie was going to be Miley-Ari-Lana and is real disappointed now?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What a boring trailer,i don't even watch it full,
Where is the damn drama in movies,
Missing that 80s'90s Hollywood cinema"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm going to watch this cause i like Kristen Stewart! I don't care if they say blah blah blah!😛😛😛
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart: 5'5"" & 119 lbs. successfully fighting a gang of men twice her size. Sounds realistic. 😒"
RSUq4VfWfjE,K-Stew 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks Shi te
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism ruin things for girls now too 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For the first time, Kristen Stewart is showing different emotions in this trailer."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So naomi Scott is british yet playing an American that works in london
RSUq4VfWfjE,Again another remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks great i like all the actors and actresses  but i hope its not a mess on execution
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's seen like TOTALLY SPIES on DISNEY feels like.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I know the aughts Charlie's Angels movies weren't great, but I think they have a goofy charm that this movie just won't have. 
This movie seems like another one of those contrived ""girl power"" films that keep cropping up recently."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another SJW WOKE movie that will go bust.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi😍 looks > Low budget emma watson
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Live action Totally Spies would make more interesting than this reboot.*
Enough with the reboot, Hollywood."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now before you animals rip this trailer to shreds remember....just don’t watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Doesn't look as cheesy as the 2000's Angels, but could go either way.

We don't need another LGBTQ+?€£¥#%* pride parade. Supposedly there's a whole month dedicated to that collectivism facade.

The music in the trailer was meh."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ll watch pennywise instead.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like another DUD, stay home and go for a walk."
RSUq4VfWfjE,These studios just have no new ideas anymore. No one asked for this reboot. Nah this wont flop...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Semok semok
RSUq4VfWfjE,Zoomers edition.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wel come back Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First they gender swapped swapped Ghostbusters, now Charlie's Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I know people are preferring the original Charlie's Angels movies out of nostalgia, but even back then people thought they were bad. It's not like they've set an impossibly high standard that this reboot can't reach. If this is bad, it won't be any worse than the original movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,oh wow! more original titles from hollywood!! its ok plenty of sheep
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody ask.
RSUq4VfWfjE,LIT AF
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart again....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood: Ruining 90's classics one movie at a time.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey, remember the tv show that came out a few years ago? That will probably be better than this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,i think casting kirsten stewart was a weird choice
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Since they're replacing women with male characters so much, they should have done an all-male Charlie's Angels. But i guess that doesn't fit the agenda."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So three lesbians, and a Gay Charlie!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The movie itself in a nutshell 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait to see these Angels in action. People need to comprehend that the Townsend Agency is global. New corps of Angels are everywhere. This is exciting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ya i guess...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh this is Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Finally a movie with strong, short haired, overly masculine females taking on men three times their size without difficulty. It’s about time."
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow i can't wait to watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,enough with the remakes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watched the trailer bcoz of Naomi Scott!
Won't watch the movie bcoz of Naomi Scott!


She's almost nowhere!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is still full throttle ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,And now Bosley is a woman. WTF? This will be as big a hit as the latest Ghost Busters. I won’t even watch this on DVD.
RSUq4VfWfjE,MY FAVE - PRINCESS JASMINE !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,What if a male version of charlie's angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,💩💩💩💩💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It seems like a baby angels instead of Charlie's Angels, or is it actually the baby version of it??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks MEH
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least Kristen Stewart actually smiles and having fun in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everything was alright until Noah centineo appeared!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow 
Kristen Stewarts showing more than one facial expression"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just liking it cause Naomi
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is like totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too many wigs there.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Make something goddamn original for once!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is basically kingsman but just girls
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:04 that guy is look like Ashish chanchlani
RSUq4VfWfjE,0.52 min pubg wepon Aug....😂😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Huge risk for my beloved director (not in a sarcastic way, I do like her, not so sure if she is ready for this job ) and for Kristen."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana grande song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"SABINA!?!?!


Finally some name representation around here! It’s not mine but it’s as close as it’s gon get lmao"
RSUq4VfWfjE,More Hollywood CRAP...  :-(
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s Jasmine!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im only here for lana!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why ppl so mad
RSUq4VfWfjE,where's the lucy liu of the group :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ayeee this looks fire! Can't wait.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott has a huge charisma, beware girls, here comes a new queen. have not seen Aladin yet, but with just a couple clips and interviews I could see it. Mock my words."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This would be the movie on date night where if your girl wants to get intimate afterwards, you would say ""Not tonight, I have a headache."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Try Hard, the movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I actually liked it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many Charles angels are there lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf
RSUq4VfWfjE,and i WONT be seeing this. sorry not sorry.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Take my money
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry it looks like this is going to suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyone here is a hater. Wth is wrong with you people? Please spread love and appreciation 💗
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist bullshit
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have a bias against Kristen Stewart! I can't stand her acting, mostly because of her ""signature face"" which always seems to portray either having anxiety, being obnoxious, or just daydreaming. It's like her face is judging you for staring!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"hollywood must be running out of ideas cause for the past 3 years its been  nothing but remakes.








edit: there is nothing wrong with remakes...every now and then. Hollywood is putting more time in effort into remakes than original ideas. (and by og ideas i dont mean based off a comic book or part of an everlasting franchise that seems to never end. looking at you starwars and fast&furious )  For someone who wants to work in the film industry its got pretty boring & tiring to enjoy movies when they are remakes and you have to search for og ideas."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just here for Kristen Stewart's gay hair
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kirsten stewart is in this, therefore there is no acting."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naaaaah, will skip this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oooo kristen Stewart 🤣🤣 what a hair cut yar
RSUq4VfWfjE,Should of went straight to Netflix
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:

Not a breathing soul:

RSUq4VfWfjE,"It took me until the end to realize that it's a movie.  Wait...it's a movie...why?

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry but no, see the old one even whit out this music and cgi was just better , Hell even the old tv show was decent"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Maybe there's a better trailer, but as of now, it looks like a hot mess"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can Kristen Stewart get any hotter?😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Noah?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This cast does not grasp me like the other one
RSUq4VfWfjE,They really didn't try to put another Asian as an angel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It looks more like  Charles angels.
Behold x-women"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Second time watching this trailer and I love it even more💗. I always loved all the Charlie's Angel franchises whatever the format they were in. TV shows, Movies.. ""Les Drôles de Dame"" in French; which has NOTHING to do with the OV title 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ill only watch for Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks better then the TV reboot.

RSUq4VfWfjE,y’all really put no uh cent a mayo in here
RSUq4VfWfjE,No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm worried about getting a new x-men movie so soon after Dark Phoenix. The new studio should help.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm gonna take a guess and say white men are upset
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish after this movie there will be a Charlie's Angels 3. Like they did with Ghostbusters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Could have taken miley, ari, and lana girl as a cast members"
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like a feminist action movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whyyyyy do they keep remaking classics comeup with something new omgahhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like it might be to soon for a remake...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If a women has a short hair in a movie, she is either a lesbian or a badass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Won’t top the original but dope idea! 💡
RSUq4VfWfjE,lesbians unite ¿
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,great! Kristen and Naomi in 1 movie! love them
RSUq4VfWfjE,People seriously need too calm down. If this movie is not to your liking then don't watch it. You're probably not the targeted demographic either. Just calm down.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart? REALLY.....😧
RSUq4VfWfjE,"K. STEWART is back in the game, baby!
Gorgeous as always. 😍😘"
RSUq4VfWfjE,here only for LANA ARI N MILEY
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood is hurting for new and original ideas, I see."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope SONY is prepared to lose some money!!!!
I don't wish they do, but I think it's a certainty, so I hope they have calculated the loss!!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original will ALWAYS be better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should've made them an all male team... for equality.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:27 Twilight-ish vibes, when Bella kicked Jacob."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"None of these actresses exude sexuality than Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Esse filme formou gays vocês não tem NOÇÃO CARALHOOOOOO pode entrar garotas eu tava esperando vcs

*clicks video*


""bosley no...."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,look fawared it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood running out of material.  The 90s were the best years for original content and no reliance on comic books to carry them through the years.  Now they're doing re-makes.
Guess they're hoping the dumber generation will fall for this garbage.  Just throw in some popular singers on the soundtrack, that's the hook."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh Elizabeth Banks. You are so much better than this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The new M.I.B and Fast & Furious are clear examples of why old movies shouldn’t be modernised, so why do this 🤦🏽‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay but WHERE is the Asian representation like honestly....... honestly....... HONESTLY. Pay homage properly man. Jeez

RSUq4VfWfjE,"After the female cast Ghostbusters and Ocean's 8, I thought the Charlie's Angels reboot will have male protagonists."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This story seems 60% copy of Barbie Spy squad!!! o_o
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The logo thing is a T, so this is just Totally Spies? That i would believe."
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Looks Meh*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait I'm seen every Charlie's angels movie ever🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Carotid supplies the cerebral hemispheres and subcortical structures. Vertebral arteries supply the brainstem.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wack

RSUq4VfWfjE,it has porn movie vibes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine?

RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Im about to do what's called a pro gamer move"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So basically, a female version of Kingsman."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh ffs... Stewart. They hired the worst possible choice for, well, any film genre. No, gonna miss this one."
RSUq4VfWfjE,YAAAAAAAWN.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"More like Charlie's flat angels, am I right😠🤔."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ada naomi scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn I gotta wait 5 months to see a movie that I don't wanna see
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG NAOMI AND CHRIStAN
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love Naomi Scott and the guy from Netflix, but I don’t agree with the message of this movie. Stop comparing women to men. We all are equal. Just because a women does something, don’t make it a big deal. All women are capable of achieving our dreams, but the true women who succeed don’t show it. If this movie is trying to be a women empowerment movie, show all types. I mean like why am I, a girl with a ton insecurities( physically and emotionally) , not represent along side these stunning women???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They messed this up by putting kristen stewart in this. I already know its trash now.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn .....
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks like a series that gets cancelled on episode 3🙃
RSUq4VfWfjE,AM I THE ONLY WHO EXCITED BECAUSE THERE'S NOAH CENTINEO!!!???
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just here cause of Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ESE CHABON VA A SER HE-MAN, ME QUIERO MATAR"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The fact that I get to here Kristen Stewart’s voice again makes me genuinely happy ngl (ever since twilight)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,This might be the worst trailer I've ever seen. It somehow spoils the movie without ever telling the premise of the movie or anything.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's as though some retarded, brain-damaged, trans-lesbo cult has been given carte blanche to dictate the same moronic misandrist narrative, for all of these weirdo, virtue-signaling, feminazi movies, spewing out of Hollywood's fetid orifice recently."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is Noah Centineo in this movie? I was excited for it, but not so much anymore..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope nope nope nope....theyre probably covered and full of sjw crap 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wouldnt be surprised if they all meet up at a planned parenthood
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like the trio, not sure about the story tho, seems a little too mainstream."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do you hate men?
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Lana sing ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,SUCKS
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,TRASH FIRE ALERT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmm ಠ_ʖಠ
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another one of my favorite childhood movies ruined 😪
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whyyyyyyyyy just whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Prediction: 30% on Rotten Tomatoes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh kristen stewart 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"LAME! Hollywood as always, keeps running out of ideas."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Should have just left it alone honestly they keep making live actions and reboots of old movies and it’s not the same in my opinion.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This trailer is so weird, bad, unlikable 
Except 
Naomi Scott😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring af
RSUq4VfWfjE,Add a black woman because diversity
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah I'm pretty damn tired of the remakes too, XXX Return of Xander Cage & what not! & look who else is in this movie, it's Charles Xavier y'all, where's your wheel chair? Wait a minute, he's dead! For those of y'all who haven't seen Logan? Lol! Wow!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks BS like you can ever replace Cam,Drew and Lucy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHERE'S KRISTEN STEWART'S OSCAR!!!!??????
RSUq4VfWfjE,lo que no sabía que quería ver 🤤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Audience - is another film in which miniature females beat up men. Who wanted him?
2019 - yes"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sale Naomi Scott la tengo que ver alv 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess 2019 will be the best year for failed reboots.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soon they will have to make tranny reboots for the female reboots
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Let's see, men in black has women now to make it gender equal however Charlie's angels don't have a man in the role as one of the angels. Smelling hypocritical a bit."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey look another reboot, does Hollywood have any original ideas left or is the entirety mere hacks?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girl power kind of sucks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""CHARLIE'S ANGELS : sjw"", coming soon!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew Barrymore was the most badass and cutest Charlie's Angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crazy modern day feminists are taking over everything ... It's a no for me 🤷
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cameron Diaz is best
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not sure if this is a trailer for a movie or a song
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks really awkward idk y. Not sure if it's because of Kristen Stewart or idk.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not gonna lie look scrapy af
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it too late for them to send this straight to Netflix or DVD?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Snow White and Princess Jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is looking sexy in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Corny af
RSUq4VfWfjE,T R A S H
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WTF is this sh**, bunch of failed nobody actors doing the famous chicflick remake ... damn"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Does Hollywood have ANY original ideas for film anyone? Or are they just going to keep remaking the same movies over and over and over again? And is every Hollywood movie going to be a feminist propaganda, indoctrination infomercial? SMH."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't call me angel
Oof when is the song coming out"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It’s just me, or they try to make this movie even more feministic, than the original one?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is how feminist's heaven looks like.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This film will end careers...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not gonna lie... I’m only here for Ariana Grande
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super excited OMG I love Charlie's angels the original trio was iconic but cmon this one looks exciting af & I love all three actresses can't wait to see their performances !
RSUq4VfWfjE,How could these skinny women overpower men in a fist fight? It's not a superhero movie . I don't understand.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What if it flop at the Box office like MIB international  what will Sony reboot next?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"literally only care about the song with ariana, miley, and lana the movie looks iffy tho"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great, another shitty remake. Like we didn't have enough already. 😒"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another failed jumanji
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh dear this looks hideous. Please stop what’s next a Ghostbusters remake with all women! Oh wait........
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let’s all be honest the original nor the remake are so incredible that it can never be remade
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well this will be an absolute disaster
RSUq4VfWfjE,The feminist power movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't really hear Lana's voice in the song at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this trailer might have been really great... if I could see anything that’s happening in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanna see it because of Naomi and because Ari is singing the sing😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"HARD PASS on this garbage. I support PlayStation so much & Sony owns PlayStation but I cannot support this feminist crap.

Also, I thought that Twilight chick is a lesbian so why is she pretending she likes men now??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was honestly wanting a reboot for yrs I was very excited, then reality hit me like a Wilder right hand and I was out cold from sheer boredom 😴"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No no no no no no no 😤
RSUq4VfWfjE,I could tell by the thumbnail this was trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Or we can have an all female led cast film that isn’t a reboot for once
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We are angles 
Men Villains : Are we Joke to you??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh my gosh...  This is awesooooome!!!! 🤘🤘🤘
Noah Centineo's in... 😱😱😱"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this one look like it came out first the older one looks more like New.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uhmm, who else is looking forward to that *Ariana, Miley & Lana Del Rey* Collab ✨"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Marty We gotta go back"" XD"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice closets Kristin
RSUq4VfWfjE,"damn why everyone hating like damn the movie didn’t even come out , give it a chance. It honestly looks dope."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks B Grade
RSUq4VfWfjE,A lot of people seem to think Patrick Stewart is playing Charlie.  They're clearly not familiar with the franchise.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can everybody just shhushh Im trying to hear Lana’s voice
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yaaaaasssssss!!!!!! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 Go Girls!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,why they copy and paste movies like this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did we REALLY need another Charlie's Angel movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks better than I thought it would...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a cool movie actually. But.... Thats not Charlies Angels. Doesnt give the vibes to the slightest.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didn't see this coming at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,im here for it 🤷🏽‍♀️ 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,bella really stepped up her game as a vampire
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is noah centipede in this 💀
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies head ahh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I got nothing from this trailer and it'll most likely flop at the box office.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is taking itself wayyyy too seriously
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love it........waiting for the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remake it sure that’s fine, but why does it have to have a feminist agenda, why can’t it just be entertainment?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is what Kimberly did after college
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: I wonder if this gonna be super femin
Commercial: I think women can do anything"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not bad... not bad at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't want to be that guy but that CGI background was bad on 2:26
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg back those days remmbering

RSUq4VfWfjE,😍🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"looks cheap and...

RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m disliking this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood: ""maybe if we keep making bad reboots, eventually people will pay to see them"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for queen ari.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nahh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The original is WAAAYYYYYY better. And let me tell ya right now, I love Charlie’s Angels. But idk ‘bout this stuff."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So excited for Kristen Stewart!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hmm. Seeing as there were already two Charlie's Angels movies with female leads way back when, shouldn't we, in the progressive age that we're in, be making this movie with three dudes?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watch the men complain if they aren't fully nude for 60% of the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will like it more if it didn't look like a Sony movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:29 kristen looks like niall horan in you & i music video
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kinda upset they showed Charlie in the Trailer. Ruins the whole face revel after you only hear him over the speaker phone.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just another woman movie I love that !!! Females taking over 🦋
RSUq4VfWfjE,"STOP👏🏼DOING👏🏼REMAKES 

🙄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The song choice definitely doesn't help the trailer but angels don't feel authentic. There is no personality, no charisma."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Press F to pay respect for another franchised ruined.
RSUq4VfWfjE,At 1:45 you can see costumes from the 2000's movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just going to make them all gay and Charlie is now an Asian transgender.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No bad woman only bad guys that's sexism
RSUq4VfWfjE,hello
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope. Not going to see this if I get a blow job in the movie theatre. For watching it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not gonna lie, Stewart extra hot"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's a rent it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm honestly surprised they're not men or transgenders.
RSUq4VfWfjE,they should have called it a live action totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll watch it for Naomi Scott.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As panteras, kkkkkk"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Having the 3 main characters as females wasn't woke enough that they had to make Bosley a chick too..

Also; what's with all the guns?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now they're making a new Charlie's angles with all women??? Hollywood has gone too far!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uh since when is Princess Jazmine training to be a badass....?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Should’ve made Totally Spies instead
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cliché, Cliché, Cliché, NEXT"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So instead of calling them X-Women Charles called them Angels... Better than Mistakes idea.
Side note: Handsome nerd? What is he... The directors cousin or something?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Men movie: Not enough Women

Women movie: Not enough short hair.


Wtf is next?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Another feminazi movie...  They're sooo strong in scenarios ! LMAO*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just the extremely generic music alone tells me that this is going to suck.

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll definitely watch this. Don't care if is a remake/reboot or whatever. Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott are in it so for me it's worth watching. Go away haters you're all hating for no reason."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yov what have u done???? i will go watch Drew Barrymore's version. i luved it..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh. I can't tell if the movie is generic or the trailer makes it look like it's generic.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Выглядит как будто Кристин Стюарт играет в кино
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like the girls doesn’t match with the roles

RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood sucks more every new day.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This shits gonna be so garbage. It’s actually insane to think about how bad it’s gonna do.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Finally, Kristen learns how to act!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley never shows his face
RSUq4VfWfjE,My Charlies Angel: 2:37-2:40

RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m ThE LeAd PrOgRaMmER. S-sure you are.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well.. that sucks .
RSUq4VfWfjE,For the people that are saying this is a reboot if you'd read the video's description it'll say that the angels agency has expanded and went international with many groups of angels being guided by different bosleys. Also at 1:44 and 1:47 you can see some costumes from the other charlie's angels movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aweful...just aweful. This will be as bad as Ghostbusters, The Vagina Edition."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart giving us facial expressions.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They need to stop and I saw some people say they should make a totally spies. Movie I agree but at the same time nah

RSUq4VfWfjE,Everybody be hatin
RSUq4VfWfjE,Those mints are going to be important somehow...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm keen 😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,So basically this is Fast and Furious 7 but without the cars and everyone is female?
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least this could go full sjw and no one will notice.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yay another reboot no one asked for. 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only watch this trailer because of Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,I fear this will be a flop! Worse than Dark Phoenix or whatever that movie was.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Bella Swan is gonna collab with Princess Jasmine.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:52 if i am not wrong, but she looks like Abella danger"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awesome trailer  kristen looks very cool.........
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Biggest no, just no. 
thank you"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:33 instantly reminded me of Totally Spies, still have mixed feelings about the movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should have made them all men, or at least meet me halfway and make them 3 gay guys."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Your not supposed to see charlie and where is The Chaaaaaad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Man I couldn't even get trough the half of the trailer its so cringy .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait...so princess Jasmine and Bella are Charlie's angels?!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,edward is bat man and bella is a charlie’s angel. 2008 me is crying and so is 2019 me
RSUq4VfWfjE,smh hollywood always got to include light skinned woman: no star power from the trio
RSUq4VfWfjE,I shut this trailer off halfway through. The chick tunes were completely destroying everything that I was trying to watch. And what I was watching was terrible. This flick is for the ladies. We will see if enough females will turn out to watch it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like pure 💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is so charismatic!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is awwww 🥰!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yay, i am here for it !!! reboot & all. the women look amazing & Kristen Stewart is gay hot !!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Ariana and all but why even put Lana’s name if she’s not in the song. I was SO looking forward to hearing Lana 😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 and Kirsten Stewart still doesn't have a personality
RSUq4VfWfjE,JASMINEEE KENAPAAA KAMU JADIII MAFIAAAAAAA
RSUq4VfWfjE,the songs sound badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me that thinks Kirsten Stewart would have been a better choice to play captain marvel in the mcu
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shouleve gotten the SPICE GIRLS for the roles......yeeeeahhhh😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Old Angels has different Personality. but this New Angels are like Depressed ladies acting to be Cool.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Angels were always smokin HOT sorry Kristen Stewart looks like a gemlin this wont do. Also they made Bosley a woman? Why? Is Charlie gonna be a woman too? Great (inserts sarcasm)😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,JANELLE MONAE MUSICCCCCC
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uh yeah idk about this one...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Come to my attention Charlie was up to some shady stuff
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missing camron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Guys a fun trailer, but the audio is out of sync."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart as the blonde from Ghostbusters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart “I have so many talents”
Me “to bad acting isn’t one of them”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original movie had charm... The best way to describe this is 3 girls trying to be unoriginal men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angel's or Totally Spies?






I understand that Totally Spies is based on Charlie's Angel's, but the gadget and fashion stuff puts this movies in a reverse inspiration mood? And I love it?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music didn't fit this trailer at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks amazing !😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh. Not politically correct enough for my liking.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are they playing Ariana grande over an action trailer???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart as Miley Cyrus
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soundtracks sounds 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Last time I checked Bosley had a man voice, so wasn't Bosley supposed to be a dude?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me before the trailer : has high hopes & been loving the franchise since i was a child
Me after the trailer : oh..this film still aims for child audiences."
RSUq4VfWfjE,How is it that Garret Watts hasn't commented on this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,POOR CASTINGS!!! Goodluck to this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Reboots galore*
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is a mess.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"9 more subscribers and ya boy is finally at 170 subscribers, soon 🤞🏽"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of the worst edited trailers I've ever seen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen Stewart!
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow is this what the womens empowerment movement is capable of? im just blown away. were equal after all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,i feel like this movie aim for toddlers and teens up to 12 years old.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Queenswoman
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is gonna be awesome,already love it <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should of gotten real badass women for this movie! I understand this is also trying to make a new generation, but nothing is new or special about this movie!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally a better love story than twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies? 🤨
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks like Ellen and Miley cyrus had a kid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks more like gossip girls but with guns
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Since Xavier's school is now Jean Grey's school, Charles started a new X-force kinda thing...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wouldve preferred Ariana, Miley & Lana tbh 🤷🏾‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't take this film serious 🤦🏽🤦🏽🤦🏽😤💯
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too cerebral   for me  ...just bring back entertainment...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart is best Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least is Patrick Stewart here
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait to see my favourite Kirsten Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen actually fits really well!!! She got a sharp expression
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist  Angel..
RSUq4VfWfjE,stream come to brazil by why don’t we!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m going to miss Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu. They were way funnier, but still badass."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks lame.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another garbage remake that will flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This ....... 






Looks terrible"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Una película para esperar en DVD, wait!!! Si existen todavía los DVDs? 😁"
RSUq4VfWfjE,hello 911 i’m gay and in love with kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,My Jasmine 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mark my words this movie will bomb at the box office. Nothing against the angels I just have a feeling it's going to fail badly.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks really doesn't have to always put herself in her films, imo."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They will never measure up to the original angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg y am I feeling so gay rn? 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,-_- damn. I want to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That was so goddamn cringey. Why can't major studios make a female led film without the cringe? Sony take note --> Atomic Blonde, The Villainess (Korean Film), Annihilation and I'm sure there are a ton of others I can't remember right now."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They stole that closet joke from the princess diaries 2. It's time to riot ladies
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤔🤔🤔🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,No recoil on the bullpup in that car chase scene. Virtually no acting there. Is the director directing or what's up? It's not being picky if it's a standard nowadays.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ah, stiff as a board, can't act Kristin Stewart. Because that has always improved a story 🙄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centimino ruins it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Unoriginal ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only reason I might go see this is Noah Centineo
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Men in black, child’s play, Aladdin and now this, Hollywood really running out of ideas"
RSUq4VfWfjE,yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,After watching John wick  most of the action movies look like trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is confusing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Haha....nah nah nah nah
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Come on KStew!! Been stanning since those Twilight days. Who else is a die hard twi-hard?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Legends of tomorrow did it better with sos 😹
RSUq4VfWfjE,"you know when your grandparents get you new t-shirts for Christmas that you didn't ask for, but you're still going to wear. that's what this movie is."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This decade is full of remakes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Powerpuff Girls / Totally Spies crossover.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Será un increíble
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is making me nervous. Hope it delivers in theaters. Even though I miss the older version with Lucy Liu
RSUq4VfWfjE,remake after remake after remake I wonder when people will get bored?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Totally Spies"" The Movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Again? Can Hollywood not come up with anything original anymore?

Its all remakes and comic book movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,why would they choose to recreate this iconic movie with these three not that naomi or ella aren’t great but seriously where’s scarlett
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yet another Charlie's Angels? Come on... This movie industry is pathetic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man, this looks awful. 💩🤮"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just because you could do a Charlie's Angels remake in the current year,doesn't mean you should."
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tbh I’m mostly excited for the ariana , Miley Lana collab"
RSUq4VfWfjE,“Charlie’s Angels 2019” is the new “Ghostbusters 2016”.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Every micro-second of this mess is STUPID.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m really really surprised Charlie isn’t a woman’s voice
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who else only come for ari, Miley, and Lana 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart kinda looks like miley cyrus
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tf is this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,se huele a fracaso
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood cranking out flops like IHOP
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,i bet this movie was inspired by the MeToo movement. ahahahah
RSUq4VfWfjE,So when is the single coming out ? Lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer should have came with a Lotion commercial
RSUq4VfWfjE,Suppppppper
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i’m just excited for noah centineo, and ari lana and miley’s colab"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously though, you cant tell me there are no writers in Hollywood with an original idea for a movie. Also....Kristen Stewart???? 🤦‍♀️ Yeah I'm gonna pass on this one"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has disaster written all over it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like horrible PC bs.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie will fail hard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Remember those times when in a trailer played Crystal method and Prodigy and the main theme remixed by Apollo Four Forty? Real music for action films)) Not this))
RSUq4VfWfjE,That was painful to watch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohhhh wow...bosley is now female? Lol why arent the Angels male?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Others: I love the song
*Me: Counting the number of wigs*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old is gold New is diamond💎
RSUq4VfWfjE,*I Thought There Would Be RacyAngels*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"bagus bngt film nya,rugi klo gak nonton..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:06 NOAH ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,47% on Rotten Tomatoes sounds about right. 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another ghost busters movie lamo
RSUq4VfWfjE,i feel this movie like Totally Spies than Charlie's Angels 😶😶
RSUq4VfWfjE,ghost busters.. men in black.. and now this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Movie name: Charlie's Angels
Song: Dont call me angel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks gorgeous in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im afaird already
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:43 is that Abella danger?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"On a scale of 1-10, this movie is retarded."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ths is What Charlies is upto ths days After Retiring From Jean Greys School...
RSUq4VfWfjE,The feminist are taking over
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kirsten
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is garbage! 👏 👏 👏 This is garbage! 👏 👏 👏 This is garbage! 👏 👏 👏 This is garbage! 👏 👏 👏

RSUq4VfWfjE,"What Producers Believe People came For : *Kristen,Naomi and Ella*
.
What people Came for: *lana,Miley,Ariana*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this loook cool💕💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Huuum!!!! Kristen as an Angel 👼 Nope 👎 
She’s way to stuck on Bella please send her back for a Twilight series 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Everyone’s like “this is gonna suck lol” but how come no ones like this for shitty remakes/sequels of films with guys? Seriously, this could be alright, ocean 8, captain marvel, Wonder Woman etc all turned out great while everyone trashed them, have a little faith."
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY!!! Just WHY!!!!!!..........    SOOOO WRONG on soooo many Levels.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girl power yeahh!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m subscribing to all my subs 
(Small channel trying to grow)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart was the only part of this trailer I enjoyed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like one of those straight to vod sequels. Huge cast, but just looks super weak."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wishe they used totally spies intro music Here we Go
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTTTTT
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now compare this trailer to 2003’s Full Throttle.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No just no Lucy lu and drew berrymore are the only angles I know besides the original tv show.
RSUq4VfWfjE,An all woman cast? Are you serious? Not a single guy. Cmon this is 2019 and we couldnt have a Male lead for the men to relate to. Embarrassing
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It... looks fine... I guess. Might pirate it if I'm bored next year, if I can even remember that it exists."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another women's power movie. This is why the movie industry is dead. They put out crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn't hate the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Do we really need two mentions of that new song...?
RSUq4VfWfjE,IM ONLY HEAR TO SUPPORT LANA
RSUq4VfWfjE,ahhh hahahahahaha!!!!....Garbage lmao!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am only here for the song..
By ARIANA.miley and lana....
ONLY THE SONG."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still can't write and original movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It would have been cool if some of fifth harmony was Charlie’s angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nobody asked for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This feels too much like Totally Spies to be a coincidence... It feels like the ONLY reason it was called Charlie's Angels is because it's more well known, even though Totally Spies is in every way superior."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song tho!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t know how to feel about this movie it looks interesting but put together lazily. Plus Kristen Stewart is so dry when she acts 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worst Charlie's Angel I have ever seen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charly s Angel where   ???
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLES X IS REALLY THE BOSS OF EVERYONE HUH
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope Kristen Stewart can show a range of emotion besides cardboard like in the Twilight movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charles what did you do....
.
Totally Spies :3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone see Kristen do the legs on shoulders twilight move at the beginning??? I'm hooked already. I will always love Bella Swan!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well , I can't say no to Patrick Stewart 
Take my f*cking money SONY"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash at its finest.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks lame af
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No... just no.. just... 






No🤦🏽‍♀️ 



However, I’ll only watch it for Naomi Scott."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm telling you if women start directing movies, there will  literally be no guys in it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait didn’t she just Jasmine from Aladdin






Ps: I don’t think there is anything wrong with that Mk"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idk it looks alright but they need to at least have density child sing a new version of independent women plsssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg shitty soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, this is bad! I mean Jem bad! 👩‍🎤💩🤦‍♂️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow .... Shocked   to see  Kirsten Stewart  In Charlies Angels  ...But AWESOME Character LOVe  TO watch
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart, I am too gay for this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t Believed one of the actors is professor X from Marvel’s X-Men is played by Patrick Stewart is now playing as Charlie himself
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Haha looks like trash. 

Please tell me they are trying to make it a comedy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why no asian girl 😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi scott yayyyyy i love her
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Title should ""You Won't Believe What Sir Patrick Stewart Will Do For A Paycheck The Movie"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies Angels without the sex appeal equals lose half of your audience
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jane looks like Kat Graham from TVD
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came only for the song because my queen lana del rey. The movie meh 🙄 they don't look badass to me. I stick to the old one ~
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nada como Cameron Días, las originales"

RSUq4VfWfjE,What a joke
RSUq4VfWfjE,?

RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine gone bad...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is the culture of violence! an other useless movie!

RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf is Noah Centennial doing here
RSUq4VfWfjE,nah...
RSUq4VfWfjE,The editing of this trailer was trash though
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fragile
RSUq4VfWfjE,*LANA*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,YOU'RE NOT A WAITRESS 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nowadays I Don't know why everyone is into finding flaws in the movies😂😂😂 every movie released these days, none of em could win the hearts of the audience"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The scene with Noah in it.. I just...!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,La era de la falta de creatividad 😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t know where to begin, the song is just awful 🙄 something more action could’ve better and and it could’ve been more of a spy movie like the original, this just looks like they’re cops 😐"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I remember watching one of their movies this as a kid
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm totally here for it!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. So many butthurt misogynists in the comment section.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait for them to make a game out of this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jasmine, Effie, and Bella Swan on the same team...Let’s see how this goes..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will bomb fantastically well done Sony smh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for hear to Lana Del rey ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why do I feel like this movie will be a complete flop, Trailer was totally disappointing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh. This is just ripe for more sjw pandering.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop remaking movies Hollywood thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,They pulled another SlenderMan
RSUq4VfWfjE,A big NO to that Ariana Grande song. Makes the whole thing sound Kim Possible-ish. Boring trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,they should have got the 2000s cast and done a sequel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody :
Hollywood : here's another reboot"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so budget and bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cute, but no!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so terrible....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am gna watch it just for kristen stewart but this looks bang average tbh....elizabeth banks never should have directed it couldnt they find anyone better....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope the trailer isnt like the movie bc it looks mediocre.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are they wearing so much cloths? Might as well put on a burka...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was disappointed in the beginning to see Naomi not being an Angel. Then as the trailer progressed, I was happy to see her becoming one of the Angels. Yay! Naomi Scott ❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Eh, I neither like it or dislike it. Seems harmless, even though I was expecting worse."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Welcome to cringe fest people! Nothing but the best here
RSUq4VfWfjE,And the era of the reboot continues.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood has no creativity.  It's always remakes after sequals  after prequels.  They can't create anything new.
RSUq4VfWfjE,movie business have officially run out of ideas
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another flop movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Team Edward
RSUq4VfWfjE,STUPID
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Non-Binary Gender-Fluid Woke Transgender Feminangels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Girls can do anything.""

Yea.... not buying it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a lot of fun. Not every movie has to be a masterpiece. I can imagine it being very entertaining
RSUq4VfWfjE,Club cuervos
RSUq4VfWfjE,👏👏👏👏👏  👍 😘🇦🇷
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummmm the angels are supposed to be WHITE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier’s  Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They just made C.A. into the Fast and The Furious for women. Part 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are all in the works."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart finally in the lesbian role she deserves
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super cringe. But if Lana del Rey is making a soundtrack to this it has somewhat been saved maybe
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Totally not Spies but Totally Spies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,😕😑😷😝😝 movies 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks horrific
RSUq4VfWfjE,This kinda reminds me of totally spies

RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyone seems to hate this trailer!! Now I kinda feel weird for actually liking it 😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart choking out greedy millionaires stealing humanitarian aid money is my spirit animal tbh lol.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Its 2019, shouldn't this film be called Charlie's Cupids, featuring 3 gay guys?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not the same without Lucy lu
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is this like...

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart, the OG girl crush."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soooo excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait ㅠㅠ
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is so beautiful no doubt but she looks terrible in short hair cut
RSUq4VfWfjE,"With about 40+ hit films switching male roles into female, I'm surprised this wasn't switched into male roles.
We go an all girl cast swap for Ghostbusters, what women want, Terminator the list goes on. Lol but if its already an all girl film it doesn't go the other way 🤣🤣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing New
RSUq4VfWfjE,they really had to go and ruin the movie with Noah centimeter huh😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohhh Myyy goodness this is going to be a grand blockbuster 😻😻💕🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait wait, Charlie is still a guy? What about girl power?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Small channel ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s very weird to not see Kristin Stewart as a helpless teen
RSUq4VfWfjE,no feel
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth banks is as old as Cameron Diaz pretty much, why not just bring her back as the Bodley Cameo??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its going to be super flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please someone tell me this is a joke. It looks so bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok who is Charlie he sounds so familiar
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else came here for the sound track angels 😇 😇
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The Best : Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus & Lana Del Rey 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No thanks, it will be a flop for sure."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope well I'ma not watch this. I'm an original kind of gal
RSUq4VfWfjE,who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"HAHAHAH Kristen Stewart wtf

RSUq4VfWfjE,Wanna hear a joke? Three Mary Sues walks into a movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok never knew I needed this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Like other trilogy, when the reboot fails at the box office they will make another Charlie's Angels but a direct sequel to the second film with the original cast returning ignoring the reboot"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,It actually doesn't look that bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,👎 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:04 is that Noah?
Edit: it was Noah...aaaaaaah!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does this mean your gonna make a shitty game.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah
RSUq4VfWfjE,Consider me IN
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg Kirsten Stewart actually smiled that’s a first
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Woah a movie with women leads that doesn’t try to shove down your throat the fact that they are women? 

UNREAL"
RSUq4VfWfjE,At least it’s not shoving the whole woman are powerful thing every 5 seconds in the trailer 🤷‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why am I not feeling this movie? 😖
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohhhhh yeh wait is over...😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,I predict that Charlie's Angels will bomb all the way to hell
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only thing I am interested in this movie is the Lana-Ari-Miley collab  ;_;
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked it and legit don't get the complains here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,is this necessary tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I will watch this for Kirsten Stewart only, movie looks generic and boring... And nothing beats the original TV cast IMO,."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This should be titled ""Charles Xavier's Angels"" 🤣 ... Also, this looks like one of those straight to DVD movies 😑"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wonder if they will beat up any women. Or is that not allowed? Only ok to have hench""men"" and not hench""women"" I guess."
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF! Where is Asian girl ?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The most famous/respected actor in the movie who is literally playing the character who’s name is in the title of the movie gets no name in credits cause he is a man😂🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry none of them have the personalities that can compare to Cameron Diaz drew Barry Moore and Lucy liu...big flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should do a all male reboot of Charlie's angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks badass.😀
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana grande what ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,No....just..no....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"While the 2000 Charlie's Angels movie was not Oscar worthy by any stretch, there was a style to it that made it a fun watch and the casting felt right. Im not getting a great vibe from this trailer. I may give this a chance when it hits streaming"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"they showing wardrobe for the half of the trailer, looks like reboot of the”sex and the city”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Luis Gerardo Méndez :o
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh I’m dying of laughter rn
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can anyone tell who voices Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Go Wamans
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now That's Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,janelle monae ariana grande & my entire childhood. I'm down.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shut up and take my money!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just came to hear Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Professor x left the xmen, to make x women"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh I think I’ll stick to the old ones with cameron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn’t look like it can compare to the other Charlie’s Angels &  I won’t waste my $ to go see this but I will just wait till it come out on putlocker to see it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,The songs a bop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For someone that have only watch kristen stewart in twilight, she looks like someone who took too much cocaine and going wild"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, no gender swap for this one. I say there should be an all guy charlies angels 🙃"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Idc what people are saying I’ll still go watch this,just to see them angels 😳🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤦🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande's  voice😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not feeling it....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The cast seems too young for this kind of role.
They look like they belong in teenage comedy-drama movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally dumb as hell 😂😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Which is more jarring: K stew (shrug & mumble) playing the sexy part or watching little girls beat up 200 pound goons?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Annoying music and an Ok trailer !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't tell me: Patrick Stewart is a bad guy.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I literally thought one of the Angels was Abella Danger...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yall this is a sequel. Not a remake. So it obviously cant top the original show/movie...cause it isn't a remake. The 2000 version will always be amazing but just note this movie is it's own thing just with the same concept.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rio de Janeiro???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excited!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,not watching this movie because noah cent. is in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤔😤 *Who approved of this?! Charlie’s Angels has the potential of being GREATER. This would have been either left alone or made with better production and actors/actresses. Or continued with the original cast. This looks mediocre at its best* 😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is terrible terry.
RSUq4VfWfjE,R.I.P Bernie Mac
RSUq4VfWfjE,It have Patrick Stewart? Okay I'm going to watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yarn😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women can’t beat men up. Staaaap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its make me to remember my fvrt cartoon totally spice😭😙😆😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Si eres de México sabrás que habrá ""gasonileras"" en este trailer"
RSUq4VfWfjE,When Kstew gives a better performance than Brie Larson as Captain Marvel lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg hearing Lana in the song was my favorite part of the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,With the disappointment of the Hellboy reboot I have a feeling that this is also going to be a crappy reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omfg I just noticed in the background of the closet scene the have outfits that Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz wore in the first Charlie’s Angles movie and the full throttle movie 😯"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lez-Bean Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me parece una falta de respeto que pongan al último a Lana, cuando la carrera de miley cyrus está más muerta que mi vida sexual"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminazi's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song ruined it for me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope. (That's the girl who played Jasmine in Aladdin right?)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"IDK why, but most movies reboot today are shot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I missing the comedy part already😩😩😩😩
RSUq4VfWfjE,No original movies anymore huh just remakes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I saw Patrick Stewart, that's all i needed to see. This movie looks like its gonna be another  ""silly"" movie but I could be wrong. Lets see."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, this looks as awesome as I hoped it would be. Cool cast and fun action. Looking forward to November."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They are missing a cool asian girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,And of course Noah is in this 🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is like Tea without sugar..
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's 👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is a Politically Correct version of Charlie's Angels?  Smells like a stinker.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Pink Ranger, Princess Jasmine and now, an Angel. 
I've fallen in love for the third time with the same girl😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:04 oMg nOaH cEnTiMeTeR
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like the remake of Oceans 8.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like imma go to watch it ironically but end up loving it
RSUq4VfWfjE,So...it's a reboot...that looks like Kingsmen ...full of chicks?   Kingswomen?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uhmm they forgot my Asian girllllll
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one that doesn't want to see Kirsten Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waiting for the song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminist in action movie? 🥵
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sexy and unwoke. Hope the movie is also.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This felt like a very long trailer...
RSUq4VfWfjE,no thanks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart really said GAY RIGHTS with this role
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This look ordinary, toooooo ordinary"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gawd this looks freaking terrible!!! Anyone else actually lol pondering how stupid this looks? Like, they seriously made a video ad of this and this was the best footage they could collect for it hahahaha"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Jane girl is the only one I'm convinced whose a spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought Bosley was a man?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another one???? Ugh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll take ""Things no one asked for"" for $2000, Alex"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew Barrymore Lucy Lui and Cameron Diaz has already done a remake which was both awesome and they were sexy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yaaay... not only another remake but another heavily feminist endorsed movie at that... because ya know, we want that nowadays"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fierce!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,okay i’m kinda excited for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,i think the trailer is very messy
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG I'm inlove with Kirsten she is so hot!
RSUq4VfWfjE,*femenist vibes intensifying*
RSUq4VfWfjE,was bout to press like button then saw bosley is woman now..nevermind....just another feminized sjw propaganda film. 👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Professor Charles in this? I'm scared that this is gonna end up pretty bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,They're focusing more on the action they dont look like spies the only reason I would see this movie Patrick Stewart looks funny in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well i see noah
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For me Lucy, Drew and Cameron are the best."
RSUq4VfWfjE,More hot trash remakes...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks so hot🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,You can try to make a better Charlie’s Angels but you can’t.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this came out of nowhere — I’m so fucking reading for this tho 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Destinys child renunites🥳
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this a third remake????wow movies suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing tops the Destiny's Child ""Independent Woman"" single for the 2001 Charlie's Angels soundtrack.  It really set the tone and the music video was fire! 🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay thats twice in a row I see the TAVOR 21
RSUq4VfWfjE,So what is Patrick Stewart's role in this?   I thought he was Bosley but they've made him female now so.....???
RSUq4VfWfjE,this will suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh Boy John Luke Picard, this is what it comes down to now that all X-men are dead..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame acting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf this isnt Charlie's angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is the actress from aladdin?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is the Kristen Stewart i've been waiting for...finally a movie where she doesn't look like she just hit her thumb with a hammer.
...And she lookin bangin asf yo!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Two and a half minutes of pure cringe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not feelin it. gunna pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope this is as fun and funny as the 2000s ones
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be one of those movies I can tell
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Puh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not needed. Unwanted.
RSUq4VfWfjE,is dat juan carlos from the murder mystery?? 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,i really love kristen in a playful role it suits her so friekn well hehhe excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks lame...
RSUq4VfWfjE,These days Noah Centineo and Naomi Scott are everywhere.
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I saw was Bonnie's forehead.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony is learning,,,, i guess. Crossing my fingers, no sjw pc bs, this will be nice"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Alright, so I didn't want to give this a chance, but... It actually looks like it might be a fun watch."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ariana, miley and lana😍😍❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Kristen looks amazing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m very happy there’s a character like Naomi’s in this movie. We rarely see that personality in female characters. I’m kinda tired of the badass female who can do anything. I’d much rather see a girl who’s kinda like a rookie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"im waiting for the song, Lana......"
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen looks so pretty been waiting for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:10 how i feel when the studio makes this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana 😍 2:27
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soyboys will be like..😛😛😛
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOOOOO!!!! Not my angels. Can’t redo Cameron Lucy and drew sorry! Not happening
RSUq4VfWfjE,lol bella still a vampire
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like they black washed another character. Why aren’t people upset about this, but they were with doctor strange?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Q5 with a bodykit. Please stop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be one of those movies that doesn't rate well but I'm gonna love
RSUq4VfWfjE,"no no no no because there are not the girls of the second version that we know, I hope it is a resounding failure for them to learn"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart & Naomi Scott 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,There is another closet?:)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't call me an angel😇😇...well u r Ariana..u truly are!!!
& with Miley & Lana it'll be great fun too🎈😍😋😋"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tf is this a joke?😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,P.S. whotf is Naomi Scott??
RSUq4VfWfjE,pfft cant wait to see this bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,***Future box office flop***
RSUq4VfWfjE,So like is Elizabeth Banks a real player now? Girl is producing films for days and paying herself to feature in them. 🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,i feel like youtube is so toxic these days...everyone’s out here bashing this movie like chill plz it’s not even out yet. wait for it’s release then judge
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be an utter disaster
RSUq4VfWfjE,What!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen ""I have the emotional range of a block of wood"" Stewart.. should be an Academy Award winner."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah its not the same
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hold on one minute...🤢🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whyyy Sony should've just left it alone seriously 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer piss me off
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like I'll be watching this for Kristen Stewart, and because this movie just looks like complete FUN."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart's energy is stronger than the complete trilogy of twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hope it's better than the last attempt...Drew Barrymore.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen is back to her roots♥️ also, i N E E D that song asap😭♥️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't tell this and the old charlie angels apart @_@ makes me confused
RSUq4VfWfjE,You ever see a trailer and just know it’s gonna lose a lot of money
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks very meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should have just left this movie alone no reboot was needed
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley is a woman whaat? At least Charlie kept his gender
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love seeing kristen stewart like this
RSUq4VfWfjE,every movie  out now is all about girl power - women physically kicking men's butts.  .... OK
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is gorgeous.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dumpsterfire. Gender and race swaps everywhere, and a gay M. So progressive, much wow.
Shows that women can't invent anything new, they have to ripoff what a man made."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This seems incredibly bland and more basic than a pumpkin latte.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thank you
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Jasmine, WHO? & Charles How original"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass😴😴😴
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chavaaaa
RSUq4VfWfjE,say goodbye to your money
RSUq4VfWfjE,So when is the song coming out🗿
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awesome!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,can't not wait to see this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no baby. What is you doing?!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Its gonna suck. 
I promise."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flat- Uninspired- and STALE.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m not sure how to feel about it I’m not digging the cast 😕
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As a Charlie's Angels fan, I'm expecting a lot from this sequel 😣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"too pubescent, I'll skip this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is looking like a snack! 😋
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart as Charlie? You got me
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kimberly working for Rita Repulsa?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"oh great, another movie that idiots will whine about because the women on it are not trying to give them boners."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Has of now!!!!🤢🤢🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,o filme consegue ser ruim no trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kinda more excited for the song more than the movie but go off
RSUq4VfWfjE,"her smile, its cgi bruh!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"just follow me and you never regret that
push that button in subs"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Generic spy movie is generic
RSUq4VfWfjE,I LOVEEED
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where the hell is Charlie angels official theme music !!! 😡😡
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is so stunning it’s really depressing
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who would think to cast Kristen Stewart ? That person should be fired!
RSUq4VfWfjE,All i am excited for is the new singles from my girls 🙇🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course there is a girl that wants to be a boy in it...I hate our generation
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh. My. Fucking. Gosh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow what a come back kristen I am waiting to see at theatres, love you kristen looking Angel👌👌💍💍💐💐"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😐 No
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus singing in the background is the best thing of this trailer lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idc
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s garret watts when u need em
RSUq4VfWfjE,but people can we actually have a totally spies movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We DO NOT need another Charlie's Angels, unless it's a third with Lucy, Cameron, and Drew. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no🤦🏾‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so going down the MIB International path...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only that doesn’t know how to feel about this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart where have u been 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we get a movie out of Hollywood that isn't woke garbage?
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s official: Hollywood has ran out of ideas 😞.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is not Charlie's Angels without that CHARLIE'S ANGELS song!
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMFG YES A CLASSIC
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol I literally just got done watching a video about how the game for this had a glitch that broke the game 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,gonna be 100 didnt hate the trailer didnt love it gonna watch not quite sure how i feel about it but gonn agive it a shot
RSUq4VfWfjE,It will never beat the original!
RSUq4VfWfjE,DADUQ have I just seen??? Ugh no.

RSUq4VfWfjE,Seriously who thought of this waste of money?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the asian version of charlie's angels 😭😭😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,The first one was the best . Don’t @ me .
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. Kristen actually has life in her...
RSUq4VfWfjE,FLOP lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,So excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everyone talking about its great to see Kristen Stewart in this type of role.....did no-one watch American Ultra?.....she was literally the same...a total badass 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seems legit. I still miss lucy liu
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine 💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,They need jokes. Funny... jokes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Of course they gender swapped Bosley, OF COURSE they did becasue I guess it wasn’t woke enough. Hard pass!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks horrific
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waaamen
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like Liz Banks but Bernie Mac will forever be Bosley
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This actually looks great
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen maybe but who the hell is the other two faaaaaakkkkk .  they're not right for this .
RSUq4VfWfjE,💩💩💩💩💩💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies: The Movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music made me want to put screwdrivers in my ears.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Beautiful like angel.... KRISTEN STEWART ❤❤❤💕💕❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rita Repulsa from Power Rangers Villain directly Pink Ranger with half Vampire to join special team.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This should get taken back and worked on like the sonic the hedgehog movie and have everyone recasted except sit Patrick you can stay where you are
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Sir Patrick Stewart playing Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana, Miley, and Lana collabing on a song is something I didn't know I needed but hey I'm into it! Also Naomi Scott killing the movie game right now! <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wooooow!!!!! 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Maybe the can make another video game and actually make it playable
RSUq4VfWfjE,They couldnt cast an Asian girl to replace Lucy Liu???  Rudism!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn’t just smell the flop of this movie. I heard it go “flop!”
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That ""Kristen Stewart never smiles"" meme is so tired and dumb. She smiles or laughs in pretty much every picture or video I see of her. Update your worldview, people."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristin Stewart is sosexy when she decides to be a feminine girl
RSUq4VfWfjE,why does this look like the “Ghostbusters 2018” of Charlie’s Angels movies.....lulz
RSUq4VfWfjE,The wokest Charlie's Angels yet! Every race! Minimal white males! In theaters near you!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is for a younger audience.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart .... nice to c her back in action
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAH CENTURION
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Wow new power puff girls live action looks decent.*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I appreciate this cast on a Charlie angels title.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never thought I would say this... but I want to see that movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie is for the lesbians and for the lesbians only
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't call me angel..... It's literally THE FUCKING THING CHARLIE SAYS EVERY TIME?
WHO wrote the lyrics?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like a run-of-the-mill 57% on Rottentomatoes movie, but hey, Kristen Stewart's in it, so I'm on board no matter what."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is what happens when  you play gta 5.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another Feminist movie....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just glad they made Kirsten Stewart’s eyes not look disgusting for once
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring'
RSUq4VfWfjE,you’re tryna tell me that chick *ISN’T* Abella Danger?......... suuurreeeeeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think this trailer just cures my depression.
RSUq4VfWfjE,50/1 odds this movie will tank..nex!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m not mad at this. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony made this? Lol figures
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is teeeeeeeeeerrrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,The fact that Noah Centipede managed to make it in yet another movie baffles me 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG I couldn't even make it thru the trailer....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naw this remake can’t touch 2000’s Charlie’s Angels. Even the single with Destiny’s Child was WAY better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this the back history inside the movie story for the leading lady? It should be fox-five.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m waiting for the all male Charlie’s Angels reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu don’t get a cameo?!?!?!?!?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn it. They dragged Sir Patrick Stewart into this. I love Charlie’s Angels but this just looks boring & uninspired.
RSUq4VfWfjE,omfg i love it
RSUq4VfWfjE,LANA DEL QUEEN HAS COME TO SAVE THIS WRETCHED MOVIE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell yeah im so there in November
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,ABSOLUTELY GOING TO SEE THIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Princess Jasmine so FIERCE 

Yyaaayyy 💗💗💗💗💗"
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAH CENTINEO?!?! Okay I'm bought and sold lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This ain't got nothing on the 2000s Charlie's Angels with Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Lui! 😫"
RSUq4VfWfjE,And the talent just keeps getting better in the US of A.😜
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why am I seeing Noah Centineo everywhere now?! Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOO! Enough with this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aaaaaaaaaaaa
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOL!!!!!  imagine being legit excited for this trash ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'd wear that redbone out
RSUq4VfWfjE,elizabeth banks could have been an angel. and they could have generations of angels like bands in asia
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,People surprised Kristen Stewart is in a movie like this have never seen 'Catch that kid'.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tbh I'll love to watch this version with no over sexualised and predictive roles. Yes, Dew, Lucy and Cameron were a great team but this version seems different and better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pause @ 2:04
RSUq4VfWfjE,Original still looks better
RSUq4VfWfjE,Divinassss
RSUq4VfWfjE,Corny
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella Swan and Princess Jasmine uniting is the main reason I’m watching this film😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I so proud that Noah Centineo is finally going to be on the big screen after all these years of effort ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine need to chill
RSUq4VfWfjE,boring ladies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the name drop for Patrick Stewart?! The man gets KNIGHTED and no shout out in the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is worse than the game lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like Jasmine and Snow White finally met up
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can feel the 4.0 rating on IMDb
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a pos
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN SMILING KILLS ME IM TOO GAY FOR THIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame!!! And the soundtrack!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'd rather sit through an *Atomic Blonde* sequel just for Charlize Theron and the AWESOME unrealistic fight scenes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine to Charlie's Angel real quick lols😹
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is fiction women can’t fight
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m excited!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A film that features a sparkling vampire, a Disney princess, that weird lady from the Hunger Game and the real Professor X? I might actually go see this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Javi Noble sal de ahí esa no es tu película :v
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf is this unoriginal trash Hollywood is spitting out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we stopping remakes ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not even 15 years since the last one  , very courageous move"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism is bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Won't be the same without Drew, Lucy and Cameron 😳"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:03
RSUq4VfWfjE,It has a Totally Spies vibe lol but that show reminded me of Charlie's Angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Release the song. Now.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah ruined it for me lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tf is this logo ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi 😍

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart can fuckING STEP ON ME JESUS
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks.... awful... Hollyweird are really scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"pretty sure i liked the original more, was loving the ella balinska chick though"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My reasons to have interest in this:
Kristen Stewart having more facial expressions ✔
Naomi Scott just smiling ✔
Elizabeth Banks ✔
Sir Patrick Stewart ✔
Mexican bro there ✔
Ariana, Miley and Lana collab ✔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm gold star gay, but I'm so straight for Kristen Stewart"
RSUq4VfWfjE,whens the next remake of this movie 2030?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow un artista mexicano
RSUq4VfWfjE,"if sam rockwell doesn’t dance to pharaoh monch while smoking a cigarette and sipping a can of soda thru a straw, i will one-man-riot"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is Hottest Angel! If She wasn’t in this movie I wouldn’t watch it! I’m only watching because of Naomi Scott!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will see this......After Endgame👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Honestly pretty excited....don't disappoint Elizabeth Banks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Natalie didn’t spin on a chair and Dylan and Alex didn’t free fall trying to grab a helicopter for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,the sexiness is way over the top. this movie should be called Instagram: The movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,It won’t top 2000’s Charlie’s angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh great another women empowerment movie that’s going to flop. 
We already had oceans 13, proud Mary, Anna, and atomic blond. Just stop"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😲😲😲... mind blown... woooooow!... can't wait to see this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I smell another ""feminist Ghostbusters"" wannabe. *MEGA* *DISLIKE*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think i would love to see a movie about a bunch of muscle bound men working as nurses in an ER.   Equality.
RSUq4VfWfjE,And the creative part of this is...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This honestly doesn’t look bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew barimore has left the chat.
RSUq4VfWfjE,because whamen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Professor X leading X women
RSUq4VfWfjE,Complete and utter trash..more rehashing of actual decent movies to the sjw crowd..bomb factor is huge.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant beat original
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks. I'll pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummmm.....no lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sigh... another day, another remake..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks freaking amazing 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. Kristen Stewart suddenly became beautiful. Like wow what a surprise.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That would be a huge NO !
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie is SEXIST! it depicts women as mortals!!! 😤😤😤
BOYCOTT SONY"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey I know what let’s just remake all the old movies from back in the day🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Umm just so everyone knows...
This is a sequel to the TV show and the previous movies. Just saying"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this is either going to be okay, or extremely bad.

Edit: didnt think my comment would get this many likes, lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wallmart bin $1
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You could walk, professor??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is what the Pink Power Ranger did after the Power Rangers movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,how about a movie with Geena Davis and Jamie Lee  Curtis and Sigourney Weaver that I would watch not this claptrap crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chava Iglesias logró triunfar en los united states ❤️ jaja
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im sorry, but if theyre TRULY going to reboot a franchise in 2019, it requires a cast of fully gender-swapped characters. I mean, come on"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Definitely supporting this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one noticed Noah Centineo??
RSUq4VfWfjE,*I know Lana Stan’s got chills from* 2:26
RSUq4VfWfjE,I loved this. Modern. Edgy but so far not cringy. I was always down for a reboot! I'm excited!
RSUq4VfWfjE,How much you wanna bet one of them will be lesbian lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was she Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well that was the most pretentious thing I've ever seen in my life ever ever ever wow what a waste of film wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No need to compare Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu we just love them and wanted a trilogy no biggie!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stop remaking everything
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart with various facial expressions 😦 Nice to see her like this 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,i think this still needs to be retooled it needs to be more like the series the last 2 were a disgrace to the series
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weaaaaaaaaak👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not a fan of most TV reboots but filmmakers have been remaking films since the beginning of filmmaking. A Star is Born is a remake of a remake. Maltese Falcon, Scarface, every film based on a Shakespearean play, An Affair to Remember, Imitation of Life, and so on are all remakes. I'll give this one a chance too."
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Needs more thin man and blink 182
RSUq4VfWfjE,They could of got hotter actresses
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂 That was really something... now get back to the kitchen you silly women
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great, now Bozley is a girl"

RSUq4VfWfjE,What the hell did I just watch? Kristen looking fire yo!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please throw this pos away
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:32 I’m tired of these females lying
RSUq4VfWfjE,worst
RSUq4VfWfjE,There no more original movies. Everything is reruns of old stuff but the same old crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should”. It’s like the film is self conscious"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I feel like two quarters of this comment section thinks this is a remake of the 2000 Charlie’s Angels, completely unaware that THAT movie was a remake of the show from the 70s, or that this is a rip-off or somehow related to the animated series Totally Spies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley is a MAN
RSUq4VfWfjE,come on people we can do it.......  just  8.1k? keep going
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Naomi Scott’s working really hard this year isn’t she?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can’t wait for this I swear
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Many people keep saying that Charlie's Angels 2000 is way better and tbh you guys have every right to say it AFTER seeing this movie and confirm that it sucks, not BEFORE!
I love Kristen Stewart in here btw,  she can strangle me every day"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Iluminati 😱😱😱😱triangle demon 😱😱😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another sjw movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,MY THREE FAV GIRLS R IN HERE YESSSSSSSSSSSS I GOTTA SEE THIS !!! SO EXCITED
RSUq4VfWfjE,RIP Farrah Fawcett
RSUq4VfWfjE,... I’m not a fan of remakes normally. But this... I like this
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm waiting
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m definitely gonna watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm sick of all of these remakes! The only movies nowadays seem to be reboots or sequels. I want to watch a new, creative movie!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott go girl !! This is your year!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If they have a Drew, Cameron and Lucy cameo, I am sold."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Snow white, Princess Jasmine and Tiana? 😆"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Something tells me this is gonna flop really hard, I think the whole female empowerment phase of the entertainment industry is so overfilled with corny junk and just a bunch of poorly produced movies that this sadly won't stand a chance especially as a remake in the shadow of the original Charlie's Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn’t this look like totally spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Que acabo de ver 💔💔
RSUq4VfWfjE,crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait I think I heard Lana’s voice at the end of the trailer!?!? Does that mean Miley, Ariana, and Lana are all on one track!?!?!?!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Burn it , we want the early 2000s actors"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminine Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This seems like a role Kristen Stewart would hate ... Anyway nice to see her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Honestly I'm only here to hear the Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey song don't call me an angel"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Avery Bullock in life action
RSUq4VfWfjE,They needed a redhead
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMIGOSH
RSUq4VfWfjE,PC Angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Get woke go broke , least it’s on a franchise that always sucked ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cheiro de bosta...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wasn't 1:44 in the 2000's Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i think most of us are here for ariana, lana, and miley lmao"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need to see Kristen Stewart in this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie angel 2003 for ever and  drew Barrymore beautifull ! from France
RSUq4VfWfjE,Guessing a 47% on Rotten Tomatoes
RSUq4VfWfjE,"First of all bitches this isn’t a reboot, all previous Angels still exist in this universe. More of a continuation"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Long hair are actually better even if they are fake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this trailer is cool untill that Noah guy appear oop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks enjoyable. Plus jasmine actress is always a win
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This generation:
Charlie Angel of hers."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm getting a  bad vibe about this; you guys better not lean on the political extremist marketing style, it always backfires."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart once again making me question my sexuality...
RSUq4VfWfjE,How’d she have time to film this and Aladdin I’ll never know
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They are more like ""Charlie's sevens"" at best."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was ready to not see another soulless cash grab remake. But then I saw Patrick Stewart. Damnit.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this is NOT a remake or reboot, it is like a continuation and introduction of new generation of Angels ☺️☺️☺️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:01 you're watching the disney channel
RSUq4VfWfjE,What they can't cast an Asian girl.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fight scenes might be better...and better gadgets.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was thinking the other day after I saw twilight was on tv how glad I am the the Kirsten Stewart era is over but I guess she’s back and I gotta endure more of this insanely awkward actress
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott, Kristen Stewart & Noah Centineo sold me for this trailer. 'Nuff said."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've never seen Charlie's Angels so I have no idea what's going on lol 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,here for the soundtrack :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did we need another reboot? Couldn't we just have sticked with the 70's one and 2000's one.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watching Kristen Stewart in this is such a turn off
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart in this trailer looks like a mash of Jena Malone's look from The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, and Emma Watson's look from Beauty and the Beast. 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love From *BANGLADESH*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Future Razzie nominee for: 

Worst Picture 
Worst Director 
Worst Actress (x3?) 
Worst Supporting Actress 
Worst Supporting Actor (Why, Sir Patrick, Why?!) 
Worst Screenplay 
Worst Remake"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stewart is in this!? Take
My money now!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,we can blame misogyny when it bombs
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart showed more emotion in this one trailer then literally the whole twilight series plus snow white... FINALLY!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry this really makes no sense I stick to Charlie's angels w Cameron Diaz this is so dumb
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait! I hope it has an awesome soundtrack too!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,This like Totally Spies!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another failure. Especially with the Twilight girl.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will be a flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chick Flick
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love it I’m think Ariana should be on the movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg Kristen Stewart with an actual personality!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Movie looks fun, but this trailer is a mess. Too much going on."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart is smiling, Robert Pattinson is Batman. This is the year for so-overs I guess"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m sorry but as a fan of the Charlie’s angels with Cameron Diaz drew barrymore and Lucy Liu, this is NOT it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Pink Ranger, Bella, Clarice and Charles Xavier? i'm on it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen
Noah
Naomi
OMG!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Una real cagada
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just waiting for Charlie to actually be Elizabeth Banks’ co anchor from pitch perfect
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No Asian? But I think this will be cool because of that short hair girl.

Edit: Haha I just realized that short hair girl is Miley. 😂 What the hell is me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hot garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony u need to stop making movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks dumb. But I will watch this to hear Lana sing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll wait until it comes out on Netflix!
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks forgettable af
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:45 the previous movies outfits make cameos.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please don't taint the previous movies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Das
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uh uuuuunh not up in here
RSUq4VfWfjE,The trailer is alright but I only came for the song in the trailer😂🙂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a fun movie. Everyone suits their characters well and of course Kristen Stewart <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m so gay wow!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh...looks mediocre
RSUq4VfWfjE,I fricken love Patrick Stewart...feisty!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'd say the trailer isn't great BUT I AM excited for this film. Elizabeth Banks has never disappointed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,RATED R seeing nude yes RATED PG13 i guess seeing kristen Stewart is okay i GUESS!!!! wheres Charlie's Angels 3
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course Charlie is a woman!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gonna watch the 00’s version so I can wash this bad taste out of my mouth.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMG I'm crying and excited for this 💜 my queens Miley, Lana and Ariana are angels 😍💜💜💜"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Watch the feminist not even enjoy this
RSUq4VfWfjE,So they took all the sexiness out what are we left with?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:33 هييي هذولا سعوديين وش دخلهم بالمقطع 😂😂😂؟
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is gonna suck big time!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sdds Drew
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""  women can do anything""
"" Just Because they Can doesn't Mean they should""-------------- My New favorite  quote"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is anyone else getting tired of all the remakes? 🙋🏾‍♀️

SN: Kristen Stewart looks great with the short hair."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll give this a shot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't understand why Hollywood is doing remakes they already made movies for not even 15 years ago
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of the angels looks like a Karen lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"is this song gonna be all ariana cause all i wanted was to hear lana,,,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watching only one episode of the old TV show is better than all the remakes together, including this one...  Horrible trailer (and movie I bet)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Couldn't pay me to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,is no one going to finally say that we finally get to see Charlie in person
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Guys, this is NOT a remake/reboot. It's a continuation/sequel that focuses on a new generation of Angels. Like how The Legend of Korra is a sequel to Avatar the Last Airbender. This means all prior events from the films and tv series remain canon and incorporated."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess gun recoil is non existent in movies. Not to mention how deafening shooting an AR is in real life..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where the Asian chick @
RSUq4VfWfjE,but why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This was cute but when we getting the Totally Spies live action movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Show or movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hahahahaha KRISTIN STEWART hahahhahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks so hot now the girly her got on my nerves but now damn!! lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,So glad that Hollywood decided 2019 needed another remake of a classic film...
RSUq4VfWfjE,wait i thought patrick steward was gonna be bosley.... is patrick steward charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,WIGGGG
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:34 cake face cameo
RSUq4VfWfjE,THE SINGLE I NEEED THE SINGLE
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow I'm so gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a hot mess but I'm here for it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is Naomi Scotts year yeess 🤩🤩🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worst trailer I’ve seen in a long time.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Great!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ewe
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can certainly tell that Elizabeth Banks wrote and directed this flick.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't care if this is a cash grab, take my fucking money"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The original Charlie’s angels will always be the best 🤧
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wasn’t expecting to see Noah at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony seriously needs to start coming up with new ideas rather than just make crappy remakes of original movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m excited 😍 even to the mylie, Ariana and Lana song 🤩🤩🤩"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks like something thought up by a 12 year old girl who writes fan fiction about boy bands. Not only that but I'm soooooo tired of biracial women being the token black character. I saw the thumbnail image and full on thought she was white hispanic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charles Xavier is Charlie, makes sense 😆"
RSUq4VfWfjE,hard pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Cool!, its 2019 so time for Men to do a Charlie's Angeles gender switch, just like Ghost busters did a few years back, Cant wait!!! (satire)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, but this is going to flop....🤷🏾‍♀️ just being real. One well known actress and the other two we have never seen or heard of before. Nope; not gonna do well."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks amazing !
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just cant imagine a song with these two and LANA??! 🤔😂😂😂 wtf is happening here, this is the most interesting feat in a long time, im very curious"
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART. IM GAY.
RSUq4VfWfjE,should call it Chuck's Biches an hoes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I'm in. I didnt expect this before I watched. I kinda figured it was gping to be a silly comedy in the vain of 21 jump street which would have been ok but this trailer completely sold me. Also this movie will completely ramp up ppl wanting Kristen Stewart in The Batman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen and we even get a little bit of Noah definitely going to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh goodness..please no 🙅‍♂️🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watched .34 seconds. Pure garbage. Kristen stewart is blah. Hey hollywood, stop with all the remakes and reboots!!!!  As a woman I am pissed off at this crap movie 👎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I might watch this, mainly because Naomi Scott is in it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart as Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never the same like the original.. action moves are weak and not recognizable.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ari, Lana and Miley Stans, Secure your wigs."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh wow kristen is so sexy in this ahh
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer felt to me the way some people describe Michael Bay’s Transformers action sequences; I couldn’t make sense of what was going on.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart with blonde hair kinda looks like amber heard 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,They look amazing im ready to see my angles again 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"who's here cuase there a fan of kristen stewert aka TWLIGHT🙃😊

MEEEEEEEEEEE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lol, uhh...  Is that Kristen Stewart actually acting?  Never thought I'd see the day."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why
RSUq4VfWfjE,I WANT TO SEE IT !!!!! SO MUCH !!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghost busters 2.0 renamed Charles Angel's.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im disappointed
RSUq4VfWfjE,HELL TO THE NO
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they keep doing this to me!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Liked the movie but they should at least mentioned the previous ones like appearing some photos or a scene because previous girls were awesome! Drew Cameron and Lucy made my childhood ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will bomb like the 2016 Ghostbusters. Trust me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 who remembers the dress in the mannequin?? Ahh throwback 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,60/40 it's a cringy SJW girl power movie like Ghostbusters.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ugh
......no"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You did this with Ghostbusters. This is gonna fail too! We get it, you hate white men. That is not something to say out loud."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me:  Sponsored by Audi.

Kristen Stewart:  ‘Gasp."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks Fun.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Straight to ppv.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Naomi Scott is so CUTE?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like Kristen Stewart's quote at the beginning. I'll see this movie when I get a chance.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Stop the touching, some of these blows up"" 😂😂😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Unnecessary, corny, silly, girl-power remake that is no different than any other trailer where I see a smart-mouth woman beating up and shooting men in action sequences that defy logic.  But I'm sure everyone will go flock to it and this will spawn a ton of sequels.  Hollywood movie making at its ""best,"" you can't come up with anything new so you recycle something old then make every ""new"" version of it look like every action movie trailer we've already seen."
RSUq4VfWfjE,More people of colour please.
RSUq4VfWfjE,whas that noah?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is dead
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott? 🙀😻 i wont be silent....


I stan 💪🏻😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,wait... is this totally spies?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hope this one have more than one season
RSUq4VfWfjE,just a waste all around
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just saw all movie in 3 min ! .Thank you youtube !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shouldn't they be all males?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is the only reason I will watch this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WHY CAN'T ARI, MILEY AND LANA BE ANGELS?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"X-girls? And proffesor X?

😂😂 gotta see this new Charlie’s Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,When I’m more excited for the single than the movie 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"okay to everyone thinking this could be totally spies which was a very stupid cartoon to begin with. this is no where close to being totally spies they were teenage girls in high school. this is the second attempt at charlie's angels on the big screen after a failed attempt at it on the small screen a second time around. but,instead of bosly being a man we now have him as a woman who is also the host of the new game show press your luck.


this is just another classic franchise of old school television being destroyed by the big shots of hollywood who don't know well enough to leave things alone."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Puke. What a steaming pile!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,NEVER EVER replace the originals
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn't even realise that was Kristen until the they flash her name.
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's weird to see Kirsten Stewart in this type of role :O
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s going to bomb 💣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another one ? How unoriginal.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yea totally spies  wow who would thought to bring that cartoon to life well here it is ,  oh yea looks like a  poor movie trailer not impressing , and of course guy hate , well at least we have the original version much better"
RSUq4VfWfjE,*tongue click*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The fact that they missed the opportunity to make this a Totally Spies movie baffles me!!!😑








Thank you for the likes!😃🙏🏾"
RSUq4VfWfjE,lol yeah I'll be watching 'Ford v Ferrari' instead of this garbage. Nothing beats a guy's movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmm hopefully they make Naomi’s character actually a fighter cause how would it even be Charlie’s Angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,i love you kristen stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is the Drew Berrymore of the angels omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,Spice girls anyone? 😂

RSUq4VfWfjE,Cmon Luis Gerardo Méndez let’s get sickening
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OK... I'm a child of the 70s (and hopelessly in love/lust with Farrah, rip) so this is almost obligatory for me to see."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow!!! Can't wait to see this in cinema.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh for fucks sake more feminism.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Eeeeeeee, that was cringy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen Stewart looks like Avril Lavigne...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just what the world needed, a CA reboot. Is Hollywood that short on ideas?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't fucking wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought that was abella danger lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did you all miss the costume from the other movies??
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just come for Ariana Grande:3
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw Kristen Stewart so i clicked
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Estou muito anciosa, pra ver o novo trabalho da minha querida atriz Kristen Stewart sou apaixonada por ela sou muito fã, não vejo a hora da estreia das Panteras com Kristen Stewart 😘🥰

RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristens face on the thumbnail tells me she trying to squeeze one out....or thats just my face?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me or did Kristen Stewart get hot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh...I'll pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They're trying to hard. A lesbian white girl, and 2 minorities. Why not have a dude as one of the Angels. Maybe a trans angel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is kristen stewart hot all of a sudden?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here to Lana's part of the song. All I hear is whisper! I need more
RSUq4VfWfjE,This music does not fit at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Steward is so fucking sexy. Shes a dirty kibda sexy though, not sure I'd actually go for it, but I mean, shes hot to look at lol."
RSUq4VfWfjE,They can't come up with anything new can they?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's angels? More like charles angels.


Ok sorry"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love the Audi product placement...
RSUq4VfWfjE,FFS.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,My indian girl jasmine looking pretty. But Kristen Stewart. Dang it loooks so swag! Dominated the trailer. Looking ageless.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Been forever finally releasing a new one
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:23. I'll betcha she learned that from Mater.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should’ve made a movie with Lana Del Rey Miley Cyrus and Ariana Grande instead.
RSUq4VfWfjE,better than twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Because the new Ghostbusters and Oceans 8 did SO well.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like an old navy commercial
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imagine how *sexist* this movie would’ve been if it were a group of dudes beating women’s asses
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see the yoddling dress from Charlie's Angels 2000
RSUq4VfWfjE,The pacing feels off
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG this looks awesome!
RSUq4VfWfjE,boo no me likey!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Saw Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey and thought they were in the movie. I thought ""wow this is going to suck.""  Yet, somehow they managed to make it look even worse."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flopping Angels. This movie looks awful.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ehhhhhh, well that s a no for the film from my side. well loved the Kristen Stewart role."
RSUq4VfWfjE,people are already judging it with out watching it!! typical
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana doin' soundtracks again! I OMG I'm crying!

RSUq4VfWfjE,Eeeeeeek I see you niomi first aladin now Charlie's angels 💖💖💖💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: Ariana Grande, Miley cyrus and Lanadelray collaborated?!OMG
Taylor Swift : you need to calm down."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel lost I only came here for Lana and Ari?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella Swan after deciding to leave the Cullens and become an international spy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is every movie being remade? Next we'll probably see Titanic and Ms. Congeniality remakes. Btw, Kristen kinda looks like Avril Lavigne."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Kristen Stewart! She’s an awesome actress and super hot. I’m pumped to see her in this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart  she's Class!
RSUq4VfWfjE,3 espiãs demais🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks trash and cheesy
RSUq4VfWfjE,This should be funny. Three little girls beating up large men. Hilarious.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,love elizabeth banks but this seems like an awful role for her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think Kristen Stewart has Asperger’s Syndrome, anyone else?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The name is the only thing that resembles the original... another PC piece of garbage. Hollywood is pathetic and devoid of anything decent
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has FLOP written all over it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Está uma merda
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame.
RSUq4VfWfjE,SUPERFLY Charlie’s Angels Columbia Sony

RSUq4VfWfjE,"drew, cameron, lucy. i will forever love these trio. but i just trust elizabeth banks! okay? and also naomi scott 😍 different role for kristen ugh im so gayy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another idea for scary movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,This year's deep thinker movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw Noah and was like wait omg is that Noah Centineo!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Quem lembra das 3 espiãs dms, da um like. Braziiiiiiiil 🇧🇷"
RSUq4VfWfjE,set the video speed to 0.25 now start watching the head butt 0:28 see where her head actually went ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nahh.  Not interested!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok if things blow up why hit it out of her hands 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay Kristen Stewart is one of the only reason I want to watch this
RSUq4VfWfjE,i’m here for ariana🖤😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,only care about this movie for the single
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ah yes, I don't think we have enough female empowerment in 2019. We need more man bashing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yessss !! I so want to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did they just forget about crediting Patrick Stewart?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*I thought Ellen just make film debut*




Ariana's voice is never disappointing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did they eliminate all bad comments? Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh I'd let Kristen Stewart kick me in the face 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Q bosta
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's this porno called
RSUq4VfWfjE,A remake of a remake!? How original Hollywood!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not interested
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stewart saying ""FEISTY"" was my favorite part"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks absolutely stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only seeing this for Noah Centineo 🤷🏾‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,This doesn't look like a heaping pile of trash. I'm excited.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I WANT THE SOUNDTRACK NOW!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hi I'm Gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why do I see a crossover between these angels and Hobbs and Shaw happening in the future? Remember me when it happens, I called it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well at least they're hot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another Useless Liberal BUST!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,That girl that played Bella looks so confident and cool in this movie. I want to watch it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,hearing Ariana Grande in the background cured my soul!!! 🖤🌫
RSUq4VfWfjE,TIL Elizabeth Banks directed the new Charlie's Angels movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feels like it should be on Nickelodeon.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just don't see how Hollywood has any time to eat or sleep with all these original ideas they keep coming up with.
RSUq4VfWfjE,If they are going to make Bosley a female doesn't stand to reason that the angles should be men.  I mean in the interest of fairness and all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"at first i was like ""huh no one wanted this but ok"" then i realised they just arbitrarily made everyone except charlie Women they even kept the male names"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know I'm going to be a bit biased here but I think Tom Ellis would have been perfect for this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another remake, where's the creativity?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,wet blanket version of the previous ones
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So not only do I have one set of angels, I get another? I’ll take it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,.........
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want Lucyliu Drew, Cameron... They are angels in my memory. Sexy, cute, mature, smart and witty. And these three people are like the trio of campus bullying…"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Taking bets bella acting skills for this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally. A feminist movie I can actually get excited for 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlies angels(2003) then totally spies then this version of charlies angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,when you get a movie but the song takes all the credit :v
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angels or totally spies lol...
RSUq4VfWfjE,OH WOWIE WOWOIE k stewart  i'm in love
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I felt like I'm on a gigantic crossover xD with Bella, jazmine princess, professor x, and every teenage movie a watch on my teen years xD but I'm OK with it i want to watch this I'm really  curious how is gonna be"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The outfits from the earlier movies tho ❤️❤️  1:43
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks boring meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:

2019: “remake everything that doesn’t need to be remade”"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like a pretty standard Hollywood remake, nothing mindblowing but a quick popcorn flick with action for a random night on the weekend/ Love me some Kristen Stewart but prolly watch once but not more. Title track is basically the same pop song i've been hearing out of the west for the last 2 decades, could use something more interesting at this point tho probably fits the movie fine in terms of it's predictability and standard structure."
RSUq4VfWfjE,IS THAT NOAH CENTIMELLON
RSUq4VfWfjE,"dogshit remake, hollywood is out of ideas lmao"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yayyyyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to fail so hard!
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT NOAH!!!😮 I can't believe he is in this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wahmen can do anything!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its only fitting we get an all male remake after ghostbusters and oceans eleven get their all female remakes
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's almost impressive that Kristen Stewart has been in Hollywood for as long as she has without ever being tempted to learn how to act.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I definitely want to see this 😍 and she has definitely developed as an actor since Twilight 👏🏾
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can beat that Lucy lui burger scene 😤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah graduated from Netflix 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,I nearly spit out my tea with gay joy! 😍 Kirsten Steward🔥 🥰🌈🙏🏾
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cardi B could easily be one considering she drugged and robbed men and got away with it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg. Two of mah favorites... Naomi and Kirsten
RSUq4VfWfjE,My ice cream melted because of this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,“We exist because traditional law enforcement can’t keep up”......LMFAO
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still confused as to how a 110lb woman beats up a 200+lb man.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nostalgic remakes sponsored by Audi
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This sucks. No one will top Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lui, and Drew Barrymore"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Garbage, yet another tired remake."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn Bella actually looks kinda hott & actually worth fighting over now!
RSUq4VfWfjE,There is so many fleeting moments i saw Justin Bieber there. Women Empowerment movies = Justin Bieber hair?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg!!!!❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already hate it. Thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gotham City Sirens look sick!
RSUq4VfWfjE,SO SONY let me get this straight. In the age of gender swap reboots you decide NOT TO MAKE THIS WITH MALE LEADS??? Props for going against the norm but you all had to gender swap Bosley??? You were that close smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen so beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Once upon a time there were three very different girls,
Who grew up to be three very different women
But they have three things in common
They're brilliant, they're beautiful and they work for me
My name is Charlie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,missing some early 2000s r&b hip hop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fire
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like kristen stewert shows some promise in this. looking forward to it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,PASS👈😄🇺🇸
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Woah Woah Woah, was that Tom Cavanagh at the end?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lowkey I thought the girl in the red dress was Abella danger oof
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not a big Charlie's Angels fan, I'm still watching this for the sexy female leads and that dope song in the trailer."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally! A movie where kristen stewart has her mouth closed!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"As if that cast wasn't enough for my gay heart, they put Janelle's song on the trailer 👀👀"
RSUq4VfWfjE,cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart as Sabine from the totino's skit
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If you're going to keep deleting  comments and dislikes, just disable the feature, quit being a b****."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is the cutest! I really love her!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont like!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does Hollywood insist that women can’t be strong without a butch hair cut?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Get back in the kitchen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oof this looks rough
RSUq4VfWfjE,F.... Still recovering of goshtbooter and now this the originals of these movies are much better than this what happen with make New movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is what happened to Professor X after Dark Phoenix
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks about the same as the last reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,What pompous asshole  decides to direct a movie (that's not even their original idea) and then casts them self as the iconic behind-the-scenes 'director' role? Talk about insecure
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why dnt they cast an all Male cast for this next time. See how that goes down
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The jokes, keep it coming!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hi. I would like to pander to everything. 

Thanks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,again?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like this cast
RSUq4VfWfjE,Um whoever cut this trailer music needs more practice or the song was just bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie is a joke to the original charlie's angels smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait a new single by Ariana Grande+Miley Cyrus+Lana Del Rey? How does that even work??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies....😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMFG
RSUq4VfWfjE,It was better when you needed imagination to make them lesbians.... Now what's the point......
RSUq4VfWfjE,This compared to the old Charlie's Angels is pretty bad lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have mixed feelings about this (another..sigh) reboot from Sony....need too see more before I judge
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Honestly, who's asking for this unnecessary s**t?!!!! It's wasting amazing talents of Naomi Scott, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Djimon Hounsou."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just here for Ariana ft. Lana Del Rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,La constipada sonríe... Wowwww
RSUq4VfWfjE,"eiza goonzales, kristen ritter and vanessa kirby are my angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,How tall is that woman 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's so cool!
RSUq4VfWfjE,hmmmm. nope!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whoever wrote the script for this movie should be decapitated and their head should be placed on a pole as a warning to others.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Seriously????
No way I will watch this!!!
Can’t Hollywood come up with anything original anymore???
Don’t think so!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Que vergas hace el chava iglesias ahí???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Whack!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does everything this year have to be a remake or sequel?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I never thought I would say that, Bosley is HOT !!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this reboot can never compare to Charlie’s Angels(2000)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another remake...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not sexy enough from charlies angels to totally spies they were sexy and smart ugh not watching this pandering bs
RSUq4VfWfjE,It doesn't look interesting. It's like they made something other than Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not feeling it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ew
RSUq4VfWfjE,I mean the Drew Barrymore movies were terrible but at least it looked somewhat like Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yay Kristen Stewart already awesome just to see her in action, the music is horrible tho, i expected some jazz classy music, not shity pop."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Djimon Hounsou seems to be repeating his 'Never Back Down' character
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is dead
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sir Patrick Stewart and Elizabeth Banks were the highlights for me. If someone can get me to watch this, it's them."
RSUq4VfWfjE,i will cancel everything if kristen stewart is not gay in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please don’t make these characters into a Mary Sue fest. 🙏🏻😕
RSUq4VfWfjE,"oh no, from sony entertainment"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So basically it's a movie about Bella from twilight protecting Princess Jasmine with Professor X in x men then her friend is flirting with Noah from To all the boys I've loved before.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is a continuation right?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2 females and 1 male as Charlie’s Angels? 
Strange choice. 🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Donno how I feel about... but imma gonna watch it 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie doesn’t need to exist
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like the actresses but this looks quite bad. I will probably watch it on tv in some months
RSUq4VfWfjE,Take her to the closet  . Kristen Stewart is Lesbian  .  2 + 2 = 4
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a garbage MTV music video plot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dear Patrick,  i hope that between now and the premiere the full extent of your friend ian mckellan's friendship with bryan singer will be exposed"
RSUq4VfWfjE,garret your dream came true!
RSUq4VfWfjE,As long as there are camos
RSUq4VfWfjE,A female Bosley! That’s...original.😒😒😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for Naomi. 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,TF is the soundtrack?! It's only what I came for. It's rubbish. I was thinking of Bang Bang kinda vibe but I got a demo tape of high school girls decided to make a song because they're wasted.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh. Stop rebooting stuff.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for the soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:32 
""bad guys"" 
* *shows middle easterns* *
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
2019? Almost 2020? And we're still doing this?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Daniel who??  A blonde james bond!!!! That'll never work
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen ♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:50 I thought that was Abella Danger
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why I'm skipping this movie 0:08 smh 😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a SJW version of Charlie’s Angels... 🙄
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:27 1:57 1:59
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks dumb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mmmmm not iconic enough 😑😑😑😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,could be a star making role for that blonde boy Chris Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay but the editing for this trailer is trash! Woah can you maybe not switch up the songs so much and put the story line in a notable order
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ah, another original movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im sorry to say that, its a trash. 
Still cant beat trio Lucy, Diaz and Drew"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Powerpuff girls
RSUq4VfWfjE,should be Kristen Stewart Daisy Ridley and Jennifer Lawrence
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh they made a live action Totally Spies movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Worst cast of a new Charlie’s Angels. Uugghhh, Kristen Stewart especially!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen stewar i Love beautiful 
❤😍🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The thing is everyone just hates reboots because this world is filled with toxic trolls that don't like new stories of a wonderful franchise, honestly I'm looking forward to this movie!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,**male virgin voice** oh no! The feminist are taking over
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ve never been more offended.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,No way.....i want to see part 2 of part 1....not feeling this boo boo....this ain't right🤨 This is just another movie....not Charlie's Angels????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: Hay Hollywood please make new movie we haven't seen before.

Hollywood: No we're going to continue releasing remakes and sequels to movie from 25-50 years ago so go F yourself."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not really for me, i never been a Charlie's Angels fan so this didn't click with me. Hey if enjoyed the trailer and look forward to it then that's cool."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks incredibly generic and cliche
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bosley isn't and will never be a chick on any version of the CA franchise periodt.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Once upon a time, there were three little girls and they were each assigned very hazardous duties. But i took 
them away from all that, and now they work for me. My name is Donald."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It’s not a Charlie’s angel movie without the original trio, I’m sorry but no thanks 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghost busters remake all over again
RSUq4VfWfjE,Major flop incoming
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT 💙💙💙
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meanwhile Drew Barrymore is like 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uh oh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks fun.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ARIANA GRANDE YASSS

RSUq4VfWfjE,These 3 women together couldn't lift 100 Lbs . And none are Hot enough to draw men to this mindless piece of PC BS .
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already don't like it. Why isn't one of the angels Asian? 😌 it's also not the same without that kickass redhead leader 😣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not feeling this cast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is one of them a little blonde boy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmin??

RSUq4VfWfjE,Going to be a bigger flop than booksmart!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The early 2000 Charlie’s Angels was the standard this doesn’t come close follow me on Instagram thoe @angelzulu_
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still can’t believe Kristen Stewart is in movies 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That will be a hard pass. I know Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz will support this because its Hollywood and if they dont they will get blacklisted unless they fall in line, but damn I wonder what they really think. R.I.P Bernie Mac!  Glad you dont know about this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a joke smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks kinda basic BUT hopefully the movie is way better than the trailer 🤷‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where TF is the single???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yuck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not interested
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg are u telling me people can’t get any original ideas for fucking movies they have to remake the same damn ones???

RSUq4VfWfjE,Trailer is too long!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too bad it’s going to suck and ruin the franchise lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's going to flop. Should have gone straight to Netflix 🤦‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess sony had a little extra change in their pocket to make a total crap movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Take my moneeeey!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,arent the angels supposed to be sexy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow they look so much more better than the originals and sexier too!

RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No gracias, me quedo con la versión  de Cameron, Drew y Lucy👍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They do not make any effort to make movies anymore.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uhh, this sucks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,send the twilight girl to my office and deport the other two
RSUq4VfWfjE,Morning Angels 💓💓💓
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow this movie is going to fail hard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,💩💩💩💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana del Rey brought me here!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be extremely ridiculous just because Kristen Stewart is in it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've seen more Kristen Stewart's smile in this trailer than all her other movies combine.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girl Power Yay !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*GONNA BE TRASH .*
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴

RSUq4VfWfjE,They honestly couldve named this totally  spies instead
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’ve watched this trailer so many times just to listen to Lana. Mom, plz release the album"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did the producers forget to hire a personal trainer for these girls? They look like they couldn't even lift a bag of groceries.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like I just watched the whole movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m officially sad because I’m a 90s baby and this just breaks my heart 💔

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Will Cameron, Drew, and Lucy see the new movie? I can feel it! 🤞🤞"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great, they remade Charlie's Angel's with women!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gayyyeeehh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I know the movie will suck just for the Radio Disney soundtrack alone.  Pity because I have a soft spot for Banks.

RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so bad I couldnt even finish the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don't like the song or the logo. I am fine with the rest.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks dumb as hell! 👎🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yo! This looks 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hollywood has officially ran out of movie ideas, there trying to remake EVERYTHING from the past"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No comment
RSUq4VfWfjE,oki... it was either naomi scott or abella danger...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course with today society they would make this an all female cast.    Lolz.  Jk.  You sexist idiot.  Got em
RSUq4VfWfjE,mehh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"just change their names to alex,sam, and clover"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Couldn't even make it through the whole trailer without gagging , no way I would sit through entire movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chava Iglesias
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why even call it Charlie’s Angels if it has no similarities to the movie or the tv series?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bonie mckee BOMBASTIC 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like the load I dropped in the toilet this morning
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Lana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im Looking More Forwarded To The Song Release Instead Of The Movie😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm going to watch this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:
Sony: Random Reboot, that's what the people want 🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,My suspension of disbelief can't handle 90 pound women doing karate and taking down men 3 times their size... sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage 👎🏼
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love you 😘😘😗
RSUq4VfWfjE,MAIS UM FILME RUIM👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That was a roller coaster of emotion.

Ugh, another Charlie's Angels reboot.. 
...Kristen Stewart trying to act again.
OH! Patrick Stewart? Awesome! 
Sigh.. unnecessary dance numbers. 
At least Naomi Scott looks cute... 

I'm so conflicted."
RSUq4VfWfjE,yes please
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okkkk the trailer looks amazing!!! I can't wait to see this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,They shoulda made an all male remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks stupid.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So the pink ranger and Rita repulsa join forces, recruits Bella swan and a girl named Ella then formed the new angels with Professor X as charlie?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Liz and Naomi <3 So excited for this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love it! 😍 Can't wait!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Y’all hating on this movie even if it hasn’t come out yet. Nothing can get to please you... well what I’m sure is this movie will still sell because it will be watched by younger people. Actually, that’s the market of this movie. 

I love Drew, Cameron and Lucy being Charlie’s Angel. Their already an icon. But I’m not a type of person who doesn’t give a chance and doesn’t appreciate new comers who would want to play concepts from an old movie. People are so toxic, full of negativity."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i hope im wrong cos i like everyone involved in this, but that was a weak first trailer"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The Best part about this trailer is at 1:44 there is a nod to the Barrymore, Diaz, Liu Angels with some of their outfits from their, WAY BETTER version of Charlie's Angels!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks fine. No real issues but it just seems a bit too laid back? Like they’re not taking the job seriously or something I guess, but I never watched the original so I don’t know the tone."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nahhhh. ..Lucy lu can kick all their assess. Sorry girls. Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels starring 12 different autotune pop songs cutting in and out senselessly, without any rhythim to match with the film's editing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,4
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What Men Want, Ghostbusters, Ocean's Eight, Men in Black, Hellboy...






Sorry I'm just going with the math on this one"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I’m gay for this reason
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes!!!! NAOMI SCOTT!!! From a High School Rockstar to a Power Ranger to a Disney Princess and now becoming a Secret Agent.. Yes!! The girl is fire!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""aNgELz""
""yEs cHaRliE?"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart in that blonde wig 😍👀
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, I don't hate the tailor....guess I may see the movie when it comes out online."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i lasted 6 seconds, that set of lines in an audible groan from me followed by a hard no"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Umm bella and princess jasmine?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope!
RSUq4VfWfjE,miss grande sent me here😳
RSUq4VfWfjE,"one word:


nothanks!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,And the white guy is still the bad guy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No lie, I used to be anti Kristen Stewart but the trailer shows she's grown as an actor and now I'm very intrested to see her in this

Also the other angel's eyes?! Are those fucking CGI, they are HUGE! Seriously this girl is beautiful"
RSUq4VfWfjE,More originality out of hollywierd.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im surprise they didn’t make Charlie into a woman lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to be trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks worse than Charlie's Angels Full Throttle. I hope I am wrong.
RSUq4VfWfjE,💩💩💩💩💩💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOOOOO!!!!!! This ain’t it chief.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This fake empowered bitches trend is getting more and more annoying brah.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This look dum
RSUq4VfWfjE,RIP my memories of the original
RSUq4VfWfjE,More trash from Sony
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Hollywood that out of ideas they rebooted something that's been rebooted from a TV show? That's really sad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol wtf is this crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gonna be awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Bella Swan is now an Angel. And Edward Cullen is Batman. And Professor X is walking....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’ve seen this one before...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry but NEXT!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tiene muy mala pinta
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song sounds like a bop 🎶
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course there’s another closet
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies live action?? 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,First Edward as Batman and now Bella as a Charlie's Angel? Stop fucking around Hollywood..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wheres the redhead and the Asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is securing that bag
RSUq4VfWfjE,why did this get so many dislikes? I don't understand
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watching because of Kristen Stewart. This is different from her usual genre of movie, so im excited."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have a question...
WHY?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart actually looks really pretty in this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Reboots is Hollywood being completely Lazy and unoriginal.
What happened to the Movie industry these days"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just because you can reboot something doesn't mean you should.....again
RSUq4VfWfjE,What terrible casting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,A handsome nerd lmao
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tranny movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Isso é um filme de comedia?
RSUq4VfWfjE,🇧🇷🇧🇷
RSUq4VfWfjE,Plot twist: Charlie is also a wahmen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like Elizabeth Banks on Hunger Games, but this Charlie's Angels is soooo generic. It lacks the 2000 over-the top mood and parody core. Now it is just a cliche action movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another anti-male femtrash. Nothing new.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man, these women are handsome....."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Try hard anti male nonsense.
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤦🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Drew Barrymore is my favorite Angel.😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oof, a feminists dream has come true. They'll see themselves in this movie, while tweeting about why they hate the letter ""B"" in lgbtq..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will watch anything Elizabeth banks does/is in
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bernie Mac, Bill Murray > that one chick who plays the same role"
RSUq4VfWfjE,No amount of Picard is gonna get me to watch a Charlie's Angels reboot without McG and Crispin Glover.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ummm, no thanks"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't know what I should be more excited about, the movie or the soundtrack 🙌"
RSUq4VfWfjE,BR?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah tho 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here for Kristen Stewart 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did anyone realize they released the trailer today which is also the day charlies angels fully throttle was released June-27-2003
RSUq4VfWfjE,We have been fooled before. Not buying into it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony Pictures did not learn anything with ""Ghostbusters""."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Es basura,es basura,es basura (sr sherman) xd"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg!!! noah is in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible. What a surprise
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look another failure of a franchise
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah!
RSUq4VfWfjE,was gonna watch the movie but saw Noah centineo😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,If I dont get a cameo from AT LEAST Drew Barrymore we're gonna have a problem.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Finally, we have some badass group women movies!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels
Why not called Angel's Angels
Me:""Here we go again.""
Sooner or Later"
RSUq4VfWfjE,MEH
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah give me back the old angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is humor is more like totally spies and not Charlie’s angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My questions is, when did kristen stewart become attractive? 0.0"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this low key looks kinda cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood has officially ran out of ideas. Remake after remake ugh!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi is the shortest and the cutest !!!😭😍😍🌎❤🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow! Kristen, Elizabeth, and Naomi???!!! This is going to be  an AWESOME movie! 😍😍❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im More Proud For Elizabeth Banks , For Directing ... She been the game a long time"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look another remake! Man that never happens.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn’t look like a bad movie but this trailer was kind of a mess.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie’s angels and Charles Xavier... I see what they did there.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another reject remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"More feminist propaganda is being  forced into the movie industry.
 Which unfortunately continues making women  look stupid and unnatural."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"but why? the original was fine, this just feels really tacky"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks bloody horrid.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I bet it takes in less at the box office then the ghostbusters reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i’m more excited for the single with Ariana, Miley and Lana than i am for the movie itself."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana grande
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they have to keep remaking movies that were bad show to begin with..get some imagination!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol Amber is showing how she beat Johnny Depp
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All-Girls Ghostbusters = OK
All-Boys Charlie's Angel = NOT ALLOWED!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's Farrah Fawcett btw?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look. Another reboot we didn't ask for. Smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,well its nice to see Kristen Stewart not look stiff in a film for a change
RSUq4VfWfjE,Heil Ariana!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The ''jokes'' in this trailer are pretty rough.
RSUq4VfWfjE,*WHO?*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I so wanna give this a shot but in the back of my mind all I can see is glittery vampires 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so fucking bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope it doesn't turn into a male bashing movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to like this. I really want to
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope the ""independent women"" song play in the end of the film"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think this trailer had every cliche that exist in film history.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHERE. IS. LANAAAAAAAAAAAA🤯
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not interested in this movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"🤦🏽‍♂️




This movie is a mistake and will flop big time, like Ghostbusters (2016), Oceans 8 and MiB (2019)..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yeah, no. Even lowering the standard down to intelligible, Kristen Stewart is just an emotionless plank💯"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This film looks so  totally awful, I coudn't stand to watch the complete trailer, it's a shame that Patrick Stewart has been roped into this load of complete bollocks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart smiling is something I'm grateful I lived to see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This better be rated R
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm only going to watch it because of KRISTEN STEWART. It's going to be fucking awesome and will be huge at the box office. Stay tuned, Oldsters!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man, I do not want to see this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry but Cameron Diaz, Lucy Lui and Drew Barrymore will always be my Charlie's Angels. But hey at least no identity politic BS... Hopefully."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Even the trailer looks box tickingly dull.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do they keep remaking movies they should leave alone
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This doesn’t look half bad. Less campy than the last reboot. I’m pretty sure I’ll enjoy it. Not a theater flick, as I’m forced to limit that to only the most FX heavy—both financially and physically—but something to enjoy on Netflix. I’ve enjoyed watching hyper-competent women since I would sit and watch their original predecessors on an old black and white television.

I’m not terribly nostalgic, but certain things just ring my bells. If we can’t get an updated Jamie Summers, we can at least get Angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks fun!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,how in the living hell did noah centineo get here
RSUq4VfWfjE,"LL Cool J: ""Uhhhhh! Another movie from an old TV Show."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,It has been forever since the last time I saw Kristen Stewart!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ugh..pass! Small skinny girls who weigh less than a $buck,look like they need a meal and im supposed to buy theyre badass?.. the other angels were comedic action so it was ok."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Houston, we got a problem with this movie..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,That is a NO. Steaming hot garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Justin Bieber a Charlie's Angel??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This will follow in the footsteps of Ghostbusters, Oceans 8"
RSUq4VfWfjE,# Hardpass surprised bosely wasn't transgender
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg I'm sooooo watching this with ma girls😝😝😝😍😍😆😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naaah  don't have the elegance of the angels of the '70s or the humor of the '90s, they stay in the middle of nowhere."
RSUq4VfWfjE,sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should remake this with all men.
RSUq4VfWfjE,i didn’t know i needed this revamp but now i am SO HERE FOR IT!
RSUq4VfWfjE,yeahhhhh... nah.
RSUq4VfWfjE,what with all the 90s movies coming back did yall run out of ideas or we just dreaming
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ghostbuter SJW = 175 millions lost
Ocean SJW = 110 millions lost
Soylo a soy story = 200 millions lost
Mortal engine = 200 millions lost
women in black = 150 milllions lost... Get Woke ! Go broke !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This didn't need to be made in the 70's. It didn't need to be remade (although a standalone Drew Barrymore/Lucy Liu action picture would have been welcome). It definitely doesn't need a reboot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It looks more generic than the previous attempts to adapt the TV series to the big screen, but it also seems to take itself at least a little more seriously (possibly even on par with the original series, which was fun without being a self-parody). The McG films arguably devolved into camp, as if the idea of competent female private eyes were something that couldn't be played straight. This new film also seems to be toning down the most common criticism of the entire franchise, namely that it's nothing more than ""Jiggle TV"" for the male gaze. It's still there somewhat (especially with Kristen Stewart), but it's not on the level of Cameron Diaz dancing in her underwear. We'll see if director Elizabeth Banks actually keeps this level of restraint in the finished product (and if Sony will let her do so)."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This will be a box office hit.
I can feel it.
1 billion is coming ✨"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks sexy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Beep boop take all my money
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so in.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Doesn't seem tight for me yet, specially the fight scenes, but let see how it goes on the next trailers..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it odd that I have no problem with a female Bosley
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why is Bosley a woman? I'm still interested but if this movie gets anymore cringy I'm out. OG Charlie's Angels was girl power enough and all this pandering has gotten old.

Money is right and my family doesn't have time or money to waist on propaganda; we want quality action films with real characters not modern day Spice Girls."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can we just a moment to appreciate Kristen’s beauty 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would pay $20 to go to the movie theater and just listen to Ariana’s verse in the new song
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope they asked charlie’s actual angels to be on the sound track aka Destiny’s child
RSUq4VfWfjE,They need to say that iconic line better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Stupid👇
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is to woman what Tyler Perry is to black people.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look like a dumpster fire. It's gonna flop. Sony must really wanna got broke. Way too many woke movies in a row.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Uh... we did not need this. No one needs this. Cameron, Drew, and Lucy are perfect and need no remake. Wtf are you doing."
RSUq4VfWfjE,🎵 The feminist are taking over... I'm an adult virgin🎵
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lol, this looks awful."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need more Lana and less Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does it feel so sterile?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"More than 100 faculty members, students, and healthcare providers from two colleges in Alabama were shocked to learn of the state-sanctioned organ harvesting in China, when they attended a series of events held on October 25 and 26. 

The documentary Human Harvest was screened at Spring Hill College on October 25. Two forums on this issue where held on October 26 on the campuses of Spring Hill College and Southern Alabama University Medical School. 

Three speakers answered audience questions, including David Matas, a well known Canadian human rights lawyer; G. Weldon Gilcrease, an Assistant Professor in the Oncology Division at the University of Utah School of Medicine and a Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) member; and Yu Ziqiang, a Falun Gong practitioner who was tortured in China. Falun Gong is a traditional spiritual discipline that has been brutally persecuted by the Chinese regime since 1999."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The colourset left something to be desired it looked like tv
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks cheap
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks dumb lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm an old I like more of the mystery/story than the high tech/cgi. Kristin Stewart = horrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a shitty female version of kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In movies women use their wits and skills to get the job done.
In real life they use their body...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Solo vine a escuchar a Lana respirar
RSUq4VfWfjE,.............LOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why couldn’t it be an all male cast ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna flop so hard
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have one question, who is charlie and where is he?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,That start fight looked weak bad stunt team bad lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I'll wait for it to be available for streaming.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why have they cast Kristen Stewart smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks so meh. It doe snot even look bad, just boring and generic."
RSUq4VfWfjE,wait where is Drew?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ew
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So even in women led series, supporting male roles go to women when it's rebooted?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for this to suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where... where is the Lucy Liu equivalent?
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:43 no one gonna bring up my man johnthan tucker?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell a bomb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, but this is going to fail miserably!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Solo por lana diosa entre?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cool another movie where a 5’ 5” 104lb girl(kirsten Stewart) can beat up any man lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noahhhhh 😍😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I mean, it looks _promising..._
But it’s _yet another_ remake, and in a world where remakes aren’t making bank that bodes ill."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is one of those “don’t fix it if it ain’t broke” situations.
RSUq4VfWfjE,waaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"um. naomi? kristen? noah? 

i can’t wait to see this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,My response to Kristen Stewarts line in this. How did this movie get made because it looks really shitty.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garrett is shook
RSUq4VfWfjE,"the movie isn’t even out yet and people are already complaining, like stfu for a moment maybe?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only person I like in this trailer is Luis Gerardo Méndez.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm actually excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,Loved it! ❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,i just came here to press dislike
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sorry Cameron Diaz but this is what you get for ditching your fans
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey Sony..., this is stupid! What're you doing!?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤦‍♂️ why do they keep making movies replacing the lead roles with women
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didn’t we just have a Charlie’s Angels movie not to long ago.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Better looking than I thought possible. Should've had another name. Tasteless reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disappointed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the definition of Hollywood giving us a movie that no one asked for
RSUq4VfWfjE,Needs more Sam Rockwell dancing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMGGGGGG !!!!
The return of Kristen Stewart ❤️❤️❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be a firm NO for me
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WOW!!
This
Is
Just terrible!!!!
I mean (facepam) really RREEALLLYY terrible."
RSUq4VfWfjE,One word. Boring.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"American movie＝Trash
European movie＝awesome
Asian movie＝Best"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart was the best part
RSUq4VfWfjE,I AM STOKED!
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤢🤢🤦🏼‍♂️🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m tired of Hollywood putting these teeny tiny girls in action movies. As if they can take down these men or even handle the guns they are holding. Im not small and I had a hard time shooting a regular shotgun let alone what they show them with. 
STOP HOLLYWOOD STOP!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Хуета как и предыдущие фильмы
RSUq4VfWfjE,The feminazis would hate this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thots begone
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope won’t be watching
RSUq4VfWfjE,this will bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,We need a Charlie’s angels with Georgina sparks and Blair Waldorf
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks way better than the train wreck I thought it was going to be when they cast Stewart.
RSUq4VfWfjE,that's cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Alright. This is crazy. I feel like I fell into a coma, and I got transported back to the early 2000s and the late 90s. All these movies coming back, all these cartoons being made into live action movies, or I might just be going crazy here lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLIE'S ANGELS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Since there are no men being born today, now the women are shootin, fightin, cussin and killin folks.  All we want is a samitch...  We dont want all that, make my samitch...  MEATBAAlls!   oK oK you can save Venus tommorow, get in that kitchen woman and make me my ssssssamitch.  Thats all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charle’s Angels and Kingsman should do a crossover to take out the IMF from Mission Impossible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,sony: im gonna give the gays everything they want
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another beloved franchise that goes down the drain.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So ariana's ain't in this. Ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm getting a real MiB reboot vibe from this... and we all know how well that worked...
RSUq4VfWfjE,box office bomb incoming
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi is AMAZING😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miley Ari Lana Kristen Naomi .....yessss
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm just excited about the soundtrack and the fashion looks.... but hey maybe it'll have some cool action too.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, this looks mediocre at best even from the trailer...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,We demand diversity and inclusion.  The next Charlie's Angels must have Male leads or the will be branded as sexists agents of the matriarch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait..... Aren't Charlie's Angels suppose to be Hot? Now it's just Bosley who's hot!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look another remake thats doomed to fail
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:53 seconds I’ll never get back!!!! 💩💩💩👎👎👎
RSUq4VfWfjE,What year is it?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im just over any nd all reboots, remakes or watevas at this point"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gonna bomb,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yessssssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only gonna watch this movie because of lana del rey.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chalie Xavier´s Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,how many of you wants that old iconic tune?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella Balinska looks so badass in this I’m excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 👏❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks worse than the previous REBOOTS.....just another grand example of Women Power only in Hollywood!pshhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Stop casting women who can't act and have no charisma, just because they're ""pretty"" or popular."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi before she filmed this : "" Alright No More Riding Magic Carpets, I'm taking this Goddam Crown off My head and time to kickass again Cause Rita (Elizabeth Banks) Need Me."" Lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,бабы-ловцы призраков? говно. бабы-косящие под мужиков? хуета ебаная. боевые шлюхи? вот это я понимаю!)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wanna watch this but I gotta be honest, the pacing and how they presented the premise in that trailer felt awkward. Too many cuts imo"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn another remake how lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hmmm idk
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella Balinska looks so hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love Kristen Stewart, but, I just can't see her in action movies & this role was not for her."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm debatable
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You can keep your feminist woke b ull sh it crap. Go woke, go broke. Not getting my money."
RSUq4VfWfjE,omg can't freakin wait so freakin excited and having Naomi Scott as one of the angels is amazing loved her as princess jasmine <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,SJW ANGELS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who came here for Ariana and Naomi Scott?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Do we know who is voicing Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I find it incredibly sexist that the reboot to Charlie's Angels is not an all male cast. It's 2019 Sony!
RSUq4VfWfjE,IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR AGES
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah cements really in this one huh?
RSUq4VfWfjE,One word FUCKINGHOT
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m going to see it because I love Naomi Scott & Kristen Stewart. Djimon Hounsou & Sir Patrick Stewart is a pleasant bonus. The theme song sounds like it’s going to be heavy handed but I like Ariana’s music so I’ll give it a listen. All in all this movie has all the makings of a box office success that’ll probably end up bombing
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah didnt like the first movie dont think I like this one either. I'll watch it when its free ajajajaja
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont know. I need another trailer. Missing something.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still a no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,More reboot trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kingsman rip off
RSUq4VfWfjE,Get woke go broke
RSUq4VfWfjE,Niomi Scott is on a roll with these movies!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already can't wait for Cinema Sins to run through this
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like it’s going to be the most charismatic & animated role Kristen Stewart has ever played & I’m here for it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Man this looks fun, but that sound track is very corny, can never be as lit as the originals"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This look bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't call this Charlie's Angels, anything else but that"
RSUq4VfWfjE,PASS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chick flick. Men will be forced to endure this because of their partners.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ari, lana, and miley stans dont know what to do here bc we came for the soundtrack"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I recall long time ago this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Noah, please voice a character on the new NETFLIX SHE-RA cartoon.*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They are not hot 😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,me listening to “don’t call me angel” in the background w/o knowing anything about this film
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here by ariana ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana brought us here!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No more Rebots sony
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m going to stick with the original charlie angles,i don’t know how to feel about this reboot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dripping in s@*t.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thought looking at thumbnail this was a tv reboot... They could have done so much better. Looks a pass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah. I don't think so. My money is safe.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"One flop, coming right up!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks is an ego maniac, her name popped up enough times to make it look like the opening credits to The Room."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg fucking cringe first oceans 8 then this bs ughh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why couldn’t we have Charlie’s Angels 👼 3?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is this giving me a Totally Spies vibe?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is gonna flop so hard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤣no words
RSUq4VfWfjE,Still a better love story than...... You know the rest
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:04 Noah eating a sandwich 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another woman heavy movie, I’ll pass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh. Just more unoriginal garbage.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Coolest movie of 2003.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Spoiler Alert: Charlie is also a woman...Girl Power!!! 😝
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only part I'm expected about is the soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,Um miss the one with Drew Barrymore
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,LANA DEL REYYY
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh dear lord I can’t wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In the future if people (or aliens) look at the movies that are made now they're going to think, ""Wow. Men were really awful and women hated them so much""."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Leagues better than the Batwoman trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella returns
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This has my full support because I hate new, exciting ideas"
RSUq4VfWfjE,These girls don't come close to the strength and class of the OG 70s angles.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've got some high expectations for this movie. First note: no one can replace the original Charlie's angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice one..im really expecting this project..you guys can support my channel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Prefiro 3 espiãs demais
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks okey but it doesn’t really seem to stand out among other similar movies.. Can’t wait for that Lana, Ariana, Miley song tho"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Powerful and brave whamen. 
Soo stronk !"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"of course this has to be filled with black, arab, latin and short haired woman.
2019 in a nutshell!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen stewart punching a guy while Janelle Monae plays on the background is the triumph of the gay agenda
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not feeling the tall one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nice. Belle is here
Time to get hard"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ah I can not stand that chinless wonder..Noah

Why people think he is attractive is beyond me :/ even uglier when he smiles"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flat-chested Feminist Charlies Angels.  Yikes. :/
RSUq4VfWfjE,😖😣😖😫😖
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please no.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Just because you can make a Charlie's Angels reboot, doesn't mean you should."""
RSUq4VfWfjE,lolz! Why the black gurl have to be light skin ? She's almost white. Also this is a typical affirmative action Hollywood movie casting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism can be happy now!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is top billing!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song listen like art 💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,those explosions look horrid haha
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm still gonna watch this movie no matter what, but I do have one thing to say. It definetly did not feel like the old Charlie's Angels at the beginning, but it definetly started feeling like it towards the end. I'm here for the girl power and the comedy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry Angels, but Professor X was the best part 😆😆😆"
RSUq4VfWfjE,haha love they showed some costumes from the other movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ha! Hell's yeah look's crazy fun; and a new crew, oh yeah.
Grew up watching t.v. series love all the movie's so far."
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOL THIS IS GOING TO BOMB SO BAD LIKE MIB LOL 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,What's this ? Another portrayal of frail stupid little men groveling at the feet of women. Oh my.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only thing that’s exciting about this trailer is the soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG WIG
RSUq4VfWfjE,AWFUL
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What is even going on in this trailer lol. Also, sweet TERMINATOR font"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yo this looks bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This doesn't look as bad as female Ghostbusters but it does look really mediocre. However, one bright spot is Ella Balinska (had to google it); she's the only one that seems fit for a Charlie's Angels movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks awful and plz stop with the remakes Hollywood
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nahhh I am going to wait until it’s on Netflix. 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Check out the Charlie's Angels trailer - proceed to singing don't call me angels?! WHUT?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,SKIP!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A new definition of mediocre, nothing new and nothing original."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If Bosley is a girl there is nothing more feir than the angels be boys, it will be sooo much fun 😂😂😂👌🏾"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels protect Princess Jasmine With Professor X.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Haran una cameo nose pero siento que las originales haran un cameo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks amazing! Can’t wait!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Quem é do Brasil
RSUq4VfWfjE,"why if an asian dude plays the villian isn't a problem, but if a black does its wrong?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There are a lot of close takes (I mean, camera distance), it seems too close and often for my film taste. Don't like that aspect."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ahhhhh young Bellaaa 🧛🏿‍♂️ 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sigh.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yes, the dull, vacant acting of Kristen Stewart will definitely make this a hit.👎🏿"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Movie looks fun, the song is rough"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I could barely make it 40 seconds through this trailer without cringing a few times. Of course the bad guy in the beginning was stealing humanitarian aid money. Of course the girl is a ""lead programmer"". And of course they had to make the background music some nauseating pop song instead of a real soundtrack."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Liked the trailer after a few watches but that first part with Kristen Stewart saying “who steals humanitarian aid money” is so cringy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 🔥 She s amazing 😍 Woaavv
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why sell to us bad remakes why
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh yeah! Finally the all-girl power action packed movie that women never asked for and men never wanted to watch in the first place. Guaranteed flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks bad 😐😐
RSUq4VfWfjE,"IDFC WITH YOU ALL COMENT, IM GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pile of crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow cool 👍 I'm so going to watch this movie in theaters
RSUq4VfWfjE,RESPECK THA WHAMEN DUDE BROS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"00:02 Oh cool, thanks for the introduction telling me I'm going to see the Charlies Angels trailer right after I CLICKED ON THE CHARLIES ANGELS TRAILER."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yea no thanks. Tired of these remakes give me something new that i haven't seen
RSUq4VfWfjE,But why Noah Centineo? That's going to ruin the whole movie for me. But oh well I'm still gonna watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay Charlie’s Angel fans this not a reboot this is a sequel……a independent sequel
RSUq4VfWfjE,No redhead??? We need love too :'(
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t like it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m sorry but this will never top Cameron, Drew & Lucy...and the ICONI Destiny’s Child single Independent Women!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh look another one dimensional character because Kristen Stewart can't act.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WTF ,yesssssssss❤❤❤❤❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana Del Rey 💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""were gonna need some wigs"" shows wigs "",toys"" shows horses "",clothes"" shows clothes.... now idk how you play with horses but that's no toy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn Kristen go off
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cade os br?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wheres  Ariana Grande?
RSUq4VfWfjE,GhostBusters 2019?!?!?!?!?!!?!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only watching because MO is in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one asked for a remake

This will bomb like Humans in Black International"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They replaced the Asian girl with a ""light skin"" black girl
-but whyyyyyyyyyyy?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Fimenist
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no! another lesbian-gay propaganda
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I guess everyone knows Patrick Stewart, so he didn't need a name credit. 


Oh,..wait,...he's a man. Can't have that."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks really entertaining. I'll watch.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks fun
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of Power Ranger to Princess to Angel 🎉🎊🎉🎊
RSUq4VfWfjE,"In a world of ""feminism"", gender role reversal, and movie reboots....
Comes another movie reboot... with more ""feminism"".... but no gender role reversal!


Your parents may have watched the TV show....
You loved the first movie, with an actual story...
You tolerated the second movie... with the guy from the first Transformers....
You don't remember the TV reboot, with the other guy from the second Transformers...



Now get ready, for the millennial PC reboot, with more fashion, more cars, more ""feminism""....
and, most importantly....MORE BOSLEYS!


Seriously, there are like four Bosleys! Do Bosleys never hold a tele-conference meetings? How does Charlie refer to one Bosley without confusing the other?
Also, none of them are Bill Murray, for some reason...
Did the Ghostbusters reboot convince him to not participate in reboots anymore? Awww...


Meet the angels, a team of three women... 
Their powers involve... seduction, acrobatics, assassination, super-stealth, wigs.... 
And most importantly... FLAWLESS MAKEUP!


Starring....

Negasonic Blonde Airhead
Michonne Kim Possible
Jasmine Salander


Also, starring:


Director Bosley
Professor Bosley
Finnick O'Bosley
Solomon Bosley
Token hot nerd cameo
Big Speaker
And most importantly... A MALE ANTAGONIST! 

CAPTAIN AMERICA'S SECRET DAUGHTERS!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boring. Soyny, keep trying though."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I agree with Jeremy from Geeks and Gamers this trailer is boring as hell. Get better content please or it will be a snooze fest and I guarantee I won’t be seeing this trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don't care about the movie tbh I'm  only waiting for the Ari, Lana and Miley collab"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Bosley a woman in this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m just trying to hear Lana’s part man but I can’t 😭😭😭😭 it’s KILLING me
RSUq4VfWfjE,Throw this whole thing away
RSUq4VfWfjE,no one ask for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course there is Noah Centino.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm... I see you Noah 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Worse than worse, how can we let mistakes like this happen 'Hollywood'."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, at least they didn't make Charlie a woman"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had to watch this trailer 4 times because I kept getting bored...... it looks like a high budget D-list movie like those foreign films on Netflix
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sometimes I wish they wouldn’t change the genders for no reason I’m looking at you bosley. Doesn’t look right sorry.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks great ... I hope its as great in full
RSUq4VfWfjE,Probably gonna have to see another trailer to get properly excited. Looks alright so far.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"É a mesma coisa que ""As panteras"" taokey 👉👉. No tocante a tradução!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bruh Kristen Stewart killin it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll have to review this on my channel. 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is probably the baddie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,anyone else hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so bad not watching
RSUq4VfWfjE,Se ve mega mala.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Mmmmm jajaja nose que pensar de él personaje de naomi va ha ser interesante verla actuar de una manera que no estoy acostumbrqda😁😁😁😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony jus doesnt learn. Another FLOP!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Honestly, there's not much to say. This movie looks like its once again going in a more comedic route like to first two ""McG"" movies. Granted I don't have a problem with the cast, but the fact that they gender swapped the ""Bosley"" character makes me concerned that this movie is going to push a female political agenda ala ""Batwoman"". And all this is coming from a guy who barely watched the original TV series nor those previous two movies."
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂😂😂 it’s the batwahmen all over again
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible. It’s honestly an abomination. They should have left the “Charlie’s angle’s” name out of it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes! K-Stew. Im here for it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Audis.  Oh,, sorry,  ""Angels""      

This product placement makes The Avengers look tame.  :/"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’d rather watch paint dry
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm not sure how I feel about Kristen Stewart as and angel? Idk what do you guys think.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wouldn't watch this for free
RSUq4VfWfjE,"yeah, because reboots MIB:International, Hellboy, Shaft II & Godzilla:KOTM were such smash hits... give me a break.. no, I have no intention of seeing YET ANOTHER mindless TV show remade into a mindless motion picture.... I don't blame Elizabeth Banks, who's shown herself to be genuinely talented for helming this, but r u serious?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,rehashed Hollywood garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay but we’re going to need cameos from ALL of the previous Angles
RSUq4VfWfjE,"dang, finally Kristen Stewart gets cast in a role that lets her act"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh they’re easily forgettable
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess this movie is taken for tax purpose !! RIP Charlie's Angels reboot !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"CA's was produced in the 70's specifically as a showcase for three attractive women to traipse around in as little clothing as possible, with a 'plot' having something to do with fighting criminals.  McG's ridiculous movie version basically followed the classic premise, up to and including John FOrsyth's voice. My prediction? Hard BOMB.  I'll wait for Wonder WOmen 1984."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where is the new Lucy Liu/Asian girl in this?? 

This cast is bad. You could’ve used Constance Wu or Lana Condor"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"“The feminist are taking over!”

“I’m an adult virgin"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This shouldn't be a thing
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna awesome like Ghostbusters and Ocean's 8! Girl powerrrr!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Interesting, I will see this for Patrick Stewart"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just like ghostbusters 2016 oceans 8 n any remake that puts in sjw agenda is trash n will always be trash because they are not original at all
RSUq4VfWfjE,The new theme song of Charlie's Angels is sounding 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Do y’all remember that SNL skit that Kristen Stewart was in about totinos pizza rolls? 

Do you remember her characters name?

OH YEAH

SABINE ANKAKAKAKSKS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Say anything you want about this but you can't deny Kristen is looking drop dead gorgeous.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Jane is British being played a Brit, I think.
But Naomi, A BRITISH PERSON, is playing an American. Makes sense."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"LOL 😂Another remake fail again, first MIB now this😂is dey fr or wuh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yoooooooooooooo
Im so gaaaaay"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too much sass. Doesn't look original or fun. McG's films at least were a bit more tongue-in-cheek.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m kinda into it?
RSUq4VfWfjE,É tipo três espiãs de mais?
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:08 That guy looks like a young Mark Ruffalo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Again?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girl power ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, THAT looks fucking fun."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"K-Stew
Naomi, too
Ella B and Destiny
Charlies Angels, c'mon
Uh, uh, uh
Question..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,So I swtiched this trailer off at Bosley being a woman..... why not Charlotte's angels.... let's cut all the penises off....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh wow! Kristen Stewart can laugh...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna fail... another shitty remake we didn't need or ask for...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"UH, WOMEN CAN BE BOSLEY TOO SHITLORDS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This really looks like a follow up. Charlie's Angels are underrated. The movies were so funny. I liked the trailer, it seems to channel the fun from the originals. I need a cameo from cameron, diaz and Lucy just like the Angels from the tv show did in the films."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cant wait!!! Kristen stewart 🔥🔥😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just watched a music video lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,You would’ve been better off taking this movie’s budget and investing it into Bitcoin lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i guess they're not as super human this time around, but it still looks interesting..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I""m afraid it's gonna be a no from me, dawg."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yuk
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so excited for this! All three actresses going to bomb! 👏🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,I guess they wanted to make a version for the current 'generation'
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think just about every man in this trailer was killed is brie Larson directing
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was it the Chad? 😂 That scene better be in this horrible remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,Got BROKE written all over this wokefest 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uhh... no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noahhh centineoooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here for Ella Balinska!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look it's a reboot reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another one? 😐
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen better have at least one lesbean scene.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not even Bosley can be a guy. Hollywood forgot that men still exist.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So every movie with a all male cast gets remake to appease feminism, why can't they make a Charlies Angels with dudes? hmmm"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can’t hear Lana’s part, whyyy???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awful 🤢🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella? Where's Edward?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, a plus is that these three chicks are hotter than the chicks in the last Charlie's Angels remakes. However they still are not as hot as the original Charlie's Angels. But who is. Only 4-5 women in American history have ever been that hot.

I think the moment for Charles Angels has passed. Charlie's Angels was 3 perfect 10's, if you believe there is such a thing, on TV at a time when people just could not see that kind of beauty every day. Most people didn't have cable TV, there was no internet, and VCR's hadn't been invented. There were three 3 big TV networks. There was very little bandwidth for images to be broadcast. If you saw something you liked like you had to wait a while week for it to come back around again. Against that backdrop, Charlie's Angels showed America 3 perfect 10's to men who, not only had never seen a woman that beautiful in reality, had no way to even see a picture of a woman that beautiful.  These days seeing beautiful pictures of beautiful women is commonplace; such images are disposable."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bankkss!!!! But still love the old Charlie's angel. Lucy Carmen murray and drew
RSUq4VfWfjE,bravisimo🙌
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Youtube: How many NPCs do you want to attract with this movie?
Sony: YES"
RSUq4VfWfjE,female bosley? oh why? Bosley was already a gender swap. Silly man next to strong badass woman. Why they have to change that? This movie will fail like the other gender swapped.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Bring back McG."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I wasn't sure about this Miley, Ariana and Lana combination and now that the trailer was released I still don't like it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What absolute pile of garbage....get woke, please choke"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It can't be worse than the 2000s ones... Right?
RSUq4VfWfjE,If one of the OG angels doesnt make a cameo then what is even the point?
RSUq4VfWfjE,ANY SMALL CHANNELS WANT TO SUPPORT EACHOTHER ?💘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks promising
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ohhh, I already love Kristen Stewart in this role!! She’s sooo adorable and sexy at the same time!! Totally not letting my husband watch this!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Now, they are using GUNS!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Disliked for SJW garbage in the beginning, I wonder what else are they hiding ? 🤔  🖕🖕"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is cool ..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Usually a trailer gets me excited for a movie....this did the opposite!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg a new Angels movie yayyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so bad...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Enough with the reboots and remakes! Give me something new!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*omg, they r so pretty!!*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, I HAVE A FEELING ITS GOING TO BE MY FAVORITE ALREADY FROM JUST SEEING THE TRAILER ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here for all the comments (DNT care much about this rebooted reboot)
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m surprised the movies not named Elizabeth banks angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sooo kingsman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sooo, nobody's going to say something about the "" are you flirting with the handsome nerd"" scene?😂

I'm going to like mi comment to not disappear xd"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sooo looking forward to this 😍❤😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks alright
RSUq4VfWfjE,Só sei que eu sou a Naomi Scott na brincadeira 😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where are my Male Angels at Hollywood?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like a movie that will be panned by critics for sure.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WAAAAACCKKK.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii dont know what tf to say
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHAT DO YOU MEAN ANGELS THIS IS CLEARLY *TOTALLY SPIES* WITH SIR PATRICK AS JERRY!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood in 2k19 YIKES
RSUq4VfWfjE,Better be a Tom Green cameo.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine WTH are you doing here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What's the L word I am searching...




Oh.. 
L A M E.

Idiocracy is a documentary after all..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's 2019 where are my 3 independent lead male actors
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,90s making a comeback
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another reboot,  another flop... looks dire!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:28 this is everything
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not for me sorry... Stop doing movie that not follow with the original actors
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yall are really about to test kristen's acting skills
RSUq4VfWfjE,“Some of these blow up” hits it out of the hand
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry will never beat the angels cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy liu"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The blonde should 
of been played by grav3yard girl 😉"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"just for ari, oh yass"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm watching this mainly for Naomi Scott.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,3 out of 10
RSUq4VfWfjE,First time seeing movie put soundtrack singer on priority for promoting instead of actress
RSUq4VfWfjE,Quero
RSUq4VfWfjE,"We’re in it together, but don’t call me angel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,lol offbrand kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,i hear Lana breathing only at the end of the trailer. I still fuckin stan. 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The song is so generic, sounds cheap. I like the previous one, actresses in this one overacting, in my opinion."
RSUq4VfWfjE,OUCH !
RSUq4VfWfjE,ENOUGH WITH REBOOTS! Do you really need to see TOY STORY 57 and Rambo 78
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never like the classical Charlie's angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wanted to watch it until nona centimeter appeared
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miss  diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I am genuinely so excited for this movie??
And I’m so here for Kristen with short hair. 🔥🔥🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to bomb so bad. Nothing unique or interesting about it. Won’t even live up the last two movies let alone the series.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The angels used to be hot women. Now look at these teeny boppers and the twilight chick all tom boy'd out. I mean wtf seriously.
RSUq4VfWfjE,NEEDS CAMP. 'THIS IS HOSTILE YAAAH?'
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Thank you Hollywood, since you have been putting out such crappy movies, I have been saving lots of money."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Lesbian Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bella, Kimberly and some other chick??? No thanks... Professor Xavier omg yes I'll definitely go watch it now."
RSUq4VfWfjE,another complete piece of crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn't this look like Kingsman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Stewart is supposed to be the Hot one?  Yea not interested... not even a lil.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Naomi Scott always cute
RSUq4VfWfjE,IM SO EXCITED YES KSTEW
RSUq4VfWfjE,Let’s go
RSUq4VfWfjE,The background music sounds terrible... but I guess you can’t top the last lead soundtrack Destiny’s Child “Independent Women” 🤷🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 are the clothes from the original 😱😱😱😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies Live Action
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait is that girl with the hair cut from Twilight
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why I get at the end a totally spies vibe
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is this a joke??? You even hired Kristen, the worst actress since Bella🤣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i'm not convinced tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WHERE IS ASIAN CHICK , NOT WOKE ENOUGH FOR ME 😜😘🤦‍♂️  !!!!  



👎👎👎👎👎💩💩💩💩💩💩"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is so so much prettier with long hair.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ehm... Where is my Journey music? Nothing will beat the absurd scene with the helicopter in Angels 2. :D
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's totally disappointing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lili’s story?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was hoping one of the angels would have been trans but *sigh*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love her short hair <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh i thought this was a show
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this going straight to Redbox?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm unsure how to feel about this. The only thing I know for sure, a hundred percent is that I LOVE Patrick Stewart as Charlie. That might be the only reason I see this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"FANS : Jasmine is the best Role naomi gets 

NAOMI : HOLD MY WINGS!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,it would be much better if  they just cast the 3 kardashians.. it will be a blast!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like absolute trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's From ariana grande ?!??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only here for Noah 🤷🏾‍♀️ Everything else blows...such a let down tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Might be worse than that failed TV show.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks stupid.  I like it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana Del Rey - I'm sold
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Nada!!! I am too much addicted to the old Angels. Can't betray them!!! Sorry!!!* 😑😑😑😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miley Miley Miley queen
RSUq4VfWfjE,now when will this come to netflix
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reboot is going to be BADASS and I am here for it. I can't wait!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh goodie.... Another remake pop up.
What else is new?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is playing Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"When will we get all male cast Charlie's angels??
How about some diversity?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,cool but where's the asian?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Should be an all male cast cuz....2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOSLEY WAS A GUY OMG. SERIOUSLY?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women empowered
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girls shooting guns that's fucking hot 😎🤘🏿🇲🇽
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not sure when your gonna learn,  Sony :("
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well I think I'll watch Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore as Charlie's Angel instead."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Here for Lana’s voice and, guess what? I barely could hear her... disappointed af!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That looks great :) suprise to be sure :O
Charles Xavier, Jasmine, the twilight girl, the servant of Thanos...    ...that's a nice cast :D"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Vai ser uma merda
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi MVP
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'M HERE FOR LANA'S VOICE
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't hear Lana...
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHAT IS THAT AWFUL HORRID MUSIC THEY ARE PLAYING? TERRIBLE!
RSUq4VfWfjE,YAWN
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*What's better to start a new movie of a franchise decades ago, with Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana del Rey*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So excited about this new Totally Spies Movie!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Kristen?
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAHHH 😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,For Charlie’s angel standards these girls aren’t that hot and they changed the hot Asian to a black chick and they also missing the red head
RSUq4VfWfjE,love that twilight girl's look
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another remake? Yeayy?..... Urgghhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy Liu. With my girl, Drew.
Cameron D and Destiny, they are NOT.💅🍵"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I LOVE IT🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*This looks Really boring.. . .  * 🙄
It was hard to make it through the trailer.. tbh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Οy vey they are on to us!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can you put more forced diversity ? Thanks !! 🤣😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Meh, I'll wait to watch this until after it comes out on cinema, the full HD digital release, the Blu-Ray release, one year to go by, 0 seeds on torrent, then I'll stream a cam copy and watch it in 480p on my 4K UHD TV."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who’s here because of Lili Reinhart’s story
RSUq4VfWfjE,cringed pretty hard at this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn’t see Noah coming lol he’s like everywhere😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf where’s Lana’s voice y’all mofos !!!????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well this is a video that blows
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen ♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Women can do anything. In Hollywood they only use them for their bodies
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont see it for me but ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah CENT ANIO?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Só amei! Briga de saltos, vem vem."
RSUq4VfWfjE,But why..?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else kinda wanted a different cast? I mean I bet these 3 will be okay but...I don't really know.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is how i felt when teen Titans go was announced... and it that's not clear: disappointment. Immense disappointment.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No......
RSUq4VfWfjE,Get WOKE go BROKE!
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLIE'S ANGELS JR ??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Logical part of my brain: this looks like it's gonna be bad
Gay dumbass part of my brain: hhhhnnrrrg Kristen hot"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was a little worried when I saw Kristen in the thumbnail... but she actually looks great. I’m pleasantly surprised.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The background music ruins everything
RSUq4VfWfjE,That song is terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I'm defiantly not watching this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well this looks awful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lili Reinhart ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn the theaters are lookin like throw backs rn...
Toy story
Chucky
Godzilla
Men in black
*Soon to be* 
Lion king
Charlie’s angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am pretty sure this will get a <5 IMDB rating out of 10 when it releases.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Хороший трейлер. Сразу понятно, что фильм - говно."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is looking real pretty in this.  I would see it just for her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Um
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait... Kristen Stewart is hot? Woah. My whole mindset has been changed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one who cringed  a little knowing Kristen is in this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Back ground song is awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmin is on the wrong set.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another SJW spin
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Every once in awhile, in every movie, Naomi Scott looks like a young Sarah Michelle Gellar..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks really bad as most movies are nowadays
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want a remake with Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz!!!! MAKE IT HAPPEN HOLLYWOOD!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart should play Tracer in the Overwatch movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why tf is Noah Centineo in this, gawdddd. The most overrated actor right now 😪"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope the pace of the actual movie is better than this trailer... it's so Disney Channel :S
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope. Nope. Nope.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'd rather see Fez's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,How woke can we go? Common Sony you can get woker than this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here before 1m who else
RSUq4VfWfjE,Complete failure
RSUq4VfWfjE,this has the trumpies triggered
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont even like it...
RSUq4VfWfjE,No...
RSUq4VfWfjE,IM SOOOOO EXCITED TO SEE THIS I LOVEEEEE KRISTEN
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Nothing could be worse than Ghostbusters 2016*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hahaha hahaha no man why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMG the movies industry is so bad since last 4 years... 

All the movies now are made for LGBT."
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO NO JUST NO STOP!!!!!!! LEAVE IT ALONE. I GREW UP ON DREW BARRYMORE LUCY LIU AND CAMERON DIAZ LOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I hope Naomi sings *Speechless*

That's gonna make me literally *Speechless*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So what's K-Stew going to be depressed about in this film...
That IS why they hire her right? To be melancholy + miserably hetero-questionable?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is gonna flop really hard😂🤦🏽‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don’t call me angels - Ariana Grande new single 😱😱🖤🖤🖤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart. So hot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So cool I might watch this movie (:
RSUq4VfWfjE,They should just go all the way 'woke' and hire Nicole Kidman as Charlie tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great! Let's change the sex of characters whom originally were male because it drives a narrative, not because it actually fits into the story. Welcome to 2019 folks, where every character on Movie/TV screen is going to be played by a woman because it totally makes sense, right!? Why weren't any oft the ""Angels"" male? Yeah this is equal rights in the making🙄🙄🙄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This doesn't even look like a action movie... right I probably won't even watch it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok I have no problems with the female movement but all im saying, don’t make a traditional men cast and change it to women like ghostbusters.. but take a women’s role movie like this or wonder woman and make it better... And don’t do a skinny girl like kStewart able to beat up 4 big security guards like they were paperweight, or in supergirl: Superman is more powerful plus more experience and yet supergirl beat him like he was nothing... Stop using obvious and cringey line like Batwomen “the hero we need is her”... And finally stop the men hating movement, again like batwomen “ I’m not gonna let a man take the credit for a woman’s work”, I mean come on she took his suit/gadgets/emblem/and trademark"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Steward is still alive? Uh-uh. Not that i bothered, but nice to know. Did she at least learn to use more than one expression in the meantime?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,throw the whole movie away
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The way they took their wigs off is unsettling, were they trying to snap their necks?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart actually looks like a perfect fit for this movie, the other 2.... not so much, looking forward to the movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh, okay"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen is so funny
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks like a television series
RSUq4VfWfjE,Amaziiiiiing Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This would have been a better cast.
Drew Barrymore - Melissa Benoist
Cameron Diaz - Cara Delevingne
Lucy Liu - Liu Yifei
Bosley - Jona Hill"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe at🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,er............ another blockbuster
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Where the hell is the Charlie's Angels theme? Not even a 2019 remix or sample? The original reboot with Diaz, Liu and Barrymore looks way better."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This reminds me of Totally Spies
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie is already Great all because Naomi is in it😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,🙄 y'all always coming at movies that has remakes but this isn't even a remake it's a continuation. So fucking annoying. People said the jumanji  movie was going to be horrible but everyone turned out to like it. It's not even out yet just wait till it comes out before you judge💅🏾
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naooooooomiiiiii😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Effie Trinkett from Panem’s Capitol, Bella Swan from Forks and Princess Jasmine from Agrabah"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song is actually annoying
RSUq4VfWfjE,Get woke. Go broke 😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If movies like this annoy you I have great news, There are literally several other decades to choose from. Thousands of movies. I suggest the 1950s."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Me too angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll give that a solid watch
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing about this over excites me yet.
BUT, with that being said...

- Kristen Stewart looks great, I hope this puts her back on the map.

- How was Patrick Stewart not credited!!!

- Elizabeth Banks owns each role she's given, I wish this one great success.

- Cameron, Drew & Lucy need to make a cameo appearance, PERIODT!

- I'll still watch it anyway."
RSUq4VfWfjE,hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Speechless truly something is seriously missing i am not a critic more like a lover of action films but still
RSUq4VfWfjE,Man I'm already gay for Kristen's character
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm really anticipate this movie omg. I hope that in this film they still keep the jokes like in the two previous films. And i'm hoping a cameo from the previous angels (Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore). Tbh i still love the old movies tho.

(Sorry for my bad English)."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The other girl resemble Beyonce 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Lana Queen?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sponsored by Audi
RSUq4VfWfjE,Super awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart always sounds like she’s overdubbed her voice afterwards lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Looks like a straight to streaming service type movie to me*
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has FAILURE written all over it. A film for idiots in search of easy masturbation.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm a bit disappointed there isn't a remix of the actual Charlie's Angels theme (made me a fan when I watched the original film). I'm still holding out hope seeing Drew Barrymore making a cameo as Dylan, but highly doubt it. :c"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They swapped the gender on Ghostbusters why not on this....I want my male rights!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music overlay on this trailer is sooo annoying
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Kristen is Drew, Naomi is Cameron and Ella is Lucy?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think they should have had each angel with different hair colours like the classics, one red, one blonde and one brunette."
RSUq4VfWfjE,That music was REALLY annoying
RSUq4VfWfjE,Surely I’m not the only one who thinks they each need a bit more individuality?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music for this is ummm something else...
RSUq4VfWfjE,came for ariana and found out naomi is here too I love them so much
RSUq4VfWfjE,Luis Gerardo Méndez is the fucking latin power!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here for just Naomi scott..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pathetic
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony, this is 2019! no need to say that the trailer is in HD in title!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley is a woman? That’s not how it works, that’s not how any of this works."
RSUq4VfWfjE,ARIANA GRANDE IS HERE
RSUq4VfWfjE,ok ok the thing is why do movies always portray them as hella skinny? irl you cannot take down a 250 pound man if you’re that skinny
RSUq4VfWfjE,._.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had hard time to figure out who’s the third angel. But eventually there is a shot at the end.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only here  for Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a new take on Charlie's Angels. I am sold.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another feminist movie, how original."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That's an awesome trailer...
But I miss drew Barrymore"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is back
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another box office bomb courtesy of Sony
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yawn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's Angels is over do for a gender swap . The fact that those characters are still women in 2019 is sexist and not very progressif . Its discrimination to nonebinary , transgender and attack helicopter ."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, it although doesn't look great, I was expecting so much worse. But I'll watch it only for Patrick Stewart because I LOVE PATRICK STEWART! Even if he'll likely hardly be noticed throughout the movie TT"
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know it's bad when people are more excited for the soundtrack than the actual film 🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so woke after this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Someone should cast me and my brothers
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've never seen Kristen Stewart more animated.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yet another Hollywood swamp movie that is gonna to execute mega-levels of suckdom
RSUq4VfWfjE,give kristen gf
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have a feeling this movie is going to bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Can't handle the cringe, this looks horrible"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Karbrüggen, my man!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else peeped the American onesie in the closet from the previous Charlie’s Angels  🤘🏽
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i need to watch the original... ooops

but i’m so excited for this!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,omg I love the cast pheww well minus noah centipede
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart 😍🥰
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I swear I thought that was Bebe Rexha in the beginning.




Also: Hell No👎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ew no
RSUq4VfWfjE,The actresses r not bad gr8 actually the plot seems kinda iffy or maybe that the trailer is kinda messed up a bit hey anything is fine but only if the movie doesn’t shove the fact that they r smart strong women up my throat its like tom cruise saying i can DO stunts....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks AWESOME. 

Literally the only downside to this is that the theme song isn't by Destiny's Child. 😢

Cant wait to see in theaters!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,just here for lana but they didnt even show lanas verse
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's not it, sorry."
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:36 hey baaee 😂😅🤣🤣🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Casting is poor ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is bosley a woman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disappointing I don't like how Kristin act she doesn't know how to do action did you see her how she hit the first guy I hope she never act again I don't like this remake I'm sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks better then before
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came for the alt-right incels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No one wants a stupid feminist movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna tank. Hard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Crap, all of it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Basically Charles Xaviers' mutant angels from his school. Nice!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aaaaaahhhhhhh i need this right now and i look forward to a time when i can watch it every single day. This looks freakin amazing!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Something z missing
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else is here after ari's sharing?
RSUq4VfWfjE,You guys realize this is a stand-alone sequel right? It’s not a reboot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kate McKinnon??? What??? 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stewart saying ""feisty"" is one of the greatest things xD"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Luis Gerardo Mendez 😍❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing can beat the original angel's  Drew, Lucy , Diaz are one hell of a badass trio . I didn't get that vibe from this trailer. But I'll watch it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,go take normal movies not 90 remake fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m in love
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s sad that I’m only here to hear the tree trio snippet.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They better have the Angels fighting pose!
RSUq4VfWfjE,full bullshit :D
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Someone needs to stop greenlighting terrible ideas just because it falls under the canopy of female empowerment or racially progressive.  While they're at it, stop with the reimaginings/remakes/ sequels  and come up with an orginal idea for once in your  effing greedy  lives."
RSUq4VfWfjE,As tres espiã de mais são vc?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks better than the drew barrymoore version.  Let’s hope it turns out to be so
RSUq4VfWfjE,More Wahmen movies.......no thank you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"the trailer is a bit messy imho
advertising the soundtrack is kinda ridiculous....
Naomi Scott is adorable though"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Luis Gerardo Méndez  ❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope 👎🏼
RSUq4VfWfjE,..and some more remakes...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WOW !!!!!!!
OMG !!!!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need the OG cast to make an apperance
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh.  Couldn't even make it all the way through.  Another remake for the sake of a remake.  Nothing interesting about it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thus trailer is revealing too much 🤔🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels: Without boobs edition 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone here for Matt LeBlanc?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here for Ariana and Naomi!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks! its Charlie's Angels by name ONLY
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Flat Angels 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I dont care about this movie at all, except Sir Patrick Stewart. Everything else is janky."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didn't even know they were making a remake of a remake.
RSUq4VfWfjE,John Chick
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie will fail.
RSUq4VfWfjE,im not suprised they made this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This could never compare to the charismatic cast of Cameron, Drew and Lucy. Srsly? The cast is laughable, to say the least."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Angels can’t difuse the bomb.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My my, kristen is stunning!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,They're supposed to be private investigators not cartoon super spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I always wanted a new song  of  miliey   and  Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just here for Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony is great at games,  and terrible at movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Show is as fake as the stars' autotuned voices.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like all kinds of terrible. Elizabeth Banks should stick to acting out scripts instead of writing them 😉
RSUq4VfWfjE,Copy of hitman
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana's voice where? 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Uhm... why do I like this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,imo this movie looks like a generic spy action film.
RSUq4VfWfjE,where is lanas part
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Aladdin to save princess jasmine 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:55  wasn't this in Kingsman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,What noah and Luis Gerardo
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am so old
RSUq4VfWfjE,They really are pushing a gender war.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So where's the Asian sidekick?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I only care about Ariana grande
RSUq4VfWfjE,SJW Propaganda
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes 👎 No.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like the concept, but its looks like more a movie to launch singles of Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, so i dont know."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I definitely need more Lana and less Ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The original three will always be the best Angels, sorry guys 🤷🏻‍♀️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is here because of lana del rey??
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAH CENTINEO CINEMATIC UNIVERSE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Motherfucking Patrick Stewart or better known for his role as Charles Xavier and the Poop emoji from the oscar winning movie The Emoji Movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well I think it looks cool. Regardless of whether it flops at the box office or not. I just dont get why Noah centino is here. He can't act.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"That was..... terrrrrrible. Why not just make it a random female spy movie? Why did you have to slap ""Charlie's Angels"" on it? Didn't get the Charlie's Angels vibe at all."
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,idk
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only guy who thinks the prettiest of them all seems to be Elizabeth Banks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Old is Gold!!!
Never can be replace the old version."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like the idea of the movie but i can tell already it's gonna suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,"To be honest, Ella Ballinska is looking way hotter than Kirsten and Naomi."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m intrigued...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh yeah we DEFINITLY need a remake of a movie that was already a remake of a movie that was a remake of a tv show from the 1970’s that no one under 30 even remembers. Take heed movie studios. Isnt it obvious that we the majority of the population (anyone with a brain and common sense) ARE DONE with your cringey overly FORCED feminazi sjw rhetoric. You keep trying and these movies keep bombing! (Ghostbusters anyone?) You turned Bosley into a woman because why? What was wrong with a faceless man who did no physical work from behind a chair? See the point that women are strong was ALREADY made back in the 1970’s. They didnt need Bosley (the man) the women did ALL the hard work! Empowering young women everywhere! Same with the movie remake! But not anymore right? Now you have to eradicate any competant male in any role and we have become jokes to you. The punchline falls flat Hollywood. I bet the man smacking the mints out of her hand is gay and thats the only reason that you deem it ok. Whereas you condone and think its funny to imply the straight man she knocked out might not wake up and may DIE and somehow its ok and funny to you. We are done Hollywood. Not just me, look around. At least 90% of this country is DONE with your Bullshit. What happened to girl power without making men look like complete morons and assholes?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally! We get to see Patrick Stewart play the live action version of his Character from American Dad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here for Patrick Stewart!
RSUq4VfWfjE,im pretty sure Miley is Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks great! Excited for this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks really, really terrible."
RSUq4VfWfjE,You got me at Lana del Rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey, it looks nice. Kristen looks cool. perhaps Imma gonna watch this"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's going to suck hard
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss u camron dias
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies the move
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lesbian heroes, black men friend and white men enemy 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Whoa whoa whoa ~ *insert Noah's style

The Angels (≧◡≦) ♡♡♡"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You guys can complain all you want, I'm just glad there's an action film coming that looks like fun that isn't another goddamn superhero flick."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I've never seen Charlies angles. SO It is like Totally spies, but for adults."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like for Naomi Scott ❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,hollywood has no original ideas anymore.   This looks like a stinking pile of hot garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a dud. Naomi Scott just can't catch a break
RSUq4VfWfjE,ew why is Noah scentenio in this......desgustang!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Naomi♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bombs.
RSUq4VfWfjE,No no NO
RSUq4VfWfjE,K Stewart is still rank
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is there so many remakes?!?!?! Hollywood you guys are getting boring...like bad an its sad!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why did they cast a 15 year old as the love interest? Please don’t make Noah Centino the “it” boy
RSUq4VfWfjE,No seas mamón weeey! Quien entendió ponga like
RSUq4VfWfjE,Girl kingsman 👍🏼👉🏻👎🏼💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Pumped up for this ! Its been years since cameron diaz , drew barrymore and lucy liu's women action flick.

But as of now holly is diverse and i can see white , brown and black womwn kicking butts and shooting stuffs"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Music in trailer is trash. felt like more of a promo for the song.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"A Ariana grande, Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey song ? this is a dream👼"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Shoulda made a Charlie’s angels 3 instead 😑😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks AWFUL
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm surprised Charlie is not played by a black man or a woman but it could be a homosexual I mean you can't have a straight white man in 2019 or 2020 mean that's just having the devil himself
RSUq4VfWfjE,So when is the song coming out?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"who is here after Arianas post, can't wait for the song"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Bosley is a female now ???? I'm sick of it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another addition to the NCU (Noah Centineo Universe)
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHO ELSE JUST HEAR FOR MILEY ARI AND LANA
RSUq4VfWfjE,naomi scott = jinx maze
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh. I'll just say that it's still better than batwoman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,try all you like but you will never be like the original Charlie's Angels not even close
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Please don’t suck
RSUq4VfWfjE,So when I first heard that Kristen was in this I was like she probably will the most out of place but by the end of this trailer I am sold! She was my favorite part!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Any arianators here?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie looks like Trash. This is Captain Marvel Level of Wokeness.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This doesn’t look that interesting at all. Why another remake??????? 👎🏾🥺
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry no. These girls weigh like 110 pounds shooting weapons that could easily knock them on their asses. Filmmakers are making me do to much of the imagining on this one. At least Atomic Blonde, she was believable (to an extent)."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Dear Sony,  
I would like to see this movie...it looks fun. If you can keep these 4 girls (i have never heard of them) from playing ""politician""  or ""political activist"" and keep them sticking to acting, I would appreciate it.
Dale"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this film to be made?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Ariana Grande
RSUq4VfWfjE,So most of the comments seem to like the trailer ........ MUSIC
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to tank so bad...hehehehe
RSUq4VfWfjE,hey that's princess jasmine doing an action scene without aladdin and the magic carpet
RSUq4VfWfjE,amazing.. is everything going to be  reboot now ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,So glad to see Pink Rangers and Rita Repulsa get along
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope one of the original angels makes a cameo appearance
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well atleast its not another one of those cases where they turn male driven properties into females.
That being said, this doesnt interest me one bit."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Reminds me of Oceans 8
RSUq4VfWfjE,BONNIE MCKEE WHAT?
RSUq4VfWfjE,no thanks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Chris Evans  / Chris Hemsworth / Chris Pratt / Chris Pine as Charlines Devils.
MAKE IT HAPPEN HOLLYWOOD!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charly isn't supposed to show up in person.
RSUq4VfWfjE,IMDB has 3 actors named Bosley...
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:57
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lol this a horrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,"2:08 ""R u flirting with a handsome nerd""... handsome is a stretch y'all..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,What?? Only 1 second of Lana Del Rey???? You bastards
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew, Cameron and Lucy 4ever"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Min 1:44... the ICONIC costumes from the first Charlie's Angels movie!!! I just dropped dead!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waack
RSUq4VfWfjE,Non
RSUq4VfWfjE,Surprised they didn’t replace Charlie with a woman.
RSUq4VfWfjE,İstanbul'u arayanlar 01:29'da
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm just happy they didn't gender swap the characters in this reboot. Looks like a solid popcorn flick. The director is relatively unproven, but maybe this can put her over the top. I'm not sold, but intrigued, for sure."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m gay
RSUq4VfWfjE,"From a business perspective, this movie is geared toward females and beta males. It should rake in plenty of money at the box office. Also, the embedded marketing of fashionable clothes, cosmetics and other related products will do well for retail stores."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks more like pitch perfect's angels...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centino : *_Same face expression everywhere_*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is ariana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it just me or did Kristen Stewart become a better actress once she finally came out ? No joke I'm actually impressed and excited to check this out 😅 Lookin badass ladies
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the result from SJW and me too movement...crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where’s the Genie when you need him?
RSUq4VfWfjE,There is Chava from Club de Cuervos 😀😀
RSUq4VfWfjE,"can’t wait to watch this, came here for ari. ☁️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks like .. dare I say, a tv show"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart as Kristen Stewart and Elizabeth Banks as a director. Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like another shitty movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It doesnt look bad, I kinda like how it feels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did not remember a black angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just heard ""Don't call me Ángel"" comming from miley's mouth and I alredy like the music  ❤🎶"
RSUq4VfWfjE,PC terror.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The best thing was PROFESSOR X walking!
RSUq4VfWfjE,If you're going to do it do it right. What's this! don't like it. They f'd it up. Don't mess with perfection.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood is fucking themselves up once again i see
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gringolandia..... Lo mismo de siempre.... Inventen algo nuevo😑😑😑😑😑😑
RSUq4VfWfjE,This show was overrated since it first came out and now you’ve decided to try it again jeez tell the Man behind this to step down y’all paying him tooo much for this trash🚮
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is not the closet?
Wowww!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"i’m so proud how Naomi went from 
nobody
lemonade mouth
power rangers
Aladdin
to this famous shiz"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sooo.....who is gay?💥
RSUq4VfWfjE,100 to 1 odds this is absolutely terrible. Sub 20%o on Rotten Tomatoes is my guess.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow... it looks fun.... 👍👍👍and the song..it's lit 🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:54 ""No mames Hugo Sanchez!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,AHHHH ARIIIII
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bella, Jasmine, & Miri in the same film, but I was finally on board when I saw dancing in the trailer. 😉"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Professor X finally has a solo film.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it an adaptation of Totally Spies ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tbh I just want the song Ariana, Miley and Lana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,was expecting the male version
RSUq4VfWfjE,Songs ??????
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart smiling?! I never thought I would see that.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:52 did he just imply that mint was a bomb and proceeded to slap the said bomb on to the ground?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone fell in love with Naomi Scott all over again? Coz i do 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awaiting....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh Please NO!!! and to top it off they added kristen stewart who can't act and looks like a man! may as well have added miley, beyonce and ariana to the mix and even a kardashian!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ive seen all of this hate comment before , its always like this in almost every movie trailer. Hate this hate that trash movie bla bla bla but after 3 days movie played on cinema people be like ""uuu i love the movie awesome bla bla bla"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noahhhh😍😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart better be gay in this because i cant handle her being heterosexual with that haircut
RSUq4VfWfjE,Except Naomi’s acting in Aladdin was meh and Kristen can’t act AT ALL.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope this movie is in IMAX
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cute...

Who's offended?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie’s Angels were all straight women, not a lesbian.  Keep forcing this crap down everyone’s throats!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,That Noah centimo kid I just don’t get it he’s cute but nothing special average actor I don’t see the appeal he’s this generations chad Michael Murray
RSUq4VfWfjE,when they feature ari’s and mileys vocals but not lanas😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is ari
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks... *AMAZING*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I ain't mad at it
RSUq4VfWfjE,1000% trash I mean the trash man won't even pick this up.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I was excited to see Patrick Stewart, far less excited for everyone else in the movie. Ergo... Red box... Maybe. Probably not."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only thing though is I wish they kept the classic Charlie’s Angels theme, and maybe put a modern spin on it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Would watch just because I’m hoping for a lesbo scene by Kristen :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart smiling is always a yes. I am one of those expecting cameo, plis Sony make it happen."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay Kristen lookin a 10/10 hottie while choking a man out. Loving it :p
RSUq4VfWfjE,another wrecked reboot after MIB
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yayaayayayayaayay I’ve waited so long for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This movie reminds me of what happens in the last episode of BARRY, with his girlfriend!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok Kristen looks hot af
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks okay-ish. Naomi Scott looks cute as always. Got a hot new single by the queens of pop. And then there's Kristen Stewart. So yeah I think I'm gonna watch it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They finally learned you can have an all female lead cast without being sanctimonious about it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why Kristen looks so ugly!!!😩😩 She should let her hair grow and be pretty again👌🏼☺️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not at all sexy... Charlie's angel refers to the sexiness and old one have that but not in this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg i dont like it as much. I still prefer the old angels :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Am I the only one but Naomi doesn't sound like herself in this, she sounded different on Lemonade Mouth."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this feels like Kingsman :The Secret Service ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks amazeballs!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Goixtei
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nah I'm not on board with this. The trio of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu had perfect sex appeal and synergy. Drew Barrymore alone was way more beautiful than all the 3 new ones combined. 
This feels like another stupid feminist agenda driven crap."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,There is someone out there that actually wants to see this? Who knew?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm only interest in the soundtrack of this movie.hopefully the Soundtrack will release early.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think that’s the most expressive I’ve ever seen Kristen stewart be
RSUq4VfWfjE,Release the song!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Culture has gone into the ""repeat, rinse"" cycle.
RIP America."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like the same comedy movies they keep making nowadays 🤷🏽‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,La canción será un HIT
RSUq4VfWfjE,This has SUPER Flop written all over it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana del rey ??? 😡😡😡😡
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's Lana?!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worest trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Holy wow, Ella Balinska makes the others look like dwarves, what a goddess."

RSUq4VfWfjE,This is part of the gay agenda to convert all straight women 🤷🏽‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"THIS IS NOT A REMAKE!!! This is a continuation of our original 1970’s and 2000’s angels. Charles Townsend has expanded his agencies instead of having ONE Los Angeles location, he is now a billionaire and has multiple agencies with different sets of Angels globally! I am hoping we get cameos from our original 1970’s angels as well as our 2000’s angels. I’m so excited for the legacy of the Charles Townsend agency, and you should be to! ❤️♥️❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm gonna judge this movie by its cover. No sex appeal at all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,👏TONE👏DEAF👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart playing the real life Avery Bullock in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old angels had more actions..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I might finally like kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Vengo de Ari ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg 🔥❤️❤️ finally the cast is so sickkk 💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana del rey 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aaaaaaaaaaand i am going to be seeing this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t get it... every movie that has only male main characters talk about respecting women and them being strong and always better than man.
But movies with main female characters do the opposite...I mean if the bad guy or some random guy is sexist then go ahead make those stereotypes, but I got the feeling this movie will be all offending men jokes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,woke garbage or not?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y'all don't seem to get or understand what happens when you get woke. You go broke. This movie is going to flop at the box office and it's all because yall want to push your narrative.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Angels are supposed to be hot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Chava !  1:54
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Honestly, Hollywood needed this reboot. This was one of the best series to come to television, even though unfortunately the 2000 and 2003 movie weren't that great in the box office. I have no doubt that with Elizabeth Banks at the helm, and these three killer stars, it's going to be a fantastic movie bring a great tribute to TV's greatest spy queens."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks really stupid. CHARLIE'S ANGELS is supposed to take place in the 1970s, first of all. By modernizing it, you completely take away everything that made it so special. This movie is going to suck. What a waste."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, this looks awful."
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Lana's stans left the chat*
RSUq4VfWfjE,So only bones no chicken.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1st thought: This will be great for teenage girls.

2nd thought: Is that Centineo?! Oh noooooooo! 😖

1st thought confirmed."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks badass and i'm glad this is a continuation on the entire franchise and not a straight up reboot, i hope the Angels from the early 2000s films make a cameo, considering that this one has Angels all across the globe PLEASE!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cringed so hard watching this concoction my testicles got new wrinkles...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Whew, that's straight fire! ❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Arianators, where y’all at?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I liked the original show. I liked the 2 previous movies. I like Elizabeth Banks. 
The trailer did not get me psyched at all.
I'll wait until it comes to HBO, SHOWTIME, CINEMAX,  etc.
Or I may just skip it all together. 
Plus I never really cared for Ole Slackjaw Stewart.
Kristin, not Patrick that is."
RSUq4VfWfjE,😂😂 looks like more rubbish. Be a fiver on the sale shelf before you know it.😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Thanks guys!!❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bruh...... What the hell?
This makes me like the old cast a lot more.
But, I'll give it a shot."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't have Charlie's Angels without a classic Jeep trio scene :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's gonna bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,but where’s ariana grande?
RSUq4VfWfjE,When is this 🔥song dropping
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart in sexy straight dance is the end of the word.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Seeing women beating up men is just silly.
RSUq4VfWfjE,where is sam claflin tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music is baaad though.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Arriba Luis Gerardo Méndez
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks extremely, extremely bad."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I used to think the old ones were bad, now I can appreciate them better..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,IM FUCKING DYING KILL ME RIGHT NOW BECKY WTFFF THIS IS ENDING MY LIFEEEE I CANT TAKE ITTTTTT
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why? 
There is no match for old angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,FINALLY! Something worth watchinG!
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Kirsten Stewart made new Charlie's Angels already jeez can't wait see and then how was it so Bosley is a woman😮
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is that Ariana singing?
The hell no!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Reboot year
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow, can't believe SJW Hollywood made an all-female remake of Charlie's Angel. I hate feminism."
RSUq4VfWfjE,LEGIT AWESOME! LADIES RULING IT ALL!!💖💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought 3 women. How come 2 women and a little boy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Anyone here just because of Ariana Grande
👇like if U R😄😄"
RSUq4VfWfjE,GET SOME ACTION! SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT I HAVE JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE SUBSCRIBED!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 😍😘😩❤💍
RSUq4VfWfjE,So fucking excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLIE´S LESBIANS....   comming soon   :v :v :v
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is the beautiful voice of Lana Del Rey in music??
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah feminist james bond or something like this. Nothing original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Jasmine are ready to kick the bad guy asses
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Producer:How many women you need?
Director:yes...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"They got Kristen , the girl with no facial expressions, to look alive? Wow."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I disliked it for the trailer introduction... That trend needs to end yesterday. I don't need to be told that I'm about to watch a trailer that I clicked on knowing what it's going to be.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott....... come to butt-head.😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This actually looks promising!
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTEN STEWART i miss BELLA 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,this gonna be perfect Ariana Grande song that girl of aladin and noah omg 😩😩😩😩🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"oh joy, another ""Woke"" movie.. Hollywood is trying real hard to push their agenda."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not woke enough, it should have been angels in drag and in disabled bodies, now that's a movie everybody would enjoy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande sent me here..and im glad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,My fear is that they might have fucked themselves by making it a movie. It feels like it would more sense to make it a tv show or a Netflix Original Series. I feel like it would make it waaaaaaay more understanding and you could elaborate more on the story without rushing anything.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally Spies parody
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aren't Charlie's angels supposed to be hot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bitches are badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no
RSUq4VfWfjE,'Sex and the city' spy version.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think they should stop rebooting old movies. Do something original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey sony pictrues entertainment is Charlies Angels gonna be pg 13 or r
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:26 worst punching I have ever seen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is the song saying ""do t call me angel""? They wouldnt be that dumb would they?

And oh course there is a dress up scene."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I will only watch this movie cauz of Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does every movie have to have a wannabe girl guy with short hair?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing exciting about a reboot of a reboot. The previous one at least looked entertaining.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Someone here for Ari, Miley n Lana?♡"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garrett Watts must me quaking.
RSUq4VfWfjE,How this garbage has 23k likes?
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:30 Professor X found a new job
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am so excited for this!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,WOW 🤟😜
RSUq4VfWfjE,"What a stupid movie,Bosley is a woman. Seems Hollywood ran out of ideas so let's remake old stuff the last 10 years is all 70s remakes of TV shows that couldn't get to the movies sad but look at the no talent people in Hollywood that's why there is no new ideas  pedophiles an deviants"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"People: why is Patrick Stewart not credited
Woke gang: we're not gonna let a man take credit for a woman's work"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart I miss you....

RSUq4VfWfjE,LANA

RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here for Lana and Lana only
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another awful Sony movie.

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yawn. Been there, done that. And Cameron, Lucy and Drew did it best."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gorgeous, Tough, badass Kristen Stewart"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So bosley is a woman now ?? Mmmm... 🤔 i miss the soundtrack everytime their about to do the iconic pose together, Giving it a chance .. Might exceed my expectations👍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like the old Charlie's S movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:37 Armpit Scene..... Weaponize :P
RSUq4VfWfjE,i threw up at 1:38 this movie is not clean at all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So even the Bosley character has to be female. 2019 Hollywood: Men=bad, women=good. I'll pass on this. I'd rather watch any of the John Wick movies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and the rest of the angels look 😍😍😍😍 I’m excited to watch this!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Disgusting!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is bulshit i would prefer the old Charles angle's 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is the voice of Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Another Charlies Angels 
Hollywood runnin out of ideas."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"annoying, horrible, shitty music choice, otherwise not that bad"

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Finally she is back, love you kristen....❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope it has cameo of the original casts of 2000 Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only thing I hated was Noah Central
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a Netflix original production lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*Edited*

This 70s kid immediately started screaming: *I need my Farrah bangs!* 

I get that for a lot of young people, their points of reference are the movies with Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore.  
However, the OG Angels will forever be Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, and Kate Jackson.
Props to the Props department for the omage to Kate with the short, bowl cut wig. ♡"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This doesn't look like it's bringing anything exciting and new to the table. I miss Kate Jackson.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This better not another wokemovie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,2.26
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't hear lana del rey :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,So Bella gave up her powers for this😞😞
RSUq4VfWfjE,Are those three women really the best they could do?
RSUq4VfWfjE,chills!!!!

RSUq4VfWfjE,Noami Scott: OH MINTS..... Hold my Lamp
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is jasmine after being a sultan
RSUq4VfWfjE,when is the soundtrack coming???
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier is charlie? :P
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm totally here for this, and more for the soundtrack 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another fail movie from Sony
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If Drew, Lucy or Cameron don’t make a cameo then I’m suing"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait so Elizabeth banks and patrick stewart are both named Bosley? This is more confusing than Mcavoy and Stewart as Xavier 🤯
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why no Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,what is bella doing there
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so fucking here for this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"None of them r beautiful,  i miss Drew and Cameron"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All right, I'll admit it. This actually does look really fun. It's also kind of nice to see Kristen Stewart in a mainstream movie again (but I still do really enjoy her more indie films)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"🎶na,na,na,Na...there’s no...Lucy Liu!🎶
WTF!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not Noah Centipede
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not Noah Centipede

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nobody:....
Elizabeth Banks: Here you have Cringe's Angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yikes
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song from Ari is so cool 😍❤

RSUq4VfWfjE,In Elizabeth Banks we trust
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gay Mary Sue 💩
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana, Miley and Lana the real life angels <3"
RSUq4VfWfjE,you might just be the next flop in the making!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charlie's SJWs, gonna flop so hard."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Patrick Stewart is the best thing about this trailer... but to be fair , Patrick Stewart is the best thing in anything involving Patrick Stewart so..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart
Teresa Palmer"
RSUq4VfWfjE,And Lana del Rey? 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow showing the last scene of the movie in the trailer again... these companies never learn
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well this looks like more shite. Hey Hollywood thanks for more pointless crap the rich movie stars waste cash on whilst they talk about equality. Why don't you give all your cash to those poor people you want to make equal instead of blowing it on this. It's almost like it's a trend to talk about equality whilst they just have an opposing lifestyle, the hypocrites."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks unbelievably hot in this omg
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen, Naomi and Ella are arguably the prettiest angels of all time."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Smells rotten
RSUq4VfWfjE,No classis charlie's Angels theme?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Question, tell me what you think about me. I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Subtilly sponsored by Audi
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another feminism agenda....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana Del Rey has an angel’s voice
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The old one was much better ... Diaz,Liu and Barrymore ... More convincing as agents..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rita Repulsa finally recruited Kimberly... :0
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Pathetic and so gay , yuckhhh ,

Kristin Stewart wasted it ,

Freaking feminism."
RSUq4VfWfjE,No sex appeal. No humour. WOOOOOOOOW
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohhhhhhhh…. I want to die...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"To me, this is not Charlie's angel.
It looks like another modern action film."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This gonna be super hit movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,That looks bomb AF 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female director woohoooo
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks bad... Those jokes 🤦
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen,Ariana..!!!❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love this Chaile's Angles reboot trailer!
RSUq4VfWfjE,that black girl is hot af
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Casts were perfect, but the movies presentation kinda feels like meeeeeeehhhhh 😣"
RSUq4VfWfjE,ARIANA QUEEEEEEEN
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley a woman...I'm gonna take a guess and the bad guys will be white males, straight and ooooze toxic masculinity...pass, it was not made for me and the director probably isn't interested in what works for me. No thank you verrrrrry much"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"No one: 
Me: Don’t call me angel. 😌✨"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hollywood finally gave Kristen her soul back. Damn she's glowing
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idk how to feel about it I think the second trailer should help
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Love it!! Kristen Stewart is so freakin hot and Noah, noah, noah why you are so cute 🔥💕😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who's hottest girl among them?, ;)




  Im confused!!! 🤔😋😋"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So woke
RSUq4VfWfjE,gonna be flop. first one was way better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I remember walking out of the first Charlie's Angels after 10 minutes. This one won't even get that lucky.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf is this!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only wondering who is CHARLIE ?🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ummm no one asked for this.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everything was going swell until Noah f*ckin Centineo!
RSUq4VfWfjE,How'd they make a story that already had female leads feel like it's a gender swap reboot?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess protection program tingz🤪😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Pukes*
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Don't judge a movie by its trailer."" you mean..."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I smell cliches but I'm fan of more women of color
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was so skeptic about this when I first heard about it but damn this actually makes me hyped af!!! I absolutely love Kristen and Naomi and it looks like Ella is a total badass!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought this was gonna really suck but looks way better then the last two and I'm not even a Kristen Stewart fan lol but proud of Naomi Scott she's come a long way
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like a cool cast... that has been wasted on another fucking reboot.... just stop and give us transformers 20 instead. Is hollywood just too busy focusing on trump that they can't do anything new anymore?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like its going to bomb at the box office. Not hating it but just giving speculation
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Drew Barrymore also produced it, I’m"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo can only be a boyfriend?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love the OG but this one looks more realistic and a bit lighter on the comedy... I'm for it!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Queen mother Lana del Rey OMG I stan
RSUq4VfWfjE,Finally
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thanks.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who came from Ariana grande ✨
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo 😱😱😱
RSUq4VfWfjE,PLEASE ADD SOME CAMEO SCENES  FOR THE OLD ANGELS... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
RSUq4VfWfjE,i’m so ready for this movie🍿
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lesbians
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ha Gaaaaaayyyyyyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If no one is going to say it then I will
This trailer is so woke 😂
The movie will fail at the Box Office"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Joseph Gordon Levitt must be really unemployed these days
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ghostbusters 2016 who?
RSUq4VfWfjE,They r not angels they r devils
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is going to be trash and bomb at the box office.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who’s here from Ariana’s YouTube channel? 💗
RSUq4VfWfjE,So is this gonna be the 2016 Ghostbusters to Kingsman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love how gay this all is. Queer energy all over it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The new one is great, and I miss the old one so bad. I wish at least the previous angels would show up for a minute in this new series"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks like Charlie's Witch!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just wish that noah has more screen time in the movie than he had in this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why is noah cantineo literally everywhere?????
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks fun.
RSUq4VfWfjE,They teased that song too much for it to just be Ariana’s basic oversinging “Angelelelelsssssss”
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t take Kristen seriously. She is so out of place in this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I LOVE it! The wardrobe scene!!! I want to watch it right now!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is not standing in the centre. That's quite a demotion.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana Grande,Miley Cyrus and Lana del rey fans do like this
👇🏻"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a whole lot of bad acting
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Simply can not compare with Lucy, Drew and Cameron, they were true angels."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg who casted Kristen Stewart as angel hahahahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg Luis Gerardo Méndez 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,You know what I'm not doing another ghost busters 2016 I'm staying away from this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait for the cringey feminist lines
RSUq4VfWfjE,Saw Elizabeth speak about the making of this movie and she's SO SO SO PASSIONATE about every bit of it 😭 I'm so excited to watch
RSUq4VfWfjE,It is a pity that the agenda should work (Bosley)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Enough with the remakes of remakes.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart look soo hot 🔥💃💃💃
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another pointless IP reboot that no one wanted.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen: ""I think women can do anything""
Random Guy: ""Just because they can doesn't mean they should.""
Kristen: 
Uh Oh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Niiiice! And then there’s Noah Centineo! Even cooler!
RSUq4VfWfjE,ALSO  GIMMIE DAT SINGLE ARI
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande 😉💞
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOVE IT!!

RSUq4VfWfjE,*Yawns* Nexxxxt! Lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I really loved this trailer. Can't wait for this movie. But who called them angels? Are these Charlie's angels.? Damn, Charlie did you lose your sense. They are only spies, previous Charlie's angels were real angels. I felt so.. 😔😳😢"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is here bcs of Ariana Grande? :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah look at us we’re WAMEN!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for Lana & Noah.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This will flop so hard
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Looks ok, will bomb at box office."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Slay ari😗😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've definitely found some similarity with the movie call the Barbie spy squad...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do we have another remake of this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The cringe level is high with this one 🐒
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen has given so many expressions, she hasn't given in entire Twilight series"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Si, solo vengo a escuchar el ""Angel"" de Ariana."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another reboot that doesn’t need to happen. Where has Hollywood’s originality gone. Sick of seeing movies re made
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im not mad at it but who is asking for a charlies angels remake remake lol like how many times are we gonna keep doing reboots for the modern generation so every 2 decades just rehash some old franchise im getting burnt out on these movies and im only 28
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Forget the past, Enjoy The Present"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Comment section looks excited for the movie, people I've talked to like it too, me personally I'm indifferent but I think it looks better than the earlier ones but the like to dislike ratio made me think I was watching a trailer for a star wars movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone here from ariana grande?
RSUq4VfWfjE,boring!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,What the hell is doing Gerardo Mendez  there lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love you Kristen😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'll watch it for the eye candy....
RSUq4VfWfjE,I come from the future... this BOMBS hard at the box office.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I want one where the Angels are played by Lana, Miley and Ariana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,epic fail haha
RSUq4VfWfjE,Awesome sauce. But who is Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oxi,quase não ouvi a Lana,CADÊ A LANA ??????"
RSUq4VfWfjE,And Patrick Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,W H A T    A    I N S I P I D    C A S T .
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Que mona va esta chica siempre Naomi Scott <3






....es lo mas feliz q he visto a Kristen en una pelicula"
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT !!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier and the angels...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen’s gay energy in this trailer is giving me LIFE!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlize's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,If they don’t have Independent women on the soundtrack what was the point
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m intrigued...feeling hopefully and can’t wait to see it in November!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love every person in this cast and Ariana, Miley, Lana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So Elizabeth Banks, Patrick Stewards, and Djimon Hounsou are bosleys? I bet at least one of them is the main villain."
RSUq4VfWfjE,dude this looks amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,"K Stew smiling people!
she`s S-M-I-L-I-N-G"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A reboot nobody asked for... Hollywood's originality is zero!
RSUq4VfWfjE,KS is back..
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is going to fail...
RSUq4VfWfjE,now this looks more interesting then the other 2 movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y lana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,seriously? they use justin beiber as a charlie angels?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old angels cameo pls :(((
RSUq4VfWfjE,To the Casting Director : You had one job !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like Sony is forcing their employees to comment on the trailer. They may also be removing negative comments and thumbs down because there is no way this piece of trash has nothing but positive comments.
RSUq4VfWfjE,NO Lana Del Rey singing in the trailer? The misogyny
RSUq4VfWfjE,The reboot no one asked for😏
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen seems so into the role i love it!!! and naomi scott is gorgeous ugh i have to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott: rock star, power ranger, princess and now an Angel."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought this movie was about Charles Manson . Turns out it's just another stupid action movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wasn’t this movie releases a long time ago?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is Bill Murray??
RSUq4VfWfjE,yaasssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
RSUq4VfWfjE,"it would have been wayyy more better if the girls from the soundtrack would be the actual angels , cuz they are boooring KRISTEN? REALLY?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The only question in my mind: But why?
WHY?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Doesn't look bad but I fear there's an unnecessary ultra feminist undertone coming
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait for it I wish it was already out
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really glad they changed the Chinese character into a Black person because diversity is about skin color not serving underrepresented people. When you put an Indian or Asian or Latino and try to pass that off as a true minority when their skin isnt even black what would the point be?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lady super hero movies?? Mehhhh... Its gonna suck.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think they should rename this Charlie's Demons.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else here thinks this is just gonna be another hyped but flop remake of an iconic franchise?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Me: *still contemplating if I'm gonna watch the movie*
Learned Noah Centineo will be in the movie
Me: I'm excited to watch this movie 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,There was a time when they used to be sexy but now they all look like a flat chested teen boy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks cheap! Which is probably for the best.....
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana Del Rey voice I can't hear
RSUq4VfWfjE,"this Font look like from ""Terminator"" movie or I`am wrong"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bossly is a GIRL?!? 😧
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg!!! ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Was that Man like Vuj In the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was waiting for the part of Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Has a very Totally Spies feel to it. I love it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Easily one of the most confusing movie trailers I've ever seen.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss before cast Cameron, drew, Lucy 😢"
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks much better than the last attempt. thumbs up
RSUq4VfWfjE,"it's about time this sexist film was changed for male leads ffs, enough of this crap it's 2019 ffs. Love how they even changed Bosley."
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow this looks horrid

RSUq4VfWfjE,I love how much fun it looks like these girls are having in this movie. Gonna watch it for sure
RSUq4VfWfjE,The princess is now an angel 🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am i the only one who thinks this is going to be like the Totally Spice cartoon
RSUq4VfWfjE,It’s a no from me. There’s no muscles in their arms from training smh
RSUq4VfWfjE,women
RSUq4VfWfjE,What no Charlie’s Angels original theme song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"looks like a way more self serious, less fun version of the early 2000 films"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana voice is so heavenly
RSUq4VfWfjE,She looks reborn.i have high hopes for her
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is this going to be worse than Ghostbusters?
RSUq4VfWfjE,trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"And I only see: Sharon Stone, Angelina Jolie, and Sandra Bullock"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Disappointed to see that actresses portraying strong characters still have to wear revealing dresses, show cleavage, bare legs, hips, navel,camera focussed on  buttock and do sex like scenes."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Totally spies live action anybody and who is Charlie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is so hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,oMg but can we talk about janelle monae song?
RSUq4VfWfjE,best part is kristen stewart 😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Holy crap Kristen Stewart can actual smile!?!

RSUq4VfWfjE,Oooooo Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,CUANDO SALE LA CANCION?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks bakes the cake and eats it too
RSUq4VfWfjE,This was not that bad 😌👍 I’m down to see it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You gotta be kidding, Kristen Stewart???. I thought Charlie's Angels should have some sort of charisma to charm the bad guys. What this girl's gonna do?, bore them to death with her dull, expressionless face?. Nice CGI in this trailer though, they made her smile!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Solo quiero escuchar la canción !!! No me importa la película !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,0.30 He can walk? Which Universe is this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass !
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ah yes the new x men and theres prof x and a vampire's wife plus aladdin's wife
RSUq4VfWfjE,Plz release zombie land 2 trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande Dont call me angel 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,You can see the costumes from the other Charlie’s Angels movies at 1:44
RSUq4VfWfjE,Tonight I am going to watch foursome sex videos. Just got the inspiration.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Secretly hoping Cameron, Drew, and Lucy make a surprise cameo."
RSUq4VfWfjE,no...…...…
RSUq4VfWfjE,How many more are they gonna make gosh😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why would you smack a potential explosive down out of someones hand and two I don't see any acting going on here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Does no one care about my BOI Patrick Stewart?
RSUq4VfWfjE,5 more months omfg WHYYYY
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I thought Holywood was into gender swapped remakes. WHERE IS MY TOM HIDDLESTON, TOM HOLLAND AND TOM HARDY ANGELS"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miley cyrus 🔥👑
RSUq4VfWfjE,🚮🚮🚮
RSUq4VfWfjE,🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🤾‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,And que the SJW accusations after that first statement in the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah is everywhere
RSUq4VfWfjE,He is going to wake up unless he doesn't ....okay
RSUq4VfWfjE,"These girls won't hold a candle to Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am come for Lana Del Rey💫
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible. Also who edited this thing?! I could have done better on iMovie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh!!!! Tucker😍😍😍😍😍💋💋💋💋💋💋♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Any trailer that mentions who performs the music soundtrack means that the film is almost guaranteed to be a stinker.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm sorry but a female Bosley??? not interested they can keep this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,From Princess to Agent. 🤟❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Remakes of classics have been a bit disappointing in the recent times. Let's see what this movie offers.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I dont think y'all know but Kristen Stewart has been in movies since twighlight just not big blockbuster movies like Charlie's Angels.
Edit: someone in the comments informed me that she was also in ""Snow white and the huntsman"" which is another big budget blockbuster movie. If she was in any other big blockbuster movies after twighlight put it in the replies"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh my kristen 👌💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringegasm!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier's angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one who is tired of Hollywood making reboots and remakes that we never asked for and will just turn out uninterestingly cliche and boring? What happened when movies were original and not based on some kind of reference or comic book but based on an actual idea from someone and just make it into a movie? We’re getting very uncreative day by day
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is the first time I have seen Kristen cheerful & lively. And for that alone I'd like to watch it
RSUq4VfWfjE,I dont fucking care other ppl's comment. I'm gonna watch it since Kristen smile a lot and be silly in this one!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick Stewart is in this!!!?? I was not expecting that 😲👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,In hindi
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:29 View of the Golden Horn and Topkapi Palace ...... Just a few of the reasons why Istanbul has always been a chosen place for espionage movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ladies and gents this is the momment youve waitin for..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Is this Charlie is charlie sheehan 
Lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,♥️♥️♥️♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miss the old Crew .
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMG, no. This movie is going to suck. :( :( :("
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so excited for this movie!! And the song seems to be 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,It will bomb at the box office
RSUq4VfWfjE,Rubbish
RSUq4VfWfjE,thanks for using the aug...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe OG only
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want to BE Kristen Stewart !
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh Jasmine, her first wish was to become a spy :)) I should've thought of that."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Like Ariana Grande and Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's a cringey comment section.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boo ! Failed.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love kristen stewart in this already
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is miscast.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another reboot from Hollywood.... CREATIVELY BANKRUPT!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is lana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,how you manage to cram like 20 action scenes in one trailer and still make your movie look bland and boring?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks is gorgeous 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ahhh this looks awesome!!! And Elizabeth Banks is directing it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ella Balinska is beautiful
RSUq4VfWfjE,Unnecessary sequel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Too much of kristen in this trailer. Why not give equal importance to all???
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss Cameron, Drew and Lucy."
RSUq4VfWfjE,okey but when is the song released?
RSUq4VfWfjE,*FEMINIST : THE ACTION MOVIE*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I already know this movie will be cringe by Kristen Stewart alone.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It feels exactly like MIB: International and Ocean's 8, whatever that means."
RSUq4VfWfjE,HOLY TERMINATOR FONT
RSUq4VfWfjE,If Elizabeth Banks' fake feminism BS makes this movie flop I'm going to be pissed!
RSUq4VfWfjE,loveeeeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,What Tomboys wants to be sexy
RSUq4VfWfjE,This low key just became one of my most anticipated movies for the rest of 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,2000's charlie's angels is still better. im only here for the soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sony please make sure you release this movie in india
RSUq4VfWfjE,And the movie will move faster that it will appear smaller than the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,😍😍😍Kristen!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This gonna be a big flop for no reason. Please don't comment anyone............
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Patrick Stewart = Charlie ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The way the song lyrics keep saying ""angel"" is quite annoying. Do they need to keep reminding us what we're looking at?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,waiting for ya🤗
RSUq4VfWfjE,Crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nothing can replace Cameron Diaz 🖕🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Girl power baby..., 😘😳"
RSUq4VfWfjE,It looks terrible
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie REBOOT 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,they should come up with different title not charlie's angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yo im just excited that naomi is in the movie like damn and how kristen is not in another vampire movie and that ariana grande is singing a song based on this movie like you guys are on a role
RSUq4VfWfjE,JUST FUCKING STOPPPP!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There’re a lot of pretty big names on it (including the soundtrack) I hope it all will work out. Btw, after godzilla, toy’s story, child’s play, now charlie’s angels? What year is it again today?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,YT need to drop this crap. Crap. Crap. Sh*t...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ranger Pink
RSUq4VfWfjE,wtf is this garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,beside sir patrick stewart and kristen and disliked everybody in this film.🙂🙂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen 👏🏻 Stewart 👏🏻
RSUq4VfWfjE,Umm i'm not sure about this reboot:(
RSUq4VfWfjE,Illuminati Triangle Crap...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks more promising than MIB international.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I cannot express how excited I am for this! Can't wait to listen the whole song and my baby Lana ❤️❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for Naomi Scott
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen and Lana... 💦 oh dear lord ""don't call me angel """
RSUq4VfWfjE,This sucks
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh look the corporate liberal youtube manipulating dislike button throttling dislikes likely and adding fake likes to hide the ratio on this trash, definitely fake numbers and pretty sure comments are being deleted. Welcome to communism. LOL"
RSUq4VfWfjE,But Why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMFGGGGG I LOVED IT SO MUCH
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen looks amazing
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is so awful lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,PRECISO DISSO NA MINHA MESA AGORA
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why not remove the actress play with  kristen stewart Emma watson Jennifer Lawrance .
RSUq4VfWfjE,I got half way in...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It's official
Hollywood has run out of new ideas"
RSUq4VfWfjE,there has to be an Asian
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay, but concept: LANA, MILEY AND ARI AS THE ANGELS. THAT WOULDVE BEEN BOMB AS HELL!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I mean, i wish the angels are Jennifer Lawrence, Rihanna and Vanessa Hudgens, thats just me :D"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Surprised it's not 3 guys..
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Director: how many facial expressions are you going to make in this movie?
Kristen: NO."
RSUq4VfWfjE,HOW KIM POSSIBLE LIVE ACTION MOVIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is actually acting in this...like her face is moving and its believable I am actually willing to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Power Puff Girls on steroids!!!*
RSUq4VfWfjE,Absolutely I'll watch it. From Thailand🇹🇭
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG..!! KRISTEN STEWART...😍♥️😍♥️😍♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,SPEECHLESS
RSUq4VfWfjE,FOREVER AND ALWAYS GAY FOR KRISTEN STEWART
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana and Miley? AWESOME.  Lana? WHY??? Her depressing emo pop/goth/whatever music doesn't fit the sunny, breezy tone of this film. They should have used Cardi B or Nicki, Heck, even Azalea Banks would have been better than Lana."
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:27 lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Мулатка, лесбиянка, Боссли девушка, пиздят мужиков под саундтрек с женским вокалом. Идите нахуй со своим феминизмом"
RSUq4VfWfjE,PRINCESS JASMIN TURNS TO AN ANGEL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boy I can already smell the box office fail
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the full song ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMGH
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Sexy Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"*this are not Charles angles this are impotent Charles outstanding toxic feminist*

*Title should be*

*CHARLES  TOXIC* *FEMINIST* *-men's endgame*"

CAMERON. DREW. LUCY"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't wait the new single and great movie!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love all iterations of Charlie's Angels. I will totally check this out.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If this didn’t have Kristen, I wouldn’t be interested.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everything is nice except that shitty Ariana soundtrack.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh my goshhhh😍 I Can't wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It reminds me of the old trio: Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The difference in the advertising for this film and 2003 one is that, in 2003, the film was selling this idea as a silly tongue and cheek spy comedy with 3 sexy leads who will, at times, will be barely wearing anything."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Based on this trailer, they don't seem to have great chemistry together. All I can see is Mashup of Aladdin and Twilight Saga. 😂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So the pink ranger now works for rita repulsa. ""a whole new world"" ???"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lame
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Horrific, at best."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks cool. You can easily open a beer by the chin of painted blonde.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think Lana is only breathing in the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen legit looks like the woman android from Detroit become human in the first scene of the trailer. Idk if its just me or everyone sees it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"An angel cheated on Batman 😃 

I'm still Batman and I'm rich."
RSUq4VfWfjE,omg Ari♥

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why, why are they doing this again??? Man our thoughts are stuck on the same stuff"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"as a lesbian, (breathes heavily) kristen stewart,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,WTF!!! GTFO with  this...
RSUq4VfWfjE,All the fun it's gonne in this version...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yass.. My Green and pink ranger.. Millenial version.. 👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell Yeah 👏👏👏👏👏👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,Guy at 1:53 looks like David Vujanic LMFAOO
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's the new Single?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didn’t even bother watching the rest of the trailer. Garbage.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"no feminism sh*t, simple and nice trailer. kudos"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nami Scott from Pink Ranger to Princess Jasmine to this!!!

RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine left Aladdin 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here only for Miley ❤️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am waiting for the film because of Ella Balinska
RSUq4VfWfjE,Loved it
RSUq4VfWfjE,More SJW propaganda.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never show a fcking 'bumper' in front of a trailer... it's so fcking annoying and you get an instant dislike from me for that
RSUq4VfWfjE,where is the comedy?
RSUq4VfWfjE,The premiere could be at an Ariana Grande concert.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is Sir Stewart involved in this mess?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Personally, I'm flipping of excitement about this movie!, the scenes look awesome, the cast is great!, so freaking excited to see more of Naomi Scott!, and Kristen Stewart is looking great here as well, and to it's credit, its looking to be better than the 2000s movies (which I do genuinely enjoy), honestly I can't wait!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like it 💙
RSUq4VfWfjE,😭😭😭😪😪😥😥
RSUq4VfWfjE,"naomi be like from aladdin to charlie’s angels:

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Girls, you can have this movie. We have Mission: Impossible and Bourne."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Okay but this is gonna break records, the involvement of all the masterminds in this. And it’s only JUNE 😭😭 countdown begins now 😍"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a tv show
RSUq4VfWfjE,What an unremarkable and boring trailer  !!

RSUq4VfWfjE,KStew back in Bella Cullen mode! I love her fighting style.
RSUq4VfWfjE,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi 😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Was this a trailer for Charlie's Angels or CHEETAH GIRLS 4? - I cant tell a difference.

Doesn't feel like a action movie."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked the old Charlie's Angels movies
RSUq4VfWfjE,KRISTENN IS SO PRETTY
RSUq4VfWfjE,So no Asian American angel? Tf
RSUq4VfWfjE,LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING OMG
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 COSTUMES OF THE OTHER ANGELS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Weak!
RSUq4VfWfjE,E. Banks: Magic Wand make this Wokeness Grow!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Count me out not spending a dime
RSUq4VfWfjE,This..... I’m kinda disappointed
RSUq4VfWfjE,uhhh no
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but this doesn't look like Charlie's Angels to me. Doesn't feel quite like it either."
RSUq4VfWfjE,ESSE MOMENTO É TODO MEU
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think this is the first time I see Kirsten smile, ever. And what the hell is Luis Gerardo Méndez doing there?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kstew so stunning 💛💛💛
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worth the wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m so excited!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think i prefer the old one. It was so iconic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible trio 🤷🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1. Kristen looks alive!!!!! (that’s an achievement!!!!)
2. Naomi is just a star I LOVE HER
3. A new single by 3 queens, what a trio, who would’ve expected it!! And Ari co-exec produced the soundtrack yessss
4. And also the rest of the cast is amazing aaaaa

Happy with the trailer!! Excited for the movie ❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 i love the reference to the old movies!
RSUq4VfWfjE,The song is lit 🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hell yeah.
RSUq4VfWfjE,this movie is a hot plate of garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,So it's basically kingsmen but with women
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gonna 💣
Besides cool sexy talented Elizabeth Banks and Legendary Patrick Stewart, The 3 new Angels don't stand out as movie action stars and will make the movie fail miserably. Miss the old Angels 😎"
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG I’m so excited for this movie I’m freaking so badly right now 😱♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Omg im in broo, finally my fave k.stew get her alive n exciting  character, i cant wait to watch it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am actually really excited for this. Get ya some Kristen!
RSUq4VfWfjE,warum ?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Charley’s Angels, woke style! All men bad! All SJW buttons pressed!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Instead of remaking, why not make something new? Duh!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well That's not Bad at All..id be watching this for sure 😎👍😉
RSUq4VfWfjE,Release the damn song or we’ll let your film flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Epic flop incoming
RSUq4VfWfjE,Krsiten looks like younger ellen degeneres here lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"damn that looks TERRIBLE, I‘m sure everybody is just watching this trailer for the song"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf another crappy remake
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Professor X, Generic Girl 1, Mega Sonic Teenage Warhead & Androgynous Thing its gonna be one hell of a movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't they just stop remaking these lame movies 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,I appreciate it but of course the original trio own my heart~~~
RSUq4VfWfjE,This look like a badass movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""WhiTe MeN bAd ShOrT hAiReD wOmEn StRonK"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do i feel that this is a live action of totally spies???? I love it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Absolutely empty and stupid movie. There is no zest and charm, unlike the first part."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Fraco. Saudades Cameron, Drew e Lucy"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo anyone? He looks lost outside Netflix
RSUq4VfWfjE,"K Stewart!!!! I’ve always loved her, so glad to see her in something again ❤️❤️❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jomlo na
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like i have a movie to watch in november
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like painfully forced feminism in a film would be perfectly fine and actually empowering without it
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is Naomi's Scott (Princess Jasmine) year!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"0:55
Here's the skip button"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,"3 Girl  , 1 Boss , 1 Bad Guy Who want To Blew World , Sports Car , Gunshots . What's New ??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"You can tell it was directed by a woman because there is cleavage in maybe two shots, not in every single shot like every other female lead in an action movie directed by a man. First thing I noticed!! Stoked for this."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,New Twilight movie ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn that looks badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am missing Cameron Diaz :(
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked it better when it was called Totally Spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miley and Kristen ♥️♥️♥️♥️😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a Disney version of Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,One of the angels reminds me of the best friend in Gossip Girl(Blaire)
RSUq4VfWfjE,the song is annoying as hell
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elena-Natalie
Sabina-Dylan
Jane-Alex

🤔 can’t wait to watch this!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aw isn’t that just cute





THEN JOHN WICK COMES INTO THE ROOM"
RSUq4VfWfjE,yeap... it's as bad as i thought it would be.  Why Patrick Stewart oh why?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ah Jesus gross.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Maybe
RSUq4VfWfjE,So they are back
RSUq4VfWfjE,Dislikes anyone? she's already 18 and drunk
RSUq4VfWfjE,Missing the old badass squad
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here for Ashley O 😬
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Holy crap! That actually looks amazing! I'm gonna miss Cameron, Drew, and Lucy but this looks fun!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Don't call me an A
ngel ... I'm a failure"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Of course Noah Centineo is in this movie...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Been there 
Don’t that
This one will fail also"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I've expected more
RSUq4VfWfjE,New Better Depper.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hope Lana has her own verse in the full song
RSUq4VfWfjE,"well at least they are not making awful men lokes and trying too hard to ""empower "" women. Looks decent enough."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"it doesnt look bad. original one wasnt that great either. keep your expectations low,and you wont be disappointed"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Elizabeth Banks is a great Director...... this will have a sequel, trust me."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The old ones were better
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Remember Power Puff girls?
This is them now!
Feeling old yet?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kistren stewart back babeee
RSUq4VfWfjE,Next Men In Black International in making
RSUq4VfWfjE,boring
RSUq4VfWfjE,2:25 lana del rey 😍👍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just give me the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,I bet it will be better than the TV show
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its nothing like the original and i love it 🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,im glad seeing kristen again tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow. Okay, I was hesitant on the whole thing, but I am in. I should have had more faith in Ms. Elizabeth Banks. :)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I did not become a Independent Woman for this to be the new Charlies Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"My sister: why those two girls look familiar?
Me: look at your room's wall


My sister: OMG! I hope I can see Jacob
*smh*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,ok usually i don't mind remakes but this looks actual trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m crying LANA DEL REY, ARIANA GRANDE, & MILEY CYRUS!!!! THIS IS AMAZING"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm more interested in the new single when does that come out
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOOOO!
RSUq4VfWfjE,KStew is very pretty but this looks so bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For me the Angels will always be Jaclyn Smith, Kate Jackson and Farrah Fawcett-Majors."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sometime it looks like action movie ,
Sometime L'Oréal Paris ad
Sometimes hair wig competition
Sometime it gets woke
Sometime it goes full bollywood 

Girls are hot though , nothing else"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm watching this just because of Kristen Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"🤨 I don't know how I feel about this. I hope its amazing. So many turd reboots in the 2010s, I dont have high hopes for this - I hope I'm wrong so bad!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else is here by Ariana Grande?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks generic. Nothing new. Nothing exciting.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Umm i think i like the old one batter 🤷🏻‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would love to see a crossover between Charlie’s Angels and the three main guys from the movie Triple Threat. The angels need to meet the demons.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen's smokin hot. But they all seem a little low energy in dialogue delivery and in general ... I dunno ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, Kstew the wisecracking action-heroine, huh? 🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Look sh!t. This movie going to flop, You heard it here first."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Alright and intersectional feminist reboot of a movie absolutely NO ONE wanted! FFS Hollywood.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Movie goes to the same trash bin with Ghostbusters and MiB.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Yikes! Nothing sexy here! Big flop! The feminazi's will love it no doubt. The last 2 films were a heap of fun. Oh... yes, when films use to be sexy and fun."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Terrible.
RSUq4VfWfjE,YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BISH SO FUCKING EXCITED CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm getting MIB International vibes from this. Sony is really out here dusting off all these old properties. They  definitely need a break this year. Hopefully the budget is under control. I would be really surprised if this doesn't totally flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like a flop..doesn't look interesting
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow wow wow. Big names for the soundtrack and I love Elizabeth Banks!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen is perfect, OMG!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Women can do anything.
This is pushing too far,the problem is men wont say anything even against a flawed narrative just because they wanma get laid.And if they do they will be shamed even if they are right.
I am sorry,but wasnt the opposite of this the premise of the feminist movement??men and women get equal rights,equal opportunity and not get shamed while protesting something that is not correct.
If women can do anything let them do much more physically demanding jobs and other jobs such as plumbers electricians and not so glamorous jobs such as the military.
Men and women can be intellectually equal but physically definitely isnt.
If you wanna say the sentence women can do anything men can do get some substance behind the statement otherwise it sounds like a wannabe and opportunistic not something empowering"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is gonna be as big a failure as the female ghostbusters movie.  lol.   I loved the original TV series when I was a kid, and the movies with Cameron D, Drew B, Lucy L and Bill M. where a fun guilty pleasure.    This looks like some woke millennial girl power garbage that's been stripped of all the fun and isn't in on the joke.   Hard pass based on this crappy trailer, and really crappy theme song."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This more likely Kingsmen: The Secret Service because of the gadgets 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,YESSS NAOMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charles Xavier with xwomen(Charles angel)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sell sell sell. My advice to people with Sony shares.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Don't know why.....but i love kristen steward
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ariana, lana and miley ALL I NEEDED"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow. This looks bad.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott all the way 🌚♥️
RSUq4VfWfjE,So bosley is now a girl...... okay?
RSUq4VfWfjE,So excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for Noah Centineo ✌🏼. And hell yeah its Charlie’s Angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is sooo fuckin gorgeous
RSUq4VfWfjE,The only reason im watching this movie is because of Ariana Grandes new song...thats IT
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Whoever asked for this, plz get a vasectomy done."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh gosh Noah again
RSUq4VfWfjE,It's too badass. I can't handle the awesome.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Like= original
Comment= this angels"
RSUq4VfWfjE,But WHY!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah centineo was barely acknowledged tho
RSUq4VfWfjE,CHARLIE ANGELS NEEDS ONE ASIAN SPY ! GET IT RIGHT PLEASE SHEESH
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah...I'm gonna wait until it comes on VOD
RSUq4VfWfjE,The movie Will suck so bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,👑
RSUq4VfWfjE,"It looks bland, because it gives us no real sense of what the story is about, generates no tension or intrigue and doesn't make the heroes seem all that interesting or relatable. It's just cool girls bein' effortlessly cool to nice but neutral pop music.

That doesn't mean the movie will be bad, but this trailer is weak sauce."
RSUq4VfWfjE,OK cool where's Lana's voice
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks as Bosley?? Oy...
RSUq4VfWfjE,So the movie is about how much clothes and shoes they have in their closet?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worst trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,"doctor: you only have 5 minutes and 46 seconds to live

me: [watches this twice]"
RSUq4VfWfjE,More like Charlie's Teenagers.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks incredibly cheap: such flat, dull cinematography, sound editing amateurish, this looks like it's not even something for Netflix"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who else went ""Woah Patrick Stewart is in this movie!?!"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,That's...a nope for me dawg
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else was here for Lana but is disappointed now 😔😔
RSUq4VfWfjE,YESEAHSGAKSHSHSHS
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is just so weak.. i think its the song that makes it boring.. i hope theyll change it on trailer 2 makes it more action packed and energetic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Deleting dislikes already I see.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh really? Charlie's Angels isn't enough girl power that you have to make Bosley a woman? Wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,Badass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oke i see bella come be angel's and edward be the batman .. Nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woah woah woah! Freeze at 1:45. The spangled race suit and German girl outfit from the 1999 Charlie’s Angels!
RSUq4VfWfjE,WOKE. THE MOVIE.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I had no expectations whatsoever and I'm pleasingly surprised! I really loved the song!! Can't wait to get the full version!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait....Why Is Logo In The Same Font Style Of Terminator?!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ocean's 8 all over again
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks really dull and unfunny
RSUq4VfWfjE,No feminist men hating scenes... So far. Nice
RSUq4VfWfjE,I saw this on instagram before YouTube somehow
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ok Patrick Stewart can so be Jerry from Totally Spies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why is bosley a woman??? Because 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,"sooo, where’s the queen Lana?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Destiny’s child!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,excited to hear the whole ariana x miley x lana single
RSUq4VfWfjE,"WE WANT THE SONG, NOW!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This actually looks decent. I’ll give it a shot 😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Killing Beauty 
Love from India 💜🔥"
RSUq4VfWfjE,As much as I love the original angels imma give this a watch :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gostei.. finalmente um novo filme! O elenco tbm está legal.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Its not gona work. Rather than sexy the whole thing giving a lesbian feminist vibe. The old ones were way better.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism again
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here for KRISTEN Stewart ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for the soundtrack!
RSUq4VfWfjE,when Princess Jasmine is in a whole new world 😆
RSUq4VfWfjE,망 삘인데??
RSUq4VfWfjE,We knew it
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Every time the music changed I was like ""oh I love this song"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks really tried please give this a chance yall........
RSUq4VfWfjE,kristen stewart in this genre!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another one!?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yea... hard pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this movie exist🤕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ксавье тебя ж убили нахуй
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yine Arap var amına koyayım
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen and Naomi in the same movie...🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why does this trailer make the movie feel like a CW show?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Pass
RSUq4VfWfjE,: - (
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok, I actually liked that and I thought it was going to be a mess."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This actually doesn't look bad at all. Consider me intrigued.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wish they adapt Totally Spies instead.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Im only here for the MYLEY + ARIANA + LANA colab, the movie looks meh."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look stupid
RSUq4VfWfjE,So jasmine ....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Lucy liu, cameron diaz and drew barrymore will be proud"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Esta película se viene con todooo‼️‼️‼️❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Dont touch this there explosives"" BOOM HITS IT AND FELL TO THE GROUND, -FELLA YOU ARE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL-"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m 100% here for this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Liu, Barrymore & Diaz got replaced!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I would really only watch this because of Lana being on soundtrack. Other then that it’s a hard pass for me
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is gay heaven, and that soundtrack? That made it extra gay! :D"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ocean's 3
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Nothing just 






WOW"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The angels are back and they're better than ever!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh great, another FEMALE Remake of a classic movie! 

...I'm just messing with you, this looks pretty great."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lady James bonds
RSUq4VfWfjE,"New member ,,  yeah why not"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks bomb 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Gotta have a lesbian, gotta have a minority, gotta have a fucking Mexican. Why are you excited for this?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 The yodeling outfit from the 2000 movie adoption
RSUq4VfWfjE,"1:54 Luis Gerardo Méndez !! 
Is he making an accent?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I just hope it’s fun at least.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like pure unfiltered AIDS
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did they just copy black widow fight style
RSUq4VfWfjE,Some of these blows up
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is teh Totally Spies live action movie we've been waiting for ages.
RSUq4VfWfjE,If fifth harmony was still here i think their  song “angel” will be the soundtrack coz it really does go with the movie❤️😭😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe Fest
RSUq4VfWfjE,There's no need to remake everything Hollywood. Stop. Get some help
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten Stewart auditioning hard for that Catwoman role lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Once again a politically correct re-make.  If the original angels were all black and the remake was made with one white woman there would be absolute hell to pay.  An uproar.  If Bosley had originally been a woman and replaced by a man there would be absolute hell to pay.  An uproar.  And there are multiple Bosley's in this film.  I know.   Kristen Stewart is a lousy actress.  She acts like a lesbian slug.  This will be a flop.
RSUq4VfWfjE,In before the angry men complaining about the remake of 1976 classic
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks cool
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I think it might be playing a bit too hard on the feminism card here. I get that’s the whole point of this reboot and the original films, but if a film is more about what it’s creation stands for than the entertainment of the film itself, then it does not truly deserve to be made"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart trying hard to show some expressions🤣🤣🤣🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:46 Omg that’s Robert Zussman!! Call of Duty WW2!!! 😦😮😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Really
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is very Ghostbusters reboot. Kristen is who looks more believable and you know, the best character, but I hope all the girls  are actually amazing. 
Waiting for the Queens Ariana, Miley, and the legend Lana."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Aaaaaaaaaannnnddd that's another box office bomb for 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,"There should be another charlies angels but genderswapped this time for the sake of ""equality"". A bunch of dudes with a dude director. Hahahahaha just kidding. Calm your.... whatever."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yeah keep the black girl in the middle literally above all!!😒😒🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hey, am I the only one who is bothered that Patrick Stewart is not credited?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"AHHA I KNEW I5,!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Shouldn’t the Angels be played by male actors, since Hollywood is playing this stupid game now?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth Banks should stay as an actor... Not a director
RSUq4VfWfjE,Y’all better not forget the 70s Charlie’s angel
RSUq4VfWfjE,THIS LOOKS AMAZING so glad Naomi Scott is having this great breakthrough
RSUq4VfWfjE,Felt old watching this...😭 can't beat the originals though....😛
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am not sure how I feel about this...
RSUq4VfWfjE,waiting for the soundtrack for first !!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Djimon Hounsou, my love."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Booooo!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wanna watch soon!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks exciting!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Third class they can't compare the original 😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott looks more prettier than Kristen Stewart or just she is.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is like the second remake Naomi Scott and Elizabeth Banks have filmed together.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wish we could hear vocals from Lana in the trailer. I hope that the song has enough timing with Lana's vocals.  When's the track coming out though!!??
RSUq4VfWfjE,0:55 Sponsored by Audi....hahahahaha
RSUq4VfWfjE,arianaaaa
RSUq4VfWfjE,Spoiler: The handsome nerd is the real villain
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hard pass on this garbage. CRINGE👎🏾🗑
RSUq4VfWfjE,Promising
RSUq4VfWfjE,is it me...or has digital become the new B movie? Like Netflix originals. Not sure why but this seems cheap even though its not lol idk
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for Lana! 💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,New season of Totally Spies looks fire!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I want a cameo from the old angels i am  begging
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop detected! This movie will bomb so much. 🤔🤣
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love me some gay KStew!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is GORGEOUS!!!! 💖
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kinda wish it was just Ariana and lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks boring. They should reboot it by giving it a new look. Make it dark and gritty and sexy
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen is new charlies angel ,Robert P is new batman wow time can heal wounds  made twilight to them!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks absolutely awful. I can't think of a series that doesn't need a reboot more than Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ok, I guess I'm not the only one who thought 'what is this!?' and then inmediately went to re watch the charlie's angel from 2000 and 2003 to realize this looks so boring. Is ok for the people who like this, but for me this movie looks awful."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Featuring Lana Del Rey? Only heard her say 4 words and like 3 of them were the same word and she was whispering she better have way more in the actual song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ho gaya inka chutiyapa chalu kya yeh wahi hollywood hai jisne interstellar jaisi film banai thi?
RSUq4VfWfjE,everything started more than 40 years ago
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop flop flop bad casting
RSUq4VfWfjE,Misericórdia eu tô surtando com a voz da Lana del rey no final aaaaa meu deuuus
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is 😍❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am really looking forward to this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"at first i was sad they took the ‘asian’ one off, ‘til i realized we got a much better indian rep instead 💁‍♀️🤷‍♀️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I NEED THIS SONG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ohhh it's a reboot. I get it now. Awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,Javi Noble!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,N A O M I !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m down.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks entertainingly generic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why the dislikes in this one🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is a charlie's Angel and Robert Pattinson is batman ( we are all doomed).
RSUq4VfWfjE,It would be really awesome if the original charlie's angels would have a cameo on this movie. I'll keep on dreaming.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Robert Pattinson didn't like this trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Imo I think Kristen finally is in a movie that actually suits her
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why doesn't Bella just use her powers to help them out?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who said they can’t be our Angels 😉sorry
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was getting super excited until noah centineo showed up on my screen...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott a.k.a. yung clone Sarah Michelle Gellar
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I still like the old one better, but this...is okay, not bad, but in my opinion, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu Charlie angels is still the best."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't we ever get anything original.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Trash
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another chick flick that's gonna flop..
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought it was a male reboot!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ehh....kristen stewart, couldnt they have found someone better??"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay at 1:06 Naomi is legit cute!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"At least Hollywood has now found something that does not require gender-swapping and still has women as the main characters. 

Now I just hope that this won't be another in-your-face feminazi kind of movie with all sorts of not-so-subtle man-hating-ishly lines.

Just PLEASE let this be an action flick with focus on a great action story rather than a political platform for a feminist agenda."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Um yes yes yes Double triple yes
RSUq4VfWfjE,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
RSUq4VfWfjE,This feels like Totally Spies but I'M HERE FOR IT
RSUq4VfWfjE,The music in this trailer is so bad! I don't like the trailer.
RSUq4VfWfjE,ELIZABETH BANKS name's everywhere...
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks meh and that cringey music doesn't help either
RSUq4VfWfjE,Will be a huge bomb at the box office!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,When is the whole song going to come out so I can hear Lana because I barely heard her here and does anyone know if they’re going to do a music video?!💕💕💕💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ugh...
RSUq4VfWfjE,JASMINE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi scott ?? Am in

RSUq4VfWfjE,sksksksk SO ready for this !💗
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hm...not exactly sure what to make of it. It feels like a spy movie with Charlie’s Angels slapped on it, but we’ll see"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why do I get feminism vibes from the first 15 seconds...
RSUq4VfWfjE,There needs to be a camero from the trio from the 2000s.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for Lana Del Rey. PeriodT.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Patrick stewart

RSUq4VfWfjE,Are they charles Xavier angels? 😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wouldn't have a problem with a new CA's saga if it didn't look like absolute crap.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hope Bill Murray makes an appearance in this one
RSUq4VfWfjE,How do you manage to make a spy movie look dull?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay so I only heard Lana on the end. NOT COOL SONY. NOT COOL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Vim pela Lana Del Rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only reason to see this is Patrick Stewart.

RSUq4VfWfjE,this is so white
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else agree that Kirsten Stewart    will look like Ellen DeGeneres in the future ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"did they just throw every female thing at it hoping we would see this, they are just throwing all the female things at all and seeing what sticks now...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay.. Will nobody talk about Noah Centineo?

RSUq4VfWfjE,I just don't like this period...I like original tho.
RSUq4VfWfjE,100% Garbarge.........
RSUq4VfWfjE,cheesy
RSUq4VfWfjE,The reboot nobody asked for.
RSUq4VfWfjE,GIVRE US THIS SONG ALREADY!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Everything is great until that guy from every cliche Netflix movies showed up. He can't even act.
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:45 Easter egg from the old reboot Charlie’s angels!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,2019 is naomi scott’s year wow

RSUq4VfWfjE,Yup....this is what the world been asking for and needs.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Just because they can doesn't mean they should."" Even the trailer suggests that this is a bad idea. *facepalm*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wowwwww muero por verla !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I seen this movie like a week ago through Fobo it was actually pretty cool and sexy Noami Scott yeeeeess!!

RSUq4VfWfjE,Daaaaaamn mann blown up 😍😍🤗🤗🤗
RSUq4VfWfjE,“Totaly Spice” movie ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,It should have been an All-Male Reboot of Charlie's Angels.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If you didn't took Drew Barrymore as a Boseley....i am not interested...
But still i wanna watch"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's still alive?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 💕😍😍 muth

RSUq4VfWfjE,"After watching the trailer, i have no idea what was happening, because i tried to pay attention to the song in the background."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn the black chick looks bad!!! 😁😁 but the movie looks really bad.😝😝
RSUq4VfWfjE,eXCUSE ME MA'AM
RSUq4VfWfjE,Excuse me but why are the Charlie's Angels not men this time?.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I. AM. ALL. IN.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Female empowerment focus? Prepare yourselves, the incels are coming!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,zendaya would be perfect for kristin role why they didnt give it to her
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'll be honest, that didn't look like it sucked. I'll watch it."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was expecting for a cringe inducing SJW dialogue somewhere in the trailer. Oh boy they did not disappoint.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Shitty movie with shitty music. Seriously,  there is no class or at least an attempt at originality. Can California fall into the dawn ocean yet?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,The mocha chocolate girl is the cutest!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island today at 1 on Boomerang
RSUq4VfWfjE,If this doesn't have well choreographed back to back hand to hand  fight scenes .... I'll be dissapointed

RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn! Princess Jasmine
RSUq4VfWfjE,NA.
RSUq4VfWfjE,but why tf is the third angel not even an angel and untrained? wtf? all three have always been on equal footing in previous installments. this is ugly and the elizabeth banks character seems redundant if they have charlie there.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not enough Noah Centineo 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,When you realize people are more excited for the song release then the movie😭😭😭😂😂😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:44 I understood that reference
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is gonna do as well as it looks..shitty. But ill give u props for star power
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think it’s gonna be a movie that everyone is talking about but it will flop at least on box office.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Having Ariana, Miley, and Lana sing together they must know this movie sucks already"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm screeming
RSUq4VfWfjE,II don't like the angels because they don't have charisma like the previous movie ... but I will watch this for Patrick Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,All I want is the original Angels made a cameo. That's all..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart as an angel? No thank you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,So jasmine is for real in a whole new world
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen + Lana + Miley 😍😍
Omg im on fire 💃💃💃💞💞"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is it me or does this look wack
RSUq4VfWfjE,They can not match the old ones! Never! These girls look so skinny! And young!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Worst trailer I've ever seen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wow I love totally spies !

Lol jk I know its a Charlie's Angel's remake"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah Centineo?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Heck YES !!!This looks awesome!!😁😁😁
RSUq4VfWfjE,This trailer is such a mess😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Woww güzel
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here for lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,Elizabeth banks could be perfect Angel like Cameron diaz
RSUq4VfWfjE,I sleep.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHO CAME HERE FOR MILEY?
RSUq4VfWfjE,i’m here for miley cyrus
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a lot of fun!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No just no.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope they didn't show the whole movie. First time seeing Ella Balinska and she is badass.
RSUq4VfWfjE,At last... You don't know how excited I am about this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's angles reboot😅😅
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG ARIANAAAA
RSUq4VfWfjE,The castings is poor
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is amazing. Can't wait to see this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can’t wait for the full male cast reboot in a few years for gender diversity
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Just one word "" WOW"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,Boring trailer not a single percent os interesting than old Charlie's Angel's 2000 2003
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I have to be honest I don't even know a lot about LDR but seeing the comment section made me hella disappointed for those fans. Hopefully in full song there is more for Lana. Anyway, keep cheering for all of them and a movie guys. 
Have to say Kristen is just wow."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait..we get to see Kristen Stewart dance here? Ok take my money
RSUq4VfWfjE,Waduheck
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who is Playing the Main Villain in this New Movie ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t understand Elizabeth Banks humor or taste, it’s like she’s been frozen since the 80s. How is it possible to make a Charlie’s Angels movie that looks worse than the McG directed Charlie’s Angels ?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A very very great combo 😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Negative
RSUq4VfWfjE,If the original trio have a cameo in this then that will be freaking great
RSUq4VfWfjE,GIMMIE THE DAMN SOUNDTRACK NOW NOW NOW
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think im here before this goes viral
RSUq4VfWfjE,Bella and Jasmine woah❤😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another B's movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks fun so far :)
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't wait for the soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,holy crap kristen stewart has more than one emotion
RSUq4VfWfjE,Can't waitttt OMG.. I love all the cast wow.. thank you for making this film. And I can see KRISTEN STEWART AGAIN WOW so excited
RSUq4VfWfjE,I actually liked it more than the Cameron Dias version
RSUq4VfWfjE,another rebooted franchise which will flop
RSUq4VfWfjE,Definitely not made for 40 year old white guys.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sir please put about cosmic armour Superman vs dr Manhattan
RSUq4VfWfjE,I like Elizabeth Banks as an actress and a Boston person... But this feels like a box office bomb
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks so awful haha
RSUq4VfWfjE,More feminism fuelled rubbish
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Oh wow, I actually got bored and went to the comments halfway through"
RSUq4VfWfjE,NWO
RSUq4VfWfjE,I see just Kristen Stewart playing Miley Cyrus biopic
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lezzzbe honest here for Kristen
RSUq4VfWfjE,TUUUUUDUOOOOOOO
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feels more Totally Spies than Charlie's Angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for the soundtrack.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was expecting a woke dumpster fire but this is actually alright.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have mixed feelings with the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so horrible. It's obvious someone at Sony said... let's take Fast and the Furious and mix it with Mission Impossible. Sony needs new executives if this is the best that they can come up with.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart 🔥🔥🔥🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cringe
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Power Rangers 2
RSUq4VfWfjE,Noah as a handsome nerd? Guys I live 😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott . That’s it that’s the comment
RSUq4VfWfjE,So this is what feminists watch....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love how most of the comments here are about the song and not about the movie haha.... Miley sounds like a badass, Ariana's voice is smooth and i love Lana's whispering... Can't wait for it! I hope they get to perform it live and also film a badass video as the three angels!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,There has to be more shots of Kristen Stewart smiling in this trailer than in her whole filmography so far. It is somewhat refreshing.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is hot
RSUq4VfWfjE,Cool lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, 🤩song's dope.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,im a lesbian
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm going to watch the movie just because Lana is on the soundtrack.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I didn't see any SJW propaganda,  lo0ks ok"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart and Lana Del Rey is my gems 💦✌️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"The film nobody asked for, that noone will see. What a complete waste of money."
RSUq4VfWfjE,just showed up to give it the downvote
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who else here for Noah Centineo?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie's Angels: Mission Money Grab.
RSUq4VfWfjE,A whole new world....
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, I paid attention to the music more than the trailer. Soo sorry."
RSUq4VfWfjE,IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"naomi, kristen, ariana....omg
NOVEMBER?!!!! wtf!!! then why ur showing me this now!!!!😠"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought Charlie's Angels were meant to be attractive? Elizabeth Banks is the hottest one here. The others are fugly as sin.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"NO ONE ELSE ASKED YOU WHO YOU CAME FOR TO SEE, PERIODT."
RSUq4VfWfjE,ICONIC!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"bravo movie team, you dissappointed us. this contains only *1% lana del rey.* you used her name as a tag, I don't wanna just hear lana ""whispering"" in the song."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here for Lana Del Rey
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was looking foward to this until it turned into kingsman
RSUq4VfWfjE,"OMFG seriously? 1st off, this looks WORSE than the original with Cameron Diaz, which was HORRIBLE etc and when was there a black Woman in Charlies Angels? There was never a lesbian in Charlies Angel either, they all liked MEN! The acting in this movie looks GROSS, from this trailer! A cast that can't act, great start! -_-"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks stunning ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,RIP creativity 2019
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Hit like for
Drew Barrymore...❤️

RSUq4VfWfjE,"Eu esperava muito menos socorro, amei a prévia do soundtrack e o Cast tbm tá ótimo <3 tem até Bombastic da Bonnie na trilha  kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow Hollywood writers! Is this the best they could come up with!? Flicks & Reboots!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Should I expect Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu to make a cameo?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sony: we have stewart
Me: I'm in"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"If patrick stewart isnt charle or basil, Who the hell is he?"

RSUq4VfWfjE,Another feminist film ...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am soooo excited for kristen stewart!!! And rob is batman! Omagad don't fight me. I am a huge twilight fan sorry not sorry😎😎😎
RSUq4VfWfjE,the only real CharliesAngels for me Cameron Diaz  Drew Barrymore  Lucy Liu
RSUq4VfWfjE,So those three girls are look like a Totally Spies from Cartoon Network.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Theres also Noah Centineo why isnt anyone talking ab him
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Um-------yh... kinda cheesy and dont know yet
We'll see after more commercials and TV spots"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i like it!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for girls. period.
RSUq4VfWfjE,por um momento achei que fosse um filme das 3 espiãs demais
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love that jasmine so much,"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I liked the trailer 👍 new and fresh
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm more excited about the song! Miley ariana and Lana snapped
RSUq4VfWfjE,"pink ranger/princess jasmine, bella cullen, and rita repulsa in 1 movie. okay this looks awesome"
RSUq4VfWfjE,These are the kind of movies we need!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"To princess Jasmine to a killer spy🤣
I like ❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So where’s the song
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m glad Charlie is still a man.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ew
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I suppose the song will be called ""don't call me angel"".
I can not wait for the full song."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I LOVE IT OMFG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Anyone actually here for the movie and the song at the same time?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Tbh, this looks bad"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I am here kristen Stewart and Ariana grande
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just the trailer only have so many typical action movies about secret organisation tropes in it
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart looks pretty fierce in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How many Naomi Scott fans in the house?
↓👇"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Only here for Ariana Grande, to be honest. 🤷‍♀️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nice trailer for a song
RSUq4VfWfjE,BOMBASTIC
RSUq4VfWfjE,Confusing AF
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Film's name : *Charlie's Angels*
Featured song : *Don't call me Angel*"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Flop this movie will be.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are the better angels from 2000, not these girls."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who's here because of Catch That Kid?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Angels dont need guns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be bad af tbh
RSUq4VfWfjE,2/10
RSUq4VfWfjE,Came here for Naomi baby 💋
RSUq4VfWfjE,I might see it for half price. Nothing spectacular here.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I like the actresses and Patrick Steward is always amazing the too. This trailer makes the movie look like a totally uninspired, forgettable, cut & paste action-snorefest though."
RSUq4VfWfjE,YAWN!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Does anyone else thinks that Naomi Scott looks like Abella Danger or is it just me, probably a side affect of watching her too much!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is a GODDESS
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu will always be better"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Why are people liking this?  This looks like the worst movie ever made.  Ever.  Why isn’t one of them a trans in a wheelchair?  Not progressive enough.

This garbage is why I don’t go the movies anymore.  Give us better content, or we’ll stop spending our money on you.  Women do not beat up men.  It doesn’t work that way.  

Stop pretending the world could be this way, it never will."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I was always hoping for Charlie’s Angels 3 but after seeing this I’m really excited!
RSUq4VfWfjE,ok so it is going to remind you of your childhood damnnn. PS: it used to be my softcore porn once.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I’m here I here ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart though. Damn!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm here for soundtrack
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks SO BAD.  Kristen Stewart really just....can't act.  And the rest isn't going to carry her.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Idk about this.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Here for Naomi Scott and Ariana Grande.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Absolute garbage. Thanks for sucking all the fun out of charlies angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart is so going to have an incredible year between this movie and Against All Enemies. My gurl is serving lewks!
RSUq4VfWfjE,It actually looks better than I expected-
RSUq4VfWfjE,crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,Damn i love seeing Stewart...
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is gonna be so terrible.... omg sjw right from the get go.... 🤦‍♂️

RSUq4VfWfjE,IT’s like contains 1 % LANA I AM TRIGGERED
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ow man, soundtracks❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,HOPE THIS DOES NOT DISAPPOINT
RSUq4VfWfjE,It should have been charles' angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ariana Grande, Lana Del Ray, and Mikey Cyrus should be the angels imo."
RSUq4VfWfjE,DON'T CALL ME ANGEL
RSUq4VfWfjE,Мусор
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Luis Gerardo la esta haciendo, que emoción"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"99% Talking about Ariana, Miley, and Lana
1% Talking about the trailer
Thank you all for this many likes!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks a shitty remake of a silly movie franchise while trying to have the action of the Kingsmen
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Naomi Scott is killing is this year. Aladdin and Charlie's Angels. 
She is finally getting the recognition she deserves. Such a beauty and talent."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kirsten stewart is an actress
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, this looks wack, aint got nothing Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and my wife Lucy Lui"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm so ready and excited for this ariana Lana del ray Miley cyrus collab
RSUq4VfWfjE,Não
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for Ariana❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,"@ElizabethBanks
Like you, and the trailer alot.
 The only thing I really dislike is that, there isnt any FLUFFY girls in the trailer and probably not in the movie either.
Come on, we fluffy girls can fight etc too :("
RSUq4VfWfjE,Miss the vibe of Lucy Lui 😊
RSUq4VfWfjE,Soundtrack! Awesome. Movie ughhhhh
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nah
RSUq4VfWfjE,wcu is back------women cinematic universe
RSUq4VfWfjE,Female kingsman?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Meh.... They should’ve called this Charles Xavier’s Angels or X-Men: Lesbians
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG Arianators +1 :))
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lana Del Rey I love youuu
RSUq4VfWfjE,NOAH CENTINIO
RSUq4VfWfjE,Она умеет улыбаться!!!😃 Да. Теперь я видел всё.😄👏
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana ♡
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I heard more Ariana than Lana or Miley, wtf on the snippet💀"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I DIDN'T HEARD LANA!!!!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ugh I really wish it still starred Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Berrymore"
RSUq4VfWfjE,i am excited for the song! 😍❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,who steal humatain aid money? the goverments...but i aussme you didnt know that?
RSUq4VfWfjE,so bad movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Lanaaa ❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,💕
RSUq4VfWfjE,This still looks like a McG movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Now we're talking about Charlie Xavier XD
RSUq4VfWfjE,im degusting
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen Stewart ❤️. It's been a while.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'm Here For K-Stew 😍🤩🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,I feel like I watched the whole movie in that trailer. Naomi Scott is the entry character who starts off as a lowly IT nerd who becomes a badass spy. That's the whole movie.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I so wanted a drew cameo in this
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Tom Hanks Charlie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"ARIANA, MILEY AND LANA SANG THE OTS!!!!!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,lanaaaaa
RSUq4VfWfjE,When this fails they should try a version with Charlie's Angels all being fat dudes. At least that would be more believable.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"All 90s kids so excited after trailer released ...we give 10/10 this movie...and ""Girls always Girls"""
RSUq4VfWfjE,it looks awwwwwwwesooooooome!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"funny how they didn’t even tease lana’a voice here,Ugh the anticipation is Real!!😩🙏"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks ok but that is all.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This movie is gonna flop so hard.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only here for Ariana and miley
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I just realize...If we joined these two parts, it’s formed a Diamond. 
Fact. 2:50"
RSUq4VfWfjE,so unnecessary
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow 😍 superb❤️🔥 🔥👌 👌
RSUq4VfWfjE,We in it together but don’t call me angel.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here only for Kristen and Ariana😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This new trailer for Fast and Furious looks so .... wait! seriously ?, let me laugh even louder lol!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,A blonde long hair Bella would have been nice'r
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Here to see Naomi Scott ❤ My Pretty Queen😍 No offense to the other two ladies, I also love them but Naomi is just so freaking gorgeous ❤"
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like it could be fun.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks promising 😌😌
RSUq4VfWfjE,"So, we just gonna ignore the fact that Patrick Stewart’s in this movie?!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hot woman sells
RSUq4VfWfjE,nice reference there in the closet to the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hey... Esto ha llamado mucho mi atención :0
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wait.. Angels use guns now?
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow look better than i thought i hope it great.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why not the mask is remade
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wouldn’t watch this if you paid me.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Niiiceee
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so bad man lol
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott! From the Pink Ranger to Princess Jasmine to this! Love her! <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""We're gonna need some wigs"" you're tellin me"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I love but angels but I am here for the single, release it already 😅"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Bosley(dia I spell right?) Is a woman now?
Interesting🤔🤔🤔"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Feminism the movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,PUTA Q PARIU MEU CORAÇÃO
RSUq4VfWfjE,wow naomi scott back to back in iconic roles..
RSUq4VfWfjE,Never had any hope...But DAMN....That's some Cheerios stuff
RSUq4VfWfjE,"""Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings.."" :)"
RSUq4VfWfjE,RELEASED THE SONG FOR THE SUMMER
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Damn, Naomi Scott is on a roll! YOU GO GIRL!"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Loved the original Charlies Angels and i cant wait for this one!

RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG!!! Noah <3
RSUq4VfWfjE,What a disgrace....
RSUq4VfWfjE,No Japanese or Chinese girl??((
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hehehehehe......no
RSUq4VfWfjE,Old expectations with new angles 😉 🤞
RSUq4VfWfjE,oh kristen stewart is so hot...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is that Sir Patrick Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This is not a movie trailer, this is an ad for a bland typical 2019 song. I want to see a trailer, please. Because I like this cast."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I'M HYPED 🤩🤩🤩
RSUq4VfWfjE,Come on where are the cgi and the flying chicks. That's what I want to see. Not another MI clone with chicks☹️
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Aladdin. The Lion King. Godzilla. Charlies Angels....did i die and go back in time by , like, 20 years?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,WHERE IS THE SONG
RSUq4VfWfjE,"YAY, another reboot........ -_-"
RSUq4VfWfjE,im gonna need a cameron drew lucy cameo tho or else i'll be in severe depression
RSUq4VfWfjE,"HAHAHAHAH, where's Lana? only on 2:26 and in the end, where she on back vocal? HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA still sounds like a joke"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I wish they use other black girl that has the same height as the other girls. This one is too tall. And kristen looks painfully lesbian.
RSUq4VfWfjE,so they teased us for little lana at 2:26 so we have to wait for the full song
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wtf where is Lana????
RSUq4VfWfjE,"How did Charlie survive being turned into a woman? Seriously, it seems bit over feminized."
RSUq4VfWfjE,The whole movie is just the trailer for the single😂
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Well, Jasmine's on her own magic carpet ride.
Also, I wish to have that song pls asap, thanks."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"This looks like complete trash, but of course Noah Centipede is in it so i have to freaking see it to make fun of him."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Couldnt Go thru the whole trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,JANELLE MONÁE
RSUq4VfWfjE,Princess Scott just awesome
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Ok this doesn't actually look that bad.
Sidenote, why are they turning my favorite comic book characters into females but the angels stay female? But yea its nice to see kristen with a facial expression, and Patrick Stewart, i might go see it"
RSUq4VfWfjE,feels like it's gonna flop hard...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Boring.... Cameron, Drew and Lucy has real personality"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I need a video clip for the song ASAP
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg can't wait for the soundtrack!!💘
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG LOVE IT!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"for those who are asking, Make Me Feel was the first song played, it was performed and sung by Janelle Monaé 🙂"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Humor again? It suposed to be only action 😒
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who asked for this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,where’s lana ?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Love it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Am I the only one who thinks the logo looks like Triumph?
RSUq4VfWfjE,"they really shoulda just continued the franchise with Cameron, Drew and Lucy tbh"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came for the handsome nerd. And I was not disappointed ^^
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm SO excited for this movie, soundtrack and Kristen Stewart's BDE"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Watch latest gaming video's tutorials and much more

RSUq4VfWfjE,Why the loud soundtrack? Very annoying. Had to leave it midway.
RSUq4VfWfjE,I thought Charlie picked hot girls...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I don’t get the SEX vibes the OG radiated.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Angels, Picard and Tunes.

Yes, thank you very kindly."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I expected a lot of dislike for this trailer...thankfully its not happening
RSUq4VfWfjE,I DON'T HEAR LANA ONLY ARIANA AND A BIT OF MILEY WHERE IS LANAAAAAA
RSUq4VfWfjE,SRSLY?! 🤢
RSUq4VfWfjE,Look so bad...
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow I can’t wait
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I miss the coolness and swag of drew, lucy and cameron"
RSUq4VfWfjE,😉😢😠😯😉😈😆😯😡😡😡😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
RSUq4VfWfjE,Omg. That sucks. This looks like a TV Budget teen version of the early movies.
RSUq4VfWfjE,IF LANA DOESNT GET A WHOLE VERSE WE suing
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t mean this to sound snarky, but it’s nice to see Kristen Stewart in a role where she (or at least her character) seems like they’re genuinely having fun/not brooding."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Looks like it’s underwhelming
RSUq4VfWfjE,❤❤❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,I didnt think id see kristen stewart in a Funny movie. Like ever
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not bad
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen Stewart😍😍😍😍
Damn gorgeous"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I hope Indonesian cinema will show this movie😭❤
RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomii
RSUq4VfWfjE,seems like another crap
RSUq4VfWfjE,"is it just me ? who came here just because my Princess 👑, Naomi 👌🏻."
RSUq4VfWfjE,whole thing looks as a slow premium trash.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Oh boy.....( I mean angels!) am ready for a wild ride alright.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Kristen is b-e-a-u-tiful!
RSUq4VfWfjE,🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks promising. Then again it could be terrible like Baywatch but we'll just have to wait and see 🤔
RSUq4VfWfjE,"KRISTEN FUCKING STEWART,, MY GUY"
RSUq4VfWfjE,garbage
RSUq4VfWfjE,Only coz of Naomi Scott 💕💯🔥
RSUq4VfWfjE,Didnt know the Twillight girl has more than 2 facial expressions.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Na fam.. Na!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I have my doubts but I will give this a shot.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"watched 2.5 mins of trailer just to hear a phrase from the real angel. Lana, i’m here for you.❤️"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Just here for the Ari/Miley/Lana collab
RSUq4VfWfjE,Gayyyy
RSUq4VfWfjE,Who came for Naomi Scott? 😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,It doesn’t look terrible ❤️
RSUq4VfWfjE,1:36 Ariana voice angle 😘😘😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,meh...seems very generic.
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Who came here for Miley, Ariana and Lana?"
RSUq4VfWfjE,78% Ariana   20% miley  2% Lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI SCOTT ☺️💕🎶🤗
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Kristen is a whore and a homewrecker,just a reminder who are you cheering on"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hotness Stewart
RSUq4VfWfjE,Why just why??
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Come on...how many more movies like this do we need? Women assassins who are rogue, blah blah blah. If you're gonna be an action star...look the part. That's all I'm saying. Look at all the guys in the Marvel Cinematic universe. They spend weeks getting in physical shape so they are trading blows with the bad guys...you believe they can do it. These women looked like they just rolled out of bed and onto a movie set."
RSUq4VfWfjE,This actually looks very promising !
RSUq4VfWfjE,"a big no from me, lack the charm of the old movies...a new MIB International in the making...."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for Lana queen
RSUq4VfWfjE,Sieht doch gar nicht mal schlecht aus

RSUq4VfWfjE,"I'm here for Ariana, Miley and Kristen and i want Ari in the movie"
RSUq4VfWfjE,Hindi trailer Kbhi Ayega
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where's Lana? I only hear Ariana screaming like she always does. i-
RSUq4VfWfjE,I literally don’t care about the movie I’m just here for lana
RSUq4VfWfjE,OMG KRISTEN 💜💜💜
RSUq4VfWfjE,well this looks bad...
RSUq4VfWfjE,the tongue clicks give me hereditary flashbacks...
RSUq4VfWfjE,"besides the amazing soundtrack, the movie actually looks interesting we will be watching"
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI ? KRISTEN ? NOAH CENTINEO ? I’M SCREAMING
RSUq4VfWfjE,I heard lana's part and i actually... kinda...expected it!! 🤷🏻‍♂️
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think I will pass on it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,why am i bored and typing this while the trailer plays something that interests me not one bit.
RSUq4VfWfjE,WE NEED THE SONG
RSUq4VfWfjE,Another movie remake or the alternative retelling movie?
RSUq4VfWfjE,who else came here for ariana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,I m rooting for it 😃😃😃😃... Great cast n looks very promising 😗
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I’m already singing “we in it together, but don’t call me angel” over and over 😂 love you Lana"
RSUq4VfWfjE,this is real?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Not bad!! looks legit fun...
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think we already saw all best scenes from the trailer
RSUq4VfWfjE,looks like jasmine meet vampire and rita repulsa
RSUq4VfWfjE,We want music please
RSUq4VfWfjE,Wow i'm a woman and this looks terrible. Just another hollywood Femi-Nazi grab to get women to see this movie. And by the looks of the comments so many are taking the bait. Ughhhhhhh this movie looks trash and arianas music suckssss. NEXT☕
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where is the Chinese one ??? Or any exotic one ?? Tf?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks so stupid. I love it!
RSUq4VfWfjE,This is looking really fun. I like it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks FUN!
RSUq4VfWfjE,No
RSUq4VfWfjE,THEY SNAAAPPEEED IT😍😍😍😍
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine you promised to go see the world with Aladdin!!!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,NAOMI OMG I FREAKING LOVE HER SO MUCH
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I can already tell, best movie of the century."
RSUq4VfWfjE,"For the American supernatural corporate woman


In Kiss the Girls (1997), Kate McTiernan and Alex Cross are the red and blue of the Hollywood colour system; in the system, red and blue are the anti anti of the formation anti intellect anti, whose purpose is to force a glamour entity to stare at evil so that reality can defend the ability to see"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Great songs , movie not imprest"
RSUq4VfWfjE,I love Women but No not this movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!
RSUq4VfWfjE,Did nobody noticed Noah? ):
RSUq4VfWfjE,how to fail before start!
RSUq4VfWfjE,I AM SHOOK
RSUq4VfWfjE,Im sick of seeing noah centrino everywhere
RSUq4VfWfjE,I think we ALL are excited for the soundtrack 😉
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Sorry, girls, but I’m here only for Noah Centineo XD"
RSUq4VfWfjE,THE AUDIENCE WANTS THE DAMN SONG NOW
RSUq4VfWfjE,is it a trailer or a music video? can’t tell
RSUq4VfWfjE,"wow.. really? i thought this ""Totally Spies"" live action.."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Okay this movie looks dope but CAN WE TALK ABOUT ARI LANA & MILEY LIKE WOW HOW FUCKING ICONIC
RSUq4VfWfjE,Yes
RSUq4VfWfjE,She can act haters
RSUq4VfWfjE,"LANA, MILEY, AND ARI all in *ONE SONG?* Y'all are giving the girls and gays exactly what they want!!! ⛷"
RSUq4VfWfjE,More comment in here loving the song more than the actual trailer. lol. Song = Great! Movie = Meh!
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Wait, why is the black girl so damn tall????? How can she be in disguise and be inconspicuous when she’s like 7 feet tall? It doesn’t matter what disguise she wears because she’ll be the only tree sized woman in the area. I feel like that’s going to distract me and make the movie lose some of its “reality” because no spy would be that tall lol"
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Not gonna lie, im going to see this movie purely for Kristen Stewart`s lesbian eye candy.
I screamed 3 times during this trailer, just fangirling over her outfits."
RSUq4VfWfjE,Jasmine is free now and killing it.
RSUq4VfWfjE,Ariana Grande & Miley Cyrus are My #1 Angel since Disney recognizes their sides of Disneyworld and Disney Channel my childhood stars! 🦈💖👌👍👊🐇🤝✌🤙😘
RSUq4VfWfjE,No thank you.
RSUq4VfWfjE,*Who remembers the old school Charlie's Angels?*
RSUq4VfWfjE,I miss Cameron Diaz + Drew Barrymore + Lucy Liu so much 😭
RSUq4VfWfjE,Is Aladdin in this?
RSUq4VfWfjE,Where are my arianators at????
RSUq4VfWfjE,JUAN CARLOS !!!
RSUq4VfWfjE,this looks fantastic! Can't wait!
RSUq4VfWfjE,That’s a big no for me. You lost me with the song & that already set expectations extremely low!~! 🤦🏽‍♀️
RSUq4VfWfjE,Nope
RSUq4VfWfjE,Charlie is like the Big Boss using Alexa to talk to angels
RSUq4VfWfjE,"I don’t how I feel about this.... 
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore & Lucy Liu will always be the original three «Charlie’s Angels»"
RSUq4VfWfjE,So it’s basically Totally Spies in my opinion
RSUq4VfWfjE,Well i can't hear Lana?
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks terrible!
RSUq4VfWfjE,DROP THE SONG ALREADY WHAT IS U DOIINNN
RSUq4VfWfjE,where is Lana's voice??

RSUq4VfWfjE,Naomi Scott is the rookie and hopefully she is audience’s main favorite in this movie
RSUq4VfWfjE,"Less than 50% on Rotten Tomatoes and less than 250m worldwide. Kristen Stewart may have a following, but is box office poison."
RSUq4VfWfjE,I came here for Kristen Stewart and Naomi Scott :)

RSUq4VfWfjE,Why are only A-cup and B-cup women allowed in movies and on TV? Busty women are essentially banned from being actresses. That's not fair to women.
RSUq4VfWfjE,This looks like a horrible SJW woman power crap fest.... ESPECIALLY cause of Kristen Stewert…. nothing will beat the original....
RSUq4VfWfjE,The Fact im hyped about the movie and the song and why is no one giving the black girl any love she definitely is a badass and I find it funny how they made her keep her accent and Naomi changed hers

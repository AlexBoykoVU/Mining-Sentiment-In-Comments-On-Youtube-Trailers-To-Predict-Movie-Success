5PSNL1qE6VY,@lisenbeeable It won't bebecause of that piece of crap people call new moon :[
5PSNL1qE6VY,the critics are saying its the best movie in 3d and by james cameron (director)
5PSNL1qE6VY,"So, what do the HUMANS eat???

If the planet is TOXIC to humans, then what do they do for food???

They CAN'T use the soil, they CAN'T eat the wildlife, and it takes 5 years for them to get to Pandora...

Plus why not just ""liquidate"" the SAVAGES???""

They OBVIOUSLY have NOTHING to offer us but PROFIT LOSS???

This latest  bit O' ""kvetching"" is for my GOOD FRIEND ""nickycash"" (AKA. Polyanna)

What good is SWEET ""NICKY"" when you have nothing SOUR to compare it to???

Life is good..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Oh my goodness. Me and my kids couldn't wait to watch this movie this saturday morning...
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Aw, what's the matter ""nicky"", did I ruin christmas 4 U???

Look ""PAL"", if I wanna point out the BLATANT INCONSISTENCIES of the DAMN MOVIE, then that's MY PERROGATIVE!!! 

The ONLY difference between ME & a ""critic"" is that the the ""critic"" gets paid.

Wow, if your SOOO upset over my CRITIQUE of Avatar, you must've REALLY been TEARY-EYED & DEPRESSED when you friend told you that there was no SANTY-CLAUS!!!

Seeing a ""HERB FROM THE BURB"" like you get upset made my day...

Life is good."
5PSNL1qE6VY,YES!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I saw this movie at a special screening last night. I was naturally skeptical going in, as I do not prefer effect-heavy films usually. This movie was a nice surprise. Everything was fluid and seemingly real. The film is obviously long, running approximately 2 1/2 hours, but the time goes by quickly. It's Cameron's best film besides Terminator 2. The political commentary is rather ''in your face,'' but if you go into it with the mind of having fun, you won't be disappointed. 4/5"
5PSNL1qE6VY,A movie thats like watching someone play video games
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Do you complain for the sake of complaining?  And gripe for the sake of griping?  you may identify yourself with both, but both will lead you to a wasted life full of disappointment.  
Enjoy the shallow entertainment(of griping) while it lasts I suppose, but if you dont curb it, before you know it, its all you will know.

Lifes good"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Preordered my Imax 3D tickets for tonights show at 12:01 am. =D CGI is going to be sick!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Great 3D, but this is fantasy and unrealistic. War today:
Surround the village, drop napalm, kill everthing that tries to flee. To be safe, drop several Neutron bombs. The Newtron bombs was developed in the '80s. Everything living is killed, buildings are not damaged. Since man traveled to another planet, they should be able to us weapons developed in the '60s and '80s. Nice CGI and fantasy movie."
5PSNL1qE6VY,i think it's going to be the best movie ever
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Dude, this is NOTHING like water world. where did you get that idea?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"What SHITTY story-writing by Cameron!!!

Look, the air is supposed to be TOXIC, so the soldiers wear air-masks w/out ""BODY SUITS???""

HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't your SKIN absorb oxygen too???

If not, then why do HUMANS wear chemical suits when dealing with TOXIC SPILLS both liquid & airborne???

And WHY do The N'avi have 10 toes and 8fingers???

And I STILL wanna know why a FUTURE MARINE is riding around in a 17TH CENTURY WHEEL-CHAIR???"
5PSNL1qE6VY,kagaroo jack was a pretty good movie imo...
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Hey scotland2019, I agree with your point...

I'm ALSO trying to point out the inconsistensies in the movie, but some people insist that I'm ""ranting""...

Let's see...CGI or a ""believable plot""...

I'll take the latter, THANK-YOU...."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I don't know what's a BIGGER COP-OUT, your LAME excuse, or Cameron's LAZY-ASS writing...

I guess the CGI is supposed to compensate for SKETCHY-WRITING???

You know, for ALL the money this movie cost to make, how's about it at LEAST make sense???

So, you mean to tell me that ALL-TERRAIN- POWER-CHAIRS won't exist in the future, ""MARGIN???""

Hell, we have ALL-TERRAIN 4-wheeled MTB for the handicapped today..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Aw, c'mon people!!!

You mean to tell me that future technology can tap into a person's mind, clone alien/human hybrids, AND travel light-years through space, BUT CAN'T CURE SIMPLE PARALYSIS??? 

The V.A. of the future must be FUCKING-OVER the war-vets like they're doing  today!

And why do they need human-powered ""amp-suits?"" 

We have remote-controlled, predator drones now, so why don't they have remote-controlled, patrol/sentry robots in the future?

Sounds like LAZY-ASS writing..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Wait a minute...You mean to tell me that in the future, there's no CURE for spinal-cord injuries???

And why is this marine toolin' around in a FUCKING 19th century WHEELCHAIR???

And how is it that the ALIENS speak PERFECT FUCKIN' ENGLISH???"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"@TheNeophyte13 Of course, but the important thing is the second adjective there: majority, which means power. Being white means having the privilege of power, and that means the expectation that anything done in the name of that power is unquestionable. It also means getting upset when others (not born into privilege) are critical of that power."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"It's from the movie "" The Island "" it's called "" My Name is Lincoln ""..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"doesnt look gay!!
it is futuristic movie!!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Saw it last night in 3D and just watching the trailer makes me want to see it again  : )

5PSNL1qE6VY,"just shut up damn sucker........

5PSNL1qE6VY,"Money Doesn't make the movie good, look at District 9. 

The writter and director make it good, so you're half right. :P"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I've seen it yesterday evening!!! 3D version. Guys, you should not miss it. The 3D version!! It's amazing!!! All the audiances gave it a loud applaud at the end of the ""SHOW"", first time in my whole life!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"look awesome ,i got my ticket already."
5PSNL1qE6VY,whats the song at the beggining
5PSNL1qE6VY,whats the name of the song at the beggining
5PSNL1qE6VY,"hey whats the name of the songs at 1:06, 1:46, 2:15, and 2:50?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Is it just me or do these look just like the blue natives from Uncharted 2?
5PSNL1qE6VY,@RockstarDude13 thats avatar airbender
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Looks more like it's critical of corporate colonization of indigenous peoples. Racist only in the sense that the white people in the movie are the racists and they look bad for wanting to exploit the ""other"" race."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"this looks good, this movie will not embarass itself the way Transformers, GI Joe did."
5PSNL1qE6VY,uhh thats avatar THE AIRBENDER
5PSNL1qE6VY,LMAO your kidding me right?!
5PSNL1qE6VY,wow can't wait to see this movie.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Look's cool!!!! Oh and it said on the TV, PG13."
5PSNL1qE6VY,just been to see new avatar movie omg!!!! the best film you will ever see the affects are mind blowing and the 3d is amazing ! !!!!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,just signifies the ignorance and arrogance of the white man. And that is sad cause im white!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"So what age group is this movie for? 
And this movie isnt about that lame avatar anime series on nick?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,too awesome to describe
5PSNL1qE6VY,"@CancunTraveller 
well...its not like james cameron  came up with this idea all by himself"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I know, it looks too much like it, so it gets me confused."
5PSNL1qE6VY,amazing!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Why does the ""AVATAR"" sign look so familiar..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,that movie is going to be crazy.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"WOAH, Cameron sure knows his stuff! :D
Hey, does anyone know if the sound track in this trailer has a name? If so, what is it? Sounds real epic!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"the aliens are called nabi, not avatars, the body jake sully uses is an ""avatar"""
5PSNL1qE6VY,ya its awesome i like it but i cant wait till 2012 not the movie the year that is when a halo movie comes out
5PSNL1qE6VY,*Goes off and cries*
5PSNL1qE6VY,I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS!!! The avatar people are soooooo cute! XD
5PSNL1qE6VY,Dance with smurfs
5PSNL1qE6VY,Isn't this just a crazier version of Pocahontas???
5PSNL1qE6VY,"This movie has been in production for years. Whether it's 12 or 14, I'm not sure, but far longer than Borderlands regardless. Not to discredit that great game, but it didn't come up with the name Pandora. It's practically ancient."
5PSNL1qE6VY,it came out today in singapore
5PSNL1qE6VY,looks extremely lame.
5PSNL1qE6VY,OMG THIS MOVIE WAS AMZZZZIIIING IN 3D
5PSNL1qE6VY,MUST   SEE   !
5PSNL1qE6VY,hmm i never knew that
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Absolutely brother....why the HELL do people seem to have this relentless tendency to either side with one extreme or the other?!!! As human beings, we are both good and evil!!!!! People, please get this in your heads!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,He was in Terminator Salvation. not a amazing film but he kicked ass in it
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Люди, это лучший фильм на свете! Man, it the best movie in the world!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Eeh... I'l wait till it hits the dollar theatre! LOL
5PSNL1qE6VY,Looks like an expensive piece of sci-fi junk. I'd rather watch Transformers 2 then this....it looks THAT bad
5PSNL1qE6VY,This is the first time i seen this extended verson of the preveiws on this show. This looks hella bomb mang!
5PSNL1qE6VY,By far one of my favorite directors. Trailer looks awesome. Great job James! Going to be another Pride Possession to your resume.
5PSNL1qE6VY,This movie is gonna be sweet.
5PSNL1qE6VY,another movie to show how much the human race is dangerous.
5PSNL1qE6VY,wat dude this isnt event the last airbender man this is a totally different story dude the movie is called the last airbender not avatar i thought the same at first but its not
5PSNL1qE6VY,Yeah I know... that's gonna ruin the whole movie right? pfft nonsense
5PSNL1qE6VY,Im off to watch it tnite in an advanced 3D screening can't wait but B4 I do im gonna make sure iv'e smoked a massive spliff and im on the front row!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Why the name Avatar? It's nothing close to the best american animation series ""AVATAR"". PFT! Looks awesome though... but why the title??!!!!??!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Can't wait to see it!, looks great"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"It's gonna be amazing, but lets just hope when James Cameron receives the Ocsar for best picture he doesn't say ""I'm King of the World!!!"" again."
5PSNL1qE6VY,I will be at the Red Carpet premier tomorrow the 16th! I won two tickets! At  the Chinese Theater in Hollywood! SWEET!
5PSNL1qE6VY,i'm so on board for this... some timeless tales need retelling... & reminding us.
5PSNL1qE6VY,ooooh thank u we dont really need your opinion
5PSNL1qE6VY,"another shitty movie
yes, I'm bullshitting a movie before I see it."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"No.
That is another movie that's going to come out soon called ""The Last Airbender""."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"ok but still the men have guns  and freaking robots and blue alien things have spears 4 leg creatures and dragons now lets see the chart

        Marines   ]    Aliens

Marines:they have anti air guns thats good for dragons rifles snipers mg's robots gunships more ships and grenades                           ok now lets look at the aliens  they have spears four leg creatures and dragons 


now do u thing 4 leg creatures would stop the army im just trying to make a point there"
5PSNL1qE6VY,is this about that show on nick?
5PSNL1qE6VY,"i want to watch this Movie Avatar cant wait this friday 1st show only 5.75 dollars.
yes yes yoooo!!!
SUPERB!!!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Agreed. With this movie I don't think there will be an ""its ok"" or ""its alright"". Its gotta be great or horrible. One or the other.

My money is going towards it being GREAT!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"yeah, but hopefully we aren't so cruel to the population."
5PSNL1qE6VY,it would be fucking sick if 100 years from now humans find a planet as amazing as pandora
5PSNL1qE6VY,this looks amazing!!!!!  now i HAVE to watch it X)
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Thats part of the plot. The blue elf people are very primative, but more advanced when it comes to combat. So the humans are forced to go in undercover.

its makes for a better movie."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"When you hit the reply button, your reply is sent to there inbox. So Radlations knows you are replying to his comment. 

This isn't twitter, no need for @soandso."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I give it a fifty-fifty chance, it seems like it'll be either really good...

Or really, really bad."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"You are correct. theres going to be a lot of CG, but James Camerons goal with the CG was to use it in away where it blends with reality and reality blends with it. . Where you can't tell the difference between the CG and whats real. 

This movie also wasn't recorded with any normal 3D camera. The CG and 3D cameras used have all been in production sinse a little after tittanic. Two cameras side by side pointed at the same target. Both images are sent to a computer and is made into one image."
5PSNL1qE6VY,why couldn't they just attack them instead of turning them in to those ugly alien blue things!im not trying to be mean but thats what the real army would do
5PSNL1qE6VY,if you dont like it dont watch it
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Sam Worthington has become one of my favorite actors since I first saw his acting as Marcus Wright in Terminator Salvation. He didn't seem very popular before that. This movie looks awesome and I'm sure his acting should be just as great if not better than before!

Already have by tickets for opening night!!!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I agree, though take a look back in history... Native Americans...""Savages"" ring a bell...  I for one am more than pumped to see a movie that had a 300,000,000 budget. Though it's almost an excerpt from Native Americans. Seriously"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"no, I don't think so."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Good I'm glad people are making movies like this. More than 97% of native american ""prisoners"" when ""rescued"" by white settlers either went back to the tribes or wished they had. Children ""Prisoners"" cried and screamed and wanted to stay, the natives would give very few back, and if they did they'd stay in touch. Native women who bore half white children were looked at the same as any full blood to the tribe, but the whites didn't bother going back for those kids because they were half breeds."
5PSNL1qE6VY,i hear the movie is almost costing $500 million dollars. ya you read right. 500 million dollars. terminator cost 100 million dollars in CG and titanic cost 200 million. imagine this movie. probably 80% is CG
5PSNL1qE6VY,"The ""BEST"" movie of 2009 BY FAR."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Obviously the answer is not ! We can not watch a movie without relating it with the real world
5PSNL1qE6VY,was this whole movie done in CG only?
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I, for one, am sick of everyone trying to relate every movie to something in the real world. If you see a connection between this movie and, say, a current issue, different movie, etc., that's all good and fine, but the people who say that any movie that just looks as straight-up-good or is as big as Avatar HAS to represent something else need to shut up.

It's a movie. It's not meant to piss people off because of potential allusions to the real world. Can't we just enjoy it for what it's worth?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,I thought this was Avatar the air bender.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Looks good, totally watching it. Love, Sigourney Weaver!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"hey screw you, i went ot an early preview of this movie in eastern europe and it was 7/10 best!

check my imdb username ""jaquoii"", im a very respected person there, so check my reviews too!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"HAHAHAHAHA, of course i know who the fuck Christian Bale is, and Sam Worthington, the bricky from Perth, AUSTRALIA!!! i wrote this to attract peaple like you, noob, this movie which is guna be the best freaking movie EVER concidering its $300 Million.. made by James Cameron!!!! seriously."
5PSNL1qE6VY,link is a scam
5PSNL1qE6VY,"""dances with wolfes"" in space. cameron must hae lost his mind..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Who the hell is Christian Bale?, are these new actors."
5PSNL1qE6VY,This movie should be very good that after we all watch it they should make the second one.
5PSNL1qE6VY,Hahahaha... That storyline is good every time i guess.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I just did the math. At 230 million to make and 161 minutes long = 23,809 dollars a second for continuous eye orgasms."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"It´s no Last Samurai... It´s not Dances with wolves...
¡¡¡¡¡ IT´S POCAHONTAS!!!!!!!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"He's name is Marcus (in Terminator Salvation)

I can't wait  for Avatar:)
What is the title of the song from 1:06?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Have you watched Terminator: Salvation? He is the guy who saves Christian Bale's character. The cyborg type guy(can't remember the name XD)
5PSNL1qE6VY,"If James Cameron's name wasn't attached to this movie, no one would give a shit."
5PSNL1qE6VY,I was JUST gonna say that! Totally Last Samurai!  Good call man
5PSNL1qE6VY,This cost $300 million???
5PSNL1qE6VY,"This is the new Matrix...what Matrix did for cinema years ago, this does today.  Also, it has political, religious, and philosophical themes which are very much like today's oil game."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Same plot as Last Samurai, and Dances with Wolves I bet.

Just WAY more money.

Still gonna see it."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Yea sounds like Oil in Irac not trying to kill people just need couple barrels of oil
5PSNL1qE6VY,lmao
5PSNL1qE6VY,who the fuck is Sam Worthington!!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Smurfs

This looks like a little kids movie."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Small Pox you fucking idiot.
5PSNL1qE6VY,This is our land~!!!cool man~!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"My Professor said that this movie is the most expensive so far, either that, or 2nd after ""Titanic"""
5PSNL1qE6VY,Looks epic. Music gives m e chills.
5PSNL1qE6VY,what is the music that is playing from 1:06
5PSNL1qE6VY,I like Cameron but this movie is going to bug.. i mean its a really obvious and heavy handed message movie blegh
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I'm not really into SciFi but this looks kinda cool, the critics are loving it and I've never seen a live action 3D movie before..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"It's called 'My Name is Lincoln' from the movie The Island, and it was also used in the Elizabeth: The Golden Age trailer. I couldn't find it on iTunes, but I got it a year or so back through *coughlimewirecough*. 

It's a beautiful song but I don't really think it fits this trailer..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,lol...
5PSNL1qE6VY,"alex he has nothing against the marines, it's just a movie! lol"
5PSNL1qE6VY,How about instead of this is our land he says THIS IS SPAAAARTAAA!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,wtf does james cameron have against the marines?
5PSNL1qE6VY,"WTF is this ? Next alien ?? or StarCraft ??
Terran VS Protoss ??"
5PSNL1qE6VY,PEOPLE the things is that these manipulating movies ae not from no where to now here but they actually have undergrund bases in USA where they manipulate human geines with other creatures and they clone and do whatever comes on their minds.  so this is just a glimps of what they have been do from the past 60 years
5PSNL1qE6VY,hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...I guess we have another muhammid ali here! You make me crack up DjGodzz!! lol
5PSNL1qE6VY,looks amazing !
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I've read the story and it is fairly similar.  ""Call Me Joe"" is a phenomenal story and it was the first thing I though of when I saw the Avatar trailer."
5PSNL1qE6VY,it looks like a good film....Its got a nice review.But U have to watch to know.....
5PSNL1qE6VY,Really man...really!?!? You are really trying to start a fight and talk shit online!?!? wow DjGodzz either you're a little kid(I would understand then) or you need to grow the hell up!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Quelle musique, sublime. Les personnages sont magnifiques, je ne manquerait pas sa sortie au cinéma."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"You are color blind--those people are blue.   I'm not going blue, green, or pinko."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I'd think its because they are using the same producer, and he liked the music.

But i haven't gone to the movies in 2-3 years so..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Not sure if you where correcting someone or not,  but...correctly it would be: this is ""our"" land ""dumbass"". There you go, now it's spelled correctly! haha"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"the maker of Terminator 1 and 2 made this, it should be very good."
5PSNL1qE6VY,what is song in min. 2:17??
5PSNL1qE6VY,hmmm... that looks like a EPIC WIN!
5PSNL1qE6VY,umm...looks like a video game...not good graphics for a movie...expected much better from james cameron.
5PSNL1qE6VY,at 3:14 that this is sparta!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"WOW i mean 
WOW, UNBELIEVABLE, i'm looking forward to this spectacular movie :D"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Its just got the day of the day after tomorrow feel about it great effects predictable script and fancy actors with the look but not the tallent.....very unbelievable but it will make a fortune for sure
5PSNL1qE6VY,":lol What if the natives looked like the aliens in the movie Aliens...and they wanted to follow the Marines home, to feed on the population of earth....   Would the Marine still turn on his own 
fellow grunts?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,that doesnt make sence but GOOD LUCK
5PSNL1qE6VY,Humans are so ruthless..
5PSNL1qE6VY,"i never looked into this. when i heard avatar, i thought it was the airbender movie so i was like wtf, why are they changing the story with blue ppl!? but then my friend said this movie was like groundbreaking in the movie industry or something and i was like wtf?! isnt it the airbender and he said no... and now i wanna see IT"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"90% on Rotten Tomatoes 
and Ebert gave it a 4/4"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"this looks bloody amazing, i cant wait till it comes out on thursday been wanting to see it for like decades x)"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Forget everything you've heard about Avatar when you go see it.
5PSNL1qE6VY,this movie looks fuckn tight
5PSNL1qE6VY,are you pathetically trying to say its rascist because it has not 1 black person thats just sad its rascist to point out such things as im sure the black majority dont care what colour they are just ppl like you who make everythn rascist
5PSNL1qE6VY,Ground-breaking cgi my ass. This looks pretty boring.
5PSNL1qE6VY,fuck i wat to see it man
5PSNL1qE6VY,"yes^^ look at youtube ""The island My Name is Lincoln"""
5PSNL1qE6VY,"yeah it was written for the movie ""the island"" it was used the Elizabeth as well! 

when the movie is about fighting for something you believe in..this is the authority when it comes to soundtrack"
5PSNL1qE6VY,a) no black peeple in this movie   b) relevant to current events in Iraq c) michelle rodriguez is yet another gun-shooter tuff chick d) they show TOO MUCH of the plot in this trlr e) how can humans not d-feet tribal species   but im going to see it anyway!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"From the Movie ""The Island!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"first reviews are doing good.
I have booked 2 tickets at nearest imax... my gf is thrilled!

P.S.@ deathtrapdeath : WATCH the roads dude. a tree might fall on you"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"they spend 500 bilion for this film 
i am sure Avatar will beat Titanic !"
5PSNL1qE6VY,It looks the typical predictable american style movie to me...let me guess the hero wins against all odds saves the day and they all live hapily ever after...maybe one of them dies but not before you have the emotional last tearjerking speech.... james bond in space in space
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Yep, it sure looks like more thinly veiled liberal propaganda. But it has been the norm for so long now I'm used to it. I will see this just because Cameron has made some of my all time favourite movies, so I'm sure I will enjoy it despite the agenda it is pushing..."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Awesome...definitely have to see it!  WETA Digital is also working on The Hobbit I think.  I can't wait to see their rendition of Smaug the Dragon.
5PSNL1qE6VY,man wtf?? did the trailer just give the whole movie...... that there ends up being a war and that the aleins will come up out of no where with a huge army and beat the humans... WTF!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Wrong movie, bro."
5PSNL1qE6VY,The Colonial Marines have been busy.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Oh no, not more cgi laden crap...geez..! Gone are the days when things could be believeable. Real actors doing real things..not all this computer generate superhuman crap. Aliens was fantastic but this...I ain't gonna waste my pennies seeing. Looks rubbish."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Why didn't you like Titanic? I mean I'm not saying I'm a big fan of it or anything, I have some problems with it myself, I'm just asking what your own reasons are."
5PSNL1qE6VY,*Shakes head* Not good. In so many ways.
5PSNL1qE6VY,but the movie is of fox
5PSNL1qE6VY,looks awsome.............! Divine creation lol
5PSNL1qE6VY,i need to see this...
5PSNL1qE6VY,reminds me of halo...so freakin' sweet...i love the beggining of the trailer...
5PSNL1qE6VY,I don't know... I don't thik this movie is going to be as good as all the people expect...
5PSNL1qE6VY,Another waste of money to promote US foreign policy. What a load of shite. James Cameron this ones a doozy!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Movie finally premiered last night in London, and ended with the audience in claps and cheers. First reviews can attest to that. Pretty much all of 'em agree that it's a complete spectacle and that the King (as in, James Cameron) is indeed back. All I can say from that is the following: SUCK IT, HATERS!!!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Typical Americans - find a peaceful place and destroy it with money orientated means.
5PSNL1qE6VY,Looks like a good movie. The anaology with the treatment of the Native Americans in the United States; the Aborigines in Australia or just about any indigenous people who stand in the way of 'economic progress' is pretty clear and I hope that people who see this movie understand the link.
5PSNL1qE6VY,looks good
5PSNL1qE6VY,"THE NAVI CONCEPT IS SO NOT-ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!
(who played FFX or FFX-2 wil understand)"
5PSNL1qE6VY,then start from yourself.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"earlsfav, people have the right to have their own opinions even if they don't agree with yours. 
I don't see anything mind blowing about it......conquest of the Amazons but in another planet.  I sure hope that the film is far better than the trailer."
5PSNL1qE6VY,This is one of the movies where its politically incorrect to say anything about them.  All I see is humans fighting blue people in an Amazon like planet. In the end the good guys win. End of story.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I still dont get the fuss...the Avatar beings look cartoonish...something out of Star Wars.
The only thing worth seeing IMO is the landscapes and the background."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Does anyone know the name of the song playing at the beginning of the trailer?
5PSNL1qE6VY,Avatar: The best mix of Live Action and Cartoon Animation since Rodger Rabbit.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"avatar has 100% on rotten tomatoes so far 
 yikes!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"The visuals are so colorfull and vivid, normally i dont care much for effects but this is a must see on the big screen."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"im seeing this for my birthday, awl. :D"
5PSNL1qE6VY,LOL DANCES WITH SMURFS.
5PSNL1qE6VY,this is like a playstation game without the controllers.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"lmao. good call. 


its Kimari!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,I can't wait to see it. I have a real aliens feel for it already
5PSNL1qE6VY,I have a lot of confidence in Cameron and his team. I hope this one is full of fresh effects and action scenes. Looks like he has a chance to do some stuff with the eco message and maybe some transhumanism stuff. I think it'll do well
5PSNL1qE6VY,ur stupid this is one of the most expensive movies made. thieve spent so much money on this spent so much time making it so if you dont like it than dont watch videos of and dont comment on it.
5PSNL1qE6VY,looks like a great movie
5PSNL1qE6VY,lmao we could only wish
5PSNL1qE6VY,@LCash523 lets start with you!
5PSNL1qE6VY,@ElPandaDeLaAccion like 14 bucks
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Dude I posted several videos on this subject and there is a book, website pandorapedia . org that explains all this. Don't assume you know more than a guy that is on NASA's advisory board."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Cameron...?Did you copy the Navi look from FFX(ronso tribe)XD
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Looks beautiful. Dialogue, however, sounds laughable, almost like a parody."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"eghm ... Your spear in shorts, yeah?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,I can't wait to go and watch this in 3D with my blue painted face while I sit in my shorts with my trusty spear!
5PSNL1qE6VY,ive got 2 c this in 3D
5PSNL1qE6VY,@oftino unless humanity betrays the very thing that makes us human :)
5PSNL1qE6VY,Sublime
5PSNL1qE6VY,Leave the noble smurfs alone!!!! (anyone watching south park will get it)
5PSNL1qE6VY,it makes me think about 1492
5PSNL1qE6VY,Luv the previews. I'll watch it and buy the DVD.
5PSNL1qE6VY,great movie
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Imagine if China with so much people start to take over other countries.  Those countries would fight to the death to defend it.  U.S.A will defend its territories and countries from hostile take overs.  If Russia said we have 10 trillion dollars for Alaska to buy it back since you're already in debt, would it sell out?  Typical strong countries taking over other countries who know nothing about guns and bullets or bombs."
5PSNL1qE6VY,yay - SIGOURNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,Soooo this film is Dances with Wolves set in the future and the native americans are blue
5PSNL1qE6VY,You're such an idiot. The movie is protrayed as soldiers invading someone's homeland and telling them to get lost so we can take it. Wouldn't you be pissed and hateful to them if they were destroying your home. Besides he got his legs with the avatar and as you can see he fights with them.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Why do the Avatar people hate the Americans? They are just trying to bring them into the 21st Century. They are trying to get that soldiers legs back, that was the deal. So let them, why not?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Let me guess......humans,military and indstry are the bad-guy?.......wow what a tired movie line.........."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Pocahontas..?
5PSNL1qE6VY,blues clues the movie
5PSNL1qE6VY,Great looking movie
5PSNL1qE6VY,It's a film with a battle which I was waiting for.
5PSNL1qE6VY,I'm waiting for this movie to come out!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,great movie
5PSNL1qE6VY,yea wierd isin't it....  who would take land from people who were already there?
5PSNL1qE6VY,at 3:11 i thought he was going to say THIS IS SPARTA!
5PSNL1qE6VY,Yes right :P
5PSNL1qE6VY,@hans030858 damn...chill the fuck out...unless you're kidding
5PSNL1qE6VY,how come i thought abt native americans and europeans while watching this trailer?
5PSNL1qE6VY,"jajajaj, xo esta paranoia mola"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Hmm.  Space Indians.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"watch?v=K8ThbpFW5aw

my assumptive review"
5PSNL1qE6VY,THIS LOOKS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE!!! I get shivers everytime i watch it and tears in my eyes!
5PSNL1qE6VY,love this movie
5PSNL1qE6VY,Racist!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,can someone say rendition of Pocahontas?
5PSNL1qE6VY,haha before I saw the trailer I thought it was about the Last Airbender too!
5PSNL1qE6VY,white man always trying to steal  something
5PSNL1qE6VY,Someone tell me the name of the trailer music?
5PSNL1qE6VY,kill all those blue freaks and take their land
5PSNL1qE6VY,Oh noooo! What have we become!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Well what do you expect, its an American movie! and were not in Kansas anymore is a classic saying! thats why they said it! just fucking deal with it! its a movie, a good movie! and give me one good example of propaganda in this movie

and states!?! don't you mean the only country!?!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"its james cameron
hes a revolutioner"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"The special effects are good
Let's see if the movie and the story are that good"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Yup this has pretty much the same idea but D9 had less ""bling"", propaganda and massive battles which was a good change IMO. Let's just hope that this is as cool : )"
5PSNL1qE6VY,lool music by steve jablonsky???
5PSNL1qE6VY,looks kinda like district nine?
5PSNL1qE6VY,sounds like every game from a movie.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"i cant wait to c this
my video production class will be taking a field trip on december 18 opening day to the movie theater to c this movie and i cant wait
after watchin the trailer cant wait
i will be missing 4 of my classes to c this so YAY!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,so what? most games based on movies get low ratings. Doesn't mean that this movie will suck because the game did.
5PSNL1qE6VY,lmfao. classic.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"it has a game in demo not released yet, youtube it"
5PSNL1qE6VY,why would any one list true lies as one of they're works?
5PSNL1qE6VY,"""Revenge of the Smurfs"""
5PSNL1qE6VY,the beginning seems almost exactly the same as the new star trek and the star wars movies...lol
5PSNL1qE6VY,coool!
5PSNL1qE6VY,cool if look
5PSNL1qE6VY,This looks so amazing.
5PSNL1qE6VY,and the your going to watch it and say its an awesome movie.. cause you just love bein against everyone.. face it i bet your going to watch it
5PSNL1qE6VY,wow Zumzammim. its just a movie. your prolly a poor black kid that everyone picked on and never liked. its just a movie. get a life and a job loser!
5PSNL1qE6VY,that is just call the last airbender it comes out next year
5PSNL1qE6VY,"that is coming out next year, this is totally different film. its by Cameron who made so many great films
this movie is a must see, not that cartoon show"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"@ 3:13 should be "" that.. This IS SPARTAAA"""
5PSNL1qE6VY,I don't think I've ever been so excited about an upcoming movie.
5PSNL1qE6VY,Beutifull colors is going to look great on blueray.
5PSNL1qE6VY,pg13 i think
5PSNL1qE6VY,wut rate is it?
5PSNL1qE6VY,I will try to be optimistic. Titanic trailer was also a dud.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I'll pass on this...being a Cameron fan, I am disappointed by the overuse of CGI...it looks like a video game!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,Kinda has a Pocahontas feel to it
5PSNL1qE6VY,I have chills.
5PSNL1qE6VY,Lets get real gunships vs anykinde of monsters will always win .... fake  fake and very fake even 4 a SF
5PSNL1qE6VY,This movie gonna be a bomb!!! Just magical!!! Somehow I'm speechless after watching this trailer and it doesn't stop! :)
5PSNL1qE6VY,"no it has nothing to do with the tv series
its was written by Cameron in 1995 and now finally being made"
5PSNL1qE6VY,oh ok just making sure
5PSNL1qE6VY,FAILD
5PSNL1qE6VY,wow! this is looks like a starcraft to me....
5PSNL1qE6VY,"man i cant wait for it! ive already atched the tralier like 5 times. it looks really good. i someone help me out, has it got anything to do with the tv series?"
5PSNL1qE6VY,More Like FernGully
5PSNL1qE6VY,Ferngully With a CG makeover
5PSNL1qE6VY,14 years is a long time to make a great story. ive been waiting for this for months :)
5PSNL1qE6VY,"but GI Joe is total crap, i turned it off on my bluray player"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"dude shut the fuck up. dont judge the movie unless you actually see it. unless you have, go fuck off, as ButtErBaLL619 said"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"it look good, don't try to pock holes in it until you see it"
5PSNL1qE6VY,is so cool
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I wish I could be more positive, but it just does not look that special to me. Damn. This is the problem when expectations get raised too high."
5PSNL1qE6VY,OMG!!.... is even better than I expected....8D
5PSNL1qE6VY,"GI Joe? wtf? its more like Aliens 
come on now lol"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"yea i know, im saying just for the movie, and on 60 Minutes Cameron was on and they said it was $400+ all together not 500"
5PSNL1qE6VY,lolwut
5PSNL1qE6VY,Looks like a computer game because you are not seeing it as its meant to be seen in 3D. Just wait. It's visually stunning in a way that no film has ever been.
5PSNL1qE6VY,Yeah based on a real True story
5PSNL1qE6VY,fantastic technology but why create a film that looks like a computer game crossed with a crap army story...waste of money and time
5PSNL1qE6VY,lookin good
5PSNL1qE6VY,well its not gonna bomb...Your gonna be pretty disapointed...The best movie right here.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"i saw 15 mins of this in IMAX 3D and it was pretty damn good
i cant wait for this :D"
5PSNL1qE6VY,watching this trailer in the cinema gave me massive goosebumps
5PSNL1qE6VY,SENSATIONAL!!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"@sinterdesint anytime, if you go to SuperheroHype forums, you can get the latest info on the movie. im on there with the same username"
5PSNL1qE6VY,allright well thanks for clearing that up
5PSNL1qE6VY,@sinterdesint lol they didnt corrected it. Cameron said its around 250 - 300 million like a week ago
5PSNL1qE6VY,@ELMER832007 dude i went to see the free screening in IMAX. i got to see 15 mins of the movie and it looks freaking amazing PERIOD.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"new york times said it was 500, I dont know where you have gotten your information?

Nice to hear that it looks incredible"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"@sinterdesint nope that was incorrect, the actual number is 250-300 million and its doesnt look like a video game, trust me ive seen 15 mins of this in 3D and it looks just incredible."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"I read that its 500, or close to"
5PSNL1qE6VY,@sinterdesint its 250 million not 500
5PSNL1qE6VY,"looks like a videogame to me, is this what 500 million looks like??"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"and they cant cill those creatures with their bows? but hey, its a movie"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"what the music in the beginning, I know it's from Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age"
5PSNL1qE6VY,they can send an army to another fucking planet in another solar system but they cant fucking make him walk again?
5PSNL1qE6VY,That looks really cool.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"you can tell a filmakers' drug of choice by their work. 
this has everything; furries; loose moral ""values"", anti-capitalist parallels, action, loud music, cgi. = cameron is a ganja man. how else would he have the confidence to finish this monstrosity."
5PSNL1qE6VY,@Ynotnoswad nav'ii?
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Has anyone modded a Sim for sims2 of the Nobie, yet?  This movie is the Sci-Fi version of Dances With Wolves, both showing that technology and greed can cause harm."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Has anyone made a Sim of these things yet? The Nobi look like they would be so cool to play as!
5PSNL1qE6VY,*Goosebumps* i am SO watching this!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Usually when I watch even a good movie trailer, it's potency starts to fade with every succeeding  viewing.  But with this trailer which was good when I first saw it, it seems to get even better and better.  Come on December 18!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"o man ! 
this is going to be good"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"omg, yeah!  dances with wolves is almost the same thing!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,omg they look like  protoss from starcraft
5PSNL1qE6VY,im about to see this movie baked as shit
5PSNL1qE6VY,"looks awesome!
but i kinda get the feeling its a cross between halo and pocahontas"
5PSNL1qE6VY,its the same music they used for Elizabeth: the golden age trailer with cate blanchett
5PSNL1qE6VY,I am pitching my tent waiting to see this movie!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,anyone knows what song is that that starts at 0:30??
5PSNL1qE6VY,"cool. reminds me of that movie ""Dances with the Smurfs"""
5PSNL1qE6VY,The Europeans killed 85% of the native americans because of the diseases and sickness they possessed.  IT wasn't a full on war/battle.
5PSNL1qE6VY,"nav'i, not nabi :)"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"yea the music in the film is james horner, but the start of this trailer is from taken from the island, trailers often take other films music"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"the song is from the soundtrack to 'the island' steve jablonsky. amazing looking film, cant wait!!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"It isn't, it's a completely different thing."
5PSNL1qE6VY,i don't think that this is based on the cartoon
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Not only the Native Americans but the Austrian Aborignes, Japanese-""Ainu"" and other Native races. Well this movie is pretty much 1996's Indenpence Day in REVERSE."
5PSNL1qE6VY,i bet the native americans wished they could hav kicked the europeans asses like these natives of pandora are did....
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Avatar is a different movie.

I think you are looking for the movie called "" The last airbender"""
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Actually, the song is My Name is Lincoln, written by Steve Jablonsky, heard on The Island. He also wrote the score for Gears of War and Transformers."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Signourney Weaver? Well, shes always been good in space/alien movies.."
5PSNL1qE6VY,OMG the special effects look like a video game!!!  They really should have just made the whole fucking thing animated.
5PSNL1qE6VY,another godam movie that portrays Americans as some kind of jerks. Propaganda films
5PSNL1qE6VY,hang was that one woman in Resident evil?
5PSNL1qE6VY,is it th humans?or the creatures?
5PSNL1qE6VY,Come on u guys. Its us lol. Humans. If ur sitting on a recourse thats worth 20million a kilo. Ur damn well bet thier going to be moved lol. I hope the humans win. I always rute for the bad guys lol.
5PSNL1qE6VY,what are the names of the songs they used for the trailer?
5PSNL1qE6VY,pause it at any second and it looks good and unique
5PSNL1qE6VY,sooooo wanna see it i bet it will still looks amazing in 2-D
5PSNL1qE6VY,"dances with smurfs was epic win, this is gonna be great"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"at first i thought this was gunna bee super gay 
but now it looks pretty kewl"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Tell your mom to lower her rates.....  And on another note, write this garbage somewhere else."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Everytime I see this trailer it makes me want to see the movie even more!  Come on December 18, come on!"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"in order to win againts the superior might of u.s military, the na'vi can learn from the strategy of ewoks.. them ewoks are bad asses."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"see the helicopper??
It look like the halo's one or the starcraft""s one"
5PSNL1qE6VY,lol south park made a little parody of this with smurfs
5PSNL1qE6VY,"If I wanted to be a part of an interactive animated experience, I'd by an X-Box."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Lol u make that sound like its an outlandish idea. Hell, we went to WAR over sludge. In Africa thousands of people die daily over Valuable ""rocks""."
5PSNL1qE6VY,It's not what the story's about it's about how it's told. Roger Ebert said something like that. And it holds true. James Cameron hasn't failed in career w/ his films. So hopefully this works too.
5PSNL1qE6VY,this? this is SPARTA
5PSNL1qE6VY,who's the bad guys in this movie?
5PSNL1qE6VY,3:09  But we will send them a message: THIS IS SPARTA!
5PSNL1qE6VY,how to exterminate the tribes? send that chick from alien at 1:04 in with a flame thrower and she'll kick all their asses...
5PSNL1qE6VY,wow it actually looks GOOD
5PSNL1qE6VY,Good luck Cameron - a lot of Hollywood's money is riding on this one!
5PSNL1qE6VY,That statement shows your intellect.  Who cares about plots.  Just look at the 'pretty'  oooooh!  moron.
5PSNL1qE6VY,weird but looks like a good movie kinda gave me goosebumps
5PSNL1qE6VY,omg this looks pwnage...
5PSNL1qE6VY,Michelle Rodriguez is female???
5PSNL1qE6VY,its called science fiction has no relavance to modern day  military with diminishing natural reacorces i couldnt see it unlikely in 2000 years or whatever were not all one reacorce hungry dictarorship
5PSNL1qE6VY,"WooW , this movie looks really good . this trailer is way better than the first crappy one."
5PSNL1qE6VY,"ughh what a pathetically predictable lalaland plot.  The 'Marines' just follow orders and are sent by the big bad corporations SOLELY for natural resources.  They never aid natural disaster victims or restore governments from misogynist religious nuts (as they actually do in real life).  

Total slap in the face to our service members...F U Cameron. You get a 'D' for writing a tired played out stereotypical unoriginal plot on this one...lame."
5PSNL1qE6VY,looks like another CGI based movie by Pixar huh
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Hiroshi Ishiguro, for example, develops androids that, for a short period, are indistinguishable from human beings (Ishiguro, 2005). Hiroshi Ishiguro, for example, develops androids that, for a short period, are indistinguishable from human beings (Ishiguro, 2005). His highly anthropomorphic androids struggle with the so-called uncanny valley,"
5PSNL1qE6VY,They do that alot. Like the Dragonheart theme is in every other commercial...
5PSNL1qE6VY,Looks good but really unsure of the blatant political angle -
5PSNL1qE6VY,"Looks pretty cool, but I'm so sick of the same theme ""humans are bad""."
5PSNL1qE6VY,Surely looks promising!
5PSNL1qE6VY,"yeeeahhh,good call :D"
5PSNL1qE6VY,"i think the movie will be very cool. but this trailer  shown to much, they even showed the plot...."
5PSNL1qE6VY,does this remind anyone of pocahontas??
5PSNL1qE6VY,I can hardly wait!  Let's not forget that this is going to be in 3D.  Imagine  being emersed in Pandora in 3D!
5PSNL1qE6VY,Looks awesome!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,THIS      LOOKS        EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5PSNL1qE6VY,What are you talking about? This movie looks masterpiece! James Cameron is very creative.
5PSNL1qE6VY,sucks ass..looks like cameron's got his hea shoved deep in his ass
5PSNL1qE6VY,:DDDDD

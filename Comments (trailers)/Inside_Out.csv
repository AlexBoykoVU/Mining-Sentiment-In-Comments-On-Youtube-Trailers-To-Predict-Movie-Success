yRUAzGQ3nSY,This is gonna be as bad as Herman's Head.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The movie got universal acclaim!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY, Mabe I will like your show ok👎👎😐😒😒
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"If these things control your emotions, then what things control your body? (Arms, lungs, toes, ect...) Or am I thinking too much..."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I have the book
yRUAzGQ3nSY,yolo
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"When listening and looking at the voices inside the Mom's head it looks warm and cozy. Then zoom into the Dad's head and you immediately notice there's more room, the feel is clammy, somewhat cold, and more echo when the voices talk as if the dad's brain is barren.

Interesting attention to detail Pixar! This film has already gotten 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Very excited to see this piece of carefully structured art."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,what determinants the gender of your emotions? is it your gender? because little girl has both in her... that's just sort of odd... or is just random?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Didn't even bother checking this out, but wow, the trailer looks great!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,ON MY BIRTHDAY

yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Keep making theory because I really want to know more about that, keep it up"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Great!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love this movie it shows how stupid women are... classic.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,They forgot someone that is annoyed
yRUAzGQ3nSY,lol mind sports. funny.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Well, it is stereotypical and it's not something people should aspire to but in reality, I know a lot of families think exactly like this."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,omg cant wait!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"If Osmosis Jones is like CSI, Inside Out is like Criminal Minds, minus the adult themes, of course."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,2:16 - Anger looks like George Costanza from Seinfeld.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,So basicly puberty the movie?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"In the uk trailer, the guys are watching soccer ... I'm sorry football"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Wwwwwwowwwwwww

yRUAzGQ3nSY,Riley should have been all like NO
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Hi 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"do 5 emotions really make up the human mind?
Where's Bravery? Kindness? Pride? Love?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,those characters look so weird with that sparkly glitter but it's 3d glitter that looks like hair o_o
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This reminds me of that one timmy turner episode lol
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,awesome imagination and great concept.....
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love it that the dad's joy still looks feminine but with a mustache
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Mmm.. I can smell the popcorn.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I came here from StacyPlays channel..
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I can't what to see the movie
yRUAzGQ3nSY,wow This looks awesome !
yRUAzGQ3nSY,this is adorable
yRUAzGQ3nSY,It worries me the fact that the moms lead emotion is sadness and the dads lead emotion is anger.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,ALERT! DISNEY HAS 301 VIDEOS RUN!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Love it😍😍
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Mom -  Sadness as leader: embraced sadness? / Holding back? / Passive?
Dad  -    Anger as leader: stress? / responsible? / caring? / stubborn?
Riley -     ???:  ???


how do you branch out an emotion into different characteristics?
Internetz Halp!! plz!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,HEYO is that Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion I hear at the end? How fitting
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"So...the mom's Anger and Fear is Female, and the Dad's Anger and Fear is Male, how come their daughter's Anger and Fear is Male and not Female?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,M
yRUAzGQ3nSY,make a hardcore swtor tv show or movie but make it really dark and gritty and have swearing
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Anyone else find it interesting the main or ""leader"" emotion in the mom and dad are sadness and anger respectively while Riley's is joy, apparently?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"0:19 None of the mother's emotions move their mouth to say 'sure did'. The fear, anger, and disgust all just had their mouths closed, and the joy said 'totally'.

Good job Pixar!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,That looks AMAZING. #sokeen
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,what did that pilot say?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"i see a bunch of y'all wondering about why the mom has all female emotions and the dad has all male emotions, but riley has both! if you also notice, the emotions of the mom are all dressed like the mom: same hair, glasses, style etc. same goes for the dad. i'm guessing this is because they've who they are got it all figured out. they know exactly who they are and who they want to be. riley's emotions are completely mismatched. riley's still figuring it out, she has no idea who she really is, what she wants to look like, act like, etc. maybe she's also figuring out her gender as well? just my thoughts!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"The fact I can see 
"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Haha can't wait 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Want to see this!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Hi
"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,why does it say official trailer if its not official?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"When the foot comes down, all negotiations have ended."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I like how each person has diffrent inner decor. The mother's head room has curtians and stuff. The father's is like a sports lounge and the kids' is of course kid themed.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Is there Any emoticón of jalousness???
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I'm NEVER going to see this movie in Theaters or anything, But I like this trailer!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Make a movie about mountain goats.  
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Riley is pretty unlikable.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,OMG THAT MOVE IS THE DAY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY !!!!!!!!! ❤💙💚💛💜💖💗💟👍
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Emotions that have emotions...
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I think my inner Leslie Knope would be on overdrive 24/7 if I had Special Agent Dale Cooper for a father.
yRUAzGQ3nSY, Good job Abraham!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I feel like every dislike on this was by people who hit it by accident whilst trying to give it a like
yRUAzGQ3nSY,i want to see this sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"It is like ""Herman's Head"" The movie. Has anyone mentioned that this was done before. It looks funny and I liked the show, so I'm not ragging on it, just reminding people of the television show that was the same concept."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,why dose the fothers little people have mushdashes
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Anyone not going to mention that the emotions of the father and mom have the same features of the parents?
Mom: Ponytail and glasses
Dad: The mustache."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"come, fly with me , Gadjiniya))))))) lol"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,so thats whats happening in my parents minds XD
yRUAzGQ3nSY,How come the little girl has blue eyes when her father and mother have brown eyes?
yRUAzGQ3nSY, 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,NOT THE FOOT. NO!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Is anyone taking note of the inside looks and differences of the HQ for the emotions? For the dad, it has a more gloomy look, but is ultimately a happier place. It's quiet, and homey. While the mom has more of a warm tone, but less of a fun attitude with her emotions and ""train of throught"", ,but is still the head of the house in a way, although she pretends to be the backseat in most cases. In the daughter, it's, interestingly a mix of the two, a deep purple. It's a nice overlooked touch."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,ToM could

yRUAzGQ3nSY,so kinda like osmosis Jones
yRUAzGQ3nSY,It looks like a vert good movie. Im shut my kids will love it! They already fell in love just by watching the trailer! Lol!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"The foot is down

yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Anyone notice the ""Console Room"" or ""HQ"" for each person was different?

yRUAzGQ3nSY,0:20 Signal the husband!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The only problem is I wanted to go and watch it for my birthday but it's six days late
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I won't spoil anything, but Pixar premiered the first seven minutes of the movie at Northeastern University last week. All I'll say is they're QUITE good."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I wonder where the theorist will put this movie in the Pixar Theory Timeline ^^
yRUAzGQ3nSY,you have to love how balanced the adult emotions are.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,2:04 Mom's Anger: For this we gave up that Brazilian helicopter pilot?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,looks awesome! can't wait.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Boy is this sexist.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I will
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Looks like an animated version of the TV show 'Hermans Head' (1994)
Great job on originality, Disney. What TV/Movie show are you going to rip off next?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Looking forward to viewing  on June 19, 2015."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"""for this we gave up that brazilian helicopter pilot"", thanks wholesome family friendly disney for more perverse cartoons"

yRUAzGQ3nSY,Cnhra€%[4°[{°|°6|°[46
yRUAzGQ3nSY,They'll never put Herman's Head on DVD but this will do for now.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,That is the best movie I can't wait to get it!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I need to see this
"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,ЖДЁМ)))
yRUAzGQ3nSY,0:22 - 0:27 I swear I recognize that voice. Is she the voice of The Boss from Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater? I am pretty sure they are the same voice actors. Would anybody agree with me that she sounds like The Boss. 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,so cool im ga go see it
yRUAzGQ3nSY,the movie comes out on my birthday
yRUAzGQ3nSY,anyone else a little disturbed that the mother's core personality trait was sad? she is just a sad person?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Coool
"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Have to say how the childs voices aren't identical with hair and gender as the parents voices have same mustaches etc.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"why pixar is so good on doing things, like really. I cant even draw a good eyes :("
yRUAzGQ3nSY,It's like Herman's Head meets Monster's Inc. I love it.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Such a stereotype. But I like it, really interesting! Can't wait for it!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Halo Jones
"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The mom is deppressed the dad is stressed and the daughter is filled with joy
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I wanna see this
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I like how this deals with the idea of depression and the other emotions that are just kind of un explainable 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"(Sigh) .....Some more blues eyes and blonde hair! When is there going to a Mexican girl in the lead? Or an African. Hell! Give a mixed girl, we done already had blondes so many times!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,i'm excited for this
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Funny
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The anger here reminds me of a rock song by Three Days Grace - Just Like You.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,1:53 Disgusts dance though xD
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I want to see this movie so badly! ;)
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I want to work for Disney too... but I have no experience in what I want to do.

yRUAzGQ3nSY,"The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with edible multiple fruit consisting of coalesced berries, and the most economically significant plant in the Bromeliaceae family. Pineapples may be cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit, possibly flowering in 20–24 months and fruiting in the following six months. Pineapple does not ripen significantly post-harvest.﻿"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This looks super exciting! Thank you Pixar
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I wonder if this film will be just as sexist to women as it appears to be to men. I would love to see inside the mind of the 'brazilian helicopter pilot' too?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Sorry, maybe it's just me but...this movie ia about mental disorders?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Noted...the mom has an all female control room, the dad has an all male control room. The little girl has a mixture of both. Or am I reading far too deep into this? "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,cant wait to see it
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Nice one but I ve watched it on a website




"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The mother's glasses don't seem to have any lenses.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The Father's emotions were watching soccer in a different video! Which is it? Soccer or Hockey!? WHICH ONE!?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I saw a short video pn YouTube. It was the same!! Did they get the idea from this video?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Sometimes it better not to ask questions about a movie, like with reilys diffrent emotion gender. ive learned to just go with the flow."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I get what their going for, each person has a set of emotions, but some are more in control than others, such the father with anger, the mom with sadness, and Riley with all of them, depression, anger issues, and bipolar disorder. But that's just me"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love This

yRUAzGQ3nSY,BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Why Riley has male and female characters in his head? You know, the mother has only female characters and the opposite with the father..."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Wow! Pixar can sure get inside our heads!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I can't wait! It seems amazing!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,wow
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I have a feeling that throughout the movie, Riley will start to go through some changes, causing the Feelings to unexpectedly fuse creating new emotions, and then un fuse and wonder what's going on and why."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,lol
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"""Prepare the foot!!!""  :-)"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Oooone thing that confuses me about the way it's set up... The mother has all female representing her emotions, the father has male ones, but the daughter has a mix of both?? Shouldn't she just have like teenage girl ones?? ouo"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This is the most real movie ever. 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I really want a Wall-E 2. If you can make a sequel please make it good. 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Interesting that the mothers dominant emotion is sadness and the fathers is anger...
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This movie is kind of like Raven's emoticlones from Teen Titans! 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I wanna see this movie
yRUAzGQ3nSY,aawwsome!!!??????
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm actually excited for this!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I like how in this trailer the father watches hockey, and in the others he watches football."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I know the premise to this movie is the little girl (Riley) moving into a new town, and struggling with life..and after some serious thinking, I think I have an idea of what this movie is going to be about. Alright, so..notice how in the parent's brains their emotions are all agreeing with one another, and conforming under one leader? While, inside Riley's mind, everything is bonkers for control, and who gets to do what? I think this whole movie is about how Disgust and Anger think they have the most control in this mind, and Joy and the others don't seem to like it. While Riley is battling the real-world, the emotions in her head battle for dominance as Riley's main emotion, the one she usually turns to. Maybe they all have their own unique way they think Riley should grow up, like Anger thinks Riley should be mean and nasty, but assertive to get what she wants, while Fear thinks she should be sheltered and afraid to step out of her comfort zone. I really do think this movie is going to revolve around some sort of power struggle, and either Anger or Disgust is going to be the antagonist; but not exactly doing bad things, just trying to live life the way they think could protect the girl they live inside of.

Just thinking is all..this movie has great possibilities, and I am sooo excited for it!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This movie is packed with stereotypes..ugh
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Ha ha 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I've been wondering for some time now if animators have been studying Dr Ekman's work on facial expressions. After seeing this trailer, I'm certain of it! Nice work. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie. "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,1:44 Super saiyans....
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I'm calling it, Sadness will end up being this movie's hero."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Does the little girl have a gap? If she does then that makes me really happy because i have a gap and like Disney never has gaps :)
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I think I saw a similar animation to this on YouTube somewhere.......
It was slightly different but same concept if anyone could relate pleaaase respond"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Love it can't wait until the movie comes out
yRUAzGQ3nSY,HELP!!helplessness can t stop watching it again and again
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"The foot's down...
The Foot Is Down ... "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Awesome
yRUAzGQ3nSY,It worked better with the football (soccer) game in the UK trailer
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"How about we all see the movie first before we start tearing apart its social and emotional ramifications? We all understand not all moms and dads are like these parents, they can't show every single possible parent in this movie, they'd have to make 15 different movies, just accept the concept behind the movie for now until it comes out and stop wasting your time arguing on here, it's pitiful"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I CANT WAIT but i live in denmark so its gonna take longer time then becuse Danish voice over.... XC
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This movie is genius!!!!!! Super excited to see it.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I like to imagine later in the movie anger has the look of death in his eyes.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Can't wait to see this, it looks fun!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I am sooooooooooooo excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"You guys thinking this has deep psychological meaning or some kind of social justice stance are idiots.

Its just a movie for kids."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Lol, the guy announcing the hockey game at the beginning is in nhl 2k11!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,the movie dos not work
yRUAzGQ3nSY,It look great!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Well how is this gonna fit in ''The Pixar theory'' ?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Did anyone else notice that the Brazilian helicopter pilot looked like Miguel from Tekken?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I predict all the feels, followed by some serious introspection."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I can't wait for this movie, along with the new SpongeBob movie! I am a huge Pixar fan and I have been one ever since. Pixar has not released a single movie last year because they kept delaying release dates of upcoming Pixar films and closed Pixar Canada and stuff. But I am amazed that they are releasing two new movies this year!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"This looks amazing, but why does the little girl have blue eyes when both of her parents have either brown or hazel eyes?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,High levels of sass 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,So....HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOHN LASSERTER YOU DONT EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH OF AN INSPIRATION YOU ARE TO ME...HHHHHAAAAAPPPPPPPYYYYYY    BBBBBBBBBIIIIIIIRRRRRTTTTHHHHHHDDDDDDAAAAAYYY
yRUAzGQ3nSY,What if... the entire movie is just that one dinner conversation.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"So an ordinary man from the USA's mind looks like a war room?

I'm sure that fits the perception of most of the world. Thanks alot, Pixar."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Why Do I like watching this trailer over and over again?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Wait, so all the feelings in the mothers' head are girls and all the feelings in the dads' head are guys, but in the little girls' head, they're both guys and girls... Hmm. "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,They should have done football
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Looks like a good movie to me.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"It's a nice touch that the adults emotions work together, and the teenagers emotions are fighting and all over the place just like reality."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Oh 19th of June, my b-day. But I live in Sweden so this will probably be out like November 😑"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,in the British trailer they show the emotions watching a soccer game but in the us trailer they are watching a hockey game.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"alright, digging this trailer much more than the others I've seen.  Looks good!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Not disney but good try
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Disney, you are killing my feels here, and I love you for it!

So many expectations from this movie. :D"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Looks like we're gonna need a new Pixar Theory Video😫😖 Idk how they're gonna fix this 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love Pixar cartoons.... :) Thanks for sharing this!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,That's good 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I hope this whole thing doesn't stereotype dad's in an unfocused and bad parenting sort of way
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Well, in the woman's head there are only ""girls"" but in man's head there are only ""boys"" but in child's head there are boys and girls. Gender confirmed?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The emotions don't stay consistent with their character traits in the father and mother. Only Riley's does. But who knows until the film comes out.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Without pain, there is no joy "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Keep in mind that Anger has the head seat for both the dad and the girl, and Sadness has head seat for the mom.

Also keep in mind how for the dad, when anger says ""I don't wanna have to put the foot down,"" Fear stars trembling in fear.  However, after anger commands everyone to ""put the foot down,"" fear and everyone else stats cheering for the ""foot"".

This is an obvious sign that fear and sadness controls this obviously dysfunctional family.

Most likely, the movie will tell the tale of this family's journey into love and compassion rather than fear and sadness.  No spoilers intended, but I wouldn't be surprised if Joy eventually takes head chair by the end of the movie for the whole family."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Next Up From Pixar
yRUAzGQ3nSY,looking forward to this. 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,It looks a lot better with this trailer's release 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Before i even watched it i immediately thought of Osmosis Jones with a bit of ""What the Bleep do we know"" thrown in and i was right...what the mom is thinking about is MESSED UP .... nothing about it made me want to see it and i usually get ALL  3D movies for my 3D TV's"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"What do ya wanna bet the Tea Party crowd ties this movie to Common Core and the ""emotion bands"" kids are supposedly supposed to wear?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm scared of this movie I'm not 100 happy with  all the design  here.... Just breath and remember its Pixar so should be awesome... It's just a trailer 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"come, fly with me gatinha
hahaha cracked me up"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"OMG, Yes! 
This movie looks so good! I am definitely going to look for work at Pixar when I'm older. I mean like wow, It's so vibrant! I like it and can't wait for it."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Come fly with me kachinia
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I have a feeling that it will be about the maturing of the child
yRUAzGQ3nSY,That ending was funny
yRUAzGQ3nSY,love it i want to see it NOW!!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,One of the greatest mysteries of childhood: what goes on inside someone's head?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,this looks really cute!!!!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Disgust and Sadness in the dad's head looks young.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,well it looks good
yRUAzGQ3nSY,
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I wanna watch thius when it comes out lol
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This looks so good! So excited to see it.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I don't know about you but this is going to be good
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This looks AMAZING.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"The father's leading emotion seems to be Anger and the mom's is Sadness (is she depressed or something?) and they all look kinda like their people. But the girl's are different genders and stuff, maybe she's a bit confused?
Diagnosis? Puberty.
A cookie for everyone who gets that reference;)"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,KYLE!!!!!! knew that voice sounded familiar
yRUAzGQ3nSY,this seems a little bit like osmosis jones
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I seriously can't wait to see this movie! :D 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love how they managed to take dialogue that in any other movie would be insanely heavy and depressing and made it funny.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The voice of the brazilian guy was like Marmando's voice from gravity falls O.O
yRUAzGQ3nSY,did anybody see that the moms feelings where all girls and the dads was all guys but the kid had girls and guys ??
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Is that Steven Colbert as the dad?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I never watch movies in theaters. But this will be an exception..
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Lewis Black is gunna make this movie absolutely awesome! XD
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"- Come...fly with me, gatinha! S2"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Whoa. A whole movie personifying the character's emotions and thought patterns. This movie's gonna have some layers.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I think it's very interesting how the environments these emotions are in all look different. Riley's mind has it's own and somewhat indescribable background to it as she is still trying to figure things out while the backgrounds of her parents' minds help to define the interactions between the emotions. I love how the dad's mind is like Houston  bringing the astronauts home with a leader to whom everyone looks to in order to make a decision.  When he's got time off from dealing with a fight or flight situation, his emotions can hang out and have fun, but as soon as there's a problem, it turns into a bigger situation than it really is. Much like many type A people (myself included) we want things to be as simple as possible. So maybe in the mind of a type A person, trying to solve a confrontation would be like Houston trying to save the astronauts from hitting an asteroid.  In contrast, a type B personality (like the mother) is usually more free flowing and willing to adapt to a new situation. The mother's psychological landscape reminds me of a set of a talk show. Look at the curtain in the back and the desk, and those comfy looking chairs. The emotions all have obvious differences in personality and opinion much like the women on The View or The Talk. Even though Sadness has the head chair in the mother's head, her other emotions feel free to say how they feel about a problem and what they would do to solve it. Her inner monologue with her emotions really shines through as we see someone who is just as receptive to other people as well as her other, non-primary emotions."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,this actually looks good and original
yRUAzGQ3nSY,PIXAR IS BACK IN FINE FORM!!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The animation on Disgust is fantastic.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm just trying to imagine what it would be like looking at the emotions of a teen playing a competitive video game like DotA 2 or CS: GO.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,what disrespectful child bad kid dont listen to her children its not funny
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Gots to say, I seen this before. But where."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,this kid has no respect. Shouting shut up to her parents. And all they do is send her to her room. At least they should ground her or take something away..
yRUAzGQ3nSY,i feel a little bit JOYful about this movie. I can't wait to see it. I wonder what I will THINK about it. :P
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Joy, disgust, sadness,fear and anger have parents?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Uhhh...

I have no words, If those little things where inside my head, the would have no idea how to react to this, im just gonna go."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Looks fun, but how is this going to be a coherent story ?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,exactly how politics work!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Hmm...very interesting. Pixar might have found its second wind.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,0:51 - Can someone explain why this response is wrong??
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Isn't love an emotion? 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I like it
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Yeah, This looks good."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I am Groot.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,umm why is love not there but disgust and fear are
yRUAzGQ3nSY,SIR REPORTING HIGH LEVELS OF SASS
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Hopefully this was a gag, if this mind switch thing happens often the movie will be hard to follow"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This seems like a good idea for a 10 minute video but I don't know about a whole movie.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,this looks just like the comic The Numskulls
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I want to see this #awesone
"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This looks surprisingly entertaining.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,rule 63 here they come
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Wow, I don't think I could ever be a writer at Pixar, their writing is way to clever and smart."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Omg this is funny
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I just hope that at least one of the emotions will yell ""WE THREW OUT HIS NAME!!!"""
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Looks good, reminds me a lot about a sketch of francois perusse though"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"""For this, we gave up that Brazilian helicopter pilot?!""

I barely know what this movie is about and I already love it."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Yes. Just, yes."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Bravo XD
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm kind of disappointed that all their emotions look alike. I was kind of hoping that each human has their own set of unique looking emotions rather than recycling the same character models. I know it'd be more expensive but still...
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Its so cute I cant wait to see it this summer☺😄😁
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I hope this'll be a Success Like Monsters University, now that had a lot of fame in 2013, until Frozen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Looking forward to this movie!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Cooooooooooooooooooooooollllllll
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Wasn't this idea used in a short animation a while ago?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm so excited for this movie to come out!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The Dad looks like Jason Lee when he played in My Name Is Earl :D
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love Sadness she looks cute I can't wait to see her personality.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Still waiting for Geri's Game 2
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This trailer is making me feel schizophrenic o _ o
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I cannot WAIT!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Está muy bueno él video
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Looks exactly like the animated short ""Brain Divided"" by Josiah Haworth, Joon Shik Song & Joon Soo Song. Wonder if they're working on the project or if Disney/Pixar just ripped-off their idea."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,0:32 Did anyone else notice that in the UK version of this trailer that instead of hockey they watch soccer?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This looks more like a movie clip than an actual trailer..
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Finding dory are coming in summer 2016! 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Pretty awesome and very inventive, Best film of the year!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Brandon Sanderson should sue.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I dont care Im watching this
yRUAzGQ3nSY,El tráiler de un error al principio en el primero cómo quiero vida con un partido ahora lo veo en un campeonato de hielo
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Staying cautiously optimistic. Don't pull a Cars 2 on me Pixar.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm 10...
yRUAzGQ3nSY,what is the name of the song start at 1:09?? thanks you
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Looks interesting
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Two words:  chemical imbalance.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"??)&9$$8))9€888$$@@!@&@&$!$$8&&&&$$$$$.5310):4556777777777776(66567(676)66))6(((;7789&9)
Iuuhjiykv gngteqwaetuienqywwqqwqaeerrttyiopooiooooopoookoooooooljokoiijj"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,i really wanna see this movie <3
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Omg!!! i cant wait to see this movie!!! i'm so excited :D
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I actually have seen this type of thing before in older cartoons, when one goes inside a person's head and you can see little beings running the mind. It's interesting to take this on as the major theme and focus of the movie and fun seeing the stereo-typical roles broken down. I have to say I'm actually intrigued."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Soooo...The father is controlled by anger and mom by sadness? Sounds a bit..dysfunctional to me. >> 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,The concept is very interesting. Can't wait to see what they do with it.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I just love this, what a creative take on human emotion!! I think it's so cool how they show the differences between how children and adults manage their emotions. As you get older, it can get easier to manage your emotions because you'll be more in tune with yourself and just what you're feeling. Dealing with things in a calm, rational manner is something that can unify differing emotions. That's why they look the same in the mom and dad's heads, but not the girl's. In adolescents, like Riley, there's more of a divide between differing emotions. Also, in this movie, I really like that they show that people can sometimes be primarily motivated by a certain emotion. The dad responds with anger while the mom responds with sympathy. It's not that they only feel sadness or anger, it's just that everybody has a certain emotion that can trigger a more effective response in a ""fight or flight"" situation."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Oh my god this looks AMAZING
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I don't know wether to be happy feared discussed sad or just angry (it's a joke don't get mad)
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm not sure what to think about this one. I'd have to see a few more trailers to get an idea of what I think.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I just realized, in the international version, the husband was watching soccer. Why would bother to change it to hockey? "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This feels good! :D
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Not impressed.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I also notice that there's a different leader-emotion for the dad than the mom (Dad ruled by anger,  mom by sadness). Maybe that's also a puberty thing,  a grab for power by the emotions to determine Riley's leader voice."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I was wondering if the emotions were gonna be uniform from person to person. I love that they have something to tie them to their human.  Maybe Riley's change to adapt more to her through the movie. 

I'll have to watch it again,  but were the voices the same for all the emotions per head (same anger, fear, etc)?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Cranium Command: the Movie?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Joy doesn't do much in either of the parent's minds. Kinda sad really. Like the mother's mind, who has sadness in control.

While the father's anger is in control.

I predict a very dark subtext to be prevalent through out that will only vaguely get touched on via Pixar's usual deft storytelling prowess."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This movie is looker better with each trailer.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Looks brilliant and so funny! Awww, sweet emotions... lol"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love it!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This seems funny :D
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This looks so good!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Looks great! cannot wait!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Here It Come.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I have a good feeling for this one!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I know im gonna love this movie! :)
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Anybody notice that on this channel, the characters in the dad's mind were watching a hockey game, but on the Movieclips Channel they were watching a soccer game?"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,If you pay attention the girl's mind is more colorful and open and her little minions are more glittery and sparkly and the parents' minions are more like the same thing. I guess it's because when you're a teen you're emotions are heightened and more defined.  
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"BTW.. When the brazilian pilot says ""Fly with me, gatinha"" the ""gatinha"" means like sugar, honey, cutie, babe..... Etc "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,OMG SO GREAT!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"LOL. Anger on the thumbnail. XD And plus, I'm not sure if this movie could be that good. I mean, the only thing I liked is Joy, Disgust, Anger, Fear, and Sadness. :P"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"This is basically the same as the UK trailer, except they changed the sport the guy was watching from soccer to hockey to appeal more to the states."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I'm looking forward to all the Easter eggs in this movie more than the movie itself. 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,DefCon?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I knew this movie would be greate. But i still dont like the character design. 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,All doubts have been quenched with this trailer and I am definitely going I watch this. :D
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Aww it look adorable xD can't wait hahaha
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Funnily while all the numbskulls* in the woman's head are female and all the ones in the man's head are male, the ones in the girl's head are a mixture of male and female ones, i guess they're a mix of the ones in her parent's heads, but when she grows up will the male ones ""retire"" and be replaced by female ones, or will she always have a mixture.

If she remains to have a mixture, does that mean she'll be bisexual? :) .

Also, do the little people/creatures in the character's heads, have little people/creatures in their heads and if they do, those even smaller people/creatures have EVEN smaller people/creatures in their heads etc, continuing on to infinite? :) .

(*The name of the creatures in the heads of people in a comic strip with the same general idea :) .)"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Can't wait to see this.  So far, it looks absolutely hilarious."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I have a good feeling about this!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Curious what the difference is between this trailer and the UK one released the other day? They're watching hockey instead of soccer (football). That's it.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I can't wait for the movie!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"This looks like this'll be amazing (at least I hope so). I expect nothing less from Pete Doctor. Monsters Inc and Up are some of the best Pixar films, in my opinion. "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I can't wait until this movie comes out! :D
yRUAzGQ3nSY,do the emotions have emotions?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Only saw a two minute scene and I already love this movie. Nice job Pixar!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I've been looking forward to this movie since it was first announced! So excited that it is finally coming out!! ^_^
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"As a current psychology student, this made me very happy. lol XD LOVE it! can't wait!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Weer geniaal bedacht! Ik kan niet wachten tot hij in de bioscoop is! Pixar doet 't weer goed hoor
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Huh, interesting..."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This makes a lot more sense than the previous teasers.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Oh
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Two things I noticed:

1. From what we can see of the mom's ""memories"" (those colored orbs in the background), she seems to have a pretty calm demeanor. I don't see a single red orb back there.
2. This is actually quite perfect because the emotions in the parents' minds are a well-oiled machine. They're generally on the same level with each other and everything's in control. In Riley's growing mind, however, her emotions seem to be having a hard time getting along and maintaining peace and understanding each other.

Pixar, this is why I love you again and again. :D"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,gatinha hahaha awesome
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"One thing I noticed is the Emotions inside the parents heads
Mom-Sadness
Dad-Anger

Says a LOT about their characters."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I am so Excited!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,i love how each emotion in every person is the same except for the hair styles or mustaches :P
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I thought we'd just see ""Riley's"" emotions in the movie."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Cool
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I want Monsters Inc 2.  :(
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I love how sadness drives the Mom and anger drives the Dad.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Any chance of making the trailer accessible with closed captions ? 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I have to wonder if the old ""Cranium Command"" attraction that used to be at Epcot was the inspiration of this."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"it seems like all the emotions are united i the parents minds. They don't argue with each other. Meanwhile, in Rileys mind all emotions seem to have different opinions and arguing with each other. Maybe that's something about the story. The emotions need to be united and form her personality. Meanwhile is the process of growing up."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"very humerous alternative, unque prespective 
very impresive Pixar :-)
hope you get a good story to balance it out"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Looks really interesting.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,oh god!!! this is so awesome!!!!!!!!  eagerly waiting :)
yRUAzGQ3nSY,.... So i have a bunch of living parasites living somewhere in my head taking control of me?!?!!?
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"""The foot is down! The foot! Is! Down!"" "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Oh this looks sooooo fun! :D I really hope there will be more of this parental interaction in the movie, because so far they said the focus was on the little girls emotions Sadness and Joy."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I think Inside Out is a pretty cool gal. Esh is fed up and doesnt afraid of anything.
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This looks like it will be great !!!!!!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,And still no INCREDIBLES 2
yRUAzGQ3nSY,10/10 I cry every time 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"It's ironic that, for a movie focusing on a GIRL'S inner emotions, its trailer showcases more of her parents' emotions!"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,one of the most anticipated movies of 2015!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"I must say, this concept is a fairly interesting one. 
I find it funny that the dad's mind is more like a military base while the mom's and child's respective brains look more casual.
I look forward to the final product with anticipation."
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This is fractal! Even the emotions are showing emotions. So deep.. cant wait!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,hahahaha amazing! funny and well thought out! expert storytelling wow!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This film is gonna be great!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"0:33 He is 'watching' Ice hockey in his mind.
In the UK version of the trailer, he is watching soccer instead.
Pixar really knows how to localize, eh ;)"
yRUAzGQ3nSY,This is gonna be interesting :P
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"Oh interesting,  they changed the sport inside the dad's head comparing to the UK trailer.  It was soccer/football and now it's hockey "
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Need. This. NOW!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Genius. THIS is the real Pixar!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,Looks awesome!
yRUAzGQ3nSY,i think i hearad of that attitude maybe she can control it
yRUAzGQ3nSY,I want to see this movie 
yRUAzGQ3nSY,"That should be pretty good story, start was so far very interesting."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"why is there so many dislikes, this is the best movie of 20178"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"On this day, something unspeakable was unleashed.. *[Play dead island trailer theme]*
It was just a normal Thursday, everyone woke up, got dressed, and headed down to breakfast. Many brewed a cup of coffee, some may have even grabbed a glass of water.

Sitting them selves down, they begin to browse the web as they wake up. Scrolling through the news, they fly by something, only to freeze. Sliding the phone screen back up, they see it. 

....


*The Emoji Movie*

They begin to gag, choking for air as they hit the kitchen floor with a swift 'thud'. They lay there quietly, watching outside their windows as their life force fades away.

This same behavior spreads globally, dropping earths population soon into the hundreds. As the numbers drop fast, only one individual remains.

This last young man wakes up, only to find the entire world dead. He sits there, complelty in shock.
With his head in his hands, he receives a 'beep' from his phone. Looking up, he grabs it, swipping at the lock screen. Seeing the caption appear, he knows what he must do.

But before he attempts to take his own life, the phone dies. Leaving him in a petrified silence.

He had been watching to much porn the night prior, so his phone battery drained. 

As this realization kicks in, he lets out a shout of anger. 

""CURSE YOU PORN HUB!""

The camera pans out of the house, up into the sky, and fades to black.


                        *The End*"

r8pJt4dK_s4,"You hate the movie... but are you still going?  If yes, then I reserve the right to call you an idiot.

If the movie stinks, just don't go!  And convince others not to go either."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"One day, all of this pain shall end"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The tell-tale sign of cringey, bad scriptwriting: Having characters with British accents using Americanisms, like 'potty' and 'candy'. It was true for the Ice Age sequels and here it is again."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony you suck  join in on the new minecraft  edition  with Xbox  cross  play
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Think about this.
The same people that made this made ghostbusters 2016

r8pJt4dK_s4,Am i the only one that thinks that emoji with blue hair and hat is Chloe from life is strange?
r8pJt4dK_s4,This video has 80k dislikes
r8pJt4dK_s4,You can remove dislikes
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I have a theory. Sony wanted to make the worst meme worthy movie, just to get so much hate, people will end up watching it to see ""how terrible it is."" Plus, you have YouTube, and... everyone is talking about it. Whether it's a quick mention or an entire video based on it, people are talking about this movie. Reviewers will watch it to criticize it, because everyone wants to know what it will be like. Already, you've got a crap ton of people who are talking about it and the other half buying tickets. The public think they are intelligent for figuring out that they are making the movie directed towards people who love emojis, but that is exactly what they want you to think. Rather, they want you to hate it so much, you'll end up watching it."
r8pJt4dK_s4,They're gonna lose so much money on this movie I stg
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This movie makes me want to 
💪🔪😔🔫 because of how much faith I've lost in humanity... They cancelled or ""delayed"" the Popeye movie for this garbage..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why the hell does this movie have so much hate?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! This could actually be a good movie if people would just give it a CHANCE for Pete sake all the 80k people who disliked this apparently HATE emojis and I wonder if one of the people who hate this movie is commenting on the trailer WITH A EMOJI. I think that might have happened I'm not saying that I know for sure though.

You deserve everything bad happening to you after fails like Pixels, and treating Ghostbusters fans like women hating filth and the disaster Amy Pascal was.

r8pJt4dK_s4,Honestly there is a lot of hate about this movie and my opinion I don't hate it but I don't like it either. It looks alright in animation wise it's different from most movies I have seen which I kind of approve. Even though it's not the best animation like Big Hero 6 or even Cars 3 but I will give it credit for trying to be different but not gonna give it hate since I am trying to look in the bright side and say I might see it and give it a chance cause who knows it might be surprisingly good.

CHESTER HUNG HIMSELF BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"When you make movies based on something relevant, you need to make sure the release date is when it's still popular. If ""The Emoji Movie"" came out in 2014 or 2015, it would make a little more sense since that was when emojis were used more in pop-culture.  Now, not really, as the big trends this year are fidget spinners, Ed Sheeran, etc (NO, PLEASE NOT A FIDGET SPINNER MOVIE. HELL NO.)  Same if the Angry Birds movie came out in 2010 or 2011.  I know that animated movies take a few years to make.  So what you should probably do, Sony, is stop making these ""current trend movies"" now. Sadly it looks like that won't happen though, as they're apparently making a sequel to Angry Birds..."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"This movie in a nutshell:

You know those things that all kids who are 6 years old use on their iPhone 7+ gold. EMOJIS!! We bring to you a movie that we made out of taking emojis, giving them body's, and come up with the most basic plot line possible!! You want more? Well how about exclusively adding every stereotype imaginable, such as: THE SMART CHICK, THE COOL GUY, THE NERD, and so much more! We were even too lazy to come up with a creative name for the movie! We pray you'll be back soon, because we just wasted 2 hours of your day!!💩"

r8pJt4dK_s4,i might go see it for the bants.
r8pJt4dK_s4,they must be runing out of ideas now
r8pJt4dK_s4,"They cancelled popeye movie for this. Popeye is probably my favorite cartoon aside from Tom and Jerry, and you cancelled it. Why you gotta do this to me, Sony?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Only 9 more days until the shittiest Movie of 2017 comes out! Make sure you don't watch it kids! Or you have a extremely high risk of getting the following diseases, cancers, etc.        Leukemia, Ebola, Zika West Nile Virus, Measles, Lung Cancer, Heart Attack, there are a lot more to list. but the worst of all, is.............. EMOJISLOUTITUS!!!
Emojisloutitus is the worst kind of cancer ever! When you get you will have about 5 minutes to live.... you get it by watching the EMOJI MOVIE!!! 
Some say that the reason Emojisloutitus exists is just from the existence of emojis THEMSELVES! So be safe kids!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Everyday we get closer releasig this monster we stray further from god
r8pJt4dK_s4,Read the description: They can't even get their own tagline right.

Sony is just gonna make more Emoji Movies if you do."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sidious: ""the time has come..execute order 66""
*bombs sony*"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Hi
r8pJt4dK_s4,THIS TRAILER IS FULL OF CANCER 😭
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Since I was 9 years old, I saw As my Grandfather Paterno died slowly Cause of the Cigar, Thanks to a powerful cancer, Of which I gave the Promise of not following his path, I was so sad to see it So, But Today, that Promise Is Breaking, since seeing this Great Slut, gave me 4 Types of Cancer.

Thank's You Emojis"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Who do they think will watch this? Edgy 9 year olds? 
They could get a way larger audience with Popeye, what were they THINKING?!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I know a lot of people have their doubts, but the Emoji Movie will be the saving grace for Hollywood and perhaps the movie industry itself. For far too long, films have been about things that audiences simply don't care about. Forrest Gump? More like a 70s time piece. Mad Max: Fury Road? No one wants to watch a documentary about how Australia won its independence. Star Wars? Not a single audience member will remember it in five years. Sony made the right decision in giving audiences something they care about: emojis. What's happening in the world within your phone? The Emoji Movie will be a masterpiece based solely on this principle. In theaters July 28th."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I cant wait till the floor is lava movie comes out
r8pJt4dK_s4,"If I can't fap to a movie

r8pJt4dK_s4,Can anonymous hack song so they can cancel this movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,I heard that the 3 branches of the U.S Government decided to nuke their country in 3 months after they saw this horrible trailer
r8pJt4dK_s4,The only thing to blame is Toy Story. Apparently Toy Story influenced the creation of this movie. How nice.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Hollywood... Just stop. Honestly, you're not even trying anymore."
r8pJt4dK_s4,God has left the Server
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Instead of just turning down the volume, I'll just throw my phone around for comedic effect!"

r8pJt4dK_s4,"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?"

r8pJt4dK_s4,Its impossible to have a full world of Ai based emojis in your phone even if a phone had enough processing power it would constantly be under 100% load therefor causing the battery to drain incredibly quickly. Then even if it was actually being run by an offsite supercomputer and being streamed to your phone over the cloud somehow then it still wouldn't be in your phone it would be on a server/supercomputer 0/10 don't watch plox

r8pJt4dK_s4,🍆 the eggplant emoji always gets used!
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why didn't my boi just delete the message?!
r8pJt4dK_s4,It genuinely reaffirms my faith in humankind to see how many people recognise that this film is nothing but complete and total pandering. Thank you internet.
r8pJt4dK_s4,😒
r8pJt4dK_s4,*On July 28th* I will fucking kill myself.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"will we be expecting ""the fidget spinner movie?"""

r8pJt4dK_s4,How's this got so many dislikes
r8pJt4dK_s4,James corden!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Aside from the concept being based on emojis, what other aspect of this movie is essentially bad so that it will deserve this like/dislke ratio?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,2017 already ruined
r8pJt4dK_s4,I've seen it all now.
r8pJt4dK_s4,wait this sounds like the bee movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Next from Sony -Cancer- Pictures, the Fidget Spinner movie!!! This movie will have a store with a secret world of fidget spinners, and then there's a fidget spinner called Spinner who want to be a fidget cube but his parent won't let him be one, then he meets an emo fidget spinner called Cube that wants to help/date him. Be sure not to miss this -cancer-!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Jeezuz the dislikes though!!

r8pJt4dK_s4,lol July 28 is my b day
r8pJt4dK_s4,fun fact all comments get deleted every once and a while on this video
r8pJt4dK_s4,Hannah baker made the right choice.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm honestly not seeing why this movie is getting so much hate. The trailer was pretty funny and doesn't look half bad. I guess people feel they need to whine about every little thing in life.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I will watch this and kill myself after so you don't have to watch this
r8pJt4dK_s4,"this comes out in 3 weeks. this is the end, isn't it"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me Me Big Boy

r8pJt4dK_s4,did they cancel this? Also this phone must have multiple terabytes of space to contain a whole city.
r8pJt4dK_s4,God help us...
r8pJt4dK_s4,😱 😱😱😱😱 🤤.             💩 😾
r8pJt4dK_s4,The directors were either drunk or dead inside
r8pJt4dK_s4,"i don't get why the dislike ratio is so high. just because the concept is based on emojis? i don't use emojis either, but it's a neat little concept."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Haven't seen a like/dislike ratio this bad since CoD Infinite Warfare and Misha.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"who hurt you, Sony"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I love emojis😍😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,...yuck
r8pJt4dK_s4,"My favourite part was the poop part, because it describes how this movie will turn out."
r8pJt4dK_s4,They need more creative people on their animation teams this is so bland. Its usually the younger people with the bigger imaginations not the old people who make up a boring ideas to appeal to children
r8pJt4dK_s4,Tf is that
r8pJt4dK_s4,Those emojis have seen your nudes
r8pJt4dK_s4,"all we need now is fidget spinner the movie





featuring Jacksfilms"
r8pJt4dK_s4,That emoji with the blue hair low-key looks like Sandara Park from 2ne1 during Come back home era
r8pJt4dK_s4,Can't tell if there using Android or apple emojis
r8pJt4dK_s4,Wtf Sony
r8pJt4dK_s4,a new meme
r8pJt4dK_s4,Apparently emojis live like humans and there is a domesticated city for them inside your smartphone.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie could actually be an interesting concept if the main characters weren't virtual keyboard faces. Is it really that hard to come up with ideas hollywood?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"2018: the fidget spinner movie
2019: the bottle flipping movie
2020: the floor is lava movie
2021: the pokemon go movie with the original song ""I play pokemon go everyday""
2022: the 3am movie
2023: the meme movie

then Sony animations will be shut down forever."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Why are all the comments so new even though the trailer was released over a month ago. 

Dafuq? 

What the hell are you up to Sony?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,please cancel this
r8pJt4dK_s4,is it bad that i kinda want to see this movie as a college student
r8pJt4dK_s4,no one will ever send an emoji again when this comes out

r8pJt4dK_s4,Is that fucking Chloe from life is strange

r8pJt4dK_s4,"The weird thing is when this came on in the theater people were clapping...




Kill me"
r8pJt4dK_s4,The creators of these type of movies assume the kids are stupid. The funny stuff in all this is the fact this film will age terribly in 5 years.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This world sucks:(
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony CLEARLY ran out of ideas 🤦‍♂️
r8pJt4dK_s4,it's toy story or foodfight but with emoji's
r8pJt4dK_s4,16k likes is at least 15k likes too many and 71k dislikes is at least 150k too few
r8pJt4dK_s4,Vem kommer från therese?💖
r8pJt4dK_s4,the first mass suicide in a movie theater shall take place very soon
r8pJt4dK_s4,Watch This be the Next Frozen All they have to do is make a catchy song to children.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This actually doesn't look that bad considering all the generic marvel crap/michael bay they've been feeding us for the past few years. I can probably get a chuckle because of how corny it is
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I can just see it now... Rotten tomatoes will give it a fresh rating... Really though what if it actually turned out to be good? Chances of that are extremely slim, but who knows? 😒 (I'm never doing that again)"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why...? Just why....?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Their city is call ""textapolis"". No joke I wanted to break my phone."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I wonder what other movies Wreck it ralph inspired

r8pJt4dK_s4,Whenever someone texts me about my thoughts on this movie i just send a meh back
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Please, cancel the moviel"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Every day we stray further away from god
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The Emoji Movie's true message: If you are different, you will die. 

And this doesn't apply to Gene and all the other misfit emojis. This also applies to the human world as well. Notice how EVERY SINGLE KID in this trailer has a cell phone? This movie wants you to believe that if you don't text, send emojis, and/or own a cell phone, you should not be considered a member of the human race. This movie must be removed from theaters effective immediately before it can poison both the minds of our posterity and the human race as a whole."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Autism the movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,shut up u stupid people it will be a good movie so shut
r8pJt4dK_s4,Oh god why

r8pJt4dK_s4,🐘🗯
r8pJt4dK_s4,What if the movie turned out to be good and everyone was mistaken? It is a possibility since you could make a good film about anything it just depends on the execution. Although I admit it does have a strong chance to be trash considering the use of emojis to pander to millennials and the plot appears to be a ripoff of wreck it ralph and inside out but not all ripoffs are garbage and  if they really did put alot of time effort and care into this (ALOT) it might actually be good.

r8pJt4dK_s4,✋🏻👊🏻
r8pJt4dK_s4,it is sad how many dislikes this got. I will definitely go watch this!!!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"To be honest, I don't think this movie deserves all the hate it's getting. Besides, the movie hasn't even come out yet*. Yes it does look like its ripping off Wreck-It Ralph and maybe Inside Out,  But films like Before I Fall practically ripped off Groundhog Day, and that did just fine with critics and audiences (and that's saying a lot for a film produced by Awesomeness TV), so maybe you should at least give the film a chance or whatever. 

* Except for Ghostbusters (2016), You were all right about that."
r8pJt4dK_s4,😛👻 🕋
r8pJt4dK_s4,it's good
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Obviusly this is best than Popeye, Sony you're dumb asses"

It's about a man name Steve who works as a post-production supervisor at SONY(He Hates his job). He has a friend named Michael that wants to be an actor. Michael always gets rejected from many film productions because of his singing. Steve has a crush on an art director named Sara(who will be Steve's girlfriend at the end of the movie). Steve wishes that he could run his own film production and be like his father. His father was once a director and a producer but sadly died. He is frustrated with all of these sh***y movies like The Emoji Movie, Norm of the North, Ghostbusters(2016), the Transformers movies and etc. He learns about a time machine that was invented not to long ago. Steve eventually steals it. So Steve, Michael and Sara go on an adventure to stop the sh***y movies from being made. They also look back on many good movies from many companies like Disney and Dreamworks. Along the way, there being chased be many horrible directors like Michael Bay and Zach Snyder with there evil army of robots(robots made from SONY). Steve will also learn that things will happen and we need to accept it or ignore it. At the climax Michael Bay and Zachary Snyder will die from falling into a pit of lava. Since Steve went backed in time, it affected the space time continuum every single horrible movie never existed. Steve quits his job at SONY and runs his film production. Steve finale gets the girl. He also hires Michael to be an actor in his business. They continuously made a load of great movies. This eventually put SONY out of business. 

THE END 

""So kids the moral is to never make sh***y movie and accept the future."""

r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is the most idiotic, predictable, disgusting, wasteful, irresponsible, disruptive move in entertainment history. The trailer showcases the whole film, and the whole plot. Wait, nevermind there is no plot. They just threw dilemmas at an idea that will get kids excited because it's in their everyday use, even though it shouldn't be. But hey
Natural selection, am I right? 
Sorry I saw this and just cringed the hardest I have in a long time

To be honest even when I watched this trailer, I didn't think of any other movie but instead I enjoyed how creative they were on bringing such idea about emojis, not to mention that it fits so well to this generation that is full of emojis during chats. 
I don't understand the hate but I am gonna watch this movie and enjoy it on its own instead of comparing it to others. Just a tip for you all, comparing things to others won't give you any enjoyment in life."

There is no way in heck I am wasting MY money or my parents' money to see this poorly made ""Wreck-it Ralph"" and ""Inside Out"" wannabe! Nobody will!

r8pJt4dK_s4,Lol Candy Crush why dont clash royale xD
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Just a few questions:
Why do emojis have children?
Why do they have too different 'meh's?
Can emojis retire?
Do the emojis make money if they can retire?
Do the emojis that are used more often than others make more money if they do earn money?
Do they have complicated ideas like government?
What do they think of religious emojis?
How do they procreate?
If the emojis can enter candy crush, can they enter google? 
If they can enter google can they go to the kids search history and enter something like pornhub?
What happens if the phone dies? 
What about other apps other than the Text app?
Can we see like twitter birds flying around?
Hopefully these questions can be answered "

r8pJt4dK_s4,We are all going to die
r8pJt4dK_s4,"did we ask for this? no we didn't. either make a somewhat good spider man movie or hop on the making movies based on peoples childhoods bandwagon. the only people who are going to see this are hipsters who think emojis are cool, or single parents who are trying desperately to be cool with their kids."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Dear Sony, 
You should probably take the like to dislike ratio as a warning. You really shouldn't let this movie play in any theaters. It will hurt your company greatly, and also fire the person who came up with the idea to make this movie. The movie would be somewhat less AIDS if the candy crush ad would be taken out. Also, read more comments on the trailer. Think of this economically - You are the producer - you produce what US - the consumers - want. It's such a simple concept and you guys wasted so much time on this when you could've made something more original and not so... cringe. Seriously. You've canceled it once, and it was a very bad idea to bring it back.
Best,
The public."

These dislikes restore some respect, but some people will actually defend this movie. I'm not saying you can't like this, I guess you have an interesting opinion, but please just look at the facts and at least wait until you can rent it. 

Don't pay full price for tickets. I hope this may have helped some people reconsider."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"First of all the trailer spoils the whole story, which is bland and uninspired. So much so that I think I can write a better story right now by just making things up. I want to make a movie about a stick man. Like a literal stick man. Like he's made out of sticks. He randomly comes to be in the woods and some kids find him. He has human emotions and learns to talk and eventually starts going to school where (instead of the cliche bullying route where everyone makes fun of him for being different.) He fits in and everyone accepts him despite his uniqueness. But there will still be lots of opportunities for comedy as the stick man does not well understand human behaviors and is disposed to being highly environmental and always wanting to spend time outside. (Though the environmental messages will be troden on carefully and done subtly to avoid preachy fern gully/ James cameron avatar levels of we're drestroying the planet). It can also have a commentary on human relations as the stick man has an outside perspective on people. There I came up with a better story. Where's my 100mil and animation crew? If this garbage can be made into a movie than why can't my story?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,😕 wtf is this who would want to see this it is just another Sony cash grab congrats Sony u f*cked up again.

r8pJt4dK_s4,Eggplant should not be in loser lounge we know what he represents
r8pJt4dK_s4,Lego Movie clone but much worse and much more pandering
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Talking piles of poop? Really? This looks like a commercial to market cell phones to kids. The plot also looks super unoriginal. I remember when cartoons used to be FUN, innocent and full of dancing and singing. Now most of them have a formulaic plot and try to have some mushy social message about ""being yourself"" that has been done over and over!"

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony, why did you cancel/delay Popeye for this nonsense?!?!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Even though this movie is a rip off  of many other movies, there is one thing that really gets me mad. What is the purpose of this emoji girl (the one with black hair and a hat)? Why can't it be a budgie film about an emoji trying to find his true self, figuring out he's really not a meh but a exclusive emoji. And can't the hand emoji be a comic relief. And maybe the antagonist could be the parents, for one it could be a twist to the ""find your self"" cliché and could make a really good story about who you should trust. Anything would be better this this plot.😤😤😤😥😥😥😣😣😣"

r8pJt4dK_s4,What is this.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I don't think the best script or story line, but credit is due to animators. The actual art looks very nice, and to be honest, probably the only reason I'd stay and watch this."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Nigga I use the eggplant emoji daily
r8pJt4dK_s4,The eggplant emoji is one of the most used emojis in the entire selection. I don't understand how they could be so wrong.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Guarantee this grosses over 100 mill, meanwhile a masterpiece like Kubo and the Two Strings which has flawless animation and an original story only grossed 74 mill. Our Culture is fucking dying."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Ladies and gentlemen, Cancer has evolved into the final stages"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Look at the bright side this will  become an opportunity for ytp and dank memes
r8pJt4dK_s4,"So the meh emoji is supposed to follow one path because hes meh, but he's trying to be other emojis and freaks out when he has to be the center of attention (anxiety) the fact he's the meh emoji shows a lack of caring and possible depression. In the context of the real world, hes trying to break his path to be more diverse and to be what he wants to be. I think that his family are meh emoji shows that ( in real life) that we grow up being guided to follow one path and people often except that. But not the meh emoji? The scene with the firewall shows him trying to figure something out or fix something, but he finds himself fail a couple times despite the help of others. He tries to remember the name of a girl to get threw the wall and I think that's ( in real world) someone looking for themselves and to find the answer for them to break threw there wall.
when he gets anxiety and makes a different face he gets questioned for it. his 2 friends. the goth is his bad path and the high five is the other side of him saying everything will be OK. so I don't think they have ran out if ideas"

Normally, I wouldn't care if some greedy company made a shitty, obnoxious, abhorrent, repetitive ""movie"" that panders to idiot children and idiot adults on a low budget for lots of money. But now, we have reached a new low. That low being that there is a movie being made that not only follows the pattern of so many other god-awful movies like, say, the minions or the lorax. This movie is going to be based around something that is already worshipped and sensationalised by teenagers and adults with half their brain cells missing. I think I got cataracts just from the thumbnail of this video. Please for the love of god  don't bring this loathsome, detestable, cookie cutter piece of absolute garbage into existence."

r8pJt4dK_s4,The worst part begins in min 0:01
r8pJt4dK_s4,"You know honestly, it doesn't look half bad. This is a really interesting premise that kinda reminds me of Inside Out a bit. It doesn't seem particularly hilarious, but it doesn't come off like a comedy cemetery either. It will be serviceable at the very least I think."
r8pJt4dK_s4,emojis?? sorry but that white girl trend died off in 2013
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I don't know; the movie honestly looks pretty adorable in it's own right. It reminds me of Inside Out, but except having the human forms of emotion make the decisions in someone's mind, you have the emoji's controlling the expression of how a text is formed to another person.

Both have an array of goofy characters controlling something or someone. Like, it blows my mind how bad a rep this movie is getting. If it sucks, it sucks, and I'll find out AFTER ACTUALLY SEEING THE MOVIE. You are all crotchety 90 year old adults with no sense of fun or imagination."
r8pJt4dK_s4,emoji = ban >:v
r8pJt4dK_s4,#HailGrasa >:v
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I don't get all the hate on this movie. Someone please tell me 5 reasons to hate this movie. Beside the ones mentioned here.
Meanwhile, I'm going to try to disprove the most common hates on it.
1. Cliche: There really is nothing wrong with cliche. Some might say, ""its overused"", but that's exactly what cliche is, so explain what's wrong with overused. And it doesn't seem _that_ cliche, anyway.
2. Ripoff: lots of people say it's a ripoff of wreck it ralph and inside out. It really isn't, if you actually pay attention to the trailer. It's true that it has a similar concept to wreck it ralph, but the story isn't exactly the same like some might say. Emoji movie is a story of self discovery, who he is meant to be. Wreck it ralph isn't self discovery, it's a mix of redemption and accepting who you are. And honestly I don't get the relation to inside out. And also, at least it's not like a super cheap ripoff like Great Value off of everything(no offense, but seriously)
3. The Popeye movie: they didn't _popeye_ movie for this. They _delayed_ It. So stop spreading lies! And popeye movie is about an ordinary world, where all the rules are the practically the  same, but it has a guy with spinach powers. I would rather see a movie with a whole new undiscovered world where there's not much insight on what it's about.

Other things 
1. Animation is good
2. Story seems at least decent, not as bad as everyone following internet hate says it it.
3. Concept is interesting
4. Humor is meh... gonna be honest
5. Plot is creative and interesting

I know this comment may sound angry but I promise I'm not trying to be mad. And seriously, tell me more reasons why it's bad and why cliche is bad. Honestly I'm not that good of a movie analyzer (yes I know, the above is me analyzing the movie, but that stuff is obvious) so I just want to understand all the hate."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"what do you think the parent 😒 emojis orgasm faces look like?
 since they must have had sex to conceive their child 😒 emoji
how does childbirth work in the emoji universe? they have no visible genitalia that can be seen and the size of their mouths leaves little room for a womb capable of growing a child with a head that size

do they lay eggs? What about the non-smiley emojis that make up the majority of the emojidex that are just inanimate objects like footballs and buildings and flags, do they reproduce the same way as the smileys do?

What happens if two different emoji have a child together like would the offspring of a 🙂 and a 🙁 balance out to a 😐 or would it only carry the traits of one of its parents? Is inter-emoji breeding even accepted or is it frowned upon by society, thus bringing real-world racial allegories into this cartoon movie about talking piles of poop and eggplant jokes? The fact that our hero 😒 emoji’s parents are BOTH also 😒 emojis seems to point towards the latter"

_____ (main character) doesn't fit in/ is different. There's a consequence of being unique in ____'s world. ____ goes on a quest/adventure. Along the way, _____ finds love interest that gets in the way. There's a problem between characters (usually the recurring conflict or antagonist. Then comes the climax... and everything is solved afterwards. The end.

r8pJt4dK_s4,Cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is why Sony should only stay in the gaming industry.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I now know why Wreck It Ralph 2 was pushed off 8 months. I bet this was really similar to that film and it had to be retooled. On another note, this thing is a pointless rip off. Sure it looks cute at parts but it's been done before. It almost literally scene by scene rips off a scene from Inside Out. It's too obvious and the audience isn't stupid. We want good films Sony. Films with decent stories and not the movies you went to see with your kid the past two years. I might be completely wrong though, we shall see."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I felt my IQ drop while watching this trailer
r8pJt4dK_s4,Still waiting for SONY to announce that this was all a joke and immediately get rid of it.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why?

r8pJt4dK_s4,"There's one thing I just don't understand, the most of Animation Studio's public are kids, and emojis are usually used by adults or teenagers, why make an emoji movie theme if the movie is for kids?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The only ""joke"" I laughed was ""We are number one"" reference."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"its pretty much the lego movie
1. a loser who is actually a hero

3. evil boss telling everyone what to do

r8pJt4dK_s4,Emojis are not that serious. Why make a big deal out of it? This doesn't need a movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,y tho
r8pJt4dK_s4,As someone who has never used an emoji before I am deeply interested in this movie. I trust it will be a gateway for me to understand these emojis and I look very much forward to viewing a humerous and delightful yet extremely educational movie.

HONESTLY.
This would be good. If it wasn't about EMOJIS.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Could you please include ""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"" in this movie?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why is this a movie? WTF. Next they are going to make a movie about fucking fidget spinners.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Authism intensifies
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is like real emojies. Unneeded
r8pJt4dK_s4,Imagine if Patrick Stewart died and the last movie he starred in was him voicing animated poop
r8pJt4dK_s4,"What's next?, a movie about Fidget Spinners or Memes?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,The hand sounds like... well I don't know who do you think?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"just when I thought nothing could be stupider than sing or minions... boom this bullshit is introduced and it makes me want to turn inside out and kill myself bc there is no plot and the entire movie will ruin the emoji. way to go sony, your movies are getting shittier each year and won't get better ever"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Look who just sent me a text! What should I say?""

Well, you could try putting down your fucking phone and having a real conversation with them."
r8pJt4dK_s4,The only thing that was somewhat funny in this trailer was the hand. That's it.
r8pJt4dK_s4,lol i just realized 45k dislikes and 9k likes. YOU'LL REGRET THIS SONY!! WE WON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOUR NEXT MOVIE IS ABOUT FIDGET SPINNERS!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,it's like Sing! took a dump on Inside Out....
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Welcome to a world inside your phone""

r8pJt4dK_s4,what they could do at least is add sexual sun and molesting moon

They could have done anything else and would have been so much better .. like a movie about a group of humans who lives in a world dominated by evil dragons and an elite class of half dragons, and the god of humanity suddenly gives them  a prophecy to travel to certain place to be free of the Dragons cuz X dumb deus ex Machina, so the movie follows the leader or a group of leaders of humanity making the travel, culminating with an epic fight against one of the dragons, with maybe one or two of the group dying sacrificing themselves. A little alike the Jews escaping the egyptians. 
I thought that plot in what 5 minutes ? and it's way better than this movie. We have practically infinite potential to make epics about heroes facing impossible odds, and instead we make a movie about an emoji who's drama is that he cannot make a face for five seconds cuz it's his fucking job ....."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Toot Toot ! Here comes the hate train.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Take your time to read this comen since comment. 

As stated in the trailer, Addy McAllister sent Alex a message. But in another trailer, Alex's friend tells him to play it cool and send her an emoji. And what emoji does he use to ""play it cool""? You got it, a freaking Meh 😒. We also see that the meh emoji made the wrong face. And then later Alex says to his friend "" I gotta get this phone fixed"" and how does he fix it? By deleting his phone as said by the smiley face girl when she is interrogating the meh in a room. Alex COULD'VE pressed a wrong button and sent the wrong emoji to her, but Alex assumes that the meh just glitched out. We all in our lives have mistaken a word or emoji for another. So he must have cancer like us after seeing this trailer"

r8pJt4dK_s4,no
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I don't see much of a point in joining in to massacre the dead horse of how awful this looks...but what the hell. This is a soulless, creatively bankrupt idea for a film and everyone involved in greenlighting it should be ashamed."
r8pJt4dK_s4,this video makes me wanna use all my emojis
r8pJt4dK_s4,Dit wordt een van mijn favorite films
r8pJt4dK_s4,Thank you creator of this video for advertising my bleach bar! Topaz's bleach bar bleach and other poisonous foods and drinks! The perfect way to commit suicide!  We are not responsible for death serious injury loss of brain cells and bubble wrap.
r8pJt4dK_s4,haters *BACK OFF*
r8pJt4dK_s4,You've gotta be kidding me.
r8pJt4dK_s4,wow I think this is such a great movie this generation is definitely not getting dumber and dumber.......I mean look at all the other movies they make I just can't wait for the fidget spinner movie where they spin a fidget spinner for 2 hours!!!!!!(I'm just saying this to see my hateful replies)
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂🤣🤣☺️😂☺️🤣😂☺️😄🙃🙃🤣🙃☺️🤣🙂🙃☺️🤣🤣🖕🏿
r8pJt4dK_s4,Inside Out
r8pJt4dK_s4,do you think god cares about us? do you think if he's real he would help us? well i think god is dead and money whores have taken over
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Came here bc of jacksfilms's fam squad, squad fam"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is pandering to our generation to a whole new level.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Ya know this idea actually has the potential to be done well and creatively. It's a shame the studio appears to be giving a rather lazy attempt at the concept.
r8pJt4dK_s4,God has forsaken us
r8pJt4dK_s4,Disgusting trailer
r8pJt4dK_s4,It hurts to watch. Good thing that's something I wanted this movie to do.
r8pJt4dK_s4,🖕🏿
r8pJt4dK_s4,I give this movie the thumbs down emoji
r8pJt4dK_s4,The eggplant is in the room dedicated to the unpopular emoji's that don't get used often WTF 🍆💦👄 probably used a Thousand time a hour.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I hoped this would surprise me after that last trailer...
And boy was I right
But I thought it would be surprisingly good
That's where I was wrong
Just by seeing this I couldn't even get a clear idea of the story or the plot
But maybe I'll watch it when it's on one of those crap movie channels like crackle or tubitv and doesn't cost me money 
I'm curios, but not curious enough to blow $10 on a ticket or $5 to rent it when it's on VOD
Or even $1-$2 to buy a used DVD a few months after that's released
But I would consider it if it was free"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This should be the last day challenge for blue whale
r8pJt4dK_s4,The Crippling depression movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,Finally a movie that kill all the idiots slowly and painfully
r8pJt4dK_s4,"1:09 Uhhh, the eggplant...?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Could you please include ""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"" in this movie?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,only 44 K dislikes come-on guys you can do better

r8pJt4dK_s4,piece of crap; the movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,You cancelled popeye for this?! I don't know what and how to feel?
r8pJt4dK_s4,A HIP and RAD movie made by some old guys who are with the times
r8pJt4dK_s4,inside out + wreck it ralph + the lego movie + something no one asked for = emoji movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,its not a bad quality movie its just the worst idea ever
r8pJt4dK_s4,**execute Order 66**
r8pJt4dK_s4,delet this
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I give that movie two thumbs down. Eh eh eh. Wreck it Ralph, meet inside out, meets Oscar the grouches house.( Garbage)"
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂🔫
r8pJt4dK_s4,What about the middle finger emoji? Huh?
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is the company that thought the ghostbusters reboot would be good
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I can't believe they thought this was a good idea over the Popeye movie. It's so bad, and the trailer's not even HD"
r8pJt4dK_s4,you shouldve given up once your first one didnt succeed
r8pJt4dK_s4,this movie is ripping off Lego Movie inside
r8pJt4dK_s4,Kind of looks like the movie Inside Out.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Everyday we stray further and further away from god
r8pJt4dK_s4,Probably the worst concept for a movie ever
r8pJt4dK_s4,The like to dislike ratio finally gives me hope in humanity.!
r8pJt4dK_s4,My dad should have pulled out.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I want to die this is to cringey
r8pJt4dK_s4,"sony: hey lets create a movie where an emoji must make the right face so a 12 year old boy can flirt with a girl for 6 months then forget about her

colombia: I LOVE IT! first world problems for the win!!!!!!!!!!! yeah!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,cool
r8pJt4dK_s4,Whats the song 1:12?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Please tell me This is just a Fake Trailer
r8pJt4dK_s4,vine buscando mierda y encontre todo el drenaje
r8pJt4dK_s4,"They dragged poor Stephen Wright into this, didn't they?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Hey can I copy your homework? 
Yeah just change it up a lil bit.
Inside Out....The Emoji Movie"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Exegutor
r8pJt4dK_s4,Eggs
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is just a shitty mix of wreck it ralph and the lego movie

r8pJt4dK_s4,Wow i hate my birthday now and i feel bad for Thomas Fischbach birthday too... WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN POPEYE 😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
r8pJt4dK_s4,"So what this movie is saying is that if a phone gets broken all emojis die with it? 







**GRABS HAMMER AND SMASHES PHONE**"
r8pJt4dK_s4,You know what drinking  Bleach sounds better than. Whatching this Movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,The eggplant emoji gets used a lot tho

r8pJt4dK_s4,stop
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Patrick Stewart, you're better than this. You have style and class. You shouldn't even be here."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"People are upset because Illumination, Sony, and possibly Dreamworks (which was bought by the owner of Illumination) could possibly be setting a trend in animated movies that is for the worse. Instead of creating movies that are thought provoking, beautiful, and have smart humor, these companies are turning to trends and relying on them for their movies rather than trying to create something timeless, which actually takes a lot of time and effort to do.

I personally am scared for the future of animated movies, as movies like these ones may seem simple and harmless, but they're creating more money than companies that actually try to bring quality entertainment, such as Laika and Disney. Secret Life of Pets, which is basically a horrid fusion of Toy Story and animal videos on YouTube, made 233.3 million more than Disney's Moana.

If these companies continue to make mediocre movies that do well in the box office, it's possible that the quality stories and actual effort we see in some animated movies today will completely relinquish, and these movies will rule over the animated movie genre. 

There is no heart put in to this film, the character designs took no effort at all because they're based on emojis, and the only reason it's being made is because emojis are what are ""trendy"" with the kids these days. Please, give us quality stories."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Hollywood producer : Hey you got and ideas for a new movie?

r8pJt4dK_s4,"People experience emotional and mental health crises in response to a wide range of situations—from difficulties in their personal relationships to the loss of a job. For Veterans, these crises can be heightened by their experiences during military service. When emotional issues reach a crisis point, it’s time to call on the Veterans Crisis Line for support.

Sometimes a crisis may involve thoughts of suicide. Learn to recognize these warning signs:

Hopelessness, feeling like there’s no way out
Anxiety, agitation, sleeplessness, or mood swings
Feeling like there is no reason to live
Rage or anger
Engaging in risky activities without thinking
Increasing alcohol or drug abuse
Withdrawing from family and friends
The following signs require immediate attention:

Thinking about hurting or killing yourself
Looking for ways to kill yourself
Talking about death, dying, or suicide
Self-destructive behavior such as drug abuse, weapons, etc.
If you are a Veteran or know a Veteran who is experiencing any of these signs, call the Veterans Crisis Line immediately. Responders are standing by to help.

You can also learn to identify and understand risk factors for suicide.

Identifying the Signs

Many Veterans may not show any signs of intent to harm themselves before doing so, but some actions can be a sign that a Veteran needs help. Veterans in crisis may show behaviors that indicate a risk of harming themselves.

Learn more about how you can identify additional signs of suicide risk.

Take a Self-Check Quiz

Crisis, stress, depression, and other issues affect people in different ways. Maybe you’re having trouble sleeping or feel out of control. Maybe your energy level is down or you feel anxious all the time. If these issues and others seem to be leading to a crisis, treatment can help. Take a confidential, anonymous risk assessment to see how you might benefit from VA or community-based services."

I can't seem to find myself again
My walls are closing in

r8pJt4dK_s4,"We could have gotten a Popeye movie, but they canned it for this pandering trash. Shame."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The last time they used Don't Bring Me Down in a trailer was Jack and Jill and wouldnt you know it it was also from Sony. Piss off, Hollywood."

r8pJt4dK_s4,Why does this blue haired emo(..?)  emoji look so much like Cloe from life is strange? x.x  How dare they use such a char for duch a shitty movie X.X
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Okay, but setting aside the fact that this movie seems terrible....Why is the eggplant emoji considered not used?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why are people saying this is a ripoff of Inside out? It clearly isnt...Its a ripoff of Wreck it Ralph.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The hate for the movie is completely uncalled for. The movie hasn't come out yet, and the only problem with the movie that's been called out is that it is cringe.

 I dont see too much wrong with the plot, and for a kids animated movie, it even has a nice theme. So could anyone explain to me (intelligently) What the issue with the plot or the actual movie is?

 This hate is the exact same hate that was directed towards COD Infinite Warfare. Both the movie and the game had hate from people hopping on the wagon and also because they were ""cringe"", even though in my opinion they were, and are."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I WANT TO DIE

r8pJt4dK_s4,wtf sony
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie has completely destroyed my step fathers bakery. One of his employees thought it would be a good idea to make short bread cookies with the main character and the blue haired one on them. I'm crying at this discovery and I wanna burn the bakery down.
r8pJt4dK_s4,why so much hate
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is like a ripoff of Inside Out. I mean, I do want to see it but really? I mean this is a total ripoff of Inside Out."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Even after that first trailer, Sony is dumb enough to get even more hate."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"WHY DID SONY CANCEL POPEYE
FOR THIS?!!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Keep in mind everybody: A Popeye animated movie was canceled for this to-be-bombed movie. Why do you do this Sony?
r8pJt4dK_s4,The eggplant emoji gets used a lot though
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is going to be so lit I cannot wait
r8pJt4dK_s4,Where's the middle finger emoji 🖕 😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,😐🎥=💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is just proof Sony is based off numbers and not what people rely want.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This film already ripped off *INSIDE OUT* and *WRECK IT RALPH*
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The most ridiculous part of this, honestly, is the idea that the eggplant emoji never gets used."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is why Sony cannot make movies
r8pJt4dK_s4,i'm atheist now
r8pJt4dK_s4,i think it looks good
r8pJt4dK_s4,if no one sees this movie it might get cancelled yeah!!!!😀😀😀😀😀
r8pJt4dK_s4,My best friend's mom actually thinks this movie looks good.
r8pJt4dK_s4,At least this trailer ain't cringy af as in the first trailer
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I don't understand why are there so much dislikes. I mean, it's not the best film, but let's be honest, we seen worst... And actually to me, it seems pretty normal... Guys, they just made a little film about something new, popular in our days. Not need to act like hungry wolfs that just waiting to put a hate comment and start to dislike the movie even before the movie even SEEN!!! So please, the creators work really hard on it, don't be an assholes. Wait until the movie will come... I am totally going on that movie..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The emojis that are never ""use"" are the one are use the most. And the eggplant was one of them lol..."

Everyone hates this movie, so everyone's gonna be talking about it, so it'll be a commercial success; regardless of ratings, of course. It's budget will likely be minimal anyway."
r8pJt4dK_s4,The ultimate definition of Cringe in 2 minutes.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm glad they did not deactivate comments
r8pJt4dK_s4,Hopefully the creators will see all the dislikes and pull the film.

r8pJt4dK_s4,End me.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I guess the latest market research testing showed that people are finally stupid enough for the Emoji Movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Funny they could use the movie budget for cancer research but instead spreads like a wild fire
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The only part I like is the reference to ""bye felicia"" :P
The main plot of ""your ok the way you are"" is way too cliche, and making a movie about emojis...really? Making a short about it wouldn't be bad, but making a whole movie about it is just plain stupid,.."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"like a bad cross between wreck it Ralph, inside out and the Lego movie ;_; why Sony"

Why are you guys prostituting yourselves with releasing garbage like this, are you that desperate? What on earth is wrong with your studio heads, your producers, your employees? Did the Writers Guild's threats make you complacent? Are you people that blind to be unable to see what a horrible investment this garbage is? Even your marketing and promotion campaign sucks, absolute degeneracy; the concept is a rip off of plots that have already rotted (Wreck it Ralph, Toy Story, etc). This is vomit; regurgitations from the sickly old prostitute that is Hollywood. How sad. Actually, not sad, just disappointing.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Well, I gotta give my honest review to this trailer.

The story is about Gene (T.J. Miller) an emoji that is supposed to be a ""meh"", but can't control his emotions. Not that interesting, still some people might like it.

Honestly, it's a visually good looking trailer. I like the firewall reference, and the candy crush one, it basically has lots of phone (And PC) references.

Look, I know it took a long time to make this movie, and so many talented people are in it, but it really isn't interesting."

r8pJt4dK_s4,🤡🤖👵👁👀🗣👤✈️🚈🚉🚁🚆🚇🚂🚉👩🏾👨👲👴👳👳‍♀️
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Here's my list of complaints about this trailer:
1. It even exists.
2. This is literally just Wreck it Ralph. A character who has to play a specific role but wants to be more and ends up messing stuff up and going on an adventure with his friends.
3. 0:32 This freaking unfunny joke.
4. 1:02 This freaking hipster girl is wearing a winter scarf on a perfectly sunny day.
5. 1:15 What the heck kind of emoji is that. Bright hair beanie emoji? The heck is with that stupid pixel skull thing on it. 
6. The fact that this exists.
7. 1:20 A reference to an outdated meme. The creators seem to not realize that memes these days have very short life spans. Back in the mid 2000s, memes had very long life spans. Things like CDi cutscenes, Pepe the frog, those poorly drawn faces made to represent emotion, etc. Those were made at a time before things like ""Behind the Meme,"" a channel which tries to introduce Normies to meme culture, but by doing that, makes memes have way shorter life spans, from 2 weeks to, at most, 2 months. 'Bye Felicia' may have been relevant when the script was made, but due to the creators' lack of knowledge on meme life spans, the movie is outdated before its even released. Imagine 20 years from now, the new generation wouldn't have a freaking clue what 'bye felicia' is. Sorry for going on this giant rant on meme life spans, but that scene made me genuinely want to punch a wall from how stupid it was.
8. 1:30 Making us endure 10 seconds of an unfunny joke.
9. The fact that the joke from number 8 will probably go on for longer than 10 seconds in the movie.
10. The fact that this exists for the third time.
11. 1:41 Forced love story.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"am i

Is this real life

r8pJt4dK_s4,emojis are cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie hasn't even been released and it already flopped.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I'm not lying, this honestly, above anything else made me want the grab a wine glass and pour myself a fine glass of thick clorex bleach."
r8pJt4dK_s4,And I thought Flat Earth Activist would be the worse thing of 2017
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""does god stay in heaven because he too is afraid of what he has created?"""
r8pJt4dK_s4,"haha good one sony you missed april fools day by a month.

r8pJt4dK_s4,Oh my god he's 10 feet away from you talk to him in person.
r8pJt4dK_s4,fck is this shite?
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is literally Fucking wreck it Ralph except now it's with some autistic emoji. who's Fucking idea was this?
r8pJt4dK_s4,I've never been so happy in my life to kill myself.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Did they put the eggplant emoji in the ""never gets used club"""
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I thought they Fucking stopped making this movie,  what is this cancer and who birthed it."

r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony wtf
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I want to keep an open mind on this, but even the idea of it is so trashy. I'm pretty sure most of these emojis won't be used in the right context. Hope Sony doesn't bust too much if this ends up flopping."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm actually feeling suicidal now
r8pJt4dK_s4,"STOP!!! STOP!! THE TRAILER!!
Did these motherfuckers seriously put a ''Bye, Felicia'' joke in this move???
10 to 1 , the writers of this are past their 40's  and don't even understand the reference or won't use it in correct context.
Writer: Heard  my kid say this once,thats what all the hip cats are saying these days."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can tell this movie is going to be a failure.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Every day we stray further away from god
r8pJt4dK_s4,Emoji romance
r8pJt4dK_s4,We've failed as a species.
r8pJt4dK_s4,You suck Sony pictures!
r8pJt4dK_s4,i've never wanted to kill myself more
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie will be an EMOJInal roller coaster... I wunna die

r8pJt4dK_s4,"....




You guys traded a 3D Popeye movie for this?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Lol poop emoji , i like it a lot"
r8pJt4dK_s4,oh you fucked up this time Sony™
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This movie looks clishé and has bad humor, a losing combination"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I really want Sony to look at the likes to dislikes and reconsider this movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,Emoji=Ban
r8pJt4dK_s4,"quieres morirte, MIRA ESTE trailer
posdata si te gusto el trailer muérete le arias un gran favor a este mundo"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Oh christ... what is this world coming to?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why are we here... just to suffer
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is why I disabled emojis on my phone.
r8pJt4dK_s4,aids
r8pJt4dK_s4,that poop emoji is chocolate icecream
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Welcome to the Loser Lounge, where the emojis who never get used hang out.""
Oh so all of them?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Do you think God stays in Heaven because he too lives in fear of what he's created?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Emoji = Marik >:v #HailGrasa
r8pJt4dK_s4,Trying to think of a clever way to insult Sony but I think they already insulted themselves
r8pJt4dK_s4,"SOLO PAC-MAN!!!!!!!! >:v
#HailSDLG"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks dead good
r8pJt4dK_s4,Emoji = Ban
r8pJt4dK_s4,Ewrrrr The Fuckin Cringe Bro...
r8pJt4dK_s4,I have cancer now👍😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,We're reaching levels of generic that shouldn't even be possible!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"the ""🍆"" is actually very used👅👅💦"
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,why sony the worst movie ever.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks worse than I thought it would
r8pJt4dK_s4,"NOW, NOW, REMEMBER! THE LEGO MOVIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE WORTHLESS GARBAGE! So, just saying, there's still a chance this could be NOT the worst thing ever and be good instead. 

I mean I'm not saying it will be, I'm just saying there's a chance."
r8pJt4dK_s4,THIS MOVIE WILL HAVE AN EVEN WORST ROTTEN TOMATO VIEW THAN THE LAST AIR BENDER MOVIE!
r8pJt4dK_s4,I hope you payed TJ reasonably for this role. Such a cynical waste of time needs good compensation.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"ppl keep forgetting that these movies are made for CHILDREN, not grown adults who complain about EVERYTHING!  If you're not going to go see it, no one cares! There are plenty of kids who still like ""kid stuff"" that will be happy to go see it!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,this trailer is the brother of infinite warfare
r8pJt4dK_s4,THIS MOVE IS GONNA BE A TOTAL BUZZKILL!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Those 38k dislikers are adults and those 8k likers are kids like for example 7-13. As an 17 year old person, I really enjoyed the trailer and I think I'll enjoy the movie too! And the jokes were very funny! There are hidden jokes in this trailer that no one noticed! Like hack! For example, In 0:32 you can see a fart joke 🐘 💨  !! That's so funny and as you can see, the character laughed at that cause the character has more than one emotion! Understand the freaken jokes! It's funny and hilarious! And I also agree with youtuber jacksfilm who uploaded a video called ""frame by frame analysis of the emoji movie"". Plz watch that vid! You'll then change your mind and instead of disliking this trailer, you'll like this trailer! It has romance, action, comedy, and much more! And one more thing, this movie has a theme as well! So plz if your new don't dislike this for no reason, you should have a reason to dislike this. Not just saying ""I dislike this cause it's bad"". That's not gonna help! What's the bad thing, like, do you hate the animation? is the story bad? And also, give proof! Plz like this so all the people can see and understand!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,o no a emoji don't work let's delete my phone data and whith no sense  delete my sys32 from my pc
r8pJt4dK_s4,whoever came up with this was on acid

r8pJt4dK_s4,1:44 Blue whale
r8pJt4dK_s4,honestly if they showed more footage in the first video then this might of actually been good
r8pJt4dK_s4,Cancer.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Guys! What the heck! This movie looks awesome! I'm so going to see this at theaters! If you think this movie is bad, then check out a YouTuber called jacksfilms, he made a analysis about the emoji movie frame by frame. After that vid, you'll change your mind and start likening this movie trailer!!

I'm serious! Like, this is a kids movie! And as a 17 year old person, I enjoyed the trailer. Like come on, just understand the jokes, it's gonna be awesome! Just watch jacksfilms video, you'll understand what I meant."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"ok, it doesn't look as bad as I thought"
r8pJt4dK_s4,we need to stop
r8pJt4dK_s4,R. I. P Patrick Stewart

r8pJt4dK_s4,Lmao
r8pJt4dK_s4,Meh? More like BLERGH
r8pJt4dK_s4,i feel like their running out of ideas
r8pJt4dK_s4,"i can see the future and the future says ""people are going to see this movie unironically then the people who made it would have enough money to make a sequel and that would repeat itself until people realize that they're the reason these shitty movies keep getting made because they keep going to them"""

(Screw that🖕!!!)"
r8pJt4dK_s4,In all honesty I don't think it will be THAT bad
r8pJt4dK_s4,"It's sad to see how scared people are of liking and being a part of mainstream culture. Fighting it to maintain being special. Sad, sad people. Really, if your integrity can't survive liking something mainstream, it's not the mainstream things that are the problem. Sorry about it."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I don't know what I find funnier. The fact someone pitched this idea or the fact someone listened to this and thought it'd be a good idea
r8pJt4dK_s4,"8,064 people turned their phones upside down and disliked it again."
r8pJt4dK_s4,i have to admit that this is even better than the rubbish teaser
r8pJt4dK_s4,🐘💨
r8pJt4dK_s4,well. I disliked the teaser trailer a while ago. but it looks ok. I still don't want it to happen though.

r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is going to be so dull and I can already tell almost all the characters will just have one personality trait to fit the emoji theme
r8pJt4dK_s4,All I'm waiting for now is Farmville to premier onto the big screen.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is pretty much the epitome of the phrase ""Hollywood has run out of ideas"""

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Is it just me, or is it basically the Lego movie but with emojis instead?
I mean:
-they have a system where everyone has one emotion (Lego movie: everyone has to follow instructions)
-there's a protagonist with coloured hair (Lego movie: Wildstyle)
-there are evil robots with red eyes intent on keeping order
-Finally, the main protagonist is trying to fit into society, they should've just got Chris Pratt to play that part"

r8pJt4dK_s4,yare yare daze :v
r8pJt4dK_s4,delete this >:v
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is this a joke?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This movie seems so... I don't how to put it... cliahe? It's seems like a mix of Inside Out and Reck It Ralph.But I mean just by watching the trailer I feel like I already know what's going to happen. The ""meh"" emoji is going to on an adventure with the girl and he is going to learn that he should have more than one emotion.Then,everyone gets in on this and this whole movie is about being yourself. I mean I just wish people would be more unqiue when making making some kids movies. I mean some kid movies are really good.But this movie just feels like everything I have already saw from a kids movie."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I can't name the meh voice, but I hope this will be the end of the actors career. I could care less if it was some kind of contract. he deserves to lose his job. anybody who was involved in this movie is worthless. ALSO, DID THEY SERIOUSLY USE ""CANT BRING ME DOWN""?! SCREW EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. SCREW ANYBODY WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS MOVIE. this movie is one of the five horsemen of the apocalypse. I pray that it's the fifth. this movie is literally cancer. if you replaced every emoji with a grotesque, pus-squirting, bloody tumor, it could only be an improvement. I want to ban emojis. this is even worse than merriam-Webster changing literally so you can use it as practically. this movie has made me hate Sony so much, I'm gonna go stick my penis in an xbox. I hope this movie bombs harder than Nagasaki."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Dat Boii says no plz delete it
r8pJt4dK_s4,"i want to die, seriously why did they came with this idea? are the braindead?"

r8pJt4dK_s4,What even is the girl emoji? Emo?
r8pJt4dK_s4,What song plays half way through it ?

r8pJt4dK_s4,"I find it very strange that there are big names attached to this movie along with the fact that Sony is really banking on it's success when it already has a pretty negative view from most people. Something really weird is going on, obviously I know the movie will be dumb, but I find it so strange they think it will be a success."
r8pJt4dK_s4,and when i think they cant come with more absurd idea i see this
r8pJt4dK_s4,I think they misspelled cancer

r8pJt4dK_s4,"I'm laughing so hard








at the dislikes"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This trailer gave me 69 types of aids
r8pJt4dK_s4,me me big boy
r8pJt4dK_s4,dashie:....tina
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Again, Popeye movie got cancelled for this..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks like the plot for wreck it ralph
r8pJt4dK_s4,Of all ungodly things that could have a Coke about on my birthday
r8pJt4dK_s4,oh COME ON! Even a movie about 2009 memes would be more entertaining than THIS! You are seriously running out of ideas Sony.
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is the beginning of the end
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I Hope This Movie Is A Box Office Flop Like Ghostbusters, Even That Is Unlikely"
r8pJt4dK_s4,😑🔫 good bye world
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's such a shame that cancer has affected so many that it is now evolving into films like this
r8pJt4dK_s4,The thing that amazes me the most is that Patrick Stewart is in this movie. SIR PATRICK STEWART IS VOICING A POOP EMOJI. GOD IS DEAD.
r8pJt4dK_s4,When it's April 2nd but the emoji movie still exists.
r8pJt4dK_s4,When it's April 2nd but the emoji movie still exists.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Really? I just think Sony ran out of ideas of a decent movie as all the other ones were taken. Is this just because emojis are used all the time? I mean, I hardly ever use them, it would've been better if they did stuff like le Lenny Face or a movie about memes. That would be more liked and more creative to others. I'm just laughing at the spicy like to dislike ratio. I doubt this movie is going to be that successful to be honest. The people who really like this movie idea are pretty sad if info say so myself."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"the egg plant emoji never gets used?


sony doesn't even do research,i bet they also can't neck themselves properly."
r8pJt4dK_s4,2:21 am i the only noticing that the Emoji that wants to kill himself because of this is behind Patrick Stewarts' bathroom door?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh look, Sony wants to make Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out without all of the originality, clever humor, and interesting characters. Great, a two-for-one ripoff special."
r8pJt4dK_s4,well... it's better than the first trailer...
r8pJt4dK_s4,the only thing that is funny about this is the like to dislike ratio
r8pJt4dK_s4,"That voice actor...
Sounds like like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Oh dear...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Anyone else think this is a ripoff of Lego Movie, except a generic kids movie?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I hope it features the middle finger emoji because this is the biggest middle finger from Sony pictures animation 😂🖕
r8pJt4dK_s4,Someone please fucking Columbine Sony Pictures Animations for ever releasing this monstrosity
r8pJt4dK_s4,Just stop
r8pJt4dK_s4,rip Popeye
r8pJt4dK_s4,From the people who brought you the beautifully animated cloudy with a chance of meatballs bring you: The emoggle move
r8pJt4dK_s4,es por eso que los extraterrestres no nos visitan >:v
r8pJt4dK_s4,Who says 🍆 doesn't get used
r8pJt4dK_s4,So it's just toy story? And reck it Ralph? And boss baby? What if DVD players had secret lives? That should be a film!
r8pJt4dK_s4,The thing is this film looks the kind of film I would watch just to make fun of it but then walk out of the cinema thinking it wasn't that bad
r8pJt4dK_s4,Im gonna watch this just to take the piss out of it
r8pJt4dK_s4,JAMES CORDEN
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The poop emojis don't wash their hands because they would soften too much and dilude with the water.

*D E E P E S T  L O R E*"
r8pJt4dK_s4,please dont
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is the reason humanity is never visited by other beigns
r8pJt4dK_s4,en lo que internet nos ha convertido... cada vez mas idiota
r8pJt4dK_s4,well there goes the last piece of human logic on this planet...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Good lord,the character design look worse each time they show new footage! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Cancer .
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sausage Party + Inside out + (add a little dash of cancer) = we have a Emoji movie....
r8pJt4dK_s4,w h y
r8pJt4dK_s4,Take the cancer out this movie you won't have the movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,1:49 I remember when No Man's Sky ruined my party too..
r8pJt4dK_s4,I need to watch this movie ☺☺☺
r8pJt4dK_s4,CANCER AUTISM AND CRINGE IN ONE
r8pJt4dK_s4,Popeye was canceled for this...
r8pJt4dK_s4,the autism
r8pJt4dK_s4,is will be good i don't know y the hate
r8pJt4dK_s4,"At the first glance, this is emoji. On the second thought, this is Orwell."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"TLDW it's wreck-it ralph with emoji's
no really it's almost the exact same plot"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Oh no...
r8pJt4dK_s4,At the this moment sony realize they fucked up 😂👍
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Clearly written by some old business guy. Same cliche plot that was basically given to you by a majority of Hollywood movies, along with the best jokes, in  2 and a half minutes. This movie will age like a banana, and within 5 years, it will be sitting at the bottom of a Walmart Bargain bin for $2.00. Now that's what I call ""a good movie."""
r8pJt4dK_s4,Thats the reason why school shooting exists!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Of course Candy Crush is in this movie, King is the EA of mobile gaming so no wonder they teamed with Sony the king of product placement"
r8pJt4dK_s4,this movie (👎🔫😡😢)
r8pJt4dK_s4,Moist
r8pJt4dK_s4,Just fukn no!!!! It's too cringe for me.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can just tell the creators of this movie are giving us the middle finger emoji...
r8pJt4dK_s4,😈😀😀😀😊😡😠😑😅😅😅😂😃😘😸😻😽👯💅👻👀🎀🎄🎠🐴🐴🐴🐴
r8pJt4dK_s4,I love how the eggplant is part of the losers lounge even though it's used all the time
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me and my girlfriend do the dance with no pants for this movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,Free cancer gor everyone
r8pJt4dK_s4,Yep. It's happening.
r8pJt4dK_s4,why has this happened to us...
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie gave me crippling depression
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is the movie that will start another great depression
r8pJt4dK_s4,the dislike bar is the funniest thing about this trailer haha
r8pJt4dK_s4,People are over reacting as usual.
r8pJt4dK_s4,WTF have you done Sony?
r8pJt4dK_s4,😑🔫
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Guys, this gonna be a modern day classic"
r8pJt4dK_s4,why make this crap
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is rape
r8pJt4dK_s4,comedy in its highest and purest form
r8pJt4dK_s4,WHY?
r8pJt4dK_s4,ew
r8pJt4dK_s4,The concept seemed ludicrous initially but this actually doesn't seem half bad considering it's a film about emojis. It has a story and some charm with it. Has a similar Wreck-It Ralph vibe. Too many cynical people on here who probably downvoted the trailer before even watching it. Stop taking a kids film so seriously.
r8pJt4dK_s4,looks like 💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,i want to die
r8pJt4dK_s4,😒 meh
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Normies have taken over the movie industry.

because casually destroying a few memes wasn't enough.... now they got to destroy emoji."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I wish this wasn't real.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Jesus christ kill me
r8pJt4dK_s4,"(  •_•)

But I Like Emojis"
r8pJt4dK_s4,🤥 I want to see this emoji so badly
r8pJt4dK_s4,whoever made this should be put to death
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh boy... what a birthday present....




heh..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sorry did I just see 🍆 in the room for emojis that never get used
r8pJt4dK_s4,sign of the times ?
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂👌🔥🔥💯💯
r8pJt4dK_s4,Molester Moon better be in this
r8pJt4dK_s4,Film about Emoji's? the world is ready for destroy
r8pJt4dK_s4,Where's the middle finger emoji?
r8pJt4dK_s4,its frustrating that such a shitty movie has such beautiful animation
r8pJt4dK_s4,why does the 'obligatory emo girl character' emoji look like the lesbean from life is strange
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Three words:
*END*
*OF*
*HUMANITY*"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is the end of the world
r8pJt4dK_s4,The cringe is fuckin real.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Patrick Stewart is the voice of the poo
r8pJt4dK_s4,"my god,,, its the best movie ever, even better than phantom menace and thats saying something"
r8pJt4dK_s4,what.
r8pJt4dK_s4,remake of reck it ralph
r8pJt4dK_s4,HAHAHAHAHAH i gotta see this lol
r8pJt4dK_s4,i have truely lost all hope for humanity. this kind of evil should not exist
r8pJt4dK_s4,The only good thing about this is the animation. It's a bit of a shame.
r8pJt4dK_s4,why so much dislike there are a silly people
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's like a Wreck It Ralph and Tangled rip-off
r8pJt4dK_s4,"1980: ""I bet there's flying cars in the future!""
2017: *emoji movie*"
r8pJt4dK_s4,🐘💨   This is comedy
r8pJt4dK_s4,If they weren't emojis this movie would be a good wreck it Ralph spin off
r8pJt4dK_s4,"God help us, we're doomed as a species."
r8pJt4dK_s4,why
r8pJt4dK_s4,🖕
r8pJt4dK_s4,Nope
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is stupid delete video movie is pointless
r8pJt4dK_s4,Instead of giving the girl text why not just talk to her
r8pJt4dK_s4,The moment you lose all hope in humanity
r8pJt4dK_s4,I really hate the idea of the Emoji Movie but that reference to Lazy Town in the end killed me
r8pJt4dK_s4,Emo emoji?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Emoji movie... what's next? The keyboard movie?
r8pJt4dK_s4,I guess you could say that girl is an EMOji..... k ill let myself out
r8pJt4dK_s4,"sidenote why is the eggplant emoji in the loser lounge, it's like notorious"
r8pJt4dK_s4,1% would see this behemoth of an emoji.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Wait, is ""we are number 2"" a we are number one meme?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,James Corden!!!

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Electric Light Orchestra, seriously? Good record in a trailer of shitty movie."
r8pJt4dK_s4,so aids
r8pJt4dK_s4,"All I can say bout this movie is that it looks like trash, but the part where that ""Meh"" guy says ""Maybe I was ment to have more than one emotion."" really hits me, in my opinion, it's sounds pretty wise, but anyways; back to the bad part, to me, the jokes i've seen so far look pretty weak, and fro, what I've seen, this movie acts too hip to kids, and feels like it's in that one catagory, that ONE catagory."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This cash grab is well, a cash grab."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Looks so bad

r8pJt4dK_s4,"this seems like wreck it ralph except for the part where they do something unique with the ""be yourself"" idea, and they're instead going in a more generic direction. 

also, the fact that the subject matter is a new and trendy piece of iconography, as opposed to a more established piece of pop culture like video games, just makes the whole thing feel cynical and insincere. 

imma give Wreck It Ripoff 3/10"
r8pJt4dK_s4,quit disliking a trailer that looks decent before watching the movie!!! this is like Inside Out...looks good!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,Even a meme movie would be better than this trash.

r8pJt4dK_s4,😒

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Please Sony, just cancel this please."
r8pJt4dK_s4,this makes me want to slit my wrist with a 1000 degree knife and did they really fucking say BYE FELICIA?????

r8pJt4dK_s4,emoji keyboard
r8pJt4dK_s4,yo vine por un momo :v
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This movie can at least be completely terrible or it could be ok because it's audience is based around kids so of course we would criticize against this movie so remember this is a kids movie it could still be a good movie...

r8pJt4dK_s4,I think this movie is gonna be pulled off theaters
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is what they gave up the Popeye movie for, everybody. 

This is what we get instead."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Just stick it strait to DVD/Blu-Ray and move on Sony. Don't even try and cash this bouncer.
r8pJt4dK_s4,1 like on this comment = 1 grim reaper kills one emoji in there sleep at 3:00 AM
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is a ripoff of Wreck Ralph
r8pJt4dK_s4,my god. why not i guess
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh dear Sony, first Femi-Busters now this. Someone's not done their market research again. =P

Stick to making phones and PlayStation's. "
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's sad what qualifies as entertainment nowadays.

r8pJt4dK_s4,man hollywood is a crazy place...
r8pJt4dK_s4,There's a fucking product product placement in here?  For fucks sake.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Stop it Sony
r8pJt4dK_s4,Realize that a group of people. Probably all adults. Sat down. And thought a movie based off of emojis was a good idea.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sometimes I wonder if we are ever getting any more advanced.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Rip off of Wreck it Ralph
r8pJt4dK_s4,it's so bad I have to watch it over and over again
r8pJt4dK_s4,Okay we all know the eggplant emoji does get used often...more often then it should
r8pJt4dK_s4,32.000 dislikes and 6.000 likes...whooofffff
r8pJt4dK_s4,Thought the first trailer was a joke..
r8pJt4dK_s4,"*Note the following* Plot is spoiled in 1:54 minutes of this trailer leaving you no reason to waste money on this trash. The main ""Hero's"" are Hero's in a childrens movie so they're going to succeed. You've now succesfully watched the movie. Please don't go to the movie for it and give the makers any money."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"to be honest, the animation itself is pretty good, but the idea of this movie is what causes problems"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The concept of the film is disgusting, but by the trailer i can see that the realization is not a complete disaster for the moment..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,oh wow this movie looks terribal it doesn't even have a well designed plot and the message seems kinda cliched
r8pJt4dK_s4,I want to die
r8pJt4dK_s4,meh
r8pJt4dK_s4,fuq sake
r8pJt4dK_s4,Meh.

r8pJt4dK_s4,The hell is wrong with society?
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's not even out and people are hating just give it a chance
r8pJt4dK_s4,😄+🎬=💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,"At least they're trying
But please don't put this in theatres you'll just embarrass yourselves Sony"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is an unexcusable sin. Please don't.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"1970: I bet there will be brilliant works of arts playing in the theater!

r8pJt4dK_s4,🖕
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The animation for this movie is pretty good, and I can see the message they're trying to teach."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Pros: the memes
Cons: the entire movie"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I only feel one emotion after watching this.
Disgust."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This trailer really made me think 🤔
r8pJt4dK_s4,LMFAO what has the world come to
r8pJt4dK_s4,the one thing good about this trash tralier wreck it taught ripoff is the music this is good for little kids because they don't know what emojis are yet soo it does not ruin emojis for them
r8pJt4dK_s4,bye Felicia
r8pJt4dK_s4,"To be honest why is everyone hopping on the bandwagon? Seriously I think the movie won't be that bad, yes i know they made it for money but still it has a good enough plot that would be cool to watch! Plus who knows maybe this movie will be funny and great? You know this is just a trailer"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why are there so many likes
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is someones legacy
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Whatever. just because it's probably not going to be any good, I'll still watch it on DVD. When they make a movie, they can't make us watch it, only give us a choice on whether we will or not. It either exists and almost nobody likes it, or it doesn't exist, and absolutely nobody likes it. To me, the benefits of it's existence slightly outweigh the benefits of it's none existence, so they might as well go on ahead with it. To those who hate it, they can just ignore it, causing the benefits of it's existence to be equal to the benefits to its non-existence, so it doesn't have to matter for them anyway. If I'm wrong, please reply with a well thought through comment that explains how this movie would be better off for you not existing than existing."
r8pJt4dK_s4,the main character sounds like a character from star vs the forces of evil
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Emoji's go on a cybernetic adventure and bang afterwards






The end"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I'm not sorry, but this is just a blatant rip off of Wreck It Ralph. Even if that wasn't the original intention, it just is for so many reasons."
r8pJt4dK_s4,FuckMarvel!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is it everybody, this is the end of culture. We lost."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I really hope that someone was fired because of this piece of garbage excuse of a movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,At least there's now a purpose
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The Emoji Movie, courtesy of retarded millennials"

r8pJt4dK_s4,No

r8pJt4dK_s4,Do you guys recruit your screenwriters from  Mexican day-labor lines?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Can we go back to historical epics again?
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie represents everything that's wrong with today's society.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Why would the eggplant emoji be in the Loser Lounge? 🍆🍆🍆😉👅💦
Also that shameless Candy Crush advertising sure is... there.
I mean, the very concept of the movie makes me cringe, but it's both sad and amusing to find out it's as bad as most of us expected after all."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"If people actually go see this movie to hate on it to make a video or even plan to watch it just because it's a movie....DONT. Don't watch this horrible trash. We're just paying Sony what they want.

STOP.

This ""want to fit in society"" plot line has been done thousands of times better in other movies.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Still insisting that we want this film huh, Sony?

I.. it just.. IT BEGGARS BELIEF.

_lads, our trailer got 80% dislikes and 90% of comments were negative - I think that means that they like it_

SPOILER ALERT: (week after movie release) The emoji movie bombed so hard at the box office, so therefore, IT WILL NOT BE A SUCCESS!!! 
but that's my spoiler guess."

Alternate scene
After the class, people gang up on him because he is playing candy crush and the class start to bully him. Over the next few weeks, they repeatedly bully him to the point that Ady mcalister doesn't even acknowledge him anymore. Eventually after one too many days of being beaten by the school bullies, Adam takes a nice walk to his uncle's house on the top of the hill, who isn't mad, but definitely thinks that the world will end with a weaponized pathogen sent over by the Soviet Union. After stealing a tec-9, he sneaks into class and begins to blow the brains out of everyone who teased him including Ady.When police searched his phone, all they found was a multitude of meh emojis sent to his family and friends."

r8pJt4dK_s4,you have 10 days.. you can still cancel it!
r8pJt4dK_s4,im pretty sure eggplant is used a lot
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Come on guys, cut the movie some slack, the story is as best as it can get, and people are trying their best to make it actually good. Don't you want to at least hope for the best? What if, it happens to be a decent movie? The cringe aspect of the whole setting will still exist, but at least they are trying to make it original and a little bit charming. Don't go into this movie with a mindset of trying to find the cringe, try to watch it from an actual storytelling and movie perspective. I am not trying to praise, I'm just saying put down the cringe for now, because we haven't seen the whole movie yet, and at least hope for a decent movie. If it's total cringe, then we can actually laugh, but right now it's not totally cringey. not without the fidget spinners."

r8pJt4dK_s4,No
r8pJt4dK_s4,The concept is like wreck-it ralph or osmosis jones if you took everything good out of it and then still found a way to make it worse. Or maybe like something on college humor that I watch to kill time on the loo. except real.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Eggplant emoji never gets used?...

r8pJt4dK_s4,I was happy to give this movie a chance until I saw the candy crush product placement. It doesn't need to be in there and is so terribly forced. I genuinely was going to stay optimistic until I saw it.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"After this movie, things can only get worse. The old, out of touch executives will continue in their desperate attempts to appeal to trending topics. The Minecraft movie is already slated for 2019. We can expect a Fidget Spinner movie, a Dab Movie. This will culminate with the death of the human race upon the release of the Meme Movie."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Emojis don't need to exist anyway, let alone a shitty film. Literally the only positive part of this is the voice acting/cast"

r8pJt4dK_s4,Le funny joke
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's very simple. You just aim the gun in the direction of your face and then you pull the trigger.

r8pJt4dK_s4,WW3 machine better be working
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks worse than my mum going diarrhea m8
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Ok obviously no, it doesn't look like a bad movie. BUT... what's the theme again? To ""just be yourself""? Don't we have enough movies as it is that display that message in one way or another? I mean that's not but the only reason people don't like this is the concept. Using emojis as characters... it's dumb. It's literally dumb, what's next are the ABC's going to go on an super verbticular adventure to find the importance of staying true to ones self? Everyone should understand that when making a movie (especially an animated one) from the makers perspective the possibilities are endless yet they didn't think to factor in how the majority of people who are actually looking forward to the next big movie (of any kind) would take this for what it is. As to quote Jurassic park: ""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" A.K.A: Where's My Pop-Eye?"

r8pJt4dK_s4,Excuse me while I go find some bleach...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I know Disney usually takes ideas from already created books / series / movies, but this whole trama smells like Wreck it Ralph and The Lego Movie. 
You could have done an HD version of an almost forgotten animation legend directed by one of the best writters and creative minds in animation from the last two decades, but ok, you're the ones with the money..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,What if aliens discover our planet and this movie is the only thing they find.

r8pJt4dK_s4,I haven't see the movie and i already feel cringe.
r8pJt4dK_s4,In what world is the eggplant one of the least used emojis?

r8pJt4dK_s4,There is a middle finger emoji...
r8pJt4dK_s4,Right. Ok. I'm off to go end my life.
r8pJt4dK_s4,i know it's cool to hate this but it's a good idea and it seems cute idk everyone's just saying it's stupid because it's about emojis which is part of the new generation technology and they're acting like mankind is doomed over a cute kids movie like chill it's not that bad

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Its literally going from one game to one they don't belong in, and that game is made entirely out of candy, and the overall premise is getting over the stereotypes and labels others put on you...

r8pJt4dK_s4,I don't get why everyone hates emojis? This is a film for kids you know it's a unique idea that will probably make them a lot of money. Or is it because emojis are popular and that's why people hate them?

r8pJt4dK_s4,🤢
r8pJt4dK_s4,You think we don't use the eggplant emoji?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"There are so many absolutely tremendous stories out there just WAITING to be animated, but nooooo, better go for plan B:
*fat, sweaty industry boss*: soo, what do those kids nowadays like? Is it still Garfield, rudeness, skateboards and this...rock and roll music?
*employee*: Sir, are you talking about Bubsy again? That was over two centuries ago and back then we learned that blunt and generic franchises which are obviously used to make money out of...
*fat, sweaty industry boss*: SHUT YOUR TRAP AND ANSWER ME, WHAT DO THEY LIKE NOWADAYS?!?
*employee*: ""sigh"", stories about believing in yourself, generic tomboy-ish love interests and emojis
*fat, sweaty industry boss*: Emo-cheese? I swear, these kids nowadays...fine, get some people and make a movie out of it
*employee*: wait, what?
*fat, sweaty industry boss*: You heard me, gosh-darnit! If the kids want Emo-cheese, we give em´ Emo-cheese! They´ll pay for it as they´ll always do! I´ve been doing this for YEARS, you rookie! Now go make that movie, Bobby!
*employee*: My name is Alexander.
*fat, sweaty industry boss*: BEGONE! ""intensive sweat-from-forehead-wiping""
*employee*: How is this my life..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"With all seriousness, let's take a moment to contemplate how long animation takes, and how long the animators worked on this, only to see it burn in the annals of history. The time, the effort, the artists, the screenwriters, the story boarders... I truly wish them well."
r8pJt4dK_s4,My eyes burns
r8pJt4dK_s4,Want more cringe? Read the description.

r8pJt4dK_s4,WHY U DO DIS
r8pJt4dK_s4,Inside Out and The Lego Movie but with neither the originality nor clever writing. From the good folks at Sony.

*Said noone ever*"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"You got to give the animators credit for great job on the visuals, but the un-relatable, corny jokes is unreal. Worst animation movie of all time?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,i kinda like it...
r8pJt4dK_s4,what the hell is this rubbish
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is this Inside Out but in a phone or something?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"So basically, this is another ""be who YOU want to be"" movie. This very theme is vital to all coming of age stories, but shouldn't be the CENTRAL theme of the story. This is the product of old people who are trying to be ""hip n' cool"", because of the fact that they have emoji and are advertising candy crush, which is basically like a dead game by now. People have moved on from that a long time ago. How disappointing. I am not even an adult and I can come up with WAY better ideas than this. But to let's honest, they don't care about making good movies, all they want is money. Look at their past movies last year, Ghostbusters? Angry Birds? The Spider Man movies, they were just cashgrab money garbage. I want to see something original, and risk-taking."
r8pJt4dK_s4,why tf was the eggplant in the loser lounge
r8pJt4dK_s4,"A random emoji it would be cool, not like woah the most amazing thing, but why people would found it bad?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,i hope nobody goes to see this. the budget for this film could have produced something else worthwhile. this makes me sad
r8pJt4dK_s4,bee movie but every time an e word is uttered the entirety of the emoji at 1/4 speed plays
r8pJt4dK_s4,Let's pass the record from ghost busters to this for the most disliked video on YouTube.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I thought this was cancelled...
r8pJt4dK_s4,*WHAT'S NEXT?!? THE FIDGET SPINNER MOVIE?!?*

Watch this without cringe"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"If one where to put The Lego Movie, Wreck-Raplh, and emojis into a blender and hit ""smoothie""...

You still would get a product that has more positive traits then this dumpster fire of a movie."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm not angry... I'm just disappointed...
r8pJt4dK_s4,The Autism Movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why is sombra in the movie?

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Wait a second, at the end of the trailer, did the poop emojis just use the bathroom?So what comes out of a......you know what I'm reading too deep into this."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This actually looks really good!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"they're deleting negative comments, aren't they."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Don't watch this. Just watch the Captain Underpants movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I actually felt physical pain upon seeing the Candy Crush part. The consumerism was so blatant and 'hip' it hurt :(
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Pls people do us one think together.
Don't watch it. I mean it. 
We hate this stupid Baby Boss movie and than it got a Hit. We should all ignore it."
r8pJt4dK_s4,EGGPLANT GETS USED LITERALLY ALL THE TIME
r8pJt4dK_s4,Wreck it Ralph?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Wow this movie looks great, and I'm sure this movie will be better than, Finding Nemo."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I want to spite this movie by watching it just to see how bad it is, but I won't because I have limited money, dignity, and I would be supporting this. I'll probably watch some bootleg. If (and likely so) people do this same method, this movie tank in box office and bootleggers would get a raise."
r8pJt4dK_s4,How is this even a thing?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Truly the death of humanity
r8pJt4dK_s4,I wanna die

r8pJt4dK_s4,Ah what a lovely waste of animation!✨👌👌
r8pJt4dK_s4,I think I predicted the death of the film industry...then again everyone here probably did as well

 No joy. 
No Passion.
Mankind had created this reality around themselves to cope with the empty oblivion that surrounded them. 
God does not exist, he is a placebo created by man to cope with their broken, mutilated morality. 
If a loving, caring benevolent God existed, why would he allow his creation to do this?

The concept is ridiculous off the top of the head but, if you think about it, there is soooo much to be done and this production looks promising. Also, it's gonna be a movie that makes fun of itself to be fun and I'm all for that. Just don't get what the hate's for when the creators literally know how farfetched the idea is which is what will make it so interesting and entertaining to see it done professionally."

r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is going to be literally the greatest thing ever created and if you disagree you must be a filthy emojiphobe. It's so sad that Sony keeps making brilliant diverse movies like Ghostbusters with an all female cast and now an Emilio movie with an all emoji cast. But our bigoted society keeps rejecting them. Welcome to Trumps America.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Wait.. so that's basically a rip-off of *The LEGO Movie*, *Inside Out*, *Wreck-It Ralph* and *Toy Story*?!"

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Not only is this a fucking emoji movie

But according to this movie the eggplant 🍆 is hardly ever used 

If your going to make a movie about emojis at least do it right"

r8pJt4dK_s4,Next there will be a movie about letters...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I bet at least 90% of the dislikes were clicked just because it's a movie about emojis.

Yes, this movie looks bad. But come on, it can't be worse than something like Norm of the North. At least it's well animated."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"And they cancelled the Popeye movie for this, sony just fucking stop"

r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is a disgrace. It has the same rubbish story line as terrible all movies. There's a person who doesn't know their purpose and there's another person who thinks person 1 is perfect. Then the 1st person goes on a fun fun fun quest to find out who they are. Of course they find out and live a happy life with person 2. What the hell has this world come to?! BUT KIDDIES WILL WATCH IT CAUSE U KNOW EMOJIS ARE COOL BECAUSE PHONES AND SOCIAL MEDIA IS COOL. SONY IS WRECKING KIDS MINDS PRAY 4 YO KIDZ

r8pJt4dK_s4,hi . plant anybody   watch worse  this video  lmar/ .
r8pJt4dK_s4,me me big disappointed
r8pJt4dK_s4,Coming soon - The Snapchat Filters Movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why do people hate this movie so much??
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is it guys. We have reached peak levels of stupidity.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sta mamada 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,Are you fucking serious
r8pJt4dK_s4,Everyday we stray further from god...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Ah yes! Such an amazing movie trailer, an original plot, idea, and story. I believe the character development and growth will be astounding, with our main character being ""The Chosen One"", who differentiates from the other Emojis. 0/10 movie, would dislike again."
r8pJt4dK_s4,this think is awful as hell
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony, if you make this movie, I'm seriously think of switching to Xbox."
r8pJt4dK_s4,What in the world did I just watch?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Disliked even before the video buffers.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Actually I kinda liked this. You can call me however you want - Satan, Santiago, idiot. I don't care. Lots of people hate this movie. So am I supposed to dislike the movie too? Of course no. All I see in this comment section is just the same thing, like ""can I kill myself now?"". If you can't accept other people opinions, then it's not my fault. (an example) Some people might like Volkswagen cars, some might not.  You just can't judge the movie by the trailer. It's like judging the book by it's cover. Maybe the movie will be good. Who knows. Keep in mind that it's just my opinion. (Before calling me a kid, I have to tell you that I'm 14, soon - 15.)"
r8pJt4dK_s4,when your only big movie of the summer is dislike bombed
r8pJt4dK_s4,We have already seen this kind of movie a billion times before. Please stop.

r8pJt4dK_s4,Civilizition is done everyone. It has been a great journey but I think this movie marks the end.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Disney: WOW! We made 400 million dollars at the box office from wreck it ralph and double of that with inside out

Warner Brothers: Hey, i made 400 million with our Lego Movie

Both: It would be terrible if another  studio combined all 3 films and based it on some new popular fad

Sony Pictures Animation: Hey Guys, if we do this equation (Wreck-It-Ralph+The Lego Movie+ Inside Out+Something Popular), it will completly kill our reputation as an animation studio

Executive: Who cares, it was already ruined by Hotel Translyvania And the Smurfs movies, but will just make our reputation as worse as Blue Sky is now with the Ice Age Movies by still making money trying to be hip with the kids

And that is why this movie was made and why it deserves to be cancelled "
r8pJt4dK_s4,inside out 2 looks great.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Why did they have to use ELO, why drag Jeff Lynne into this....."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Ghastly.  Uninspired.  Destined to age poorly.  Look at something like the Lego movie.  That movie has references that will date it, but it will never become completely inaccessible.  This POS is already on the way to being horribly dated and it isn't even out yet."

r8pJt4dK_s4,People who want to see this movie unironically are the reason we have a shitty Ghostbusters remake...
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie feels like Tearjerker's (Roger American Dad) plot where he releases purposely bad movies so that everyone will watch the one serious movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,"You never know, the movie might actually be good. The idea behind it is terrible, but how they execute it might change the movie itself.
I mean, a movie about emojis."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"It's funny.
If everyone hates this movie so much then don't go for the first week it's released. This boycotts Sony because the first week is when majority of the money goes to them and not the theatre. But no, Sony knows they can make this because everyone will go the first week, wanting to see how ""stupid"" the movie is. Stop complaining about a bad movie if you aren't going to do anything about it."

r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie looks like obnoxious garbage and I'm just going to ignore it from this point onward. Not even worth commenting on tbh.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"I think it reminds me of Wreck-It Ralph crossed with The Bee Movie I'm not quite sure though >.> That might explain why I simultaneously liked/hated this trailer.

*Edit* Lots of people are saying that it's impossible that the eggplant is never used but in the trailer, it seemed like their specific world was just based on that one kid's phone. So maybe it isn't so much that it's never used but just that it's not used in the world of that kid's phone? v.v I am thinking way too deeply about a crappy emoji movie."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Idk why people hating on the movie, it doesn't look that bad, a little cringe, but not bad."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is a war crime
r8pJt4dK_s4,Eggplant in the unpopular emoji room thing was the only funny part because its not true XD

r8pJt4dK_s4,The Eggplant emoji gets used a lot.
r8pJt4dK_s4,i thought it was supost to be on August 4
r8pJt4dK_s4,When you are a big company and you decide to do a movie for millenials and also cancel a the movie of Popeye
r8pJt4dK_s4,why
r8pJt4dK_s4,I thought this was canceled. it already flopped and it's not even out yet.
r8pJt4dK_s4,there's a special place in hell for the person who wrote this trash
r8pJt4dK_s4,Each day we keep moving further away from god's light
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Looks uninspired and removed from the demographic. The fact that the eggplant is ""rarely used"" demonstrates that pretty succinctly. idk like seriously ok did they even have a test audience? because the plot is copied from lego movie and poop jokes will bore the kids out of their minds. Bombsville."
r8pJt4dK_s4,where is the CANCELED emoji?

r8pJt4dK_s4,"where's the bleach emoji, I need to drink it"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"-I'm not worried about how stupid this idea for a movie is
-I'm not worried of how bad it's going to turn out to be
-I'm not worried that it rips off Wreck-it Ralph and Inside Out
-I'm not worried about whether or not it's going to age badly
-I'm not worried about the poop and finger jokes which might cause some bad messages to parents

No. What I AM worried about is that what if Wreck it Ralph 2 gets cancelled because it has something about breaking the internet just like this film indicates by the trailer."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The hope is that this trailer is a sign of a soon impending Hollywood crash. I hope when the Marvel movies have worn thin that the movie industry gets desperate enough to put it back in the hands of the filmmakers.
Another decade like the 80s, freedom for filmmakers is what we need... just hope it happens in my lifetime."

r8pJt4dK_s4,Popeye died for your sins!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is by far the stupidest thing I ever saw.
r8pJt4dK_s4,no
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Seeing that a movie about emojis being made is definitely an act of desperation for really scraping the caked charred layer of crap at the bottom of the hollywood ""idea"" barrel. How about a follow-up idea about text acronyms while you are at it?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,this trailer is completely innacurate. why would the eggplant be with the other unused emojis?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Coming in 2020, it's Fidget Spinners: The Movie!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"HAHAHAHA its not that bad, anyways im gonna dislike it to be like the others"

r8pJt4dK_s4,Wtf....... bruh 😑😑
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I guess all these ""Dislikes"" are because it's a cast full of females...right?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Mme mme bbig ddisappointment
r8pJt4dK_s4,1:09 What is the eggplant emoji doing there? LOL
r8pJt4dK_s4,I've watch the entire trailer without looking at it's visuals but here the cringy audio.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The fact this exists is sad. What type of failure as a parent must you be for your kid's ""interests"" to be emojis? IT'S LITERALLY NOTHING. It's nothing to really like or be ""in to"". This movie is parents fault."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"WHY! why. why would you do this.
why did you think this was a good idea
::::("
r8pJt4dK_s4,Yeah guys! Let's stop making Timeless movies anymore! I'll totally be able to show this to my future son!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"i don't care, i'm excited for this movie!!! Me and my friends are going to see it. I think it's going to be cute."

r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony cut plans for a Popeye movie... for this?
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie will eventually be extremely outdated
r8pJt4dK_s4,"How dare you, of course the eggplant emoji is used a lot 0/10 for huge inaccuracy"

r8pJt4dK_s4,The most unrealistic thing about this trailer is that the eggplant emoji is in the never-used lounge
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't find that emoji which describes... this.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Please get hacked again.
r8pJt4dK_s4,So...The concept is about having more than one emotion. Amazing.

r8pJt4dK_s4,Do you ever think god stays in heaven because he's scared of what he created

r8pJt4dK_s4,pinche caca de pelicula
r8pJt4dK_s4,why
r8pJt4dK_s4,"And just a reminder, some of you dipshits made this movie happen due to your uncontrollable habit of spamming emojis during every text message.


Good job, Facebook and Snapchat. Ya idiots."
r8pJt4dK_s4,lets make this the most disliked video on youtube!

r8pJt4dK_s4,its time to bomb the earth.
r8pJt4dK_s4,God is real and he hates us.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is AIDS. This is by far, one of the worst concepts i've ever seen for a fucking movie. You make Waterworld look good."

r8pJt4dK_s4,lol the like/dislike ratio tho
r8pJt4dK_s4,Can't wait for this to come out. Keep up the good work! 😂👍
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is actually a lot like inside out, but it takes place in an alternate universe where instead of using real emotions people just use icons on their phone. Oh wait that's not an alternate universe..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"James corden, T.J Miller and Patrick stewart. They probably spent most time h money on the cast"
r8pJt4dK_s4,ew
r8pJt4dK_s4,The plot of this movie already looks bad and we've only got the trailer
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I always want movies to be good. More entertainment right? But this.....

This gives me no hope. Makes me feel like the best directors working today will fall."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Only 72 days, 6 hours and 5 minutes til the movie premiere!!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Everyday we stray further from God's light.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony? Are you guys okay? Is there something you need to tell us? Blink once if you are safe and twice if you need us to call the police.
r8pJt4dK_s4,😒🔫
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Hey Boss, I heard a lot of people don't like our next movie, should we disable commenting and hide likes/dislikes?""
""Nah, what's the worst that could happen?"""
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is fucking stupid.
r8pJt4dK_s4,God left.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is why Sony's media department is going extinct. Who the hell thought this was even remotely viable as a movie?
r8pJt4dK_s4,I love how there's 12k dislikes and only 2k likes XD
r8pJt4dK_s4,.... this looks like a plot someone would writing being facetious
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony Pictures, please go bankrupt."

People are actually spending millions of dollars to make a full length feature film about these dumbass things when there are people across the entire earth that are starving and homeless... What are we doing as a species? This is so idiotic and pointless that I had to see the trailer for myself because I seriously thought it was a joke... It is not."
r8pJt4dK_s4,There's just no fucking *way* the eggplant emoji is never used
r8pJt4dK_s4,dislike si XD

r8pJt4dK_s4,Did I just watch the whole movie? 🤔
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why does Sony sucks SO hard?!
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is these the same company who give us the landwhale version of ghostbusters?
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can feel the cells dividing
r8pJt4dK_s4,"If anyone ever thinks that their ideas are dumb, remember that there is a movie made about emojis. OUT OF ALL THINGS."
r8pJt4dK_s4,who qas send here because of val???? :3 ^^ uwu
r8pJt4dK_s4,I hope this gets 0% on rotten tomatoes
r8pJt4dK_s4,👎
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The animation is good, but the plot and the way the movie goes is unoriginal. Think about it, the ""meh"" character is like Emmett from the Lego Movie. The female character acts just like Wildstyle. Also the whole world of emoji plot is just like wreck-it-ralph or inside out. The only thing I think would be good about this film is the animation and the poop emoji. That's about it."
r8pJt4dK_s4,That little Blue haired emoji looks like Sandara Park!!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,߷ I only like this emoji *xd*

r8pJt4dK_s4,"HEEEEEEY, JACKS FILMS"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I thought this thing was cancelled?
r8pJt4dK_s4,massive flop and Suicide coming your way.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"well good, i already know the plot so i don't have to see the movie"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Who wants to join me on a massive suicide?
*Old but gold*"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is just Wreck it Ralph with Emoji's
r8pJt4dK_s4,The Goal is 1 Million Dislikes! Can we do it?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"People are gonna hate watch this and it's gonna be so successful.
Also seriously, you're putting Eggplant in the unused Emoji's section? Idiots."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Who wants to join me on a massive suicide?
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's the Infinite Warfare trailer all over again.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Every day we stray further from God's light.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is so dumb.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Execute whoever wrote/funded this.
r8pJt4dK_s4,That happened and we all let it happen
r8pJt4dK_s4,end me
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie makes me want to die. I feel sorry for all the good actors in this movie. I'm waiting for this to get a rating of 0 by everyone
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is why aliens won't talk to us.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This seems like it might almost be a fun movie when iḿ really, REALLY high..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,early
r8pJt4dK_s4,to be honest I hate the teaser but the trailer was awesome better then the fucking long haul
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Here's how i reply to this movie
💩🖕🏻💤"
r8pJt4dK_s4,They canned Genndy's Popeye movie... for this... think about it.
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂👌
r8pJt4dK_s4,Wow this sucks.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Do over 11,000 honestly don't like this trailer?? I think it was pretty hilarious, energetic, and innovative. Sure the teaser was bad but I'll say this one increase my expectations for the film. Don't just jump in the badwagon and dislike it because everyone else hates it."
r8pJt4dK_s4,this make me lost my fate in humanity
r8pJt4dK_s4,"just look at the fucking like to dislike ratio, there is literally no fucking way that Sony can't see that"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony axed Popeye directed by Genndy Tartakovsky and made this instead
r8pJt4dK_s4,ew
r8pJt4dK_s4,Not even Patrick Stewart can save this.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Remember that Sony canceled the Popeye movie for this! 😖
r8pJt4dK_s4,WHY DID THEY CANCEL POPEYE FOR THIS
r8pJt4dK_s4,Will everyone stop ripping on this film as if it was the worst ever made. U haven't even seen it Jesus. What I see is a typical harmless kids film with nothing offensive in it.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is how I imagine the last years of the Roman Empire were like
r8pJt4dK_s4,this looks fun
r8pJt4dK_s4,What have we done.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Wow! the the first not so exaggerated animation from Sony since Surf's Up had to be used on poorly written film.
r8pJt4dK_s4,God damnit T.J I love you but why
r8pJt4dK_s4,"You think god stays in heaven because he too, is scared of what he created?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,🤢👎
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is probably gonna make so much money 😩
r8pJt4dK_s4,That's it everyone spam the dislike button! 👎
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm ashamed that I laughed at the poo emoji
r8pJt4dK_s4,i finally have a reason to kill myself
r8pJt4dK_s4,"God looked upon the Earth, and he wept"
r8pJt4dK_s4,so it's a love child of Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out
r8pJt4dK_s4,what the
r8pJt4dK_s4,"First Jack and Jill, now this. Please stop using ELO in these trailers for shitty movies, they don't deserve it."
r8pJt4dK_s4,😒 meh... pass
r8pJt4dK_s4,THE CANCER IS TOO MUCH
r8pJt4dK_s4,Popeye was cancelled for this?
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is the end of western culture.
r8pJt4dK_s4,wtf
r8pJt4dK_s4,lel how long until ratings are disabled
r8pJt4dK_s4,I would love to make a video game of this idea!
r8pJt4dK_s4,The characters are so one dimensional and the plot is so cliche that I'm pretty sure I already know the entire story. Candy crush is still relevant too... right?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"the end of the world of emojis and youtube,Movies,Trash cans,And A fat man eating mcdonalda and coke"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I just threw up in my mouth
r8pJt4dK_s4,"So Sony super-glued 'Inside Out' and 'Wreck It Ralph' together into this fucking Dr Moreau abomination the likes of which no human being ever asked for?
Yeah, great business plan there. This is the fucking EPITOME of doing what's popular just because it's popular without thinking about how it'll actually turn out
How much money did you WASTE on this?!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"the apocalypse it's coming guys!
THE END OF THE WORLD IS COMING!!! 😐➡⌛😵🔫🌍🎆"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why does such nice animation have to be wasted on a movie about freakin' emojis?...
r8pJt4dK_s4,The movie that will save the cinema.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Thank you Jacksfilms for finding me a reason to live
r8pJt4dK_s4,how is the eggplant emoji never used
r8pJt4dK_s4,me dan asco
r8pJt4dK_s4,CinemaSins doesn't need to watch this movie to count the sins. He can just watch the trailer and count everything from there.
r8pJt4dK_s4,at least sony showed the whole movie in this trailer so i don't have to pay in theaters
r8pJt4dK_s4,No one asked for this and whatever corporate producer who thought this up should be tried for attempted genocide

r8pJt4dK_s4,jesus died in vain

r8pJt4dK_s4,"This pretty much sums up how Sony riped off Wreck It Ralph and Lego Movie all at once, are you joking?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"The moral sounds forced, the animation's good, not a fan that the guy from Silicon Valley is the main character since the voice doesn't fit. Jokes are meh. This looks like something Illumination would do. I hate Illumination, almost as much as Sony"

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony aren't even setting the comments to top comments because everyone hates this movie, Sony needs to stop, all the Smurfs movies, This piece of crap, pixels, they need to stop making shitty movies"
r8pJt4dK_s4,How to make people cringe the movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,WOW this movie should get an Oscar!!! (For worst movie ever made in existence)
r8pJt4dK_s4,I could not finish this trailer.

r8pJt4dK_s4,Maybe if I bang my head hard enough on the table I'll die.
r8pJt4dK_s4,the tron reboot is looking nice
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't believe this film even exists...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"see the good thing about this movie is that nobody likes it,its good to have something everybody agrees on"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"since there's an emoji movie, why not make a meme movie?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm infected with 9 types of cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,Who did candy crush had to suck off to get this product placement
r8pJt4dK_s4,Everyday we stray further away from god
r8pJt4dK_s4,>:( bad
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Congratulations Ghostbusters 2016, you have been officially out hated."
r8pJt4dK_s4,So basically... toy story and the lego movie had a child but in a BAD WAY.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Can we have Medusa instead? I was exited for that film when I heard Faust was in charge of it.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"It's wreck it Ralph but with emojis, cause that was something that needed to happen"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony can't take a hint....
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Hell is empty and all the devils are here"" -W. Shakespeare"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Every day we stray further from God's light
r8pJt4dK_s4,Also I think emojis mostly just get used ironically. I don't think there's any heartfelt story about identity in them.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Such a huge disappointment to the history of animation
r8pJt4dK_s4,i dont want to live on this planet anymore
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks pretty good actually.
r8pJt4dK_s4,one like and I will kill myself
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is why we don't get a Popeye movie? Come on man.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I mean the movie looks like it has great animation, great voice actors, but... The fact that this is just emojis is absurd... I'd hate for this movie to not do well..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,why is this movie is so similar to Wreck It Ralph?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Reminder that we lost the Popeye movie for this piece of GARBAGE
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is there any doubt at all now that Sony just makes these movies to cook their books?
r8pJt4dK_s4,What the heck is wrong with you people?! Why do you guys hate this film already?! You people didn't see that film!
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is that erlich Bachman 🤔
r8pJt4dK_s4,Can this comment get more likes than this mistake of a film?
r8pJt4dK_s4,I don't think I've drank enough alcohol. *Grabs bottle*
r8pJt4dK_s4,cringe
r8pJt4dK_s4,I mean the hate was pretty obvious as soon as this was announced. They could have saved themselves the work of actually producing the thing.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I want this movie to come out to see how bad it does in the box office.
r8pJt4dK_s4,why
r8pJt4dK_s4,Oh no my sister name Addy

r8pJt4dK_s4,Does this movie come with a free gun? I want the option of ending it all if it gets too real
r8pJt4dK_s4,✋
r8pJt4dK_s4,Hollywood is running out of ideas
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is the worst idea for a movie ever. I feel high.
r8pJt4dK_s4,yoooooo why is the eggplant in the loser lounge tho?!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""I think we need another round of plagues""

r8pJt4dK_s4,Stop
r8pJt4dK_s4,what the hell
r8pJt4dK_s4,"You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, that you didn't stop to think if you _should_."

Characters remind me so much of the lego movie"
r8pJt4dK_s4,1:10 you're trying to tell me the EGGPLANT emoji is never used?  The eggplant emoji basically symbolizes the only reason people text nowadays.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony: What if we made a lego movie clone but took out the charm and humor and added unbearable amounts of cancer?
Producer: We should focus on Popeye, that is an awful idea
Sony: Whoops! Too late"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is not how you cater to the Millennials because everyone knows who you're trying to impress. Don't do that.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Garbage.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh man I just cured my cancer , I'm happy I can finally enjoy life again and live without the fear of dying

r8pJt4dK_s4,frame by frame break down let's go
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Hollywood, just stop it!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This entire movie is entirely kid-pandering garbage. Whoever thought up this movie is likely some weed-smoking greedy fool looking to make a quick buck off a STUPID trend. What's next, the Fidget Spinner Movie? The Bottle Flipping Movie? What about the Annoying Trends Movie? There's an idea for your greedy asses."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"this is the worst thing my eyes or body have ever been exposed to, and I've been raped, had cancer, aids and ebola and I've seen my parents doing it and a rotting corpse and the flash from an atomic bomb"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"1995: By 2015 we'll have flying cars, and have cured cancer!

2017: *The Emoji Movie*"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I feel bad for the animators who had to make this. Everything looks so nice and so much hard work was put into everything but Sony wasted the potential of these people for the biggest cash grab of 2017
r8pJt4dK_s4,HYPE!!!!!!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,god is dead and we killed him
r8pJt4dK_s4,Now this just seems like a rip off of The LEGO Movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm going to kill myself
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me me big reference 
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks like a parody movie but it's not. it's like a parody of itself.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Delete Sony Pictures, just fucking burn it down."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is just a worse lego movie. Why would anyone in their right mind watch this
r8pJt4dK_s4,only white Thots are excited for this movie

r8pJt4dK_s4,🅱
r8pJt4dK_s4,THIS IS A FUCKING RIP OFF OF THE LEGO MOVIE EVEN DOWN TO THE WEIRD EMO GIRL. The lego movie had heart at least this is literally the epitome of capitalism
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Why, Sir Patrick? Why?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"You know, if this wasn't about emojis, the plot would be pretty solid."
r8pJt4dK_s4,The producers of this should stop breathing and give their oxygen to someone more important.
r8pJt4dK_s4,THIS IS COMING OUT TWO DAYS AFTER MY BIRTHDAY I WANT TO DIE
r8pJt4dK_s4,Suicide is the only way out. Goodbye fellow kids.

r8pJt4dK_s4,I wonder how stupid they sound while reading the script for this movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I hate, and I mean HATE, saying this, but the movie looks surprisingly good!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,2015 SONY NEEDS TO DIE
r8pJt4dK_s4,What if it'll actually be decent like the Angry Birds movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,What about Popeye
r8pJt4dK_s4,"What the hell were you thinking, Sony?!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"the saddest part about this is that this movie will most likely make a fuckton of money from the kids, so they will make more like this"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Overused plot...
r8pJt4dK_s4,so inside out/wreck it ralph but shittier?

r8pJt4dK_s4,this movie goods like it could be good
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm just here for my dislike and then I go do better things with my life
r8pJt4dK_s4,1:39 that is making me very uncomfortable.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't fucking believe Jean Luc Picard himself is playing fecal matter in a meme movie that will be completely outdated in just a few years.
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is utter crap 👌
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is high five James Corden?
r8pJt4dK_s4,this movie itself is just one big meme. 🖖

r8pJt4dK_s4,"this movie looks so much better than the other movies from this year, this is a movie about adventure and love. i would not be surprised if it becomes known as one of the best animated films of all time"
r8pJt4dK_s4,the only good thing about this is the animation style. everything else is trash.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"This may sound stupid, but I am just gonna say this:


LISTEN ALL YOU GUYS: IDC if the Emoji Movie is THAT bad, I'm still gonna watch it. You can try to witch hunt me for liking this movie, but its a good movie in my opinion and that's final."
r8pJt4dK_s4,T.J.... Why?
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks radical
r8pJt4dK_s4,wreck it Ralph 2??
r8pJt4dK_s4,I still can't believe the Popeye movie was cancelled for this crap.  👎
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Are you telling me no one ever uses the eggplant emoji
Not only will this movie suck, but it's inaccurate"
r8pJt4dK_s4,woah

r8pJt4dK_s4,this movie has a poor history  :v
r8pJt4dK_s4,This story is even worse than I thought. I mean this is literally worse than food fight. This isnt a movie about product placement. This movie IS product placement. And popeye was cancelled for this garbage
r8pJt4dK_s4,If I see a film about a fidget spinner I might have to hang myself.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh my god this movie has so many dislikes. You got to be kidding me, how in the world this movie be worst than any other movie out there? It's like how the newest Ghostbusters movie was treated. How sad. Seriously originality died a long time ago (since ancient Greek, Roman and Egypt times) even before movies and television were invented. Where in the world people have been? I actually find this movie funny, entertaining and watchable."
r8pJt4dK_s4,IM READY TO DI E

r8pJt4dK_s4,"they weren't gonna make this movie.
but then so many people were happy it wasn't gonna get made that they made it.
that like deciding you weren't gonna commit suicide, and as you walked away you decided that all the cheering people needed too see you get a running start"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Utter perfection.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why is there a chole price emoji?
r8pJt4dK_s4,where is the noose emoji
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen. What the hell was your marketing strategy? Everyone young enough to understand this movie absolutely hates it.
r8pJt4dK_s4,are you all proud of yourselves?
r8pJt4dK_s4,GOD HAS FORSAKEN US
r8pJt4dK_s4,Patrick Stewart.. Why? I trusted you!

r8pJt4dK_s4,Marketing and money: The film!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Ah, I see Sony is recycling the same music they used for the trailer of Jack & Jill.
Maybe they are sending us hints of what this movie is going to be..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is disgusting. I beg someone to please put a fucking bullet in my skull.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Dude, the amount of free publicity jacksfilms is getting this movie, they better thank him"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me me big boi

r8pJt4dK_s4,They cancelled Popeye for this?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh, so the plot is the same as wreck it ralph... 

Ralph doesn't want to be a bad guy.
Meh doesn't want to have a single emotion. Ralph, Felix, and that one lady with the gun go game-jumping. Meh, Jailbreak, and high-five try to escape the phone. In both movies, the protagonists' antics end up effecting things in the real world.


I assume that the ending will be the same. Meh will be accepted for who he is, as Ralph is."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"My God, this is such an idiotic idea for a movie I've ever seen."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"1:45

Life of Pi 2 looks great."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I hate myself
r8pJt4dK_s4,😊
r8pJt4dK_s4,"To be honest, ignoring the fact that everyone is hating on the movie because of the ""cringe"" honestly makes it more interesting (to me).
The animation and humor are my top priorities for a good animated entertaining movie . The animation is smooth and soothing, and the humor really stands out to me
I have to admit, the idea is weird (little stupid), but hey, it's quality and humorous (according to the trailers).

r8pJt4dK_s4,me me big dissapointment
r8pJt4dK_s4,"so the plot is about someone who is bound to be something that they dont want to, they want to be something else... where have i seen this before"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't believe this is real.
r8pJt4dK_s4,God is dead and we killed him.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Remember Popeye got cancelled for this
r8pJt4dK_s4,every video gets worse
r8pJt4dK_s4,"do I care about this movie?

r8pJt4dK_s4,why
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is getting a lot more hate then it deserves.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"please, god please, fucking end yourself, I'm begging you, or atleast end me."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is piece of crap and Sony sucks!!!!!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"It still looks garbage, but not as bad as the first trailer."
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm cutting myself....
r8pJt4dK_s4,Every day we stray further from God's light.
r8pJt4dK_s4,A fucking love story with emojis.

r8pJt4dK_s4,"This was actually bearable until the last ""joke"""
r8pJt4dK_s4,I want death
r8pJt4dK_s4,Everyday we strive further from god
r8pJt4dK_s4,"So let me get this straight: They cancelled Popeye, an American cartoon icon, for a movie about something that's not even going to be popular in another 10-15 years?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Do you ever think that god rethinks of what he's created
r8pJt4dK_s4,bad
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is not the bad movie this is disaster movie for all of time.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I'm sorry for saying this, but I can't wait to see this movie. The animation is actually good, but the writing and the story could have use a little bit of work."
r8pJt4dK_s4,God has officially left us
r8pJt4dK_s4,oh i'll enjoy the reviews.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony's the worst
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me me BIG disappointment
r8pJt4dK_s4,if there was some way that this movie ended up being really good i'd still just hate it for the fact that it exists
r8pJt4dK_s4,"this movie feels like Inside Out, Wreck it Ralph and The Lego Movie mixed into a blender and had sprinkles of Hotel Transylvania 2 i mean think about it guys you have this character that doesn't fit in with the crowed and you also have these characters that have one permanent expression it's just like in those 3 movies i mentioned and the climax is that the other characters try to go make the main character become normal and that's just like hotel transylvania 2 so this movie lacks so much originality"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Well now I know how dark the world is
😣🔫"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Hope this bombs hard at the box office so we can get Spider-man back to Marvel.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This movie is worse than i thought it was going to be. seriously sony thought this was a good idea? Tommy Wiseau could make a better animated movie than this, it wouldn't be good but at least a Wiseau movie is entertaining"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I just cried...
This video is so powerful"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Ok, there were some cringey parts, but it doesn't seem THAT bad. I guess we'll see when the movie comes out"
r8pJt4dK_s4,THIS IS AWESOME
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh brother... this seems like one heeeeeeeeell of a stretch. 😒

Although, Patrick Stewart rarely is involved with a terrible project, so I am now officially conflicted. 😱"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"does everyone hate this movie because there emojis, or is it much more than that"
r8pJt4dK_s4,😔🔫
r8pJt4dK_s4,Money grubbing jews
r8pJt4dK_s4,I don't get why people think this is so cringey
r8pJt4dK_s4,Day One I'm There.

r8pJt4dK_s4,STOP NO ONE WANTS EMOJIS TO HAVE A ROMANTIC SUBPLOT
r8pJt4dK_s4,I want to fucking die
r8pJt4dK_s4,I hate to jump on the hate bandwagon but this feels a lot like Wreck-It Ralph.... idk i probably wouldn't  go see it until it comes out on DVD or something
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is Wreck it Ralph
r8pJt4dK_s4,Reaction: Meh...😂

r8pJt4dK_s4,Why are all the top comments posted minutes ago? Is Sony deleting comments?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Didn't think it'd be this soon until we got something worse than the minions, but here we are. Still gonna make a shitload of money, so just go ahead and shoot me in the face."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"How's actually gonna see this movie

r8pJt4dK_s4,"it changed the release date...

r8pJt4dK_s4,GO DRINK BLEACH
r8pJt4dK_s4,Best movie 1942.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Popeye was canceled for this
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Bye Felicia"" - even this joke is not helping this film!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,i get why people hate on the movie so much and so did i but i actually think it will be fun. yea its pretty much another wreck it ralph but still who said copies should be bad? i guess its hate comes from the fact it is centered around a culture that is only spread to kids. but so were games back in the day. it doesnt tingle your nostalgia like ralph cos its still a new culture unlike arcades and 16 bit games and instead focuses on the smartphones. i guess the movie is just a bit before its time. like 10 years or so.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Nice joke
r8pJt4dK_s4,I thought this movie was cancelld . Some one please reply
r8pJt4dK_s4,🍆🍆🍆 why is the eggplant in the place where all the never-used emojis go 🍆🍆🍆
r8pJt4dK_s4,💩 indeed.
r8pJt4dK_s4,We could've had Wreck It Ralph 2! BUT NOOOOOO! WE HAVE TO GET THIS BULLSHIT!

r8pJt4dK_s4,Wow just wow they're really releasing this piece of 💩 on the FUCKING BIG SCREEN!!!

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Seeing the new trailer for this, it doesn't look as bad."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"It looks stupid, but it also looks like it could be fun. I think most people against it are just compying other people's opinions."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"How fake. 
The eggplant emoji is considered never used? It's the most used emoji on my phone"
r8pJt4dK_s4,eggplant is not used?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Fitting that the trailer ended with Poop Emojis.
r8pJt4dK_s4,me me biiiiiiig boiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

r8pJt4dK_s4,A mix between Wreck it Ralph and Inside Out
r8pJt4dK_s4,This Is Wreck It Ralph; Ruined by unneeded cliches. WHY?!

r8pJt4dK_s4,thought this was cancelled...goddammit
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh they dragged poor ELO into this, that actually hurts me on the inside."
r8pJt4dK_s4,The cast probably hated the idea from the very beginning
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why is everyone hating on this movie? Isn't not like they are forcing you to watch it!

r8pJt4dK_s4,I want to die
r8pJt4dK_s4,"All phone apps are short trends that end in a few months, even giant marketing concepts like Pokemon go lose public interest very quickly. Phones SUCK for personality - they're a utility and a distraction, nothing more. An emoji movie is bland and depressingly out of touch."
r8pJt4dK_s4,NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS! BRING POPEYE BACK!!!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,straight up trash
r8pJt4dK_s4,NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I feel like people are just hating this movie just for the sake of hating. The 1st trailer was pretty awful ,sure, and the idea behind it is unnecessary, but this trailer makes it at least somewhat entertaining. Who knows, it could be a huge hit."

That's about two more chuckles than I thought I'd get out of this."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Who thought this was going to be the best and perfect idea!?
r8pJt4dK_s4,thanks jacksfilms
r8pJt4dK_s4,Pretending the eggplant is never used. Ha. No chance
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't believe it... I can't believe this is a real thing.. This is like when rick from rick and morty plugs his alternate reality tv and there is a reality where this bullshit exist

r8pJt4dK_s4,The only reason people hate this is because they hate emojis and it sucks

r8pJt4dK_s4,This didn't need to be a movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,This wasn't a joke. God why?
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is a perfect example of Hollywood running out of ideas and only caring about money
r8pJt4dK_s4,This #movie 🎬 is going to be #lit 🔥🔥💯💯👅👅😃😂😁😀😍
r8pJt4dK_s4,WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS
r8pJt4dK_s4,Slit my wrist.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"IHE's The Search For The Worst, anyone?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Eggplant is never used according to this
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Did he just say ""Bye Felicia?"""
r8pJt4dK_s4,what if emojis had feelings?
r8pJt4dK_s4,*sees eggplant emoji as never used* They have obviously never been on the internet
r8pJt4dK_s4,Did they just insert the we are number 1 meme in there XD
r8pJt4dK_s4,#SquadFam
r8pJt4dK_s4,Even the fucking emoji movie is using the inception bass drop.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This is literally Wreck it Ralph. The main character is upset with who he is so he decides to escape his home. On his perilous journey he meets a young female who'll eventually be his life long best friend. But before he can even get to where he's going he's gotta travel through multiple different games. Oh yeah and the people on the outside have absolutely no idea about the world inside, as a matter of fact because of the things they do inside, it fucks things for the people outside. 
Creativity at its best."
r8pJt4dK_s4,when you run out of ideas
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony I can't believe you've done this
r8pJt4dK_s4,Jacksfilms anybody?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I swear to god, if theres an aubergine joke in this movie..."

r8pJt4dK_s4,I actually wanna see this
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Its crazy to see how people can't forge themselves an opinion and follow like little sheeps ! beh beh
This isn't that bad, yes the idea is kind of lame, but who knows if the story is that bad.
And for all I know, the animation is really good !
I'm also a very big fan of john, but the meme is funny, the hate it caused isn't"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Double toasted brought me here
r8pJt4dK_s4,Ffs haven't they realised that this movie doesn't and shouldn't exist? It literally became a meme before it was even released
r8pJt4dK_s4,meme big boy
r8pJt4dK_s4,why is the eggplant emoji in the place where emojis don't get used?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"“The Emoji Movie” is told entirely within a closed world. That’s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Eric Siegel and Mike White is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Emoji family entirely on its own terms. Gene (T. J. Miller) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional meh emoji does nothing of which we can really disapprove."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"You know, just because people are commenting that they don't like this film doesn't mean they just hate it to hate it without watching it. some do, some don't. Me? Eh. Watched it. Didn't like it. Doesn't mean you have to hate it, make your own opinion. if you like it, fine. I don't agree, but whatever."

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony, do you see how so many comments use… I don't know, letters? You know, actual words? Do you really think emojis are STILL that popular? They're only popular with marketing people desperate for SOME kind of sale and SOME kind of relevance. This movie will look SO good ten years from now"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Oh, God, they used an ELO song for the trailer...now they've gone too far"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I hope they will have a segment in their movie called

YOU CANCELLED A MOVIE BY THE CREATOR OF SAMURAI JACK AND DEXTER'S LABORATORY.
FOR THIS.
And you roped in Patrick Stewart somehow as the poo. And James Corden. and you did the basic ""Hero finds his true purpose and defeats social norms"" plot that's been done 50 times. And you got TJ Miller somehow.
Congratssss."

plz kill me"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is so inaccurate... EGGPLANT IN THE LOSER'S LOUNGE?!?! Seriously? 😂😏
r8pJt4dK_s4,💩🔫😂😂😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂🔫
r8pJt4dK_s4,All I hear is Erlich
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me Me Big Boy?
r8pJt4dK_s4,way to telegraph the main villain in your goddamn trailer sony.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Smiley face! Smiley face! Hula girl! or Eggplant! is not going to make the Top 10 Box Office""
Hal Rudnick (Screen Junkies)"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't wait to see the memes that come out of this film
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me me BIG boy.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Wreck it Ralph and inside out rip off
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why so much hate?
r8pJt4dK_s4,I thought they cancelled this
r8pJt4dK_s4,💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Bullshit this movie will have:
• Cheesy moments, talking about how perfect people is the way they are.
• A fucking pop song.
• Pointless dance sequences.
• A motherfuckin romantic interest (I bet it's the emoji that looks like an emo with dyed hair, what leads to the nexto point)
• Lots and lots of fucking puns like: ""Hi, I'm an EMOji"".
• A cheesy ending about everyone accepting the main character the way he is.
• Parents admitting that they were wrong and saying that their son is perfect the way he is.
• Probably (or not) a ridiculous background story about that hi-five emoji.
• ""Funny"" moments exploring apps in the cellphone.
• The main character struggling with himself about whether or not he should be like everyone else.
• Somehow there was a menace for everyone but SOMEHOW the protagonist will save the fucking day, what will lead everyone to accept him the fucking way he is!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's pretty much Wreck it Ralph but with emojis
r8pJt4dK_s4,It's pretty much Wreck it Ralph but with emojis
r8pJt4dK_s4,My day has been ruined
r8pJt4dK_s4,God is dead and we killed him
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Wait...Gene is voiced by T.J Miller?
ROBBIE FROM GRAVITY FALLS SHARES THE SAME VOICE AS A EMOJI?!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me Me Big Emoji
r8pJt4dK_s4,End me.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Why Fred, why are you in this?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Well that just happened
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Let's just say, for the sake of the argument, that this movie will not be trash(which it will be anyway). How would you react?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"this is just a rip off of Wreck it Ralph, they even go to a Candy Land."
r8pJt4dK_s4,😒
r8pJt4dK_s4,A failure
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This gives me a sinking feeling inside, like my heart is bleeding, like when an emergency comes up and you know your life is about to take a nosedive.
This trailer has the feeling of death upon it."
r8pJt4dK_s4,many ppl hatin must be old ppl :( u need to b millenial to get it. Stop hatin smthg you dont get.
r8pJt4dK_s4,The delayed the dark tower movie for this
r8pJt4dK_s4,the eggplant does get used
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony: THE EMOJI MOVIE!
Academy: Gimme all those fucking Oscars!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,as soon as they revealed the plot was about him having more than one emotion and going on a journey to be like everyone else it was super predictable he'd learn being different was a good thing now the trailer straight up tells us
r8pJt4dK_s4,THE CRAP MOVIE
r8pJt4dK_s4,Who the hell thought this would be a good idea? I want names.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I wouldn't even ironically watch this and it will probably make sony pictures go out of business.
r8pJt4dK_s4,We killed god
r8pJt4dK_s4,I was dry before this I swear
r8pJt4dK_s4,IT ACTUALLY LOOKS PRETTY GOOD!
r8pJt4dK_s4,...Why...?
r8pJt4dK_s4,please cancel this
r8pJt4dK_s4,These directors are true mad lads if they don't cancel
r8pJt4dK_s4,Sony proves to be trash once again
r8pJt4dK_s4,Good thing they spoiled the plot inside this trailer so I dont have to see this trash
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why ELO? Why did you allow your awesome music to be in awful trailer?
r8pJt4dK_s4,this looks horrible wtf who signed off on this
r8pJt4dK_s4,I hope Disney sue them for literally steal the plot of wrecking Ralph
r8pJt4dK_s4,Angerey Facebook react emoji plz
r8pJt4dK_s4,THIS IS LIKE THE BEE MOVIE AND WRECK IT RALPH COMBINED SO WILL THE HATERS SHUT UP AND APPRECIATE THE WORKMANSHIP GOSH YOU PEOPLE ARE GETTING WORSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't believe this is real.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I came here to dislike the video
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Nooooo, not TJ Miller. I loved him in Deadpool and Big Hero 6. I'm hoping that this doesn't ruin his career. Well, hopefully Ready Player One should be good in 2018. It's got Simon Pegg in it and it's directed by Steven Spielberg. And hey, at least we have Deadpool 2 as well. I think he'll be fine."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Discover the secret inside your gun; this movie makes me want to fucking shoot myself.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Omg can't wait omg
r8pJt4dK_s4,"For some reason I recognise the main characters voice
I mean I don't like this movie 
I just wanna know"
r8pJt4dK_s4,God has left earth
r8pJt4dK_s4,💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,🍆
r8pJt4dK_s4,So it's basically Wreck It Ralph? Same plot just in a phone.
r8pJt4dK_s4,eggplant emoji never used? That's a lie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Alternative names: suicide movie 
No idea movie
Why did they do this movie"
r8pJt4dK_s4,so this is basically Inside Out in a phone😕😕😕
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is bad the animation looks great but WHY
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why so many dislikes??? The trailer isn`t that bad
r8pJt4dK_s4,God has left us
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Well they put more effort into this trailer than the last one, that's for sure."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"wow, what a plot
star wars story was fucking destroyed with this movie"
r8pJt4dK_s4,When I saw the movie poster I thought it was a joke. But they were dead serious about releasing this movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm just here putting my dislike BECAUSE THIS IS THE WORST IDEA EVER!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,god is good
r8pJt4dK_s4,If this doesn't win Oscar for best movie this year then somethings seriously wrong
r8pJt4dK_s4,Oh boy they did not have to make this movie based on emojis 😩
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie looks amazing.
r8pJt4dK_s4,End my life.
r8pJt4dK_s4,this looks so bad 👎👎👎👎
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why is Chloe from Life is strange in this?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This looks so awful.




Who else is seeing it day one?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,So basically A cheap wreck it ralph....
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,I need to kill myself.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"It's the fucking Lego Movie...the chick looks like wyldstyle, he's supposed be all unassuming and meh, his partner is an idiot like Batman, there's even a main villain with robot minions that have claws just like the micromanagers! It's just fucking Lego Movie!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Too many dislikes. There's more positive buzz now. Just people hating something to follow the bandwagon.
r8pJt4dK_s4,No
r8pJt4dK_s4,The new Tron movie looks amazing
r8pJt4dK_s4,So Wreck it Ralph but with Emoji's?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I mean, it kinda looks like a cute movie, its harmless"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Everyone here is an assfart, movies don't have to be perfect all the time and this is not great but at least it's pleasing to me. Poop is gonna be my favorite and I'd imagine him as a rich guy in my story."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"0:11 Wow, today's kids are really fucking dumb. They can't do anything even communicate without their phones."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is literally the worst thing I've ever seen. I am actively rooting for this movie to fail miserably.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why are people hating this? This looks like a good movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,LOl the girl from Life is strange :V

r8pJt4dK_s4,"I'm not disappointed, just mad..."
r8pJt4dK_s4,You. Cancelled. The. Popeye movie. FOR THISSSSS???!!!!!! How do you sleep at night you heartless bastards!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,there is no god
r8pJt4dK_s4,💩 sums up the whole movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Seems like a good movie cause I love animation and the only thing that matters to me are Rotten Tomatoes
r8pJt4dK_s4,🖕
r8pJt4dK_s4,This was gonna be called _Everything Wrong with Sony Animation in One Big Messy Attempt to Connect to Today's Youth: The Movie_ but it didn't roll off the tongue that well.
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm never using emojis again.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""Cough"" Inside Out ripoff ""cough"""
r8pJt4dK_s4,jesus christ
r8pJt4dK_s4,This sure beats Sausage Party.
r8pJt4dK_s4,¿alguien vio al pacman? ¿donde esta el :V?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Heck this film is a complete rehash of Wreck It Ralph but with Emoji's and a touch of inside out
r8pJt4dK_s4,God left.
r8pJt4dK_s4,1:58 This reminds me of a scene from Wreck-it Ralph.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Just look at the dislikes already.
r8pJt4dK_s4,2016 wasn't the worst year...
r8pJt4dK_s4,I don't care if this turns out good or not. I will Never Forgive Sony for turning down Genndy's Popeye movie or Lauren Faust's Medusa.I want this flim to fail miserably.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"remember kids, it's down the street, not across the road"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"UP NEXT:
Letters the movie."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Well Sony is definitely desperate if this is what they are relying on to save them from bankruptcy
r8pJt4dK_s4,The animation is way better than it has any right to be
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is why God abandoned us.
r8pJt4dK_s4,The movie doesn't look bad but the plot seems prodictable.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Wreck it ralph, but worse"
r8pJt4dK_s4,God has blessed us today
r8pJt4dK_s4,SO GODDAMN FUCKING COOL!!!! I LOVE EMOJIS1
r8pJt4dK_s4,Eggplant-emoji in the not veryoften used launge - *extremly donald trump voice* WRONG
r8pJt4dK_s4,Why does this have to exist?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"huh… this actually looks pretty interesting, if you ask me. Maybe it won't be as bad as we thought"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"*Inside Out* + *Lego Movie* + *Wreck It Ralph* + *Sony's greediness* + *""Hip""/Trend* + 💩💩💩💩💩 = *THIS MOVIE!*


But I may have a small, teeny weenie doubt this film might be good tho"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Why is the eggplant in the Loser Lounge? Everyone uses the eggplant, for he is the phallic symbol of today's youth! If they're not even gonna pay attention to the intricate lore behind emojis, then they will NOT be getting my viewership."
r8pJt4dK_s4,This actually looks good
r8pJt4dK_s4,My rating for this trailer is: 💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,👌😂🔫
r8pJt4dK_s4,I don't even care if this Popeye movie was cancelled I think I'm going to give this Emoji Movie a chance I don't care if this trailer gets a lot of dislikes and Hate I'm going to give this a chance
r8pJt4dK_s4,So it's inside out but with emojis and phones..
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I dont think this will be any good, but this movie gets to much hate."
r8pJt4dK_s4,OH BROTHER THIS MOVIE STINKS!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,forgive me lord for i have sinned
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Bring Popeye back... Please..
What's next, Ads the movie?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,The eggplant emoji is never used? excuse me?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Hype
r8pJt4dK_s4,🖕
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't believe this will probably be at the Oscars next year...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Jesus fucking christ, this is literally the original sin. Seriously, this is the ugliest looking animated movie I've seen this year"
r8pJt4dK_s4,FUCKING KILL ME
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Eggplant emoji unused?

ok Sony"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I've given up on humanity, and this is why."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"say what you want, the concept of having to keep the same emotion for their whole life is depressing man"
r8pJt4dK_s4,but why.gif
r8pJt4dK_s4,"😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧
Sums up how I feel about it"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Are we just going to pretend this isn't JUST like Lego movie but with cancer?
r8pJt4dK_s4,I wonder what AniMat thinks about this.
r8pJt4dK_s4,God has left us.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"""bye Felecia"" 
Please fucking shoot me"
r8pJt4dK_s4,its just a wreck-it-ralph movie remake. thats all
r8pJt4dK_s4,💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,1:34 😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie will be the catalyst of a new animation renaissance
r8pJt4dK_s4,"1:09  ohhhh,you don't know ;)"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is a perfect official trailer ! No cancel this movie anymore ! : )
r8pJt4dK_s4,looks like fucking cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,This reminds me of Inside Out which was a good movie but TJ Miller is kinda throwing me off lol.
r8pJt4dK_s4,The Emoji Movie is better than The Angry Birds Movie !
r8pJt4dK_s4,why is erlich from silicon valley in this? this is sad on many levels
r8pJt4dK_s4,Delete this.
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is just Wreck It Ralph with emojis
r8pJt4dK_s4,People use the eggplant emoji wtf?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me Me Big Excitment
r8pJt4dK_s4,💩
r8pJt4dK_s4,the DELETE THIS movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,this looks incredible. movie of the year
r8pJt4dK_s4,cancel amazing spiderman 3. cancel the popeyes movie. because sony doesnt know hownto treat directors. AND THEY ALLOWED THIS CRAP TO BE MADE???? and its about time TJ Miller fucked up since transformers 4
r8pJt4dK_s4,They really did that
r8pJt4dK_s4,cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,oh boi can't wait jacksfilms to see this
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Well... it looks visually interesting, I guess."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Hang on, what's the eggplant doing in the area where the unused emojis go?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Hey Sony, Could you like..... Stop?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"the concept of the movie is ridiculous and stupid. though from the trailer i have to admit, it looks quite entertaining"
r8pJt4dK_s4,the end is near
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This looks so dumb. It's so by-the-numbers about a guy that doesn't fit in and goes on a journey of self-discovery while being hounded by a person that seeks to maintain the status quo. They couldn't have made a more generic plot. And not even Patrick Stewart as the Poop Emoji helped. The jokes they showed were so lame, and it seemed like they were just ripping off Wreck-It-Ralph, as many others here have commented. Plus, NO ONE wanted a movie about EMOJIS except some corporate bigwigs at Sony that thought it would appeal to the most vapid of millennials. Go home, Sony, and stop trying to shove inane tentpoles down our throats like you attempted to last year with Ghostbusters."
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen in my entire life D:
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm so happy they finally made Inanimate Insanity into a movie.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"just gonna say it, the love interest looks like she she shouldn't be in this movie"
r8pJt4dK_s4,THE FUCKING PLAGUE IS UPON US!!! Corporate Hollywood has finally reached the very depths of depravity. There's no bottom of the barrel anymore. This is beneath the barrel. The Emoji Movie is the final nail in the coffin for Hollywood as we know it.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is going to flop so bad.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is this the new Wreck It Ralph 2 movie?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Someone send this to Jacksfilms.
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks worse than Cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,this looks interesting
r8pJt4dK_s4,This movie is going to age terribly.
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I'm sorry about Popeye but I'm gonna say this... I like this trailer!
Please respect my opinion and don't hate this movie just because Internet does"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Wreck-it-Ralph has more purpose than this... ""abomination movie"". lol"
r8pJt4dK_s4,I can't wait for the fidget spinner movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂😂😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,Of course their number two. Robbie Rotten is number one
r8pJt4dK_s4,they made a Bye Felicia joke...
r8pJt4dK_s4,this is why trump got elected
r8pJt4dK_s4,Concentrate all dislikes on the trailer's ratings!
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Yes, it's a strange idea to make a movie about emojis, but the trailer doesn't look THAT bad. It's kinda ok"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Me Me Big Boy
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Patrick Stewart, have you no SHAME?!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"lol, 2:02"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"⬆️  👀 🗑️




(This looks trash)"
r8pJt4dK_s4,WRECK IT RALPH + INSIDE OUT = Emoji Nuts ..
r8pJt4dK_s4,Looks Good.
r8pJt4dK_s4,everyday we stray further from god
r8pJt4dK_s4,that like to dislike ratio
r8pJt4dK_s4,XD the movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,end me lol
r8pJt4dK_s4,"*Spoiler*






☺😁😲😵😍😈"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Looks like a half assed dollar store knock off of Wreck It Ralph
r8pJt4dK_s4,cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,So this is just a really crap version of Inside Out?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Instead of disliking because it's somewhat *cool* to hate emojis, like for the effort they put into an *original* and *funny* movie!!!"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Goodbye Sony Pictures, may you never make movies again."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Seems like your average ""falling in love with someone after wandering in a huge world with a lot of strangers and then having an adventure"" movie with emojis sprinkled on top of it. I'll admit, I expected worse, but it's honestly still gonna flop."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"this is nonsense. Why is 🍆 in the ""not used emojis lounge"" ?! That's THE EMOJI people use while sexting.
FAKE.
DISLIKE"
r8pJt4dK_s4,uhh I don't think the eggplant emoji is underutilised
r8pJt4dK_s4,so....inside out meets wreck it ralph?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"So, Inside Out? But emojis? Original"
r8pJt4dK_s4,*_EMOJI IS MY NEW RELIGION_*
r8pJt4dK_s4,"This doesn't look as terrible as i thought it would. But still, why does it exist?
We could have had a Pop Eye movie by now."
r8pJt4dK_s4,The cringe is strong with this one...
r8pJt4dK_s4,This is what gives people cancer
r8pJt4dK_s4,Is it bad that I laughed during this trailer....
r8pJt4dK_s4,Meh
r8pJt4dK_s4,It somehow looks even worse than I expected
r8pJt4dK_s4,Finally !

r8pJt4dK_s4,They scrap off Popeye for this piece of useless junk with stupid plot and movie that people won't pay to watch? Sony made another dumb decision
r8pJt4dK_s4,God have leaved us. And this is the proof
r8pJt4dK_s4,"remember, they canceled the popeye movie for this"
r8pJt4dK_s4,The dumbing down of society continues.
r8pJt4dK_s4,No a bad idea for an animated movie of 2017 😧
r8pJt4dK_s4,"thats a lot better
but still fucking awful"
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks like a huge pile of a Patrick Stewart voiced character
r8pJt4dK_s4,"You happy now, Jacksfilms?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,Nice idea 😀
r8pJt4dK_s4,Umm Eggplant emoji is actually used all the time. You know why...
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Why is the eggplant 🍆 emoji in the ""Emojis That Are Never Used"" club?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,wow is this new artstyle for popeye the Sailor movie?
r8pJt4dK_s4,Theres needs to be an *EGGPLANT* and *PEACH* reference. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
r8pJt4dK_s4,I'm here before more dislikes than likes!
r8pJt4dK_s4,have you ever though that God stays in heaven because he lives in fear of what he has created
r8pJt4dK_s4,that's emojis life :D
r8pJt4dK_s4,We all know the eggplant is not never used
r8pJt4dK_s4,This looks awful why Sony why
r8pJt4dK_s4,Yes you guys are mad about Popeye which I am too. Hopefully they finish making it.... but at least try to give this a chance
r8pJt4dK_s4,How about no
r8pJt4dK_s4,0:30 *A hot dog talking to popcorn.* I love the universe.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Petition for *Sausage Party* easter eggs.

r8pJt4dK_s4,*SAUSAGE PARTY KIDS VERSION*
r8pJt4dK_s4,Kill it with Fire!!!
r8pJt4dK_s4,Still waiting for the Japanese demon emojis...
r8pJt4dK_s4,Actually pure cancer in form of a movie
r8pJt4dK_s4,Imagine Inside Out with a bunch of various faces in a phone. XD
r8pJt4dK_s4,popeye looks good
r8pJt4dK_s4,Wow! It's even worse than I ever imagined!

r8pJt4dK_s4,( 一一)(ー_ー;)
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Sony Picture is going downhill. Their movie qualities are dropping every year, the executive must step up and revitalize their company or else they will go bankrupt. The only division Sony is getting profit is from their Playstation division."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Everybody should experience this film like everyone should experience a massive bomb exploding in someone's face.
r8pJt4dK_s4,Stop production of this film please
r8pJt4dK_s4,Will they show Snapchat nudes in the movie?
r8pJt4dK_s4,"I'm loving how bad this is im defiantly seeing this movie 
👍🏾💩👍🏾"
r8pJt4dK_s4,😂
r8pJt4dK_s4,"It's probably a social faux pas to respond to this trailer without using emojis, isn't it?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"WTFFFFF!!Ok, the first trailer looks worst than this.But,even so,this is very veryyyyyyyy stupid and dumb for me.Anybody wants this,Sony.Anybody.THIS IS A PLOT VERY SILLY FOR A MOVIE."
r8pJt4dK_s4,"maybe you mean ""The Cancer Movie"" ?"
r8pJt4dK_s4,"Say what you want, it looks like it's going to be an *excellent* and *original* movie."
r8pJt4dK_s4,Looks cool

r8pJt4dK_s4,"Am I subconsciously supposed to feel like this Yellow dude is SpongeBob, his five fingered friend is Patrick and the Brainy girl with a hat is Sandy? 😒👍🤦‍♂️"

zyYgDtY2AMY,Isn't it about time we make a movie about Senna vs Prost?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Wasn't the original name of this movie changed or something shortly after this trailer came out? What was the original name?
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Yeah Tokyo drift may be my favorite movie but...
*this one might be my new favorite*"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Godspeed Lee... hope you got to see this...
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Once upon a time in hollywood: Im the best movie of the year
Ford v Ferrari: *No i dont think you are*"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I am so in line already !! This is my kind of movie...üëç
zyYgDtY2AMY,Just realize this is the first movie where Matt Damon stars a character that will help a company beat its rival that dominated the scene. Huh.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I was a fool for watching this trailer, as if Bale would make a movie I wouldn‚Äôt watch"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Legendary.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt and bale for next F&F
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Hey, anyone didn't notice that Noah Jupe also in here??"
zyYgDtY2AMY,yeeaaah! life!
zyYgDtY2AMY,This will be worth seeing great actors I have only watched trailer 43 times and still 3months to go
zyYgDtY2AMY,RIP Carroll Shelby and Lee Iaccoca. American car designing legends.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ferrari: He's making his first mistake.
Ford: It's not a mistake. They don't make mistakes. They don't do random. There's always an objective. Always a target.
Ferrari: The objectives and targets always came from us. Who's giving them to him now?
Ford: Scary version? He is."
zyYgDtY2AMY,3k Chevy guys disliked this video.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"FORZA FERRARI !!

Que Bella Machina!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Yeah baby!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"By the time Shelby and Holman Moody got through with it there was not much British left in it.   The motor was Ford,  the trans axle was Ford,  the wheels were Halibrand, the tires were Goodyear,  the suspension had been completely redesigned and the body had been redesigned in an American wind tunnel.    It started off British......... but by the time  Dan Gurney and A J  Foyt won Le Mans in '67 it was about as British as cowboy boots."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"""My name is Carroll Shelby and performance is my business."" - Carroll Shelby (1923 - 2012) RIP."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian Bale is a chameleon.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Slowly
zyYgDtY2AMY,Nice for sunday morning
zyYgDtY2AMY,Some of you guys go to the track ?
zyYgDtY2AMY,AHHHHHHHHHHH! I got to wait until November for this movie ??? Crap !!!!! Can't wait.

zyYgDtY2AMY,Just the movie trailer is more exciting than the current F1 season.....
zyYgDtY2AMY,Fuxk Chevy
zyYgDtY2AMY,The ford gt40
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Forza Motorsport 6 launch trailer brought me back in time.
And Carroll Shelby's last car to build was a 2011 or 2013 Ford Shelby GT500."
zyYgDtY2AMY,This picture must be a real dud. It should have been released months ago. Problem movies get shelved. This looks like it has all the ingredients for a bomb.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Fun fact: apart from Tesla Ford is the only car company in the world that has never gone bankrupt.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I am looking forward to seeing this movie, thank god Hollywood didnt decide to make Henry Ford 2 and Carol Shelby women, just for the sake of diversity and social inclusion."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Love how the rolling stones are relevant in movies
zyYgDtY2AMY,i am speed

zyYgDtY2AMY,"OK. OK. OK. This is good trailer. Yes, it is. I forgot to mention... I like main actors quite a bit :). Small detail."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Man to all my car guys out there, this movie means a lot"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Carroll Fooking Shelby...
zyYgDtY2AMY,A real car guy movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,Please give Peter Brock his due .  1965 put Shelby on the map again.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford: go to war...
Shelby: thank you sir...

The most American thing I've heard..."
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is my kind of movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ford n.2 in f.1 wins 1967-2019
zyYgDtY2AMY,seeing this film in AVX will be epic

zyYgDtY2AMY,I Have a 6 cylinder 2007 Ford Mustang i already love this movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,Sign me up!!!! I believe this is the bio behind the GT40.
zyYgDtY2AMY,One of the greatest moments in Ford history
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I think I've gone back to watch this trailer every 2-3 days since it came out, I'm sooooo excited!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"You can't stop laughing at Americans. Before Ford GT40 won LM Ferrari smashed them 3 times... IN A ROW. And the winning GT40 was actually a British car, engineered by Brits, made by Brits and... with only US thing on it being the engine.
But in the end thanks to HF II the legend was born and Ford despite being blue collar hero can be considered as the only blue-blooded american car company with true racing pedigree (and 3 LM victories).
And have to say I love Fords (european ones of course that is) - they are miles more fun to drive than any other popular cars."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"You must make the movie wlhere japanese and jdm auto culture where all  started in a street racing gang called 
""midnight club"""
zyYgDtY2AMY,"My name is Caroll Shelby & performance is my business.
If this line isn't in the movie I want my money back"
zyYgDtY2AMY,2:13 Henry Ford II wasn‚Äôt ready
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This movie is gonna show everyone why Ford & Shelby deserves their reputation. 

R.I.P.
Lee Iacocca
And
Carroll Shelby

You men were truly pioneers of the American Automotive Industryüèéüí®üá∫üá∏"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"*Edit*

Chevy Corvette C8 Vs. Ferrari"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"As a car guy, I get fking hyped whenever I see racing movies"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"it's war
built a batmobile instead"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian Bale looks just like Hugh Laurie in the video thumbnail
zyYgDtY2AMY,CANNOT WAIT!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Glorified American Crap! If Ferrari was American you would hear Americans brag about it every single f day!
zyYgDtY2AMY,The future machinist. Dont do drugs trevor.
zyYgDtY2AMY,IF BATMAN HAS MADE A CAR YOU BETTER SEEN IT RUNNING BABY
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I wish it was me who wrote ""Gimme Shelter."" Hollywood would have made me rich! All the music in the world and they keep recycling the same half dozen songs for the ""intensity"" montage. GUARANTEED to be in the actual film also!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Okay I‚Äôm just gonna say it. John Bernthal doesn‚Äôt look anything like Lee Iacocca. Nonetheless, I‚Äôm definitely gonna see this movie."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Dramatic gear shifting is so 1980
zyYgDtY2AMY,Jon Bernthal is what makes me wanna watch this movie no cap
zyYgDtY2AMY,That last scene with Henry Ford II crying in the car cracks me up every time. :-))
zyYgDtY2AMY,what is the music called?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Yes yes yes!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Why Christian bale look like younger version of Harrison Ford 


ü§™ü§™"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I‚Äôm waiting for The Rock to make sequels where he reveals the best automakers were Samoans.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford offered to buy Ferrari and Ferrari laughed in their face. So, Ford beat them at their own game."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Next Koenigsegg vs Bugatti
zyYgDtY2AMY,I CANT WAIT TIL NOVEMBER!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"We urgently required another superlative Rush type racing film, with the Fast and the Furious movies spawning like xenomorphs this was definitely needed!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford v Ferrari: *exists*


Batmobile: *Am I a joke to you?*"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I think we can thank the Ace Man for this.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Looks good, as much as I like Bale...but no mention of Josh Lucas!
Will watch to see him play the bad guy!ü§©"
zyYgDtY2AMY,The sad thing is that all of us knows the ending.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Well you win for a few times, made a big deal out of it, make a big movie, enter F1 and LeMans every year. There's a company Stateside that makes sport/supercars only that sells thousands of units worldwide."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Millions of dollars and hundreds of engineers to beat, for one year only, one small car factory in Maranello... this film was intended to celebrate america exceptionalism  and it endend up as a spot for Ferrari. Enzo has won again"
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is gonna bomb
zyYgDtY2AMY,"My nipples get hard everytime I watch the trailer (drive Ford Mustang, convertible; hubby drives Ford's Bullitt. Driving my 5th Ford vehicle.)"
zyYgDtY2AMY,2:03 when Xvideos ask me am I over 18
zyYgDtY2AMY,"OK so batman , punisher , and guy who plays Loki character on stage .....
Things get weirdly interesting oh yeah"
zyYgDtY2AMY,It's a flat tire.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Here for Catronia Balfe although I see she has been mercilessly type casted
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Batman, The Punisher, The Rounder and cars, can't ask for more."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Anyone know what rating this will be age wise? Because the trailer suggests probably pg-13 but I just wanted to know if it‚Äôs been rated already
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ford=Money & balls / Ferrari=Brains & balls
zyYgDtY2AMY,Goddamn the gt mk40 is a beaut but cmon dude that Ferrari is just gorgeous
zyYgDtY2AMY,So looking forward to movie üöóüöòüöô
zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks epic
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I‚Äôm a simple fan. I see Christian Bale and Matt Damon, I click watch."
zyYgDtY2AMY,I see matt damon as leonardo dicaprio who else?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Will Doug demuro review it?
zyYgDtY2AMY,watch this in Hindi-  https://youtu.be/fSExE9bbIUg
zyYgDtY2AMY,This story was in Grand tour right?
zyYgDtY2AMY,People have the misconception that American car companies can't make badass cars. Hopefully after seeing this movie that will change.

zyYgDtY2AMY,"I don't think it will be as good as Rush, but thank god Fast and Furious crap is over."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"My uncle is Duane Carling and was an original Shelby member and he knew Carrol and was at the race at the pit crew, and he told us on how the race was a setup and Henry ford the second didn't want ford to win, so he setup the race and I know because I got a private tour of the Ford training center today and met many people that know and of course my uncle if you search him u will see"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Gta banshee
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Christian Bale? He's the fat, bald, old American dude who has a meltdown at the end, right?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Can't wait!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"this looks awesome and it's a true story that's terrific starting Jon bernthal as Lee I coca it's awesome,  fantastic,  and terrific."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Thank you for bringing us these films #20thcentrury
zyYgDtY2AMY,This movie gonna have more views than fast and furious
zyYgDtY2AMY,""" Ford Vs. Ferrari "" subtitle: Ken Miles wuz robbed. What a load¬†of bullshit¬†. This race did not happen in AD 1066, it happened in 1966 and is well documented. McLaren and Amon won fair and square."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Spoiler alert...Ford beats Ferrari
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon's sunglasses anyone? 1:40
zyYgDtY2AMY,0:52 Batman punches Jason Bourne üòÇ

zyYgDtY2AMY,The movie as already been BANNED in Europe.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Wait,  we have to make all characters women. Carol needs to be karen. Lee needs to be lay. Henry needs to be Hanna. Just to make the liberal left happy about gender equality!!!!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"0:47 Of course he doesn't trust him an inch, he shorted 1.3 billion on housing market‚Ä¶ duh"

zyYgDtY2AMY,And nobody could come up with a better name for the movie?
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This would be a bit more niche, but if we got a Group-B movie that would be next level..."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Hey, nothing against the Ford GT 40, and not that I dislike a movie about the magic of cars that does not evolve around macho one-liners and their slow-mo crashes through skyscrapers... but really, the ""American spirit outdoes European engineering""- clich√©?! üôÑ I'm sure it's entertaining, well-played by Damon + Bale, just sounds and looks like the eversame nostalgic self-image of American Exceptionalism!ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I hope they got it right. One of my favorite stories in racing history

zyYgDtY2AMY,This is as American as it gets except the revaluationary war!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,I think Chevy and Dodge have taken Ford's place in pushing boundaries with V8 fast cars. Ford don't make the Ford Gt with a V8 engine anymore they are going to EcoBoost junk.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Omfg this is sick!!

zyYgDtY2AMY,I can't wait to see this movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,One of the few current movies I‚Äôm actually going to see.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Carroll Shelby.  The greatest car guy in history.  Period.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I almost met Carroll Shelby at Lime Rock, Connecticut during the September classic meet in about 1993. It was a Shelby commemorative meet (all cars were welcome, otherwise my Citroen wouldn't have been allowed to enter) and there had to be about 400 of them in all variations, Mustangs, AC Cobras, you name it. I tried to get up close to get his autograph, he was happily doing that for anyone who asked, but I couldn't get closer than 20 feet away. At least I took his picture. All I can say, that man brought happiness to a lot of people!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I'm a simple batman fan

I see Bruce Wayne, I click"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Theater parking is gonna be a car meet.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"RIP Lee Iacocca. Oct 15, 1924 - July 2, 2019."
zyYgDtY2AMY,I was born ready! ; )
zyYgDtY2AMY,Nope.  Reference ‚ÄúLeMans‚Äù and ‚ÄúRendezvous‚Äù.  Looks like it will be a darn good addition  to the genre though.
zyYgDtY2AMY,You won't see Chevy vs Ferrari.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I can't wait till November....
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ouiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii !!! J'ai tellement h√¢te de le voir !!!

zyYgDtY2AMY,"ferrari:like
ford:comment
let's see what will win"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I was so proud when the Shelby plant moved to Vegas. That was literally when Vegas started changing for the better. We still have hookers, don't worry."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"All dislikes are from rich Europeans,and stupid rich douchebags that like Ferrari's. Sorry here for the real cars."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Wow this movie should of been out a long time ago ü§î
zyYgDtY2AMY,I have never been as excited about a movie as I am about this one!  Time to show Hollywood that racing fans still exist and we part with our money at an alarmingly quick rate if you dangle a trailer with cool race cars!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Its ok but the mark2 hung in  this move. But the mark4 dominated 1967.fact.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Something Oscar Worthy Coming Up!!! Damon v Bale...Ford v Ferrari Goosebumps!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Honestly the only enjoyable car movies for me has been:
1. Initial D third stage the movie and the rest of the series
2. Fast and furious: Tokyo drift
3. The fast and the furious (first)
Now hopefully this movie is great i couldnt possibly imagine so far that could be bad just as long as we get to see high tempo action"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Donut Media anyone?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Finally....this movie had to be made
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This movie seems very interesting, and the story is what I plan on looking into. Tbh I really liked the Need for speed movie. I just wished that there could be more movies on cars that dosent involve having the save the world, and tracing down the villains, (*cough *cough fast & furious series)


But this could be the start of a racing cinematic universe:
2019: Ford v. Ferrari
2021: Subaru v. Mitsubishi
2025: Chrysler v. Dodge
2027: Mclaren v. Lamborghini"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Shelby: _slaps roof of GT40_
This bad boi can fit so many *screams* in it"
zyYgDtY2AMY,And the value of every modern Ford GT just went up by at least 10%.   Looks like a great film.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Chills!!!!!!!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Now go make a movie about Audi vs Lancia
zyYgDtY2AMY,This movie certainly has a stacked cast. I‚Äôm pumped.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Happy to see real racing stories are pushed to Hollywood movies.  After #rush this would be another epic one. Thx everyone..
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Bale after test drive:
Does it comes on black"

zyYgDtY2AMY,Hopefully the first car movie to win the Oscar for best picture
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Me talking to my friend about this movie in 2017: They are gonna make a movie to have Ferrari losing to Ford at Le Mans. 
Him: Correct 
Me: And how long did they tell us that they needed? Two, three hundred years?
Him: Just 2 more years 
Me: ROFL"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"RIP Lee Iacocca
October 15, 1924-July 2, 2019"
zyYgDtY2AMY,song: The Rolling Stones / Gimme Shelter
zyYgDtY2AMY,RIP Lee - You brought the power to Americas muscle cars
zyYgDtY2AMY,Lee Iacocca will be remembered. I just hope he got to see this film before he died.
zyYgDtY2AMY,This film won‚Äôt even come close to the grand tour 15 min segment on this rivalry...
zyYgDtY2AMY,I know This will be my favorite movie of all time just by watching this trailer
zyYgDtY2AMY,ü§Ø
zyYgDtY2AMY,I just keep coming back to watch this trailer!  Cannot wait!
zyYgDtY2AMY,*My name's Carroll Shelby and performance is my business*
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon and Christian Bale WOW
zyYgDtY2AMY,"It‚Äôs awesome that they are teaming up with Ford. Here are the tech specs on the Ford GT40.

zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks awesome!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Oh yes I‚Äôm seeing this!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"One of these trailers that has reached a level of awesomeness, the movie will hopefully reach too"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ferrari wins because it's not a cheap piece of trash, with engines that explode on light impact or sudden stop HAHAHA FORD PINTO!!!
The movie should really be about how Henry Ford was a nazi, whose evil even Hitler admired.
Puts him in the same category as Muhammad and trump."
zyYgDtY2AMY,2:03 I was BOURNE ready
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Jason Bourne has started his own car business, maybe to for getaways from the CIA"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Who's here for Jon Bernthal???
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Nobody:

Ford:stonks"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"God I‚Äôm so glad I found this, and at a good time, too"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"i though this is "" le mans 66 "" trailer"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Finally a movie worth leaving the house to go see.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Why does Christian bale always look like he's smelling something nasty in the air.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Whats the name of the song. I like it
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Shelby : what do you think of the car ?
Bale : does it come in black?
Director: come on bale!! we shoot this scene for a whole month!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Once, when I went to see Ghostbusters with my mates back in 1984 during a quiet scene I did a loud fart. Me and my mates laughed hysterically for about 10 minutes.

It's funny the things you remember.

Christian Bale one of the great actors of our time."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"‚ÄúHow much weight can you lose for this movie role?‚Äù

Bale : ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Well ... I‚Äôm gonna watch it ... duh!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Finally a movie for car people
zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks so much better then endgame was
zyYgDtY2AMY,I NEED THIS SOUNDTRACK
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari ganha sem fazer esfor√ßos
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford, where‚Äôs my bail out?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Shelby and Ford the greatest cars and trucks ever FORD the American muscle
zyYgDtY2AMY,I can‚Äôt lie this will be an intense movie but I was really hoping to see something about Ferrari.
zyYgDtY2AMY,The word SHELBY ‚úåüëçüòéü§òüëåüëä
zyYgDtY2AMY,1:55 is that a flying Mercedes CLR ?
zyYgDtY2AMY,that's refreshing Hollywood is pick up a new premise called entertainment as long as they don't speak their mind and who they really are they'll get somewhere
zyYgDtY2AMY,Wow Adam Carolla's movie looks great
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian and Matt Damon? What more does  a movie need.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford in its prime selling the gen 1 mustang,thunderbird,galaxies and Ferrari despite being nearly broke was being its typical snot nosed self,
This has to be the most satisfying race winning streak of all time"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Damon is so ugly lol üê∑
zyYgDtY2AMY,"post credit scene 

Hugh Jackman enters with the silhouette of a sleek looking car behind him.

"" Good Afternoon Gentlemen, Ferrucio Lamborghini
, nice to meet you all."""
zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm here for BATMAN.ü§©üòçüòç
zyYgDtY2AMY,@ 2:18 i started laughing when he cried
zyYgDtY2AMY,I smell Oscars and one is Best Picture
zyYgDtY2AMY,James May deserves some credit for this being made! Definitely inspired by his video package on The Grand Tour.
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is better than Hobbs & Shaw.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Hype!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"That's it, I'm going to hop in my Pontiac and go hunt down a Chevy!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks like a Ford advertisement. I wonder how much Ford must have paid for it !
zyYgDtY2AMY,The movie we all ford lovers are waiting for
zyYgDtY2AMY,Can't wait to see this movie. :-)
zyYgDtY2AMY,"And....cue all the comments written by henpecked lads with neuticals for nuts who want to sound like they know what they are talking about but drive their 3 kids in a Prius or 2nd hand Lexus SUV and never over 80mph.  

(Sigh).

Looks like a cool flick."
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is it boys
zyYgDtY2AMY,looks like fun
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Funny thing is in Good Will hunting Matt Damon is wearing a red Shelby cobra jacket,an here he's playing as Carroll Shelby."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Movie looks great, but the title is a let down"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ford >>>>> Ferrari
zyYgDtY2AMY,Hope the movie pays credit to the üá¨üáßLola racing team as let‚Äôs be fair Ford basically took a Lola racing car modified it a bit then called it the GT40 i bet yall they conveniently forget this fact in the movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,this movie looks so unbelievably dumb
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Can‚Äôt wait to see it, however I hope its at least somewhat historically accurate and at least addresses Ferrari kicking the Sh!t out of Ford for years before this race."
zyYgDtY2AMY,These are the movies the world needs. About CARS!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"A whole lotta ""need for speed"" is gonna be satisfied come November."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I'm sure ol' Shell is just keeping his casket cool with the r.p.m. he's turning these days...MATT DAMON?? ARE YOU SERIOUS??? NOT DOES HE NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE THE ""SNAKE CHARMER"", He's the biggest anti petroleum snow flake out there! Man talk about miscasting!! Shelby's family should hold some one responsible for this terrible transgression.
Will i see the flick?? You bet! I've been craving a good sink your teeth into a high quality car flick for along time,...But Matt fuckin DAMON?   üòù"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"These days it doesn‚Äôt take much to beat Ferrari. Hell, they‚Äôre beating themselves!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,MURICA
zyYgDtY2AMY,I just can't wait
zyYgDtY2AMY,Last scene just won my heart
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Finally, a movie that looks promising."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"what type of engine did this car have again? also, even though im a chevy guy, I still want to watch this movie."
zyYgDtY2AMY,I seriously can‚Äôt wait to see this!!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,This ones gonna be good.
zyYgDtY2AMY,It‚Äôs funny because barely anyone knows this story
zyYgDtY2AMY,Donut did it first!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Based on a real story of 1966 race (the Rolling Stones song recorded in 1969 plays in the background)
zyYgDtY2AMY,Best trailer of the year so far.
zyYgDtY2AMY,It's nice to see Bale not having to fake an American accent...
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Matt damon yeah boyy, i miss him"
zyYgDtY2AMY,It looks so good. I just wish they had used a different colour palette to give it a more vintage feel....
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari > Ford
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Now a days Ferrari is just meh... The Ford modular family engine has surpassed even Ford ... Saleen S7 engine , Koinegsegg V8 modualr engine ...all are but modified Ford motors which rapes other exotics in terms of performance"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Is tat how Ford Shelby got it's name
zyYgDtY2AMY,Jims burgers!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Fab üëå.. but should wait till November
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This movie looks so good I cant wait to see it. Christian Bale actually looks very similar to Ken Miles I cant say Matt Damon looks like Carroll Shelby but based on this trailer he has the swagger to pull it off. This is a true story when America could put forward it's best effort and take on anyone. Anybody who is going to see this I recommend they watch the Movie ""The 24 Hour War"" beforehand it is the story about the Ford vs Ferrari battle."
zyYgDtY2AMY,FERRARI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!‚Äôüèéüèéüèéüèéüèé
zyYgDtY2AMY,Imagine a pro like Bale having to work alongside a borderline retard like Damon
zyYgDtY2AMY,I smell an Oscar
zyYgDtY2AMY,Which song's playing in the background?
zyYgDtY2AMY,ŸÖÿ™ÿ¥ŸàŸÇÿ© ÿßÿ¥ŸàŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÑŸÖüò©üò©üò©üñ§üñ§üñ§
zyYgDtY2AMY,It's changed from le-mans to FordvFerrari
zyYgDtY2AMY,But Christian Bale Has Lamborghini Murcielago
zyYgDtY2AMY,Produced by ford motors??
zyYgDtY2AMY,Might be the first decent movie in quite awhile!
zyYgDtY2AMY,I despise Ford for a number of reasons but I would watch a bootleg copy of this
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks epic!
zyYgDtY2AMY,They should edit out the stupid ‚ÄúI was born ready‚Äù line and the dumb crying scene
zyYgDtY2AMY,""" i'm batman"" ..."
zyYgDtY2AMY,10/10 will watch 100 times.
zyYgDtY2AMY,They need to make a movie on the history of American muscle cars
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Finally!! A movie about cars again, instead of flying through Dubai buildings üëåüèºüëåüèº"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"""Do you think you can beat Ferrari"""
zyYgDtY2AMY,"After reading about this movie, I just can't wait!! What creators said : ‚ÄúThis is David vs. Goliath vs. Goliath,‚Äù Christian Bale told theplaylist.net. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the industrial Goliath with Ford and the charismatic Goliath of reputation with Ferrari, and then this true story of the triumph of the misfits.‚Äù Director James Mangold described the film as ‚ÄúButch and Sundance in the world of racing,‚Äù Mangold also described keeping the racing scenes realistic. ‚ÄúI wanted to see a racing film where the cars weren‚Äôt all digital creations [and] we were really out there on the track. And not just so we could talk about it when we‚Äôre doing press, but because it actually makes a physical difference when you see it on screen.‚Äù"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Well, this looks absolutely fantastic and Bale really resembles Miles !! He is an outstanding actor, each of his roles - Bale becomes a different person. His lines delivery - perfect, I just love the way he says ''look out there, out there, is the perfect lap''. Can't wait !!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm going to the theater.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Bout time a movie worth really anticipating to watch.  So can't wait
zyYgDtY2AMY,SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY.
zyYgDtY2AMY,What? Hollywood is going to make a movie people actually want to see? Surely... It will be canceled...
zyYgDtY2AMY,"The GT40 was of coarse a British car, designed and built by Lotus, Lola and Cooper, and assembled in Slough, UK, and badged up as a Ford, looks like that will be glossed over in favour of ""Hollywood history""."
zyYgDtY2AMY,That part at the end with the guy screaming and then crying will be worth the ticket price alone.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford Front Desk-""Yes, hello?  Sir?  I was able to get a hold of the Ford Foundation, Shelby Foundation and the estate of Ken Miles.  Let me connect them to the call.""

Ford Foundation-""Ford here.""

zyYgDtY2AMY,2 horrible human beings.
zyYgDtY2AMY,hollywood junk crap. Good for the imbeciles of humanity. Lmfao
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon channeling his Jason Bourne at the end of this scene üòÇ
zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks great and all but I have to ask what's on everyone's mind. Where's the diversity?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Owned Ford Laser and then Ford Lynx Special Edition before married. Ford always in my heart.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"directed by martin scorse...        no, wait."
zyYgDtY2AMY,2:14 *that's a 5 second penalty for weeping like a child*
zyYgDtY2AMY,Wasn‚Äôt this just called Le Mans ‚Äò66?
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This is why I love Ford more than any other car company. Ford motor company strives to always be the best. Ford is driven by blood, sweat, tears, and pure will. Can‚Äôt wait for this movie"
zyYgDtY2AMY,#breathtaking üòç
zyYgDtY2AMY,Is it releasing in India
zyYgDtY2AMY,Who else laughed their asses off at the end??üòÇüòÇ
zyYgDtY2AMY,So excited ima kick the Chevy right in the dodge Haha

zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian Bale looks like Noel Gallagher in the thumbnail
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Family, god, country. üá∫üá∏"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Somewhere.the James May is happy
zyYgDtY2AMY,if anyone wants spoilers.....watch donut media ford gt.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"While I like this story, this movie looks too dramatized and the CG on all these crashes is too much."
zyYgDtY2AMY,So no one is going to mention Porsche's dominance and make a movie out of it?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Really? Matt Damon as Carol? What a joke.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari is back
zyYgDtY2AMY,Why Nov 15 I want it soon
zyYgDtY2AMY,One person in there that probably is going to be a little over locked was Lee Iacocca one of  smartest and intelligent businessman of our time. He took Chrysler which was an inch of going out of business not only save them and paid back the government loans well ahead of time. Great businessman only come on every once in a while he was one of them.Once again no offense to you trump fans who think he‚Äôs such a great businessman which he is not.lee Iacocca forgot more about running a business Then Donald Trump will ever know sorry to get political but that‚Äôs just the truth
zyYgDtY2AMY,Now this is a movie I wanna watch!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Does this mean that batmobile is a ford
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford v Ferrari
BMW v Porsche 
Dodge v Chevy 
Koenigsegg v buggati 
Even though they sound kinda boring"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Mr Wayne?
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Jason Bourne = Carroll Shelby
Batman = Ken Miles"
zyYgDtY2AMY,We hate Matt Damon
zyYgDtY2AMY,The GT-40's weren't lighter than the P3's but they were faster but whatever. The GT-40 is simply the most beautiful car ever made period!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Watch the 24 hour war if u can find it...Tells the whole story and it was great...Found it cuz of this great trailer
zyYgDtY2AMY,"The grand tour did an amazing segment about this. Season 1, episode 6 I believe. It ends the show. Some of the best TV I've seen in ages."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"ok, was the only time Ford beated Ferrari. Make sense to make a movie then.. üòÇ"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Yessssssssssss. I real tear came down my face. Thank the Car God'süíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è

zyYgDtY2AMY,Yes yes yes Yes YES YES YESSSSS YEAAAHHHHHHSSSSS!!! üòÜ
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Next up: 
Ferruccio: *Birth of The Supercar*"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Imagine if McQueen was still here today, and had a guest appearance as one of the rival racers. 


Your dearly missed Steve McQueen"
zyYgDtY2AMY,It's American and it's FORD....
zyYgDtY2AMY,It is about bloody time.... one of the greatest untold American victories
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon! Deal killer for me.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I guess that everyone forgot that Porsche exists
zyYgDtY2AMY,The s*** was miscast
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Hmmmm Christian bale

 i m on it"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"‚ÄúI was born ready Mr Shelby,...hit it.‚Äù"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I like how they make a movie of one of the only times Ford has beat Ferrari
zyYgDtY2AMY,When i see Mr Bale it's remind me of Batman and of course A Lamborghini. This movie should about Ferrari Vs Lamborghini!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,F**k yes.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I can see ut already. This movie is toxic. Why dont they make shelby a woman
zyYgDtY2AMY,"FFS, enough with the CGI cars already. They look ridiculous."
zyYgDtY2AMY,The movie plays ‚ÄúGimme Shelter‚Äù and the director ISN‚ÄôT Scorsese? What world am I living in?
zyYgDtY2AMY,F?ck matt damon... That is all!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I‚Äôm loving that they are making this movie
Looking forward to see it
But I must say that the last scene is a little bit too exagerated
This car made 5,2 seconds from 0 to 60
This car had less acceleration and lateral g‚Äôs than some sporty diesel sedans from today
I can understand that in that time
Feeling a 5 seconds 0-60 acceleration felt amazing
But the scene seems like he is on a jet fighter pulling 9-10 g"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Good movie I hope you download it full
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ferrari:What petrol did you use? 
Ford: Petronas
Ferrari:Wait,that's illegal!!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Oscars : how many award nominations do you want for this film Mr bale and Mr Damon 
Mr bale and Mr Damon : Yes"
zyYgDtY2AMY,As a car enthusiast I'm so excited for this movie!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"A brummie, took to the wheel of the ford!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,A lot of scenes in teaser trailers don't make it into the final film release.  Maybe they will scrap the scene with the petrified crying Ford executive.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Not my kind of movie but definitely and interesting concept.
zyYgDtY2AMY,It is that one time in history that Ford rubbed the 1-2-3 LeMans win in Ferrari's face.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Good casting. Not really a Christian Bale fan but he looks the part in this - and even has Ken Miles Brummie accent. It seems historically accurate too (obviously the story will have dramatic scenes for entertainment) but it seems someone has done their research.


I actually *can't wait* to see this!!!!!!!!!
..."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Rip Shelby. Also thank you Enzo for making Henry Ford II mad as fuq
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Carol shelby, the absolute king of all AMERICAN FORD HORSEPOWER!!!!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Jason Bourne, the punisher, and batman film."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"0:40  ""Well you can buy speed"" Whole movie summed up right there."
zyYgDtY2AMY,I‚Äôm curious how the Daytona coupe will be handled in this story. I think the Cobra-Ferrari Wars was a fantastic story and this feels like its going to be something near what happened but not actually that. I‚Äôm not sure what the timeline is when he said it but it‚Äôs like bales character is laughing at the prospect of ford beating Ferrari while Ford is currently beating Ferrari...
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon's face at the end!
zyYgDtY2AMY,But will it be better than James Mays movie about Ford v Ferrari

zyYgDtY2AMY,After The Martian im so used to seeing Matt Damon talking with food in his mouth
zyYgDtY2AMY,Best Picture of the year. COME ON OSCARS!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"If this movie doesn‚Äôt have a scene with Carole Shelby going ‚Äúmy name‚Äôs Carole Shelby and performance is my business‚Äù, I hate it"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"To think, all this came about because Enzo Ferrari doesn't want to relinquish control over Scuderia Ferrari.  Some car company have racing team to raise prestige and to show up their prowess.  Scuderia Ferrari have a car company because Enzo need a revenue source to fund the team."
zyYgDtY2AMY,The next one's gonna be Richard Petty vs. David Pearson lolüòÜüòÜüòÜ
zyYgDtY2AMY,Nice.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I dont care if you are a muscle car, exotic or tuner guy, you should know the name Shelby."
zyYgDtY2AMY,For a nanosecond I thought that was Mikey Day next to Damon in the thumbnail.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Did... did they change the name of this? Or did I get Bearenstained... I coulda sworn it was called Le Mans '66
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Every time I see Matt Damon, I don‚Äôt want to watch him act."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Italians dislike that.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Oh, so 20th Century Fox U.K. calls in Le Mans '66, but here in the States, it's Ford v Ferrari... A'ight!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I want to watch this so bad
zyYgDtY2AMY,"If we're making car history films, I wanna see a Lamborghini movie about Feruccio's life post WWII titled ""The Bull of War"" 

Or a Koennigseg movie about Christian's struggles and endeavors called ""The Spirit of Performance""

In a nutshell, titles that describe their founders' natures"

zyYgDtY2AMY,"I've always heard Ford II's name pronounced ""Henry Ford Two."" This is the first time I've heard it pronounced ""the second,"" which seems the proper way to me. Now I want to know which way Ford himself said it."
zyYgDtY2AMY,WOW I CANT WAIT FOR THIS TO BE OUT
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I wonder if Matt Damon gets to drawl, ""Ferrari's aiss iz MAHN!""?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Plot twist: This movie is in fact a sequel to 2013's Rush.
zyYgDtY2AMY,MOH POWAAAH BABEEEEEEHHHHH

zyYgDtY2AMY,"Matt Damon? He‚Äôs two feet too short! 

Tommy Lee Jones should have been cast as Ol‚Äô Shel. If only they could have spackled his wrinkles out (or in?)...."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Batman V Jason Bourne
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I grew up loving cars as a child, but I can't say the same anymore. Regardless I'll still see it when I get the chance"
zyYgDtY2AMY,One bit advise get actor sounds like they are england

zyYgDtY2AMY,its Just a shot away..... :) #SAMCRO
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks pretty gd awesome... I do NOT wanna wait until November.  (At all)...
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ferrari tried to sell out to Ford, deal broke down. Ferrari waffled too much. What was catylist for F40 GTO."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Cristian Bale looks like cringy version of Ken!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This move is a date night for sure, even if I'm by myself."
zyYgDtY2AMY,We need one for the Nissan skyline gtr r32
zyYgDtY2AMY,Better than Batman v Superman

zyYgDtY2AMY,For the sequel ‚ÄúLamborghini Vs. McLaren Vs. Corvette Vs. Porsche. Starring Jason Statham & Tom Hardy.
zyYgDtY2AMY,So it called lemans 66 or Ford vs ferrari?
zyYgDtY2AMY,American are so full of themself
zyYgDtY2AMY,Is it just me thinking that this is the reality of Cars the animated movie ??üòÖüòÖ
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ferrari: we're the best in the world
Ford: * Pats Ford GT * u sure about that"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"At 1:50 you can see the SAFER barrier in the background. My guess is that scene was filmed at Phoenix International Raceway. The barrier isn‚Äôt historically accurate, but I think it‚Äôll be a great movie."
zyYgDtY2AMY,The punisher and batman together!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Hi, please Watch ""VIBE"" on YouTube
https://youtu.be/OZdx-gm6bvc and tell.   @calniesha    what u think? dm her....üòâ ....also leave a message n like on her  youtube page! Thanks  for your support!! üòÅ"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Le Mans 66?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks great!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Christian Bale is a shape- shifting reptilian, turned actor."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari is the best
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I think people forget that Shelby beat Ferrari 3 times before the GT40 in 66.  In 59, Shelby won the 24 hours of LeMans as a driver for Aston Martin and then for two years before the GT40 from 64 to 65 with the Daytona Coupe.  Although Ferrari got the title in 64 because Enzo cancelled the last race (he had the clout and he had the FIA in his backpocket) so Shelby couldn't take the championship...but in my books, Enzo got scared and wimped out.  However, in 65, with Bondurant and Gurney at the wheel, they spanked Ferrari and won their class and took the championship including the 24 of LeMans.  Ken Miles was Shelby's tester for the 63 Cobra and then became his top driver thereafter. Also, I think Damon is the worst choice to play Shelby.  Shelby is over 6 feet tall and Damon is just a tiny speck of dust compared to Shelby.  Bale has some resemblance to Miles but Damon looks way out of place.  And for those who think Ford was behind Shelby's car...you couldn't be further from the truth.  Shelby went to see Ed Cole at ""GM"" first but he wouldn't give him an engine because GM didn't want competition for the Corvette.  So image if GM had given Shelby his engine.  We'd all be singing a different tune today."
zyYgDtY2AMY,As long as we're not rescuing Matt Damon again I'll see this in the movies.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Even this shows how Ford wins, I bet even Ferrari enthusiasts would enjoy this movie."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby?  I like Matt, but c'mon, he doesn't look anything like Shelby.  Christian Bale is a good choice for Ken Miles."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Finally.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Jimmy Kimmel has left the chat
zyYgDtY2AMY,2:20 - God I miss that feeling of ecstasy...
zyYgDtY2AMY,oh come on....Matt Damon?
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I loved ""Gimme Shelter"" best in Layer Cake. Perfect use! Nice trailer by the way...Christian Bale is the best!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,S
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is why I like Ford. You don't see most other car companies doing this. Ford took the latest GT racing and beat everyone first time out. Thanks.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Next movie Ford vs Tata üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
zyYgDtY2AMY,My balls just grew by 35 psi watching this
zyYgDtY2AMY,I am the first one to notice that the acronym is FvF... like Fast Furious... Coincidence or subliminal marketing?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari is better than ford
zyYgDtY2AMY,Another stupid Hollywood formula movie derivative of all the other crap already copied..
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon's acting has somehow become subpar. I cringe watching him now.
zyYgDtY2AMY,https://youtu.be/twB3DNsLajk
zyYgDtY2AMY,Can‚Äôt wait for this movie to come out! It‚Äôs actually a very interesting true story. These guys are gonna hit it out of the park!

zyYgDtY2AMY,"Jeez... Gimmie Shelter... they‚Äôve over used this, actually took me right out of the trailer"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Hollywood finally made a better racing movie than Fast and Furious
zyYgDtY2AMY,"RIP Carroll Shelby.

zyYgDtY2AMY,‚úÖ
zyYgDtY2AMY,FORD GT40 MKII üòç

zyYgDtY2AMY,Anyone knows the name of the first soundtrack at the beginning of the trailer?
zyYgDtY2AMY,I've been waiting for a movie like this forever!! <3
zyYgDtY2AMY,The Punisher & Batman: GIVE ME A HELL OF YEAH!!üò±üò±üò±üò±

zyYgDtY2AMY,Absolutely epic!!! I cannot wait to watch this!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari got saucy and made them change the title
zyYgDtY2AMY,Now all we need is a Senna v. Prost movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is amazing
zyYgDtY2AMY,Well I can‚Äôt wait to see how this movie turns out. I‚Äôm a racing car fanatic. Specially from that generation of Le Mans.
zyYgDtY2AMY,terrible movie title.
zyYgDtY2AMY,So is this just a fast car movie or is there any explosions or military vehicles trying to hunt you down?
zyYgDtY2AMY,*doug demuro has entered the chat*
zyYgDtY2AMY,YASSSS! The greatest story in motor racing history is finally being told!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"The right tittle to this movie would be ""Money wins everything"""
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I'd be excited for this movie but then they go and use the same goddamn music. Get new music trailer makers. This ""copy the last guy"" thing is getting old. There's a million songs out there, stop using the same ones to invoke a response of the 60's or the same one for magical stuff happening to kids or the current popular Kanye song when people need to be cool in a scene. It's as bad as Ave Maria over a gun fight. Stop it."
zyYgDtY2AMY,....Yeah the great Carrol Shelby !!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"How Long do you need to lose weight
Me - 200, 300 Years.
Christian Bale - 90 Days."
zyYgDtY2AMY,I hope this film is in League with Rush (2013).
zyYgDtY2AMY,"In the thumbnail, it looks like John Stamos playing Ferrari."
zyYgDtY2AMY,*chills*
zyYgDtY2AMY,"""So, are we getting ripped, obese, or anorexic for this movie?""
""I'm going to need you guys to just look normal for once"""
zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks like the greatest movie of all time.
zyYgDtY2AMY,First interesting trailer I‚Äôve seen in years!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks like fun
zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm definitely gonna see this
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Shelby:  ""I'm Carol Shelby,  and performance is my business.""
Patrick Bateman: ""What kind of card stock do you have that on?"""
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Me:im not watching a stupid movie 
about cars there‚Äôs a ton of those 

Movie:Batman,frank castle and Jason  bourne are in the movie 

Me: credit card or cash?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I don't know if Jimmy approves of this.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari p3 was the main villain to ford gt40
zyYgDtY2AMY,will be the best car movie since Rush!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ken miles was a driver of tank in world war 2 and from there he was into the testing of AC motor sheby
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Legendary car
Legendary actors"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Fun fact, the Ford GT was based off a previous racing car, a British design which had previously raced at Le Mans, but when it did race it suffered from being rushed out having its gearbox badly tuned. 

Ford bought that design, had Shelby make improvements to the car in the UK, before racing it in Le Mans."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Is christian bale the greatest actor ever?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Brilliant!   I have never wanted to see a movie this much.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I Ike Ford, specially Shelby Cobra or any Ford RS models..but I would love ‚ù§Ô∏è üíó to have Ferrari."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Crash like senna
zyYgDtY2AMY,christian bale best batman ever !!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Definitely gonna watch this bc I own a Ford Fiesta and we have Ford Fiesta Community where I live lol
zyYgDtY2AMY,"BATMAN,
PUNISHER,
JASON BOURNE,
In one movie????
Possible!!!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,USA 1. Ford 1....
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Was that Alec Baldwin in make up? If so, no thanks!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford isn't a car, it's a truck that's made to look like a car. Detroit's bankrupt for a reason. 50 lbs crankshaft and Push-Rods, it's extremely inefficient. They get smoke by 4 cylinder cars all the time..."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Also Don't forget Bruce McLaren, he stand on the podium as champion."
zyYgDtY2AMY,CARROL FUKIN SHELBY!!!!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Wow üòç
zyYgDtY2AMY,Hey the Punisher is in this movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,Its a very interesting take on a very inspiring and emotional story
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Great trailer, both great cars. But, here's the thing: Why is anyone shocked one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world at the time, was capable of beating a relatively small racing company who only made road cars so they could race? It's a 7 litre engine in the same class as a car with a 4 litre engine, pretty obvious who has the advantage. If you think about it objectively, if the Ferrari's V12 was 7 litres and the GT40's V8 engine was 4 litres, it's pretty obvious who would win. Never mind that Ford spent what, 360 million pounds (459 million USD) to do it... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXuqMt5aDes"
zyYgDtY2AMY,i wish the movie was Zastava vs Datsun
zyYgDtY2AMY,Were they really intentionally running each other off the track back then
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Of course ford wins,  given it is a Holywood movie pleasing its domestic audience."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ohh.. Thank god for this üôèüèºüôèüèº
zyYgDtY2AMY,"First

zyYgDtY2AMY,I just can't get enough of Christian Bale - This guy is insane !!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Can't wait for ""Ford vs Ferrari"" in November.
I'm looking forward for the movie."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Bale as Miles? Yeah. Damon as Shelby? No. Bernthal as Iacocca? No.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Just waitin here for them to make a Rush 2 with Aryton Senna(The Number 1 ) vs Allain Prost. 
Racing movies still have too much to go."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Bale the body transformer
zyYgDtY2AMY,Shelby is my favorite car. Really excited for this movie.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Jason Bourne, the punisher, and The dark Knight."

Matt Damon. The most overrated over paid actor in history."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This should be the next film made...

zyYgDtY2AMY,I really hope they show the pits and braking system swaps that Carrol devised. Maybe the key to the success at le man. God bless.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Hell yeah brother, cant wait for this"
zyYgDtY2AMY,He gone cry in the car... ü§®
zyYgDtY2AMY,It is a great story - I was around at the time - but the idea that they would punt each other off (at 1.56) is nonsense. Motor sport was lethal in those days.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Watched 'Good Will Hunting' and 'American Psycho' just 2 days before the trailer. Now they are together. BRAVO!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Give me a 1967 Ford Falcon anyday!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"1. Grand Prix (1966)
2. Le Mans (1970)
3. Rush (2013)


Motorsport and racing films I've seen that actually hold quality with no F&F bullshit (though they're enjoyable admittedly). Here's hoping this film makes it with these films."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Man vs God , Horse vs lightning ,  brick vs masterpiece , Hollywood vs. the Void"
zyYgDtY2AMY,This comment section is gold.
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is the first time I'm hearing Bale use a British accent since The Prestige
zyYgDtY2AMY,White car 98 is similar to Lightning McQueen
zyYgDtY2AMY,Sweet a movie about Carol Shelby
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Imagine a cinematic universe with all the notable car engineers, designers, CEOs, racers appearing in the movies which covers a certain story from the motosport history."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Now this is a true Super Hero story
zyYgDtY2AMY,This will be a great movie.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I much prefer Matt Damon and Bale

zyYgDtY2AMY,"You'd expect that after this historic moment in Ford's history, that they would be more empathetic to newbies in the industry. I'm talking about Ford and Tata."
zyYgDtY2AMY,0:35 subtle but powerful acting. You can tell Matt Damon was thinking.

Christian Bale is by FAR the absolute best Batman ever! That role fits him like a glove!
Side note: Ben Affleck was the worst Batman ever (nothing against him. That‚Äôs just not his role type)."
zyYgDtY2AMY,So excited
zyYgDtY2AMY,"They have to make a movie about group B now, please!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,BATMAN COME BACK . PLEASE !!

zyYgDtY2AMY,"So basically all of those legendary rivalries in motorsports somehow involves ferrari in one way or the other.
When is the Enzo vs Ferrucio movie coming?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,The Shelby Cobra is one of the greatest sports cars ever made! You can buy a replica for 250K. An original will cost you a lot more!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Matt Damon,"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Why they'll watch the movie: legendary cars, legendary actors, great piece of history....

Why I'll watch: The ROLLING STONES..."

zyYgDtY2AMY,"Bale and Demon are awesome.
Candidates for the next Oscar.."

zyYgDtY2AMY,Back when Ford was actually ambitious. Now is about making money and just selling cars.

zyYgDtY2AMY,FoMoCo
zyYgDtY2AMY,This better be as good as it deserves to be

zyYgDtY2AMY,im ready
zyYgDtY2AMY,I just wish someone would make a movie about  Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost's rivalry that would be *EPIC*
zyYgDtY2AMY,I hope the producers. screenwriters & cast had talked to A J Foyt & Bob Bondurant ; they were very much a part of the Ford racing team.

Please wake up and spread the word and do your own research, stop believing others"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford GT40: Pretty much done beating on Ferrari.
Porsche 917: I'll take from here.


Also 24 Hours of LeMans is held in June, ""Gimme Shelter"" wasn't released untill December of 69."
zyYgDtY2AMY,now this is one I'm gonna watch.
zyYgDtY2AMY,My favorite part is the 1:40 mark... Ken Miles‚Äô door opened... details like that are what‚Äôs going to make this a hit!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Gimme Shelter? Really? How many times can they use it? A lot of songs have been released in the past 40 years.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Producer: What should we call this movie?
Writer: it's about a Ford vs Ferrari
*Perfect*"

zyYgDtY2AMY,Favorite movie 100%
zyYgDtY2AMY,"They really could've found someone better to play Carroll Shelby. Besides, I thought Matt Damon was in his safe space down in Australia because he hates Trump."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Until an Lsx swap pulls up..
Jk"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Omg. What a cast $$$$$$
zyYgDtY2AMY,I probably shouldn't be as excited as I am about this movie.  I've watched the trailer about 20 times.  I might just watch again.......................................
zyYgDtY2AMY,I wonder if they have completely ignored the fact the car was based on the British Lola Mk6 and that is was designed and built in England. I notice that in some of the shots the car is right hand drive so they haven't completely rewritten history.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Where my *#MustangCrew* ??!! üêéüí®
zyYgDtY2AMY,Oh hell yeah!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Awesome.. can't wait

zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm Batman...üòé
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I'm not an expert on cars, but I assume this is the story of either Shelby GT or the Mustang? Or are they the same car, I forget XD"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"As amazing as this story seems, at that time:

-Ferrari employed 450 people and was able to build around 600 cars a year
-Ford Motor Co who was producing 2.1 million cars a year and employing 175,000 people


Spoiler Alert: Goliath Won ü§£"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Its not the brand. It's the motor.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I'm a GMC girl, but am excited to see this in November."

zyYgDtY2AMY,Isn't that Stones song a little tired by now?
zyYgDtY2AMY,"2400 dislikes, likely all Italians, hehehe"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I couldn't care less about the subject matter, and seems like a classic case of taking something that's barely emotional and making it over dramatic for the purpose of a quick cash grab. That being said, I might watch it..."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Forza Ferrari Cazzo Ford
zyYgDtY2AMY,FIRST DAY FIRST SHOW (FDFS)

Can't wait to watch this"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Another great movies for true petrolhead after rush
zyYgDtY2AMY,I almost forgot to watch this today.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Jesus Christ it‚Äôs Batman.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Would LOVE to see this movie, but Mutt Damon got into politics.....and pissed me off. I'll wait until I can see it for free. Too bad, have a pic of me as little kid w/Steve McQueen in our front yard, argued w/Paul Newman at Watkins Glen, and worked for Rolex. The pedigree is there, but the hatred for Damon is strong. Boycott it! MAGA"
zyYgDtY2AMY,WHAAAT
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ofcourse he is a good driver. That guy drove hell out of batmobile in Batman Begins
zyYgDtY2AMY,Yawl need to watch 24 hour war on Amazon Prime.
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is unnecessary
zyYgDtY2AMY,RIP Caroll Shelby 1923 - 2012 Lived to be 89 even though he had to take nitroglycerin pills to keep his Heart Going Back then.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I haven‚Äôt been to the movies in years not big on Hollywood but I think I need to see this movie

zyYgDtY2AMY,Fox‚Äôs final drama.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Exactly how many times Christian Bale will loose weight f**king crazily ...
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I understand 20th Century Fox has already contracted for a sequel.
Internet leaks indicate the title of the sequel to be
‚ÄúConglomeration of non-owner, disinterested General Motors employees vs Ferrari‚Äù"
zyYgDtY2AMY,üî•
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ford Focus RS the best rally car also.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Great idea for a movie. Too bad Matt Damon was cast in it. No chance of being successful.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Interesting concept/story to be told. And no Toretto. I like it.
zyYgDtY2AMY,They filmed the movie near a local burger place (Jim's burgers)
zyYgDtY2AMY,Kimmel gonna bully this trailer üòÅ
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Lol I‚Äôm rdy for grace from beyond the trailer to do the demographic break down as I already know this films isn‚Äôt gonna generate black people, or women for that matter. Well maybe women but not black people I can say that."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Sad we won't see adult movies now that fox is destroyed. Hopefully, other studios continue to be independent from Disney."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Spoiler: Ford beats Ferrari
zyYgDtY2AMY,Someone needs to clean up Jay Leno's drool after he sees this movie.  üòÄ
zyYgDtY2AMY,Anyone know what it‚Äôs rated? Looking to take my son
zyYgDtY2AMY,Um the punisher and Batman sign me up
zyYgDtY2AMY,His skinny again
zyYgDtY2AMY,2.4k Ferrari fans don't like this.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damien is shite
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks insane
zyYgDtY2AMY,Now this is a movie for me
zyYgDtY2AMY,I was born ready mister shelby üòÇ
zyYgDtY2AMY,I definitely want to see this. I love cars and I'm psyched that they are making this movie.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Hope they mention the (essential) involvement of Lola in the project.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"a movie with damon and bale, about the most epic car war of the two greatest car manufacturers in automotive history? take my money."
zyYgDtY2AMY,I have watched the trailer a few times now. Five months is gonna be a looooong time.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I‚Äôm so hyped
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Carroll Shelby simplemente ayud√≥ a Ford a complementar sus motores deportivos con la aerodin√°mica en los GT en los 60. Fue el cerebro de Ford. Eso desplom√≥ a Ferrari que una d√©cada dsp a los italianos los revivi√≥ un austriaco llamado Nikki Lauda y dsd entonces levant√≥ a Ferrari en el circuito F1. Pero sin ninguna duda Ford es el inventor del automovilismo por valer 10 veces menos y tener lo que tanto amamos, la bella sinton√≠a de un sonido de  V8, V10 y V12."
zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm more irritated that people miss spell Carroll Shelby's name all the time. Just say Shelby and call it good.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I gotta see this one.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Awesome - can‚Äôt wait to see it. Might rock up to the film in the Shelby üòâ‚úåÔ∏èüòé
zyYgDtY2AMY,I swear this song is in every trailer
zyYgDtY2AMY,Jesus Christ it‚Äôs Carroll Shelby!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Esta ser√° la mejor pel√≠cula para todos los fierreros!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"20th CF lineup- Christian Bale, Brad Pitt.. ‚úåÔ∏èüëç"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon and Christian Baleüòé They are going to ace it
zyYgDtY2AMY,"When Ford was great American company, started by one of the greatest American men."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ford GT price gonna sky rocket after the movie. (The old one not the new version).  They should make a movie about Lamborghini getting mad at Ferrari then making cars instead of tractors. The cars were better than Ferrari. Lamborghini could easily fund the movie too.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari had to agree to have there name on this movie and to use there cars
zyYgDtY2AMY,So Batman is a race car driver now?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Can‚Äôt wait to watch this
zyYgDtY2AMY,An all-out American movie. Just classic.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Batman v Punisher
zyYgDtY2AMY,I half expected Christian Bale to turn himself into a car this time.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks boring.
zyYgDtY2AMY,My name is Carroll Shelby and Performance is my business- Carroll Shelby
zyYgDtY2AMY,"AC Cobra my favorite, looks better than Ferrari too"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I‚Äôm not wearing hockey pads!
zyYgDtY2AMY,2:19 this is me when i see this trailer
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian Bales is such a perfect actor for the role of the late Ken Miles.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Less CGI than Rush, please."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"the way Matt Damon says ""thank you, sir"" is worth almost half of the entire trailer."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Caroll Shelby, a man with a womans name and need for speed."
zyYgDtY2AMY,üî•üî•üî•üî•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•
zyYgDtY2AMY,Can't beat RUSH
zyYgDtY2AMY,"So for those of you people who have no idea what this is. Well: 
1. Go kill yourself
2. THIS is one of the MOST LEGENDARY MOTORSPORT STORIES EVER! The 24 hour race at Le Man where Ford gave birth to the iconic Ford GT where the first version (which failed if I remember correctly) was called the GT 40 and then Ford learned from their failures and went all out and built the GT 40 Mark II which basically created the road legal Ford GT in 2005 and now in modern days the Ford GT 2017 edition. The GT 40 Mark II was what people called a ‚ÄòFerrari killer‚Äô because that‚Äôs exactly what it did. It killed Ferraris.

I hope all of you enjoyed this brief history lesson with me today üëç."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Love you Christina bale
zyYgDtY2AMY,Unfortunatly they won
zyYgDtY2AMY,Anti - American Matt Damon..... Why ?   Why not get someone else ?  Damon said he'd leave the country 2 years ago.  Why is he still here ?   I'll still watch the movie as it is history. And it's racing.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Thumbnail looked like Matt Damon and George Clooney
zyYgDtY2AMY,U should mention Jon brenthal
zyYgDtY2AMY,This might be the first car movie I want to see on the big screen.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"2:02 ‚ÄúI was born ready‚Äù ,, anyone remember this üôÇüôÇü§îü§î"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Oh YES!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Waiting to see how badly Hollywood f's this up. The Adam Carolla doc ""The 24 Hour War"" is well worth a watch before anyone sees the Hollywood version."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I hope AJ Foyt gets represented well in this movie, he is a hell of character and his life story is a movie all on it's own."
zyYgDtY2AMY,The movie opens with Matt Damon's lifeless body drifting in the Gulf of Mexico. He is saved by fisherman and the only thing he can remember is how to make cars fast and race them.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Thank you for the incredibly annoying, period incorrect song. Movie circa 1965, song circa 1970"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Last night it was 11th and now it's 35th as of this being posted SMH it should be higher than this.
zyYgDtY2AMY,When the movie is all about racing.....even MORE than the Fast and Furious movies
zyYgDtY2AMY,Shoulda been named Shelby verses Ferrari.
zyYgDtY2AMY,If only Ford's didn't break down all the time! 2013 car has been on the shop over 10 times
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ferrari doesn‚Äôt win anything anymore, not even in F1, and it‚Äôs making me sad."
zyYgDtY2AMY,That's why Batman never gets busted by police
zyYgDtY2AMY,Awe heck yah!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Money can buy any earthly thing, but will never buy the most important thing..., (fill in the blank)- ........................."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Cristian bale üî•
zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks dumb. The end of the trailer punctuated that home. Disappointing.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Sponcered by FORD & FERRARI
zyYgDtY2AMY,It's hilarious how hard Hollywood tries to hype you up and get you interested in movie ideas that sound meek. Sheep.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Most people don't even know the story. Hopefully it's as good as the facts. Awesome.üëç
zyYgDtY2AMY,"You ready?

I was born ready, Mr. Shelby; hit it.

Ok


aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Is there anything Christian Bale can't play? I couldn't imagine someone better to play Ken Miles.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Learned about that story on The Grand Tour, that was the most interesting and well made part of the entire show imo."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I still remember carrying groceries out for a lady and to my surprise she was in a Shelby Series 1 vehicle that wasn't released yet.  I was like how do you have this car?  She goes, do you know who Carroll Shelby is, he's my Grand Father."
zyYgDtY2AMY,This new Cars live-action looks good
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ferrari: we got a movie ford: hold my beer
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian Bale is just on another level.
zyYgDtY2AMY,There is something heartwarming and American about the sentiment that an every man brand like Ford creaming a luxury car in a race.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Testosterone on film.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"The result car was Ford Pinto




x cuse me"
zyYgDtY2AMY,The best story in corporate automotive history!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Like.ford v ferari
Comment.once up on a time in hollywood"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Will this movie clear out the conspiracies of the controversial finish of Lemans 66‚Äô
zyYgDtY2AMY,"‚ÄúFast and Furious is the best car/Motorsport movie of all time.‚Äù

zyYgDtY2AMY,"2:02, I was born ready, the best part of the Trailer."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Eric Bana would've been better than Bale I rekon
zyYgDtY2AMY,SHANE!!! you're alive
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Let's see if there's any HYPOCRISY here? Both of these guys HATE America, Capitalism, and are rabid environmetalists? But,They made a carbon footprint as big as California making the movie, as these cars use fuel like it's free! They agrandize Ford, a true Capitalist and American success story. And they've made millions personally from their Capitalist movie companies and their success. And I'm sure they flew their private jets to whatever locations were required. So why should we patronize them and their sick f***ed up thinking? Hypocrites at the highest level!!! WAKE UP! Great story! Evil actors! Sorry."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Batman's first batmobile
zyYgDtY2AMY,Nice to see Bale has nailed the Brummie accent

zyYgDtY2AMY,"Dear friends, please visit my channel and watch our team's short films..."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Well, as a historical film, I hope they at least tried to get it right. I'd like to see what caused this rivalry and the failures that ford had during the development of the race car. It Did not happen in 90 days."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Make a Group B movie lol
zyYgDtY2AMY,Spoiler : Ford win
zyYgDtY2AMY,Terrible casting choice.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Bale is one of the best actors ever. He can do any role and I believe him. Batman to this and it just works, not many actors can do that."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Tracy Letts is a unique actor. He's got Jeff Daniels' face & screen presence and the voice of Alec Baldwin.
zyYgDtY2AMY,U know Hollywood is running out of good ideas when they starting reading scripts from trailer parks or race fans lol
zyYgDtY2AMY,Battle of the FTM's.

zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon ruined this movie.
zyYgDtY2AMY,It's great that The GT40 in this movie is the actual GT40 from Le Mans on the 60s
zyYgDtY2AMY,Matt Damon making that man cry like that ! Shame!!!

zyYgDtY2AMY,"It's one thing to be able to enjoy Christian Bale not having to pretend to be American in a role, but it's a whole new level of joy to see him play a Brummie"

zyYgDtY2AMY,"I'm a car fanatic, but this looks like a real turd of a movie. I'll probably see it but they are overplaying it. Shelby and his team were worldbeaters. The computer generated graphics really detract from the reality of that era."

zyYgDtY2AMY,This is so sexist. There are no strong female characters in this. I propose a Girl-Cott of this movie!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Yeah That's Wassup
zyYgDtY2AMY,Any mention of the three New Zealanders who made this all possible? üëå
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Oh look, another trailer using GIMMEE SHELTER. How original."

zyYgDtY2AMY,Back when America made good cars .
zyYgDtY2AMY,Your gonna build a car to beat Ferrari with a Ford. INCORRECT.  It was built on a Lola Mk6 which was made by Lola in Britain.  Seems like they forgot the maby most important part of the team ? And they only went to Lola after trying to buy Ferrari.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian Bale and Matt Damon are still mutherfuckin studs!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ferrari : Ford can‚Äôt make a car to beat ours. 
Ford: Hold my beer."
zyYgDtY2AMY,YES!

There will be Spoilers"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This actually looks good to me 
I will see this as soon as I can once it‚Äôs out"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Cant wait
zyYgDtY2AMY,"There are so many racing stories to be told with heros in both the cars and the cars themselves.
 The next era of passion for life will be represented in movies like these epics."
zyYgDtY2AMY,The premise is dumb
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Okay so the movie industry is dying.

Hows your day?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Feels too hipster to me. I dunno. Obligated to watch but not too excited about the trailer other than they are trying to tell the story

zyYgDtY2AMY,*Tesla enters the chat*
zyYgDtY2AMY,Two of my favorite actors in one movie. I‚Äôll be honest in saying I didn‚Äôt even need to watch the trailer to be sold.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Bale lost 100 pounds from ""Vice"" to ""Ford vs. Ferrari"". 
The Machinist - Batman - Vice - Miles. 
This guy is something else, I can¬¥t even imagine the discipline he must have."
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is the movie that I've been waiting for my entire life.
zyYgDtY2AMY,They made it seem like Ferrari was some sort of colossus while ford was a small car workshop from the suburbs. In real life ford was the biggest car manufacturer in the world while ferrari never exceded 3200 employers and a yearly production of 7.000 cars.
zyYgDtY2AMY,the little boy in the beginning looks like young tom Holland

zyYgDtY2AMY,The look like the Gallagher brothers in the thumbnail.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"""you go out there and win le mans""

zyYgDtY2AMY,Were they inspired by the Top gear Special
zyYgDtY2AMY,He wasn't readyyy!!! üòÇüòÇü§£
zyYgDtY2AMY,I wonder/fear if the film makers will completely ignore the part the Kiwis had to play in this story? Bruce Mc Laren and Chris Amon (Kiwis) actually won the 1966 le Mans with Ken Miles and Denny Hulme (another Kiwi) coming 2nd.  And i also think it was Mc Laren who sorted the handling of the cars as Shelby mainly worked on the engine?  American film producers conveniently forget these facts.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Seeing as I‚Äôm building a shelby 427 cobra replica right now, I can‚Äôt believe this movie is coming out. Couldn‚Äôt be at a better time!!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"There is a Documentary called The 24 hr War about it, see it"

zyYgDtY2AMY,Spoiler: Ford beats Ferrari. A lot!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Batman V Supercar : Dawn of Distance
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This is definitely something to cure our post Grand Tour blues.

Also, it's already better than the next series of Top Gear."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Gone in 60 Seconds, TFAF, and now hopefully this. I want very much for this movie to succeed. Also, the batman jokes are hilarious."

zyYgDtY2AMY,First time in years I've been excited for something out of Hollywood. We need more car movies.
zyYgDtY2AMY,2:03 He was not ready
zyYgDtY2AMY,Need for Speed: ford v Ferrari
zyYgDtY2AMY,Batman and Jason Bourne:What a legendary team up
zyYgDtY2AMY,Spoiler.  Ford Wins.
zyYgDtY2AMY,These days I wait around for movies like this that I know will have great acting
zyYgDtY2AMY,fake effects look...fake
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I had extremely high hopes for this movie, and to be straight up forward i don‚Äôt think Matt Damon is suited for this movie. He just doesn‚Äôt fit the part and does not look like Carroll Shelby. And Jon Bernthal is not even CLOSE to Lee Lacocca! Again the part doesn‚Äôt fit him. This has an opportunity of become an amazing Movie!! There‚Äôs so much!!  Christian Bale is the only one that sort of fits his Ken Miles character. Don‚Äôt get your hope to high. I feel like after watching the movie, if you‚Äôre really a car enthusiast and know the history well, than you will be pretty unsatisfied with it.  Just watching the trailer am not to hyped about it."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"U think we will see lightning McQueen?





It's a joke"
zyYgDtY2AMY,This film looks promising great to see Matt Damon and Christian bale back on the movie screen

zyYgDtY2AMY,Rip my man shelby the car industry will never be the same without him
zyYgDtY2AMY,Meanwhile Porsche looks on and chuckles softly....
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Next, can we get a Tom Hanks, Ryan Reynolds and George Clooney tractor pull movie?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Yay i cant wait
zyYgDtY2AMY,Gotta wait till a Ferrari vs Lamborghini...!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"""Jesus Christ its Carol Shelby!"""
zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm just waiting for lightning McQueen to be like *_NYYYYOOOOOOOOMMMM_* to beat them all
zyYgDtY2AMY,The best anime battle in the history of movies

zyYgDtY2AMY,Funny because Ford looses the first time

zyYgDtY2AMY,"Next movie: *Freddy vs Jason 2*

Lol kind of hoping the versus movies come out now"
zyYgDtY2AMY,The world's longest and most expensive ad aka this movie.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I guess two legends in a movie is the hottest thing in the market rn
zyYgDtY2AMY,I'll bite.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Again...

In a world of racing films nothing, NOTHING can beat 1971 ""Le Mans"". It was rough, realistic and all about the race. Not about epic bullshit, f**king love story or smart asses with their stupid dialogues.

Today we have just that kind of things in films. Even 2013 ""Rush"" had a couple of such moments (but thanks to Niki Lauda it wasn't badly made).

But ""Le Mans"" was just perfect. I don't think someone will ever outperform it."
zyYgDtY2AMY,This a SNL Themed Title lol
zyYgDtY2AMY,I just hope this movie is good and inspires more studios to make racing movies.
zyYgDtY2AMY,This is awesome üòé

zyYgDtY2AMY,"...later in 2019: Ferrari is the most prestigious brand by Forbes, most F1 titles, and best performance in the world.
Meanwhile Ford produces economy family cars."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Seems more like Carol Shelby and Ken Miles Vs Ferrari would be a more apt title.
zyYgDtY2AMY,wow lawerence still remember dr burry from wall street huh
zyYgDtY2AMY,Finally a movie about something new. I‚Äôve been waiting on a movie based on Motorsports for a while

zyYgDtY2AMY,"Okay, Hollywood‚Ä¶ you got my attention.  First time in years."
zyYgDtY2AMY,But the real question is... was Ferrari and Ford Sponsors for the movie?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Beautiful if they made more movies I would ask for Mitsubishi V Subaru The Rally War.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks great and the soundtrack is on point as well!

zyYgDtY2AMY,Yee
zyYgDtY2AMY,As a member of the Shelby family all I can say is Matt Damon is so far from our family views. He is a liberal that will say and do what ever he can to get the popular view. We Shelby‚Äôs are believers in Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior and cherish our conservative family values. I am ashamed of Matt Damon and do not think he is a man of accurate revelation to our family.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I suppose the movie will be enjoyable and Ford will come out as a winner since it's an american movie. However, we all know who made and still makes the best cars: ferrari! USA's cars are inefficient and heavy"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I'm so excited for this. 

Next I want to see a Group B Rally movie. Make it happen Hollywood"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Martin scorcesi approves this trailer
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This film appears to have some promise...I was skeptical of Damon as Shelby, who was a larger-than-life figure in the history of the automobile but, he appears to have some swagger. Hell, just to see footage of these Golden Era cars on the big screen is enough to get me there.

And don't ever forget...the difference between Enzo Ferrari and Henry Ford, II? When someone crashed a Scuderia Ferrari, all Enzo cared about was the condition of the driver. When someone crashed a Ford racecar, all Henry cared about was the driver."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Im so gonna watch this movie
zyYgDtY2AMY,Already see things that were changed for cinema but I will still see it because it shows one of the greatest battles of racing history. Who‚Äôs playing Bruce McLaren I wonder.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Isn't his (Christian bale ) acting similar to that of his"" the fighter"""
zyYgDtY2AMY,Sassenach??
zyYgDtY2AMY,"The actual documentary, a very good real world scenes, about a driver in the today's motorsport - in World Rally Championship - Ott T√§nak The movie - https://youtu.be/3Z5mwq1NwDY    https://youtu.be/3UPhX57OgR4"

zyYgDtY2AMY,"Meanwhile In India
Tata Vs Mahindra üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I hope Matt Damon does a Carrol Shelby Chili commercial remake at the end
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Is there some contest in Hollywood to see who can use ""Gimme Shelter"" in the most movies?  Martin Scorsese already has it pre-programmed in every film he does....now everyone else too?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Why did i think of Takumi
zyYgDtY2AMY,you know...Steve Mcqeen will be proud.
zyYgDtY2AMY,This trailer has FIFA stench to it...
zyYgDtY2AMY,I think their running out of ideas

Only in Hollywood! Any normal person would have that on their record for life! Don't give your money to a man that hits women!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,1:03 is that pops from Riverdale?
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ultamite sleeper
zyYgDtY2AMY,last scene he pissed off
zyYgDtY2AMY,Police: its a black.... tank...
zyYgDtY2AMY,"At least we know,neither Ford nor Ferrari will win in this movie."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian Bale in the thumbnail looked like Bear Grylls to me . LOL
zyYgDtY2AMY,"- What's the retail on one of those?

zyYgDtY2AMY,Boooooo Hollywood elites........nah take my money lol
zyYgDtY2AMY,I thought the rivalry was between ferrari and lamborghini
zyYgDtY2AMY,"No wonder Henry Ford II poured more than a few fortunes in the Ford GT40 especially the Prototypes, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he had gone bankrupt! 

No doubt, One of the greatest rivalries in Le Mans!"

zyYgDtY2AMY,Pinto v Anything On Wheels
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford GTs went up in value by almost twice its original price, something tells me this is only gonna make them even more valuable. Doug DeMuro must be happy."

zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm sitting in my gt350 watching this trailer. I know he would be proud. If only he was able to drive this amazing car and see what his legacy created today. THANK YOU CARROLL SHELBY
zyYgDtY2AMY,The problem I see with tis movie is that sport/competition movies are usually about the underdog. They are about David beating Goliath against all odds. But The real Ford vs. Ferrari is about Goliath hiring a multi-national army to take revenge on David.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Hope they show that they needed British engineers and had to try 3 years at Le Mans to get any success...
zyYgDtY2AMY,Finally! A movie that I actually want to see.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Patrick Bateman at 1:19
zyYgDtY2AMY,Oooo ya

zyYgDtY2AMY,Cars 4 looks lit
zyYgDtY2AMY,Ken Miles was British. Looks good though.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Omg they were both at the Indy 500 and now they are making a racing type movie together... coincidence? I think not. (This is a joke they obviously planned the movie Months or Years in advance)
zyYgDtY2AMY,No crowds were harmed during the making of this film.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Who's here for bale
zyYgDtY2AMY,3 ford GTs cross the finish line taking 1st 2nd and 3rd place.
zyYgDtY2AMY,A movie couldn't possibly capture the rivalry of Ford and Ferrari.

zyYgDtY2AMY,Everything was going so well till Matt Damon showed up.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford really needs this video to do well, this is publicity that‚Äôs hard to find"
zyYgDtY2AMY,You made it about the actors and the CGI instead of the people the movie is about. You won't beat Rush with that.

Some see us as argumentative and prosecutors of the bad and less than. We are (or should be) the coolest people on earth for all the reasons opposite to those above. Why? Because JESUS was cool; yes, He was! Care without compromise, LOVE."

The Ten, will be on Amazon for free until Thursday. 

The Ten, is a futuristic short story that revolves around heroes whose spirits are connected to the mightiest entities to ever exist; in order to save the Human Realm from an extra dimensional fugitive with incredible power, ten individuals must merge with the Soul Arms, which will grant them the ability to access the might of their Spirit Guardian's former incarnation. 

The story begins by describing Patrick's journey, which begins with his criminal life. While traveling undercover with a biker gang, he accidentally ends up in a strange land; within it, he stumbles across a mystic weapon. The spirits attached to it inform Patrick of his bizarre destiny, which can only be fulfilled if he uses his newfound power to save the undead elders' descendants. 

Part 2 follows a king named Kalga, who rules over an isolated tribe within a galaxy that's distant from Earth's. When a royal blacksmith's stock is stolen by mindless-ravenous creatures, he kidnaps the only person that can help him; by arming Kalga with his destined Soul Arm, he's made ready to recover the creations from the magic-infused monsters."

zyYgDtY2AMY,Doesn‚Äôt look like much of that was set in England. Which given that‚Äôs where the car was designed and constructed is a little odd.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Looks good.  But let's face it,  Le Mons is the most boring car race there is."
zyYgDtY2AMY,The story of the Ford GT40
zyYgDtY2AMY,This would probably be better if the movie was from Ferrari perspective but go off I guess.

We demand Group B next!!!!! Audi Quattro vs Lancia 037
WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!
I am HYPED!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I‚Äôve been waiting for twenty years for Hollywood to make this movie.
zyYgDtY2AMY,go ahead patrol heads!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"I‚Äôm liking this movie but at the same time I‚Äôm worried, cause I already seen this story on the Grand Tour, and I feel this film is going to make Ferrari the bad guys and Ford the good guys, and keep it simple as that and not go into more good detail about it

I hope this film, it also shows why Ford went to war with Ferrari and show a scene in the film of Enzo Ferrari lashing out at Ford executives which leads to war

This film should start at Le Mans with Fords first attempt but fails and sees Ferrari on the podium, and have Henry Ford II going to Shelby and Miles to turn the GT40 into a a racing machine

But this is my take, what are your opinions?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks great!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Bourne Speedematum : One batch , two batch , a Penny and Shift !"

zyYgDtY2AMY,SPOILER : Ford beats Ferrari !!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Are you ready?

I was ""Bourne"" ready :v eh?"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Spoiler alert

In real life Christian Bale's character, Ken Miles, died on the racetrack from the car looping, crashing and ejecting Miles and killing him instantly. So suffice it to say this movie won't be all that light-hearted."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Oh look... Another America propaganda film...
zyYgDtY2AMY,I‚Äôm a big big fan love the ford GT 40 MK and 2005 - 2007 one as well cause what mad the GT was the V8 now back in 2017 I feel like they spat on  Shelby grave by putting a V6 in it yes it makes more BHP but it loses its heart they took out the V6 for the V8 cause it was less strain on the engines to keep up with the V6 Ferrari‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a race see who‚Äôs better the British - New Zealand - America vs Italy ford vs Ferrari ford GT40 designed based on the British lola mk6 and built in the UK with Shelby‚Äôs V8 and New Zealand racers to take the win. üá¨üáßüá∫üá∏üá≥üáø VS üáÆüáπ.  üèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅüèÅ

Neither does Jon Bernthal as Lee Iaccoca. I like both those actors, but I've heard Shelby and Iacocca speak, watched them in videos, etc. and Damon/Bernthal wouldn't be my first choice. Seen Miller in old films, but never heard him so no opinion there.  I'm pulling for this movie, so hopefully it will be a pleasant surprise."

zyYgDtY2AMY,This movie just can't be missed. Amazing trailer.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Looks like an epic film.  Important to note Ken Miles was leading the 1966 Le Mans race but near the end, in then typical Ford corporate think, the brass wanted the 3 leading Fords to slow down and cross the finish line 3 abreast.  This caused Miles to not win the race because the French race officials, in their infinite wisdom, said the 2nd place Ford, having started further behind, had been driven more miles and should win the race.  This deprived Ken Miles of his first Le Mans win and the triple crown (Daytona, Sebring, Le Mans) of Endurance racing.  Sadly, Ken Miles was killed while testing the prototype Ford J-Car at Riverside International Raceway just 2 months later.  The J-Car would be heavily modified into the the Ford GT-40 Mk. IV which won the only two races it was entered in, the Sebring 12 hours and the Le Mans 24 Hour races of 1967."

...
...

...
TAKE MY FU**ING MONEY!!! üòÉüòÉüòÉ"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I hope this will be as good as Rush.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Wasn‚Äôt expecting this...
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This is gonna be good, but INCREDIBLY Ford-biased. Keep remembering that Ferrari won most of the other races in the WSC!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Where's batmobile..? üòÑ
zyYgDtY2AMY,Kool
zyYgDtY2AMY,Noah Jupe is back.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH I NEEDED A MOVIE LIKE THIS TILL I SAW THE TRAILER!! :)
zyYgDtY2AMY,I was born ready üòÇüòÇ
zyYgDtY2AMY,Who's here before a million
zyYgDtY2AMY,"*Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne!*"
zyYgDtY2AMY,This looks great!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Dislikes from the Chevrolet crowd.
zyYgDtY2AMY,I'm just watching this trailer over and over
zyYgDtY2AMY,Comes out on my birthday :)
zyYgDtY2AMY,better than batman vs superman
zyYgDtY2AMY,That's right FORD vs. FERRARI was a thing when they used to use TRUCK ENGINE.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"3 of the coolest, greatest actors in a film. I'm here for it."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Every time I see Christian Bale, he's a different person."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Just like Rush but supercars
zyYgDtY2AMY,"the punisher, batman and jason bourne? take my money"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Talladega Nights II will be bigger than this.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks awesome!!!!!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Shake'n'Bake - I hope Ricky Bobby appears in this.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"This is the movie, this will be a classic; it is not an avengers movieüëçüëç"
zyYgDtY2AMY,I can already see it's gonna be fun as hell watching Damon and Bale play off each other.
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Is Christian Bale coming for taking his due Oscar they shamelessly give to that Rami Malek? 


Yes."
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Ford: Save......Mazda

Ferrari: WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME!!!!!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,Conquered me for this hilarious trailer end!
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Thank Goodness they still make movies like this.


HOPEFULLY Disney will keep this spirit alive now that they own the place.  MORE MID BUDGET VEHICLES!"
zyYgDtY2AMY,"Hopefully it's as good as Rush was, anyway we're overdue for a good racing movie."
zyYgDtY2AMY,Still weird that Fox is owned by Disney now
zyYgDtY2AMY,I‚Äôll bomb the academy if bale doesn‚Äôt win an oscar this year he should‚Äôve won it many times before
zyYgDtY2AMY,Looks soooooo good
zyYgDtY2AMY,So hyped for this!!! Getting all the Rush vibes!

zyYgDtY2AMY,This will be the greatest movie I have ever seen. Please don‚Äôt let me down!
zyYgDtY2AMY,That's a different team up.... Cool though. It is directed by the same guy that did Logan and Walk the Line. Mangold knows how to make a good movie.
zyYgDtY2AMY,Oscars are approaching!
zyYgDtY2AMY,Thought Damon and Bale were racing against each other for different motor companies. Bale on the wheel and Damon behind the scenes evades clich√©. LET'S GO!!!!!! üö•üöó
zyYgDtY2AMY,Christian bale n matt damon?? I m sold!!

MgbBwovOOoc,"So, this is a movie about a grown adult woman in her forties fucking an underage kid... and the movie is all about HER being a poor victim... riiiight.

I'd like to see this movie made with the genders in reverse."
MgbBwovOOoc,XD i love  your mothers cookies XD wow this seems like a bad lifetime movie...which i guess  would be a reagular lifetime movie XD 
MgbBwovOOoc,Why does she wear bad wigs in films?
MgbBwovOOoc,First I was like uh no than the action sort of happened and I was like hmm I'm getting curious I might watch it.
MgbBwovOOoc,5 bucks says the Dad is gonna die
MgbBwovOOoc," craptacular
http://www.torontosun.com/2015/01/22/review-jlos-boy-next-door-a-craptacular-thriller"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Il me tarde de le voir ce film, vraiment !! "

MgbBwovOOoc,Definitely love this. 
MgbBwovOOoc,@Lee Her wanna watch this movie. Jennifer Lopez is in it.<3 :)
MgbBwovOOoc,J Lo just needs to stop making movies. Every movie she does looks forced. 
MgbBwovOOoc,"I really wanna watch it because Ryan Guzman is in it ☺️ ""Things got pretty wet up here."" Omg I started dying 😭😂😂"
MgbBwovOOoc,Noah is a crazy psycho
MgbBwovOOoc,It's considered unethical for teachers to have relationships with their students...even if they're 30.
MgbBwovOOoc,"I LOVE YOUR MOTHERS COOKIES !!!  

lmfao"
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I Love Your Mothers Cookies"" lol"
MgbBwovOOoc,Looks ok
MgbBwovOOoc,Noah is so a sexy
MgbBwovOOoc,"Boy♂Next♂Door

Sorry, I had to say that."
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh. ... my. ... OVARIES!!! 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊
MgbBwovOOoc,Reminds me of a Lifetime movie...
MgbBwovOOoc,the guy reminds me of jack gilinsky from vine 
MgbBwovOOoc,"""It got pretty wet here"" 😂😂 at her face! Yup, for go see it now!👏👍"
MgbBwovOOoc,"This movie is wrong. Wrong on the level that an old hoe slept with a high school student and is now ""the victim"" he's just showing what she did was wrong... And that he's obsessed with her. Fuck this world. "
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,What is that song?
MgbBwovOOoc,"*of course, leave it up to jlo, to make a movie about men chasing after her, ego much?yessss."
MgbBwovOOoc,the *creepy* boy next door
MgbBwovOOoc,"From the trailer it looks like the movie has a great mix of humor, creepiness and drama. I must see this"
MgbBwovOOoc,Introducing Jennifer Lopez's new husband
MgbBwovOOoc,Okay.........................................................................................................
MgbBwovOOoc,I cant wait to see this movie look interesting.
MgbBwovOOoc,"Awesome! Finally a movie to educate the mindless masses on the horrible male students who sleep with their poor helpless teachers. Especially since evil male teacher who seduces poor innocent female student has been done to death, right? Doesn't really matter what the story is, if there's a man, there's a villain, if there's a woman, there's a victim."
MgbBwovOOoc,Well it got pretty wettt here...the look on j - Lo ' s face priceless
MgbBwovOOoc,Is this movie based off a book?
MgbBwovOOoc,Am I the only one who thought the hero man was James Franco??
MgbBwovOOoc,Whispering-Alex Clare makes this so much more intense! 
MgbBwovOOoc,That looks like a movie Helen McCrory would be in
MgbBwovOOoc,What kinda high school teenager looks that old? Like seriously... -_-
MgbBwovOOoc,young derek (every teen wolf fan will get it)
MgbBwovOOoc,The sex looks hot to me.... I don't care about the ages
MgbBwovOOoc,Old hag has sex with a teenager and somehow she is still the victim. Feminism!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,I can't wait to see the movie.
MgbBwovOOoc,No words to describe this ._.
MgbBwovOOoc,Can't wait to see this movie 😃😀
MgbBwovOOoc,What's the song??? pleaseeeee
MgbBwovOOoc,Ian nelson😍💕💖💖
MgbBwovOOoc,Definitely got to see this!
MgbBwovOOoc,"Darek,thanks god freaking love young Derek!"
MgbBwovOOoc,SOOOOOOOOOOOOO READY 2 SEE THIS!!!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,I can smell the bad acting from here.
MgbBwovOOoc,"A teacher with her student. Hmm sounds interesting. I'm going to watch this movie if possible (and I hope so) just to know how it works in the end. Be it happy, or sad ending. Or, unpredictable ending. And to be honest, to watch Jlo and Ryan Guzman as the perfect human beings."
MgbBwovOOoc,Is that guy from step up 4 ?
MgbBwovOOoc,"Wow. There is no reason to see the movie after a trailer like that, which gives away the entire storyline and leaves no mystery.  This looks so predictable. Also, from what I see in the trailer it looks like terrible acting all around. This should be a Lifetime Channel movie. And women that sleep with 16 year olds, even when they look 27 (terrible casting there), are not victims. She should lose her job and go to jail.  She deserves no pity and if her life is threatened she should turn herself in for the pervert she is. Sleeping with someone in their teen years that is close to your child's age is pathetic! Have some control and use a vibrator if you are that desperate... I am sick of seeing real cases like this in the news. *gags*"
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,Young Derek Hale!! 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Im only gonna see this for one reason: To see JLO in another movie where she does a sex scene. Her movies may be crappy but she's still fine as fuck so she'll be nice to look at for a hour and a half, lol"
MgbBwovOOoc,I love your mother's cookies. 
MgbBwovOOoc,"This is so freaking creepy! Like Honestly, would anyone want to watch a movie about a man who tries to ruin a womans life because she pushes him away? Like da fuq people"
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie looks terrible. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Cant wait until friday to watch this movie... ! 
MgbBwovOOoc,Enough
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies""
""It was pretty wet up here"""
MgbBwovOOoc,Damn!! that boy is twisted :( 
MgbBwovOOoc,Omg... i must see this movie! 
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks so fucking stupid.
MgbBwovOOoc,I am going to see the movie 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Just to clear the air
A Milf, is a mother you would like to firetruck
A couger is an old woman who would want to firetruck you
JLo is a MILF (still not in the couger age"
MgbBwovOOoc,"The boy playing her son,He played as young Derek on teen wolf right?"
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie looks like a cliche fanfic 😂😂😂i love jlo though 
MgbBwovOOoc,jlo awesomeeeeeeeeeee
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ah! "" I love your mothers cookies"" 😱😩💋🔥👋👋😻"
MgbBwovOOoc,"I know some people love Jennifer Lopez, but seriously name me one movie she's been in that was a success?  There may be one, but I can't think of one.  This movie box office draw is purely her name.  For a woman her age she gorgeous, but that doesn't equal acting talent."
MgbBwovOOoc,I've been dying for this movie. I love Jennifer Lopez and everything she is in. <3
MgbBwovOOoc,Okay! Say I'm gay. If there would be such a young and cute guy so obsessed with me and try to control me! I would love under his dark side~ 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Okay jennifer I think I speak for many when I say enough ! Is enough. With the crazy white boys stalking you movies , I mean we already know that you can beat up a few people or whatever , but dayum walk the walk if you talk the talk . The movies you make depicting you as the victimized latina by crazed Caucasian mem who seemingly obsess over you have become annoying as hell. If you are so interested in dating white men in real life , why do you demonize them in film??. Really is sickening come up with a different topic or plot for your movies. It's time for something new. Also you are getting older and these male costars look younger than you by like ten years , get it together."
MgbBwovOOoc,"Her to husband ""There was a big thunderstorm. You guys didn't get it up there?""
Husband ""No""
Noah ""well it got pretty wet here""
LMAO"
MgbBwovOOoc,I Had no idea jennifer lopez was that sexy in a drama? 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Nothing new here. ..looks like another Jennifer ""bomb"""
MgbBwovOOoc,This is crazy move 😮
MgbBwovOOoc,When does this movie come out
MgbBwovOOoc,Cougars are disgusting kill them all😷😷
MgbBwovOOoc,Too many movies have too much sex in them anymore...its getting annoying. Although this does look very unnerving
MgbBwovOOoc,"""Boy next door with Jenny from da block"".... "
MgbBwovOOoc,"this looks stupid,  so farfetched!!  lol."
MgbBwovOOoc,"Displaying men as obsessive psychopaths even though it's socially acceptable for girls to cry at One Direction concerts, cut themselves because Bieber smokes weed, try to look like the victim when cheating in a relationship while men become human punching bags after being caught in the act of such an atrocity, etc... Only in feminist America."
MgbBwovOOoc,Omg people get over yourself. We all know we would fúck someone as hot as noah....and it's a movie stop hating YA bootys
MgbBwovOOoc,"I honestly clicked this trailer thinking it was a Fun , Comedy movie but i feel so violated right now. "
MgbBwovOOoc,I am 10 years old and I have been having to watch this video over and over and it is very inappropriate 
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,Hate this movie so much
MgbBwovOOoc, http://www.gofundme.com/kbkpag
MgbBwovOOoc,Wow this is disturbing. JLo is trying way too hard trying to act like an 18 year old..
MgbBwovOOoc,Best Comedy of 2015? Can I get an AMEN? Hell Yes.  
MgbBwovOOoc,"It dose look really good just like she played in ENOUGH. This will be the movie I will definitely buy when it comes out on DVD.
Jennifer Lopez is a good actress strong and determined to keep bad guys away "
MgbBwovOOoc,I wouldn't mind messing around with a women older then me and that looks like jlo. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Noah is hot and creepy at the same time
MgbBwovOOoc,What do you call the second song?
MgbBwovOOoc,"LOL. Of course Jennifer Lopez would want to play this role. But in all honesty, this trailer was so loaded, I do not even think it's necessary to go and see the movie now, pretty textbook."
MgbBwovOOoc,"Stilvoll mit einer tollen Atmosphäre inszeniert. Ich finde Lopez ist zwar immer noch keine herausragende Schauspielerin, aber sie wird stetig besser.

Rob Cohen hat dies überraschenderweise ohne große Effekte und Action inszeniert. Ich finde es toll, das es noch handgemachte Filme gibt. Das Genre Thriller ist auch eine große Bereicherung im Filmgeschäft.

Ich freue mich gewaltig auf diesen Film, da ich mittlerweile diese vollgestopften Filme hasse, mit möchtegern Schauspieler, schlechten CGI-Effekte und übertriebener Action.

Solche geradlinigen Filme mit echten Schauwerten und soliden Schauspielern, brauchen wieder viel mehr im Kino!"
MgbBwovOOoc,young derek hale<3
MgbBwovOOoc,This bitch is still making movies? She should know by now that she can't act
MgbBwovOOoc,nooo ryan guzman:(
MgbBwovOOoc,Is it bad that I actually laughed at this trailer??? 
MgbBwovOOoc,J LO and Kristin Chenoweth!!!!!!!! 2 incredible talents. 
MgbBwovOOoc,"I can't watch this, my childhood crush J. Lo!!!!! Nooooooo!!!!!"
MgbBwovOOoc,The Noah dude is really attractive lol
MgbBwovOOoc,Excited to see this! Looks intense!
MgbBwovOOoc,I can't wait to watch this going with a group of ppl lol but looks so intense excited :) 
MgbBwovOOoc,It's Ian Nelson (the son) from teen wolf he used to play the young Derek *.*
MgbBwovOOoc,Enough part 2 
MgbBwovOOoc,Can't wait to watch this movie
MgbBwovOOoc,It is so fucking stupid that you can't skip this 30 second ad but you can skip the 30 second ad that is about education. WTF screw this movie.
MgbBwovOOoc,"Any teenaged boys who say they wouldn't bone the shit out of JLo is either gay or a fucking liar lol.
We all had that one hotass teacher we wanted to be on. The dude in this movie is living your teenaged dream lol.
Honestly,  if he wasn't batshit insane,  he could have gotten in that whenever he wanted lol. First time is always the hardest :p"
MgbBwovOOoc,"LOL @ ""I love your mother's cookies"""
MgbBwovOOoc,"This movie has a really good story line. It kinda disturbs me the fact that a high school boy just falls in love with a woman that already has a son. But it disturbs me as a good way. (I don't think that makes any sense.) overall, pretty cool. "
MgbBwovOOoc,He is delicious. God damn
MgbBwovOOoc,hahahah.ITS JUST A MOVIE PEOPLE!!!LOL
MgbBwovOOoc,"This movie....  This movie,  gives me the biggest chills.  I'm a guy,  but this is frightening to think that this actually happens, happens to woman all around.  Just makes me so uncomfortable. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"What if this were 'The Girl Next Door' 
Definitely a gender bias smh"
MgbBwovOOoc,"This is like ""Obsessed"" but its the other way around. (Girl is obsessed with happily married man) although they are the same age :P"
MgbBwovOOoc,Just another version of Obsessed...
MgbBwovOOoc,So she's a phys. ed teacher having sex with a guy she barely knew... Okay wow
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,It ain't like fear in fear Reese and mark were dating at first he cheated she dumped him then he showed his true crazy colors. Nicole 4 Eva
MgbBwovOOoc,Dam can't wait till it comes out!
MgbBwovOOoc,Anyone think of the movie fear?
MgbBwovOOoc,why is Jennifer Lopez so needy?  why does she have to have someone in her movies tell her she's pretty?  i'm over her.
MgbBwovOOoc,"Lmao got pretty wet here
I love your mothers cookies
Holy shitt xD"
MgbBwovOOoc,Can't wait till the 23rd!!!!!!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,will check it out
MgbBwovOOoc,"After watching this extended preview, I realized that she knew he was a high school student. That changes everything. I mean the guy playing the kid, looks like he's well into his 20's so I was thought that the premise might be that she thought he was a college student or something and then found out otherwise. With this plot, it's a whole lot messier. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"I have ZERO sympathy for that whore endangering herself AND her son, how hard is it to NOT lead someone on? Reap what you sow"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ella dice que queria un actor latino? si como no! por eso elijio a un moreno piel canela/oscura (sarcasmo). A pesar que este actor tiene raices latinas nadie lo ve como latino en hollywood, lo ven como blanco! jaja"
MgbBwovOOoc,Cant wait to see this movie looks incredible.
MgbBwovOOoc,"Just a movie , dam people be taking shit far"
MgbBwovOOoc,Didn't know JLo could act. When I first saw this commercial I thought she was Alex Russo's mom (wizards)
MgbBwovOOoc,This trailer strangely pisses me off. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Ryan Guzman is smoking fucking hot! That's all I got! 
MgbBwovOOoc,Uhh you dummies take this movie so serious like stfu and chill. Yes this shit happens in real life but damn calm down. It ain't you so why you worried about other people.??
MgbBwovOOoc,1:12 young Derek from teen wolf
MgbBwovOOoc,Only watching because it was filmed at my school 😂 Birmingham Community Charter High School!!! #patriots
MgbBwovOOoc,It doesn't say if it's pg or anything does anyone know if it is?
MgbBwovOOoc,"Hollywood guy to another Hollywood guy.....""OK, I've got an idea for a film, and I think its got SERIOUS Razzie potential.....""  Leaves meeting to receive BJ from J-Lo in parking lot...."
MgbBwovOOoc,Based on a true story by Roman Polanski?
MgbBwovOOoc,"If the studio could come up with a Drinking Game for all the poor choices in this film, well then they'll have a hit."
MgbBwovOOoc,"oh great another female teacher student romance movie. Notes on a Scandal is soooooo much better if you are looking for a spook, but why is there a lacking of movies with older men who do the same? I knew 0 older females in high school compared to 4 older males taking advantage of high school ladies. THAT is disgusting and lame of hollywood to promote this perception of female teachers when their male counterparts who do the same do not get reprimanded as much for their behavior (unless of course they molest boys). "
MgbBwovOOoc,"is tribute to naughty america
""MY HOT TEACHER""   ?"
MgbBwovOOoc,Still a better love story than Twilight...
MgbBwovOOoc,"Can someone answer this for me, What's the story towards the end of this, where the dude is like ""It's me, the boy next door"" and things appear ""Normal"". Can someone explain this to me??"
MgbBwovOOoc,It's baby Derek from Teen Wolf!!! #onlyonewhonoticed 
MgbBwovOOoc,The Middle-Aged Man Next Door
MgbBwovOOoc,Yes! This movie looks soo good! I can't wait I'm definitely going to see it when it premieres. It reminds me of a fanfiction i've read and since im a fangirl i must. This movie... I swear it specifically for the fangirls all around the world xD  The Noah kid is so damn sexy and i cant waaait to experience that sex scene! xD (is all this a little weird coming from a 14 yr old?) looool 
MgbBwovOOoc,i wanna see this bad:)JLo is a Good actor especially in Enough movie she was Awesome 
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies"" 
""It got pretty wet down here"" 
I lowkey wanna see this movie for the one-liners alone😂😂😂"
MgbBwovOOoc,LOVES IT! HAHAHAHHAA
MgbBwovOOoc,I will watch this movie.. I dont care with you guys
MgbBwovOOoc,jennifer lopez is no michael douglas 
MgbBwovOOoc,"""Well it got pretty wet here"" lmaooooo"
MgbBwovOOoc,"THIS BOYS COME BACKS
It got pretty wet here
I love your mothers cookies "
MgbBwovOOoc,Man if J Lo let be do that i'd be down in a heart beat
MgbBwovOOoc,I want to see it >:D
MgbBwovOOoc,If roles were reversed the public would be shitting itself and Tumblr would meltdown
MgbBwovOOoc, looks like a porn video and then after the guy caught feelings
MgbBwovOOoc,"If I were her I'd be so scared, I mean how would you know that hottie teen was a psycho."
MgbBwovOOoc,Lisa Ann should star instead of J-Lo here
MgbBwovOOoc,"That dude is weird. Not stalker weird. He's just weird for the whole movie and as a main role. At times his male sexuality that the role is supposed to exude is just off. Like, gag. "
MgbBwovOOoc,Parece que va a estar buenasaaaa
MgbBwovOOoc,haters below me specially Female haters to Janiffer lopez must calm their fucking tits down. its a movie and he is not fucking underage cos in a really life no way that dude is 16 yrs old or even 25 yrs old......
MgbBwovOOoc,FORSENBOYS
MgbBwovOOoc,"Okay, people need to lighten up, calling her a Pedophile? I know under her circumstances since she appears to be in a marriage (not sure cause the crazy dude said something about the dad walking out) and has a child, and obviously this boy is insane, that the whole situation is rather fucked up. But I think out in the real world though, 2 consenting adults (I am assuming the boy is 18) regardless of age difference should not be looked upon as the older one being a pedophile. This movie seems interesting, and I like how it pushes the envelope of what we're comfortable with. It clearly seems to be doing it's job, getting all these reactions from people on just the trailer alone."
MgbBwovOOoc,"your Support  thx ..    teasers from the new project on ‪#‎Instagram‬!! Even catch a little glimpse into the studio with my team and I creating ‪#‎Freakshow‬!! Excited to share with you guys the behind the scenes footage as well!! ‪#‎comingsoon‬!!

MgbBwovOOoc,Besides everyone's bad remarks I actually am looking forward to seeing this! Lol
MgbBwovOOoc,Total girl movie. Can't wait to watch it.
MgbBwovOOoc,Kinda is the plot of a porno......except the obsessed part
MgbBwovOOoc,Looking forward to jlo kicking serious ass in this movie
MgbBwovOOoc,estoy esperando los días para ver esta película 
MgbBwovOOoc,IT GOT PRETTY WET HERE LMAO I'M GOING TO SEE THIS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT LINE. I DON'T CARE IF IT SUCKS. THAT LINE MADE MY DAY.
MgbBwovOOoc,He is fine
MgbBwovOOoc,He can be obsessed with me anyday
MgbBwovOOoc,"mmmmm, my main boy from Step Up franchise is a bloody badass here!! And those abs plus the steamy scenes... slurp2, got me hard for a minute.. XP XD"
MgbBwovOOoc,"stalker boy: i don't know but it got pretty wet around here

MgbBwovOOoc,"It ""obsessed"" in reverse..."
MgbBwovOOoc,Finally another movie by J-lo and not that singing crap. I hope she continues to make more movies cuz she's my fav actress! Can't wait so watch it!
MgbBwovOOoc,The title it sounds like one of wattpad story. So curious about this movie.
MgbBwovOOoc,AWESOME!!! I cant wait
MgbBwovOOoc,This why some parents need to monitor they children 😂😂😂
MgbBwovOOoc,the boy next door which is named noah is really a creep and wont leave claire alone
MgbBwovOOoc,"And all that shit just for some pussy
smh"
MgbBwovOOoc,"I thought this came out like, 5 years ago.  Wait, I watched another trailer that has dial-up modem sounds in the background, so... maybe 15?"
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks so bad.
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ryan Guzman is awesome, but JLo ... Ugh"
MgbBwovOOoc,"So many people misinterpreting the trailer so much!lol hahaha first of all this is a movie obviously everything this isn't based on any true story!!lol second, for the movie to be more realistic of course they gotta use characters/actors like that so it doesn't matter if they be different ages cuz its not real, its just acting!!like what do u guys want the same age woman or man but a different age in the movie??like serious that'll be unrealistic??!! Lol third, I see people saying this movie is promoting/ its OK for a older woman to have an affair with a young aged guy or the movie is making him the villain but not j.lo and its not fair cuz she was in it too??SLAP YOURSELF PEOPLE!!! Stop jumping to conclusions if u haven't seen the movie yet!...SMH "
MgbBwovOOoc,IAN NELSON
MgbBwovOOoc,"Yeah, it's perfectly fine for a female teacher to sexually assault a male.  Basically that's what this film is saying.  It makes the teen male the villain and poor JLo the victim.  I'm sure Mary Kaye Laturneau will love this film.  The double standards make me sick"
MgbBwovOOoc,"*""Well, it got pretty wet here.""* 
*""I love your mother's cookies.""*
LOL this trailer is just full of dirty jokes!"
MgbBwovOOoc,i think you people need to chill talking shit about either of the actors its a damn movie and its called fucking acting look it up if you have trouble understanding. why not just enjoy the show
MgbBwovOOoc,Awwwwww Little Miguel is in here i hope hes going to come back into Teen Wolf Season. 5
MgbBwovOOoc,Milf.
MgbBwovOOoc,"""love your mothers cookies...""
that wasnt a corny line..."
MgbBwovOOoc,looks interesting 
MgbBwovOOoc,When are they gonna start casting people who look remotely the age of the character they're playing? This dude is 27. High school? LOL
MgbBwovOOoc,Almost like Stolen the book
MgbBwovOOoc,this kinda reminds me of Enough
MgbBwovOOoc,"J-Lo at best, and truthfully love young boys.  This is an off-spring of Enough.  I won't bother watching, to each his own."
MgbBwovOOoc,co-starring real-life BOY toy CASPER SMART
MgbBwovOOoc,Can someone please tell me what noah says at 1:18? would be amazing ♥
MgbBwovOOoc,Yes!!! I gotta see this! 
MgbBwovOOoc,Older women and younger guys are just not my thing. I don't ship it.
MgbBwovOOoc,He looks like a young version of james franco
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ohhhh, I wanna see it. Noooow."
MgbBwovOOoc,It appears from the clip she is not aware he is a student or underage. He is a neighbor then he shows up in her class and she is shocked. At any rate it reminds me of Enough. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Lol. Something something Roles reversed.
MgbBwovOOoc,funny.  woulda been better without the horror film twist.  its interesting enough
MgbBwovOOoc,Kereeeeeen filmnya. Jadi ga sabar pengen nnton. 
MgbBwovOOoc,can't wait!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,"I better see some ass or some titties or something, just kidding, this movie looks pretty decent to watch, but it's like Tyler Perry's Temptation, she cheats and the guy is completely obsessed with her. "
MgbBwovOOoc,Omigosh its young derek from teen wolf!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhh
MgbBwovOOoc,I WANNA WATCH IT 
MgbBwovOOoc,OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK.. WAIT. WHAT THE FUCK. WHAT THE OMG THIS IS FUCKING CREEPY.
MgbBwovOOoc,I kinda want to wtch this.
MgbBwovOOoc,MUST WATCH !! 🙌
MgbBwovOOoc,I wanna see this. That guy is hot!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,Dang I wanna see this only to see what its like
MgbBwovOOoc,"""Do you remember my order?
3 tacos 2 tostada and a soda pop"""
MgbBwovOOoc,"Most young teenage boys look up videos/images of females on line that are r-rated, women that are fully developed, not flat chested teen age girls lol ...some young boys prefer women who are experienced. From what I get from the movie if was chasing her, not vis versa... that or he has mummy issues lol"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Okay, I know it shouldn't matter but it would be nice if they cast a latino actor to play Jennifer Lopez's husband. In the past, her love interests have always been white and as a latino myself, I just want to see more latino couples onscreen. Adam Rodriguez, Benjamin Bratt, John Leguizamo, Oscar Isaac or even reunite her with her ""Selena"" co-star Jon Seda to play that part. Regardless, I'm still going to see this movie because Jennifer Lopez is an entertainment icon whom I respect so much."
MgbBwovOOoc,"This is the most unrealistic looking movie ever. I'm way more chiseled than this guy and mature women never invite me to their place...Rather watch human centipede with my family while eating spinach,"
MgbBwovOOoc,*Laughs* I love your mothers cookies. Lmfao!
MgbBwovOOoc,Finally Hollywood has made a love story I can relate to.
MgbBwovOOoc,Interesting...will be watching 👍
MgbBwovOOoc,wanna see !
MgbBwovOOoc,"He can be my neighbour.....,"
MgbBwovOOoc,27 year old guy and a 42 year old woman don't really go together but I guess anything is possible in Hollywood :/
MgbBwovOOoc,So she hooked up with a high school boy....? Hey I'm in college JOo 😜😜
MgbBwovOOoc,"J-lo's tired old butt needs to be the old mom who comes in only when the family dinner scene is playing. Who can take this seriously. She has an ego the size of a planet , making all these movies wow"
MgbBwovOOoc,Love your mother's cookies... Bahaha
MgbBwovOOoc,Bruh 0-0 the guy is sexy I'd screw him anytime XD
MgbBwovOOoc,This Really intense like Wtf? 
MgbBwovOOoc,Soooo a pedophile high school teacher has sex with a student and is still the victim. Amazing !!
MgbBwovOOoc,"*rolls eyes* I've seen the *EXACT SAME* plot a billions with much better actors. The *BEST* one is ""Fatal Attraction""(yes, I am that old :P). This is *NO* ""Fatal Attraction"". It's more like Disney's laughingstock version of ""Fatal Attraction""."
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ok...So this is basically ""Enough"" part 2..??"
MgbBwovOOoc,Yeah nobody is buying that he's a teenager 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Just like ""Enough"" I think it'll be interesting and to some it may relate, but JL is an awesome actor (in my opinion) and I love her movies. <3"
MgbBwovOOoc,dang.... this shows that one mistake can change over your life
MgbBwovOOoc,2:15 IM SOLD
MgbBwovOOoc,"kinda scary., ryan G. 
i love your mother's cookies.. -noah
men., meaningful"
MgbBwovOOoc,What song is in this trailer? It's very catchy.
MgbBwovOOoc,So basically a one night stand that turns her neighbor into a yandere. ._.
MgbBwovOOoc,"""it got pretty wet here"" 
me : OOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HE WENT THEREE"
MgbBwovOOoc,J lo really loves them young guys lol
MgbBwovOOoc,We need more male yandere characters god bless their souls :')
MgbBwovOOoc,this is exactly like the movie enough.
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks so damn bad every time I see this trailer I cringe multiple times
MgbBwovOOoc,"This reminds me of the movie fear, except the female is an adult while in fear the female lead was still young and her parents didn't trust the guy, either way fear was a good movie so hopefully this one is too :)"
MgbBwovOOoc,Ew. What the actual what. 
MgbBwovOOoc,this guy looks like james franco!!
MgbBwovOOoc,Those puns are something else lmfao
MgbBwovOOoc,Everyone needs to chill it's called a movie and they're called actors for a reason.
MgbBwovOOoc,I know what I'm going to see for my birthday
MgbBwovOOoc,F O R S E N B O Y S 
MgbBwovOOoc,OK Ryan in HOT ❤
MgbBwovOOoc,"Looks like an awesome movie, can't wait to see!"
MgbBwovOOoc,So......he's basically a yandere........that's cool xD
MgbBwovOOoc,She gonna give him some taco-flavored kisses
MgbBwovOOoc,this is a good trailer
MgbBwovOOoc,50 Shades If Rippedoff
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie would be cool...only if the plot hadn't been done dozens of times. Anyone remember the 2009 film Obsessed?
MgbBwovOOoc,LOL the R rated version of Jack .RIP Robin Williams 
MgbBwovOOoc,it sounds so good and I really want to see it soooo bad!
MgbBwovOOoc,You guys its a fucking movie! It's not real!
MgbBwovOOoc,My Name Is Billy McCovey Ladies Can Share Their THOUGHTS With Meeeeeeee....  Aye I Just Say.... INIT
MgbBwovOOoc,"So Hollywood is going to put out propaganda to demonize teen boys that sleep with older women (who happens to be his teacher). Typical women are angels who are so stupid they can be easily seduced by a evil teen boy, cause men are evil.  This is a shameful movie.  I'll gladly bootleg this movie."
MgbBwovOOoc,"If I was Ryan Guzman & after Ian Nelson ask me, ""You want to take some cookies for the road."" I would said, ""No thank you, I just had some of your mother's cookies last night. It taste very good with Strawberry milk too.(;"""
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie is no different than Jennifer's real life that she likes little boys.
MgbBwovOOoc,Definitely watching this movie! Intriguing storyline such intensity! 
MgbBwovOOoc," #movietowatch   #theboynextdoor #greatmovies2015
cant wati to go watch this movie.."
MgbBwovOOoc,I cant wait to go watch this movie.. time for a movie date.
MgbBwovOOoc,"lol ""I can't do that............I live next door."" This looks retarded."
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie is disturbing.... Yet.. Im tempted to watch.
MgbBwovOOoc,I'll never look at a porno the same way
MgbBwovOOoc,"This looks similar to the '90s movie The Crush, with Cary Elwes and Alicia Silverstone. Cary was the teacher though, & Alicia was the teen next door. After Cary broke it off with her, she started stalking him & doing some crazy things..."
MgbBwovOOoc,"When I watch this trailer, all I can think is how this would feel a hundred times more interesting if the roles were reversed.
If the teacher was the mentally obsessed one, and she started using her authority to fuck around with his life? If he like, went to his friends and they either didn't believe him or just gave him a bunch of kudos for continuously doing something he felt wrong about? He tries to get her fired but she's got tenure and he doesn't have any proof so she can't be convicted? Holy shit would that be a fascinating delve into gender-politics, abuse of power and double standards. That movie would be awesome!
Instead, *Sigh* we have this dreck."
MgbBwovOOoc,"I mean come on this is the real of Jilo , she likes the kids and I think she still think herself the girl in twenty, this movie fits here "
MgbBwovOOoc,"I don't if any of you ever seen the movie ""Crush"" but it's basically the same shit except it's a girl obsessed with a man. Its funny how once the rolls are reversed people have shit to say... Society and their damn double standards! "
MgbBwovOOoc,"risque.. sexy with J-Lo, suspense  and more!!!"
MgbBwovOOoc,Did you see the way she was so willing to get all ''up and close'' with that ''boy next door'' looking contestant on American Idol tonight and slow dance with him? I smelled a movie promotion scheme in there! haha! But it does look like it's goin to be a good movie!
MgbBwovOOoc,"I liked this movie the first time I saw it, only it was called ""Enough."""
MgbBwovOOoc,"Something that's become all too common... The dialog in this film is all too cheesy for my liking. I was hoping maybe there was a message in this film, but, the student ends up as a stalker and violent."
MgbBwovOOoc,I think it's going to be a good movie . Can't wait to see it . 
MgbBwovOOoc,I don't see the allure in dating  or sleeping with a teenager ( is he a teenager ? ) The whole going to jail and being labeled a pedophile just doesn't seem appealing to me. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Heeeey that's the guy from Step Up Revolution! I liked him! 
MgbBwovOOoc,A MILF MOVIE HELLS YEAH
MgbBwovOOoc,I want to see this 
MgbBwovOOoc,This is before my bday my bday is January 25 and my bestie bday is January 23 
MgbBwovOOoc,So cheesy :D Why can't you live. I live next door. What?
MgbBwovOOoc,I will only see this movie if Jennifer's character dies at the end.
MgbBwovOOoc,I guess he really loves JLO's pie. I would too.
MgbBwovOOoc,its like that old movie with Mark Wahlberg..Fear I think
MgbBwovOOoc,What's the name of this song on the trailer. 
MgbBwovOOoc,anyone else notice its the Guy from STEP UP lol XD
MgbBwovOOoc,Creepy..
MgbBwovOOoc,I want to watch this movie but I'm 16 😞
MgbBwovOOoc,LOL. Oh please. Movies like this are on the Lifetime channel all the time. This is honestly nothing new.
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks really good 
MgbBwovOOoc,The trailer makes me feel like I just seen the whole movie.. Like seriously.  
MgbBwovOOoc,"This movie is devised by the American system to objectify women and increase hatred toward them.

People are mentally fucked up because they watch bullshit movies like this.

This movie is promoting pedophilism as evidently seen through the people that are commenting ""it looks hot.""

The fucking media nowadays. 

If these are the ideas that go through the minds of psychological thriller screenwriters, then they need some help. "
MgbBwovOOoc,What's the name of this song?
MgbBwovOOoc,Can't wait for this movie 🙌🙌🙌
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ok people, I'm a junior and I'm dating a freshman... what does that make me? "
MgbBwovOOoc,Looks like a pile of Barry white
MgbBwovOOoc,"Lol ""it got pretty wet here"" and ""I do love your mom's cookies"" xD "
MgbBwovOOoc, I feel this is more of a stalker issue 🔎
MgbBwovOOoc,It's time for her to move...
MgbBwovOOoc,I wonder if some people know it's just a movie cuz they takin it to seriously lol like waaay to seriously
MgbBwovOOoc,I want to see this movie 
MgbBwovOOoc,People are taking this shit too serious lol its a movie and it actually looks pretty good. Ps jlo is 45 and still hot  that's a bonus haha.
MgbBwovOOoc,Cant wait till it is on netflix
MgbBwovOOoc,J-HO
MgbBwovOOoc,that last line tho LOL
MgbBwovOOoc,"Yup, just can't sleep with a cute guy and you're married and you're a teacher and he lives next door anymore."
MgbBwovOOoc,lol i knew they film this movie at BCCHS when i saw the blue yellow colors ohh how i miss my school:| 
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies"" 👌"
MgbBwovOOoc,"The guy that had sex with Jennifer Lopez in this movie is in step up all in. The main character and step up revolution

Then Jennifer Lopez's son in the movie is from Teen Wolf, (young derrick) I love the cast already 😋"
MgbBwovOOoc,There's something hilarious about his sly remarks.  lol
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks like its going to really good
MgbBwovOOoc,Doesn't anyone else think he looks alittle like Tobias...or Four from Divergent? ☺️ or is it just me...and btw isnt JLO like...almost 50? And this kid is like....20?
MgbBwovOOoc,"Alpha as fuck!

Dylen Durret, /r/TheRedPill moderator, milf slayer"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Look up the movie ""Enough"" with Jennifer Lopez it's also a thriller and has a similar plot, seriously watch the trailer"
MgbBwovOOoc,This sounds really interesting! I am totally going to watch this!
MgbBwovOOoc,luv ur mother's cookies ;)
MgbBwovOOoc,What's the name of the background score? 
MgbBwovOOoc,"What a minute, I watched something similar to this, but it was in a porno......"
MgbBwovOOoc,damn
MgbBwovOOoc,IT'S JAKE FROM PRETTY LITTLE LIARS OHMYGOD
MgbBwovOOoc,"Wow!!!......that film looks awesome and can't wait for it to come out on DVD cos it looks like a really cool film
Everyone must watch the trailer.
"
MgbBwovOOoc,I love it I'm going to watch the movie I'm so glad wants to movie it's awesome 😍😜😝😛
MgbBwovOOoc,when did this come out?
MgbBwovOOoc,"oh, hollywood. yeah he just totally, totallyyy looks like he could have been born in 1997-2001 (high school age). lmaoooo"
MgbBwovOOoc,Ryan Guzman is so hot ugh
MgbBwovOOoc,"This looks like a great movie and I can't wait to watch it! What I can't stand is seeing all the comments about how jlo is gross and how it's so wrong how she is sleeping with a younger guy, really who cares, it's entertaining and is a movie!!!!!!!!!! And it looks like it's only jealous females saying that... I bet if you looked that good at 40 somthing like jlo is and some hott younger guy was crushin on you like he was.. I don't doubt it at all that you would do the same thing or worse!!!! Jlo looks great and younger guys like sexy older women all the time!! "
MgbBwovOOoc,"I feel like the scene where he comes over the next day or so and talks with the son, dad, and her about the weekend and cookies is gonna be creepy and funny. So many innuendos. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"Am I the only one who's laughing at ""Noah's"" sly comments? 
""I love your mother's cookies."" Or

""It got pretty wet here."" 
And J Lo is the only one catching them! XD"
MgbBwovOOoc,Lifetime is producing movies for theatres now?
MgbBwovOOoc,"It wouldve seemed more realistic if they hired someone who looked younger, he loooks wayyy too old to be in highschool "
MgbBwovOOoc,"Wow, this is pretty fuckin disturbing"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Another movie where j-lo ""portrays"" a whore…"
MgbBwovOOoc,Ryan Guzman in this just makes my day.... But I really want to watch this movie
MgbBwovOOoc,It's scary and different it kinda makes you curious. And makes you think I wanna see that! yup
MgbBwovOOoc,YES .JENNIFER GIRLL I CANT WAIT LOOKS SO GOOD  !!! 
MgbBwovOOoc,omg I can't wait. Jennifer Lopez= beautiful .
MgbBwovOOoc,Quit your job sneak out the back door with your son go stay at your mom or dads house or friends house. He won't know where you are. 
MgbBwovOOoc,this movie is unrealistic because have you seen 16 year old boys? 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Also, I don't get why people are engaging on a full on comment war. It's just a film. Basically something to kill 2 hours or so with. No need to attack each other. "
MgbBwovOOoc,Not half bad. 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Yup, there goes American morals and values down the toilet"
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mom's cookies"" haha lol. J lo's a who're for accepting this role"
MgbBwovOOoc,I seriously wanna watch. He's hot! Lol
MgbBwovOOoc,$$$$$😃😃😃😘😍😍😘🏦MCDONALD'S SAYS THANK YOU!
MgbBwovOOoc,Another enough movie from jlo?
MgbBwovOOoc,have to see this movie! looks great!
MgbBwovOOoc,"at first when I saw the trailer through a ad I didn't think it was Jennifer lopez but then it came on a ad again the I was like ""wait is that Jennifer lopez?"" lol"
MgbBwovOOoc,This was filmed in BCCHS
MgbBwovOOoc,that guy is cute but dannnnnnnnng HE CRAY
MgbBwovOOoc,Creepy 👀
MgbBwovOOoc,Would have liked It better without J.lo she is just sick a bad actress. Beautiful yes perfect cougar but c in acting in this what could have been A+ movie maybe I can just imagine someone else in her place? Yeah that's what I'm going to do.
MgbBwovOOoc,Wow ryan has come a long way from dancing movies
MgbBwovOOoc,Ughh why they had to put a milf.....i wonder if jennifer is proud of being one...aint she 52?
MgbBwovOOoc,"This movie seems really creepy, but dear God is Ryan Guzman smokin hot........... *_*"
MgbBwovOOoc,Jlo what is wrong with you! Eww.
MgbBwovOOoc,HES THE ONE FROM PRETTY LITTLE LIARS THE ONE WHO DATED ARIA! HIS NAME WAS JAKE! 
MgbBwovOOoc,I liked it better when it was called The Crush with Alicia Silverstone.  
MgbBwovOOoc,Could you imagine if this was reverse genders. It would never happen!
MgbBwovOOoc,"I am really shocked at the sexism in these comments. No one is really focusing on the stalker neighbor and how crazy he is, instead they are shaming an actress, a beautiful one at that, for play hooking up with a younger man. This really shows the overall mindset of our society, shaming women and letting men do whatever the hell they want. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"I cant believe the kind of crap they are putting out as entertainment these days. I am appalled that they would glamorize something that is so morally wrong. The beautiful act of sex, which is supposed to be a beautiful uniting of souls through love, is made cheap with affairs and one night stands. I hate how this kind of ""soft porn"" is allowed to even be played in theaters. This gave me the most awful creeps, and I feel like I would have no pleasure in watching such a disgusting and stupid plot. Well done Hollywood. You have succeeded in created yet another sex obsessed movie which will just add to the demoralizing process of society.   *Clears throat and steps off podium* "
MgbBwovOOoc,"I'm scared. This isn't even funny. I literally just saw a part of this trailer on TV and decided to check it out. That kid is horrifying. As a female growing up, I don't want to see a film of sexual abuse, when it is going on today. It just makes my heart beat a lot faster."
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks as EMBARRASSING as her Ass porn video with another Talentless Whore Z Azalea........ One Horrible Movie after the next. One Horrible song after the next..UGHHHHH.
MgbBwovOOoc,This is just like that Mark Wahlberg movie from the early 90's
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks so good I can't wait to see it!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,"I want to watch this. And for the people who feel some type of way you do know this is a movie, right"
MgbBwovOOoc,The girl next door. the guy next door. BIG difference
MgbBwovOOoc,WOHH omg Ryan is soooo hot in here!! and one lucky man.. having scenes with JLow!!
MgbBwovOOoc,"in real life the guy is 28 years old, and he looks 28 years old in the film, if they wanted to make it look realistic they would of used justin beiber. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"""It got pretty wet here""
""I love your mothers cookies""
AM I THE ONLY SOBBING AND LAUGHING ON THE FLOOR RN?"
MgbBwovOOoc,F O R S E N B O Y S
MgbBwovOOoc,Is it weird that i find him attractive?
MgbBwovOOoc,It seems intresting
MgbBwovOOoc,There are certain ladies who have no age boundary around them. And younger guys are attracted to them. It's just one of those things...
MgbBwovOOoc,Jennifer old ass always trying to act young and shit I know she has a nice body but damm this bitch just does way to much why is it always old as women acting young yet you don't see young women even acting like this lmao
MgbBwovOOoc,"the way he said ""im never letting you go "" made me melt ( :"
MgbBwovOOoc,yooo thats messed up Jennifer's 18 years older than this guy irl.
MgbBwovOOoc,Bet he's gonna die at the end
MgbBwovOOoc,so creepy!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,"People always prave on single persons, then I can't do this? !  Explosive! "
MgbBwovOOoc,I feel like I'm being stalked now....
MgbBwovOOoc,Are we going to get a 2nd trailer ??
MgbBwovOOoc,woww
MgbBwovOOoc,"I am hennifer hlopez, I like Tacos and Burritos."
MgbBwovOOoc,I'd love her cookies too ;) mmmmm yummy.lol
MgbBwovOOoc,Here's J Lo again in one of her typical slut roles SMH
MgbBwovOOoc,He is so young and she is old it is just weird
MgbBwovOOoc,Looks like a awesome movie 
MgbBwovOOoc,"When he said

No rules 
Just us  
I was like yass 


Then he said 
I got pretty wet here 
I can't do that I live next door 
I love your mothers cookies 
I couldn't stop laughing "
MgbBwovOOoc,Guys it's just a movie! He's not really underage! lol
MgbBwovOOoc,"Reasons why i would consider watching this movie
1. Her stalker is hot
2. Her son is hot"
MgbBwovOOoc,This is gross but not more disturbing than Edward fucking Bella. That's like 100 years to 18. Ew.
MgbBwovOOoc,"""it got pretty wet here"" LMFAOOO noooo that's so wrong! xD"
MgbBwovOOoc,Yandere 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Honestly I think every girl would enjoy if the ""boy"" actor was Theo James. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies"" that sounds so wrong to me on a whole nother level"
MgbBwovOOoc,The son is from teen wolf young Derek and the weirdo is in pretty little liars Aria shortime boyfriend
MgbBwovOOoc,1:18  Best part lol
MgbBwovOOoc,i hope it turns out to be a good movie!
MgbBwovOOoc,All yall niggas bitchin about jlo in this  movie and shit  i don't  give  a fuck she is 45 and way better looking than most of you ugly fucking females ha and that guy in the  movie is just happy about touching jlo shit I'd  be happy too

MgbBwovOOoc,Something's wrong with my eyes cuz I thought the dude was James Franco 
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh my Gosh! I wanna watch
MgbBwovOOoc,Ooh I'm gonna love this!
MgbBwovOOoc,"Shit who wouldn't be obsessed with J lo lol but this movie kinda reminds me of her old movie, enough don't u think"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Some ""Orphan"" crap?"
MgbBwovOOoc,OMG I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks like a Lifetime type of movie.
MgbBwovOOoc,"I thought this movie would be stupid, but now that I've watched the trailer, I NEED TO SEE IT!!!!!"
MgbBwovOOoc,"This dude looks like a senior in college, not high school. And i've basically seen the whole movie by this trailer. Either way, I can't wait to see it in theatres!"

Hahahhaa! All the girls I have shown this too are going crazy for it. "
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,"I love your mother's cookies. Eat up, boy."
MgbBwovOOoc,"Can some of you people stop freaking out?! They're acting, shit like this does go on in real life. Some people love older women and men. Some love younger women and men. If both are adults and have that connection then leave it the fuck alone. If it involves a loved one then I understand there might be a possible disagreement but damn be fucking civil for once "
MgbBwovOOoc,don't mess with those young boys lol
MgbBwovOOoc,"Musica cristiana
"
MgbBwovOOoc,I cant wait to watch it . I like jlo the thriller :)
MgbBwovOOoc,Seems like a wattpad fanfic finally being made movie 💀
MgbBwovOOoc,dayummm... 
MgbBwovOOoc,He's hot OMG  I want to see this 😍
MgbBwovOOoc,guys it just a movie. But i agree this shit is scary.
MgbBwovOOoc,this sounds and looks like a fanfic with like punk one direction except j lo is older than those girls in the fanfic 
MgbBwovOOoc,i imagined myself being in her place and I would be scared af! But then again the dude is kinda hot so......ehhh
MgbBwovOOoc,"""Love your mother's cookies."" I laugh everytime.. "
MgbBwovOOoc,Is it just me or should this have been a Lifetime movie? I swear I've seen a Lifetime movie with the same plot! The boy was obessed with his teacher I think Elizabeth Berkley was in it! The name of the movie is Student Seduction it came out in 2003!
MgbBwovOOoc,ALEX CLARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <33333333333333333333333333333333
MgbBwovOOoc,"This movie looks so good
"
MgbBwovOOoc,Lmao this was so bad i was cringing the whole time :/
MgbBwovOOoc,"So...like... a woman dating an older man sounds a little fine, and people are accustomed to hearing about it..

But it's way creepier, and it sounds more repulsive > that an older woman dates a younger guy 

Culture sets us all

"
MgbBwovOOoc,They were doing what!
MgbBwovOOoc,First
MgbBwovOOoc,Blah :/ Are they really making this?!Seems like a low budget lifetime movie. They keep making repeats of stalker movie's & it's just not entertaining anymore.
MgbBwovOOoc,looks like it might be an ok movie.....but....the boy next door is one lucky mofo to get it in with jlo lol
MgbBwovOOoc,See what good pussy can do to you smh 
MgbBwovOOoc,Cant wait to see this
MgbBwovOOoc,For people calling Jennifer a pedophile: I guess you don't know what acting is. As for me: I'm excited to see the movie. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh gosh Ryan Guzman is so ugh hot. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Lol it's acting guys! Holy shit! You guys are acting like this role defines J-lo.. She's not a pedophile 
MgbBwovOOoc,"I feel like you guys are forgetting that a) this is a movie, B) these are actors, C) this is about his obsession with her, and D) she feels guilty about their affair and wants nothing more to do with him, for the safety of herself and her family"
MgbBwovOOoc,"WHAT?!? How is this ok?! The double standard that this movie is perpetuating is gross. Apparently it's sexy and romantic for a teacher to take advantage of a student. If this movie was made about a male teacher and a female student it wouldn't be seen as sexy and ""a forbidden passion"" it would be call what it is: Pedophilia  "
MgbBwovOOoc,BOY♂NEXT♂DOOR
MgbBwovOOoc,I love movies with Jennifer Lopez. She should stop singing and stick to acting tbh
MgbBwovOOoc,I can't believe that's the guy that played Sean in Step Up 4 & 5.
MgbBwovOOoc,It a freaking movie!!!! It's not for real 😑 THEY are acting 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ok I thought this was gona be a cute ass movie in the beginning of the trailer but then when I kept watching it I started getting disturbed & stuff so yeah not interested in watching it anymore. 
Well maybe but only because the guy & J-Lo are hot af. But yeah I'm uncomfortable now. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"I cannot wait to see this! Sexy, Suspenseful, Made me want more!"
MgbBwovOOoc,"OK so the woman screwed with the Boy's emotions and everyone dies because of it... Stupid lady shouldn't have done that especially in a ""this could be love scenario"""
MgbBwovOOoc,First movie ever where I've seen Jennifer Lopez with her hair down. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Gotta see this!!! its like Obessed and the StepDad in one for me.
MgbBwovOOoc,Can't Ryan Guzman is playing the boy next door
MgbBwovOOoc,Pussy was that good damn
MgbBwovOOoc,"It's a damn movie, they act but to all you people who saying it's pathetic,  think of that dude being you. Would you turn down fucking jlo I mean let's get real lol. "
MgbBwovOOoc,This creeps me out so much yet I still want to watch it....
MgbBwovOOoc,I love Ian Nelson !!!
MgbBwovOOoc,hey its mini Derick 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Its another ""addicted"" and ""temptation"" lol ima watch but damn same story "
MgbBwovOOoc,He's twenty fucking seven.  at least hire someone younger to play a teenager.
MgbBwovOOoc,Wow I want to see this movie
MgbBwovOOoc,"People are making comments on a old woman and a young boy, but it's the other way around all the time in film. Gotta love these double standards"
MgbBwovOOoc,NOAH CAN STALK ME ANYTIME LOL
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks good! Fourteen or not I am so seeing this!
MgbBwovOOoc,Why do people make movies like this
MgbBwovOOoc,Whoever decides to hire J-ho as an actress is an idiot

MgbBwovOOoc,It's too perfect.
MgbBwovOOoc,Wow the boy next door is going to be a trip =-O 
MgbBwovOOoc,They finally took the approach to make it as the women is the one to have fucked up and created a messed up relationship with someone else that is a man .....that's my boy did that but put comedy this is just raw.....
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie looks so good! I must see it!
MgbBwovOOoc,this looks good
MgbBwovOOoc,I want to see this.
MgbBwovOOoc,I'm kind of tempted to watch this..looks pretty good 😗😉
MgbBwovOOoc,"There are young teachers, that can have barely an age differences to students. So judging this without actual full acknowledge is stupid. Some of you guys odviously do not know a obsession as well."
MgbBwovOOoc,I need to watch this !!
MgbBwovOOoc,Just move. Period.
MgbBwovOOoc,It's been done too many times. And the trailer looks cliched 
MgbBwovOOoc,This reminds me of a story that I read on wattpad xD 
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks sooo awkward and I really wanna see. It looks like it's going to be full of twists like Gone Girl was. Gone Girl was amazing.
MgbBwovOOoc,Just like obssessed ( with beyoncè ) but a little different but basically the same concept
MgbBwovOOoc,Quit this ad in my screen god !
MgbBwovOOoc,Born bad much 
MgbBwovOOoc,Now I want a CUTE guy to be obesssed over me 😔
MgbBwovOOoc,I hate movies that have people who are 29 play 16yr olds.....especially now days 16yr olds look 14
MgbBwovOOoc,This is a porn movie right?
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,What's the song?
MgbBwovOOoc,Can't wait 
MgbBwovOOoc,Jlo pussy to good got the guy blowing shit up 😂😂😎
MgbBwovOOoc,Is it weird that i don't find this trailer creepy at all but instead find it really interesting??
MgbBwovOOoc,"Good movie. Interesting,hooking onto to me but still disturbing. "
MgbBwovOOoc,Reminds me of that movie Fear 
MgbBwovOOoc,OH MY GOD ITS JENNIFERR💅
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh gosh.
MgbBwovOOoc,J-HO
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh my. Scandalous!
MgbBwovOOoc,Talk about being overly horny for a woman. lol....
MgbBwovOOoc,Omgggg I cannot wait for this. Wooow he's crazy wooooow  I just can't wait. This is so good and he is so hott
MgbBwovOOoc,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,which song are we hearing in trailer..?
MgbBwovOOoc,WTF EWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,I'd just watch it to see the sex scene then turn the movie off 
MgbBwovOOoc,my ex-boyfriend stalked me for years until i got a Restraining Order against him its scary but he's locked up now so I've moved on got a family :)
MgbBwovOOoc,Is he even a grown man or teen like Jennifer or grown woman
MgbBwovOOoc,And yet another way in which we can pathologize the male gender. Forget all the female teachers taking advantage of the vulnerability of their male students or coercing them into sex. No! Those boys wanted it! Those poor female teachers are the ones being taken advantage of! This society is seriously disgusting... what... the... fuck... is wrong with everybody.
MgbBwovOOoc,The dudes hot as fuck though. I'll wait in line 
MgbBwovOOoc,"He's so hot for a teenager! I really want to see this movie because of the 3 lines he said, ""it got pretty wet over here"", ""I'm never letting you go"" and ""i love your mother's cookie"" got me excited! 😝"
MgbBwovOOoc,"OOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I REALLY WANT TO SEE IT!!!!!!
"
MgbBwovOOoc,I GOTTA see this
MgbBwovOOoc,What is it rated R ? 
MgbBwovOOoc,Oool
MgbBwovOOoc,YOUNG DEREK 
MgbBwovOOoc,Omg I gotta see this movie 😱😱😱🙌🙌🙌
MgbBwovOOoc,"There is something so nasty about an older woman messing around with a younger man, or boy. Women like that are very pathetic, and should be ashamed of themselves. UGH!"
MgbBwovOOoc,Does he have to be so attractive? 
MgbBwovOOoc,A pedophile movie? What???
MgbBwovOOoc,"So....basically, another version of 'Enough'?"
MgbBwovOOoc,oh my god that's jake from pretty little liars 
MgbBwovOOoc,"This is... scary. Not in a good way at all. Like, not in a ""that's scary and I will gladly watch it again to get a good spook"" way. I don't know, this just hits me the wrong way. It just disturbs me... Makes me feel really uncomfortable, y'know?"
MgbBwovOOoc,Yeah but j-lo kind of choose Risky role being a pervert in all
MgbBwovOOoc,This seems soooo good and funny because he is so obsessed but he's hot so it's a good thing?
MgbBwovOOoc,lol i just wanna see this movie because of Ian Nelson 😍😍😍
MgbBwovOOoc,"On my list for movies to see, looks like this is going to be good!"
MgbBwovOOoc,Gawd J.Lo is just perfection. 
MgbBwovOOoc,he's actually so attractive i sat here and got mad 
MgbBwovOOoc,whats the song that plays near the end?
MgbBwovOOoc,How many more movies like this are they going to make? 
MgbBwovOOoc,"My god,I cannot wait for this movie😂"
MgbBwovOOoc,"It got pretty ""wet"" over here. Maybe I'm immature, but I want to see this movie BECAUSE of that line."
MgbBwovOOoc,"I came across this through the YouTube advertisements, and from the beginning, that ominous music made me go, ""hmmmm. This can't just be another rom com."" Anyone with me here?
It's amazing how sound can change the entire mood of things."
MgbBwovOOoc,Everyone is complaining about how he doesn't look like a high schooler and that's he too old but lets say they did get someone younger that would be even weirder and y'all would complain that he's too younger and that Jennifer is a pedophile so just leave it the movie looks good as it is
MgbBwovOOoc,i cant wait to see this 😩
MgbBwovOOoc,omfg phsyco xD
MgbBwovOOoc,I seen a lifetime movie with a very similar plot. Hmm..
MgbBwovOOoc,He's really hot but honestly he doesn't pass for 16 in the slightest...
MgbBwovOOoc,"What's the song name at 2:00? I heard that same song once in True Detective, I recognised it, and that's the only reason why I'm here."
MgbBwovOOoc,lol at the last joke tho
MgbBwovOOoc,"At first I thought this movie was going to be just another romance movie, but no it went to the extremes! Holy crap! I kind of liked the guy in a shorter trailer but.....lordd.....not now!"
MgbBwovOOoc,Omg I have to watch this
MgbBwovOOoc,"Usually I don't like movies like this, but I will be in the theaters when this comes out."
MgbBwovOOoc,didnt this happen to her in real life?
MgbBwovOOoc,"The guy really looks like a young Theo James, it's freaky..."
MgbBwovOOoc,I will watch this movie even if it is the last thing I ever do. IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,Me likes this :)
MgbBwovOOoc,Omg that's so amazing 
MgbBwovOOoc,i will be lining up for the cookies :3 
MgbBwovOOoc,RYAN GUZMAN!!!!😍😍😍😘😘😘❤❤❤
MgbBwovOOoc,Basically what would've happened if edward from twilight was real
MgbBwovOOoc,Ehh.. why J-Lo
MgbBwovOOoc,This makes me uncomfortable...
MgbBwovOOoc,"Wow this looks amazing......If you think women are always the victim on the premise that they are all incapable of decision making, dealing with consequences and are always uncontrollably seduced by overconfident jock high school boys. I mean of course her successful husband who she had no say in marrying is plowing ""His Secretary"" so original -His secretary, His wife, His obsession with His wife guess its always gonna be His fault. This shit is dehumanizing to men women and everyone with a brain that is capable of true love   "
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks amazing. 
MgbBwovOOoc,I luv movies like this yessss the her son is young derek from teen wolf
MgbBwovOOoc,Another shitty movie added to the film industry
MgbBwovOOoc,It's gonna be AMAZING!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,Hollywood needs to do more films with this theme. xD
MgbBwovOOoc,Seems like a Lifetime movie...
MgbBwovOOoc,So a girl next door is a pornstar and a guy next door is a psychopath. Haa
MgbBwovOOoc,looks pretty similar to the hindi movie Tum ... then again ... there must be  a 1000 movies with the exact same storyline!
MgbBwovOOoc,Lmao it got pretty wet in here
MgbBwovOOoc,The girl next door was far better. 
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks amazing I can't wait it looks like Enough tho. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Yeah young derek woohoo
MgbBwovOOoc,4REALZ...I really dont like this trailer movie THE BOY NEXT DOOR.
MgbBwovOOoc,Watching it for first time from a YouTube ad I seriously thought it was a parody guy version of girl next door 😂
MgbBwovOOoc,THATS TEEN DEREK HALE
MgbBwovOOoc,This guy is seriously hot! All I can say is hotttttt
MgbBwovOOoc,"this movie looks good, but the trailer just gave away too much ! :("
MgbBwovOOoc,"Can't imagine there's much more to the movie than what was shown right here in the trailer. Outside of that I can imagine some cringe worthy dialogue/scenes, boring fill-in  parts, the silly stalk part that'll make up a good portion of the movie, and then a predictable ending. "
MgbBwovOOoc,This is such a Lifetime flick
MgbBwovOOoc,I Can't wait to see this movie by Jennifer Lopez
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie looks good. A must see 👍
MgbBwovOOoc,50 shades of grey
MgbBwovOOoc,Wtf why am I just now hearing about this movie.. I want to see it
MgbBwovOOoc,Hurry January 23rd !
MgbBwovOOoc,"Really stupid. If a man had been in place of Jennifer and it was an underage girl, this movie would be considered inappropriate. But apparently this is totally fine...?"
MgbBwovOOoc,That is one old ass junior. Damn.!
MgbBwovOOoc,Another awfully acted jlo flick.
MgbBwovOOoc,I seriously can't wait
MgbBwovOOoc,omg... i'm same age as JL n my son just turn 17!! this makes me feel soooo akward O.O
MgbBwovOOoc,"Reminds me of ""enough"""
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh please if it was a older single dad and a younger girl it would have been a love story but since it's a older single mom and younger guy of course it HAS TO go wrong
MgbBwovOOoc,i need to see this!!
MgbBwovOOoc,i cant wait to watch this 
MgbBwovOOoc,The Truth is right next door...wil you open the door ? Google truth contest and read *The Present* if you think you're ready.....Or maybe you're not ?
MgbBwovOOoc,"anybody know the song? by the way, awesome movie, can't wait to see it!!!"
MgbBwovOOoc,SUPER RYAN!!!!! I'M SO EXCITED FOR SEE THIS MOVIE!
MgbBwovOOoc,"Noah: ""I love your mothers cookies.""
Claire: *silence*

Me: ""Awwwwwwwh daaaaamn! Hush mode!"""
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies.."" hahahaha"
MgbBwovOOoc,good
MgbBwovOOoc,good
MgbBwovOOoc,good
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie looks so intense and creepy! 
MgbBwovOOoc, Yes for the Alex Clare!!! 
MgbBwovOOoc,"@Universal Pictures  Since both the lead actors are great dancers can you have an 'item number' in the movie, like we have here in our Indian/Bollywood movies?"
MgbBwovOOoc,This movie seems like it is going to be great i really want to watch it
MgbBwovOOoc,My boy is so disrespectful.. In front of her man.. And it looks Bomb!! #Comesoutinmybdaymonth 👌👌👌 Yasss.. So many good movies coming out.  Beyond the lights was bomb too.. 👌👌 
MgbBwovOOoc,Y'all just saw jlo in her underwear and that made you want to see this movie hahahaha
MgbBwovOOoc,Ryan is YANDERE in this movie. Only Otakus would know<3
MgbBwovOOoc,he sooo fine he could hack my account he can use my netflix account he can hack my facebook he can even have the password to my phone i wouldnt mind 😩😩
MgbBwovOOoc,"Lmao "" i love your mothers cookies ""😂😂"
MgbBwovOOoc,I love you mothers cookies haha :)
MgbBwovOOoc,what's the name of the song? please :B 
MgbBwovOOoc,The film will end with J-Lo being panned by the critics yet again and the film flopping. This looks straight to dvd level. So cliched it astonishes me people would pay to see it.
MgbBwovOOoc,1:56 music???
MgbBwovOOoc,This is kind of sick. This movie would have never even been made if it were an adult man and a young girl.
MgbBwovOOoc,Why? after dancing in los angeles. Sean become like this.
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh yes! Go J.Lo! I can't wait to see this!
MgbBwovOOoc,did she produce this or something this is Enough again it would be Enough 2
MgbBwovOOoc,"What a dirty boy. ""It got pretty wet here too"" ""I like your mom's cookies"" wtf 😂😂"
MgbBwovOOoc,"We've seen this storyline all over lifetime and other stupid channels.
Why does this bitch get her own world wide movie with a storyline thats overrated?
She should have done lifetime, thats how poor her acting really is!
SorryNotsorry but i dont like her. Only movies i enjoyed were maid in manhattan and Selena. "
MgbBwovOOoc,He's Sean! From step up all in he's cute.
MgbBwovOOoc,"He is sooooo hot 
she is lucky :/"
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,This trailer is such a spoil.
MgbBwovOOoc,They expect us to believe this guy is in high school? And we know's J-Lo's pussy can't keep a man in real life so this is a change. lol
MgbBwovOOoc,i dont like how she's portrayed as the victim here. she's the adult and she should know better. also i think if she the teenager was a girl and the teacher a male. the roles would be completely revised; just shitty double standards 
MgbBwovOOoc,I love your moms cookies
MgbBwovOOoc,I need this song.... 
MgbBwovOOoc,when she touched his abs!! 
MgbBwovOOoc,i hope it has a happy ending and they ended up with each other
MgbBwovOOoc,"Yummy Ryan Guzman...Shuddup, you all were thinking it ;)"
MgbBwovOOoc,omgggg i ca't wait for this movieeeeee!!
MgbBwovOOoc,SHUT UP WITH ALL THE RAPE AND ILLEGAL RELATIONSHIP CRAP LIKE IF YOU DONT WANNA WATCH THE GODDAMN MOVIE THEN DON'T! STOP REPEATING WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID A MILLION TIMES! jeeez...
MgbBwovOOoc,"Imagine the shit storm SJW's and feminists would create if this was ""The Girl Next Door.""  And it was a grown man committing statutory rape on a young girl. They would be out protesting it in force.  Who wants to bet you'll see no reaction whatsoever, even though they are, of course all about equality.  Not to add it looks like garbage and the entire plot is given away in the trailer.  I can't believe someone actually said ""I Will be lining up when this""  Don't worry, there will be no line."
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies"" I'M SCREAMING "
MgbBwovOOoc,Lol damn he to cute so yall will see me in the movie
MgbBwovOOoc,Wait.. is that kid the teen version of Derek in teen wolf?? 
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother cookies"" xD hahahaha"
MgbBwovOOoc,What a bunch of crap.  
MgbBwovOOoc,wow interesting...the trailer made it seem like one kind of movie at the start but then drastically changed...i love the music also
MgbBwovOOoc,That was so HOT!! I can't wait till January!!! #EroticThrillers 
MgbBwovOOoc,OMG 
MgbBwovOOoc,The movie's title should be like 'My neighbor's hot wife' :D Damn! This enters my porn category! i'm so gonna watch this :D
MgbBwovOOoc,Tell you what I would love to be that boy next door lol
MgbBwovOOoc,Moral of the story: do NOT trust hot people!
MgbBwovOOoc,Whoa! This should be interesting!
MgbBwovOOoc,That booty can make a man go crazy xD
MgbBwovOOoc,Looks like a Lifetime movie. 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Ese Hombre, Que Bueno Esta :$ Guapo,Atractivo & Sexy!"
MgbBwovOOoc,Looks like the best movie ever 
MgbBwovOOoc,"wow, yo nunca voy al cine pero está pelicula está genial! maravillosa como siempre!"
MgbBwovOOoc,she seems a bit old for him and who told her that she could act. 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Already loved this movie!!!
CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!"
MgbBwovOOoc,But her breasts aren't that big though
MgbBwovOOoc,maybe this will raise more awareness in the psychology area of USA's health  #alwaysfindthebrightside    #jlofollowsback  
MgbBwovOOoc,are you kiding me?? the guy noah doesn't look like teenager....JLO AND NOAH BOTH LOOK SAME AGE...C'MON IF TEHY WANTED SOME TEENAGER..they should have taken someone fir for the role
MgbBwovOOoc,45 aged whore loved for her ass.
MgbBwovOOoc,Zamn 😩 i wish i was her i woulda just went with the flow 😂😩😍😌💕
MgbBwovOOoc,The Boy Next Door - Official Trailer
MgbBwovOOoc,song ?
MgbBwovOOoc,Cant wait!!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,omg that was like the hottest....... second........third hottest thing I have ever seen
MgbBwovOOoc,"LAME. How many times do we have to keep watching this same, predictable crap over and over again? ""Fatal Attraction"" doesn't need to be rehashed again and again. "
MgbBwovOOoc,Hope older women will get a better understanding to not mess with teenage boys as it is not okay the other way around.
MgbBwovOOoc,J.LO ♥
MgbBwovOOoc,look im only 11 so i cant see (sucks!!!) but when it said i love your mothers cookies i couldnt help but smile.
MgbBwovOOoc,Is that one of the maids on devious maids
MgbBwovOOoc,keeen as a bean
MgbBwovOOoc,Jennifer Lopez. Is. Stalking material. I would understand this guy plight. I mean... it's Jennifer Lopez.
MgbBwovOOoc,"    Yes! Just when I can't get enough of watching 'Enough,' My girl J-LO comes out with another thriller!  I can't wait until this hit theaters.  Though I've stop going to the movies, due to so much craziness, I'm going to make an exception for this movie.  "
MgbBwovOOoc,"This looks crazy good. Suspenseful but poor Aiden from Sex and the City. Always being cheated on lol. Anyways, I think the high school boy looks legit. I mean high school boys these days do look older than what they are."
MgbBwovOOoc,What's up with JLO acting in these movies where someone is stalking her?  Wasn't ENOUGH enough? #imjustsaying
MgbBwovOOoc,1.57 - anyone know the title of the song that starts at that time??
MgbBwovOOoc,rip off the girl next door only with boy changed?? hollywood running out of ideas
MgbBwovOOoc,Baby Derek!!!! Main reason I will be watching it will be for the actor playing Kevin was teenage Derek in Teen Wolf.
MgbBwovOOoc,I'm watching a Lifetime movie right now called The Boy Next Door.  Seems like this JLo movie is different and even though its probably predictable I will still go and see this when it comes out.
MgbBwovOOoc,"Dam i know everyone is entitled to an opinion, but why is it always the haters that talk 💩, keep your negative reviews to yourself LOL jlo is a beautiful multitalented woman who looks dam good for her age 👍👌 besides people forget personal life has nothing to do with Movie stars entertaining us 😝 we're all human no one is perfect!!!!! "
MgbBwovOOoc,The twist: Iggy Azalea will jump in at the end and say ITS IGGY IGGZ oWWW 
MgbBwovOOoc,Holy shit
MgbBwovOOoc,The guy was actually kinda nice at the start but at the end was a fucking jerk
MgbBwovOOoc,"1:18 ""it got pretty wet here.""  seriously?  lol."
MgbBwovOOoc,omg omg omg this movie looks crazyyyyyyyyyyy
MgbBwovOOoc,i kinda died at 1:18 was it just me? lol
MgbBwovOOoc,"Fsee , ""It Got Pretty Wet Here"" . You Know What That Really Meant . "
MgbBwovOOoc,Deep dark fantasy
MgbBwovOOoc,This trailer has great music.
MgbBwovOOoc,Supid as hell
MgbBwovOOoc,JLo doesnt suit this movie.
MgbBwovOOoc,would this movie be hotter is J Lo were replaced by Salma  Hayek or Constance Marie?
MgbBwovOOoc,Omgosh why is he so hot?! The lord is testing me...  #mybodyisready   #ryanguzman  
MgbBwovOOoc,"Why does her song ""First Love"" always make me remember this trailer? This thing is like the farthest from a love song about a pure love LOL I'll watch this. Seems good."
MgbBwovOOoc,So we're supposed to feel sorry for a pedo?  
MgbBwovOOoc,"Wait, so we're supposed to feel sympathy for the rapist character?"
MgbBwovOOoc,"So, she cheats on her husband and its with a student, yet the film is making the student the bad guy. "
MgbBwovOOoc,Could you imagine the hate this would get if the sexes were reversed?
MgbBwovOOoc,wanna see this
MgbBwovOOoc,This is why I wanna be an actor O.O J-Lo please....
MgbBwovOOoc,"In her head he's the boy next door. In his head, she's the booty next door. lol"
MgbBwovOOoc,The Guy Who Played Young Derek From Teen Wolf Is In This Movie💕💕
MgbBwovOOoc,"""It got pretty wet here"" OOOOOOHHHH BABY A TRIPLE"
MgbBwovOOoc,whats the music?
MgbBwovOOoc,"I see that a lot of people are saying "" I can't wait to watch this movie because I love J-LO!"" Where as I'm like "" I can't wait to watch this movie because I love Ian!"""
MgbBwovOOoc,"LOL@Unknown86 hahahahahahahahahahaha. Hey don't be dissing Jennifer Lopez. I'm glad she has a sex scene in this movie because it's been awhile since I've seen her half naked. Wow@her body at 0:55 mark. I sure would like to kiss her body. The young guy she had sex with at the end of the previews, he said I like your mom's cookies hahahahahahahahahahaha. The young guy sure is crazy for stalking her. I wonder why he wouldn't leave her alone when she told him that she didn't want a relationship. I wanna see this and I'm mad that it doesn't come out until January because I saw the previews today when I saw No Good Deed with Idris Elba and Taraji Henson. I thought it might come out next month or November."
MgbBwovOOoc,Literally just here for Ian Nelson😍❤️😘
MgbBwovOOoc,i love Ian Nelson<3<3
MgbBwovOOoc,"First off, J-Lo is like the hottest woman on the planet! Fuck me. Secondly, if this ""boy"" grew his hair out a little bit, he'd look younger. He looks 25ish to me, but this is Hollyweird for you. Today's heartthrobs are ass ugly (Efron, Gosling, Tatum, etc.) compared to prime Johhny Depp and Brad Pitt. Maybe they should do more nationwide searches or something."
MgbBwovOOoc,So many puns! I'm gonna love it
MgbBwovOOoc,"Boy oh boy. You guys making these comments are kinda mean spirited up in here.  I'm not sure I want to get my head chewed off if I say the wrong thing, or anything. I like Jennifer Lopez, I don't have a problem with her. I haven't seen this film yet. What's the big deal. Is the guy having sex with her after her son too? It's just too weird. "
MgbBwovOOoc,anyone know the name of the song..?
MgbBwovOOoc,"Jennifer Lopez is always the best in roles where she has to kick a guys ass. She's giving me the movie ""Enough"" flash backs. I'm excited for this one."
MgbBwovOOoc,oh J.Lo. You so OUT OF SIGHT. :D
MgbBwovOOoc,"YASSS JEN!! It's about time! I've missed her in movies. Lol it's so interesting that the haters keep checking up on Jen. Closet JLo fans, COME OUT & show yourselves.  #TeamJLo  "
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies"" AAAHAHAHAHA"
MgbBwovOOoc,Years past she is still fine😍
MgbBwovOOoc,"First of all they showed us the whole movie in this trailer, and that would all be fine, if they didn't cast this man who looks like he is 30 years old, to play the boy next door"
MgbBwovOOoc,What is the name of the song? Or is it not out yet? 
MgbBwovOOoc,It's the first Yandere movie--
MgbBwovOOoc,the movie looks awesome
MgbBwovOOoc,32196L
MgbBwovOOoc,"""Noah"" looked like Edward from Twilight for a second in a scene "
MgbBwovOOoc,so who's gonna watch this because of Ian Nelson? who's with me? :)
MgbBwovOOoc,Happy birthday Ryan! 
MgbBwovOOoc,Jake from PLL 0-0
MgbBwovOOoc,It's a fucking movie shut up damn. Acting like this is real life😑
MgbBwovOOoc,So... Obsessed? Except with a student-teacher instead of secretary-boss?
MgbBwovOOoc,Temptation....
MgbBwovOOoc,"I wanted to see this movie at first,  but after seeing the whole stalker, psychopath part, I was like: um.....nevermind. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"Lord Jesus if he was to put hands on me it would be ""raining"" pretty ""hard"" over here to. *wink* *wink*"
MgbBwovOOoc,Hahaha this movies funny. Smh silly sex puns.
MgbBwovOOoc,"What the fuk is wrong with people and goddamn movies these days, I was able to predict exactly what the plot of this movie would be, and I can even tell you what will happen in it when the piece of shit comes out. There is absolutely zero fuking originality in movies now, they take a plot from an old movie and upgrade the graphics and make it more modern (aka fucking stupid), then change the name to the fuking spoiler or plot of the movie. How and when the fuk did this become okay, and why the fuk are people still paying, PAYING, to rewatch something they've already seen with different characters. Lmfaaooo america. Open your fuking eyes."
MgbBwovOOoc,It's quipped my interest
MgbBwovOOoc,"Looks like a boy next door version of enough, it looked good until the end where he says the by next door line "
MgbBwovOOoc,Milf
MgbBwovOOoc,Does anyone know the song that's being played? 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Wait, so is Noah an antagonist or not?"
MgbBwovOOoc,oh my gawd
MgbBwovOOoc,Lol this looks so horrible that I'd rather watch a Madea movie.
MgbBwovOOoc,I don't know whether I should be turned on or creeped out after watching this... But Ryan Guzman though... oh my... He's super hoooooot!  #mybodyisready  
MgbBwovOOoc,I love Ryan Guzman but damn he crazy in this movie...def gonna watch it tho 
MgbBwovOOoc,If this was the other way around it wouldn't be a movie. The male teacher would be a sex offender and labeled a pedophile. Nice double standard guys.﻿
MgbBwovOOoc,"Whats the name of the song?
"
MgbBwovOOoc,1:16 lol
MgbBwovOOoc,What's the name of this song that's playing through this trailer by the way?
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mothers cookies"" Lmao XD"
MgbBwovOOoc,Great I'm waiting  this film .. JLO hot
MgbBwovOOoc,"Oh cool, we don't even have to pay to watch the movie now. Thanks Universal! I'd guess, in an attempt to be ""original"", the studio opts for a ""surprise twist"" in which the villain gets away with it xD. "
MgbBwovOOoc,They show the entire damn movie in the trailer!
MgbBwovOOoc,What's the songs name
MgbBwovOOoc,*idk if its me but I find cougars disgusting but with jlo is different because she kidov looks his age to me she looks like she's 30 so I don't find it that bad*
MgbBwovOOoc,*isn't he from step up revolution???????*
MgbBwovOOoc,She's always in these types of situations huh?
MgbBwovOOoc,OMG did he seriously say I love your moms cookies!!!!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,I LOVE IT! GOING TO SEE!
MgbBwovOOoc,I definitely want to see this!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,can't wait to watch and the guy is soo hot. He could taste my 🍪😃
MgbBwovOOoc,One word.....predictable. 😐
MgbBwovOOoc,"What if u can make money in see in video as u see this and get pay like I'm doing right now? That would be awesome righ? And what if u don't how to do it but even your grandmother can teach u how.. And what if even if u won't  to try it but for some how u don't wont to get rich, I give u everything back with nothing to lose.

"
MgbBwovOOoc,I always loved her acting. She definitely has to be on more movies
MgbBwovOOoc,No Good Deed bought me here! Jennifer Lopez is amazing in these kinds of movies! 
MgbBwovOOoc,"""you're not from around here.."""
MgbBwovOOoc,"I'm going to see this! Reminds me of Beyonce when she did her movie ""Obsessed""."
MgbBwovOOoc,"The first JLo movie I'm interested in seeing in forever. Not expecting cinematic gold, but it looks like a decent thriller! "
MgbBwovOOoc,Wanna take a cookie for the road...I love your mothers cookies...lol
MgbBwovOOoc,"i seriously cannot wait for this movie. it makes me so happy to see jen getting these big roles and making people understand she's such an amazing actress. as a triple threat, most people only focus on one of her talents. but she's such a professional and so amazing at every single thing she puts her hands on. this movie is already slaying me tbh, it just shows how many sides of jen the actress you can see. it's not the typical rom-com, the happy ever ending type of movie, and she'll show y'all that's totally fine, because great actresses just make everything work. and if you're calling jennifer a ""hoe"" for having a sex scene in a movie (it's called acting btw in case you didn't know) then i guess all actresses are considered hoes huh? anyway, grow up a lil cmon. stop looking at the worst side of things, or trying to find them and just start focusing on the best ones. this movie is perfect already and if you don't like it just don't watch it. as simple as that:) "
MgbBwovOOoc,"a pedophile protagonist, as long as they are female it's ok"
MgbBwovOOoc,that Hot guy from Step UP! 
MgbBwovOOoc,can we talk about the boy who plays noah cause damn..
MgbBwovOOoc,can we talk about the boy who plays noah cause damn..
MgbBwovOOoc,_I love your mom's cookies._
MgbBwovOOoc,"Male version of Alex Forrest in Fatal Attraction. this movie reminds me helluva of Fatal Attraction!! I rather rent it. Sorry, JLo."
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks good to me.  Jlo has never looked better.
MgbBwovOOoc,The movie reminds me of Enough and other similar movies with obsessed guys/girls. I'll watch it because of Jennifer.
MgbBwovOOoc,Maybe Noah is a super senior?  I don't think jlo will have sex with a minor 16-17 years old lol 
MgbBwovOOoc,basically the whole plot was revealed in this 
MgbBwovOOoc,"I love your mothers cookies,, LMAO
"
MgbBwovOOoc,wuhoooo J-Lo again's......I want see this movie
MgbBwovOOoc,THIS IS SO WEIRD BUT LOOKS SO  GOOD
MgbBwovOOoc,what song is at the end ish part?
MgbBwovOOoc,I would love to see Jlo with black hair again like when she played Selena and maid in manathan .. I think it suited better. Anyway  what a tease I thought the movie was soon to be in theaters lol we have to wait til January 
MgbBwovOOoc,Hhhb
MgbBwovOOoc,"""Well, it got pretty wet here."" LOLOL!"
MgbBwovOOoc,damn! need to see
MgbBwovOOoc,"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!!!!!

Jesus Christ.  There has been a HUGE Epidemic of Female teachers having sex with their students male and female.  But you don't know about it because the Media does not make a big deal about it.  

Even though in the back of your head you are saying,  Lucky guys. Or man there was one teacher I wished had sex with me.  

It's still rape!  Even though female Sexual predators like this serve FAR less sentencing than males who commit the same crimes.  

This movie, and we all know J-Lo is a man hating feminist.  Makes those female teacher sexual predators look like VICTIMS.  Once again feminism is playing the victim card. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"This reminds me of her movie ""Enough"" Love that movie."
MgbBwovOOoc,"Anyone else think that ""Noah"" or Ryan Guzman should've been casted as Christian Grey for Fifty Shades of Grey? "
MgbBwovOOoc,Well THAT took an unexpected turn...
MgbBwovOOoc,i cant wait for it!
MgbBwovOOoc,The Boy Next Door = Fifty Shades of Grey + Obsessed 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Everyone's all like ""JLO YES!"" or ""JLO EWW!"" And I'm here wondering what the music in the beginning was."
MgbBwovOOoc,"Noah is 27yrs old in real life and he looks it. Wow I mean I know they can't get a real 17 year old boy to play the part but they can find someone who looks younger... Also this movie has been done a few times over, and did anyone else laugh out loud, cause I did....Oh Lopez you keep on trying to act."
MgbBwovOOoc,I feel like i've seen the whole movie!
MgbBwovOOoc,Which song starts at 1:57 ?
MgbBwovOOoc,That's a guy from PLL right? the hottie from Aria's gym! And the other one is the cousin Miguel? Someone here know? Teen Wolf fan here<3
MgbBwovOOoc,"Way to increase the creep factor of men everywhere, Universal."
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh it got pretty wet here LMAO
MgbBwovOOoc,Oh it got pretty wet here LMAO
MgbBwovOOoc,young derek tho.

MgbBwovOOoc,This movie looks so good 😍👌 can't wait for it! 
MgbBwovOOoc,Nem consegui ver o trailler de tão ruim que é.
MgbBwovOOoc,"For all of you old-school guys out there, this is like a Fatal Attraction in reverse"
MgbBwovOOoc,My husband and I can't wait til this movie come out we will be going to see it we don't care what the damn haters say we lovvvve us some JLO
MgbBwovOOoc,"What I wouldn't give to be the guy in this role, you can't blame him I'd be the same way it's j lo for crying out loud"
MgbBwovOOoc,Fatal Attraction + Obsessed = This movie
MgbBwovOOoc,lol this is the shit that never happens in real life...even on occasions that it did happen...the teacher usually gets sued or something...and that guy is way too old to still be in high school
MgbBwovOOoc,This is gonna be great!!! I want to see it so bad!
MgbBwovOOoc,"He looks like Theo James' brother. While watching all I was thinking was, it better not be him, it better not be him, please no, please, no, no, no.....*long breath* it's not him"
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks like it should be a Lifetime Movie.
MgbBwovOOoc,"This is very similar to beyonce's movie ""Obsessed"""
MgbBwovOOoc,the name of the song plz ?
MgbBwovOOoc,"I don't care how realistic or unrealistic is looks, I wanna see this!"
MgbBwovOOoc,Fkin creepy...I don't like this
MgbBwovOOoc,This reminds me of Fear with Mark Wahlberg. 
MgbBwovOOoc,This looks ******* awesome even though the plot is so wrong!!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,Dang!
MgbBwovOOoc,looks so good! cant wait!! :)
MgbBwovOOoc,this is going to be amazing!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,"Wait she's a cheating pedophile and we're supposed to like her?

MgbBwovOOoc,damn
MgbBwovOOoc,"Is ""noah"" supposed to look like he's in his late 20's? (Sizzlin hawt btw)
and dear god JLo just put it ALL away fgs"
MgbBwovOOoc,whispering by Alex clare!
MgbBwovOOoc,It seems pretty interesting!
MgbBwovOOoc,IAN NELSON aka BABY DEREK HALE
MgbBwovOOoc,
MgbBwovOOoc,Haha! The HOUSE next door!
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I LOVE YOUR MOTHERS COOKIES"" was that supposed to be dramatic? because I died oh my god."
MgbBwovOOoc,"i wish he lived next door to me,,,,,"
MgbBwovOOoc,<3 <3 <3..superrr
MgbBwovOOoc,You kill him girl
MgbBwovOOoc,"No way that  actor is like 16! Are you kidding me? If they're going to tackle a taboo subject,  at least do it right!"
MgbBwovOOoc,I can't wait to see this ! Looks great .
MgbBwovOOoc,I couldn't get past the innuendos! Lol
MgbBwovOOoc,This reminds me of a lifetime movie that i already saw but its JLO so im in.
MgbBwovOOoc,"At first I was thinking, ""Some type of fifty shades of MILF bullshit."" Then I kept on watching and thought, ""Damn I need to see this movie!"""
MgbBwovOOoc,"i'm not trying to hate, but this looks like a cheap bad lifetime movie."
MgbBwovOOoc,"""i love your mother cookies "" lol"
MgbBwovOOoc,"WHAT, is with all the new movies coming out about cheating wives, that are in an unhappy marriage. ugh. "
MgbBwovOOoc,"Enough J-Lo. We get it, you still have a nice body and you still can't act. Move along."
MgbBwovOOoc,1:18 Well it got pretty wet here lmao...
MgbBwovOOoc,I Will be lining up when this hits the theatres here in Nigeria!
MgbBwovOOoc,"Excelente Movie , i love Jennifer Lopez."
MgbBwovOOoc,So do I need to see this movie....or did they just show me the whole damn thing!! Can I be the person who makes the trailers from now on! I would be amazing. lmaoo. I would leave people wanting more! But who am I kidding I will probably be in the theatre watching this.
MgbBwovOOoc,Ryan Guzman <3
MgbBwovOOoc,"So they're going to portray a minor as being ""crazy"" for falling in love with a woman who seemed to be falling for him, but changed her mind after their one night stand because of guilt. Seems logical. Totally seems like he's the bad guy in this situation and not the other way around."
MgbBwovOOoc,If Jennifer Lopez give me the cheeks i will be obsessed too!! 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Se ve buenisima...buen regreso al cine de JLo, el chico igual esta rico jijiji"
MgbBwovOOoc,"""I love your mother's cookies.""  Hahahahahahahahaha!!!!!  I cannot wait to see this!"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Idk why, but it feels like I'm watching 50 shades of grey trailer. Besides that, trailer is FINALLY out. I've been waiting for this since March, but it gave too much away."
MgbBwovOOoc,"I've read the script and believe me, there is still more to this story than shown in the trailer ;-)"
MgbBwovOOoc,WOW!
MgbBwovOOoc,I guess they didn't use an actual teenager...so we don't feel like Lopez's character is a creepy perv.
MgbBwovOOoc,this is going to be amazing!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,so happy to see JLO back in movies.. ... this movie will be an epic movie of 2015
MgbBwovOOoc,A must watch movie for 2015.... jlo the best

MgbBwovOOoc,This is good....can't wait to see it
MgbBwovOOoc,What is this a cougar suspense thriller? Also Ryan Guzman aka the boy next door is not a teenager. He is already 26 years old in real life. This movie is invalid. 
MgbBwovOOoc,I'm glad I just watched this whole movie in 2 minutes and 41 seconds. 
MgbBwovOOoc,Wowwwwww ..great movie..I'm huge fan of jlo from philippines.
MgbBwovOOoc,Movie looks interesting.Would love JLo in a sci fi movie or super hero. 
MgbBwovOOoc,ok so the women took advantage of a teen boy and now she is the victim. 
MgbBwovOOoc,So excited for this!!! Ryan + Jenn in the same movie = HEAVEN
MgbBwovOOoc,i love J-Lo and all her glory but....pedophile much? i know the guy is not really a kid but he's supose to be so its still messed up....or is it okay to sleep with underage boy bc they r crazy psychopath who wants to box u up and tuck u in their closet 
MgbBwovOOoc,"Thats freaking weird, I'd be freaked out but anyways this seems like it will be interesting. "

MgbBwovOOoc,There is only one coca cola baby #queenjlo can't wait for #boynextdoor
MgbBwovOOoc,I don't blame her. I would have sex with Ryan Guzman too.

MgbBwovOOoc,AIDEN!!!
MgbBwovOOoc,Ryan Guzman!!! ♥♥♥♥♥
MgbBwovOOoc,"So is this an autobiographical film about Jlo? So far, it's a 8 out of 10, it would be a full 10 out of 10 but here she appeared to be a ""lady"" compared to what she is in her real life...Yeahh, J-HO!"
MgbBwovOOoc,"I hope she goes to jail at the end.
"
MgbBwovOOoc,"CHILE THAT RYAN GUZMAN IS SO FINE THAT IM NO LONGER DRY.

THANK YOU"
MgbBwovOOoc,"This actually looks like a good movie. And I don't see how jennifer lopez is a ""ho"" because I'm pretty sure we all make mistakes. The worst mistakes are the ones that people manipulate you into making. Hoes aren't the problem, it's the snakes around the corner watching you and waiting for you to slip up. "
MgbBwovOOoc,I'm just say it..... JAKE IS A!
MgbBwovOOoc,I like JLO's son. He's cute.
MgbBwovOOoc,"what else jennifer lopez can't do? wow!!!! a stunning woman. an iconic idol, a versatile actress, a smart enterprenuer '.and loving mother. i cant wait for january to come i will watch this movie again and again. here acting here its like on the enough movie onbe of my fave acting of j.lo as an actress. and wow! the boy next door is so attractive too! and good actor. i will count the ber month to finish then January comes i just hope it will be showing nationwide..."

MgbBwovOOoc,"Holy Shit!
She looks great but I always thought she go crazy not the boy"
MgbBwovOOoc,"Well, this looks like something which escaped showing in the evening on the Lifetime channel. What a pile of laughable crap. It’s like Nicholas Sparks watched Fatal Attraction on a loop and thought that he could attempt to replicate it to better success. You've got to love though how the director tried to shove in some car chase scenes, especially touting it as the guy who directed the first Fast and the Furious film, to try and win over the poor guys who’ll inevitably end up being dragged to this because “ooh! Pretty people in expensive clothes doing scary things”."
MgbBwovOOoc,"It looks good, definetely gonna watch this when it comes out :)"
MgbBwovOOoc,omg i want to see this movie now.. .. cant wait..
